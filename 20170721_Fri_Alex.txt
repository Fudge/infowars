[00:00.000 --> 00:26.920]  These aren't words, it's truth, it's not just claims, in fact, President Trump over
[00:26.920 --> 00:34.340]  and over again as candidate Trump said, Hillary and Obama, along with NATO and the globalist
[00:34.340 --> 00:41.080]  have armed radical Islam with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others, and they have turned them
[00:41.080 --> 00:45.760]  loose on our allies and they are murdering Christians en masse, and my Pentagon sources
[00:45.760 --> 00:51.120]  have advised me on this, and when I get into office we're going to destroy them in six
[00:51.120 --> 01:00.280]  months. Today is the six-month anniversary of his inauguration and his announcement to
[01:00.280 --> 01:07.720]  kill the TPP, to renegotiate NAFTA and GATT, to kill the carbon tax, to control our borders,
[01:07.720 --> 01:14.360]  and he's delivered in a royal flush. But the headlines from CNN in the New York Times,
[01:14.360 --> 01:20.880]  the Washington Post, MSNBC, ABC, NBCCBS is, Trump doesn't get one piece of major legislation
[01:20.880 --> 01:27.760]  through, Trump's a failure, Trump's in shambles, Trump's under criminal investigation, and
[01:27.760 --> 01:34.120]  yes, he hasn't gotten any major legislation, meaning tax cuts or Obamacare repeal through,
[01:34.120 --> 01:39.000]  but a lot of other stuff that is actually major, has gotten through massive regulations
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.320]  cut and he's gotten so much done via the executive branch because they were unconstitutionally
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.840]  doing most of their globalist agenda through it, he was able to turn that back on them
[01:49.840 --> 01:56.840]  and kill it and then watch the economy go from sputtering and faltering and stalling,
[01:56.840 --> 02:06.040]  roaring back. And now, the Federal Reserve announces huge increases coming in the next
[02:06.040 --> 02:15.840]  few months to the previous increases of the amount of money you have to pay to borrow.
[02:15.840 --> 02:21.120]  And as the interest increases, it's a wet blanket trying to stop the American system
[02:21.120 --> 02:29.840]  that empires have been trying to stop for 242 years. This is an amazing time to be alive.
[02:29.840 --> 02:35.240]  And I just tell it like it is, ladies and gentlemen, Trump has delivered and it is just
[02:35.240 --> 02:42.600]  over the top bizarre to see all these liars and scumbags sit there and spew their lies
[02:42.600 --> 02:49.200]  with a straight face because it is so over the top ridiculous. And to see McCain after
[02:49.200 --> 02:57.920]  serious brain surgery having a large, malignant, fast-acting, most deadly brain tumor there
[02:57.920 --> 03:05.880]  is, associated with cell phone radiation, even Newsweek's admitting that, saying Trump's
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.080]  doing a horrible thing in Syria that he's with the Russians. Our military made that
[03:11.080 --> 03:16.080]  deal five years ago and told Obama we weren't going to back him. And now, we've smashed
[03:16.080 --> 03:23.440]  ISIS and Assad's making noises about leaving, which is a deal he agreed to once they kicked
[03:23.440 --> 03:27.520]  the invading forces out of the country and the White House has come out and said we want
[03:27.520 --> 03:34.000]  to see Assad now begin to move to leave. Ending the wars, ending the civil wars, ending the
[03:34.000 --> 03:41.440]  al-Qaeda ISIS offensive. Now having al-Qaeda and ISIS in two small neighborhoods of two
[03:41.440 --> 03:47.280]  cities, absolutely on the run and admitting they've been destroyed. Of course, they came
[03:47.280 --> 03:52.840]  in on their convoys from all over the Middle East, from all over the world, protected by
[03:52.840 --> 04:00.120]  Obama by Hillary, the modern founders of the al-Qaeda, Wahhabist al-Nazra, known as ISIS
[04:00.120 --> 04:06.760]  Islamic State is their country between Syria and Iraq. And they spin that with their bizarre
[04:06.760 --> 04:14.920]  twisted upside down inverted alchemy that Trump is bad for cleaning up their treasonous
[04:14.920 --> 04:21.240]  outrageous criminal activities that they and CNN and others backed and promoted and funded
[04:21.240 --> 04:25.960]  and he signed an order killing all funding to the rebels because they're all al-Qaeda.
[04:25.960 --> 04:32.360]  Let's go out to break with the president to their heart saying ISIS is falling fast while
[04:32.360 --> 05:01.240]  visiting with the military. This will be a day long remembered. Globalism is falling.
[05:01.240 --> 05:05.360]  The 6% of Americans say the Russian collusion conspiracy theory is important. The Daily
[05:05.360 --> 05:08.680]  Wire pointed out that in a Bloomberg survey pulling Americans on what they feel is the
[05:08.680 --> 05:13.000]  most important issues concerning the Trump administration, 35% said healthcare, 13% said
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.600]  the economy, 11% said terrorism, and immediately 6% said President Trump's relationship with
[05:17.600 --> 05:21.640]  Russia was an important issue for them. Then why does the mainstream media spend so much
[05:21.640 --> 05:25.880]  time focusing on the Russia conspiracy theory? Simple, they want to undermine the Trump presidency
[05:25.880 --> 05:30.320]  to appease their bosses. The globalist owners of major news corporations. You see the best
[05:30.320 --> 05:33.960]  forms of propaganda spread through deception. In the mainstream media role plays as objective
[05:33.960 --> 05:37.480]  journalists while pushing a globalist agenda. But don't take it from me. Just look at the
[05:37.480 --> 05:41.440]  Bloomberg article that accompanied the poll. Americans feel good about the economy, not
[05:41.440 --> 05:44.960]  so good about Trump, the headline read. No really. The top three issues that Americans
[05:44.960 --> 05:48.720]  find important are the top issues that President Trump ran on during his campaign. The mainstream
[05:48.720 --> 05:52.840]  media hates Trump for bringing back Americana in the belief in national self-determination.
[05:52.840 --> 05:56.440]  And that's why they keep pushing the Russian collusion conspiracy theory, which CNN's
[05:56.440 --> 06:01.340]  Van Jones even admitted was a nothing burger. This is Kit Daniels with Infowars.com.
[06:01.340 --> 06:06.320]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information. And in the
[06:06.320 --> 06:10.800]  last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the
[06:10.800 --> 06:16.280]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases
[06:16.280 --> 06:22.000]  had much better nutrition than we do today. And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.280]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing and then processing. And so I set out to develop
[06:27.280 --> 06:33.160]  caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other super
[06:33.160 --> 06:40.200]  food ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time. Infowars isn't
[06:40.200 --> 06:45.120]  just fighting the globalist. We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of

[08:00.800 --> 08:23.360]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance. It's
[08:23.360 --> 08:37.720]  Alex Jones. It's Friday, the 21st day of July, 2017. We have a loaded raft of informative
[08:37.720 --> 08:44.200]  guests today. I'm going to work on getting Roger Stone on as we speak because Mr. Scaramucci
[08:44.200 --> 08:48.440]  is next in line to be communications director at the White House and that's the word is
[08:48.440 --> 08:54.240]  that he's who's being looked at to be announced probably next week. After Sean Spicer just
[08:54.240 --> 09:01.240]  resigned, the news was announced two minutes ago. So that is breaking. Sean Spicer resigned
[09:01.240 --> 09:07.760]  his White House press secretary, the embattled press secretary, Sean Spicer, the White House
[09:07.760 --> 09:12.480]  press secretary, resigned on Friday morning telling President Trump he vehemently disagreed
[09:12.480 --> 09:19.640]  with the appointment of the New York financier Anthony Scaramucci as communications director.
[09:19.640 --> 09:25.080]  So I guess that's going to be announced. Mr. Trump offered Mr. Scaramucci the job at 10
[09:25.080 --> 09:30.560]  a.m. The president requested that Mr. Spicer stay on. Mr. Spicer told Mr. Trump that he
[09:30.560 --> 09:33.840]  believed the appointment was a major mistake according to a person with direct knowledge
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.760]  of the exchange. You see, I hadn't even seen this New York Times piece yet. I just knew
[09:37.760 --> 09:42.640]  that inner workings a few months ago and a few weeks ago from my sources that Scaramucci
[09:42.640 --> 09:48.240]  was being looked at. I just learned it during the break when they just said boom on Fox
[09:48.240 --> 09:53.480]  News that the resignation had come. They pulled up the New York Times who's always got their
[09:53.480 --> 09:58.600]  ear to the ground. And I guess the word is from Spicer who's constantly leaking information
[09:58.600 --> 10:04.560]  to anybody that'll listen that he doesn't like Scaramucci. Who by the way, they would
[10:04.560 --> 10:08.840]  do stuff in the last six months like come in and say the president has fired you. Get
[10:08.840 --> 10:15.040]  your stuff and get out. That's what rents previous would do. And then Scaramucci would
[10:15.040 --> 10:21.640]  call some of his confidants and they'd say don't go. Say you want to meet with the president
[10:21.640 --> 10:25.320]  and you want to see it in a letter. And then the president would be like, I didn't fire
[10:25.320 --> 10:31.400]  Scaramucci. And Scaramucci the whole time has been given the president accurate intel
[10:31.400 --> 10:36.480]  on what they're planning. And that's why the globalists are completely panicking right
[10:36.480 --> 10:41.760]  now because they're getting rid of the people they can't trust that are rhinos that are
[10:41.760 --> 10:48.300]  neocons that are playing both sides that are scared like Spicer hiding the bushes when
[10:48.300 --> 10:53.560]  Trump fired the FBI director. You don't need people that are hiding in the bushes having
[10:53.560 --> 11:00.800]  panic attacks and drinking gallons of vodka on the job. Spicer reportedly has a little
[11:00.800 --> 11:07.800]  refrigerator full of vodka that he's imbibing in quite quite quite a bit. And I don't want
[11:07.800 --> 11:12.120]  to sit there and attack Spicer, but I know all this stuff about Spicer from multiple
[11:12.120 --> 11:18.080]  sources and I never released any of it because he wasn't publicly going against the president.
[11:18.080 --> 11:29.080]  But Spicer is showing his hand now jumping ship publicly because Mueller, who 98% plus
[11:29.080 --> 11:36.320]  of his donations from his law firm are to the Democratic Party and to Bill and Hillary
[11:36.320 --> 11:42.040]  Clinton. Yes, he was appointed by George W. Bush, who's a globalist, covered up the
[11:42.040 --> 11:47.560]  Saudi involvement in 9 11 covered up so much. And so that's the bottom line of what's going
[11:47.560 --> 11:57.840]  on behind the scenes is the Scaramucci is a banon constitutional patriot. And they have
[11:57.840 --> 12:05.280]  been trying to shut him down and get him fired since day one. And repeatedly, they would
[12:05.280 --> 12:12.480]  leak stuff trying to get Scaramucci in trouble. And so this is a very good sign that when
[12:12.480 --> 12:24.560]  they tried to put Scaramucci over Spicer that he flipped out and left, the moles are being
[12:24.560 --> 12:32.360]  exercised from the host. Anthony Scaramucci expected to be named White House Communication
[12:32.360 --> 12:38.760]  Director. And I heard this months ago, and I just kept my little trap shut. And boy,
[12:38.760 --> 12:45.640]  I tell you, that just proves how good our sources are. That is amazing. Guys, they've
[12:45.640 --> 12:51.160]  got my cell phone. The crew does because do was downloading videos I shot this morning.
[12:51.160 --> 12:55.640]  You get me my phone because I need to call some of these sources during the next break.
[12:55.640 --> 13:01.160]  I need to call some people I have pretty close to the old White House leave it to you that
[13:01.160 --> 13:11.880]  way. But wow, because I heard this months ago. And I thought that it was a bit fanciful
[13:11.880 --> 13:18.760]  because if this happens, and this is accurate, it means the other stuff I was told was accurate.
[13:18.760 --> 13:23.720]  These sources have only been accurate. I mean, some of these sources are as high as you can
[13:23.720 --> 13:29.080]  go in the executive branchals. Leave it to media knows that doesn't like that. But this
[13:29.080 --> 13:36.560]  is such a good sign. Trump is so real. This just boggles my mind how real he is, how amazing
[13:36.560 --> 13:42.000]  is. Let's get Sarnovich on to pop in. Let's get Roger Stone. I know you guys have been
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.760]  calling for 10 minutes. He hasn't been answering, but I need to get him on immediately. I need
[13:46.760 --> 13:54.400]  to talk to him. He's already on. He's already on at 1230, huh? Just get him on now. Get
[13:54.400 --> 13:59.320]  him on now and come back on at 1232 because he'll know more than because I need to talk
[13:59.320 --> 14:03.360]  to him during the break to I don't know. He's one of my sources, obviously, but I've got
[14:03.360 --> 14:08.640]  four others. I'm just going to leave it at that. And they've all said the same thing
[14:08.640 --> 14:17.200]  about this internal battle going on, but I want to be real careful about how much I release.
[14:17.200 --> 14:22.000]  And Roger is officially working here. He'll officially be employed by Info Wars as a contractor.
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.320]  This is the term August 1st. Hey, buddy, I'm live on air right now. I've got you on air.
[14:28.320 --> 14:32.800]  I know you're on at one 30 your time, 1230. Mine that can you pop in right now about
[14:32.800 --> 14:42.480]  Tascara Mochi and all this. Yes, Nico will call you right now. I'm ready. Thank you.
[14:42.480 --> 14:50.000]  So he's got most other phone numbers on do not stir. His phone rings constantly, but
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.920]  he doesn't have my number on do not stir. That's why I've got a call for Nico. It's
[14:52.920 --> 14:59.320]  not Nico's fault. We need to make sure he gets your number off. Do not disturb. I don't
[14:59.320 --> 15:03.640]  blame him. I've seen him. He takes his phone off. You don't serve. It's ringing continually
[15:03.640 --> 15:07.160]  hundreds of messages an hour. So I've got a secretary sitting there in the day trying
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.000]  to handle it, but you can't get a holder Roger stone at night. I mean, his phone just rings,
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.040]  rings, rings, rings, rings, rings. It's insane because you wouldn't be able to make a phone
[15:16.040 --> 15:23.040]  call if you didn't have it on do not stir. So we're gonna, yeah, I'm going to not talk
[15:23.040 --> 15:28.120]  about this right now until I talk to Roger. We'll talk to him on air and see what, how
[15:28.120 --> 15:32.960]  much he thinks we ought to put out here. But let me just tell you something. This country
[15:32.960 --> 15:37.000]  is in the middle of a civil war. If you're watching on Facebook, you notice the headline
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.600]  is Obama prepared military for martial law on election day. I told you this previously
[15:43.600 --> 15:49.320]  because I was told this by army sources. I have in special operations that they'd never
[15:49.320 --> 15:53.880]  seen such a mobilization and that they believe that conservatives might fight back with Hillary
[15:53.880 --> 16:06.560]  won. But as you notice, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray. Madam president,
[16:06.560 --> 16:11.200]  I bought this for like $3 and 25 cents off eBay. They printed hundreds of thousands
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.560]  of them. They didn't print Mr. President Newsweek special editions, commemorative editions here.
[16:16.560 --> 16:21.520]  Let's, let's just look at the commemorative edition. But the big news here is they had
[16:21.520 --> 16:26.160]  martial law prepared to basically take over the states, take over the government in case
[16:26.160 --> 16:29.720]  there was a rebellion by the states. But because we actually had an election, they were unable
[16:29.720 --> 16:34.440]  to steal all the states. They stole five, try to steal an additional six. They were unable
[16:34.440 --> 16:38.640]  to go ahead and launch that martial law plan. Now they've got an ongoing civil war inside
[16:38.640 --> 16:44.160]  the deep state going on. It's not really deep state against us. It's, it's a deep state
[16:44.160 --> 16:52.120]  civil war. And the public is critical deciding which way this is going to go. Obama's secret
[16:52.120 --> 16:57.880]  plan to deploy the military on election day. That's out of the New York post. Zero hedge
[16:57.880 --> 17:01.960]  has it. The documents now public. Homeland security was going to federalize the nation
[17:01.960 --> 17:06.080]  basically. And now look at the president's advisory commission election fraud already
[17:06.080 --> 17:13.880]  has found 1000 proven cases of election and voter fraud. And with indexes from Harvard,
[17:13.880 --> 17:19.880]  they now the computer algorithm shows 5.7 million were estimated to have voted illegally
[17:19.880 --> 17:26.960]  or repeatedly in dead people's names. That's Harvard. That's why they're like, Oh, there's
[17:26.960 --> 17:32.560]  no election fraud. While the Democrats brag in what 11 states they tried to pass laws
[17:32.560 --> 17:40.160]  to let illegals vote. They're trying to legalize illegals voting. They've got voter programs
[17:40.160 --> 17:44.440]  to get them registered in all these Democrat states where you can't show an ID and you
[17:44.440 --> 17:49.280]  get a voter registration card. Oh, but and we have all the Democratic officials on video
[17:49.280 --> 17:56.520]  like eight different ones from New York, Chicago, DC, national saying, Oh, we have, you know,
[17:56.520 --> 18:00.240]  people voting at least 10 times in dead people's names. We bust them around. There's not an
[18:00.240 --> 18:08.280]  effing thing. Skip this break. There's not a effing thing. Quote, the American people
[18:08.280 --> 18:12.880]  can do about this. And then they go, Oh, don't look into election fraud. And then we look
[18:12.880 --> 18:19.160]  and everywhere we look, it's intense election fraud, organizing voter fraud. Because they
[18:19.160 --> 18:23.320]  confuse it between retail voter fraud, election fraud, it's all election fraud. There isn't
[18:23.320 --> 18:27.480]  anybody engaged in voter fraud. They've ever caught this doing it on their own. It's being
[18:27.480 --> 18:32.480]  directed off of obituary databases, looking at voter rolls and then handing out the names
[18:32.480 --> 18:40.200]  and busing people to precincts on average 10 times a day to vote on election day. Joining
[18:40.200 --> 18:44.320]  us is Roger Stone. Roger, I'm glad you could come on on such short notice. You're already
[18:44.320 --> 18:49.520]  scheduled to be on coming up in about an hour because obviously you've been an amazing source
[18:49.520 --> 18:54.880]  on scaramucci. Other sources told me the same thing that if the realignment did happen and
[18:54.880 --> 19:00.720]  that we brought in ban and type patriots that that we would see scaramucci put in as communications
[19:00.720 --> 19:08.680]  director separately, we also know that there's been a full on push to remove scaramucci,
[19:08.680 --> 19:14.440]  but but they failed from my intel, which you're just obviously part of. But I've got it from
[19:14.440 --> 19:19.880]  other sources as well. This shows a major realignments about to happen. Just like day
[19:19.880 --> 19:23.920]  70, he kind of turned towards the establishment, trying to work with them because they lied
[19:23.920 --> 19:28.440]  to him and said they would he wanted to compromise just to get stuff done. He's so worried about
[19:28.440 --> 19:33.240]  economy stalling. As he said, they screwed him 30 days later, he turned back towards
[19:33.240 --> 19:38.600]  populism hardcore with a serious jerk to the right in their view. And now I think this
[19:38.600 --> 19:44.720]  is going to signify he's going into full war mode with them with the Mueller fishing expedition.
[19:44.720 --> 19:48.000]  He's not going to wait till they kill the economy and then try to bring him down. He's
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.680]  going to try to rally the people and absolutely go into full war mode, which is the only way
[19:52.680 --> 19:58.200]  to be victorious. Is that an accurate analysis? Roger Stone, I think that's a pretty good
[19:58.200 --> 20:03.560]  assessment of the situation. First of all, the appointment of Anthony Scaramucci, who
[20:03.560 --> 20:09.200]  is a very capable guy, a true patriot and a Trump loyalist. His loyalty is not to the
[20:09.200 --> 20:16.640]  Republican Party. It's to combat the Trump agenda is has long been resisted by Ryan's
[20:16.640 --> 20:24.480]  previous Sean Spicer and the establishment mandarins within the Trump White House. I
[20:24.480 --> 20:30.520]  think this shift is really a manifestation of the extremely poor handling of the Donald
[20:30.520 --> 20:38.440]  Trump Jr saga, which the White House allowed to drip drop out over almost a 10 day period,
[20:38.440 --> 20:43.840]  as opposed to releasing it all the Friday before our last holiday, which they were urged
[20:43.840 --> 20:51.000]  to do and they stay rejected. And again, any more on a college level journalism course
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.360]  knows you bury something on a Friday evening, you dump it all. So that was deliberate them.
[20:56.360 --> 21:01.520]  And now Spicer proving his true colors is in the New York Times saying how horrible
[21:01.520 --> 21:06.040]  scaramucci is and that that's why he left. So he is not just leaving. He's stabbing the
[21:06.040 --> 21:11.000]  president in the back, which reportedly he's been doing behind the scenes the entire time.
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.600]  It's not nearly disloyal. Of course, we have to remember he was never for Donald Trump
[21:15.600 --> 21:21.280]  who president. Anyway, this is the same Sean Spicer said back in September of last year.
[21:21.280 --> 21:27.560]  If Trump didn't get his poll numbers up, the Republican National Committee should suspend
[21:27.560 --> 21:33.640]  its financial support of his candidacy unheard of, just unheard of, completely ignored the
[21:33.640 --> 21:38.520]  fact that the Republican National Committee is exists as the pleasure and the pleasure
[21:38.520 --> 21:43.480]  of a nominee and certainly of the president just thinks shows that they think that they
[21:43.480 --> 21:47.520]  are a fight them and an establishment organization unto themselves.
[21:47.520 --> 21:52.960]  Does this signify though that with Mueller's biggest fishing expedition in history, 98%
[21:52.960 --> 21:59.160]  plus 98.6% of the donations, the law firm of Mueller to the Democrats to Hillary De
[21:59.160 --> 22:04.440]  Bill, expanding it to all his associates, the whole campaign, all financials. No one's
[22:04.440 --> 22:08.800]  perfect according to federal law. They can indict a ham sandwich as they as the FBI director
[22:08.800 --> 22:14.160]  famously said. How far is this going to go? To me, this signifies Trump's batting down
[22:14.160 --> 22:21.360]  the hatches, which is good. And it also signifies that Spicer's evacuating because he thinks
[22:21.360 --> 22:27.880]  that he's siding with the deep state. I think you have to read between the lines of the
[22:27.880 --> 22:33.360]  president's terrific interview with the New York Times conducted by Maggie Abram, where
[22:33.360 --> 22:39.240]  he correctly, I think, expressed a lack of confidence in Jeff Sessions. I mean, we have
[22:39.240 --> 22:46.000]  now a fight the court decision, proving that the Obama administration illegally surveilled
[22:46.000 --> 22:51.520]  spied on and charted the phone calls and in other communications of tens of thousands
[22:51.520 --> 22:59.120]  of Eric illegally unmasked them all for political purposes. Yet Obama has not been arrested.
[22:59.120 --> 23:02.800]  Susan Rice has not been arrested. James Clapper has not been arrested.
[23:02.800 --> 23:06.960]  And you've got Hillary with all the illegal servers, all the uranium, all the Chinese,
[23:06.960 --> 23:11.440]  Russian deals, and they're they're they're completely dirty, caught red handed. And they
[23:11.440 --> 23:16.720]  pointed Trump, who's done nothing wrong, but tried to find dirt on Hillary and say, remove
[23:16.720 --> 23:20.600]  him. You're right. He's got to move against him. Here is the president surreptitiously
[23:20.600 --> 23:29.200]  again, I guess, recorded by the New York Times. But here it is Sessions gets the job. Right
[23:29.200 --> 23:35.920]  after he gets the job, he recuses himself. Was that a mistake? Well, Sessions should
[23:35.920 --> 23:41.080]  have never recused himself. And if he would, if he was going to recuse himself, he should
[23:41.080 --> 23:44.720]  have told me before he took the job, and I would pick somebody else. He gave him no
[23:44.720 --> 23:57.960]  heads up at all. Zero. So Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself.
[23:57.960 --> 24:04.880]  I then have which, which frankly, I think it's very unfair to the president. How do
[24:04.880 --> 24:10.040]  you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job,
[24:10.040 --> 24:14.320]  I would have said, thanks, Jeff, but I can't, you know, I can thank you. It's extremely
[24:14.320 --> 24:21.200]  unfair. And that's a mild word to the president. So he recuses himself. Now, let's be specific.
[24:21.200 --> 24:25.920]  This is one of the most important things I've ever said. So please listen carefully, listeners.
[24:25.920 --> 24:31.240]  This country's gotten run into a ditch by people covering their butts. CYA. We're going
[24:31.240 --> 24:35.280]  into entropy. We're going into collapse. And I like Sessions. He's been an honorable man.
[24:35.280 --> 24:39.320]  He killed open borders and globalism four times in the Senate when they were trying
[24:39.320 --> 24:45.040]  to pass bills secretly. I like Sessions, but judges don't recuse themselves unless they've
[24:45.040 --> 24:49.720]  got a conflict. He doesn't have a conflict. He never did anything. He got bullied and
[24:49.720 --> 24:55.900]  intimidated in CYA. And if the Republican party keeps doing their old CYA, the Democrats
[24:55.900 --> 25:00.680]  are going to overthrow the entire system and bring in martial law as is in the New York
[25:00.680 --> 25:08.360]  Post and the Atlantic Monthly. They admit they know they've lost the mind of the people.
[25:08.360 --> 25:13.120]  They admit they've committed all these crimes. They're going for broke. They're cornered rats.
[25:13.120 --> 25:18.280]  You can give them no quarter. Roger, I'm ranting. Recap about Scaramucci. Recap what this really
[25:18.280 --> 25:23.080]  signifies with Spicer. Recap why you think it's good that he's exposing what's happening
[25:23.080 --> 25:27.320]  with Sessions. And I totally agree. He's got to go all out now while he's still got the
[25:27.320 --> 25:31.080]  people behind him, or they're going to bring not just him down, but this country. This
[25:31.080 --> 25:37.560]  is America on Death Watch with the Democratic Party allied with Orthodox radical Islam,
[25:37.560 --> 25:43.960]  anti-God, anti-Christian, anti-family. They mean to finish us. We must now finish them.
[25:43.960 --> 25:49.040]  Stone. Alex, I think it's very important people understand the ramifications of what we're
[25:49.040 --> 25:56.640]  talking about. When Jeff Sessions recused himself on the question of Russia, that empowered
[25:56.640 --> 26:02.160]  the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, and turned around and appointed one of his
[26:02.160 --> 26:08.000]  best friends, Robert Mueller, to investigate the president. Rosenstein has worked for the
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.080]  Bushes and the Clintons. Why he's even in the Trump Justice Department is a question
[26:14.080 --> 26:20.800]  of some note. Wall Street Journal hailed his appointment saying that he would be a leavening
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.040]  influence on the right wing Jeff Sessions. Give you some idea where this guy's coming
[26:25.040 --> 26:32.960]  from. He, based on his own authority, directed by no one, hired appointed Mueller as a special
[26:32.960 --> 26:39.440]  counsel. In other words, as the executioner. Now, normally special counsels are appointed
[26:39.440 --> 26:44.320]  when there is an enormous wealth of evidence that a crime has been committed. AKA the Clintons.
[26:44.320 --> 26:51.360]  Okay. In this case, there is none. And also when the Justice Department has some egregious
[26:51.920 --> 26:58.000]  conflict, Jeff Sessions met twice with the ambassador of the Soviet Union. And he couldn't
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.240]  even call the meetings. He met him, he passed by him in a reception and they exchanged words.
[27:02.240 --> 27:07.280]  And that's what senators do. Particularly senators who are members of the Senate Foreign
[27:07.280 --> 27:11.680]  Relations Committee. It's part of their job. Pelosi met 30 something times.
[27:13.360 --> 27:19.680]  So in this particular case, the reason we have Mueller, the reason we have the sort of democles
[27:19.680 --> 27:25.760]  hanging over the president's head and left this clot to remove him with despite of a
[27:25.760 --> 27:32.080]  absence of evidence is because Jeff Sessions recused himself. Simply that we would not be
[27:32.080 --> 27:38.720]  where we are today. We're that not the case. What the president must do now is to fire Rosenstein
[27:39.760 --> 27:45.840]  and fire Mueller. And then if they want to try to impeach him, take all commerce on the basis of what?
[27:46.400 --> 27:52.640]  Mueller's coaching of Comey just prior to his testimony. There's the reason for his firing.
[27:52.640 --> 27:58.320]  Absolutely. And the president, there's no partiality. And the president has the trifecta now.
[27:58.320 --> 28:02.720]  He's got to move against these criminals now. Let's play a clip from Newt Gennrich laying it out.
[28:02.720 --> 28:12.000]  Here it is. The Mueller investigation has so many conflicts of interest. It's almost an absurdity.
[28:12.880 --> 28:22.160]  The law firm he comes from gave 99.81% of his donations to Hillary Clinton last year.
[28:22.160 --> 28:30.640]  That's right. 0.19 of 1% went to Donald Trump. The people that he's been hiring are all anti-Trump
[28:30.640 --> 28:37.440]  lawyers. Several of them have very bad records of hiding information from the defense. And one case
[28:37.440 --> 28:43.760]  was rebuked by the Supreme Court on a 9-0 vote. And it's hard to understand why he would assemble
[28:43.760 --> 28:49.120]  such a team unless it was a deliberate effort to go after the president and the president's team.
[28:49.120 --> 28:58.000]  I think that this is the most biased lynch mob of executioners ever assembled in modern history.
[28:58.000 --> 29:03.760]  Even real Democrat liberals like Dershowitz and Jonathan Turley are saying this is insane.
[29:03.760 --> 29:09.200]  The president should fire all these people. This is a rogue group and the media is acting like
[29:09.200 --> 29:13.200]  Mueller's the new president and that he's Jesus Christ come down from heaven.
[29:13.200 --> 29:18.880]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary. If you go to my page, the Stone Cold Truth, I wrote a piece
[29:18.880 --> 29:22.800]  about a week ago called The Three Amigos. It's important to understand the extent to which
[29:22.800 --> 29:28.880]  Rosenstein, Comey, and Mueller are best friends. They have aided each other's career. They have
[29:28.880 --> 29:34.320]  covered for each other. And they have all been executioners for the Bushes and the Clintons.
[29:34.320 --> 29:38.720]  That's right. These guys work for the deep state. We're going to post your article at infowars.com.
[29:38.720 --> 29:42.960]  Roger Stone, stay there. I want to talk about what Trump needs to do now. This is a big deal.
[29:42.960 --> 29:46.000]  Five more minutes on the other side than all day of the news. Stay with us. Roger Stone's
[29:46.000 --> 29:52.160]  coming up again later via video Skype. I'm Alan Jones. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:53.040 --> 29:55.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.880 --> 30:05.520]  Just 6% of Americans say the Russian collusion conspiracy theory is important. The data wire
[30:05.520 --> 30:09.120]  pointed out that in a Bloomberg survey pulling Americans on what they feel is the most important
[30:09.120 --> 30:13.440]  issues concerning the Trump administration, 35% said healthcare, 13% said the economy,
[30:13.440 --> 30:18.000]  11% said terrorism, and immediately 6% said President Trump's relationship with Russia
[30:18.000 --> 30:22.320]  was an important issue for them. Then why does the mainstream media spend so much time focusing
[30:22.320 --> 30:26.240]  on the Russia conspiracy theory? Simple. They want to undermine the Trump presidency to appease
[30:26.240 --> 30:30.960]  their bosses. The globalist owners of major news corporations. You see the best forms of propaganda
[30:30.960 --> 30:34.800]  spread through deception. And the mainstream media role plays as objective journalists while pushing
[30:34.800 --> 30:38.720]  a globalist agenda. But don't take it from me. Just look at the Bloomberg article that accompanied
[30:38.720 --> 30:42.800]  the poll. Americans feel good about the economy, not so good about Trump, the headline read.
[30:42.800 --> 30:46.720]  No, really. The top three issues that Americans find important are the top issues that President
[30:46.720 --> 30:50.960]  Trump ran on during his campaign. The mainstream media hates Trump for bringing back Americana
[30:50.960 --> 30:54.320]  in the belief in national self-determination. And that's why they keep pushing the Russian
[30:54.320 --> 30:58.480]  collusion conspiracy theory, which CNN's Van Jones even admitted was a nothing burger. This is

[31:04.320 --> 31:08.880]  that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial
[31:08.880 --> 31:15.360]  particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based

[32:04.880 --> 32:09.600]  arrived the M fours warehouse in Austin, Texas. We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list
[32:09.600 --> 32:13.760]  who signed up for auto ship to receive out of stock products like DNA force. And we are now
[32:13.760 --> 32:17.920]  once again expected to sell out very, very soon. When it comes to a formula that is such a game
[32:17.920 --> 32:22.720]  changer like DNA force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply
[32:22.720 --> 32:27.840]  of the key ingredients. The secret behind DNA force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients
[32:27.840 --> 32:35.040]  like go q 10 systematic enzymes in ar lipoic acid bio pqq and many others bio pqq alone is backed
[32:35.040 --> 32:41.040]  by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies and just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.

[33:16.480 --> 33:22.080]  in about five minutes. He's gonna be back on later. And guess who else is on Michael Caputo
[33:22.080 --> 33:30.640]  of the White House of the Trump operations that they've been demonizing and going after
[33:30.640 --> 33:35.760]  and claiming that, you know, this guy was in the campaign is somehow working for the Russians
[33:35.760 --> 33:43.760]  because he was sent in by the CIA as part of USAID to keep Yeltsin in power. And so then they use
[33:43.760 --> 33:50.480]  the file on him to then say, Oh, look, he lived in Russia for 10 years. This is next level. He's
[33:50.480 --> 33:54.320]  going to be joining us because he testified in secret just like they wanted stone to do.
[33:55.120 --> 34:00.000]  Then they gave a transcript to the congresswoman, but not to the media or him and then accused him
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.280]  of perjury. So that's coming up. Give us a little foray, a little, little preview of that, Roger.
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.960]  And then let's get back into just a recap of what this signifies. Sean Spicer being
[34:13.520 --> 34:17.760]  basically having Anthony Scaramucci put over him who's a patriot and then saying, fine, he's
[34:17.760 --> 34:22.720]  leaving and then giving his reasons of the New York Times extremely disloyal. So, so what does
[34:22.720 --> 34:28.960]  this overall signify? A total lack of professionalism in my opinion. You've never seen this from
[34:28.960 --> 34:34.160]  Michael Caputo. Michael Caputo is a young conservative. I met him when he was this press
[34:34.160 --> 34:41.040]  secretary for congressman Jack Kemp. The long active and anti-communist activities actually
[34:41.040 --> 34:49.200]  helped the freedom fighters in Nicaragua. And he did work for the United States information.
[34:53.840 --> 34:57.840]  Let's, let's back up here for a minute then. What would you advise the president to do or
[34:57.840 --> 35:02.960]  the public at this point to promote and push in lobby for in this civil war? The Democrats
[35:02.960 --> 35:07.680]  admit they basically started because they admit they want to declare the entire election to be
[35:07.680 --> 35:12.960]  a fraud once they get Trump and remove many Republicans who were elected in 2016, put homeland
[35:12.960 --> 35:19.760]  security over the elections thereafter, controlled by the Democrats and basically ending our political
[35:19.760 --> 35:25.680]  system as we know it and completing our mission into being a country like Venezuela. Number
[35:25.680 --> 35:33.520]  one, begin the prosecutions of the Obama national security gang, Ben Rhodes, Susan Rice, Valerie
[35:33.520 --> 35:41.520]  Jarrett, Clapper, Brennan, Rogers over the, over the unmask. You do not win on defense. You only
[35:41.520 --> 35:46.240]  win on offense. They have broken the law and these are crimes far more serious than the water
[35:46.240 --> 35:50.800]  gate. Secondarily, we need election law reform and the president's doing the right thing with
[35:50.800 --> 35:55.920]  this election commission. And we've already proven that the mainstream claim that there is no voter
[35:55.920 --> 36:02.800]  fraud is a fraud itself. American people need to know that. Secondarily, I think the president's
[36:02.800 --> 36:07.200]  got his, thirdly, he's got to go his own way on healthcare and particularly on the corporate tax
[36:07.200 --> 36:12.880]  cut should not let the establishment Republicans get him off of his reform agenda. Only a radical
[36:12.880 --> 36:21.520]  reform agenda is going to rally our voters to the 2018 election and no more closed door hearings
[36:21.520 --> 36:26.000]  on anything pertaining to Russia. Let's have it all right out front with the American people
[36:26.000 --> 36:32.800]  could hear it all. House and Senate, what they did to Michael Caputo, having testified in secret,
[36:32.800 --> 36:39.200]  that accusing of a perjury when he has no access to the transcript, nor does the public, that's
[36:39.200 --> 36:43.600]  a kangaroo court. That's something else I've noticed is almost everybody they're going after
[36:43.600 --> 36:50.720]  has an Italian last name. Is there some type of underlying washbush or establishment east coast
[36:50.720 --> 36:57.280]  Harvard discrimination there? Cause I know in the old blue blood elites that goes on. You know,
[36:57.280 --> 37:01.760]  it's funny you should mention that when I was on WPN in Buffalo with Michael Caputo the other day,
[37:01.760 --> 37:07.520]  we mused about the fact that we're both Italian Americans and that we're in the crossfire.
[37:07.520 --> 37:12.880]  As has been, there are unfortunately still a lot of people out there who think that just because
[37:12.880 --> 37:22.000]  you're Italian America, to me, it was organized crime. It's really insulting. Well, maybe you
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.240]  guys are just loyal to America and not trying to sell the country out. We're loyal to Donald
[37:28.240 --> 37:34.320]  Trump and we're loyal to try to see this country. All right, Roger, get to your skype. Absolutely,
[37:34.320 --> 37:39.280]  we're going to talk to you in an hour via skype. Thank you, Roger. Go for it. Stonecultured.com
[37:39.280 --> 37:44.080]  or infowars.com. Let me just stop at this moment for just a second with everybody.
[37:46.800 --> 37:51.840]  Twitter has announced, quote, they've increased censorship 10 times from last year.
[37:53.360 --> 37:59.200]  Now that's Twitter saying we're censoring and we've increased it 10 fold against conservatives
[37:59.200 --> 38:04.000]  and libertarians. You're not going to bully liberals. So while they're saying kill Trump, kill
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.360]  Alex Jones, kill everybody, beating people up, the head of Twitter, there it is in recode,
[38:09.360 --> 38:14.560]  says it will punish 10 times more users for being abusive than it was a year ago. They're just
[38:14.560 --> 38:19.600]  introducing us to communist Chinese style. You're not allowed to show the president, the dictator
[38:19.600 --> 38:24.480]  of China with Winnie the Pooh, because that's quote abusive as well. They call it bullying.
[38:25.440 --> 38:30.800]  Literally, that was a popular meme in China. You get forced labor three years for showing an image
[38:30.800 --> 38:36.000]  of him with Winnie the Pooh. And it's the same thing here. So Twitter has been blocking us.
[38:37.120 --> 38:42.080]  YouTube has been blocking us. Mark Dice is coming up later. He got blocked out of his YouTube for
[38:42.080 --> 38:46.800]  a few days. They were just going to shut it down. They've told us that they're on the verge of shutting
[38:46.800 --> 38:54.880]  down our main channel with plus to two billion views and two plus million subscribers. And that's
[38:54.880 --> 39:03.600]  just one of our many channels. Just our channels have four billion views altogether. Fan channels,
[39:03.600 --> 39:07.360]  YouTube, back when I was still able to talk to one of their vice presidents, they partnered with
[39:07.360 --> 39:11.280]  us a few years ago and when we're in contact with us, but he got moved somewhere else and
[39:11.280 --> 39:16.320]  doesn't talk to us anymore. But he was the number two guy at YouTube. We talked to him many times,
[39:18.720 --> 39:23.280]  said that they were able to look at all the numbers. And it was, this is like five years ago,
[39:23.280 --> 39:30.160]  five plus billion political views. That's the biggest political channel on YouTube because
[39:30.160 --> 39:37.440]  I let everybody post our videos. So they want to shut down and Facebook, Google, Twitter
[39:39.360 --> 39:46.640]  is all announcing together this week that they're going to start censoring us more because they're
[39:46.640 --> 39:50.000]  moving against Trump. They're moving against the Make America Great agenda. They're moving
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.480]  against this reestablishing sovereignty, reestablishing borders, cutting taxes for the middle
[39:54.480 --> 39:58.640]  class, bringing back the hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate taxes that the big
[39:58.640 --> 40:04.400]  corporations lobbied to make it prohibitive to have corporations here domestically to move
[40:04.400 --> 40:11.040]  our jobs overseas. That's what globalism is, is teaching Americans to sit out and shut up
[40:11.040 --> 40:16.960]  via economic warfare, bringing us to heal. Remember, Hillary said blacks are super predators,
[40:16.960 --> 40:20.800]  they've got to be brought to heal. Well, that's just her view of everybody.
[40:20.800 --> 40:27.120]  You read the WikiLeaks, it's all about keeping their constituents down, keeping them poor,
[40:27.120 --> 40:31.680]  keeping them desperate, keep them in the dark and calls you basement dwellers.
[40:34.400 --> 40:41.280]  She says you live with your parents and she says you're baristas who want everything free
[40:41.280 --> 40:48.240]  and that she's not going to give it to you because it isn't there. But she'll still tell you it's there
[40:50.320 --> 40:57.040]  and then you get mad at her when she doesn't deliver it to you. It's only there for her.
[40:58.800 --> 41:07.040]  So you go to Bernie and you say give us all the free money. He says I'll do that. Yeah,
[41:07.040 --> 41:13.680]  just like his wife took over disabled shelters and threw everybody out on the street and sold
[41:13.680 --> 41:19.520]  it just like she took over colleges and bankrupted it. But not before she got millions of dollars
[41:19.520 --> 41:25.360]  for herself and her friends. These are pigs just like Venezuela, just like North Korea.
[41:25.360 --> 41:30.320]  You think Kim Jong-un is going to give you some free stuff? See, once they get control, they go,
[41:30.320 --> 41:35.840]  hey, I'll give you something free, free forced labor till you starve to death. Now worship me
[41:35.840 --> 41:43.600]  or you don't get any food. The problem is just a little bit of free market creates so many choices,
[41:44.160 --> 41:47.680]  so much decadence that we turn into retarded slobs.
[41:53.360 --> 41:59.680]  I don't know a liberal poverty pimp that didn't run in bank scams and didn't rip it off poor people
[41:59.680 --> 42:05.840]  and imagining, you know, managing a big group of helpless people under their control. That's what
[42:05.840 --> 42:13.760]  these vampires do. Bernie Sanders never worked a stinking day in his life. He's a big evil shyster
[42:15.120 --> 42:24.640]  and he knows it and he hates you, but you don't care. You want to get suckered one more time,
[42:24.640 --> 42:31.920]  don't you? Libertarians and conservatives on average pay three times what anybody else pays,
[42:32.480 --> 42:39.360]  where six times weren't likely to give to charity and nine times less likely to steal
[42:43.440 --> 42:49.040]  and give tips on average four times the size of a Democrat or a liberal. Don't believe me,
[42:49.040 --> 42:55.520]  university studies are replete. Democrats don't give tips. Democrats don't pay good wages. You
[42:55.520 --> 43:03.040]  get to be interns. You never get anything because that's how they want to keep you
[43:04.320 --> 43:10.320]  because they ran the plantations, they ran the KKK, they ran the sharecropping and they run you
[43:10.320 --> 43:17.280]  real good and they got the Republican blue blood scumbags, the psychopaths that are just as bad or
[43:17.280 --> 43:23.520]  worse and they're working with them to screw you over. It's a big club to quote George Carlin and
[43:23.520 --> 43:30.400]  we ain't in it. The American club is about trying to set something up where it's not about what
[43:30.400 --> 43:35.360]  elite you're from or how you manage a government contract or how you get a monopoly but what you
[43:35.360 --> 43:44.160]  really produce and then that raises the bar and everybody starts excelling. Best thing
[43:44.160 --> 43:50.960]  ever happened to me was growing up in Dallas and having quite a few rough scrapes. I looked back
[43:50.960 --> 43:57.920]  on that and it was so formative, so good, so wonderful. Now I almost died a few times but
[43:57.920 --> 44:10.080]  that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger. As Victor Hugo said, adversity makes men,
[44:10.080 --> 44:17.200]  prosperity makes monsters and you've got these nihilistic people that have no idea what they're
[44:17.200 --> 44:22.240]  even dealing with. We're going to play something very special that Darren McBrain and Walker put
[44:22.240 --> 44:32.960]  together, one of our great graphics people, Walker, that takes that video from last week that now it's
[44:32.960 --> 44:38.400]  got like 20 million views and it's been written about hundreds of newspapers that has sent us a
[44:38.400 --> 44:43.040]  whole new fan base of young people kind of breaking into the whole Pewdiepie sphere.
[44:46.960 --> 44:52.560]  We put together a version where everything I say is documented with video clips, news articles,
[44:53.600 --> 44:59.440]  except for one thing McBrain forgot to put in which is fine. I say they want to eat babies and I have
[44:59.440 --> 45:05.040]  mainstream news, Daily Mail, Associated Press, China taking dead babies they kill that are one child,
[45:05.040 --> 45:10.400]  they have a girl, they drown the baby and they turn them into powder and then it's injected
[45:10.400 --> 45:15.200]  into women's lips as collagen, into women's faces, into women's butts, men's faces butts,
[45:15.200 --> 45:24.800]  it's a lot of metrosexual men and things now. And we didn't put an article up there about
[45:25.520 --> 45:32.000]  baby parts wrapped in gold foil out of China caught going into Europe or children, children
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.200]  or one child in China turned into collagen. We didn't show that, that's the one thing in
[45:37.200 --> 45:47.760]  retrospect in hindsight that we didn't add but so I'm just as a proviso or a epilogue just adding
[45:47.760 --> 45:52.640]  that that too, there it is, thousands of pills filled with powdered human baby flesh discovered
[45:52.640 --> 45:59.200]  by customs officials in South Korea coming out of China that that's just one article. So here
[45:59.200 --> 46:05.440]  for radio listeners to share the song you go to infowars.com forward slash show or later it'll be
[46:05.440 --> 46:10.480]  archived it's up on infowars.com the video itself right now where we took the super deluxe time
[46:10.480 --> 46:15.520]  warner kit piece that's been seen 20 million times now biggest hit they've ever had on super deluxe
[46:15.520 --> 46:20.960]  their other biggest videos just have a million views or so 20 million on their platforms last
[46:20.960 --> 46:27.200]  time I checked 20 million as of Friday last week when it went up at 9am so we're about
[46:27.200 --> 46:34.640]  seven days and a few hours into this 20 million top video on the internet last weekend and we've
[46:34.640 --> 46:40.080]  now taken it and we added documentation to the whole thing it's a very important information
[46:40.080 --> 46:44.800]  warfare weapon it's on infowars.com please post it on facebook please retweet it get around the
[46:44.800 --> 46:50.960]  sensors copy it to your channel because they're moving to shut down our channel then I intend to
[46:50.960 --> 46:54.960]  unfortunately have to file suit against google the parent company but just has to be done and the
[46:54.960 --> 47:00.160]  groups involved calling for censorship we know they are from leakers uh but uh so get this video
[47:00.160 --> 47:26.160]  copied while it's still up here it is
[47:30.160 --> 47:36.160]  in the run around screaming we love satan we want to eat babies

[48:16.240 --> 48:21.360]  the radio who apparently trumps on the show frequently he said me and hillary are demons

[48:28.080 --> 48:43.360]  ever people are telling me she smells who could not notice someone who smelled that bad
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.360]  ah

[49:46.080 --> 49:51.920]  balance channel going donald trump really stepped in at this time he said it was a bombing before
[49:51.920 --> 49:57.280]  it had officially been called a bombing and hillary's on him and she's got some really good points
[49:59.360 --> 50:05.040]  all right there you go that video's up on info wars dot com extremely powerful when we add everything

[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.560]  just six percent of americans say the russian collusion conspiracy theory is important the
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.320]  daily wire pointed out that in a bloomberg survey pulling americans on what they feel is the most
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:13.920]  important issues concerning the trump administration 35 said health care 13 said the economy 11 said
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.760]  terrorism and immediately six percent said president trump's relationship with russia was
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.920]  an important issue for them then why does the mainstream media spend so much time focusing
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.000]  on the russia conspiracy theory simple they want to undermine the trump presidency to appease their
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.560]  bosses the globalist owners of major news corporations you see the best forms of propaganda
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.560]  spread through deception in the mainstream media role plays as objective journalists while pushing a
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.880]  globalist agenda don't take it from me just look at the bloomberg article that accompanied the poll
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:43.360]  americans feel good about the economy not so good about trump the headline read no really the top
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:47.040]  three issues that americans find important are the top issues that president trump ran on during
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.280]  his campaign the mainstream media hates trump for bringing back americana in the belief in
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.880]  national self-determination and that's why they keep pushing the russian collusion conspiracy
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.680]  theory which cnn's van jones even admitted was a nothing burger this is kit daniels with info wars
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:05.120]  dot com as most of you already know i am a voracious consumer of news and information
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.160]  and in the last four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:16.160]  elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:22.400]  better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:28.400]  they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:35.760]  concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.880]  and supercharging the body at the same time info wars isn't just fighting the globalist

[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:45.360]  whether it's the economist magazine or the harvard magazine they all say globalism is
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:50.240]  collapsing people are turning against it we're not turning against internationalism or being a
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.240]  citizen of the world if you want to live all over the world or working with other countries or

[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:12.320]  by carbon taxes that bureaucrats and Rothschild and rockefellers and soroses make money from
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.360]  story out today future globalism shaken up by trump victory nationalist political earthquakes
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:24.320]  it doesn't mean bricks it's perfect it doesn't mean trumpism is perfect it means it's about
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:30.960]  taking the power back to the people back to the states back to the government bigger politically
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:37.440]  is always worse always more authoritarian and stephan malinu is a businessman author researcher

[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:06.240]  sources as we told you that signifies the populist or even stronger now mascara moochie coming in
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:10.320]  they're getting ready to clean house trump's putting this communication guy in first with the
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:16.320]  rollout he knows deep states coming after him it's on so we'll get malinu's take on that five more
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:23.360]  years of eu migration cabinet victory after agreeing soft landing transition period that will delay
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:30.560]  uk getting its borders back as the eu announces 10 million muslims have come in the last six years
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.440]  worse than i thought most of military age man this is the globalist takedown now they've
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:42.320]  announced an eu navy and and the italian government's blocking citizen groups just going on and
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.440]  showing how the islamists has come out a hundred miles off the coast they get picked up and taken
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:53.760]  to italy and then everything's paid for this is a plan to force islamify europe i didn't
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.480]  believe this 10 years ago when i heard it from people it's really happening it's so insane but
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:03.920]  peter southern admits it's the plan so we'll talk about that as well and other big subjects here
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:09.600]  with stefan malinus stefan thanks for coming on thanks and it's great to be back which one of those
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.360]  two biggies you want to tackle first well i would like to talk about the globalism thing as a whole
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.920]  because i think there's this massive change that is occurring wherein i think the trump
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.480]  administration has figured out that it is not the mainstream media that is going to be setting the
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.320]  agenda and determining the popularity of the candidates and their sort of voter-facing people
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.400]  i think that they're recognizing that the alternative media is where the real action is and
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:38.720]  where the real mind shaping is going on because people come to people like you and i because
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.360]  they get something different than the verbal diarrhea of the mainstream media and so i think
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.480]  that there's a reorientation spicer was big on regime change in syria he was hammered by myself
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:53.920]  and other channels and he's out and scaramucci is in now we'll see how he does i certainly think he's
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.960]  going to be better than spicer but i wouldn't underestimate how much impact we're having in
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.800]  reshaping this narrative and having people remember that there's something about local
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:09.040]  pride that beats this communist globalist nonsense and that's why they're in free fall panic
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:15.680]  when every week now we have videos with 5 10 million viewers just on info wars one video
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:21.280]  you have videos with millions of viewers routinely always 500 000 600 000 you spend 20 minutes you're
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:26.800]  done 500 000 watch it that's more than the average cnn show they now realize it though
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:33.920]  and this week youtube facebook twitter all launched massive censorship and admitted they are they said
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:38.400]  oh we're doing 10 times worse than last year against conservatives but i'm not really a
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.640]  conservative i'm just a common sense free market guy that doesn't want to live in north korea
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.960]  well here's the thing there is an old principle alex which is that people who spend their time
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.600]  being ostracized people who spend their time in the wilderness people who are out learning to eat
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:59.600]  the stony lichen in the desert they get stronger leaner and meaner and the left has gotten very
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.600]  lazy because they've owned academia they've owned the mainstream media they've owned television
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.360]  they've owned everything that you could conceive of and they've been importing all these immigrants
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.760]  to reliably vote for the left which means they've lost their edge they've lost their strength they've
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.640]  lost their charisma they've lost their capacity to connect with the american public and we really
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.000]  saw that with hillary versus donald trump and because they've gotten lazy and they've lost
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.560]  their charisma they've lost their mojo now all they can do is scream russia over and over again
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.480]  and think that that somehow is going to win the american public back when what it's doing is just
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:38.320]  driving them further and further away as the old saying goes let us never ever interrupt an enemy
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.640]  when he's in the process of making a mistake that's my next question i want to get back into
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:49.120]  globalism sure there's a intellectual awakening happening back to common sense but they are in
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:54.160]  cornered rats so what are you concerned about what do you think their next move will be
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:00.960]  oh yeah well their next move is always escalation their next move is always too and then you can
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:05.760]  look at this as far back as the french revolution and so on but their next move is always to spread
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:12.320]  lies rumor and slander in an attempt to discredit people who disagree with their narrative but
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:19.120]  more importantly to whip up frenzy hatred and violence against those who oppose the leftist
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:25.200]  paradigm the leftist is fantastic at being the iago like whisperers of sinister facts to the mob
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:30.000]  to the point where crazy elements within the mob start to play out a very violent and dangerous
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.600]  agenda and we can see this happening against trump supporters at the moment sure hashtag
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:39.040]  hunt republicans hashtag republicans and you're right they are escalating that so where is it going
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.240]  well i mean either they're going to succeed or they're going to fail and i'm damned if i'm
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.400]  going to stand by and let them succeed because i like yourself i'm a father and i want my child
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:54.400]  to grow up with the kind of freedoms that i enjoyed maybe even more so we just have to stand firm we
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.440]  have to be courageous and we have to have to have to recognize that we are in a war for civilization
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.320]  nothing more nothing less this is the greatest battle for wordsmiths in the history of the
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.760]  universe we're not at the place where it's bullets and bombs we're at the place where it's words
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:12.160]  and ideas and arguments so if you're good at doing that or even if you want to become good at that
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:19.040]  you are conscripted philosophy reason evident want you to take your place in the front lines
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.480]  of the culture now or never i think that's the most important thing you've ever said i mean this
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.280]  is the 21st century war this is the new kind of war they're admitting it's a war they're admitting
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:36.160]  it's a civil war and there was quote right wing problems decades ago and still the establishment
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.360]  right wing is just as bad as the liberals but intellectually the resistance is by the libertarian
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.760]  mind versus the status mind and most the classic liberals are now libertarians and they recognize
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:54.560]  that but there's an accelerated dumbing down of the constituency that is pro-globalism where i go
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:00.400]  out to these events and it's not like a few of them look like they escape from mental hospital the
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:07.040]  entire whole of them are frothing insane people out of some type of day of the dead movie and i
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:13.040]  don't take pleasure in that i am frightened by it who are these people well this is the constituent
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.640]  that has been bred to be dependent on the bloody fruits of state power the state reaches into the
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.720]  pockets of the productive as you know keeps a good portion of proceeds for themselves and then
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:28.000]  uses it to buy votes and dependence from now a couple of generations of people dependent on state
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.200]  power so when someone comes along and says we need to limit and control and reduce the size and power
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.800]  of the state people think that they're gonna starve to death that they're gonna die in the gutter
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.440]  they have become dependent on the state to the point they can't imagine living without state power
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:47.040]  now they can they can when welfare or food stamps get reduced people just shrug and get a job but
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:52.000]  that fear that hump we need to help them over that hump and help them understand how much better
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.560]  they'll be off without this dependence on state power how they'll have pride and productivity
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:01.600]  and self-respect and happiness which they're not having right now but like every addict if you
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.280]  try and take away their drugs they know in their heads they're going to be better off if it's taken
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.280]  away but in their hearts and in their guts they desperately don't want to lose it and we just have
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.480]  to help them overcome that fear overcome that hump and sell them on the happiness they'll have when
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.960]  they're free for the first time in their lives i want to be specific if you raise the fact that
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:24.240]  you're a father i'm a father i'm not bad for people that don't have children i'm a lot of great
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.320]  friends that don't understand sometimes you know why they don't or you know what's or issues whatever
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:35.040]  the case may be but no one it turns out the EU government has hits i mean it's the craziest
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:39.520]  thing we've ever seen almost none of the leaders do and when you look at a group of hundreds of
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:45.440]  people and then none of them have children you sit back and you go wow these are the most self-centered
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.080]  people and it really is that the dichotomy is people that have a connection to everything
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:56.320]  and really think of humanity as a continuum and people that literally are so nihilistic all
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:01.520]  they're thinking about is themselves and i think that's really the disconnect well you have to
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.360]  understand that you're part of a chain of freedom you know one of the worst things to happen to
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.640]  modern economics was this keensianism idea from john meanard keens who was gay and didn't have kids
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.880]  and he basically said oh yeah you just got to spend your way out of recessions oh and don't
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.120]  worry the government will then save when there's economic growth and of course all that was was
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:23.600]  it gave theoretical justification for the endless printing of money the endless borrowing of money
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.160]  the endless bribery of the general population and people said well you're going to keep accumulating
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.720]  debts they said this to two maynard keens you're going to keep accumulating debts keep accumulating
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.200]  debts what's going to happen in the long run and apparently he turned and snapped back and said
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:43.920]  in the long run we're all dead well if you have kids that's not how you think because you know
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.040]  that your kids are going to be alive your kids are going to have to live in the world that your
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:52.320]  ideas are creating or destroying and so you want to fight for their freedoms it gives you a ferocity
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.600]  around the encroachment of state power that i think it's hard to replicate otherwise
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:03.600]  you're right we're going to come back with a final segment here in a moment and and get into
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.040]  the political wars but my view is even if they end up destroying trump which i don't think is going
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:12.240]  to happen we've already had devastating victories just against political correctness showing that
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:17.600]  we have unelected systems i mean just this movement and trump is being a focal point of that i think
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:23.040]  really has wrecked the crony capitalist model i mean it's still in place but it has no credibility
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:29.760]  and the power is draining out of it daily and they have become lazier and lazier as i mentioned
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:35.280]  and wait what we need to remember is we have to think what would the left do if they had power
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:39.680]  and we got countless examples of this throughout history and hillary clinton promised this she
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:43.280]  promised that she was going to consider any made-up cyber attack from russia to be the
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.200]  provocation for world war three she was going to go after freedom of speech she was going to
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:53.600]  import millions of uh state-loving mass immigrants from the third world so what are they going to do
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.600]  when they have power when they have a little bit of power they ran through obama care we have to be

[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.400]  Stefan Malinuh
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:17.760]  has really great historical analysis on his website on his YouTube as well and I found
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:23.120]  he's one of the people that is effectively getting liberals who actually are somewhat intellectual to
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:28.480]  realize they're in a cult because they always go oh you're just a republican I hate Paul Ryan I
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:33.200]  hate neocons I hate all these people Trump's actually trying to end the al-Qaeda forces
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.520]  that Obama and Hillary created he's actually trying to have peace with Russia and they're
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.480]  demonizing and they're coming after him and I just wish we could actually reach out to the
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:48.880]  peaceniks and somehow get them to realize this is all a fraud even Alan Dershowitz and even
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:54.160]  Jonathan Turley who are classic liberal lawyers say this whole thing and Trump's a total
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.800]  witch hunt and it's so dangerous because the Democrats have said they're not going to stop
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:04.240]  with this they're talking about civil emergency overturning the whole elections and then coming
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:10.800]  after everybody so the stakes have never been higher Stefan Malinuh looking at that I mean I
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:16.480]  I don't know how to state the level of history we are at right now I mean I cannot overstate that
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:23.280]  to folks that we are at such an epic moment it will never ever in human history come down to
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:28.720]  as important a moment Alex and I really want to get this across to your listeners if the state wins
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:34.240]  if the globalist win if the communists and the socialist win capitalism has delivered unto them
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:40.560]  such monitoring and control and video technology that it is entirely possible we will never ever
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:46.000]  be free again it comes down to this we have the technology to communicate free and peaceful and
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.120]  voluntary ideas across the world they have the technology to control everything we do to monitor
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.120]  everything we do they're talking about bringing you monitoring of the internet in in the UK and so
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:00.400]  on if we lose we may never ever win again there won't be some big cycle of history and your great
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:05.600]  can't grandkids will be free it comes down to now they would use every tool in their arsenal
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:11.280]  to win and they're trying it we must use every legal tool in our arsenal to fight back take no
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:17.280]  prisoners push forward every agenda challenge every relationship push forward because it's now
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:24.880]  literally or never I strongly believe I'm speechless that is 100 percent total veritas
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.200]  they even brag they call it the end of history where they're going to use all the technology
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:35.280]  to suppress the normal turning the normal cycles to end renaissance consolidate total control
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.880]  Schmidt and Zuckerberg all of them as you know Bill Joy warned people he's one of them but he said
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.280]  it's very immoral what they're doing they're going to have a breakaway civilization put us into total
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:51.280]  squalor use it to control us and then use the fruits of the human mind and open society that has
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:59.600]  given us almost godlike powers to shackle us I mean this is this is unspeakably evil what do we do
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.760]  well we recognize that was something like the betrayal of brexit brexit as you know Alex was
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:10.960]  about one thing and one thing only which was controlling immigration and 80 percent of white
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:16.400]  british people wanted control of immigration 60 percent wanted it enormously reduced why because
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.240]  when the immigrants from the third world move into england british people white people have to move
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.400]  out and it never goes the other way it's a one-way street where the places you can even live in
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.640]  england if you're white get smaller and smaller and smaller they voted for it and the elites are
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:34.080]  now saying they are disregarding what it is that people vote for to hell with the will of the people
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.320]  we're going to do what we want and it's going to be six or seven years before we even talk about
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:43.200]  limiting just EU borders and more immigrants came in from non EU countries to the UK than EU
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.440]  countries they've declared war they said the will of the people don't matter it doesn't matter anymore
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:52.320]  what do you do you have to start protesting you have to start getting out there you have to recognize
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:57.440]  that this is an emergency there is no defcon lever level higher than what we are facing right now
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:02.080]  you need to pull out all the stops get all the information you can you have a global communications
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.640]  network you can tap into it anytime you can challenge people in your life it is down to this
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:11.280]  because if we don't solve this peacefully the kind of weapons that we have if it turns to war
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:17.040]  might end the entire planet and the great evil is that they're not trying to reform islam they're
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.920]  taking the most radical orthodox forms they're just totally brutal anti-woman you name it to the
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:28.240]  tenth degree and then using it as their new shock troops and admitting in their own publications
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:35.200]  that they're allied with it this is madness well they have no interest in diversity this is so
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.240]  something so important the left sells diversity so that you will accept people coming into your
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.400]  society that will relentlessly vote for the left they don't care about diversity at all try being
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:50.080]  not on the left and getting a job at a leftist university or a leftist mainstream media outlet
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:55.360]  try being a non-leftist and writing for television they have no interest you who have the stats
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:01.360]  96 percent of voters of washington reporters donated to the to the hillary clinton campaign
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:06.000]  they have no interest in diversity whatsoever diversity for means for them shut up people
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.560]  who aren't on the left shut up white people and accept your subjugation while i say no
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:16.080]  to that end to the lie of diversity and they're not helping they're not helping the quote brown
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:21.440]  people by blowing up free market and blowing up christian civilization that brought everybody in
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:25.520]  there again the globalists are in competition leftists used to care about the poor and they used
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.240]  to care about the working class mass immigration drives down the wages of the poor in america and
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:36.080]  it doesn't help the migrants it drives them down too we've got to build up through free market
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:41.680]  through free market globalism those countries through free association wow stefan malin who

[01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:04.720]  radio network do you remember denise haster the longest-serving republican speaker of the house
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:10.000]  in history also the highest-ranking u.s politician to be sent to prison has to was a small town
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.560]  wrestling coach in illinois when he was what judge thomas durkin of the federal court described as a
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.080]  serial child molester because of the statutes of limitations for acts in the 1960s and 70s has
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:25.280]  run out hastert was not charged for any of the sexual abuse he engaged in if you can believe that
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:31.600]  he did go down for legal hush money to the tune of at least 3.5 million dollars he was fined 250
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:38.320]  thousand dollars and sentenced to 15 months in prison hardly justice but now the serial child
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:44.640]  molester is free once again after serving only 13 months judge durkin also said there's nothing
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:49.520]  more disturbing than having a child molester and speaker of the house in the same sentence i
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:54.320]  disagree there's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only one

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.440]  a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:24.160]  filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:30.240]  silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:36.880]  that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death i personally

[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:26.720]  it on over a little dog calls the big dogs moving in she's changed the lock on our front door
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:37.280]  and my door he don't fit no more so get it on over john spicer and on over a skinny dog calls the fat
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:45.760]  dogs moving in that's right this dog house here is mighty small but his country was on death watch
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:51.200]  when trump got elected his rhetoric i knew was devastating i'm just that rhetoric alone reintroduced
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:57.280]  nationalism common sense free market anti-globalism i said well that's positive but if he goes
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:03.680]  sideways i'll expose him i mean that's what i'm used to doing i'm ready to attack default
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.800]  you're a globalist you're selling people out trump has done way better than i thought he could do
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.080]  but they're coming after him even harder than i thought they would now we learn obama was ready
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:19.680]  for marshal law and election day that's new york post they're looking at cog and having a civil
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:26.400]  emergency to remove him and saying it on cnn now and msnbc they're getting ready to go operational
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:33.840]  and they got muting there over there 98 percent of his money going to democrats everybody on
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:40.640]  there except him appointed by bush just as bad as democrats everybody on there pointed by democrats
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.920]  brought on our democrats i mean this is incredible we're talking roger stone about what this means
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:50.080]  he popped in earlier with us but he's got more intel now we had him on three minutes after the
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:56.160]  spicer resignation was brought out little birds told me months ago that if spicer left that it
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:05.680]  would be previous and that would trigger basically a palace coup by the patriots uh and that uh into
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:10.160]  that vacuum folks like bannon will really be able to get even more done but already trump
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:15.040]  just totally sinks with bannon because trump is a patriot before bannon was you know fighting
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:19.600]  the globalists 30 years ago trump was fighting nafta and gat and all the rest of it so this
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:26.720]  is a big day this is a big deal and and and and muller moving is forcing trump to move
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:32.320]  i mean the crimes of hillary are legion and confirmed and just left alone
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:38.480]  trump's done nothing so now they're got a biggest fishing expedition of any president ever
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:45.040]  against him all of his associates all of his campaign people all their finances hell they
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:51.040]  admit i'm in the dragnet let's go let's get these opinions going let's go i've been a
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:56.560]  testified public though i'm not testifying secret with congress we have a man joining us who did
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:03.680]  testify in congress coming up uh in the next hour stone arrived shot down with a little bit
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:10.560]  to introduce michael caputo they had him testify on secret then lied about what he said and won't
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:18.080]  release a transcript that was the trap they had for stone but they knew stone was gonna get the
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:24.640]  information out one way or the other and so they chickened out last week and brought in caputo
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:31.920]  so that's coming up caputo sent by the cia into russia to keep yeltsin in power and
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.960]  they use that file on him to claim he's a russian agent with no evidence that's who these people are
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:41.600]  ladies and gentlemen we're dealing with so it's a war within the deep state make no mistake now

[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:03.920]  say his name who his wife left him over Trump I mean I'm not complaining but this is like the

[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:12.640]  sit here and lose this fight we're starting to turn the tide but we need your prayers

[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:32.560]  everything's copyright free use it I just want to reach people that's why I never monetize the
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:38.720]  YouTube channels even though the vice president of YouTube came to me six years ago and said listen
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.240]  you got five billion views but only a billion of them are on your channels at that time it's much
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:47.040]  bigger now this would be you know millions and millions of dollars a year he said we think it'll
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:53.440]  be three four million a year if you just let us monetize with bots everybody and I said I'm sorry
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:58.320]  I'd rather have four billion extra views than have three million dollars or four million dollars
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:03.920]  and I'm not complaining oh I don't have money I mean that that's money doesn't come first here
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:09.040]  money is energy once you got a decent house and medical care and decent cars and some clothes
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.400]  and I've been wearing the same two blue sports jackets for five years they're getting holes in

[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:42.880]  crazy you bet I am I know what you are I know what I'm up against God's gonna give me whatever
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.360]  energy or will I need to destroy you so the stronger you get the stronger I get and you

[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:56.960]  scum you're gonna pay for everything you've done now Roger so let me settle down give you the floor
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:02.160]  for this segment please cover the waterfront my friend of what this means today would spice
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:05.440]  her leaving and the latest info you have so she joined us one hour ago
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:14.000]  is Roger there called yes the kind like the last time the president of the United States called
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:24.160]  you I'm walking through TSA you're gonna have to give me a minute okay so that's what happened
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:30.160]  yeah one time Trump called me when I was going to the TSA ridiculous I literally said to the
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.840]  TSA excuse me it's the president and they all knew who I was they said yes sir so I just stood there
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:43.280]  in the TSA line by the scanners and talk to the president that's another thing where you don't
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:46.320]  want to be uppity you don't want to be a celebrity don't want to be powerful because I don't care
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:50.240]  about all that crap I'm not a narcissistic person it's about what the you know media says and all
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:56.240]  the rest of it I'm confident and bold so people miss to screw what it is but it is kind of fun to
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:01.280]  say sorry I'm talking to the president right now and then they know who you are believe it go yes sir
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:10.000]  it's just bizarre um he's going through the line right now Roger's working double time today
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.200]  okay we'll we'll go back to Roger here in just a minute let me play a clip here that lays it all
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:20.720]  out I want to play Newt Gennrich again Newt Gennrich Mueller's law firm gave 99.81 percent
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:26.960]  see I knew I was saying 98 and something told me that was wrong the that Democrats get 98 plus
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:33.680]  percent 98.6 percent or the federal elections commissions of the 2016 election they give 98.6
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:41.840]  percent to Democrats I'm sorry I misspoke earlier Mueller's law firm gave 99.81 and then that's true
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:50.720]  according to the federal election commission 99.81 99.81 look here's that clip
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:59.600]  the Mueller investigation has so many conflicts of interest uh it's almost an absurdity
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:09.760]  the law firm he comes from gave 99.81 percent of his donations to Hillary Clinton last year
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:18.240]  that's right 0.19 of 1% went to Donald Trump the people that he's been hiring are all anti-Trump
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:24.800]  lawyers uh several of them have very bad records of hiding information from the defense and one
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:30.800]  case was rebuked full clip on info wars.com Roger Stone at the airport Roger please continue
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.640]  since we talked an hour ago I know you we talked to you just minutes after the news was announced
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:45.040]  of Spicer what's the latest intel? Well Alex it's a I think one of the most momentous weeks of the
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:53.280]  Trump presidency not only did the president essentially express a lack of confidence in
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:57.600]  Jeff Sessions but we have evidence of a White House shakeup that's been long
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.240]  in the works uh I just think that we're about to have a sea change
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:10.720]  and what do you expect dealing the players that sea change will bring about
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:15.440]  okay
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.840]  again Roger Stone joins us from the airport have you gotten any more intel since we talked an hour
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:30.800]  ago? The wonders of cell phones not working too well right now while we get him back because I
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:35.600]  know he's got breaking news let's let's reconnect with him have him do the trick where he flips his
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:41.280]  phone uh to the airplane and back on that usually gets you a better signal he doesn't I don't think
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.280]  understands that trick because you get the complex error with a lot of phones on they'll it'll all
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:49.120]  kind of downgrade you so that everybody gets a little bit of cell and the way to cheat that
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:52.720]  because it is your service not really cheating it the way to get around that is to turn your
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:58.960]  phone on and off or to turn it on the airplane turn it back on I want to play this Mark Dice
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:04.800]  report Trump's been president for six months and now he's made it great again that's coming up
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:13.120]  I want to get some of these other clips on record here's one Austria pork banned from schools
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:19.440]  because Muslims complain you don't see pork getting banned out of schools because Orthodox Jews
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:24.320]  complain and again I don't want to sit here and bash Muslims they're the ones everywhere they go
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:31.680]  that make you comport to them they're the ones that make you go along with their system they're
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.160]  the ones that make you change and here's the deal I'm not doing that for any leftist or any Muslims
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:45.040]  or anybody else understand so here is the clip parents in Austria have got beef with the authorities
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:52.080]  after pork was given the chop from kindergarten it's been missing from menus for five years
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:59.040]  but now it's been spotted Austrians are in a stew over it the authorities claim children simply
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:04.880]  prefer chicken and carrots the ditch was dropped due to health reasons among other things the needs
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:10.960]  of Muslim children but there's one line that's left a non-sweet all sour taste in parents mouths
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:18.240]  and those polls say they now strongly oppose the decision despite the mayor's claim there's been no
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:25.120]  official decree is still new some are finding difficult to digest I cannot really see a reason
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:35.680]  why the mayor of Salzburg is denying Austrian children access to normal Austrian pork dishes
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:41.200]  pork dishes are part of our culture if somebody wants to live here actually they should respect
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:48.320]  our culture there's the one side who thinks we should pursue a kind of a peaceman strategy
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:56.000]  to accommodate Muslims in Europe and to make sure that they feel like at home and others who think
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.120]  wait wait a minute this is Europe this is our country these are our countries we are not Muslims
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:07.520]  we want to keep our identity so this is part of a major political conflict there is an
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:16.160]  the strategy of the Muslims is to call any criticism on them islamophobia and now especially
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:23.280]  left-wing politicians are almost very much afraid of of being called islamophobic you know it's
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:31.840]  crazy Vienna is known for its pork dishes in fact that's where you get some of the names for pork
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:38.080]  dishes is after the name of the city Vienna I guess Vienna means wine country and its definition
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:43.920]  but if you look at uh venus nuts and things that means from Vienna hammered pork hammered beef and
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.720]  lightly breaded uh this is how it works and here in the U.S. they're taking pork off menus
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:57.520]  in Illinois and in some areas of Michigan areas of New York everybody's got to bend over backwards
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:05.280]  for the Muslims and then we get to have Linda Sorcer lecturing us constantly stones going
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.520]  through TSA well we'll we'll get the latest info from him or he'll come on later with us
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:16.400]  uh he's about to go on an airplane and we also have his uh friend coming on who is
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.360]  who is in the trump campaign and then just testified in congress secretly
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:26.320]  then they demonize even a lot about him he's going to be joining us uh coming up in the next hour
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:31.680]  and then mark dice also be joining us but uh michael caputo is going to be coming up as well
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:37.280]  and i've got a ton of news i haven't even gotten to yet positive thinking to extend your lifespan
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:42.720]  just believing you're healthy cuts your risk early death by 71 that you watch all the tv ads

[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:50.960]  blah blah blah and it actually is increasing that's why i'm exposing that they're pushing it

[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:05.360]  tonight on the nightly news the stock market started going down yesterday after six months
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.640]  going up of course started going up as soon as trump got elected so i guess eight months of it going
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.320]  up to its highest level ever and hundreds of billions of new jobs thousands of companies
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:23.520]  coming back to the united states 69 reduction any legals coming across the border massive

[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:52.080]  but see time magazine the establishment said she's madam president
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.120]  and they don't lie she's our president at least according to them still
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:04.880]  they were supposed to use this whole woman thing like we're going to get rid of free
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:07.680]  market we're going to bankrupt you and your family we're going to take your guns we're going to get
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:13.920]  rid of our borders but it's okay because mommy's in charge now big mommy the merkle model the
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:21.280]  deutschland model but now Mueller comes out says i'm doing a fishing expedition to all his finances
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:26.240]  all his family all his associates at all of his campaign i'm going to see if russians ever bought
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:30.480]  a condo from him oh that'll oh my gosh i bet a lot of russians bought out of their hundreds of
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.920]  properties oh my goodness and the stock market started going down yesterday and today in the
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:41.120]  fellow reserve announced we're going to increase interest rates even more because the economy's
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:47.760]  growing too fast when it's sputtering there they are there's muller and there's janet yelling oh
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:52.720]  there's a recovery in the crib it might get on its feet here let's take a pillow and put it over
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:59.680]  baby's face but trump's little strong little baby he's kind of fighting the pillow often
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:07.680]  snorting some air down and they're like oh we better slit his throat after all we're big mega
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:12.800]  banks we're liberal we're apple and others that make our slave goods in china at factories
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:18.480]  with suicide nets everything's liberal so the stock market's going down now because this
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.040]  Mueller thing this is unprecedented roger what does trump need to do right now to Mueller i mean
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:27.360]  the guy is completely doing the biggest fishing expedition ever what does trump do
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:34.400]  yeah we should first fire rod rosin state the deputy attorney general who gave us
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:40.000]  Miller upon his own authority with direction from no one and then he should fire newler
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:46.800]  and challenge all comers at that point uh to and to and if they think they have ground which they
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:54.640]  don't uh this is a benign tumor this is a kind bomb in which the fuse has already been led
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:58:00.320]  that Mueller will find some focus charge against the president uh in the hopes that they will
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:06.240]  win the house in 18 and therefore have the votes to impeach and they admit that's their plan
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:14.720]  yes pretty much i mean they have yet to find a crime so they're going to seek to manufacture one
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:20.320]  now looking into the finances of the president and his family prior to the time he was candidate
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:26.160]  for president i don't want authority it just shows you um the desperateness of the ruling
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:32.480]  clique and the neil ponds to remove trump before he god knows makes america great again stay there

[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:56.080]  we got five more minutes left with roger stone then his associate another evil patriot that
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:01.200]  helped bring the country back from the brink of destruction who just testified secretly in congress
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:05.840]  last week will be joining us in fact we may just keep him on a little bit with us he's now telling
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:11.760]  us via text message so that he can help me interview caputo but continue i mean this is
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:17.600]  obviously trump gearing up realizing that the fuse has been lit on this metastasizing cancer
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:23.040]  how long does he have well i'll first of all let me apologize to the listeners and this
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:28.720]  reminds me of one president called you when you were trying to go through tsa at the airport and
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:35.520]  there's nothing so officious as a canadian with a badge so i apologize for that disjointed nature
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:41.040]  of this but i've got a few minutes here and i really think we're reaching a crucial point here
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:47.600]  where meuller and rosenstein has to be discharged this is a lingering malignant cancer as i said
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:53.360]  earlier uh the president has a support i believe among the american people right now everybody's
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:02:00.240]  ignoring in the rising economy uh and the other leading indicators that show that america is on
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:05.840]  its way back they don't report it but i think the american people are beginning to feel it i think
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:13.120]  the president's never never been stronger uh and this was a plot by rosenstein this was their fail
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:19.600]  safe they want to do nothing short of reversing the results of the 2016 elections what they could
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:26.800]  not accomplish at the ballot box they now want to accomplish by fiat and they now admit that what do
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:31.760]  you make of the new york post reporting that obama had a martial law plan for after the election at
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:38.800]  the military standing by to basically take over the state houses you know many patriots said this
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:45.520]  before the election and many of those were people who were well connected sources of info wars i had
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:53.680]  a tendency to discount it at the time but i was completely wrong the the arrogance uh the extensive
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:03:01.360]  entitlement uh of the of the neocon left is beyond but anything i've ever seen they were going to save
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:07.280]  the country by declaring martial law and suspending all the constitution and all our civil liberties
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:12.720]  just in case dildo Trump won but they choked at the most that they did choke but that's because
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:17.280]  his win had to be so overwhelming look at it this way as you pointed out earlier on program
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:24.400]  we just have the tip of the edge of the massive voter fraud that went on if you calculate that
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:29.200]  into the election returns you will begin to realize that trump won so overwhelmingly
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:35.440]  that they could not steal it it was such a mega such a mega landslide and hillary reportedly
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:39.600]  now confirm collapsed that night and their own people just said this is too crazy this woman's
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:44.320]  insane the the pentagon was going to fight him on it and and and so they back down now they're
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:50.560]  trying to reorganize it's not going to work i think that's exactly right and we know that they
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:59.040]  began pushing the phony russian collusion delusion within 48 hours of the election uh the archcriminal
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:05.520]  john podesta bad news for him yesterday the the russian company associated with putin that gave
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:12.960]  him 75 000 very valuable shares shares he didn't disclose and his required financial disclosures
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:20.080]  with the us government has collapsed and they say trump was in bed with the russians no it was
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:27.120]  podesta illery bill chelsea tony podesta in bed with the russians their phony narrative is collapsing
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:35.120]  before our very eye it's just wild we're going to go to break uh we're going to introduce a
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:39.360]  gentleman who was where you were going to be last week testifying they chickened out on you and had
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:45.680]  their secret testimony to only slander our next guest stay with us ladies and gentlemen i'm alex
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:50.960]  jones info wars dot com is our website prison planet dot com's the backup stone cold truth
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:56.960]  dot com is rogers the enemy hates it when you tell people about the website or you spread the link
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:04.080]  it's forbidden fruit just six percent of americans say the russian collusion conspiracy theory is
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:07.920]  important the data wire pointed out that in a bloomberg survey pulling americans on what they
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:11.760]  feel is the most important issues concerning the trump administration 35 percent said health care
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:16.240]  13 percent said the economy 11 percent said terrorism and immediately six percent said president
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:20.480]  trump's relationship with russia was an important issue for them then why does the mainstream media
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:24.720]  spend so much time focusing on the russia conspiracy theory simple they want to undermine the
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:29.680]  trump presidency to appease their bosses the globalist owners of major news corporations you see the
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:33.600]  best forms of propaganda spread through deception in the mainstream media role plays as objective
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:37.520]  journalists while pushing a globalist agenda but don't take it from me just look at the bloomberg
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:41.840]  article that accompanied the poll americans feel good about the economy not so good about trump
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:46.000]  the headline read oh really the top three issues that americans find important are the top issues
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.920]  that president trump ran on during his campaign the mainstream media hates trump for bringing back
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:54.080]  americana in the belief in national self-determination and that's why they keep pushing the russian
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:58.400]  collusion conspiracy theory which cnn's van jones even admitted was a nothing burger this is kit
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:03.840]  daniels with info wars dot com we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:09.360]  with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:14.640]  through mother nature to detoxify the body that's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal and
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:21.120]  chemical defense support it's made in the usa it's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:25.840]  absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war it is a classical
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:31.440]  360 win this is the formula that i personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:36.720]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get you want
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:41.520]  to yourself you want to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that
[02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:47.680]  patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you the
[02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:52.720]  remnant of america to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:56.720]  as you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together we're changing the world now
[02:06:56.720 --> 02:07:02.160]  it's time to change our bodies with z shield and info wars life dot com they use their media to
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:07.280]  assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children that their president is another
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:12.960]  hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:18.640]  narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:25.360]  all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:32.000]  and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:39.280]  the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:45.760]  and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way we stop this the
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:53.040]  only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:08:10.960]  fist of truth i'm the national rifle association of america and i'm freedom's safest place
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:28.080]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's alex joe
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:34.560]  notice the scumbag democratic party in the msm that gave 98 plus percent of its money to the
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:42.160]  democrats in the last election notice that they call themselves the resistance now
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:47.280]  to trump and us no it's the globalist it's the crony capitalist it's a special interest
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.360]  that rhodo obama cared to screw people over and trumps just trying to get rid of it
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:55.760]  they're the ones that wrote the tpp in secret they're the ones that put us in the napkin
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:01.200]  gat one-sided deals and the carbon tax that only we had to pay and trump's saying that's all over
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:06.160]  in our economies come and roar and back so muler comes out with the biggest fishing expedition
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:12.640]  ever ever beyond witchcraft and says everybody trump knows all his associates all his campaign
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:18.080]  people any media affiliated with them we're gonna drag net everything of their financials
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:23.200]  and they said mclatchy including me i have zero to do financially with trump
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:30.800]  but they don't care everybody's a russian agent including michael caputo did a great
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:36.160]  job in the campaign and then who we heard constantly was connected to the russians
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:40.320]  even though i knew months ago when this his name was being thrown around that he worked
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:47.200]  to keep yeltsin in power for the u.s government that wasn't secret info it is secret who obviously
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:54.160]  runs that but it's not now it's got three letters in its name but that shows how keeping yeltsin
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:59.920]  in power he's now a russian agent when that was u.s policy of the clintons so michael caputo
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:04.720]  joins us we've got roger stone at the airport riding shotgun because he's an expert on this
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:08.880]  it was stone and others that told me a long time ago and to the scaramucci they've been
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:14.800]  trying to run him out he goes in his communications director get ready for all the neocons and the
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:20.000]  moles to be taken out and removed spicer just jumped ship notice the new york times had the
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:26.960]  scoop first and the daily beast he was leaking it all to them first the only misjudgment of
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:34.800]  trump was not getting rid of him sooner good lord good lord uh michael caputo uh again testified
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:39.920]  in secret they asked for it stone was going to do it but they cancelled it they won't give him a
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:46.640]  transcript but now they're putting out supposedly what he said and then suddenly not having him back
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:53.840]  on the cable news shows so he can respond so here he is at info wars michael caputo politics ny
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:11:00.960]  dot net thank you so much for joining us hey thanks alex for inviting me i really appreciate it well
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:05.040]  well we appreciate you uh please just tell folks what you need to know about the committee
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:10.320]  and why you're in uh major news publications like the washington post former trump campaign
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:17.360]  consultant warren's president surrogates away from house intel probe i'll tell you i went into
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:23.600]  this thing with my eyes open uh on march 20th representative jackie spear of open california
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:29.680]  brought my name into a live televised open uh the house intelligence committee hearing and also
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:34.480]  brought my wife into this for some reason i still can't figure out you know my wife is ukrainian not
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:39.360]  russian or anybody knows anything about world politics they know that ukrainians aren't if you're
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:44.800]  married to ukraine that is not uh an avenue toward budin no just means you have good taste in women
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:51.120]  that's right well she apparently is not really well apprised i bet she couldn't tell ukraine
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:57.280]  and russia apart on a map but she went out there dragged my wife and so i immediately moved to you
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:03.280]  know i insisted that i want another open hearing on on on television live on television to avenge my
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:07.280]  wife and to set the record straight but they refused to give me an open hearing in fact they're
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:12.720]  refusing to get at any of us an open hearing now not even roger call manaporte or anybody
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:18.960]  and uh so i i decided to cooperate anyway i'm excited to get my you know two cents in to try
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:23.920]  to prove this russian collusion delusion is a false narrative i went in there i actually
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:29.120]  thought it would felt pretty pretty fair i mean the democrats were assertive not aggressive you
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:34.560]  know representative uh shift was not rude to me he treated me like a gentleman i had high hopes for
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:39.920]  the result for this i was fully i fully disclosed that i had absolutely no discussion with any russian
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:44.480]  uh during the campaign that i knew of no discussion with russia we didn't even you know
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:50.400]  speak about russia even once during the entire time i was with the campaign i feel an insult but
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:55.920]  it's also impossible that donald trump would even consider doing such a thing or even allow it in his
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:02.400]  midst or in his around him to kind of put you know trees and he wouldn't allow it so i thought it
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:07.520]  was a solid uh uh meeting and then after when i come out you know jackie spear couldn't be bothered
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:12.960]  to attend in fact only four members attended two democrats and two republicans jackie spear
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:17.280]  couldn't even be bothered to attend but when she got back to washington after having her weekend
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:23.520]  in california she decided to tell cnn that i i may have lied under oath at the committee hearing
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:28.720]  even though there she didn't attend and there still is no transcripts not available to her or to me
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:34.320]  so that speculation is a violation of the confidentiality of this process it's
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:39.760]  certainly a violation of house ethic health excuse me house ethics and i'll tell you even
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:43.680]  though i feel good about this in the beginning my advice to roger stone and everybody else in
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:50.720]  this whole situation is to stay away from a closed hearing because it's really just a rig game well i
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:56.160]  agree and you know i've got your statement printed out here if you've got it you're welcome to read
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:02.160]  it out because again they want to do this in secret uh be back when they had the red scare
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:07.280]  hearings which i think got out of hand some but there were real communist russian soviet agents
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:11.920]  back then and uh 15 years ago the russians declassified a lot of their files and showed that
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:16.800]  mccarthy was pretty much on target uh but i do think he violated some people's rights but
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:24.480]  he did those hearings in public this is so next level cowardly to do it in private keep the transcript
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:29.920]  secret and then let people selectively use the transcript but not give it to you the accused
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:36.240]  while maxine waters everybody runs around insane you know saying quote if you talk to a russian
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:43.280]  you're a russian agent yeah it's amazing just how foolish this has gotten and then i'll tell you
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:48.960]  yesterday uh morning my attorney i sent a letter to the house the permanent select committee on
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.680]  intelligence telling them that we want our my uh transcript release to the public now
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:58.800]  unredacted unclassified we didn't we didn't discuss anything that we thought was classified
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:03.760]  we want that out there so i can have representative jackie spear point to the section where she thinks
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:08.080]  i lied i mean how would she know she wasn't there and there is no transcript so she's
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:14.480]  operating just on her own uh you know uh you know delusions but uh if they don't do it you know i
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:20.640]  can't see how this is could be fair at all listen it's it's entirely possible that uh that the
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:25.360]  representative jackie spear is the fraydo of the house intelligence committee and that all of her
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:29.520]  brothers on the committee are upset about how she's embarrassed the family and they can send her out
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:35.360]  to vegas whatever it takes to get her out of the mix but fraydo has messed this up now and uh even
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:40.720]  though she's a the dullest at you know knife in that door they need to do something to fix it the
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:46.560]  only way to get my reputation back is to reveal that testimony in its entirety and have jackie
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:53.520]  spear point to the section where she thinks i lied it's incredible i mean this is criminal
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:57.840]  in our judicial system and our congressional legislative system if they don't do this i've
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:02.800]  studied our political system and i can't find times where there are closed door sessions and then
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:08.560]  they don't release the transcript to everybody and then accuse someone of lying and then not
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:15.440]  say where you lied it's beyond kovka i i believe i i agree with you but i gotta tell you i think
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:20.720]  even uh uh representative schiff and uh swillwell and howlers uh they probably are pretty upset
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:26.800]  about this because it puts the lie to their entire process if they are trying to uh uh pull a rig game
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:33.840]  and and uh make it look like it's fair and and and and decent on its face like they were to me in
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:39.040]  the hearing she just blew their cover this thing is rigged there's no question about it because
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:45.200]  she said that read me out on cnn or earlier earlier last week or earlier this week calling me uh
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:50.640]  sent saying that i may have lied in the hearing and she's just you know all of the facts that she
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:55.920]  read out around as she was discussing me on cnn were also flawed i mean she doesn't even give
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:01.600]  her facts which he said that in 2004 and a guest op ed in the washington post that i had uh said
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:08.000]  that i that i was i had worked with latimer pooten also another lie if she read that op ed in 2004
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.200]  she would have understood that uh uh but i just as they read something in a fake newspaper like
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:16.960]  the new york times or washington post doesn't mean it's true i mean i've got right here madame
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:21.440]  president where hillary got elected president according to newsweek magazine it's not true
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:26.160]  uh i saw you on tucker carlson and from my research the whole russia gate it was absolutely
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:29.600]  the best testimony i've seen where you talked about of course the russians are trying to influence
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:34.720]  everybody does we do it i was sent in by the clinton's to actually keep yeltsin in power uh
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:42.640]  rehash some of that absolutely true rehash some of that but also why were you picked when when
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:47.280]  clearly you have a great record of serving this country why were you just picked out of the air
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:53.360]  to be the sacrificial lamb well i'll tell you i you mean uh for this hearing or for to go to
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:59.440]  russia just everything yeah the whole russia can all well i'll tell you i was in 1994 i had worked
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:06.800]  as the one of the press agent for bush clio 92 we had gotten beaten by the clinton's and the wall
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:12.960]  had fallen and i had worked for many years in the reagan doctrine programs uh trying to have put
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:17.360]  away this kind of communist conspiracy uh internationally and and it was interesting
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:22.160]  to watch it all fall and i wanted to go watch it fall in russia i didn't know much about russia so
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:27.760]  i told uh the agency that i was available agency for international development i may not have been
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.400]  their first choice because i was a republican but i was uh you know i came with some credentials
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.280]  working with youth i had worked in rocks of vote united states trying to get young people to vote
[02:18:37.280 --> 02:18:42.080]  in the real problem in russia was a young people who were all supporters of boris yeltsin we're
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:47.120]  not voting you were a young successful political operative uh that worked with mtv you name it
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:52.320]  bipartisan they sent you in right and so i started you know my first job when i went in there on
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:56.640]  behalf of the clinton administration paid by the united states agency for international development
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:03.520]  was to help uh develop and pass an election law uh they would bring a democracy about in russia it
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:08.720]  was a difficult process i did it in several states of russia as well once we got the election law
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:13.040]  passed i went to work to get rock to vote russia going trying to get rock and roll
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:18.080]  band to get involved in the program to promote voting as a civic duty for young people because
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:24.160]  we knew that young people were 85 pro yeltsin it was very successful um i had to have been it was
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:29.120]  a great sure so how do they turn to that and obviously above your agency was that program
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:33.280]  was done to being run by the state department cia so they have your file they know exactly what you
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:38.320]  did speak to that police because they're the ones trying to drag you it's really just about
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:41.680]  sound bites and getting that getting you know getting another story out there and trying to
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:46.640]  extend this bogus russia collusion collusion as long as they can that's all it's about i'm
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:52.160]  gonna be so desperate they go after people that are part of state department cia programs to keep
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:59.280]  a pro america got installed and democratize russia and that's your clear pedigree and they turn that
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:05.120]  around that you're the best they've got as the proof of russian collusion well also alex that was
[02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:11.760]  the 1990 in 2000 when latin air putin took over the the reins of the russian federation i moved
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:17.120]  home to america and i did a couple more things on behalf of russian companies but i never did any
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:22.320]  work for russia for latin air putin and represented jackie spear the initial insult to me was that i
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:28.960]  was putin's image maker she absolutely doesn't understand russian politics us russia diplomacy
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:34.480]  and doesn't understand what what tr is about or who i was representing and when but it was just
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:40.400]  about extending the bogus russia collusion delusion as long as possible meanwhile my wife
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:45.760]  and i are enduring uh are enduring death threats from people who hear her talking about me as a
[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:51.040]  trader on national television and it's just getting worse and worse i'm not going to sit around alex
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:57.840]  and wait to be the next person who gets shot by a democrat campaign volunteer who's all twisted up
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:02.240]  about this bogus russia stuff by the way i'm waiting around for that exactly michael caputo the reason
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:07.680]  i raised that is i have these people come up to me and scream at you russian spy once being wrong
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:11.920]  we were doing an interview in a hotel lobby it's on video the guy walks up like he was bowed up and
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:17.040]  i bowed up and i said let's go and of course he backed off but these people are crazy let's bring
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:20.560]  roger stone in who's sitting on the line i wanted to hold him over because he's an expert on this
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:24.080]  as well uh roger uh what are some angles i haven't hit with mr caputo
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:33.760]  he is two simple reasons uh one because he's been in russia he lived there and second because
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:39.680]  he had a pregnant wife there's no evidence whatsoever that ties him to any connection
[02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:46.480]  or communications with the russian state or any russian national during this election sadly the
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:51.840]  other reason i think they targeted him because he is a longtime trusted friend of mine we work
[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:58.240]  together for ronald reagan we work together for jack kem and i know he is a solid guy with a very
[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:04.720]  big following at wpb and they're in buffalo where he does conservative commentary but this is nothing
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:10.240]  less they had no probable cause no reason to drag him before the committee other than this mirror
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:18.480]  well also the cover of time has donnie jr on it with a little hitler mustache they put on
[02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:23.920]  and it says caught red-handed russia's not red anymore but it's also been the democrats that
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:28.640]  were always in bed with the russians when they were communist i just don't see this dog hunting
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:34.560]  michael caputo of politics ny dot net uh the latest target of the whole russia hysteria folks just
[02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:39.040]  joined us he testified in secret in congress it was supposed to be in secret the no transcript
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:42.480]  was given to him and now they have a congresswoman who wasn't even there running around saying he
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:48.720]  perjured himself true defamation or a man can't even defend himself uh but uh he's here doing it
[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:53.280]  despite the fact there's no record he's called for the record to be released uh six percent of
[02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:59.360]  americans in a gallup poll last week think russia is important uh 90 plus percent believe it is a
[02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:07.520]  hoax uh don't the democrats know this is a losing losing uh narrative well i'll tell you i don't
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:12.400]  think it matters to them at all they've lost all reason in this situation i mean they let me tell
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:17.920]  this is really a very successful gambit on their on their behalf to try and delay the president's
[02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:22.000]  agenda there's you know he hasn't been able to get voting on a lot of important issues
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.760]  because of this russia collusion collusion and they'll the problem i think is that they don't
[02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:32.240]  know how to stop you know somebody's already gotten shot because of their strategy representatives
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:36.400]  police and others on that baseball diamond and alexandra and they're pretending they have nothing
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:40.720]  to do with it and somehow another immediate let them get away with it it's going to happen again
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:45.120]  somebody else is going to get shot because these people are spinning up their base they're frossing
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:51.200]  up their base and they know they are and always when you froth at your base the the the bad apples
[02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:55.040]  are going to come to the top and they're going to buy guns and they're going to shoot people
[02:23:55.040 --> 02:24:00.320]  and i'm i'm tired of her running my name and my wife's name out in the middle of all this with
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:05.920]  absolutely no proof and now by violating the confidentiality of the hearing process nobody
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:10.720]  should go before the house intelligence committee in a closed hearing at all because they are going
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:15.680]  to get the exact same treatment i got they're going to get set up at least by jackie spear
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.800]  as they let fraydo back in the hearing room the minutes we have left with you since you raised
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:25.520]  that i mean here's an example of what they do trumps walking around at the beginning of the g20
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:30.400]  meeting you know a week and a half ago he gets out of the limo goes in there's a refreshment area
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:34.560]  he walks over shakes putin's hand in front of cameras everybody's shaking each other's hands
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:39.360]  and we shook 30 something hands walking in of other world leaders and their wives and dignitaries
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:44.560]  and ambassadors he walks over they talk a few minutes they say that's dirty and evil then he
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:48.800]  has his meeting they imply that oh he did a horrible job and he was a trader when he has a russian
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:52.640]  ambassador to the white house which is normal they say it's a secret meeting he gave up secret
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:57.040]  info went into the news two months at the isis is using laptop bombs and you know been in the
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:01.280]  cover of us today so he says hey let's work together to stop isis that's known we're doing that
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:08.240]  then on the last night the g20 seats him uh next to the japanese leader uh his wife could see the
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:12.720]  next to putin they wave and talk to each other across it he goes over and talks to him in front
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:19.120]  of everyone about pleasantries and they call it more sedition or espionage so you're right the
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:23.520]  the agenda isn't sold with the people but they don't care it's about hobbling the president
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:29.920]  with a bureaucracy where he can't engage in in in in foreign executive operations and where he
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:36.240]  suspects if he talks to the russian leader at a public dinner that he's supposed to i mean
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:41.120]  i think he should do his own meeting in rockyovac like like reagan did with gorbachev and get it
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:45.920]  in everybody's face and break the back of this what do you say i think i should do some one-on-one
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:50.720]  basketball shirtless i mean i don't care what they do you know the one thing labros says you know
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:54.480]  they may have had more meetings they may have even gone to the bathroom together i mean it's
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:59.520]  ridiculous let me tell you something alex one thing most americans don't know is we have hundreds
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:04.880]  look quite literally hundreds of russians who are now russian-americans people who had emigrated
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:09.040]  to the united states who have the highest level of security clearance in our government in our law
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:13.520]  enforcement and our intelligence agencies and our treasury department all over the place and
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:17.360]  they're doing yeoman's work they're doing excellent work for our country there's loyal as anybody
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:22.880]  else they are russian-american and they have you know top secret special information clearances
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:28.480]  and if uh someone talking to a russian waitress or someone waving across at each other across
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:33.360]  the reception of world leaders is an evidence is evidence of collusion then we better start looking
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:37.920]  at our own intelligence agencies our own law enforcement agencies our own administration
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:42.960]  department with the you know with excellent russian-american well let's expand on that we've
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:47.360]  got a great person came in when she was a little girl from russia to get away from the communism
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:52.400]  she was in army special operations highest level clearances and and but again she can't be trusted
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:57.840]  either see because she's an evil russian it's outrageous and and if this doesn't sound more
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:02.400]  and more like the mccarty i don't know what it does i mean i'll tell you when i sat in that hearing
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:07.920]  i have not talked about it because uh they asked me not to even though jackie spear has already
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:11.680]  talked about i've talked to my attorney maybe i'll start releasing more information but the one thing
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:17.840]  that did happen in that hearing is they asked me a long list me a list of names and if they asked me
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:23.040]  do you know this person you know that person i would go no yes and it's better the longer this
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:27.520]  list got and the more i heard it it sounded more and more like the mccarty well sure but trump is
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:31.280]  well known to all world leaders to pat him and say hey we're going to work together and try to sell
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:35.840]  him on stuff that's good for the u.s i mean he he points at russia points it himself does his hand
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:40.000]  shaking a fist like we're together of course he's saying we're going to work together because russia's
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:46.080]  free market now they're anti-radical islam what is this obsession in dc with continuing russia
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:51.680]  as the boogeyman when it's the communist chinese the cia admits have a hundred times the influence
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:58.640]  of the russians alex i'll tell you if if uh if the you know disney world in florida were
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:03.520]  some kind of an evil incarnate uh they would be wiping the floor with disney world right now and
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:08.400]  mickey mouse because donald trump once went there it doesn't matter who this is whether it's russia
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:14.640]  mickey mouse venezuela you know fort wane indiana they will tar the president with whatever they have
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.120]  it doesn't matter what it is they've got they got some traction with the russia thing because of
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:22.480]  the you know the negativity that's out there and it's all they've got and they're not gonna stop
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:27.440]  pushing that's it that's all they got and and in the end it's all gonna it's gonna dissipate to
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:31.360]  nothingness but as you mentioned at the top of the broadcast they're already expanding this
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:35.920]  investigation well beyond russia and that's what was all that's my final question and please come
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:42.720]  back what do you think uh mr caputo trump should do i mean uh i think you should fire miller fire
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:48.640]  the deputy attorney general all of them well i gotta tell you uh i'm i'm i'm a little dicey about
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:53.040]  firing you all right i do think that he should separate this investigation all the discussions
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:58.480]  of it out into an external unit he's already doing that but also stick to it we saw too many questions
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:03.920]  about the russia investigation and the white house press briefing absolutely drive a build a wall
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:08.640]  between the two of them and move forward and start driving his agenda for it and if if if uh
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:12.800]  miller gets out of line like he's already seen all the president's already drawn that red line
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:16.160]  it's time to consider whether or not this investigation i mean miller announced he's
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:22.560]  gonna see if trump's crap stinks today i mean yep yep but the question that we really have to have

[02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:13.680]  wrestling coach in illinois when he was what judge thomas durkin of the federal court
[02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:19.200]  described as a serial child molester because of the statutes of limitations for acts in the 1960s
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:24.160]  and 70s has run out has to it was not charged for any of the sexual abuse he engaged in if you can
[02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:30.400]  believe that he did go down for illegal hush money to the tune of at least 3.5 million dollars he was

[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:44.480]  molester is free once again after serving only 13 months judge durkin also said there's nothing
[02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:49.360]  more disturbing than having a child molester and speaker of the house in the same sentence i
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:54.160]  disagree there's nothing more disturbing than a serial child molester being free after only one

[02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:19.280]  and uh how they're trying to block president's agenda politics ny dot net uh but roger your
[02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:23.120]  plane's about to take off and telling you turn the phone off any other questions or comments
[02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:28.640]  for michael caputo yeah michael i'm curious what you thought of congresswoman spears claimed last
[02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:33.840]  week that she cannot be sued that there is no way to hold her responsible for the outrageous
[02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:40.720]  and def the famatory claim she's made against you nevermind debate saying that i worked for the
[02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:46.240]  kremlin to me that that doesn't seem right my lawyers are examining it i know a member is
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:52.240]  protected when they speak on the house floor but um when they go outside when they go on cnn for
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:58.080]  example and say that you have committed perjury a crime um can they be held responsible what
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:03.360]  what's your lawyer's reading my lawyers are looking at it as well because you as you know both of us
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:09.120]  were were trampled by here outside of the halls congress outside of her office but there is some
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:14.320]  indication uh that congressman can do whatever they want as long as they're pursuing house business
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:18.160]  and it's not clear whether that's true or not my attorneys are still taking it out but she's
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:22.240]  vulnerable on a lot of front fraudure you know a lot of this stuff is an ethical violation the
[02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:27.840]  things that she's doing are against the code of the uh the the uh the uh confidentiality of the
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:32.800]  hearings themselves uh you know literally quite literally this is the fraydo of the of the
[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:37.440]  intelligence committee well this is all part of the leaking culture look at spicer leaking to the
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:41.920]  daily beast leaking to the new york times before the president even knew i mean what does that say
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:47.440]  about spicer and you know the problem we have here is that this isn't even leaking leaking this is
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:54.160]  point out point blank flat out announcing it's not even leaking it's worse no matter if there's
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:58.400]  nothing to leak because there is no transcript there's nothing to give someone she's basically just
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:04.480]  lying in front of her she uses the secrecy to make up the fiction that's absolutely true that the
[02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:09.200]  same thing she did with roger saying that he was on the payroll of kremlin i mean this the problem
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:15.520]  she has that she lives in the delusion uh and that she's trying as as she as well as hard as she
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:22.400]  can to maintain a high profile through this whole collusion uh investigation that's all she's got
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:27.120]  nobody knows who she is and you know she's just really not that bright and she's making mistakes
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:32.560]  right and left and then a lot of in my and in my eyes in a lot of ways she's in she's in the jackpot
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:37.040]  herself for the things she said about myself and roger and other people well sure it's like the lady
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:41.120]  on the federal election commission saying i'm a russian agent just and it turns out she gets all
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:48.000]  this money from 22 foreign governments it's totally illegal and hillary going to uh marocco
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.160]  getting 12 million dollars while she's the secretary of state i mean these people are literally what
[02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:58.800]  they accuse us of roger we'll talk to you soon get that plane thank you roger there goes roger stone
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:03.440]  michael kaputa we were talking to the break and i said well that's powerful testimony
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:08.000]  can you repeat to the viewers and listeners what you were saying during the break about
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:13.520]  what their real agenda is and what could fix things versus what they're attempting right now
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:19.520]  sure in my opinion i think this is shared by a lot of people of the whole russian investigation
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:24.800]  is designed to delay or even stop the president's agenda and in fact while the president won
[02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:30.240]  election in november the democrats have won the first year i have no question they stalled
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:35.520]  in completely as a cynical political operative i would say what they decided to do they succeeded
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:42.240]  tremendously at but as an american i i really feel fear for the republic in my opinion this is
[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:48.080]  very clearly a uh it's a silent coup if nothing else i mean here the problem we have is this
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:52.480]  they're not stopping even though somebody gets shot because of what they've done one of their
[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:58.000]  own colleagues and they're not stopping and from my you know we look at the elinski's book and
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:03.360]  others the one chapter that they always forget to write is when do you stop when do you stop
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:08.240]  they're not stopping and the fact of the matter is maybe this will burn them themselves they'll
[02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:12.880]  burn themselves by going so far that they lose the 2008 elections that they have made complete
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:18.320]  pools of themselves or they could go the other direction and be a complete conflagration you
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:24.080]  know the one thing that everyone who's listening can do uh that is important to do is to call your
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:27.760]  republican representatives and tell them that you support the president and thank you for
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:32.400]  supporting the president because what the left is trying to do is separate the congress from the
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:37.440]  president and make them too fearful to vote for his agenda and it's working well yeah i mean
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:44.080]  that's what uh the whole agenda by soros is spending hundreds of millions he admitted
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:49.200]  sending on astro turf when they come back to their districts uh later next month to get in
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:54.480]  their face and and have robo calls and all this so now more than ever folks we ask for a president
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:38:02.080]  to fight globalism to defend our borders to get our jobs back it's happening they're going oh look
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:08.720]  he's failed at tax cuts and obama care well not for trying and and so it's our failure not backing
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:12.560]  him enough you want to look in the mirror and i'm not bitching at the listeners but but here's the
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:17.520]  bottom line i'm in this fight 18 hours a day and i know the russia thing is baloney because they had
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:21.920]  congressional hearings four months ago and again a week ago where they have armed services committees
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:27.760]  where they have people on there former board of governors fcc saying alex jones works for the
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:34.160]  kremlin and hillary just says i do look it's like saying you know that i'm a martian and the moon's
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:38.560]  made of cheese i know none of it's true i know i've never gotten russian money i know the russians
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:44.960]  don't tell me what to say i've never been to russia and it's just very very frustrating to sit here
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:50.960]  it's almost comical but it's almost like i'm in a bad dream or something to watch armed services
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:56.000]  committee hearings and i realized listen this is just about intimidating people they know it's bull
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.400]  and then what do you call these un-american groups that have hijacked the country these foreign
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:05.280]  multinational special interests pointing at us and saying we're foreign influenced because they're
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:11.040]  the globalists they are the outsiders they are the subverters that don't want to make america great
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:17.360]  again uh it couldn't be clear of a final comment on that mr caputo well i'll tell you the it's
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:21.360]  absolutely true and these are the people who are behind the russia collusion delusion the ones who
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:26.720]  are delaying the president agenda but there's nothing wrong with the president the white
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:31.920]  house administration there's nothing wrong with congress that three to four percent growth across
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:38.000]  six months couldn't fix three to four percent gross domestic product uh you know we have not had
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.520]  any healthy uh growth at all since rock obama was in office inherited a terrible economy but he never
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:49.040]  fixed it either it's it's don't fix it and he's working on i'm telling you his regulatory reform
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:56.080]  his global his uh his muscular energy policy is is very promising and if they manage to take
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:01.120]  apart obama care and kill the job-killing taxes that come along with it we're going to see some
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:05.760]  some some economic growth and if it gets to be in the three to four percent range it's difficult to
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:11.680]  do but if it does and he spends it for six months he's back and so is the republican congress well
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:16.240]  michael caputo uh no wonder they want to use s5 secret because you're a really smart guy and
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:20.560]  everything you've said is documented so we're all in this together literally thank you for joining us
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:26.320]  thank you alan there you go ladies and gentlemen what a time to be alive we're getting mark dice on
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:32.480]  the line they haven't called him a russian yet but i'm sure that's coming we got all these clips
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:35.760]  to where they say literally you can't talk to a russian or you're a russian agent and all the
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:41.280]  rest of it i've got a clip here of lou dobs saying exactly what caputo is just saying i wonder if
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:47.440]  they'll say lou dobs is a risky here it is your thoughts now on what is arguably the most politically
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:54.720]  corrupt department in the history of the american government i'm speaking of course of the obama
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:41:01.600]  justice department led by two attorneys general eric holder who ultimately became the first sitting
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:08.720]  cabinet officer ever to be cited for contempt of congress and his successor who is working on
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:16.400]  matching his record loretta lynch she according to the fire director of the fbi obstructed justice
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:23.520]  in ordering james call me to refer to the clinton email investigation as a matter rather than an
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:30.160]  investigation for the purpose of allowing the clinton campaign to deny the democratic nominee
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:36.160]  was under federal investigation today we learned of the prospect of additional corruption on the
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:42.560]  part of the obama justice department at issue why attorney general lynch went to almost
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:49.680]  unprecedented leaks to permit a russian attorney to enter the country without a visa long before
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:56.880]  meeting donald trump jr and jared kushner not the first scandal to plague that agency of course
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:05.280]  this meeting took place on june 9 of last year but it is unclear now not only why ag lynch would
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:11.200]  have given her an extraordinary waiver of us immigration laws but how that russian attorney
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:17.920]  could have been in the country some five months after the expiration of that so-called immigration
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:24.400]  parole waiver the senate judiciary committee is now investigating lynch's efforts to protect
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:29.920]  hillary clinton and the role of not only ag lynch now that's one club we've got another where he's
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:34.960]  on handity and says this is a coup against american people and attempt to break our will now joining
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:40.400]  us is one of the most prolific and successful people reaching tens of millions a week author
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:46.560]  you name it mark dice and a hard guy to get on i we're about to launch a bunch of new shows and
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:51.520]  stuff and i want to get him to be part of some of those uh but just amazing work at mark dice.com
[02:42:51.520 --> 02:42:56.880]  and of course his commentary he's always waiting and stuff breaks to get right on it and counter them
[02:42:57.600 --> 02:43:02.080]  and more and more they're trying to censor him off youtube cnn's been trying to censor him
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:07.280]  we're having them trying to shut down our channel right now with all these false violations uh and
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:11.920]  it's just really coming to a head and twitter is admitting that they are about to massively increase
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:18.800]  uh the censorship they say quote tenfold so i want to talk about this and just the general
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:24.880]  lay of the land with media critic mark dice mark thanks for coming on with us always good to join
[02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:29.440]  you alex yet the war against the independent media continues to ramp up they just had the sun valley
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:35.440]  conference which is basically the builder bird conference of tech in sun valley idaho a resort
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:41.040]  town where every year the big tech moguls and media companies purge to have discussions about
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:46.960]  acquisition new terms of service policies and so that's i think why we're starting to see some
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:52.640]  of this new censorship rolling out is this is coming out of the discussions that were held
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:58.800]  at sun valley sun valley of course this is where the cnn time Warner you were on a few months ago
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:04.240]  and predicted we'd see it after this and i noticed they just had the meeting and then it all happened
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:10.320]  the same day on monday so that you have nowhere to run basically this is where all the big wigs
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:14.720]  of media and now that tech how did you predict that because i'm impressed how did you predict that
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:19.760]  well when all these people when they have an annual meeting where they're going to get together and
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:23.840]  you kind of expect what their next move is going to be that's where they're going to collaborate
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:29.760]  kind of come to a consensus i mean essentially this is one of those big elite consensus building
[02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:34.240]  organizations like builder bird like the bohemian grove which also just happened but this is
[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:40.800]  specifically focused on tech it's not overtly sinister but this is where all of these big shots
[02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:45.360]  go and all the investors sure they couch it in stopping bullying but then they have these groups
[02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:49.680]  that go around bullying saying if you hurt their feelings talking about about hillary they ban you
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:54.160]  but yeah the double standard is incredible and that's part of the reason why my youtube channel
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:45:00.000]  has taken off for the last year because i started documenting the clear hypocrisy the violations of
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:03.600]  the terms of yeah talk about that i mean they'll have a facebook with a half million people for a
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:07.680]  year saying kill trump but we just say we don't like hillary and our thing gets suspended i mean
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:12.560]  it's crazy you know it's insane i i came across a very vicious video of somebody threatening
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:18.480]  police officers and i had reported it through one of my contacts and the nypd who actually
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:24.480]  worked with the trump campaign doing security for the then president elect and so they were
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.120]  investigating this individual reported it to youtube to have it taken down they got back with me and
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:32.640]  they said i think we talked about this before they just didn't violate the terms of service i mean
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:36.960]  this wasn't just somebody espousing you know kind of harsh opinions about the police i mean it was
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:44.480]  great of 100 percent wrath and incitement yet they're taking down conservative youtube channels
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:49.520]  thankfully you guys covered the story about p&n and youtube just pulling my video which was a very
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:55.360]  strange form of censorship i hadn't seen this before they locked my previous video on private
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:46:00.000]  they didn't strike it for community service violence young turks had that done to me well
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:04.560]  you know we had the live conversation which they set up and then suddenly our video was just private
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:10.160]  yeah so it wasn't copyright infringement because it was it was fair use it was
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:16.480]  completely transformative and so they literally just locked it on private and they sent me an email
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:21.440]  so that it was misleading but my video it couldn't get more ironic the joke just writes itself my
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:26.560]  video exposing cnn just with their own words and for folks that don't know tell folks about the
[02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:33.840]  censored video what you broke down i just compiled clips from cnn from the past maybe 12 months of
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:40.080]  just showing that you know their tagline is this is cnn so i just i titled the video this is cnn
[02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:46.480]  i showed people what cnn was i just used a bunch of different clips of them and remix them and it
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:52.640]  was transformative it was a completely different product than what it was that they put out but
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:55.840]  i think what they're going to start doing now instead of just filing copyright strikes because
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:59.280]  that's going to be a legal nightmare for them and they know that we're going to some of the bigger
[02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:03.360]  channels are just going to take them to court i think they're going to start using their content
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:08.000]  id system to block videos which has happened to me already in the past this is the second time that
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:14.080]  it happened where i had used the clip from a show and from janey fox talking about president obama
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:22.320]  calling our lord and savior and it was taken out and savior barack obama yeah now again it wasn't
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:27.520]  just uploading the clip in and of itself the clip was used in a three or four minutes i had him hit
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:34.000]  me with copyright when it's about me 100 defended by under free speech you as a citizen allowed to
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:38.640]  show a clip and respond under free speech it's totally covered courts have ruled a million times
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:43.360]  as you know but as you said they're starting to ignore that so they're freaking out which is why
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:49.040]  we saw one of their hosts alison camarado quits twitter literally the day after sabash and gorka
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:54.800]  just ridiculed her live in front of their i don't know 200 000 viewers talking about how the fact is
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:48:00.320]  that cnn has fewer viewers than reruns of yogi bear cartoons on nick and knight so this woman quit
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:06.080]  twitter not only did she quit twitter she wrote a breakup letter alex but i can read part of it to
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:12.560]  you here it is just absolutely bizarre she literally deleted her account and then wrote this letter
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:19.280]  saying dear twitter remember my first tweet back in may of 2009 happy mother's day
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:24.720]  my god listen to how hopeful i sounded back then i believe your promises that you would help me
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:29.600]  connect with people that you would be an agent for good in the world that you would get my messages
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:35.360]  out and help build a community back then you surprised me with flower emojis and thoughtful
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:40.480]  comments back then it was still thrilling to check in with you and see how many followers you'd
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:46.320]  brought me those were the days but something happened to you you're a shadow of your former
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:51.200]  self the one that i was first attracted to and this goes on and on now when i first heard about
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:56.960]  this i thought this was somebody mocking her quitting twitter this is her blog on cnn.com
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:00.640]  and now we have internal documents that came out a few months ago that facebook and twitter are mainly
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:06.480]  fake bots for liberals to keep them in a fake community believing and it's really ai computers
[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:13.040]  that then other people just copy and create kind of a feedback loop or an amplification snowball
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:18.640]  mockingbird deal and they admit we want to keep them desperate and liberal and alone and pathetic
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:25.280]  just like the wiki leaks say we've been so ahead of the curve that now finally over a decade after
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:31.600]  youtube has been in place years after you know youtubers like myself have used the platform
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:37.040]  to develop careers with audiences of millions of people now mainstream celebrities from elham
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:43.840]  degenerate to kim kardashian to katie perry are now joining youtube they are becoming
[02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:48.880]  youtubers that's how much we are affecting this that's how powerful this platform is
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:54.080]  and this was the first election the 2016 election where people really realized that
[02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:59.760]  youtube wasn't just for funny cat videos it wasn't even for just uploading clips of the news
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:06.480]  people realized that people like myself could develop a huge career and an audience of more
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:11.920]  people than watch these network television shows just using a cell phone or using a laptop and so
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:17.440]  that's why they're absolutely freaking out that's why they have mass demonetized channels the ad
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:23.680]  apocalypse where now ad revenue for news channels has dropped 90 percent they want to shut us down
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:28.080]  they were trying to go for our wallets and so it's an ever-adapting that's right let's stay there
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:31.680]  because they're launching all the censorship i want to get into uh censorship of independent
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:36.480]  media i want to get into the latest liberal insanity uh like the vagina challenge uh on the
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:40.800]  other side of this but when we return the first thing i want to get into is this it's more than
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:45.920]  just everybody having to go to youtube no one likes establishment hollywood or establishment red
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:50.000]  carpet now except for maybe dumb teenagers or something i don't mean all of them but some of
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  people really hate establishment stuff and there's nothing more americana than that we're finding our

[02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:32.160]  and he is basically replacing Sean Spicer but they're going to keep Huckabee's daughter who
[02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:36.400]  does a great job the rest of it i mean Spicer really has been leaking information out we now
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:40.640]  know that he did it again today and thank god Trump's doing this because you know they're coming
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:45.600]  after him they're coming after us we got this little segment than one more five more minutes
[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:49.280]  with him after this because then we've got Mike Cernovich coming up i'm going to play some of
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:52.720]  the scaramucci press conference with Mike Cernovich i'm going to coax a little bit with Mike because
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:58.240]  he likes it Mike's going to be hosting his own show three hours a day coming up uh in september
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:03.040]  david night starts next month with the morning show and i want to get Mark Dice involved as well
[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:07.280]  you're coming in a couple times a week or more if he wants you know to air the great pieces he's
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:10.880]  doing but i want to get back into the death of mainstream media and the fact that that's already
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:16.400]  happened but used to i wasn't really into hollywood but i'd still go out there you go out there you
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:22.400]  know a lot of the folks as well but it went from just not being a big deal to my audience hating it
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:26.560]  even if the hollywood person was a patriot they're sick of it and i don't want to really go to movies
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:33.520]  anymore more and more people i know are just sick of all the fake glitz sick of uh you know all the
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:37.680]  garbage we're just at a certain point we're just turning away from it and i think the
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:44.480]  establishment realizes that yeah mtv news is failed they've just tried to re remodel themselves
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:48.880]  obviously their youtube channel can't even get literally a thousand views on some of their videos
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:54.960]  with big well-known or formerly well-known celebrities and musicians they're they went full
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:56:01.120]  blown social justice warrior cnn is failing mtv shows like dear white people for every episode
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:07.280]  says whites are inherently evil vice news is laying people off the cnn app has last i checked
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:13.280]  one star a one star rating everything that these mainstream media folks do it only ends up backfiring
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:19.120]  because there is a resurgence of true americanism true conservatism rising and we're sick of this
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:25.840]  brother we're not just saying this but a mainline culture is so uncool all the young people at my
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:29.840]  children's school and other school events where other schools are i'm not just bragging i'm like a
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:35.120]  rock star with 12 year olds i know you are they run up and say you know mark dice you know paul
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:39.360]  watching you know gabham again is you know you know you know and the parents of all the kids
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:44.240]  run over because their kids all watch i mean that's got a scary establishment they're absolutely
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:48.000]  freaked out which is why they had the adpocalypse trying to hit us where it counts they're gonna
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:53.280]  probably start removing more content through the content id particularly the news and analysts
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:56.960]  channel but don't they know the kids are gonna find it you try to take something away from kids
[02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:02.800]  yeah they're they're gonna lose either way i mean jimacosta got so triggered by me on twitter
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:08.000]  that he blocked me he literally the guy who proclaims that he's proud that the president called him
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:13.200]  fake news i called him fake news and sent him a scooby-doo meme and he literally blocked me
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:18.000]  with alice and camaradas quitting twitter they don't know what to do they see us as the new
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:24.400]  media and it's not just us i mean there are thousands of smaller chance popping up and i mean
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:30.240]  when i say smaller i mean you know even if a channel has 10 000 subscribers that's 10 000

[03:00:14.880 --> 03:00:20.160]  it's alex jones well i know for a fact my son of it has some great white house contacts we'll get
[03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:24.160]  his take on this big shake up with the white house coming up the next segment what a broadcast
[03:00:24.160 --> 03:00:30.080]  day i don't know where my show folder is but we have just had so many great guests on uh the
[03:00:30.080 --> 03:00:34.960]  insanity you know the establishment is trying to censor is trying to shut us down it's trying to
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:39.600]  bully it's trying to call for violence we now learn that obama wanted to have marshal already
[03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:45.280]  the day after the election but blanked that's mainstream news our credibility only goes up
[03:00:45.280 --> 03:00:51.040]  but the left seems to get more zombie ish more insane as i show in this new video where we had
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:59.440]  a documentation to the whole bon iver uh video that time warner's super deluxe put out an attempt
[03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:05.040]  to hurt me got like 20 million views now and only helped us more young people uh tuned in but but
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:09.520]  the how are they counter striking i know one point you wanted to get into was the latest liberal
[03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:16.720]  insanity well it's almost impossible in many cases to tell whether or not something is satire or
[03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:22.720]  something that it's what the liberals want to do or try to do or are doing and so there is a new
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:26.640]  internet challenge we've seen some of these like the ice bucket challenge a few years ago
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:31.440]  you know people videotape themselves getting ice water dumped on them and posted online we've seen
[03:01:31.440 --> 03:01:36.080]  some really bizarre ones the Kylie Jenner lip challenge where a bunch of kids were sucking on
[03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:40.800]  shot glasses to swell up their lips hoping that they would puff up and look like Kylie Jenner's
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:46.400]  so now we have a new one and i thought that this was a prank from 4chan i really had to
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:51.440]  do some serious research into this it it sounds like a prank but i assure you that this is actually
[03:01:51.440 --> 03:01:58.080]  what they're doing the vagisil feminine itch cream company has launched a supposed internet
[03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:03.040]  challenge they're calling it the vagina challenge to search for hashtag vagina challenge on twitter
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:09.120]  as you will see where they are encouraging women and some of them are already to scream the word
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:15.600]  vagina out in public and videotape themselves supposedly to raise awareness for women's health
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:21.680]  alex and they're donating five dollars to plant parenthood of all people for every time that this
[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:27.600]  happened now when i first heard this i thought this is a 4chan hoax to try to dupe you know
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:33.440]  idiots into screaming vagina and videotaping it and posting it online but it is on the vagisil
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:38.400]  dot com official website they they actually have a twitter account which is followed by about 30
[03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:43.760]  people there are 30 women apparently you want to follow a you know vaginal itch cream accounts on
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:49.520]  twitter and so they are reposting these videos and so i put a couple of them up on youtube.com
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:55.120]  slash mark dice and the ceo of the company is doing it so they they now let's be clear what's
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:59.440]  happening is the globalists know that the desperate leftists will do anything for acceptance so
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:03.760]  they're chomping them and trolling them creating a controversy by getting liberals to go out and
[03:03:03.760 --> 03:03:08.080]  act like fools don't you agree that this is them trolling their own moron constituency
[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:14.960]  you and to try to promote vagisil through social media which is very strange because
[03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:22.160]  i mean the women who are screaming vagina based off the vagisil channel challenge i mean it really
[03:03:22.160 --> 03:03:26.560]  says something about them and if you just take a look at them you'll you'll start to see a pattern
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:32.720]  between all of them but they sure exactly but it also shows just just like you know they made the
[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:38.160]  word negro racist that just means negro or black like caucasian means from the caucus mountains
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:42.720]  if you know it's also about demonizing words and just training us that they can ban any
[03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:46.960]  word they want here here let's hear a scream the word vagina in public here it is today
[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:54.480]  so that i could take the vagisil vagina challenge to support women's health and basically what it is
[03:03:54.480 --> 03:04:00.960]  is for every vagina challenge video that's uploaded they'll donate five dollars to plan
[03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:08.400]  parenthood to help kill more babies here it goes vagina i tag jamie carly and so this is like a
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:15.280]  participation trophy right it's just they're trolling these morons yeah and it's a pathetic viral
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:21.040]  media attempted marketing plan as well that has backfired almost as bad as the one we talked about
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:29.520]  last time i was on which is the dove body wash um obese bottles where they a half a dozen bottles
[03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:34.480]  they apparently they think that women want a body wash bottle that is you know fat and obese
[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:40.640]  and so they came out a half a dozen different shaped body wash bottles from dove so that women
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:46.000]  can have a custom uh you know body wash mark you're amazing i watch everything you do we really
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:51.040]  appreciate you please join us again more there goes mark dies i tell you this endless material
[03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:56.080]  with these crazy liberals it's just they've been trained to not be self-sufficient so just
[03:04:56.640 --> 03:05:02.560]  there's just nothing they won't do just six percent of americans say the russian collusion
[03:05:02.560 --> 03:05:06.880]  conspiracy theory is important the data wire pointed out that in a bloomberg survey pulling
[03:05:06.880 --> 03:05:10.560]  americans on what they feel is the most important issues concerning the trump administration 35
[03:05:10.560 --> 03:05:15.040]  percent said health care 13 percent said the economy 11 percent said terrorism and immediately six
[03:05:15.040 --> 03:05:19.280]  percent said president trump's relationship with russia was an important issue for them then why
[03:05:19.280 --> 03:05:23.520]  does the mainstream media spend so much time focusing on the russia conspiracy theory simple
[03:05:23.520 --> 03:05:27.680]  they want to undermine the trump presidency to appease their bosses the globalist owners of
[03:05:27.680 --> 03:05:31.520]  major news corporations you see the best forms of propaganda spread through deception in the
[03:05:31.520 --> 03:05:35.440]  mainstream media role plays as objective journalists while pushing a globalist agenda we
[03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:39.440]  don't take it from me just look at the bloomberg article that accompanied the poll americans feel
[03:05:39.440 --> 03:05:43.760]  good about the economy not so good about trump the headline read oh really the top three issues
[03:05:43.760 --> 03:05:47.520]  that americans find important are the top issues that president trump ran on during his campaign
[03:05:47.520 --> 03:05:51.680]  the mainstream media hates trump for bringing back americana in the belief in national self
[03:05:51.680 --> 03:05:55.200]  determination and that's why they keep pushing the russian collusion conspiracy theory which
[03:05:55.200 --> 03:06:00.560]  cnn's van jones even admitted was a nothing burger this is kit daniels with info wars dot com as
[03:06:00.560 --> 03:06:06.240]  most of you already know i am a voracious consumer of news and information and in the last four or
[03:06:06.240 --> 03:06:11.440]  five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite establishment
[03:06:11.440 --> 03:06:16.960]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition
[03:06:16.960 --> 03:06:23.200]  than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting
[03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:29.280]  killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated
[03:06:29.280 --> 03:06:36.720]  bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and super charging
[03:06:36.720 --> 03:06:42.160]  the body at the same time info wars isn't just fighting the globalist we're getting results

[03:08:23.680 --> 03:08:32.560]  five months ago about a month into the administration that anthony scarab mochi is one of trump's
[03:08:32.560 --> 03:08:39.760]  favorites from the campaign to get stuff done and that he had him in there as one of his advisors
[03:08:39.760 --> 03:08:44.640]  and that they came in about a month in and said when the president was on trip you are fired the
[03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:49.920]  president doesn't like you and he was told this by rents previous and sean spice and then he called
[03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:52.960]  some of his friends that were outside of the white house and they said no that's what they're doing
[03:08:52.960 --> 03:08:59.840]  to other people uh don't leave was they'll tell trump you quit and asked to meet with the president
[03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:03.360]  well they wouldn't give him the meeting for a week or so but he went in and saw the president
[03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:08.880]  president waved him in the president got real mad how do you think sean spicer feels when he tried
[03:09:08.880 --> 03:09:16.000]  to go in there and hopes anthony scarab mochi well you're getting an exclusive but the media
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:20.800]  doesn't like us to have victories so they they never report on them well that is a mother will
[03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:27.840]  report on them like recent victories i've had will be nowhere in the newspapers here in austin
[03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:34.640]  texas because they just want to put out their perpetual hoaxes to the public so here's a few
[03:09:34.640 --> 03:09:40.080]  minutes about them we're going to mike sernovich probably the hardest working guy out there i i

[03:10:34.560 --> 03:10:39.600]  starting about day 70 by about a day 110 he turned back towards total liberty because they
[03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:43.760]  weren't compromising and now the word is he's really going after muhler and all these other
[03:10:43.760 --> 03:10:47.600]  phonies who have the biggest drag nets in history but first here's anthony scaramucci

[03:11:55.120 --> 03:12:01.760]  mic the mic it's yeah day one we're gonna game this guy because they're sitting there for a couple
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:06.640]  hours what are we gonna do act like you don't hear his mic make him look like he fumbled when he
[03:12:06.640 --> 03:12:10.800]  came out because they're all thinking how do we how do we manipulate trump say he's the brain of
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:16.000]  trump yeah yeah do that next so so let's start that over to see the anatomy of a sign up because i
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:21.440]  know microphones i know that you can hear it on it's on the pa in the little room they can hear it
[03:12:21.440 --> 03:12:25.520]  the room's so small they can hear him from his own voice here it is
[03:12:25.520 --> 03:12:36.560]  better better now better now back that up to the beginning back it up see the whole time you
[03:12:36.560 --> 03:12:40.800]  can hear the mic you can hear it's on he hits it earlier it's working he starts talking they
[03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:46.800]  still say they can't hear that's these are scum their whole life is about deceiving it's about
[03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:51.920]  hating people it's about in unit unison lying when black lives matter kills more people
[03:12:51.920 --> 03:12:56.000]  mike sernovich has been there he's witnessed it he's called them out we're gonna play more of this
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:13:00.640]  in a moment but mike all of this is so educational do you not see the dirty trick what do you think
[03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:06.880]  about that yeah it's good to get behind the news and behind the scene and that of course is why
[03:13:07.440 --> 03:13:12.960]  they oppose what we're doing is we take people behind the scenes of how they manipulate the
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:19.360]  message and lie and deceive and feed people fake and false information it's it's textbook it's
[03:13:19.360 --> 03:13:25.120]  just like they lit you up like a pumpkin for the megan kelly thing all all these dirty tricks are
[03:13:25.120 --> 03:13:29.840]  to be expected but i mean his mic's on from the beginning you've been there it's a little bitty
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:34.240]  room with a broken bathroom next to it it's a filthy little hole i mean literally what the
[03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:39.520]  room's like 25 feet from the front of the back maybe 30 feet but he's the mic's on you can hear
[03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:44.000]  it and they just keep saying no no no it's not working let's play the clip again here it is

[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:36.320]  thank personally sean spicer uh not only on behalf of myself the president the administration
[03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:41.040]  but sean is a true american patriot he's a military serviceman look at that hero
[03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:46.400]  family uh and he's done an amazing job this is obviously a difficult situation he was fired
[03:14:46.400 --> 03:14:51.040]  and i applaud his efforts here i love the guy and i wish him well uh and i hope he goes on
[03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:57.760]  to make a tremendous amount of money um as it relates to me uh in this position uh i'm gonna
[03:14:57.760 --> 03:15:03.840]  spend a couple of weeks getting to know the uh the people here uh and i'm going to be as coordinated
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:08.480]  as i can with the people inside the west wing uh there's going to come back to more of those
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:12.400]  questions but i want to turn this over if he wants to play it uh to the one the only mike
[03:15:12.400 --> 03:15:18.800]  sternovich mike uh wow what does this signify trumps doing uh a b what is your intel telling
[03:15:18.800 --> 03:15:22.640]  you and i'm going to turn this over to again uh mike sternovich go ahead my friend yeah that
[03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:28.640]  clip is funny too because the white house press room is tiny it it's about the size of your your
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:33.680]  studio where you do your main show so the idea that they couldn't hear them even if the microphone
[03:15:33.680 --> 03:15:38.960]  had been working they're they're so fake dude they they're just trolling him like they do all the time
[03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:45.120]  scare moochie or moochie as his friends call him this is a very very very big move i knew about
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:49.680]  this a while ago i just hadn't reported it i had to embargo it a little bit but you know you and i
[03:15:49.680 --> 03:15:55.440]  both had got sources that spicer was out spicer tried to block it previous tried to block it
[03:15:55.440 --> 03:16:00.240]  previous has been leaking negative stories about scare moochie since last night he was up on the
[03:16:00.240 --> 03:16:05.920]  phone all night calling political wash and post new york times cnn try and get them to i can't
[03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:10.160]  believe trump puts up with this the one criticism is he needs to get rid of all those guys now
[03:16:11.360 --> 03:16:16.080]  yeah trump still doesn't really understand he's getting it though the the good guys are moving in
[03:16:16.080 --> 03:16:23.920]  and scare moochie has a a better understanding of media than spicer spicer all he had was playing
[03:16:23.920 --> 03:16:28.480]  defense and answered press releases and everything moochie understands that you actually have to
[03:16:28.480 --> 03:16:33.120]  create content you have to push your own you have to create the narrative you have to create the
[03:16:33.120 --> 03:16:37.840]  story because it the story's america and prosperity and fighting tyranny not let them control the
[03:16:37.840 --> 03:16:43.040]  narrative exactly the way i always put it is that if you didn't exist and social media didn't exist
[03:16:43.040 --> 03:16:48.560]  just what good about trump would ever be heard what defense about trump would ever be heard
[03:16:48.560 --> 03:16:53.360]  take away alex jones take away social media and there's no messaging coming out they have an
[03:16:53.360 --> 03:16:59.840]  entire communications team but all they do is the the medial they stick a fan around all day brown
[03:16:59.840 --> 03:17:04.880]  nose and give bj's quite frankly uh two other liberal media hoping they can be part of the in
[03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:09.280]  crowd they're all trying to feather their nest to go get a job at you know fox news or cnn
[03:17:09.280 --> 03:17:15.360]  that too and they also want to be like sean spicer definitely wants to be liked scare moochie
[03:17:15.360 --> 03:17:21.440]  understands new media better the way i always put sean spicer is he never did new media any favor
[03:17:21.440 --> 03:17:25.760]  he never did he never did anything for us he never did anything for the resistance of the
[03:17:25.760 --> 03:17:30.000]  patrons he's just another well i'm not gonna announce it sean spicer who deliberately killed
[03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:35.840]  us getting press passes over and over again and literally people above him aka you know who had
[03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:41.840]  to get us in yeah i'd had you know spicer i don't want i can't go into the full details of it but
[03:17:42.400 --> 03:17:47.360]  spicer had definitely tried to sabotage me before too and that that is a slight that of course i
[03:17:47.360 --> 03:17:51.840]  did not forget and i do not forget those kinds of things so it's politics what rinse previs has
[03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:57.760]  to understand is that we don't know him anything we're not republicans we are trump republicans
[03:17:57.760 --> 03:18:04.080]  patriots trump yeah previs is up next on the shocking block uh i wonder how long till he gets
[03:18:04.080 --> 03:18:09.760]  thrown out the airlock yeah trump has wanted to get rid of these guys for a while the issue
[03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:16.320]  there's so much going on i gotta be careful what i said mcmaster just held a meeting to discuss me
[03:18:16.320 --> 03:18:20.320]  i'll believe it or not we'll talk about that maybe with you now or at the end of the segment
[03:18:20.320 --> 03:18:25.600]  we're gonna skip this break go ahead and take over start give us the data yeah so there was a story
[03:18:25.600 --> 03:18:30.960]  in bloomberg that just broke right before i got on air actually and mcmaster held a meeting to talk
[03:18:30.960 --> 03:18:36.640]  about my twitter account and he said in this meeting there's no such thing as an obama holdover
[03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:41.840]  and that you guys should know that sternovich is a bad person because i've been talking about these
[03:18:41.840 --> 03:18:47.280]  obama holdovers in the deep state within the um the nsd and the rest of the intelligent
[03:18:47.280 --> 03:18:51.920]  sure they had foreign affairs and public affairs all the elite publications by names say you're
[03:18:51.920 --> 03:18:56.720]  dangerous you've got real sources and you're hurting deep states attempt to sabotage the country
[03:18:56.720 --> 03:19:01.760]  so now mcmaster's had a meeting about you again yeah yeah exactly just broke on bloomberg i texted
[03:19:01.760 --> 03:19:04.800]  him the story a couple minutes ago so they should be able to give us the headline we'll put it on
[03:19:04.800 --> 03:19:09.200]  screen what's the headline yeah yeah here the headline is um here let me um i'll pull it up
[03:19:09.200 --> 03:19:15.680]  right now the headline is the adults are out of the room it's a very nasty article about bannon
[03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:21.280]  trumps access of adults is breaking apart so it's of course a bloomberg or glow it's terrible
[03:19:21.280 --> 03:19:26.000]  there's actually people that want the country's future in you know that they're battling back
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:33.120]  it's terrible yeah so in that story they go hr mcmaster said there are no holdovers and he
[03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:38.960]  was responding to a series of tweets by mike sternovich and but it's admitted that trump can't
[03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:43.680]  get his people in and that obama's told the new york times i'm putting people in everywhere so that
[03:19:43.680 --> 03:19:48.960]  trump can't dig them out that was in all the newspapers exactly and mcmaster is starting
[03:19:48.960 --> 03:19:54.160]  with the obama holdovers he's actually saying that there's no such thing as an obama holdover
[03:19:54.160 --> 03:19:57.920]  these are all great people even though those people are sabotaging trump they're leaking to
[03:19:57.920 --> 03:20:04.320]  trump and everything the interesting thing though alex is just how shaken up that they are
[03:20:04.320 --> 03:20:09.440]  at the next paragraph of the article they say that mcmaster was responding to a series of tweets
[03:20:09.440 --> 03:20:14.640]  by mike sternovich they have to respond to us now this is a whole new media landscape that
[03:20:14.640 --> 03:20:20.880]  scar mucci understands and john spicer never did the the national security advisor they're
[03:20:20.880 --> 03:20:25.600]  they're monitoring i've information they monitor info and they go on admit the precarious position
[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:30.800]  this is the elite talking to themselves in bloomberg oh no if trump reads this he's going to figure it
[03:20:30.800 --> 03:20:36.800]  out we're so precarious which shows you how pathetic they are yeah that's actually a great
[03:20:36.800 --> 03:20:42.000]  point bloomberg is very upset to know that you and i have more influence in the media
[03:20:42.720 --> 03:20:48.160]  than bloomberg has right now the real national security journalism is on info wars com it's on
[03:20:48.160 --> 03:20:53.440]  uh facebook.com well let's say it i mean you've really gotten other skin you get special special
[03:20:54.640 --> 03:20:59.920]  you know special recognition here you've done just a great job but so what does this signify
[03:20:59.920 --> 03:21:04.480]  how pathetic they are that everybody knows they're deep state dug in and they're bitching and
[03:21:04.480 --> 03:21:10.960]  complaining that we're exposing it yeah and that's why the adl is doing a target list form policy
[03:21:10.960 --> 03:21:16.080]  at done hey oh that's why i wanted to get you on yeah they like literally put you next to neo nazis
[03:21:16.080 --> 03:21:19.440]  and in clio they're trying to get somebody just like southern prairie law center has gotten a
[03:21:19.440 --> 03:21:24.480]  bunch of people shot when they attacked the family research council i mean they really are crazy
[03:21:25.280 --> 03:21:30.800]  yeah so there's an alliance now with the adl they're unhinged readers there's an alliance with
[03:21:30.800 --> 03:21:36.800]  deep state form policy and the just society which is owned by george soros did a hate job on me
[03:21:36.800 --> 03:21:42.560]  but they're losing for example we had um josh mandel to a very courageous thing josh mandel is
[03:21:42.560 --> 03:21:48.800]  running for um senate in ohio and he goes you know what i'm tired of these witch hunts by the adl
[03:21:48.800 --> 03:21:54.800]  the adl is no longer about protecting jews it's about protecting left wing where is the list of
[03:21:54.800 --> 03:22:00.880]  it's about protecting soros listed as an enemy of israel in the wiki like saying overthrow israel
[03:22:00.880 --> 03:22:06.320]  and give it to the muslims that's what's crazy is the adl literally works directly against israel
[03:22:06.960 --> 03:22:11.360]  exactly in keith allison as a member of the muslim brotherhood he definitely hates jewish
[03:22:11.360 --> 03:22:15.840]  people he hates this really hits a lot of things the bottom line the leftist jews have completely
[03:22:15.840 --> 03:22:21.120]  met an alliance with radical islam and and just like soros helped round up jews for hetler he's
[03:22:21.120 --> 03:22:27.040]  doing it again today i mean soros is literally the number one living nazi right and conservative
[03:22:27.040 --> 03:22:32.640]  jews are seeing that and that is why i've always been an outspoken an outspoken critic of anti
[03:22:32.640 --> 03:22:37.040]  semitism what i've been telling people as i go if you think that jews just all think alike you
[03:22:37.040 --> 03:22:42.000]  don't really understand you're playing into the globalist master manipulation yeah exactly the
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:47.760]  globalist want to make it seem like all jews are anti america and that actually isn't true the adl
[03:22:47.760 --> 03:22:54.400]  is anti america the adl is anti freedom but there are many because they go back to the jewish mafia
[03:22:54.400 --> 03:23:00.800]  in 1913 founded it it was the jewish mafia feeding off jews abusing jews and it was a jewish mafia
[03:23:00.800 --> 03:23:05.680]  in europe that wouldn't let jews get out and made them pay money to him so it's always been the group
[03:23:05.680 --> 03:23:11.920]  that feeds on the jews working with the nazis exactly the adl would extort jews actually and
[03:23:11.920 --> 03:23:17.680]  what the adl is doing now is extorting jews they're saying oh my god look at all these people most of
[03:23:17.680 --> 03:23:22.160]  the people that mentioned on the list i'd never heard of some guy with 100 people read his blog
[03:23:22.160 --> 03:23:27.440]  he gets two blog comments the other and i put you in with a nazi guy that you've openly made fun of
[03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:34.880]  it's just it's crazy yeah and this is extorting jews they want to scare jews and make them terrified
[03:23:34.880 --> 03:23:40.160]  so that they can get more money and more donations and everything so it's another form of terrorism
[03:23:40.160 --> 03:23:48.640]  by the adl and then now they've listed you everything your family it's just but i'm i'm happy
[03:23:48.640 --> 03:23:53.040]  that the way i always tell people is hey i'm on video every day do i look do i look shook
[03:23:53.040 --> 03:23:57.280]  are my hands shaking do i look well sure they've been attacking me for a long time too it's just that
[03:23:58.640 --> 03:24:02.480]  i mean they're like putting you and others like literally on the page next to nazi's
[03:24:02.480 --> 03:24:07.360]  heiling hitler hoping somebody obviously comes after you yeah and they don't but they don't
[03:24:07.360 --> 03:24:12.160]  have any spiritual core they actually made a mistake too a lot of my friends people forget
[03:24:12.160 --> 03:24:16.080]  that you and i both we have a lot of liberal friends out there and we have liberal friends in
[03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:22.640]  very high places and they have told me they said the adl is going to be like the splc now nobody's
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:25.920]  going to actually take them seriously respect them they're going to view them as a left wing
[03:24:25.920 --> 03:24:32.240]  advocacy organization the adl doesn't know what it's like to go after somebody like me who people
[03:24:32.240 --> 03:24:37.920]  know that i can be an a hole sometimes i can be a little grady i'm not always the nicest guy and
[03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:44.080]  you know like all people i'm a center and i work on it but a hate group leader that is so ridiculous
[03:24:44.080 --> 03:24:48.720]  that even the liberals who hate me were saying well i i even had multiple people hundreds say
[03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:53.040]  dude i actually think sternovich is a bad person but he's not a hate group exactly it's beyond just
[03:24:53.040 --> 03:24:57.360]  calling you a racist with no evidence they're putting you in magazines they mailed millions of
[03:24:57.360 --> 03:25:02.800]  people next to nazis which which again it just shows they're totally deceptive and the truth is
[03:25:02.800 --> 03:25:05.840]  coming out about them look i gotta turn the show over to you because i want to listen to it myself
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:10.320]  i'll eat my lunch my sternovich takeover very excited about a lot of the stuff we're working on
[03:25:10.320 --> 03:25:14.720]  my friend really appreciate you and uh i always see you backing me up too i'm trying to back you
[03:25:14.720 --> 03:25:19.280]  up with the great work you're doing so take over my friend thanks alex yeah definitely we gotta

[03:25:51.680 --> 03:25:57.280]  you it's just been a there's like great awakening like george whitefield had done their their cycles
[03:25:57.280 --> 03:26:03.120]  of history and right now we're experiencing a new great awakening where millions of people
[03:26:03.120 --> 03:26:08.320]  are waking up all the time trump is gaining 300 000 new social media followers a day paul joseph
[03:26:08.320 --> 03:26:13.280]  wasin's almost gonna hit a million youtube subscribers i can't even keep up with all my
[03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:19.200]  platforms anymore my facebook did over a hundred million unique hundred million unique people on
[03:26:19.200 --> 03:26:25.920]  my facebook page last month i'm 80 million unique video views at facebook.com forward slash mike
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:31.920]  sternovich so that has become a platform and even um i don't know if you guys talked about this yet
[03:26:31.920 --> 03:26:37.440]  the bus fee ben wrote an article about what if right wing media were good and he talks about the
[03:26:37.440 --> 03:26:43.680]  high production level of info wars actually i mean here let me see if i can find this on my phone
[03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:47.760]  because i was sending this out it was such an important article sorry if i'm breaking eye contact
[03:26:47.760 --> 03:26:53.200]  with you live viewers i i'm thinking of you and everything but even even bus feed here i'll see
[03:26:53.200 --> 03:26:58.240]  if i can pull it up even bus feed is admitting how talented the info wars team is this is called
[03:26:58.800 --> 03:27:04.080]  the headline is what if trump tv was good and it's in bus feed and they talk about the high
[03:27:04.080 --> 03:27:09.920]  production level coming from alex jones and again these are people who who don't agree with alex
[03:27:09.920 --> 03:27:14.720]  so like info wars here's where he goes he talks about how most conservative media and this is a
[03:27:14.720 --> 03:27:21.520]  fair point is a little bit ratty and dingy not very good he goes there are exceptions alex jones
[03:27:21.520 --> 03:27:28.640]  spends lavishly on production and it shows i mean you want to talk about begrudging begrudging respect
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:35.680]  from the enemy from ben from bus feed he's even saying it's right below the video so if you scroll
[03:27:35.680 --> 03:27:40.480]  down a little bit more you'll be able to see it he even says alex jones spends lavishly on production
[03:27:40.480 --> 03:27:46.480]  and it shows i mean you want to talk about that's as high praise as you can get for the info wars
[03:27:46.480 --> 03:27:50.800]  team right there doesn't get you can't get better praise than that because again that is coming
[03:27:50.800 --> 03:27:57.600]  from bus feed ben who is the i think either ceo or editor-in-chief of bus feed news in
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:28:02.800]  an article in bus feed talking about why right wing media isn't very good the production and
[03:28:02.800 --> 03:28:08.480]  it is first class that is what a lot of people don't realize even though we are the resistance that
[03:28:08.480 --> 03:28:11.600]  well since you raise this i'm sitting here watching i say i'm going and then i'm sitting
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:17.520]  here watching while eating my chicken the thing is most talk show hosts get to this level we'll
[03:28:17.520 --> 03:28:20.720]  just have a mansion or a private plane i don't have that not that a mansion or private plane's
[03:28:20.720 --> 03:28:24.800]  bad i want to beat the globalist our listeners want to beat the globalist and so when they buy
[03:28:24.800 --> 03:28:31.280]  stuff from us 97 percent of it goes back into the fight and so the america's sick of the globalist
[03:28:31.280 --> 03:28:35.360]  having all the money we don't have sorrows we don't have taxpayer money like nbc we have the

[03:33:20.560 --> 03:33:27.680]  there's a lot of reason to be optimistic there is of course the media attacking us every day foreign
[03:33:27.680 --> 03:33:33.280]  policy coming after me foreign policy wrote a major hate article on me a week ago where they
[03:33:33.280 --> 03:33:40.000]  attacked me and then i did some research and they cosponsored the research on me with an
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:46.880]  organization called just security and then if you go to the just security website whose names you see
[03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:54.960]  me the open foundation society george soros you can look all this stuff up to that is what i love
[03:33:54.960 --> 03:34:02.080]  when the fake news media calls this all conspiracy theory i can show you that george soros funds the
[03:34:02.080 --> 03:34:08.320]  organization that attacks me and they're attacking me because i'm going after deep state and i'm going
[03:34:08.320 --> 03:34:14.080]  after people are leaking to the media they go after me for that and then one week after that
[03:34:14.080 --> 03:34:21.120]  article paid for by george soros mcmaster is holding a meeting with the entire nsc to tell them that
[03:34:21.120 --> 03:34:29.280]  i'm a bad person the open society foundation by just security well well well right oh it's a conspiracy
[03:34:29.280 --> 03:34:36.240]  theory sernovich soros isn't after you i can i can show you we're not playing a difficult game of
[03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:42.000]  connecting the dot i can show you and then of course bloomberg reported just about 45 minutes
[03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:49.040]  ago that article about the axis of adults mcmaster is holding interviews to talk about me that's because
[03:34:49.040 --> 03:34:54.720]  mcmaster has been leaking information a lot of these media sources are coming from mcmaster
[03:34:55.680 --> 03:35:01.440]  that's why you don't read bad coverage about mcmaster so they're all they're all freaking out
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:06.880]  it goes conspiracy theory wait a minute but i can show you sources paying for it mcmaster is
[03:35:06.880 --> 03:35:11.280]  holding meetings about it i know i know all the information that comes and goes but that's why i'm
[03:35:11.280 --> 03:35:18.480]  so optimistic that has always tell people look at me do i look sick do i look nervous do i look tired
[03:35:18.480 --> 03:35:28.880]  this is a passion job because of you listeners like you we just saw buzzfeed again buzzfeed is
[03:35:28.880 --> 03:35:33.760]  never going to do info wars any favors buzzfeed ben is never going to do info wars any favors
[03:35:33.760 --> 03:35:42.240]  he says alex jones spends lavishly on production and it shows the reason that alex is able to spend
[03:35:42.240 --> 03:35:48.240]  lavishly on production is because of your sort your support at info wars store dot com and info
[03:35:48.240 --> 03:35:54.640]  wars life dot com right now there are big big specials going on caveman is finally back in
[03:35:54.640 --> 03:36:02.080]  stock strawberry flavor 25 off true way protein vanilla a lot of things going on and this is
[03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:08.880]  what funds the lavish production values you couldn't have the production level that's better than
[03:36:08.880 --> 03:36:15.760]  anything on the media i mean show me anything from the mainstream media better than that video alex
[03:36:15.760 --> 03:36:20.240]  at least yesterday show me anything of a higher production value than what you see every day
[03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:26.000]  at info wars that is why info wars store dot com you have the specials the products are good for
[03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:30.000]  you they're good for me i'm actually going to get some of that caveman stuff myself i'm a big believer
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:34.560]  in bone broth i actually buy packets of it because alex was out of stock at caveman so i don't feel
[03:36:34.560 --> 03:36:41.680]  bad saying this so i bought the packets from amazon i buy the chicken stock and also of the
[03:36:41.680 --> 03:36:46.240]  the beef broth i put it every day i actually had a shake like that before it so it's good for you
[03:36:46.240 --> 03:36:49.840]  you're going to feel better you're going to have better performance you're going to live a better
[03:36:49.840 --> 03:36:53.840]  life and you're going to fund the production and take the production to the next level
[03:36:53.840 --> 03:37:00.560]  level another kind of story to talk about dirsh beagle so dirsh beagle came out to my house i
[03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:06.640]  don't know it was a couple months ago they came out a couple months ago and visited the operations
[03:37:06.640 --> 03:37:12.560]  and stuff and i used to say no to all media i would tell everybody you know i've turned down the
[03:37:12.560 --> 03:37:19.200]  new york times i've turned on vice i've turned on hbo because i don't know i what's the point it
[03:37:19.200 --> 03:37:24.080]  doesn't actually do anything for me that is what i try to explain to these people if you write about
[03:37:24.080 --> 03:37:30.320]  me the new york times i'm not going to sell more books my kickstarter for my documentary fake news
[03:37:30.320 --> 03:37:34.400]  isn't going to get more backers i'm not going to get more people to attend my guerrilla mindset
[03:37:34.400 --> 03:37:40.640]  seminars i'm not going to get more news i'm not going to do it's not it doesn't help me right it
[03:37:40.640 --> 03:37:45.680]  just it doesn't help me at all to talk to these people but then i realized that every time i
[03:37:45.680 --> 03:37:51.680]  actually talk to talk to them they don't talk about russia anymore so if you want to click on
[03:37:51.680 --> 03:37:57.120]  that link at the dirsh beagle articles in english they stop talking about russia because once they
[03:37:57.120 --> 03:38:03.600]  see my operation they realize okay we don't need russian robots philip actually was a very smart
[03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:08.240]  guy very good guy he's a liberal guy he has his bias but i don't have a problem i don't have a
[03:38:08.240 --> 03:38:14.880]  problem they call me conspiracy theory actually when they say conspiracy conspiracy terrorist
[03:38:14.880 --> 03:38:21.280]  mike sternovich because nobody really takes us seriously but when they come over they realize
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:26.400]  they are part of a conspiracy theory they believe that russian robots are responsible for what we
[03:38:26.400 --> 03:38:32.320]  do and then they come over and they watch me work and they go well wait a minute you can just do this
[03:38:32.320 --> 03:38:40.400]  from a phone you can just do right like right now when i go on info wars i'm on a laptop we're talking
[03:38:40.400 --> 03:38:45.040]  on skype that is running through a production team a first-class production team which even bus
[03:38:45.040 --> 03:38:52.640]  feed admits is the best production team in media right now periscope that's it phone that that is
[03:38:52.640 --> 03:38:57.040]  all you need to reach the world fun soft and that is of course why they're so afraid and why they're
[03:38:57.040 --> 03:39:04.560]  so angry because hr mcmaster the national security advisor is forced now to talk and have meetings
[03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:11.200]  about mike sternovich the guy in his cell phone no tv crew no people following me around no edited
[03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:16.240]  media and everybody here can join the info war everybody here can do a periscope everybody here
[03:39:16.240 --> 03:39:22.000]  can do youtube lives everybody here can call into the show everybody here can post the links to these
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:27.440]  videos to their social media we're on you when you're on youtube live right now with so many people

[03:39:32.080 --> 03:39:35.920]  watching on youtube live and hit the subscribe button because as you hit that like button it
[03:39:35.920 --> 03:39:40.800]  makes it trend and then everybody can share those links on twitter everybody can share those links
[03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:48.160]  on facebook that that's all there is so nobody whoever meets me and watches my operation that
[03:39:48.160 --> 03:39:53.200]  they never talk about russian robot armies on the internet again because they just didn't understand
[03:39:53.200 --> 03:39:57.600]  the tech to wait a minute you could just do this i had a gorilla mind because a lot of people don't
[03:39:57.600 --> 03:40:03.600]  know this i don't make my money doing journalism all of the money that i get from my kick starters
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:09.280]  my my recent run one has already raised a hundred twenty five thousand dollars i'm doing a documentary
[03:40:09.280 --> 03:40:15.040]  on fake news and how the fake news media has caused economic collapses wars and of course
[03:40:15.680 --> 03:40:19.600]  we'll definitely want to talk to alex jones because he's been a victim of fake news
[03:40:20.880 --> 03:40:25.920]  ten days left and it's already raised a hundred twenty three thousand dollars with over a thousand
[03:40:25.920 --> 03:40:32.080]  backers and if you click on that film and video and sort by popularity it's currently the second
[03:40:32.080 --> 03:40:39.200]  or third most popular kickstarter right now and the entire film and video thing that's the whole
[03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:45.440]  thing if it's sorted by popularity it is powerful now they'll never give me the new and noteworthy
[03:40:46.160 --> 03:40:51.600]  they'll never give me the magical one but if you go to popular hoax right there hoax is currently
[03:40:51.600 --> 03:41:01.200]  on kickstarter's own page the second most popular proud fund already that is how excited people are
[03:41:01.200 --> 03:41:05.520]  that is how excited people are and that is why you everybody listening we're entering a golden age
[03:41:05.520 --> 03:41:11.520]  of media i was in nostalgia i didn't really know who alex jones was a year ago i was looking at
[03:41:11.520 --> 03:41:16.880]  pictures actually alex jones had a big event in a freedom festival i think he called it and at the
[03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:25.120]  rnc people go are you going to the info wars uh freedom event i guess so no disrespect alex this
[03:41:25.120 --> 03:41:30.400]  is just to show everybody's growing and how new i am to all this i'm so new to politics and journalism
[03:41:30.400 --> 03:41:35.520]  that i even know who the big players were and i went to this event and i thought wow this was a lot
[03:41:35.520 --> 03:41:39.040]  roger's phone was there a lot of great people were there speaking and i was looking at pictures
[03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:45.040]  feeling nostalgic and then i thought look how far we've come in a year right everybody talks about
[03:41:45.040 --> 03:41:51.520]  oh cnn does cnn have ratings and whatever look at what alternative media has done
[03:41:52.560 --> 03:42:00.560]  since rnc alex is now a folk hero alex did the most listen to podcast and joe rogan history
[03:42:00.560 --> 03:42:06.400]  over 50 000 live viewers that's a that's a football stadium that is you know madison
[03:42:06.400 --> 03:42:13.120]  square garden times two that is bigger than anything amy schumer or south rogan or any of
[03:42:13.120 --> 03:42:19.440]  the deviant debased debased pop icons are ever going to get that's rock star status this alex
[03:42:19.440 --> 03:42:26.000]  jones just another podcast with joe rogan by far the biggest podcast of all time and we're still
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:32.080]  growing they're now doing you know memes at jones everybody's growing and that is why again i know
[03:42:32.080 --> 03:42:37.840]  people who listen a lot of times people feel disconnected nicely and that is a sign up on the
[03:42:37.840 --> 03:42:44.240]  media a very and it relates to a very very sad story from the washington post about people who
[03:42:44.240 --> 03:42:52.080]  are on disability now and many rural communities people are now on disability even though they
[03:42:52.080 --> 03:42:56.960]  can work and when you read the article it's very sad because the people are hopeless and many of
[03:42:56.960 --> 03:43:03.120]  these areas and the reason they're hopeless is they watch the television if you watch tv you're
[03:43:03.120 --> 03:43:08.240]  going to feel hopeless if you read the washington post of the new york times or cnn or any of these
[03:43:08.240 --> 03:43:12.880]  other nihilistic websites where they only want to preach misery and decay and decadence and
[03:43:13.440 --> 03:43:19.360]  pedophilia normalization and i give platforms to pedophiles and child pornographers and everything
[03:43:19.920 --> 03:43:24.640]  people feel completely demoralized because they don't have alternative media think about
[03:43:24.640 --> 03:43:30.720]  what if rural america we're we're listening to alex jones every day we're we're on info wars
[03:43:30.720 --> 03:43:35.920]  dot com and we're listening to my periscopes they wouldn't feel hopeless anymore if we control the
[03:43:35.920 --> 03:43:40.960]  radio airwaves and the world if we were the ones rural america was listening to people who feel
[03:43:40.960 --> 03:43:46.720]  hopeful they would feel inspired how can how can people listen every day and not feel inspired
[03:43:46.720 --> 03:43:52.800]  and know that we are we're hitting them hard that's the real reason they hate us the media
[03:43:52.800 --> 03:43:57.520]  wants you to moralize they want you on disability and by the way i know there are people who
[03:43:57.520 --> 03:44:03.280]  legitimately have disabilities so this is certainly not a knock on people who have legitimate problems
[03:44:03.280 --> 03:44:09.200]  or have legitimate struggles nothing but compassion from everybody of course you know part of the
[03:44:09.200 --> 03:44:14.160]  whole team everybody nothing but production of hearts definitely go out to anybody who's ever
[03:44:14.160 --> 03:44:18.800]  been legitimately through a hardship a lot of these people though they just don't have any jobs
[03:44:19.920 --> 03:44:24.720]  and they don't have any hope and then they develop depression and then they go on disability for that
[03:44:24.720 --> 03:44:30.400]  and then they can't work and then there's a cycle the mindset of course if you have a bad mindset
[03:44:30.400 --> 03:44:35.760]  it can create actual physical sickness has been proven that if you think negative thoughts
[03:44:35.760 --> 03:44:41.040]  then your body will decay it will get sick so if you convince yourself in your own mind
[03:44:41.040 --> 03:44:46.720]  they should stick then you're going to be sick so right between 1996 and 2015 the number of
[03:44:46.720 --> 03:44:52.320]  working age adults receiving federal disability pains increase significantly rural america
[03:44:52.320 --> 03:45:01.440]  hardest hit you know you never hear that when they talk about the employment rate right if
[03:45:01.440 --> 03:45:07.920]  they go oh unemployment's down obama cured the economy well people on disability aren't counted
[03:45:08.720 --> 03:45:13.280]  as being unemployed this is the way that they manipulate the statistics so under obama
[03:45:14.800 --> 03:45:18.800]  these people couldn't find jobs because the globalists gave them all away the globalists
[03:45:18.800 --> 03:45:23.520]  gave all the jobs away and allowed all these companies to move over these other countries
[03:45:24.240 --> 03:45:29.440]  hide trillions of dollars in wealth offshore 20 25 trillion dollars i believe is offshored
[03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:35.280]  they allowed these big global corporations to do it the jobs all went away people felt hopeless
[03:45:35.280 --> 03:45:39.920]  and then obama they go my god what are we going to do so he met with the fake news people at
[03:45:39.920 --> 03:45:46.080]  CNN the new york times and other places and they go well what we'll do is we'll get these people
[03:45:46.080 --> 03:45:51.680]  on disability and then what we'll say is well they're not unemployed and then of course these
[03:45:51.680 --> 03:45:57.200]  fact-checking websites went after trump because during the the campaign trump said that unemployment
[03:45:57.200 --> 03:46:02.880]  was actually close to 20 percent the fake news media goes oh fact check for pinocchios he's so
[03:46:02.880 --> 03:46:07.360]  wrong it's only six percent obamas the greatest jobs president in the history of the world and
[03:46:08.320 --> 03:46:15.040]  no talk about people who could work if they had hope and if the globalist corporations
[03:46:15.040 --> 03:46:22.720]  hadn't taken the jobs all the way and if unskilled workers had been imported into drive down wages
[03:46:22.720 --> 03:46:29.840]  and to keep wages suppressed then the unemployment would be 20 percent it would be that way but that
[03:46:29.840 --> 03:46:35.520]  is why we're fighting back that is why trump is bringing jobs back the media doesn't want you to
[03:46:35.520 --> 03:46:42.080]  tell john spicer doesn't want to tell where where why why do people listening not know
[03:46:42.080 --> 03:46:48.320]  how many hundreds of thousands of jobs that has been created under trump the info wars talks about
[03:46:48.320 --> 03:46:55.120]  it david night does oan alex well the team leon you know people um milley they talk about it of
[03:46:55.120 --> 03:47:01.520]  course but why isn't spicer doing that why didn't he ever think every time there was a more job
[03:47:01.520 --> 03:47:07.760]  creation why wasn't he doing major events major celebratory events letting people know to feel
[03:47:07.760 --> 03:47:14.560]  hopeful to feel inspired he was too busy talking about this russia stuff the russia conspiracy
[03:47:14.560 --> 03:47:19.680]  theories too busy answering emails from the new york times and the washington post and all these
[03:47:19.680 --> 03:47:24.160]  other websites and blogs that wanted to show him that's all spicer did so stare moochie
[03:47:25.920 --> 03:47:29.920]  he gives people hope people go why do you like stare moochie so much he's correct charismatic
[03:47:29.920 --> 03:47:37.120]  and that is what america needs right now america is in an age of spiritual bankruptcy by design
[03:47:37.120 --> 03:47:42.640]  there are charismatic high-energy people on the right people who believe in freedom people
[03:47:42.640 --> 03:47:47.440]  like me people like gallops people like all the great people are in info wars stare moochie
[03:47:47.440 --> 03:47:51.680]  the media doesn't want people like that on their show so the media doesn't want people like joe
[03:47:51.680 --> 03:47:58.640]  pollock who went on to cnn he's a bright part guy very smart guy crushed the entire cnn panel
[03:47:58.640 --> 03:48:02.880]  they don't invite people who are actually charismatic and influential and persuasive
[03:48:02.880 --> 03:48:09.760]  what they do as a sign up on the people as they invite the biggest dorks the low-energy people
[03:48:09.760 --> 03:48:13.200]  the stupid people and they go look at these people like national review they'll bring on
[03:48:13.200 --> 03:48:20.560]  somebody from national review national review isn't even relevant so what they do is they bring in
[03:48:20.560 --> 03:48:26.720]  people from national review who are complete dorks and then they have them on but when you have
[03:48:26.720 --> 03:48:31.600]  somebody joe pollock on with bryan stelter pollock crushes them so they don't ever want that guy on
[03:48:31.600 --> 03:48:36.080]  again they don't want legitimate intellectuals on the right or legitimate intellectuals on bryan
[03:48:36.080 --> 03:48:41.680]  bar on their tv shows because then that sends a message to the people that the best ideas are not
[03:48:41.680 --> 03:48:47.200]  coming from the fake news media you're not going to get a good idea watching cnn you're not going
[03:48:47.200 --> 03:48:52.080]  to get a good idea reading the new york times of the washington post you want intelligent people
[03:48:52.720 --> 03:48:57.600]  on so they put on the dummies they put on the losers they put on people like national review
[03:48:57.600 --> 03:49:03.280]  who who go after trump and oppose america people like kevin williamson of national review who wrote
[03:49:03.280 --> 03:49:08.320]  an article saying that he believes that rural communities deserve to die direct quote you
[03:49:08.320 --> 03:49:14.240]  can find the article national review so you read an article from the washington post about how people
[03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:20.560]  are suffering they're depressed they're despondent they're hopeless and then you have people in the
[03:49:20.560 --> 03:49:26.240]  national review saying that those people their communities deserve to die what about saving
[03:49:26.240 --> 03:49:31.200]  their community what about rebuilding churches what about rebuilding optimism what about
[03:49:31.200 --> 03:49:37.040]  no holding rallies for america and and helping lift people up and spreading an uplifted message
[03:49:37.040 --> 03:49:41.680]  and a positive message you'll never read that national review they say oh i want those people to
[03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:46.720]  die and decay yeah forget all your cheap theatrical bruce springsteen crap forget your
[03:49:46.720 --> 03:49:51.760]  sanctimony about struggling rust belt factory towns that's in the national review these people
[03:49:51.760 --> 03:49:58.000]  are suffering american people are suffering and the national review says good they all deserve
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:03.280]  to die these communities deserve to die who cares about these people that's the mainstream
[03:50:03.280 --> 03:50:10.320]  conservative line and that is the line amplified by the fake news media to make everybody who's
[03:50:10.320 --> 03:50:15.920]  a real american not like these fake americans on the on the news who hate hate the country
[03:50:15.920 --> 03:50:19.680]  and say they were never proud of america like michelle obama had said i was i was never proud

[03:54:15.040 --> 03:54:22.560]  your host mike sernovich we have a little bit of disturbing news a great news story that we're
[03:54:22.560 --> 03:54:28.560]  developing in the bbc of course talked about right away i was tipped off by a reader about a
[03:54:28.560 --> 03:54:34.160]  network of pedophiles the rapper on periscope there was a video of a child she was fully clothed
[03:54:34.160 --> 03:54:39.280]  but it looked like she was unattended and there are people saying you know show me your your body
[03:54:39.280 --> 03:54:45.120]  parts and everything so we are we are investigating we are investigating this right now there are
[03:54:45.120 --> 03:54:50.880]  definitely a pedophiles all over periscope you can see the comments show your your skirt very very
[03:54:50.880 --> 03:54:57.920]  very sick stuff so what appears to be happening is that children from um maybe homes where they
[03:54:57.920 --> 03:55:02.800]  don't have the proper supervision they're going on periscope and pedophiles there's a huge pedophile
[03:55:02.800 --> 03:55:09.280]  ring down and we've warned about it before as a matter of fact that was a media i tried to to mock
[03:55:09.280 --> 03:55:16.000]  alex and me when we did a segment on how deep state black males people by roofing them and they
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:20.400]  only want pedophiles in deep state and then of course the very next day of story breaks so they
[03:55:20.400 --> 03:55:25.440]  try to it's funny they try to make fun of us and they go oh you know jones and cernovich we're talking
[03:55:25.440 --> 03:55:31.280]  about these deep state pedophiles look at them conspiracy theory blah blah blah blah and then
[03:55:31.280 --> 03:55:37.200]  the very next day isn't that interesting the the rest of the media catches up to where we are so
[03:55:37.200 --> 03:55:42.080]  there are these open pedophile networks on periscope so if you are watching periscope and you do see
[03:55:42.720 --> 03:55:49.040]  a pedophile like commentary screen cap it we need to do a whole project i mean we need to do
[03:55:49.040 --> 03:55:54.880]  you we need to do something about this i i you know i can't sit by i'm surprised that bbc even
[03:55:54.880 --> 03:56:00.240]  covered this you know i guess the bbc they're so they're they're realizing they're losing and
[03:56:00.240 --> 03:56:04.320]  they covered up for jimmy saville and other pedophiles for so long that and they covered up
[03:56:04.320 --> 03:56:10.400]  rotherham until you know 1300 young girls are raped i guess they realized that the people know
[03:56:10.400 --> 03:56:15.600]  now that the media has been covered up pedophilia and they better do something about it they better
[03:56:15.600 --> 03:56:21.040]  actually have some coverage so i applaud the bbc for finally actually reporting on all these
[03:56:21.040 --> 03:56:25.920]  pedophiles on the internet even though it must be very hard because a lot of people in media are
[03:56:25.920 --> 03:56:29.920]  connected with this kind of stuff and these kind of people which is a very very unfortunate thing
[03:56:29.920 --> 03:56:34.800]  but we got to clean up media we got to clean up hollywood so i don't know we have to do something
[03:56:34.800 --> 03:56:40.880]  about this i was sent this in a periscope i posted the tweets they're saying follow me back show me
[03:56:40.880 --> 03:56:47.840]  your essentially your underwear um they talking about fees it's very disgusting actually it was
[03:56:47.840 --> 03:56:54.240]  chilling god bless all of the the brave federal agents who their job is to actually monitor this
[03:56:54.240 --> 03:57:00.640]  stuff i was i felt drained it was like a spiritual vampire had connected to me when i just seen
[03:57:00.640 --> 03:57:05.520]  these comments knowing that there are people like this so god bless the law enforcement the feds who
[03:57:05.520 --> 03:57:10.320]  actually investigate this kind of stuff and we actually want to fight it and god bless the people
[03:57:10.320 --> 03:57:15.760]  in media the few people in media who actually cover the stuff rather than make fun of people like me
[03:57:15.760 --> 03:57:20.640]  and alistair trying to expose it i mean yeah unbutton sure it's just so vile you know if you
[03:57:20.640 --> 03:57:24.640]  want if you're watching this if you're listening on the radio they're saying you know what is your
[03:57:24.640 --> 03:57:32.400]  cup size to children five years old six years old that's what they're doing so why does the media
[03:57:32.400 --> 03:57:37.200]  and it's heartbreaking why do they make fun of alex and i and craig storyer and you know millie has
[03:57:37.200 --> 03:57:44.240]  done reports on it why do they attack us for for reporting on this why do they attack us for telling
[03:57:44.240 --> 03:57:49.040]  the truth or blowing the whistle for trying to actually protect children from all these perverts
[03:57:49.040 --> 03:57:53.920]  and and pedophiles and everybody online why do they cover up for people like anthony weiner
[03:57:53.920 --> 03:57:58.880]  and try to pretend like he is not a lifetime registered sex offender because he exchanged
[03:57:58.880 --> 03:58:03.200]  naked pictures with underage girl why do they not want to talk about jacob schwarz who worked for
[03:58:03.200 --> 03:58:08.640]  bill deblasio and jacob schwarz have been a guest on seeing him multiple times why do they attack us
[03:58:09.520 --> 03:58:15.440]  for blowing the whistle on this that's the real question asked and in my opinion they're attacking
[03:58:15.440 --> 03:58:20.800]  us says a lot about their motivations and about the real people that they work for the true people
[03:58:21.360 --> 03:58:26.800]  behind the curtain thanks for tuning in we're going to go after we're going to hit them back
