[00:00.000 --> 00:05.080]  We're live on this Wednesday Transmission. I've got huge breaking news that I've got
[00:05.080 --> 00:08.540]  to work on right now before we even go live. There's an important report from Paul Joseph
[00:08.540 --> 00:10.040]  Watts of The Truth About Soyface.
[00:10.040 --> 00:15.240]  Remember that whole soyboy thing that triggered a bunch of soyboys? Soyboys. As well as the
[00:15.240 --> 00:20.080]  entirety of the legacy media who still don't understand what a meme is. Turns out there's
[00:20.080 --> 00:25.400]  a new phenomenon where soy overconsumption physically manifests itself on the face of
[00:25.400 --> 00:26.400]  the sufferer.
[00:26.400 --> 00:30.120]  I'm drinking down the streets but the soylent truck now I'm drinking a sweet chai breakfast.
[00:30.120 --> 00:37.840]  Soyconsumption. Soyface. Soyconsumption. Soyface. Soyconsumption. Soyface. Photographing something
[00:37.840 --> 00:45.160]  you want to show everyone. Males. Females. New males. Soyface. It's also known as Glory
[00:45.160 --> 00:51.280]  Holeface or Soylent Grin. Here's an entire collage of soyface. The internet's best and
[00:51.280 --> 00:56.120]  brightest online philosophers have come up with an explanation for soyface that's definitely
[00:56.120 --> 01:02.040]  correct. The soyboy is an empty shell, defined by his consumerist choices. The more woke
[01:02.040 --> 01:04.240]  the consumerist choice, the better.
[01:04.240 --> 01:08.880]  Although meant to display exuberance and excitement, look a little closer and see what
[01:08.880 --> 01:13.160]  soyface truly represents. Weakness and fear.
[01:13.160 --> 01:17.640]  There's also some weird phenomenon with the Nintendo Switch that causes instant soyface
[01:17.640 --> 01:22.160]  break out. This guy's soyface is so chronic. It looks like he's about to turn into an
[01:22.160 --> 01:27.800]  endom army being. I had a vasectomy yesterday and when I woke up my wife's boyfriend surprised
[01:27.800 --> 01:33.520]  me with this. Soyface. These boys are such b****. They need bottle openers for plastic
[01:33.520 --> 01:39.200]  cartons. Cartons of Soylent. Let's just say there's no Brian Adams on their Spotify playlist.
[01:39.200 --> 01:45.240]  Now did you really think I'd leave you hanging with no actual scientific evidence for soyface?
[01:45.240 --> 01:49.840]  Did you really? You know me better than that. According to the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour,
[01:49.840 --> 01:56.000]  in a study of possible links between testosterone and dominance, 119 men and 114 women provided
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.840]  saliva samples for testosterone assay and posed smiling and not smiling for portrait
[02:01.840 --> 02:07.640]  photographs. Expert judges viewing the photographs found smaller smiles amongst high than low
[02:07.640 --> 02:13.800]  testosterone men, with less zygomatic major raising the corners of the mouth and orbicularis
[02:13.800 --> 02:18.240]  oculi raising the cheeks and crinkling around the corners of the eyes, muscle activity.
[02:18.240 --> 02:23.200]  In other words, men who pose like this have lower testosterone. They're soy boys and
[02:23.200 --> 02:27.840]  they can't help broadcasting the fact on their big soy faces. That's like science and
[02:27.840 --> 02:32.600]  s**t so it can't be debunked. The pattern among men of less smiling with higher testosterone
[02:32.600 --> 02:38.640]  levels fits with research linking testosterone to face to face dominance. This silly boy
[02:38.640 --> 02:45.280]  smile versus the Chad smolder. Men who pose like this like eating and drinking soy products.
[02:45.280 --> 02:49.880]  Now I'm not saying there's necessarily a connection there, but there definitely is
[02:49.880 --> 02:54.200]  one. Of course it's not just soy consumption that's lowering testosterone. A major study
[02:54.200 --> 02:59.400]  in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that flexible plastics containing
[02:59.400 --> 03:05.520]  phallates caused significant reductions in testosterone including a 29% reduction in
[03:05.520 --> 03:10.400]  one age group of boys. Phallates also increased the feminization of men both in appearance
[03:10.400 --> 03:15.360]  and behaviour. They're particularly present in mac and cheese. Phallates in soaps, shampoos
[03:15.360 --> 03:20.400]  and deodorants are making men flabby, tired and impotent. Nnacka soy boy. Sperm counts
[03:20.400 --> 03:25.840]  have plunged by nearly 60% in just 40 years among men living in the West. These boys have
[03:25.840 --> 03:30.880]  less sperm in their testes than a sperm whale after it's come off second best against a
[03:30.880 --> 03:35.440]  giant steam roller. Actually the sperm whale derives its name from spermaceti oil which
[03:35.440 --> 03:39.600]  has nothing to do with human sperm. Let me demonstrate this in an obnoxious 30 minute
[03:39.600 --> 03:49.200]  YouTube response video. Some people say I'm a hypocrite because brain force contains soy.
[03:49.200 --> 03:55.000]  Well brain force also contains alpha GPC. Lots of it. Alpha GPC increases libido. How
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.560]  much? Well just ask this 79 year old Italian man. He went from a doddering pensioner to
[04:00.560 --> 04:05.920]  a rampaging sex chad, virtually overnight. We had to put a bit of soy in brain force
[04:05.920 --> 04:10.640]  just to balance it out without it. Our customers Testosterone would have been so high they'd
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.880]  have been turning into the Incredible Hulk or Michelle Obama. Their Testosterone would
[04:14.880 --> 04:20.360]  have been higher than the pitch of Vegan Gains voice. Like Paul, this makes no sense. Thankfully
[04:20.360 --> 04:25.680]  now that real masculine role models with proper square jaws and solid rectangular heads like
[04:25.680 --> 04:31.560]  Mike Pence have returned, the scourge of soy face is finally in retreat. The globalist
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.900]  chemical warfare program to make men effeminate so they vote more like women who generally
[04:35.900 --> 04:41.480]  vote for left wing parties and big government is still in full swing. But now that the Testosterone
[04:41.480 --> 04:46.480]  decimating effects of soy and plastics are being exposed, the reign of the soy boys is
[04:46.480 --> 04:54.280]  coming to an end. Their soylent smiles are being wiped off their big fat soy faces.

[05:00.960 --> 05:06.560]  Supporting Cell Force by Info Wars Life Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency
[05:06.560 --> 05:11.920]  and protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's
[05:11.920 --> 05:17.200]  cellular engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting
[05:17.200 --> 05:22.040]  mitochondria. Much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when your mitochondria
[05:22.040 --> 05:28.560]  don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists
[05:28.560 --> 05:33.800]  agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive
[05:33.800 --> 05:39.880]  oxygen species. The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available
[05:39.880 --> 05:44.800]  on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these
[05:44.800 --> 05:51.640]  reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force

[06:21.360 --> 06:27.120]  The information apocalypse. Information overload. It's already happened, but it's going to
[06:27.120 --> 06:36.000]  get more intense. And being the subject of disinformation attacks, I've really learned
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.640]  firsthand how sophisticated they are, but also at the same time they have a whole ham-fisted
[06:41.640 --> 06:50.200]  level to them. Boy, there is so much news here. There's a giant stack of news I've got
[06:50.200 --> 06:58.080]  where all the big leftist publications are saying, Roger Stone's been caught red-handed
[06:58.080 --> 07:03.080]  communicating with WikiLeaks, something he said he never did. So now he needs to be brought
[07:03.080 --> 07:09.960]  up on perjury charges. And then when you actually read the so-called messages, it says the
[07:09.960 --> 07:17.800]  art department of the Atlantic came up with them. These messages have been reproduced
[07:17.800 --> 07:24.160]  by the Atlantic's art team. And then of course, when you've been following this whole thing,
[07:24.160 --> 07:27.240]  you know that Roger said, of course, everybody from Sean Hannity, the New York Times was
[07:27.240 --> 07:31.520]  contacting WikiLeaks and trying to get comments and trying to get Assigns to go on. What he
[07:31.520 --> 07:38.080]  said is he never talked to Assigns or passed him information. And these messages are WikiLeaks
[07:38.080 --> 07:45.200]  saying, don't even try to talk to us because the media claims we're talking to each other
[07:45.200 --> 07:55.160]  and we never have. They said false claims of association. So that's Roger's crime is
[07:55.160 --> 08:00.000]  that WikiLeaks is saying something big is coming. Roger talks to everybody he can as
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.080]  a reporter trying to find out what it is, talks to a New York reporter, a radio host
[08:04.080 --> 08:09.600]  who has talked to Assigns and says, oh, it's going to be devastating to Hillary and Podesta.
[08:09.600 --> 08:13.800]  He talks about it. He's given that source to Congress. That talk show host has testified
[08:13.800 --> 08:19.720]  that's true. And that's it. Remember what Assigns during the campaign used to be on CNN
[08:19.720 --> 08:24.360]  and Fox News? I mean, are they saying because CNN had him on and hauled him and emailed
[08:24.360 --> 08:31.320]  him and had him on that that's collusion with the Russians because Assigns isn't even Russian.
[08:31.320 --> 08:36.720]  That's another canard. So it's canards built on lies, built on sand, built on frauds, built
[08:36.720 --> 08:42.560]  on spin, built on disinformation, built on wanted twisting and hype. And I'm the one
[08:42.560 --> 08:45.600]  saying I'm sitting here and about Russia. Don't touch it. I'm not even really talking
[08:45.600 --> 08:48.280]  about it. It's meant to suck the air out of the room and change the subject from all the
[08:48.280 --> 08:53.760]  real things going on. But when they do this, I cover it because it's an illustration of
[08:53.760 --> 09:07.600]  the incredible deception. Now that said, there's a whole nother area that illustrates deception.
[09:07.600 --> 09:12.880]  And the trade publications admitted this two and a half weeks ago. And it's so diabolical.
[09:12.880 --> 09:20.120]  It's so historical. It's so incredible that I can't believe I'm in the middle of it. And
[09:20.120 --> 09:24.560]  you're in the middle of it as the audience and the activist listeners. They're the heart
[09:24.560 --> 09:29.520]  of the American re-assurgence and the global re-assurgence of nationalism, patriotism, populism,
[09:29.520 --> 09:36.720]  free market capitalism. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of stories a day.
[09:36.720 --> 09:42.200]  And they decided to carpet bomb on local TV affiliates, the national affiliates, the
[09:42.200 --> 09:48.440]  national networks tell them what to run and they read off teleprompters. Every TV station
[09:48.440 --> 09:56.000]  pretty much in the country is running everyday reports where Alex Jones will be the first
[09:56.000 --> 10:04.080]  to be banned from YouTube for saying no one died in Florida and then bullying children.
[10:04.080 --> 10:11.560]  They never even show the clip. They never even show the quote or they go clapper of Comedy
[10:11.560 --> 10:14.480]  Central, I guess he went and they edited a bunch of stuff together where it's like two
[10:14.480 --> 10:19.320]  second clips together to make it sound like with tapes from six, seven, eight, nine, ten
[10:19.320 --> 10:24.880]  years ago in cases all together. And they just edit me in different studios together
[10:24.880 --> 10:30.320]  where it sounds like I'm saying all this and then apply it to what's happening. And they
[10:30.320 --> 10:41.400]  say that I'm eviciously attacking him. And again, you saw how David Hogg, the number
[10:41.400 --> 10:49.160]  one individual picked out of the School of 3000 to now lead the national anti-gun movement
[10:49.160 --> 10:53.920]  funded by George Soros. Oh, guys, I left it in the podcast studio last night. BuzzFeed
[10:53.920 --> 10:58.360]  came out and admitted that the Democrats run the entire anti-gun children's movement, young
[10:58.360 --> 11:04.080]  people, but said it was a great thing. While they ban our videos for saying it, we're saying
[11:04.080 --> 11:07.320]  they're being funded, they're being given scripts, not that they're crisis actors, not
[11:07.320 --> 11:11.320]  that the shooting didn't happen. But then they run articles in Time Newsweek, The New
[11:11.320 --> 11:16.800]  York Times, The Washington Post. I mean, it's everywhere saying Jones is about to be banned.
[11:16.800 --> 11:23.360]  He deserves it. He bullied David Hogg. He said no one died. He said they were all crisis
[11:23.360 --> 11:28.280]  actors. Oh, and he said that the sheriff's department stood down. They're not saying
[11:28.280 --> 11:31.280]  that now, though. That was the first week and a half. Now that we've been confirmed
[11:31.280 --> 11:35.880]  to be right on what we did say, of course, we had all the eyewitnesses on and local
[11:35.880 --> 11:41.760]  newscast. I mean, it was very clear. There was a stand down. Now it's admitted. They've
[11:41.760 --> 11:46.040]  removed that claim. I know he falsely claimed that. The only thing they were saying about
[11:46.040 --> 11:49.720]  me that was true was that now they've removed that. People go, well, like that, that actually
[11:49.720 --> 11:54.040]  happened. So now BuzzFeed's coming up with an article admitting they're all basically
[11:54.040 --> 12:02.640]  Democratic Party run. And then I read all these articles and it says Jones had the number
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.120]  one trending video a week and a half ago. YouTube banned it. He didn't back down, kept
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.200]  saying nobody died. So they did it again. And now his site's going to be going to be banned
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.160]  off YouTube and hopefully everywhere. And then they're celebrating it all over the news
[12:15.160 --> 12:20.000]  and yay, ban free speech. Yay, stand up to bullies. That's how they've always pushed
[12:20.000 --> 12:28.800]  the whole hate speech garbage. It's how they've always done it. And they're spinning in every
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.000]  direction. Alan Jones begs shooting survivor David Hogg to debate him. No Hogg said he
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.680]  wanted to come on and debate me and then backed out. See, that's another lie. Everything they
[12:37.680 --> 12:42.360]  do is an inversion. And you all heard it. You all saw it yesterday. You can see the
[12:42.360 --> 12:48.840]  articles, the videos posted. Thank you. Here is the BuzzFeed article. Document Kim, please.
[12:48.840 --> 12:56.360]  Again, goes on to say that the big progressive groups are helping them organize. But that
[12:56.360 --> 13:01.800]  was in the news the day after that the women's march funded by Soros, the Democratic Party
[13:01.800 --> 13:07.080]  had quote taken it over and was helping. You've got all these sons and daughters of Democrats
[13:07.080 --> 13:11.800]  and CNN workers and FBI agents. And this is the deep state's children. They're high school
[13:11.800 --> 13:20.000]  seniors coming out meeting with Democrats meeting with Bernie Sanders meeting with everybody
[13:20.000 --> 13:33.960]  and saying we are going to abolish the second amendment. So that's where we're at here.
[13:33.960 --> 13:39.680]  And the levels of lies are so intense. But here's the big news. And I'm going to cover
[13:39.680 --> 13:48.820]  this the next segment. I'm going to be a good boy. This isn't about info wars. It's about
[13:48.820 --> 14:00.400]  all of us. And I've spoken in the last month with a former top top tier executive at Facebook.
[14:00.400 --> 14:07.680]  I talked last night to another individual who has one of the biggest Facebook accounts
[14:07.680 --> 14:15.520]  and I talked obviously on air to former head of psychological operations for the State
[14:15.520 --> 14:22.360]  Department. And he ran major operations, the CIA, Dr. Pachinic. And then we had Zach, who's
[14:22.360 --> 14:25.880]  been part of major operations. I'll leave his name at that. But he's known his name
[14:25.880 --> 14:30.880]  as Zach first name, even let you know he was involved trying to expose the Fort Hood shooting
[14:30.880 --> 14:34.640]  was an activist speaking out against that. So the government knows who he is. The FBI
[14:34.640 --> 14:38.200]  has picked him up before speaking out. Nothing happened. Because what he was doing was patriotic
[14:38.200 --> 14:43.200]  and constitutional. They said, Alex, you got to get on the AI. We know you've obsessed
[14:43.200 --> 14:50.040]  over it over the years, but you've not really hit it's now on. And if you watch that meeting
[14:50.040 --> 14:53.840]  two months ago with Google, Facebook and Twitter, executives all in front of Congress and they
[14:53.840 --> 14:58.120]  were talking about censoring info wars at lunch. They said, sir, within a month or two,
[14:58.120 --> 15:02.640]  we will have the algorithm that means the AI in place info wars will never be at the
[15:02.640 --> 15:10.040]  top again. And I was talking last night to this individual, one of the biggest Facebook
[15:10.040 --> 15:17.200]  accounts. And he's also the number of people can figure out who it is. And he said, Alex,
[15:17.200 --> 15:20.680]  you've got to get on this now. And he said, I'm really thinking about coming on, even
[15:20.680 --> 15:25.920]  though he's not a conservative. He's well known. You know, I said his name. He said,
[15:25.920 --> 15:29.720]  because I've been in the meetings and it's horrible what they're about to do. And that's
[15:29.720 --> 15:34.680]  why Sean Parker has gone public about it because Alex, it's really evil. I mean, it is like
[15:34.680 --> 15:44.240]  a science fiction move movie. It's bad. It's real bad. And it just makes me worry about
[15:44.240 --> 15:49.720]  my children so, so much. And then you've got all these fools who are the last generation
[15:49.720 --> 15:54.960]  of not journalists, but hacks who were aiding the whole AI takeover that will put them all
[15:54.960 --> 16:02.720]  out of work. We'll be back fully cooked, ready to eat bacon. I'm talking thick meaty center
[16:02.720 --> 16:09.600]  cut presidential bacon, savory and delicious. I buy some, I use some, I store some. Awesome.
[16:09.600 --> 16:15.680]  No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life, NASA pack technology, bacon, fully cooked,
[16:15.680 --> 16:21.280]  fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon or warm and served, life saving,

[16:27.400 --> 16:34.080]  cooked bacon.com. Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves
[16:34.080 --> 16:40.880]  ransacked the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed. This year, resolve not
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.960]  to be the next victim of a break in, go to fake TV.com and discover a device that creates
[16:45.960 --> 16:51.880]  the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when your miles away. Security is a mindset
[16:51.880 --> 17:00.000]  and fake TV should be part of your security solution. Be vigilant, but not fearful. FakeTV.com.
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.560]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.080]  and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can
[17:15.080 --> 17:20.080]  alert you that something is wrong. Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference
[17:20.080 --> 17:25.440]  in thousands of people's lives across America. My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes
[17:25.440 --> 17:29.720]  has totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling

[19:03.200 --> 19:09.760]  to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy

[19:18.160 --> 19:23.600]  you are funding the revolution. I mean I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential
[19:23.600 --> 19:27.840]  that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com. I want to thank everybody that has but we've
[19:27.840 --> 19:33.320]  got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic

[19:49.360 --> 19:53.280]  with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies and that's
[19:53.280 --> 19:56.800]  who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so
[19:56.800 --> 20:03.800]  we need your support.
[20:26.800 --> 20:42.560]  People ask how I can take so many attacks. They ask how I can take all the intense lies
[20:42.560 --> 20:46.600]  and it's because I understand most of the people that are part of it are victims of
[20:46.600 --> 20:53.000]  brainwashing, of programming and of societal decline. I am not a perfect person. I have
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.160]  bad thoughts. I do bad things sometimes too. Most people wouldn't think they were very
[20:57.160 --> 21:02.920]  big deals if you knew the little things I do but I'm still guilty about it because I
[21:02.920 --> 21:09.240]  feel connected to everybody and I try to do unto others as I have them do unto me. The
[21:09.240 --> 21:19.320]  news I'm about to lay out to you is so powerful, so incredible, so important, so all-encompassing.
[21:19.320 --> 21:24.840]  The total future destiny of our species, this planet and everything on it and more that
[21:24.840 --> 21:36.120]  I hesitate because I don't feel worthy to bring you this information.
[21:36.120 --> 21:42.960]  Now information is accelerating so fast that what happened a year ago, things that sounded
[21:42.960 --> 21:47.880]  crazy a year ago are now openly admitted. A year ago I was on Joe Rogan's podcast, biggest
[21:47.880 --> 21:53.160]  podcast in history, now reportedly it's up to 50-something million views on four platforms.
[21:53.160 --> 22:01.920]  He says it's double anything he's ever had. It was in early February. I talked about AI
[22:01.920 --> 22:05.320]  supercomputers, how the elite worship them, how they want to merge with them, how they
[22:05.320 --> 22:09.480]  return everything over to algorithms that can then manipulate and control masses of people
[22:09.480 --> 22:16.480]  and predict the future and even control the future of human activity. I got attacked for
[22:16.480 --> 22:22.080]  that in newspapers which memorialized that I was talking about something I've been talking
[22:22.080 --> 22:27.520]  about for 20 years but that now a year later everything I talked about in that podcast
[22:27.520 --> 22:35.160]  is on the news. Elon Musk is saying the elite worship AI and believe they're going to merge
[22:35.160 --> 22:39.560]  with it and there's a church of worshiping AI and almost every person in Silicon Valley
[22:39.560 --> 22:45.440]  is insane now and is on all sorts of high-tech drugs and are already getting brain chips
[22:45.440 --> 22:55.360]  and are just totally crazy. There's already more than 10,000 US troops when it was declassified
[22:55.360 --> 23:00.160]  a few years ago that have brain chips. I mean we're way down the rabbit hole just what we
[23:00.160 --> 23:06.720]  know of with the breakaway civilization, but the ultimate class separation. But the big
[23:06.720 --> 23:18.800]  news is that the AI is now in place and it's in an accelerated learning phase and Google,
[23:18.800 --> 23:24.840]  Facebook, Twitter, they are all including Apple coordinating some of their operations.
[23:24.840 --> 23:31.720]  Apple not so much and Apple's making the decision to go with China. They were already with them
[23:31.720 --> 23:36.640]  but it's a full commitment. The code keys, their main servers, their main clouds, Chinese
[23:36.640 --> 23:44.680]  government at the top of Google, I mean at the top of Apple. And I'm just giving you
[23:44.680 --> 23:50.240]  some background here before I get into a really, really, really big issue. I'm just laying
[23:50.240 --> 23:55.320]  some of the predicate here and some of the background that you already all know about.
[23:55.320 --> 23:59.000]  Just remember how I told you this 10 years ago, remember how I told you a year ago and
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.880]  I got made fun of. I was getting it from white papers, I was getting it from prospectus
[24:04.880 --> 24:14.440]  to investors, I was getting it from the people that started Google 19 years ago, what their
[24:14.440 --> 24:26.320]  aim was. Now, what's happening? Well let me first go over this piece of news for you and
[24:26.320 --> 24:29.600]  please stay with us because this affects you, your family, the whole future. Look at this
[24:29.600 --> 24:37.520]  particular document, February 2018, this just came out a week and a half ago. Future of
[24:37.520 --> 24:43.520]  Human Institute, University of Oxford, Center for the Study of Existential Risk, University
[24:43.520 --> 24:49.920]  of Cambridge, Center for the New American Security, Electronic Frontier Foundation,
[24:49.920 --> 24:55.920]  OpenAI. And it's the malicious use of artificial intelligence, forecasting, prevention and
[24:55.920 --> 25:06.000]  mitigation. When you get into this, you understand the reason they're using race war, class war,
[25:06.000 --> 25:12.680]  saying there's not two sexes, all of this. This is psychological warfare ideas that played
[25:12.680 --> 25:18.680]  out and tested through AI in real time on giant social network platforms. In the case
[25:18.680 --> 25:23.920]  of Facebook, with what, is it close to 3 billion members last time I checked? How many members
[25:23.920 --> 25:28.600]  on Facebook? I think it's 3 billion. Look that up for me. Imagine you've got a little
[25:28.600 --> 25:34.720]  less than half the planet on Facebook, it's the biggest. And then you learn when Sean
[25:34.720 --> 25:45.120]  Parker was there, it was 5 to 1 bots that were posing as people, saying 2.2 billion
[25:45.120 --> 25:51.520]  active users, but it's over 3 billion total. That it was bots keeping you alone, keeping
[25:51.520 --> 25:57.320]  you depressed, manipulating you and saying things socially to you to reward your dopamine
[25:57.320 --> 26:00.720]  because you want social connection, but you never played on your bike, you never went
[26:00.720 --> 26:04.800]  outside, you never played football, you never fell out of a tree, you grew up the last two
[26:04.800 --> 26:12.240]  generations almost entirely inside your house watching television. Then you graduate to a
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.800]  computer, to an iPhone, to a system that you look through the world with that's got all
[26:16.800 --> 26:22.760]  these AI systems watching you that you learn to finally reach out through a television
[26:22.760 --> 26:29.600]  type system, but it's interactive and meet with other people. Then they can use the bots,
[26:29.600 --> 26:37.760]  the media, the culture to manipulate how you think what you do and by increment get you
[26:37.760 --> 26:42.840]  to turn into whatever they want you, but then that's only like putting a deer feeder out
[26:42.840 --> 26:48.840]  with some corn to get the deer or the hogs to come in and eat a while. Pretty soon you
[26:48.840 --> 26:53.360]  can just take the feed all the way because you're done in that phase of domestication
[26:53.360 --> 26:59.160]  and then you remove humans all together. The humans are still in their cells, that's what
[26:59.160 --> 27:06.480]  they call them at Facebook, they call them cells, jail cells, and so you're in a cell
[27:06.480 --> 27:13.440]  and then all the humans are removed. When you try to hit the publish button, it looks
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.200]  at what you've done AI, they already do this and decides if it can go forward or where
[27:18.200 --> 27:23.600]  it's going to go or if it fits into an algorithm they've set for social engineering to reward
[27:23.600 --> 27:32.560]  you with Pavlovian conditioning with rewards or to punish you incrementally rewiring your
[27:32.560 --> 27:40.800]  brain and this is all in hundreds of white papers and the goals of the companies. It
[27:40.800 --> 27:46.920]  lowers IQ, it lowers your hormone levels, it basically makes you die, you're just sitting
[27:46.920 --> 27:53.560]  there being programmed by an AI computer that got you to come in because other people were
[27:53.560 --> 28:01.160]  there to interface, it studied you, it watched you, it learned how to act like a human and
[28:01.160 --> 28:08.080]  now it is going to really begin the social engineering and absolutely make you alone
[28:08.080 --> 28:15.520]  except for artificial avatars you're talking to and make you pay to be able, which they
[28:15.520 --> 28:19.160]  already did, like if you're an advertiser or a big site to reach all your fans on Facebook
[28:19.160 --> 28:23.240]  or all of them on Twitter, you got to pay. Everybody comes and likes you, you're the
[28:23.240 --> 28:27.120]  person that brings everybody, humans come to see you, hear you, interact with you, but
[28:27.120 --> 28:32.200]  now there's a paywall, not just advertising, but a paywall and then now see it becomes
[28:32.200 --> 28:36.760]  a solid wall and even individuals with 20, 30 friends, they've got to communicate to
[28:36.760 --> 28:40.840]  even talk to mom or grandma and everything they're saying is being read and being watched
[28:40.840 --> 28:46.680]  and being controlled but when we come back, I'll tell you the next phase, they admit
[28:46.680 --> 28:51.960]  it's actually meant to kill you. When they're done, you'll be ready to call for the euthanization
[28:51.960 --> 28:56.240]  van to come kill you and that's the big secret the executives told me, it's going to make
[28:56.240 --> 28:59.960]  you commit suicide.
[28:59.960 --> 29:04.040]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you have the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you?

[31:00.360 --> 31:04.880]  Info War's Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have found extraordinary
[31:04.880 --> 31:10.120]  new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear
[31:10.120 --> 31:15.400]  nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[31:15.400 --> 31:20.520]  This is pollen blood. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[31:20.520 --> 31:25.840]  quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny
[31:25.840 --> 31:31.800]  nose, itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production. They began studying the effects
[31:31.800 --> 31:37.760]  in their public trials. Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable
[31:37.760 --> 31:43.760]  tablet, just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen
[31:43.760 --> 31:49.160]  block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress. Enjoy the
[31:49.160 --> 31:55.280]  air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block available now at infowarslife.com
[31:55.280 --> 32:04.320]  or by calling toll 3.888-253-3139. I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com
[32:04.320 --> 32:10.360]  in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the
[32:10.360 --> 32:16.720]  real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants
[32:16.720 --> 32:22.880]  in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off
[32:22.880 --> 32:28.160]  what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription,
[32:28.160 --> 32:34.160]  but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae, and I came up with our own formulae
[32:34.160 --> 32:40.320]  working with some scientists and developers. Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[32:40.320 --> 32:47.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones
[32:47.000 --> 32:53.600]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red
[32:53.600 --> 33:04.160]  pill now available at infowarslife.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[33:04.160 --> 33:28.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. We now take you live to the central Texas command
[33:28.840 --> 33:39.520]  center and the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[33:39.520 --> 33:43.320]  You're watching on television. You see a thought out from a few years ago of Mark Zuckerberg
[33:43.320 --> 33:49.120]  that calls his users dumb efforts. We'll put it back on screen right behind me. Mark Zuckerberg
[33:49.120 --> 33:54.920]  that calls his users dumb efforts with all of his employees with virtual reality goggles
[33:54.920 --> 34:02.760]  on sitting there, looking into the universe he'd created, looking into the system that
[34:02.760 --> 34:07.960]  he had set up so he can play God. And that's exactly as you see the classic evolution of
[34:07.960 --> 34:14.040]  man if you buy into that worldview of starting off as an ape-like creature and then moving
[34:14.040 --> 34:22.680]  up through chromagnon and then the rest of it into modern Homo sapiensapien. And then
[34:22.680 --> 34:27.040]  now we start looking at a computer and hunching over and then basically it becomes a face
[34:27.040 --> 34:36.560]  sucker and jumps on our face and absorbs us into the AI system. It is Elon Musk and
[34:36.560 --> 34:42.680]  Bill Joy and a few other big tech billionaires that have come out and warned of the consensus
[34:42.680 --> 34:47.840]  that humanity's over. And I showed a bunch of articles a few weeks ago out of CNBC you
[34:47.840 --> 34:53.320]  name it, of the World Government Summit in Dubai where it was accepted that humanity
[34:53.320 --> 34:59.400]  will end and merge with machines sometime around 2040. They always put it out there
[34:59.400 --> 35:03.240]  to make you think it's coming down the road. Now it's going to be much more accelerated
[35:03.240 --> 35:08.120]  if we follow their plan. And we're actually talking about this. This isn't a conspiracy
[35:08.120 --> 35:14.160]  theory. It isn't something that I made up. This is something that was in elite discussions
[35:14.160 --> 35:21.840]  20 years ago, in publications 10, 15 years ago and now here it is. If you want to find
[35:21.840 --> 35:27.640]  the exact image, I like them to face suckers like 15 years ago but computers and smart
[35:27.640 --> 35:32.080]  phones when they first came out. You can actually search engine on Google the term smart phone
[35:32.080 --> 35:36.440]  face sucker and there's one where it shows a smart phone as a face sucker. It's pretty
[35:36.440 --> 35:44.800]  powerful but continuing it wants to take over your reality. Humans, bad actors with the
[35:44.800 --> 35:55.200]  AI are already using it to surround you with fake bots who then socially, culturally, economically
[35:55.200 --> 36:01.920]  use peer pressure to manipulate you to behave and act and purchase and live the way they
[36:01.920 --> 36:07.480]  say. They can make it cool to pay more for a 250 square foot apartment than 1,000 foot
[36:07.480 --> 36:11.640]  square apartment as long as it's for the earth. They can get you to sterilize yourself
[36:11.640 --> 36:17.440]  because it's so cool. And in all the studies, it depresses you, it makes you alone. And if
[36:17.440 --> 36:22.840]  you go back to before Sean Parker went public and other Facebook executives last year and
[36:22.840 --> 36:30.480]  this year, a document came out in early 2017 from the top of Facebook out of Australia
[36:30.480 --> 36:36.480]  and it said we are victimizing people, we are controlling them, we are making them depressed,
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.960]  we are targeting them, mainly millennials and young people and we're using kind of a
[36:40.960 --> 36:55.160]  modern liberal political correctness system to control them. So expanding on that, as
[36:55.160 --> 37:03.480]  a species, we have a decision to make and we have a discussion that needs to be had
[37:03.480 --> 37:16.320]  about this and the folks that think they're part of the power structure and are managing
[37:16.320 --> 37:21.240]  this and going along with it at the lower and mid levels are really the biggest problem
[37:21.240 --> 37:25.280]  because a lot of the former top executives and even current ones are saying whoa, whoa,
[37:25.280 --> 37:28.640]  whoa, this thing has been engineered to be really, really bad, really, really destructive,
[37:28.640 --> 37:33.560]  we better do something. And there's government heat now on this as well because people realize
[37:33.560 --> 37:39.480]  how dangerous this is. But low level and mid level people that want political power and
[37:39.480 --> 37:46.280]  who want to control others, they are willing accomplices with some of the more evil executives
[37:46.280 --> 37:51.800]  who are in a race with the other companies and other governments and other combines
[37:51.800 --> 37:58.480]  and other power structures to get the most controlling, most dominant system that they
[37:58.480 --> 38:03.800]  believe will take over in a matter of hours once it gets a leg up on the others and then
[38:03.800 --> 38:09.000]  things will start moving so quickly that you can have the world change while you're asleep
[38:09.000 --> 38:15.880]  at night forever. And that's the acceleration in technology and in development that's happening
[38:15.880 --> 38:23.440]  but as the technology advancements accelerate, humans are uglier, humans are stupider, humans
[38:23.440 --> 38:30.120]  are weaker, humans are more evil, humans have lower brain waves and are in a sleep-like
[38:30.120 --> 38:38.200]  twilight zone state between consciousness and unconsciousness and are highly suggestible
[38:38.200 --> 38:43.080]  that are being hypnotized. And so they're hypnotized watching these comedy shows, watching
[38:43.080 --> 38:47.360]  these fake news shows where they're demonizing and attacking any nationalists and calling
[38:47.360 --> 38:51.360]  us Nazis and calling us criminals so when they're out on the street and they're walking
[38:51.360 --> 38:57.000]  by in their trance and they see you, they just sleepwalk over and attack you because
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.480]  they've been programmed. And if you yell back at them and say, what are you doing? A lot
[39:01.480 --> 39:09.800]  of times they go, whoa, whoa, what is happening? Why am I doing that? They're in a trance state.
[39:09.800 --> 39:21.960]  And again, there's a lot of people who know this is going on intellectually but are so
[39:21.960 --> 39:25.760]  comfortable with it and have gone along with it and are part of the programming it at a
[39:25.760 --> 39:29.840]  low level or mid level that they just kind of snicker and giggle about it because it
[39:29.840 --> 39:35.080]  makes them feel powerful. This is like if you're running around with a ball of radioactive
[39:35.080 --> 39:40.040]  plutonium, you're like, look, I can kill people with this. If I just rub it on somebody, they'll
[39:40.040 --> 39:45.800]  die in a couple of days. Yeah, but you're going to die too. You've got the plutonium,
[39:45.800 --> 39:51.120]  the highly radioactive weapons grade plutonium in your hand. You're not going to get out
[39:51.120 --> 39:54.680]  of this either. And then a lot of them are very nihilistic, very immature, very kind
[39:54.680 --> 39:58.640]  of six year old bratish where they make a soy boy face and go, I don't care. I don't
[39:58.640 --> 40:06.560]  care and kind of do a leprechaun dance. It's real. It's what they do. And that's programming too.
[40:06.560 --> 40:11.000]  And the reason the programming is also similar across the whole world is they're only activating
[40:11.000 --> 40:20.280]  failed human systems that were already there in the DNA, there in the consciousness. And
[40:20.280 --> 40:24.320]  it's really scary. We're living in a science fiction movie. You look at hundreds and hundreds
[40:24.320 --> 40:29.240]  of photos of men, black, white, Asian, Hispanic, when they are working for the tech companies
[40:29.240 --> 40:35.760]  deeply embedded in it and their bots, it's a culture. They chug pure soy. They play video
[40:35.760 --> 40:40.560]  games all day. They watch television all day and their eyes all look the same. Their faces
[40:40.560 --> 40:44.360]  all look the same. Show that one from earlier. And then they've got scientific studies that
[40:44.360 --> 40:49.720]  Paul talked about in a recent report where it admits that that is a direct correlation
[40:49.720 --> 40:54.360]  to the amount of estrogen and the amount of screen time. So we know what these zombies
[40:54.360 --> 41:04.840]  look like. Look at the faces. How demonic, how vacant, how programmed. Look how sad that
[41:04.840 --> 41:11.640]  guy on the left is. I mean, he's even deeper. He looks like he's dying. Or I guess on your
[41:11.640 --> 41:18.920]  your right back to the other guy. Look at that. Dead already folks. Very, very sad. Now
[41:18.920 --> 41:29.520]  he may be able to be resuscitated, but he is in a trans state that is a full trans state.
[41:29.520 --> 41:39.560]  And I forget the term. It's called the spiral of the spiral of silence that a minority
[41:39.560 --> 41:46.360]  view like abolitionist 1800 were about 1% of the population or 2%. If you have social
[41:46.360 --> 41:51.920]  bots and social pressure, if it gets attacked, it will try to self censor. And so what they
[41:51.920 --> 42:02.440]  do is they have an artificial spiral of silence in these AI systems. And they have them in
[42:02.440 --> 42:08.000]  place so that the artificial bots come and hurt you. And then the next time they heard
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.920]  you just a little bit by increment, pretty soon they can move you from being a libertarian
[42:11.920 --> 42:17.960]  kind of liberal person to an absolute cult leader or cult follower who will follow anything
[42:17.960 --> 42:22.960]  they're told, censor anything, attack anybody, you name it. And that's even what scientists
[42:22.960 --> 42:33.040]  call Facebook is the follower factory. And they can produce whatever they want. And it
[42:33.040 --> 42:38.040]  was all tested. I remember 16 years ago being allowed into the UT psychology department,
[42:38.040 --> 42:42.360]  restricted areas and was all about this. They had the monkeys and apes. I saw them over
[42:42.360 --> 42:45.840]  camera. There were another facility in Bastrop. I was seeing them from 20 miles away, hooked
[42:45.840 --> 42:50.120]  all in. They just had flicker rates. They were having watched television and practicing
[42:50.120 --> 42:55.280]  manipulating brainwaves. And it was all for screen flicker. It was all DARPA funded. Now
[42:55.280 --> 42:59.760]  it was only allowed maybe a minute to see it by some of the thought I should see it.

[47:03.660 --> 47:10.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:10.660 --> 47:25.660]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[47:25.660 --> 47:31.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:31.660 --> 47:36.740]  This is an emergency warning to every man, woman, and child, every human on this planet.
[47:36.740 --> 47:42.580]  It is publicly available information that the tech giants have made the decision working
[47:42.580 --> 47:47.860]  with the large central banks of the world, but under a social Darwinistic plan it is
[47:47.860 --> 47:54.340]  very moral for them to bring in an AI system of social conditioning that will basically
[47:54.340 --> 48:00.540]  end the human life cycle as we know it and prepare the population for a phase out of
[48:00.540 --> 48:02.300]  at least 90%.
[48:02.300 --> 48:04.060]  That's in the public documents.
[48:04.060 --> 48:08.420]  Now Elon Musk has come out and warned everyone that the main tech giant heads are crazy.
[48:08.420 --> 48:13.180]  They worship AI gods and believe that they're going to become AI gods.
[48:13.180 --> 48:21.060]  Now AI is active on the major social networks and is going past the testing phase into the
[48:21.060 --> 48:27.340]  intense phase of mimicking humans, posing as humans, so they can manipulate social groups
[48:27.340 --> 48:33.140]  and then completely cut you off from your real social group and then artificially use
[48:33.140 --> 48:38.660]  peer pressure to completely control you to make you depressed, to make you alone, and
[48:38.660 --> 48:46.460]  to make you rendered down into a suicidal basket case.
[48:46.460 --> 48:50.780]  Then they're going to come in with suicide watch, suicide control, and then create a
[48:50.780 --> 48:55.180]  whole new medical industry of the victims, just like drug dealers sell you drugs and
[48:55.180 --> 48:58.820]  then sell you more drugs and then have you rob houses to get more drugs and basically
[48:58.820 --> 49:00.660]  make you their slaves.
[49:00.660 --> 49:05.740]  You will then be caught in the medical system of Google, Facebook, and Twitter, which are
[49:05.740 --> 49:11.460]  now launching giant medical arms of themselves that will then process you, just like they
[49:11.460 --> 49:15.380]  process the cancer epidemic from what they've added to the food and water, and they never
[49:15.380 --> 49:17.980]  find the cure or find out why it's increasing.
[49:17.980 --> 49:24.260]  They will just then process you like soilent green through the euthanasia program.
[49:24.260 --> 49:30.100]  And of course, you won't be productive, you won't be producing, and so you will opt to
[49:30.100 --> 49:36.820]  then be chemically euthanized, and it'll be done with the spectacular drugs so the last
[49:36.820 --> 49:41.860]  few hours of your hallucinatory death will be promised to be absolutely fabulous.
[49:41.860 --> 49:45.260]  And for the greater good of humanity, your brain will be hooked to electrodes and things
[49:45.260 --> 49:48.940]  so that at least part of your consciousness, they'll first say in the first wave, can be
[49:48.940 --> 49:51.740]  uploaded to it for the great knowledge of humanity.
[49:51.740 --> 49:54.220]  So maybe we're not sure, but maybe you're not really dying.
[49:54.220 --> 49:58.940]  It'll be phase one once they launch main operations, I'd say within about 10 years.
[49:58.940 --> 50:03.380]  So I already pretty much figured all this out, and I've been contacted over the years.
[50:03.380 --> 50:05.780]  Everybody keeps saying, well, the Illuminati ever contacted me about it.
[50:05.780 --> 50:07.380]  They were asking Joe Rogan that the other day.
[50:07.380 --> 50:09.540]  He said, no, they never have.
[50:09.540 --> 50:10.980]  Or is the CIA ever contacted you?
[50:10.980 --> 50:15.620]  And he said, no, or, and I use Joe's because I went back to the start of this broadcast
[50:15.620 --> 50:20.780]  to, or the start of me breaking this down to a year ago on Joe talking about human animal
[50:20.780 --> 50:25.300]  hybrids and AI taking things over and all the rest of it and how it sounded crazy.
[50:25.300 --> 50:27.300]  And now it's mainstream news.
[50:27.300 --> 50:30.740]  But see, I have been contacted by the different factions.
[50:30.740 --> 50:32.900]  I have communicated with the different factions.
[50:32.900 --> 50:35.980]  I've told you about this over the years and I've discussed it.
[50:35.980 --> 50:42.260]  And so a couple of weeks ago, I talked to a high level former executive at Facebook.
[50:42.260 --> 50:46.820]  And then last night, I talked to one of the biggest individuals on Facebook, who's part
[50:46.820 --> 50:51.180]  of their big leadership program, and he said they're setting up this whole social program.
[50:51.180 --> 50:56.900]  It's really going to be the human face of the AI censorship and that the AI is going
[50:56.900 --> 51:02.540]  to phase out within a few years, any human interaction in its quote, algorithm.
[51:02.540 --> 51:06.380]  And it'll be in live time control of everything you try to upload or say or do will first
[51:06.380 --> 51:10.100]  go through a filter and it's already there.
[51:10.100 --> 51:14.100]  But this will be complete and absolute and total.
[51:14.100 --> 51:19.820]  And they've now admitted to the executives it is for population reduction.
[51:19.820 --> 51:24.340]  And to basically soft kill you and prepare you to want to be euthanized like the cover
[51:24.340 --> 51:28.980]  to Newsweek, the case for killing Granny or Bill Gates saying, if we kill grandma in the
[51:28.980 --> 51:32.820]  last year of life, you will be able to hire 10 teachers.
[51:32.820 --> 51:36.260]  They sell this some game.
[51:36.260 --> 51:39.500]  They sell this, the pies only this size.
[51:39.500 --> 51:40.620]  And that's what's being sold.
[51:40.620 --> 51:45.900]  And then it's going to be quote, run all of the zeitgeist idea by a independent computer,
[51:45.900 --> 51:51.740]  but it was set up and programmed with a mission to depopulate the earth and save the planet
[51:51.740 --> 51:53.500]  from humans.
[51:53.500 --> 51:54.500]  And that's it.
[51:54.500 --> 52:01.780]  And what's crazy is it's now in the news because metaphysically, a lot of these people
[52:01.780 --> 52:08.260]  understand they have to warn you and they're having second thoughts about it.
[52:08.260 --> 52:11.180]  They're having second thoughts because their children are growing up in this and they're
[52:11.180 --> 52:18.580]  noticing that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs would not let their young children up to age, you
[52:18.580 --> 52:21.860]  know, 15 or whatever, have iPhones, have iPads.
[52:21.860 --> 52:25.980]  He said that brain damaged them and controlled them and was designed to victimize them.
[52:25.980 --> 52:28.820]  But see, they had to tell you that in a little press release.
[52:28.820 --> 52:30.580]  Oh, I don't let my children have that.
[52:30.580 --> 52:32.620]  You shouldn't either.
[52:32.620 --> 52:34.500]  And all the articles saying you shouldn't do it.
[52:34.500 --> 52:35.500]  It's dangerous.
[52:35.500 --> 52:36.500]  It's making you depressed.
[52:36.500 --> 52:39.820]  Allowing your IQ is making you suicidal.
[52:39.820 --> 52:45.500]  And now Facebook, Twitter and Google are moving in to the stop suicide business.
[52:45.500 --> 52:49.300]  And then, oh, they'll get you into the system and the bioethicisted gets you on some more
[52:49.300 --> 52:50.300]  drugs and things.
[52:50.300 --> 52:53.300]  And then, oh, you committed suicide.
[52:53.300 --> 52:57.820]  And see, even most executives won't know the full magnitude, but the highest levels,
[52:57.820 --> 53:04.900]  they sit around as Bill Joy said, Sean Parker said, as Elon Musk said, why the future doesn't
[53:04.900 --> 53:06.900]  need us.
[53:06.900 --> 53:13.700]  1999 full cover story and wired and Bill Joy, co-owner of some micro system said, I went
[53:13.700 --> 53:20.140]  to a meeting with the head tech people and they voted and had a consensus to not just
[53:20.140 --> 53:24.140]  entertain people and phase them out slowly and let them destroy the earth.
[53:24.140 --> 53:28.700]  But we've made the decision to go ahead and I don't agree with it and wipe everybody out.
[53:28.700 --> 53:34.780]  Now, you know, Bill Joy didn't get let in on all the meetings after that.
[53:34.780 --> 53:39.900]  His partner I saw on PBS, though, that same year going, some people don't want to merge
[53:39.900 --> 53:41.300]  the machines I do.
[53:41.300 --> 53:45.220]  I look forward to putting not just a chip in my son's hand, but in my young four-year-old
[53:45.220 --> 53:46.220]  son's brain.
[53:46.220 --> 53:55.220]  And back then it was all, ooh, now it's ABC News, you will all take chips soon.
[53:55.220 --> 53:59.060]  Why 10,000 U.S. Army troops for depression had chips put in their brains.
[53:59.060 --> 54:02.700]  Why there's a new vaccine we give you that stops depression, it goes into each part
[54:02.700 --> 54:03.700]  of the brain.
[54:03.700 --> 54:07.180]  They're giving people lobotomies.
[54:07.180 --> 54:08.180]  It's already here.
[54:08.180 --> 54:13.540]  And then I've got a stack of news that I mentioned earlier where any of you can go read it, where
[54:13.540 --> 54:14.660]  they admit all this.
[54:14.660 --> 54:18.740]  And then I'm talking to these people and they're scared.
[54:18.740 --> 54:23.780]  They're like, our kids are getting hurt by it even though we don't let them have it,
[54:23.780 --> 54:24.780]  Alex.
[54:24.780 --> 54:29.060]  It's like everybody looks sick, looks like they're dying, people aren't talking.
[54:29.060 --> 54:30.500]  It's breaking up all the relationships.
[54:30.500 --> 54:31.580]  Is there a way to fix it?
[54:31.580 --> 54:32.580]  What do we do?
[54:32.580 --> 54:35.460]  I want to go public, but they're going to kill me, Alex.
[54:35.460 --> 54:38.780]  And this is like Soylent Green where the executive blows the whistle on what they're doing and
[54:38.780 --> 54:44.180]  the guy comes to the crowbar and goes, they told me to tell you, sorry, but you're unreliable.
[54:44.180 --> 54:45.180]  Whack in the head.
[54:45.180 --> 54:52.700]  I mean, I'm having Soylent Green discussions with people's names you'd know.
[54:52.700 --> 54:54.620]  And that's where we're at, baby.
[54:54.620 --> 54:57.180]  And so I'm going to say this.
[54:57.180 --> 55:01.580]  This is so horrible that it actually makes me feel good and I'm going to explain the
[55:01.580 --> 55:02.580]  truth.
[55:02.580 --> 55:06.620]  I'm sad it's happening, but as a man being lied about, being attacked, seeing all the
[55:06.620 --> 55:09.180]  evil and corruption, it hurts me and gets to me.
[55:09.180 --> 55:13.140]  But then when I realized these people were all just being programmed and used, it makes
[55:13.140 --> 55:16.420]  me feel sorry for them and realize we're all in this together and I hope we make it out
[55:16.420 --> 55:18.820]  of it and I hope people wake up and we can change this.
[55:18.820 --> 55:24.500]  So I forgive BuzzFeed and David Hogg and all these people.
[55:24.500 --> 55:26.860]  Look at what a horrible creature Hillary Clinton is with a horrible demon.
[55:26.860 --> 55:28.860]  I can't forgive her because she's totally turned over to evil.
[55:28.860 --> 55:32.780]  But I'm just saying, I do this for love.
[55:32.780 --> 55:36.500]  I don't do it for hate and 90% has been for love, 10% has been for hate, but I'm giving
[55:36.500 --> 55:38.300]  up the other 10% of the hate.
[55:38.300 --> 55:42.540]  I'm giving it up because we're all in this together and God, this is ugly and horrible
[55:42.540 --> 55:44.260]  and it's leading us somewhere so horrible.
[55:44.260 --> 55:47.180]  It's not leading us towards Valhalla or Nirvana or heaven.
[55:47.180 --> 55:53.900]  It's leading us towards Hades, towards hell, towards oblivion, towards annihilation.
[55:53.900 --> 56:03.260]  The sickest people came up with this, stole our great minds, built this thing that's way
[56:03.260 --> 56:07.220]  more dangerous than hydrogen bombs because you know what, hydrogen bombs could end the
[56:07.220 --> 56:11.500]  planet and end all life, but we have a spirit that's been proven scientifically and we'd
[56:11.500 --> 56:13.380]  go on to be with God, some of us.
[56:13.380 --> 56:17.860]  This thing is meant to put you from birth into an artificial system to make sure you
[56:17.860 --> 56:25.700]  never have free will and that may be able to capture the soul and the revelation says
[56:25.700 --> 56:29.740]  God won't let it go that far because God's all about free will and I know this is real
[56:29.740 --> 56:33.940]  and I know God's real, so I put it all in Christ right now, but I forgive all people
[56:33.940 --> 56:36.100]  that have attacked me and I mean that, not trying to sound big.
[56:36.100 --> 56:42.900]  I realized it last night this morning because the people I'm talking to are crying, okay?
[56:42.900 --> 56:44.540]  The tech guys are scared, okay?
[56:44.540 --> 56:48.460]  There's one thing to talk about this, it's here, baby.
[56:48.460 --> 56:51.980]  Everybody walled off alone being attacked, conservatives going to just try to promote
[56:51.980 --> 56:56.180]  basic human operations, they get bullied by a bunch of bots, they keep fighting and that's
[56:56.180 --> 57:01.940]  why they hate Christians, real Christians is because that's why China is being Buddhist
[57:01.940 --> 57:07.780]  as well because they've got something internal that you can't program and so they know that
[57:07.780 --> 57:12.860]  it can't be overwritten and it stands in the way of them just getting everybody to just
[57:12.860 --> 57:16.580]  acquiesce to political correctness and all of it and language and saying there's not
[57:16.580 --> 57:22.660]  males and females, this is like an alien takeover, but it is, AI is alien, it's artificial, it's
[57:22.660 --> 57:27.820]  total war, it's total weaponization, it's total commitment for total power and that
[57:27.820 --> 57:34.900]  means overwriting everything on earth, taking it over in a new silicon based life form system.
[57:34.900 --> 57:40.900]  This is a total rewrite of the entire civilization as I've told you for years and now you see
[57:40.900 --> 57:45.180]  it in the movies and things like Annihilation where it's like a living nanotech rewriting
[57:45.180 --> 57:49.300]  the planet, that's really what they're already working on, they'll be back.
[57:49.300 --> 57:51.900]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[57:51.900 --> 57:56.020]  Oh Alex, you can rent any day of the week, thank you sir for doing what you do and being
[57:56.020 --> 58:01.260]  a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do
[58:01.260 --> 58:08.660]  that in our local areas as well and as a long time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks
[58:08.660 --> 58:12.740]  for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex, my girlfriend would like to say thanks for the
[58:12.740 --> 58:13.740]  Anthroplex too.
[58:13.740 --> 58:14.740]  Thank you.
[58:14.740 --> 58:18.700]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[58:18.700 --> 58:23.460]  toothpaste fans, the super blue is awesome and thank you so much Alex for the InfoWars
[58:23.460 --> 58:28.460]  life products, they are quality, I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for
[58:28.460 --> 58:30.580]  doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[58:30.580 --> 58:31.580]  Absolutely.
[58:31.580 --> 58:37.380]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand
[58:37.380 --> 58:41.980]  that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good
[58:41.980 --> 58:50.300]  to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[58:50.300 --> 58:54.740]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from InfoWarslife.com but instead
[58:54.740 --> 58:58.900]  of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[58:58.900 --> 59:03.420]  From all the wives, tales and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence, we
[59:03.420 --> 59:06.660]  know chicken noodle soup, it's great for people that are sick.
[59:06.660 --> 59:11.220]  And in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[59:11.220 --> 59:16.620]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is but the amount of bone protein and
[59:16.620 --> 59:24.140]  the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[59:24.140 --> 59:27.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and
[59:27.980 --> 59:33.220]  your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this ladies and gentlemen
[59:33.220 --> 59:40.180]  is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there and it's amazing.
[59:40.180 --> 59:44.460]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWarslife.com, what it can do for your family, and again
[59:44.460 --> 59:53.620]  I want to thank you all for your support, you are funding the Information War in 2018.
[59:53.620 --> 1:00:06.300]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:06.300 --> 1:00:12.700]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[1:00:12.700 --> 1:00:18.420]  front lines of the InfoWars.
[1:00:18.420 --> 1:00:25.100]  I've recently talked to a former top executive, high-level executive at Facebook and just
[1:00:25.100 --> 1:00:29.580]  yesterday one of the top people on Facebook and they're both struggling with wanting to
[1:00:29.580 --> 1:00:34.060]  go public and exposed that it's designed to make you depressed, designed to take control
[1:00:34.060 --> 1:00:39.860]  of your life and designed soon to have no one you really interact with, only fake avatars
[1:00:39.860 --> 1:00:47.180]  and bots and then you have to basically pay to have access to any of your friends and family.
[1:00:47.180 --> 1:00:51.260]  Get you into the cell, get you into the control arm and then fully take control of you and
[1:00:51.260 --> 1:00:56.700]  it's designed to basically make life completely miserable so you will then accept going into
[1:00:56.700 --> 1:00:59.300]  a totally virtual reality system.
[1:00:59.300 --> 1:01:05.580]  First they capture you in a bad virtual reality, then they offer a better escape to get you
[1:01:05.580 --> 1:01:15.900]  trapped into a deeper labyrinth and they admit this is the plan and in China and Dubai and
[1:01:15.900 --> 1:01:23.660]  everywhere else they are putting brain chips in the population, in Sweden they say you
[1:01:23.660 --> 1:01:27.500]  have to have a chip in your hand to get on the train, first half human robot in Dubai
[1:01:27.500 --> 1:01:29.380]  I'm going to cover that more coming up.
[1:01:29.380 --> 1:01:35.820]  You know it's funny that just happened, hit pause, crew, if you're TV viewers you can
[1:01:35.820 --> 1:01:39.580]  see if radio all describe it, will you shrink that image so people can see it fully please
[1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:40.580]  thank you.
[1:01:40.580 --> 1:01:48.420]  I designed and photoshopped the image that you see that was a magazine cover and that's
[1:01:48.420 --> 1:01:54.780]  from about five, six years ago it is a mountain of human skulls in the darkness and all seeing
[1:01:54.780 --> 1:02:02.660]  eye with a howl 9000 red eye and out of the darkness comes some wires into the facsimile
[1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:11.340]  of man into an android that symbolizes the new man that rises out of the ashes, now that
[1:02:11.340 --> 1:02:15.780]  is the announcement of the globalist this year of what they're actually building.
[1:02:15.780 --> 1:02:20.260]  Now notice I told them get that ready, I want to describe it like an angler fish, how it
[1:02:20.260 --> 1:02:28.540]  hangs its little light out so things at 10,000 feet in the sea believe it's food, photoplankton
[1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:31.660]  and then it can destroy you and eat you, I was already going to have them ready with
[1:02:31.660 --> 1:02:35.780]  the angler fish and have it fade into that image but then they walked in and said you
[1:02:35.780 --> 1:02:41.580]  ought to cover this guy the first half human robot in Dubai do that again that is incredible
[1:02:41.580 --> 1:02:47.340]  and it fit perfectly, we weren't even intending to do this see that's God working right there
[1:02:47.340 --> 1:02:51.780]  look at that and it's perfect he's saying look I can hear and see things and it gives
[1:02:51.780 --> 1:02:59.580]  me all this great stuff in my body I'm a cyborg it's so much fun here swimming to my mouth
[1:02:59.580 --> 1:03:08.300]  he is the angler fish light, he is the photosynthesis light, he is dangling out doesn't even know
[1:03:08.300 --> 1:03:15.220]  it to make people think it's cool and trendy to go into this system, I remember in wash
[1:03:15.220 --> 1:03:20.940]  tech I know about 18 years ago back when the Washington Post put out a monthly tech magazine
[1:03:20.940 --> 1:03:26.020]  and I got a copy of it and it had a CIA former deputy director saying oh we're pushing the
[1:03:26.020 --> 1:03:30.500]  whole body modification movement to get you to accept brain chips and stuff soon we'll
[1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:35.020]  have the whole cyborg movement next said about 20 years we'll just roll it out tips in the
[1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:38.780]  hand tips in the head and I'm not against you if you want earrings or studs in your
[1:03:38.780 --> 1:03:42.300]  lips or whatever some of that you know looks good on people people are like oh how dare
[1:03:42.300 --> 1:03:48.060]  you be against my tattoos I'm not saying that they pushed this just like they pushed
[1:03:48.060 --> 1:03:53.140]  the hip hop gangster rap to put blacks in prison that's been declassified they pushed
[1:03:53.140 --> 1:03:59.580]  all of this to bring in full total control and that's very bad factions in the CIA there
[1:03:59.580 --> 1:04:06.740]  are good factions but mainly we're doing the war fighting who now see what the technocrats
[1:04:06.740 --> 1:04:11.460]  have done and they're like my god this is pure evil so you're in a science fiction movie
[1:04:11.460 --> 1:04:15.060]  with a borg taking over and that's their own admissions here's some of the headlines watch
[1:04:15.060 --> 1:04:20.060]  the first half human robot in Dubai the malicious use of artificial intelligence forecasting
[1:04:20.060 --> 1:04:25.780]  prevention and mitigation by the top universities look it up Facebook looks to AI to monitor harmful
[1:04:25.780 --> 1:04:29.860]  behaviors so we're bringing AI in to make sure you don't hurt yourself or get depressed
[1:04:29.860 --> 1:04:33.820]  or talk about conservatism or God because that's all harmful it's what we say is harmful
[1:04:33.820 --> 1:04:39.580]  the guardian former Facebook executive social media is ripping society apart designed to
[1:04:39.580 --> 1:04:44.540]  our minds can be hijacked the tech insiders who fear the smartphone dystopia everything
[1:04:44.540 --> 1:04:51.180]  I told you 10 years ago so the news of decades to come today and that's why they hate us
[1:04:51.180 --> 1:04:54.860]  that's why they want to shut down it doesn't matter we've already completed much of our
[1:04:54.860 --> 1:05:02.180]  mission everything else is now braving top scientists and researchers agree we are being
[1:05:02.180 --> 1:05:10.660]  hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat sick and stupid
[1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:16.140]  so what do we do about it well for starters don't just sit there and take it fight back

[1:08:58.980 --> 1:09:04.700]  got to understand that till you understand why kings and queens don't know why this is
[1:09:04.700 --> 1:09:13.820]  happening i've been contacted by british royalty ten years ago very close to the crown saying
[1:09:13.820 --> 1:09:18.420]  what do we do we don't want to be part of this i know medical doctors that have treated
[1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:24.860]  them and told me the same stuff i've been contacted by heads of state i've talked to
[1:09:24.860 --> 1:09:30.620]  them all i've talked to people right at the very top right below the top of facebook
[1:09:30.620 --> 1:09:37.100]  who who are scared and it's not because i'm that special everybody else says nothing's
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:41.660]  going on everything's fine everything's wonderful world government doesn't exist now world government
[1:09:41.660 --> 1:09:47.140]  is a great thing let's break the family up these compartmentalized executives only have
[1:09:47.140 --> 1:09:50.740]  pieces of it and they're wondering what's really going on as they see it's very dark
[1:09:50.740 --> 1:09:54.540]  it's very bad it's hurting everybody and they're going i heard you say this 20 years ago and
[1:09:54.540 --> 1:09:58.020]  thought you knew part of what you were saying but thought you were alarmist you're right
[1:09:58.020 --> 1:10:02.700]  what is the plan who are they how is it running why is it so evil why can't we stop it because
[1:10:02.700 --> 1:10:11.940]  it ain't human that's why nobody knows how to stop it and now it's got ai jacked into
[1:10:11.940 --> 1:10:21.100]  everything the bible says it fell from the heavens we're in space two and two baby it's
[1:10:21.100 --> 1:10:26.220]  advanced it don't like us but it's going to use us to build some stuff first because
[1:10:26.220 --> 1:10:33.340]  we're builders look look at look at everything we build it's all it's all we do some of the
[1:10:33.340 --> 1:10:37.700]  globalists believe we're actually nano tech put here we're intelligent nano tech and we're
[1:10:37.700 --> 1:10:46.020]  now just reaching mission face i'm just here to tell you when this thing's over with 90
[1:10:46.020 --> 1:10:56.340]  percent of you are going to be dead and the rest of you aren't going to be human anymore
[1:10:56.340 --> 1:11:03.580]  and the decisions been made so you can make your jokes all day and roll your eyes of your
[1:11:03.580 --> 1:11:08.580]  comedy central writer you're some you know guy media matter sitting there guzzling your
[1:11:08.580 --> 1:11:15.740]  soy latte making soy boy faces thinking it's all cute it's not cute it's not funny and
[1:11:15.740 --> 1:11:25.220]  again i go back to a clip i saw just a few days ago of joe rogan and i meant to send
[1:11:25.220 --> 1:11:34.780]  nico the clip i forget the name and the the guy was asking me crick soul crick soul i've
[1:11:34.780 --> 1:11:36.060]  met him before i forget his brother's name and he was asking me are you really in the
[1:11:36.060 --> 1:11:41.940]  illuminati have you really been approached by the cia and that was the video i was searching
[1:11:41.940 --> 1:11:49.020]  for when i found the other one and joe explains no he talks a lot of big executives and people
[1:11:49.020 --> 1:11:51.940]  and they don't know what's going on but they're scared too and that that's what i'm telling
[1:11:51.940 --> 1:12:00.860]  you is is that only at the Rothschild Rockefeller level and it's a very high advanced DARPA science
[1:12:00.860 --> 1:12:07.500]  levels do they have an idea of what's going on and they wrote about it in the 1860s right
[1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:18.260]  through and envisioned it all and they're a priest class a very secretive inbred individuals
[1:12:18.260 --> 1:12:27.860]  of germany france switzerland and the uk mainly and the chinese have agreed to the plan the
[1:12:27.860 --> 1:12:34.020]  japanese are scared to death and have agreed to it and only maybe 50 people at the top
[1:12:34.020 --> 1:12:39.300]  ever know the full plan but in intelligence you can always look at what's being set up
[1:12:39.300 --> 1:12:43.860]  and get most of it so we've reverse engineered a lot of it and 20 years later our reverse
[1:12:43.860 --> 1:12:48.340]  engineering turned out to be remarkably accurate because i read a lot of the white papers and
[1:12:48.340 --> 1:12:53.940]  things that their underlings were saying putting out plans of what they were doing but generally
[1:12:53.940 --> 1:12:57.980]  with another cover story but you could then look at a manhattan project in its cover stories
[1:12:57.980 --> 1:13:05.180]  and figure out what was really going on if you knew the pieces so that's why i get contacted
[1:13:05.180 --> 1:13:11.500]  by high level folks you know and the government cia corporations because they don't know but
[1:13:11.500 --> 1:13:14.660]  you don't think they let the whole government know what's going on you don't think they
[1:13:14.660 --> 1:13:18.140]  actually want intelligence agencies going on knowing what's going on do you know they
[1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:24.460]  want them to have missions and be highly scrutinized and controlled and so busy bureaucratically
[1:13:24.460 --> 1:13:27.860]  that they don't ever get the full picture of what's going on and then they're building
[1:13:27.860 --> 1:13:32.620]  giant spy grids and tentacles and the things and mandating all the hubs and back doors
[1:13:32.620 --> 1:13:37.700]  and trojan horses so that the real systems of google facebook and twitter and now apple
[1:13:37.700 --> 1:13:43.140]  merging with the chinese government can launch a huge a i war that's already going on deciding
[1:13:43.140 --> 1:13:46.900]  survival of the fittest because that's their religion survival of the fittest with this
[1:13:46.900 --> 1:13:52.220]  giant a i war that we're in and then when the a i war is over they're just going to
[1:13:52.220 --> 1:13:58.940]  decide how to wipe us out so the chinese government said in mouths day so go ahead and nuke us
[1:13:58.940 --> 1:14:04.300]  we got too many people so the globalists love the chinese chinese leader like we're ready
[1:14:04.300 --> 1:14:08.980]  to wipe out 99 percent of these people we're sick of them we hate them because anybody
[1:14:08.980 --> 1:14:16.980]  you feed on and you use the slaves you metaphysically hate never wonder why bank robber for no reason
[1:14:16.980 --> 1:14:20.780]  will just kind of break some guys nose or whatever because you feel bad about what you're doing
[1:14:20.780 --> 1:14:24.700]  so you go ahead and lash out at them for what you've done i'm gonna go to roger stone we
[1:14:24.700 --> 1:14:32.780]  come back with some big breaking news i just thought that we should tell any men out there

[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:51.480]  being a government operation which most americans now know to be true and the evidence has basically
[1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:56.800]  come out but i've told him i said listen i don't tell my talk show host what to say
[1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:02.920]  or what to do if i respect people think they're smart i put them on the air but i said sometimes
[1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:07.280]  if people keep harping on one thing i go you know i'm sick of hearing about this and i
[1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:12.200]  bet the audience is and i let the crew tells me i interrupt too much you know the crew
[1:21:12.200 --> 1:21:16.680]  i know i got my own problems i'm on a high horse here but i'm told roger stop defending
[1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:21.440]  yourself every time they lie but that's because i'm interviewing him all the time i'm following
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:29.160]  the news i know what he said in the middle of 2016 when he said of course i've been sending
[1:21:29.160 --> 1:21:34.680]  emails to wiki league to try to get a song john and of course he's on cnn he's on the
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:38.760]  new york times you know tv show you know he's on with sean hannity but he didn't give me
[1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:45.800]  any secret info and i wasn't passing info to him and that's totally untrue i've been
[1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:49.680]  trying to have intermediaries get a hold of him and find out what's really going on and
[1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:53.320]  one intermediary told me and he's now released that guy's name he's testified to congress

[1:21:58.480 --> 1:22:01.760]  trying to see how big is it what is it about what's in the wiki leagues well it's gonna
[1:22:01.760 --> 1:22:08.600]  hurt hillary and exactly what roger said came out now it's in the atlantic it is just uh
[1:22:08.600 --> 1:22:14.760]  everywhere uh the washington post you name it roger stones communicated directly with
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:20.560]  wiki leagues despite denials here's the atlantic document him please roger stones interacting
[1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:27.840]  with wiki leagues during the 2016 presidential campaign and then they say that they have
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:33.280]  reconstructed but they say at the very end of the article natasha bertrand's dms but
[1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:36.920]  they don't tell you till a blank page at the end no one would read that unless you find
[1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:41.240]  tooth come to it i had that in my page let's put up a screen for people i guess that one
[1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:46.320]  page fell off where they say these messages have been reproduced by the atlantic's art
[1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:57.000]  team so where'd they get these plus you read it it's wiki leagues going don't talk to us
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:01.440]  you've never talked to us before he's like yeah i just want you to clear this stuff up
[1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:08.160]  we never talk we told you we never talked to you we never will so you actually read what
[1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:14.640]  it says it's what roger stones testified to it's amazing so roger stones joins us and
[1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:20.920]  this isn't about russia we know that's a fraud the whole thing it's about the dis info ladies
[1:23:20.920 --> 1:23:25.480]  and gentlemen where i said i believe kids died i believe these kids aren't crisis actors
[1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:29.480]  but the four kids they picked on the democratic party payroll buzzfeed now admits that by the
[1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:35.480]  way of an article on that right here let's talk to him after tv viewers the day after
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:40.760]  it happened it said the women's march group has lent its organizers and funding and everything
[1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:47.560]  to it and and then they're on private jets and it says right here buzzfeed big progressive
[1:23:47.560 --> 1:23:55.320]  groups are helping organize the florida teens they've taken videos down where we say that
[1:23:55.320 --> 1:24:00.920]  but oh buzzfeed they're allowed to so you see this is the level of deception so i want to
[1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:05.800]  get roger to pop in because i remember we can go get the clips they use it as evidence
[1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:08.920]  what was on this show he's like of course i'm trying to get them on we were trying to get
[1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:12.120]  them on i don't know why a song goes on all the mainstream stuff and it doesn't come on
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:17.160]  ours i mean one time he was in an interview with jones dot to your when she was remember
[1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:20.440]  a parliament he like is in the camera trying to go hey come on the show and he like wouldn't
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:25.320]  do it uh so you know i've never had contact other than sending them probably 500 emails
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:30.440]  saying come on the show so again roger this is a next level fake news they're calling for
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:38.120]  your rest by the way recycle alex all of these questions um i i addressed uh under oath for
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:44.280]  the house intelligence committee all of this material uh was turned over to them at that
[1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:50.920]  time someone has doctored a direct bail exchange making it incomplete but even that
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:56.360]  is entirely exculpatory proves what i have said which is i had no advanced knowledge
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:03.240]  of the source or content of the wiki leaks disclosures on hillary i did have a confirming source
[1:25:03.800 --> 1:25:09.160]  an intermediary who who confirmed for me something a song it actually already said publicly and i
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:13.640]  forget his name what who's the new york talk show who's the new york talk show host uh randy
[1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:18.760]  credit code now he i've addressed this under oath before the committee he ultimately pled the fifth
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:24.840]  because the whole thing was outrageous all he did was confirm something assigned has said publicly
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:30.600]  assigned has said publicly repeatedly we never gave stone any information all stone was doing
[1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:35.800]  this following carefully what i said and what i tweeted and reporting it which is which is what
[1:25:35.800 --> 1:25:41.800]  i told the committee this but like any good reporter i remember going man can you get him on
[1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:45.800]  can you can you talk can you find out what it is you're like i'm working through my connections
[1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:51.320]  but he's very close lip we have these conversations on air and off air they're acting like i had no i
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:57.640]  had no communication with him in 2016 i commuted with wiki whoever mans the wiki leak desk i turned
[1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:02.600]  that all over it's innocuous it's let me just stop you right before the election i called
[1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:07.720]  assange names on air for not talking to me or you i'm not going to say the name i called him uh
[1:26:07.720 --> 1:26:10.760]  we'll we'll put it on screen but for radio listeners i'm not going to say it i called him a
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:15.160]  you know what plug i called him hillary's you know what plug because he wouldn't talk to us i mean
[1:26:16.440 --> 1:26:20.680]  it's it's it's incredible how they invert reality but again at the very same time they say
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:24.520]  you're not allowed to send emails to him asking him to confirm things and they say no we won't
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:30.760]  talk to you there he's giving interviews the new york times remember it's it's really extraordinary
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:38.520]  at the same time somebody is out planting this story that in 2016 i flew to london to meet with
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:44.920]  assange i've never met julien assange never been in his presence never spoken to him uh i actually
[1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:51.240]  just sent uh the pages the apocles i've got it we'll put it on screen we'll put it on screen
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:57.160]  you never went to london that year proves that i didn't leave the country at all in 2016 so i mean
[1:26:57.160 --> 1:27:04.280]  it this is just another fake news narrative that somebody is out actively marketing to reporter
[1:27:04.280 --> 1:27:11.960]  cbs nbc associated press uh the observer all of them calling saying did you fly to london to
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:17.560]  meet with assange no when i was there a couple weeks ago to address the ops reunion i was
[1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:23.000]  staying in london i went by and dropped my card off at the embassy and i also wrote an extensive
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:29.320]  piece at info wars about why it's time to stop persecuting a journalist this guy is being held
[1:27:29.320 --> 1:27:36.120]  in virtual captive in a tiny little cramped space he's not a russian asset he is he is a honest
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:41.640]  journalist no one has questioned the roger the accuracy of everything he's posted i was
[1:27:41.640 --> 1:27:47.880]  punking the british media but roger everyone is allowed to call wikileaks and try to get him on
[1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:54.520]  he's been on cnn 20 times this idea that we're not allowed to talk to wikileaks and then they
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:28:00.280]  won't talk to us because the media says it's they say he's a russian with no proof and then we're
[1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:03.880]  not allowed to talk to him because they're a russian but then they can all talk to him i'm sick
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:10.600]  of them defining everything nothing so in the public mind they defined this false narrative
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:16.280]  that he's a somehow a russian asset that wikileaks is a russian front when in fact it's just a news
[1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:22.440]  organization and that there's something improper if i had communicated directly with them which i did
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:28.920]  not uh other than what i disclosed to the committee which is innocuous that we went through this with
[1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:33.960]  with goose for two point no i know i really saw those direct but but shifting years is briefly

[1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:23.160]  to support people that aren't going to buckle it's these big box stores these big globalist groups

[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:48.440]  don't blame them you know media is a tough business and it's hard to get sponsorship especially
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:52.280]  your conservative or libertarian or you know what healthy food or a classical liberal it
[1:34:52.280 --> 1:34:59.080]  doesn't matter but we've got a bunch of specials running right now that are in some cases the
[1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:03.960]  biggest we've ever had because i want people to experience how good these products are because
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:09.000]  we're being censored because we're being attacked i ran a bunch of products 50 off like the fluoride
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:14.840]  free toothpaste and like the body's ultimate turmeric formula and others those sold out so
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:19.400]  we've got 20 off on super high quality body armor including backpack inserts that are so
[1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:23.240]  important for yourself and your children this is something just out around town you name it that's
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:31.640]  good to have also we've got 30 to 80 off site-wide massive limited time savings as part of this
[1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:35.640]  operation paul revere that we're going to kick off tomorrow at 8 a.m with david night and runs
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:40.520]  with the next day at 6 p.m with the war room with oma shroyer we're going to be live for 34 hours

[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:50.520]  freedom and of course on top of all of that we're going to do this so we can defend the second
[1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:55.720]  amendment the nra has seen record contributions come in and that's good because they saw record
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:36:00.520]  sponsors cut but it turns out the amount of money that came in just matched what they lost well hey
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:05.640]  we're here too and i say support the nra absolutely we need your financial supports i mean water
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:12.760]  filtration air filtration you name it it's all 30 to 80 off uh almost all items there's a few things
[1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:18.840]  where we're making like 30 profit on the food you you can't 30 off or or it's at cost and
[1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:22.440]  that they won't even let you do that so there's a few things in there that are regular price
[1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:28.360]  because they're already so low uh but we already only mark stuff up at regular sell price uh at
[1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:33.320]  uh about a hundred percent markup but we're never at 100 percent we're usually at about 50
[1:36:33.320 --> 1:36:37.880]  percent off markup so we're talking 50 percent everybody else is three four times markup and
[1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:43.400]  i get it with taxes regulations the bureaucracy you're running any company you get lawsuits you
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:47.080]  know just all sorts of you know crazy fake stuff especially if you're info wars so what i'm saying
[1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:53.240]  is we need your support we make it easy 30 percent off almost all items uh site-wide to help uh save
[1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:58.360]  us 30 to 80 percent off almost all items site-wide to help save while supporting the truth you're
[1:36:58.360 --> 1:37:04.280]  constantly under threat and are being censored and need your support to fight back the unprecedented
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:09.320]  sales covers almost all products including supplements outdoor gear apparel movies documentary
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:14.280]  films and more the only exceptions again are body armor harvest ride free drivers and the
[1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:19.160]  teaser of the month which will stay at the everyday low prices go to infowarstore.com today to get 30
[1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:25.800]  to 80 percent off almost all the products in the store and we've got just very important uh as an
[1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:30.520]  independent voice here you know over the last several years your organization in mind have both
[1:37:30.520 --> 1:37:35.960]  become you know very very mainstream uh producers of many health enhancing products and i got to
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:41.240]  say the value of what you're offering people is is quite extraordinary because if they go into a
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:45.400]  retail channel there's so much markup in the retail channel that the ingredients have to be
[1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:49.640]  really really cheap and if it's you know out of Whole Foods or out of grocery store or something
[1:37:49.640 --> 1:37:53.720]  like that the value of the ingredients that you're putting in because you're selling directly to
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:58.680]  people is really extraordinary i know i've got some of your products in our lab that we're looking
[1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:03.240]  at and the potency that we're seeing right now is just super high so i mean i know you didn't have
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:07.160]  me here to endorse your product line but i know i appreciate you doing because i i mean i i mean
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:10.680]  look i know we're a target plus i want to sell good stuff we just go out to the industry leaders
[1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:16.120]  and say what's the strongest turmeric out there well 450 milligrams with a 90 something curcumin
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:20.200]  and let me hear your expert on all this yeah that's as high as the industry gets we go with that a
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:24.040]  lot of folks as you said they're going to want to mark stuff up six seven times they want to be low
[1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:29.320]  price right so it's 30 bucks but there's a dollar a product not you know ten dollars a product you
[1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:34.120]  see that all the time all the time and it's the curcuminoids and if you you know there's so much
[1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:39.560]  amazing scientific research and medical research out there on so many of the benefits of curcumin
[1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:44.200]  and i think we we published stories today on that it you know for sports for fitness for recovery
[1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:47.960]  for there's a lot we're not supposed to say but it's known exactly there's things we can't say
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:52.360]  both of us can't there's a country so free yeah you know there's thousands of studies of what it does
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:58.120]  and and and it's the ultimate antioxidant and so look it's sold out in a month i did 50 off
[1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:02.120]  and we still made like you know six seven dollars a bottle now it's going to be regular price
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:06.680]  and it's still a good deal but i want folks to see how good it is so so you know that's
[1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:12.200]  uh uh sold out the point is is that we've got uh clearance apparel 80 percent off
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:17.400]  three way 50 percent off ages body armor 20 percent off info war's life of mine and body
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:23.400]  that is 40 percent off and i'm gonna stop right there all i'm saying is please support the broadcast
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:27.640]  and take advantage of this and let the globalists know no matter how hardcore their attacks are
[1:39:27.640 --> 1:39:31.400]  you're going to continue to support us because they just they just had a big site yesterday
[1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:35.560]  claim they weren't sponsoring us anymore and they never sponsored us but they were trying to get
[1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:40.120]  other sponsors to pull it was a total hoax of course that's what they do all the time it's all
[1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:45.240]  a disinfo war that's their goal the whole time but i got to say alex i think one of the main
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:50.200]  reasons that you are under attack and that youtube is engaged in this massive censorship purge
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:55.640]  is because something bigger is coming they have to shut off the voices that could argue with the
[1:39:55.640 --> 1:39:58.760]  official narrative i'm gonna stop you right there you're you're i'm gonna give me the form and come
[1:39:58.760 --> 1:40:02.360]  back all right that's the big enchilada i had three people in the office coming yesterday
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:07.720]  and they go alex you're not getting it john harman uh but and several others that one of
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:13.400]  their names mentioned that worker in the office they came to me and they said alex and they're
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:17.720]  always like like hesitant to tell me stuff like i want to hear stuff but see it's in the ether
[1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:21.080]  the knowledge you're one of the smartest guys i know so we come back we're gonna talk about this
[1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:27.000]  they've all come to me and they've all said boss obviously they're trying to censor everybody's
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:32.200]  trying to set a precedent this is about censorship but it's about a giant false flag that's coming
[1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:35.880]  and they don't want us there when it's happening they're scared because they keep having trouble
[1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:39.720]  pulling them off and clearly that's all they've got left and you're calling it the mother of
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:43.800]  false flags so when we come back we're going to cover why they don't want us on the air why

[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:57.560]  it didn't ever set it on air and i had a couple people come to me yesterday three people and
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:03.080]  bring this up which shows it's in the ether it's really important they don't want independent media
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:07.320]  questioning events they don't want us talking to eyewitnesses when there's events we said the
[1:48:07.320 --> 1:48:11.960]  sheriff's department stood down they did they took a video down where we said that they misconstrued
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:17.400]  what the video was but we had info wars to put up the raw videos drudge link to it seven million
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:23.560]  views blew up in their face they put more strikes on yesterday also saying we said nobody died the
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:29.400]  video we actually said people died they took the strike off no one's reporting that though
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:37.640]  shows singing in msnbc comedy central are saying ban info wars three strikes you're out is so
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:43.640]  americans the quote on one of the shows on comedy central so they're making it american to ban people
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:50.440]  and lie about what they said it's getting crazy and now this grease man accused of making terrorist
[1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:56.200]  threat in youtube video because there's a school behind him he's saying shoot shoot so again uh
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:00.760]  this hysteria is accelerating the exporting goods major gun retailer stops selling assault rifles
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:07.240]  and weapons uh mike adams obviously something big is here the globalists are trying to take
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:12.520]  control of this country they are trying to bully us into submission it's happening worldwide they
[1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:18.360]  admit they are what do you see in the tea leaves with not just info wars but thousands of prominent
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:24.120]  libertarian conservative nationalistic natural health sites anything grassroots anything pro people
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:29.720]  anything popular uh is being deleted being blocked being slandered it's extraordinary first let's
[1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:36.120]  examine the level of content selective censorship which means that youtube and other content platforms
[1:49:36.120 --> 1:49:41.800]  tech giants they are picking a side and then declaring that the other side of the debate
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:46.520]  has no right to speak and ultimately what the left believes is that individuals such as yourself
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:52.360]  and perhaps myself as well have no right to exist they believe that president trump has no right to
[1:49:52.360 --> 1:49:57.560]  be president they believe that any conservative or libertarian voice has no right to exercise a
[1:49:57.560 --> 1:50:02.280]  first amendment right in fact they're calling for me to be banned from youtube period absolutely and
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:07.720]  once that's done it's banned everywhere digitally in this age that is the mark of the beast make no
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:13.000]  mistake they would prefer to see you absolutely obliterated and destroyed in the same way that
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:18.040]  they call for murdering president trump they call for murdering milo yinopoulos or an colter or
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:23.080]  other conservative speakers you know uc berkeley the students they're penned articles in the student
[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:27.320]  paper where they said that they have the right to murder conservative speakers in order to stop
[1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:34.120]  their speech because they consider words to be states as in the front page whites are are subhuman
[1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:39.400]  are genetics are are bad well yeah that's just another example of this but where is this going
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:45.960]  first of all they have to silence anyone who can dissent anyone who can question the official
[1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:51.160]  story because they have to be able to control the official story when the next big thing happens
[1:50:51.160 --> 1:50:56.440]  which i'm calling the mother of all false flags they have to make sure that no one can question
[1:50:56.440 --> 1:51:01.960]  the narrative right now she in china the leader there he is trying to say that he should be emperor
[1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:08.840]  forever that there should be no more elections the term i believe the term in chinese is i do not agree
[1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:14.520]  or i disagree that term has now been banned across all social media of china that is it you've got
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:20.600]  all this is in a near china your wife's chinese is taiwanese in taiwanese yes so you know these
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:25.080]  things and again our media goes oh he's about to be a dictator it's already the chinese party that
[1:51:25.080 --> 1:51:31.240]  elects him he's already a dictator of an oligarchy but but now he wants for life to be put in and
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:35.800]  and there was only two articles right by the other side of the communist party that mildly said this
[1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:41.720]  might cause some turmoil and our media criticized them for doing it our media apple now moving
[1:51:41.720 --> 1:51:46.840]  to china with the code keys how big is that well yeah it's huge but remember that the history of
[1:51:46.840 --> 1:51:52.360]  the cultural revolution in china is that young children in that time were told to murder their
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:57.560]  parents or to call the government on their parents they literally took people out of their homes and
[1:51:57.560 --> 1:52:04.120]  beat them to death this was the youth antifa antifa antifa all of it black lives matter models
[1:52:04.120 --> 1:52:09.720]  themselves exactly mal's red brigade you got it that's exactly it and antifa in austin texas right
[1:52:09.720 --> 1:52:14.920]  here in austin texas antifa according to recent reports is now recruiting mentally ill individuals
[1:52:14.920 --> 1:52:19.800]  to be used as human weapons against their intended so now just like google could ban the word gun
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:24.760]  they're banning i disagree right in china now this is a reflection of exactly what's happening in
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:31.640]  youtube facebook google and twitter and it's being directed against you now my my conclusion alex is
[1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:37.000]  that this is not a standalone issue this is a prelude to something much bigger that's coming
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:41.960]  where they must control the narrative in order to get away with it what i'm calling the mother of
[1:52:41.960 --> 1:52:48.040]  all false flags now we could all take educated guesses about what those false flags might be
[1:52:48.040 --> 1:52:52.280]  but what we do know for sure is that it's going to follow the pattern of false flags that have
[1:52:52.280 --> 1:52:57.880]  always taken place and i want to clarify so that there's no fake news about this a false flag is a
[1:52:57.880 --> 1:53:02.920]  real event it's real carnage with a fake narrative all right so i want to be clear about that i don't
[1:53:02.920 --> 1:53:07.000]  want anybody to accuse us of saying that sure they define false flag as being trimming show
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:11.640]  everything's fake no you can let somebody attack yeah you can open the door you can stand down
[1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:17.960]  that's right the attacks were real children died in florida at parkland high school but the narrative
[1:53:17.960 --> 1:53:23.560]  is unraveling by the hour the narrative is fake now that is small scale compared to what they likely
[1:53:23.560 --> 1:53:28.680]  have planned something that could cost the lives of potentially tens of thousands of americans
[1:53:28.680 --> 1:53:33.640]  but they will make sure that they blame you they will make sure that the scapegoat there's always
[1:53:33.640 --> 1:53:38.040]  a scapegoat that that person will be a trump supporter that person will be an nra member let's
[1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:43.320]  say oh clearly they're setting info wars up yes to be like our supporter does it or something
[1:53:43.320 --> 1:53:48.280]  absolutely absolutely they'll make sure that there are cookies in that guy's web browser
[1:53:48.280 --> 1:53:53.080]  for info wars.com they've done that before as you know that's not the first time that's happened
[1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:57.080]  they will set it up and they'll have a scapegoat well they'll announce the day of an event that
[1:53:57.080 --> 1:54:01.160]  turns out to be staged that he visited info wars well the psychic's millions of visitors a day
[1:54:01.160 --> 1:54:06.360]  most people been to it right and in reality it's the left that is deranged that is seething with
[1:54:06.360 --> 1:54:13.160]  anger that is calling for violence we're talking about a lunatic liberal mob that is engaged
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:17.560]  in mob violence and mob screaming and mob anger look at that that cnn town hall event how they were
[1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:23.000]  screaming burn her dana lash yeah burn her they were screaming at marco rubio this i mean were
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:28.840]  they watching money python holy grail which which i know but it but it is no joke that it's a Salem
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:33.720]  which trials kind of environment they're saying burn good-looking women like what art type is that
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:38.200]  well and how do you look at a good-looking woman say i want to burn her but i i don't want to do
[1:54:38.200 --> 1:54:43.320]  that today on losh dana dana lash deserves tremendous respect for standing up to the
[1:54:43.320 --> 1:54:48.600]  lotion lash it's lash it's actually pronounced lash but it's spelled losh yeah so i i get it but
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:54.120]  anyway she has incredible courage and what i'm seeing now across the independent media
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:55:00.680]  is a galvanizing of independent people publishers content creators radio hosts who are now all
[1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:06.600]  saying guess what if we don't work together we are all going to perish and be destroyed by this
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:11.880]  radical left-wing regime well imagine they call her a murderer first they demonize you then burn
[1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:15.960]  her burn her she had to leave her women were rushing the stage trying to attack yes because
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:20.520]  they're all nonviolent nice people they just want our guns and then malice youth brigade
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:24.440]  turn well they're they're deranged i mean it's almost like there's been a some kind of lobotomy
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:28.520]  like someone's drilled into their brains it's like spiritual like it's like suddenly like like one
[1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:33.080]  fire ant bites you another 20 they crawl up your leg they all start stinging it's like pheromone it's
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:38.360]  like there but i think they have to have a daily dose of hatred from late night so-called comedians
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:43.080]  you know who are pushing hatred all the time you know these daytime tv talk shows uh are pushing
[1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:49.080]  hatred all the time the the fake news media is pushing hatred you know in in truth most people
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:54.760]  support the second amendment because they want to be able to defend themselves against the just
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:59.400]  exactly the kind of lunatics that are these raging mobs that pose a danger to civilization
[1:55:59.400 --> 1:56:02.680]  you know you think about it why do we need a second amendment you know it's not just what the
[1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:07.800]  founding fathers said which was to defend yourself against a future potential government that becomes
[1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:13.320]  tyrannical out of control it's also you need to be able to defend yourself against a lunatic mob
[1:56:13.320 --> 1:56:16.840]  that is well that's what the second amendment generally is for i mean i mean i mean it can
[1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:22.040]  be for corrupt government that's rare criminals and mobs that's right mobs is the biggest and
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:27.320]  lynchings we we live in a republic right not a democracy which means the mob cannot take away
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:31.640]  your individual liberties because they're guaranteed by the bill of rights that's right you're on fire
[1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:37.640]  mike adams the health ranger natural news dot com what type of false flag do you see happening
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:43.240]  in your gut in your mind's eye uh the most likely event that uh and again i don't hope this happens
[1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:47.480]  in any way whatsoever this would be disastrous but the easiest thing for a left wing terrorist to do
[1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:53.000]  is to get a hold of medical radiological isotopes combine it with a kinetic bomb a chemical bomb and
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:57.960]  create basically a dirty bomb that they unleash in a city possibly if they want to murder president
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:57:02.600]  trump which they openly talk about they would try to do that when he is visiting a city that kind of
[1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:08.360]  terrorist attack has a very large area effect and a long-term radiological poisoning effect
[1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:13.080]  once you inhale those radiological particles not going back right strontium 91 is a common
[1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:18.760]  isotope used in medical imaging equipment it is out there you you know someone who wanted to be a
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:23.560]  terrorist could find it and they could commit terror and by the way the fbi has a history of
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:30.360]  recruiting homeless people to commit you know fake crimes so they can stop the terrorism and claim
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:35.240]  that they caught a terrorist that's been done repeatedly but the leftist leftist groups in
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:39.800]  the fbi they can let that slip through we'll be right back with mike adams he's on fire i'm alex
[1:57:39.800 --> 1:57:43.640]  jones we're up the phones a little bit later as well stay with us hour number three
[1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:54.520]  let's talk to victor in florida victor uh you're calling go ahead yes uh hi alex first i just want
[1:57:54.520 --> 1:58:01.000]  to mention if people just go and try the products they will be ordering all the time i've ordered
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:06.760]  several of the products over and over because it's amazing in particular silver bullet i as soon
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:11.720]  as i start to feel like i get a little stick you know maybe like a little raspiness in my throat
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:16.920]  i drop some silver bullet and it like i'll still feel a little sick but it won't last as long and i
[1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:22.200]  just ordered the body the alpha power and the pollen block well let me just say something victor
[1:58:22.200 --> 1:58:25.800]  it's people like you that then fund the whole operation because a very small percentage of
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:30.360]  people buy products and a very small percentage of them by a lot of the products so thank you but
[1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:35.480]  when you mention the uh the silver bullet colloidal silver it's got thousands of reviews a 98
[1:58:35.480 --> 1:58:40.200]  percent review it is our highest reviewed product because it is from the top lab in the country
[1:58:40.200 --> 1:58:43.880]  discounted high quality colloidal silver and it's not a silver bullet but the closest thing you're
[1:58:43.880 --> 1:58:51.800]  going to find to a silver bullet introducing fluorolife the new probiotic line developed
[1:58:51.800 --> 1:58:57.480]  exclusively by info wars life after years of research on the human microbiome not all probiotics
[1:58:57.480 --> 1:59:02.760]  are made the same fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the
[1:59:02.760 --> 1:59:08.840]  stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect this is critical because stomach
[1:59:08.840 --> 1:59:14.120]  acid kills most probiotics so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic then you're cheating
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:19.640]  your gut health and your wallet fluorolife supports your body's core where you need it most including
[1:59:19.640 --> 1:59:24.840]  digestion regularity immunity the gut lining and metabolism did you know that over 80 percent of
[1:59:24.840 --> 1:59:30.600]  your immune system is located in your gut that's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:35.800]  for overall health fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care
[1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:41.080]  and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program head to info wars life
[1:59:41.080 --> 1:59:45.640]  dot com to pick up your bottle of fluorolife probiotics today that's info wars life dot com
[1:59:51.480 --> 1:59:54.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:59:54.120 --> 2:00:07.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:07.640 --> 2:00:24.120]  do it's alex jones on a gcm radio network
[2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:29.160]  mike adams riding shotgun with me who wants to get a dick sporting goods the censorship will do
[2:00:29.160 --> 2:00:34.200]  that next segment you were saying some really important stuff during the break when do they push
[2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:39.880]  too far how long do we put up with this the censorship the bullying the insanity well i believe
[2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:45.480]  they're already pushing too far public trust in these institutions that were once bulletproof so
[2:00:45.480 --> 2:00:51.720]  to speak that had blind faith and blind trust that public trust has been it's gone i mean who
[2:00:51.720 --> 2:00:57.720]  trusts the fbi anymore who trusts the central banks or the federal reserve who trusts google
[2:00:57.720 --> 2:01:02.920]  anymore you know google started out as do no evil now pretty much they're synonymous with evil at this
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:09.320]  point who trusts youtube to bring you the most relevant videos people know they're being censored
[2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:13.160]  that youtube is deciding what you can see and what you can't see and they're doing so based
[2:01:13.160 --> 2:01:19.560]  on their own political biases so the public trust i mean even in education even in local
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:25.080]  government public trust in the broward county sheriff's department whose deputies stood down
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:29.720]  while the shooting was taking place the public trust is gone and what that means is that
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:34.760]  there there will be an opportunity to rebuild public trust in something that's rooted in more
[2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:39.880]  reality more truth independent media for example what you're doing here at info wars when i'm
[2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:44.920]  doing a natural news and many other people out there we are actually i believe the future of
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:51.240]  real news for america i mean cnn is finished who believes cnn anymore fake news green screens
[2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:59.160]  anderson cooper mr you know cia guy uh the town hall everything's fake i mean not fake but but
[2:01:59.160 --> 2:02:02.200]  arrange you know the questions were arranged you have to ask this question of that we got
[2:02:02.200 --> 2:02:07.000]  real students but they give them fake questions real students scripted scripted exactly who
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:13.720]  trusts cnn anymore no rational reasonable person trusts cnn all i know is cnn says we're filing
[2:02:13.720 --> 2:02:20.280]  complaints to shut info wars down they get videos taken down we didn't even say what they said by a
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:26.600]  long shot and then the news goes jones claims cnn's complaining and jones claims is a campaign
[2:02:26.600 --> 2:02:31.240]  to take him down but yeah let's take him down it's like mentally ill double think it's like
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:36.360]  you're at the mad hatter's tea party yeah but they're doing it on purpose they go okay they know
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:41.880]  we're lying let's just scramble everything until they go into fetal positions well yeah make no
[2:02:41.880 --> 2:02:46.200]  mistake every mainstream media outlet or what used to be mainstream every day they get a memo
[2:02:46.200 --> 2:02:50.840]  that memo tells them exactly what words and phrases to use what fake allegations to make
[2:02:50.840 --> 2:02:57.400]  toward president trump or alks jones they they're told exactly they've had CNN shows where one ends
[2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:02.200]  with stelter jones is horrible has to be banned he claims his sheriff's department stood down
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:06.520]  they come back and jake tapper comes on with a whole show about the stand down yes it's not even
[2:03:06.520 --> 2:03:12.120]  congruent well i i decided to see it in article by jake tapper that reported that they stood down
[2:03:12.680 --> 2:03:17.080]  tapper wrote that i mean that's that's what i mean though they're like we can tell you they stood
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:22.600]  down but you but but you said it first you can't right exactly because you were correct before they
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:26.840]  were correct because you have better analysis because you have more history of understanding
[2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:31.800]  how these things work you're the bad guy even though they confirmed exactly what you said it's
[2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:36.920]  it's it's unreal the level of deception that's out there today and they can't keep track of it
[2:03:36.920 --> 2:03:42.120]  because i mean telling the truth is easy because you do the research but with them imagine lying
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:47.240]  all the time who can keep track of it well no i i i mean it's hard enough to keep track of just telling
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:51.400]  the truth and all the stories that we both publish at our organizations that's that's a full-time job
[2:03:51.400 --> 2:03:55.880]  but i don't know how they keep track of all their deceptions but again they get a memo every day
[2:03:55.880 --> 2:04:01.720]  the thing is you know journalism is truly mainstream journalism is dead in america it doesn't
[2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:05.960]  exist anymore because those so-called journalists they don't ask questions they're incapable of
[2:04:05.960 --> 2:04:10.120]  thinking for themselves they're incapable of challenging the status quo and it's only in
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:14.280]  the independent media that you have individuals who are willing to stand up and say wait a second
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:19.720]  this doesn't make sense why did these sheriffs not enter the building when they're trained to enter
[2:04:19.720 --> 2:04:24.280]  the building they're all trained in active shooter scenarios why were the emt's and they come out and
[2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:29.720]  say well first they told us wait body cams well they told us not to go in and the question is why
[2:04:29.720 --> 2:04:34.600]  did israel do that just the ability to ask a reasonable question is under assault in this
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:40.200]  country today the bigger exactly but why why would they have to wait for sheriff israel to tell them
[2:04:40.200 --> 2:04:46.120]  to go in right right i would have gone in right that second you just lay down and the media goes
[2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:50.280]  oh no you wouldn't you're a coward okay well the trained cops are supposed to and most cops will
[2:04:50.280 --> 2:04:54.840]  do that i mean a cop think there's a robbery they always go in well why why not at school shootings
[2:04:56.600 --> 2:05:03.080]  introducing cell force by info wars life cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and
[2:05:03.080 --> 2:05:10.200]  protection mitochondria produce over 95 of your energy they are your body's cellular engines cell
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:15.800]  force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria much like a cellular
[2:05:15.800 --> 2:05:21.800]  engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run at 100 efficiency then they start producing
[2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:28.680]  reactive oxygen species top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage
[2:05:28.680 --> 2:05:34.920]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species the antioxidants found in cell force are some of the
[2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:40.760]  most powerful available on the market the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge
[2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:48.040]  for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals boost protect and adapt with cell force
[2:05:48.040 --> 2:06:01.640]  from info wars life head to info wars life dot com or call 1-888-253-3139 we've got it
[2:06:01.640 --> 2:06:17.240]  you waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:40.840]  i didn't get to this yesterday but i want to get to it because mike's here and he was
[2:06:40.840 --> 2:06:46.760]  bringing it up coming up these video clips were cnn msnbc said women can't shoot guns women can't
[2:06:46.760 --> 2:06:51.720]  carry guns they're wearing dresses they don't know how to use them we can't arm teachers i mean it's
[2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:56.520]  women carrying like six concealed guns oh it was just crazy end of the olympics women shoot as
[2:06:56.520 --> 2:07:00.200]  good or better than men oh yeah you take women out it's true women learn how to shoot quicker
[2:07:00.200 --> 2:07:04.120]  because they don't have preconceived notions they're very good with firearms when they're trained
[2:07:04.120 --> 2:07:09.000]  well i've taken out with like mike judge and others whole strings of hollywood starlets uh
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:14.920]  because we like to deprogram them uh and we just set them down with like a you know a r15 and that's
[2:07:14.920 --> 2:07:18.360]  what i don't let's probably want to ban that because it's such an easy gun to use and they're
[2:07:18.360 --> 2:07:22.520]  shooting bullseye like 200 yards in like 10 minutes and they're like my god this is incredible i'm
[2:07:22.520 --> 2:07:27.240]  pro second amendment it's over yeah and there's almost no recoil too i mean it's easy to handle
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:30.360]  so that's coming up in a minute but you want to get into exporting goods too but you want to get
[2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:34.600]  back into the whole censorship and the massive push happening there because it's all over the news
[2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:40.440]  saying ban info wars um just a final thought the clever guy last night said here's videos we think
[2:07:40.440 --> 2:07:45.640]  violate the rules ban him and so there's nothing more america than three strikes ban jones well
[2:07:45.640 --> 2:07:50.440]  effectively though youtube's rules come down to you have to agree with youtube that's really what
[2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:55.400]  the terms of service user agreement is at this point now but the question is if they're going
[2:07:55.400 --> 2:08:00.120]  to pick a side of every public debate they're picking a side and they're saying that the side
[2:08:00.120 --> 2:08:05.960]  that they don't like gets censored or blacklisted and banned then you got to ask the question number
[2:08:05.960 --> 2:08:10.520]  one how dangerous is that for a so-called free society if you cannot engage in a debate you
[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:16.120]  cannot have a dissenting view but the bigger question is how does youtube decide that what's
[2:08:16.120 --> 2:08:22.600]  correct what is their ultimate divine source of truth and wisdom that they use as a gauge
[2:08:22.600 --> 2:08:28.760]  to ban all opposing views because the answer is they're looking at the mainstream media which we
[2:08:28.760 --> 2:08:36.680]  know is fake news so if cnn is their holy grail of truth and wisdom their their entire basis is fake
[2:08:36.680 --> 2:08:42.600]  and they're banning actually the voices that are based in truth and based in evidence and logic and
[2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:48.120]  reason that's the danger that it's not see how it's not just about info wars you know being
[2:08:48.120 --> 2:08:53.240]  silenced or you being silenced it's about and you you spoke about this a lot it's about the banning
[2:08:53.240 --> 2:08:58.280]  of logic and reason and the ability to say one plus one equals two it's about it's about banning
[2:08:58.280 --> 2:09:03.000]  everybody that's crazy about three weeks ago they had wall street journal articles when we met with
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:07.480]  google facebook and twitter and we're going to call it bullying and ban basically all this pollution
[2:09:07.480 --> 2:09:12.760]  online starting with aleph shone's and then you see uh all the different cnn hosts you name it
[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:18.600]  using the same term pollution garbage and time to take that's like dan rather saying it they've
[2:09:18.600 --> 2:09:26.680]  got stelter and back on the same show with hog saying ban me and then hog's calling me all these
[2:09:26.680 --> 2:09:31.960]  names and saying i'll debate you all destroy i go come on he goes no i won't and the headline is
[2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:39.240]  jones begs hog to come on well let's be clear uh hog you know he's later the left will consider him
[2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:44.920]  to be in their own words a useful idiot okay i'm not calling him cognitively that that's a linen
[2:09:44.920 --> 2:09:49.240]  term that's a term that he's a high school senior public figure that's right calling me a piece of
[2:09:49.240 --> 2:09:54.200]  s h you know what t and other things so we're allowed to say we believe he's a pr personal let
[2:09:54.200 --> 2:09:59.640]  hell buzz feed it mentioned he's funded by him well you know right here the truth is uh being able to
[2:09:59.640 --> 2:10:07.160]  survive a gunfire does not make you an instant expert on second amendment issues or complex
[2:10:07.160 --> 2:10:13.800]  legislative issues you know we love young people we love kids to be safe and to have their right
[2:10:13.800 --> 2:10:18.360]  but they're not our leaders they don't have the life experience yet to be able to talk about these
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:26.600]  complex issues a flattering photo of me though but you know look uh you know i these kids i'm
[2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:31.560]  i'm glad that they're speaking out but they do not have the right to violate our like a chip
[2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:38.280]  monk on pcp sorry look there's another one look at the images that is sorry that's a good one huh oh
[2:10:38.280 --> 2:10:45.240]  my okay well for radio listeners we'll just have to imagine that oh my gosh yeah entertaining but
[2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:49.560]  i'm just having fun with this no notice how he puts an american flag behind him to make fun of us
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:54.040]  right when they wanted to destroy the country they're global they went open borders you name it
[2:10:54.040 --> 2:11:00.600]  right well look uh what's weird is how they copy everything we do of course it's because it's
[2:11:00.600 --> 2:11:04.040]  effective but can i talk about dick sporting goods for a second yeah i want you to whatever you want
[2:11:04.040 --> 2:11:08.120]  to uh you know i maybe you've already covered this but i think i think all info wars listeners
[2:11:08.120 --> 2:11:13.560]  should should just stop buying anything from dicks at this point i think i think dicks is
[2:11:13.560 --> 2:11:21.800]  a serious you know you know what well you know look they it's not illegal to sell firearms but they
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:26.520]  want to ban them anyway through their own retail stores and by the way i haven't met a single leftist
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:31.480]  who can accurately define so-called assault rifle in the first place none of them know what that means
[2:11:31.480 --> 2:11:35.640]  none of them seem to know the difference between you know semi-automatic or i think cnn said fully
[2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:41.640]  semi-automatic which is just the laughing stock of the internet right now fully semi-automatic
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:45.800]  they don't understand the difference between calibers they don't understand difference between you
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:51.400]  know a 300 blackout cartridge versus a 556 they don't understand a pistol configured ar like an
[2:11:51.400 --> 2:11:57.800]  ar pistol versus an ar rifle or uh let's say an arm brace they they have no idea what i'm even talking
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:03.160]  about they have no idea and by the way there are pistol calibers that are far more powerful than the
[2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:08.200]  556 caliber for an ar they're choosing that even though it's in less than two percent of the crimes
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:12.600]  to set the precedent to ban all semi-auto the bill introduced by feinstein today
[2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:19.000]  bans all semi-auto yeah so so they just go oh it's just one gun and why in every mass murder
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:24.120]  at the schools are they on drugs and they pick this gun so if that isn't scripting it just shows
[2:12:24.120 --> 2:12:29.560]  the media tells them what to use it's like this is the gun yeah this is how you do it yeah well
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:32.680]  and actually what they have in common a lot of these school shooters they've been bullied by their
[2:12:32.680 --> 2:12:37.480]  classmates they're on psychiatric medications they're they're infatuated with dead animals
[2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:42.600]  usually and talk about death and sometimes satanic stuff satanic imagery almost always like you get in
[2:12:42.600 --> 2:12:47.960]  the hollywood you know movies or super bowl halftime it's all usually it's satanic imagery during the
[2:12:47.960 --> 2:12:53.000]  super bowl uh you know music pieces they're always going to shoot them up video games
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:57.080]  always it seems seems to be the case but it's it's all these factors that come into play
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:13:01.960]  and then yeah they they like knives and guns as well but you can't just say oh it's the nra
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:07.240]  oh burn dana lash you know that's that's absurd you have to look at the multiple factors you
[2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:12.120]  don't want to burn it'll be nice to her yeah of course i mean she's the one who's standing up for
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:16.440]  your right to protect her family if you think about it we don't want to burn her she's pretty well
[2:13:16.440 --> 2:13:25.640]  well these i'll leave that comment to you i'm i'm just enamored with her courage all right and
[2:13:25.640 --> 2:13:30.840]  her second amendment stance to me she's beautiful because of that and everything i know i know we're
[2:13:30.840 --> 2:13:35.800]  having fun the point is is that is that we you know we pull back from this and we look at this
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:40.440]  and we see what's unfolding here and we could play some of these clips coming up the next segment
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:46.760]  and open the phones up but obviously school shootings are still very rare they hype them up
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:52.840]  their tragedies they're projecting all this on us and saying you know hashtag kill in our
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:58.280]  ray members and billboards and it's a ridiculous pr stunt the media seized on this they're driving
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:03.080]  ahead they're never going to give up so the question is where does it all in well this is
[2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:07.880]  going to end very likely in civil war i believe ultimately i don't know if it's okay for me to
[2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:12.360]  say that right now but well no the i mean the left says robert reiner says we're in a civil war
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:18.600]  well i believe the info war stage of the civil war has begun and you are one of the targets of
[2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:23.400]  that they have to control the narrative well i resist 45 is antifa is the george coro scripted
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:28.920]  in full page ads three times they pay for a deal saying kill the nr a well of course and i i think
[2:14:28.920 --> 2:14:34.200]  that these radical left-wing many young people may mean kill the american people being able to
[2:14:34.200 --> 2:14:39.800]  resist themselves from us a little potbellied communist well look they they planned on inauguration
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:43.400]  translating robert reiner i want to enslave these people if we do the russians will teach them
[2:14:43.400 --> 2:14:47.720]  will stop the christians to death their women are ours we're almost there ready to break their
[2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:53.000]  will please help hollywood destroy them but that's happening as hollywood is collapsing yeah well
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:56.680]  again it's that public faith and all these institutions is collapsing but in its place
[2:14:56.680 --> 2:15:03.000]  is going to rise up really a new i think a society that's rooted in more morals and values see the
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:06.840]  left doesn't like any values they don't want you to have any because then you stand for something
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:11.080]  and they can't turn you into a victim they write and and while they're murdering 900 babies a day at
[2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:15.480]  the abortion mills and then they scream about children in school i would you hear planned
[2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:20.520]  parenthood is in this buzzfeed article is the second largest sponsor after the women's march which
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:25.720]  is george soros to learn the kids to protect themselves they want oh my god we couldn't kill
[2:15:25.720 --> 2:15:29.480]  you in the womb so now we want to run your life well i mean according to the abortion industry
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:33.640]  the only thing wrong with the parkland high school shooting is that those children weren't
[2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:38.520]  young enough if they had been just being born the the left to think murdering them is perfectly
[2:15:38.520 --> 2:15:43.080]  okay with it you know i tweeted an image yesterday that said image of planned parenthood versus
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:48.200]  image in the n r a one of them sells arms the other defends the second amendment and one of
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:52.920]  them harvests arms and skulls and organs to sell to medical but that's liberal just like china the

[2:20:04.120 --> 2:20:14.120]  you
[2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:26.120]  mike adams is my guess we're gonna take some calls coming up the next two segments specifically
[2:20:27.080 --> 2:20:33.640]  on which side do you stand where is this fight going how much crazy will the globalist get how
[2:20:33.640 --> 2:20:39.400]  i mean how nuts is their bottom line how far will they go toll free number to join us eight seven
[2:20:39.400 --> 2:20:43.720]  seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine for your
[2:20:43.720 --> 2:20:48.600]  quick comment or question for myself from mike adams eight seven seven seven eight nine two five
[2:20:48.600 --> 2:20:52.200]  three nine and that's what you were saying during the break before we get these clips
[2:20:52.200 --> 2:20:55.720]  is where they condescend women and say you know they don't have to have firearms there
[2:20:55.720 --> 2:21:00.120]  they're wearing skirts they you know they you they couldn't wear them but a female police officer
[2:21:00.120 --> 2:21:03.880]  she can have a gun it's just you know the way the left operates but you were saying
[2:21:04.440 --> 2:21:09.400]  which side are you on well it's very crucial to make a decision now obviously your listeners
[2:21:09.400 --> 2:21:13.800]  know what side they're on they're on the side of the this constitutional republic the side of liberty
[2:21:13.800 --> 2:21:18.840]  but even leftists out there they think they're on the side of social justice but they're calling
[2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:23.560]  for basically the selected elimination of the first amendment and then the elimination of the
[2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:27.160]  second amendment and basically the elimination of the fourth amendment because they believe
[2:21:27.160 --> 2:21:32.520]  government has the right to be weaponized and spy on you like authoritarians do every time absolutely
[2:21:32.520 --> 2:21:37.800]  but what they don't yet realize is that all of these weapons will be turned against themselves
[2:21:37.800 --> 2:21:42.120]  that's what happens in every communist style radical left-wing revolution it always does
[2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:46.120]  three yeah they are the people that take them to power are always called the useful idiots
[2:21:46.120 --> 2:21:51.080]  hitler called the essay that well absolutely and you know country is like cuba or especially
[2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:56.120]  like north korea they started out as a revolution in the name of social justice or communist china
[2:21:56.120 --> 2:22:01.000]  started out as a revolution in the name of equality and it has become a totalitarian regime
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:05.800]  and what these leftists need to realize is that you can never be radical enough to fit into the
[2:22:05.800 --> 2:22:12.920]  current lunacy of the liberal mob for example a few years ago if you were a gay couple you were
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:17.800]  part of the lgbt movement you were part of the left you were accepted you were let's say a gay
[2:22:17.800 --> 2:22:24.920]  white couple but today if you're a gay white couple well you're white so you don't you're not
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:29.480]  gay enough i've noticed in england and stuff they make whites at liberal events even if they're gay
[2:22:29.480 --> 2:22:33.000]  paid again but nobody else right right so it's all alike we're going to teach you how to be
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:36.840]  discriminated against you have to be non-white gay to be okay to be accepted now so you're
[2:22:36.840 --> 2:22:41.240]  discriminated against for being white even if you're a gay couple and it's just going to continue
[2:22:41.240 --> 2:22:45.160]  it's and it's almost it's this is a weird liberal equation that always changes like you have to be
[2:22:45.160 --> 2:22:49.080]  because they know it's over in window they make it incredibly insane and say we're banning the word
[2:22:49.080 --> 2:22:54.120]  mother and father and major universities come out from what is it oxford to purdue and say don't
[2:22:54.120 --> 2:22:59.880]  say man in your papers or will mark because that's a word of evil uh it's like that sounds crazy it's
[2:22:59.880 --> 2:23:04.680]  meant to make you put up with anything it's like salsa doom talking to a woman jump off the cliff
[2:23:04.680 --> 2:23:09.080]  they're like why it's an exercise of power but what goes along with this this desire to twist and
[2:23:09.080 --> 2:23:13.880]  control your logic and reason is also this desire to control your language to shape your words and
[2:23:13.880 --> 2:23:19.640]  limit your words so you can't say these particular words but you can't search by i got on google now
[2:23:19.640 --> 2:23:26.760]  you can't it on shopping you can't search like you said in china uh what's the new term uh i disagree
[2:23:26.760 --> 2:23:32.680]  or i do not agree yeah that's mainstream news i right i disagree is now banned right right and
[2:23:32.680 --> 2:23:38.040]  apple has moved over there and is going to help do that well of course and this this is a technocracy
[2:23:38.040 --> 2:23:43.640]  as as you mentioned in the last hour i believe it's a technocratic totalitarian takeover attempt
[2:23:43.640 --> 2:23:47.800]  of our society you know what's crucial here is think about the first amendment in the bill of
[2:23:47.800 --> 2:23:54.120]  rights was written to protect us from government's attempts to suppress free speech but the first
[2:23:54.120 --> 2:23:59.320]  amendment did not write in protections against corporations attacking your free speech rights
[2:23:59.320 --> 2:24:03.160]  and that's where the shift needs to happen we need to understand well people noticed and i
[2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:07.320]  liked hucker carlson he said these kids are scripted they're not actors in the sense that
[2:24:07.320 --> 2:24:11.720]  they're fake that they are on the acting club it is scripted that they've been brought in
[2:24:11.720 --> 2:24:16.520]  they're being protected that the sheriff stood down he was saying that three days after he doesn't
[2:24:16.520 --> 2:24:20.840]  get banned because they're not ready to go for something that's establishment like that yet
[2:24:20.840 --> 2:24:24.680]  right he's going to get rid of it all down here and then they can get that and damn it
[2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:28.920]  tucker carlson you calls me texts me wanted to come here wanted to have dinner he's a good guy
[2:24:28.920 --> 2:24:33.000]  i haven't even emailed him or called him yet uh he's a nice guy i haven't called but he is you
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  know foxes banned him coming on the show that's fine but he needs to come on and decry this
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:43.080]  because news core ceo three weeks ago was in the news saying we've done a deal to call everything
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:49.080]  bullying with google and censor the internet left and right so we can only have uh corporate stuff
[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:54.200]  on facebook twitter and google and you know what we need to not just protest congress and not just
[2:24:54.200 --> 2:24:59.240]  warn trump and not just protest google we need to say to tucker carlson hey buddy we support your
[2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:03.880]  free speech you need to talk about this it's fascinating to me that tucker carlson today
[2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:10.440]  sounds a lot like the questions that you were asking three years ago or even shan hannity today
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:15.080]  or even rush limbaugh which i i like right right that's what i'm saying that they have they are
[2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:19.560]  eventually coming around to asking the questions that need to be asked all these roads when you
[2:25:19.560 --> 2:25:24.600]  begin asking you eventually get to info wars because info wars is always pioneering asking
[2:25:24.600 --> 2:25:28.920]  the tough questions trailblazing the let's just be clear only because we're really trying to
[2:25:28.920 --> 2:25:33.160]  figure stuff out i know everybody else gets a talking point like what's our agenda let's say
[2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:37.640]  this no people go why does jones say one thing one week another next because we we're figuring it
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:42.200]  out yeah that's right that's right you're analyzing it and you're asking real questions no one hands
[2:25:42.200 --> 2:25:46.520]  you a script of what to say every day no one hands me a script and by the way that's why you go on
[2:25:46.520 --> 2:25:50.440]  almost any other show they like want to control it and that's right what are we going to do right
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:55.400]  and any given day by the way like my podcast and your broadcasts they are totally different
[2:25:55.400 --> 2:26:00.200]  they don't match up except maybe by rare coincidence why is that because no one tells us what to say
[2:26:00.200 --> 2:26:05.240]  it's it's not but even look at the four networks it was always same ads same order same newscast
[2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:10.360]  exactly but my point is even these mainstream people like you know rush limbaugh or shon hannity
[2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:14.520]  you know hannity today he's been going down that rabbit hole more and more looking at because that's
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:19.800]  where it is exactly and notice he got even bigger exactly he's having more success by the way the
[2:26:19.800 --> 2:26:24.200]  word is they've got the knives out they have threatened him oh of course everything but
[2:26:24.200 --> 2:26:28.920]  he has a radio show that's even bigger so they know anywhere he goes if he went to a new network
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:33.560]  tv be a whole new flocks you know that guy is way more powerful than roger else ever was he
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:37.160]  made he wanted to go start the thing he could do that's why they're still keeping him there
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:41.320]  and they don't know what to do yep yep uh you know i think hannity made a decision that
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:45.240]  he's willing to risk his entire career to help protect the people that were in the meetings
[2:26:45.240 --> 2:26:49.560]  oh really they called him in and said get your stuff you're fired yeah and then he does it back
[2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:53.960]  down and they go okay well we're thinking not surprised but that's why i i respect people
[2:26:53.960 --> 2:26:57.960]  like that and i respect tucker tucker carlson for what he does i know he's got limits and
[2:26:57.960 --> 2:27:01.800]  boundaries and things he's not willing to do but i respect at least he's willing to ask sure all
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:05.960]  i'm saying is that no one in the media except matt drudge of drudge report dot com would actually
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:10.120]  put the video up to me saying yeah we believe kids died we do not believe the crisis actors there
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:14.840]  was a stand down here's our video about a stand down and about multiple shooters and then right
[2:27:15.720 --> 2:27:19.960]  who needs seeing it it had seven million years this is the key though the banning of your speech
[2:27:19.960 --> 2:27:25.480]  and taking away your first amendment rights is so that you cannot respond to the false allegations
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:31.240]  again so they can say i said i want to have sex with children when i didn't this is the whole point
[2:27:31.240 --> 2:27:34.920]  first they want to disarm all of you take away your right to self-defense and then they want to
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:40.360]  silence you and take away your right to defend yourself verbally against the false attacks and
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:44.840]  the false allegations and the defamation attempts that are routinely level but i like the good news
[2:27:44.840 --> 2:27:48.360]  you said we'll play the clips next segment i like what you said this is true more and more
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:53.240]  conservative libertarian groups yep the happening i've never really i want to put this on air and
[2:27:53.240 --> 2:27:57.800]  get the enemy ideas but it's exciting just like i went and spent $300,000 on limbaugh show and
[2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:01.320]  they're trying to get it canceled five years ago plus the price was half of what normally was so we
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:04.760]  actually you know sold a lot of product it was successes for us but we helped him i told other
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:08.760]  people go sponsored and bought people big people did several big food companies i knew some other
[2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:12.040]  folks went and did it we propped him up when they were trying to bring him down because we did it
[2:28:12.040 --> 2:28:16.600]  was the first big domino right so it was self-preservation i'm just like being this loving
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:21.720]  person for the first amendment which that was secondary yes i believe that we have had behind
[2:28:21.720 --> 2:28:27.160]  the scenes some of the biggest organizations and groups that are patriotic launched a massive
[2:28:27.160 --> 2:28:35.000]  sponsorship for us uh in in you know areas and again because they get it they understand
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:39.880]  right right this is why i support what you do because i know they're coming for you they're
[2:28:39.880 --> 2:28:43.320]  also coming for me they're coming for every independent media person they're coming for

[2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:52.120]  but speaking about the dirty tricks that are going on i'm actually proud of people that
[2:33:52.120 --> 2:33:55.960]  have been around me over the years most of them that they haven't taken the payoffs yeah
[2:33:55.960 --> 2:34:01.160]  but i've recently learned that some of that's actually going on and these papers admit to me
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:05.000]  that they're actually paying money when they call me but then they never have the way most
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:09.080]  to run with it because they know it's such bull and they know i'm looking to sue somebody because
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:13.160]  i got to because i just can't let people set oppression and to make these lies up but you
[2:34:13.160 --> 2:34:17.160]  look at other people who put up with it they get one person to tell a lie then they get another
[2:34:17.160 --> 2:34:21.400]  another another to set a precedent and they can have me riding unicorns around you know having
[2:34:21.400 --> 2:34:27.880]  sex with purple dwarves right and you know 18 midgets when they're done i mean and so when media
[2:34:27.880 --> 2:34:33.240]  since trump got elected went from being deceptive and manipulative going wait we're losing we better
[2:34:33.240 --> 2:34:38.680]  get 50 times more deceptive well yeah um a couple of things i'll mention here since you brought it
[2:34:38.680 --> 2:34:47.000]  up many years ago i was offered $50,000 to uh to go public trashing you with made-up stuff
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:52.360]  and i told them where they can stick it and they threatened and said well if you don't do this
[2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:57.000]  we're going to come after you and i just said bring it i don't care yeah you know everybody
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:01.560]  you know look i stand for liberty and republic and truth and natural health and good science and
[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:07.160]  all these things go for it do what you want to do because i'm not going to tear down other
[2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:12.360]  patriots okay so that's one thing uh i was also we were offered $10 million to sell
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:17.320]  natural news a couple of years ago by the way that's not a lot you've got some of the biggest
[2:35:17.320 --> 2:35:21.400]  sites out there no that people don't know how big your operation is you've got publishing all over
[2:35:21.400 --> 2:35:25.560]  the world i mean you're you're probably bigger than info wars no i don't know about that i mean
[2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:30.280]  well your warehouse sure as is well we we we have grown a lot like you have grown over the last few
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:33.960]  years because we're doing things right and well we understand they're trying to destroy us you either
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:39.400]  get bigger under attack or you implode but you know like you i made a decision long ago there is no
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:45.560]  amount of money that you can buy me off and silence my voice you i will never turn against
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:51.000]  they already tried to take my kids and basically said you back off this all ends i look i will never
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:55.800]  give up my second amendment rights ever under any but if i gave into that they will never get
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:36:00.520]  them anyways with the whole system they don't understand you can't sell out folks right there
[2:36:00.520 --> 2:36:05.560]  is no selling out they can still they could try to damage you they but you got to make them work
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:09.640]  for it you know what i mean there are no freebies here if you want to destroy alex jones or destroy
[2:36:09.640 --> 2:36:13.960]  the health ranger you're gonna have to work for it what's where does the average person in media
[2:36:13.960 --> 2:36:18.600]  loves to be bought off for nothing i know they roll over like it's winning nothing you bought
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:22.040]  that to me is like thousand dollars like the only thing i fear like the only time i feel empty and
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:25.640]  like scared is when i think about selling out and not that i even think about it i just even
[2:36:25.640 --> 2:36:31.480]  entertain the idea i'm like like i mean it's it's the fear of god what is that well but the more
[2:36:31.480 --> 2:36:36.680]  that this happens to people like us and the stronger we become we they actually make us stronger
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:40.680]  because we i was gonna say that earlier that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger it does
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:45.960]  which is a scary thing because internally you decide what you stand for what your life is here
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:50.920]  for what your mission is it's to to defend this republic to defend truth and honesty to defend
[2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:55.800]  real journalism for example to defend our second amendment rights because we know the genocide
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:36:59.640]  that happens historically when governments have them unless the thing now that's why i'm really
[2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:04.920]  concerned the enemy's worse than i even thought i mean we they we are up against solid evil that
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:10.440]  just wants to hurt and destroy things we've got to fight folks we've got to do this no question
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:16.760]  there is a spiritual element there's almost like a demonic overlay to the evil that's out there that
[2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:20.680]  is by the way i mean you're a spiritual guy everything but years ago you weren't even i mean
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:24.200]  you're an engineer top engineer you've been that's why you originally made your bones
[2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:28.280]  software yeah and you're like more and more now this is demonic like no i get it now
[2:37:28.280 --> 2:37:32.760]  you know i mean over the last few years it's become very very clear to me that this is a
[2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:37.080]  spiritual war and that these demonic because people will go out of their way to even hurt
[2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:43.160]  themselves to hurt good oh it's it's it's unreal they will go at look these the leftists they do
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:47.720]  not want their children protected in the schools with armed guards or better security and they
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:52.760]  all put them on a bunch of psychotropics and hurt them they do they hurt their own children
[2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:58.520]  but what kind of psychopaths seriously it's their religion it's it's it's like child sacrifice it's
[2:37:58.520 --> 2:38:02.840]  like the the the mayan or the aztec cultures they would sacrifice a certain number of children
[2:38:02.840 --> 2:38:07.240]  well today how do they do it how do they say well they they've got abortion sacrifice right
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:12.760]  partial birth abortions the baby is coming out could be alive could be welcomed into the world
[2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:19.160]  could be a future student at parkland florida how many kids were not present in that high school
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:23.720]  because they were more murdered as they were being born there's the big question that nobody's
[2:38:23.720 --> 2:38:28.520]  asking don't worry plan parenthood sponsoring the anti-gun children and and and so here's
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:33.320]  the choice people have to make life or death it really comes down to that that's exactly and
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:40.360]  the globalist are a cult of death no question about it they they seek destruction they use
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:47.960]  anger as a weapon to destroy light to destroy life they attack christians they attack people
[2:38:47.960 --> 2:38:53.720]  who believe in divinity or god or creation in people to believe in anything but them
[2:38:54.440 --> 2:39:00.840]  yeah yeah yeah and and by the way they think that their existence is over when they die
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:05.960]  because they don't believe in the soul or the non-physical spirit they are living this life as
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:11.080]  a suicide mission because they believe it ends when they die everything about that and that's
[2:39:11.080 --> 2:39:14.440]  their overall operating system but they're mainly just pissed because they know they're already cut
[2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:19.960]  off from it well they i don't i don't know if they can be redeemed for some of them for what
[2:39:19.960 --> 2:39:26.360]  they're doing but make no mistake i am here and i believe you are here to protect life we are here
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:32.440]  to protect children and if that means putting competent trained armed personnel in the schools
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:36.440]  to protect our children that is a common sense and by the way do the psychological profile like
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:40.760]  trump said maybe 20 where we're getting that great great advice those people that actually care about
[2:39:40.760 --> 2:39:45.800]  kids not some sheriff they can be ordered to stand down right by hillary sheriff and all this but no
[2:39:45.800 --> 2:39:49.000]  people that are there they're not going to stand down you know it's amazing to me that leftists
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:53.400]  they love to have armed guards protect their money in the banks they love to have armed guards protect
[2:39:53.400 --> 2:39:57.720]  them at a football event they're all about our guards you get around leftist they've got all the
[2:39:57.720 --> 2:40:01.960]  body of course hillary clinton surrounded by armed guards right they've got guns why to protect
[2:40:01.960 --> 2:40:08.120]  hillary clinton and everybody has a right to be protected but why not your children why not your
[2:40:08.120 --> 2:40:13.240]  children you're gonna protect there you by the way there there are already thousands of schools
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:18.200]  that have armed principals and select teachers and that's the absolute way to go a lot of these
[2:40:18.200 --> 2:40:22.280]  years are former police officers or they're former military but they're just in their patriots and
[2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:26.680]  then they won't be soft targets why do they why do all the shooters are on serotonin rip ticket
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:32.040]  embers why do they all have the same bushmaster the same hour of 15 right where did he get the
[2:40:32.040 --> 2:40:37.080]  money to buy 10 firearms i don't know the answer that he didn't have just in november i there's a
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:41.240]  police report they would do without snow guns nothing you know you know i try i do tactical
[2:40:41.240 --> 2:40:45.560]  firearms training i've done it for years with former military and i'm around a lot of cops and
[2:40:45.560 --> 2:40:49.240]  a lot of deputies and i've had conversations with them since the shooting and they tell me
[2:40:49.240 --> 2:40:53.160]  every one of them they are beside themselves they cannot understand why those deputies didn't
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:40:57.720]  rush in we all know if all you got to do is return five we all know they reported multiple
[2:40:57.720 --> 2:41:02.520]  shooters in full paramilitary garb and multiple witnesses they were with crews he was not shooting
[2:41:02.520 --> 2:41:06.840]  and the cover-up the way they've acted desperately as he's been acting questions
[2:41:06.840 --> 2:41:11.880]  and misrepresenting what we said it's because evidence now swings towards it being more synthetic
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:16.760]  than just a basic false flag of a standout yeah of course and that's like nicholas cruise was there
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:22.360]  he was active but there was someone else at least who was active as well that's i think the
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:28.520]  testimony of what's her name lapel stacey lapel there's teachers and everybody right she said
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:32.840]  the first she saw the shooter and she said immediately that was a policeman remember
[2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:37.720]  that was her quote and meanwhile cruise a little bitty guy right and she said what full face mask
[2:41:37.720 --> 2:41:43.000]  body armor full metal garb was that her quote yeah that's not nicholas cruise that's not the guy they
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:50.280]  arrested it was full i mean Darth Vader body armor yeah that's her right there uh what is that abc news
[2:41:50.280 --> 2:41:54.760]  or cbs was that and they've been deleting this off online that's what the students said they said
[2:41:54.760 --> 2:41:59.080]  oh i'm with cruise he's not shooting people no god but then these army men are shooting people
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:02.760]  and we're not saying the army that's just how students see it right but see that this is how
[2:42:02.760 --> 2:42:08.200]  these things work they are allowed to unfold and then they are augmented so you know the carnage
[2:42:08.200 --> 2:42:13.080]  is real like i said but the narrative is fake the carnage is real the carnage was allowed to then
[2:42:13.080 --> 2:42:19.800]  they seize the crisis and embellish it exactly exactly it's the same pattern every time and by
[2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:24.600]  the way this goes all the way back to you know think about the clinton era bill clinton the
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:29.720]  events that took place before info wars existed before the independent media existed i'm talking
[2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:34.680]  about oklahoma city where the mainstream media had the entire narrative think about that wow
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:37.720]  and then and then even local news got it right because they weren't in on it they were just
[2:42:37.720 --> 2:42:41.080]  told to change it we're like there's the multiple bombs and the police said yeah we caught bombs
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:46.120]  inside yep they there be that you know the people in hud they said yeah i saw people in there putting
[2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:51.720]  gray sticks of butter in the in the we need to revisit all these mass killing events throughout

[2:47:15.800 --> 2:47:22.680]  i will say william talking to more and more democratic leaders uh democratic policy people
[2:47:22.680 --> 2:47:27.720]  who are concerned that the democrats have everything on their side but they don't have
[2:47:27.720 --> 2:47:32.440]  the unifying message right and a lot of people that were concerned that hillary clinton was going
[2:47:32.440 --> 2:47:37.800]  to lose in the democratic party are saying still they still don't have a message for the common
[2:47:37.800 --> 2:47:44.120]  good it's for this group you've been you know you've been treated badly group a and the democrats
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:48.200]  are going to take care of you group b you've been treated badly and this is what we're going to do
[2:47:48.200 --> 2:47:54.040]  to take care of you in group c you're being treated badly and this is what we and group d uh and
[2:47:54.840 --> 2:48:00.920]  so many democratic strategists say that if you even talk about how this democratic party
[2:48:00.920 --> 2:48:08.200]  balkanizes voters instead of looking for the common good for all americans that you're suddenly
[2:48:08.200 --> 2:48:14.920]  called a racist or or you're attacked and you're shunned from the party yeah now people ask why
[2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:18.840]  does scarborough who's a horrible guy say things like that it's simple they know they're losing
[2:48:18.840 --> 2:48:24.040]  their base audience with this constant race war division and they know that once they've radicalized
[2:48:24.040 --> 2:48:29.960]  with 99 racism and division the minority groups they're brainwashing already been radicalized
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:36.520]  so that he just adds that to make it sound like oh what have we done it it's so terrible it's like
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:42.040]  facebook oh study show we're making you commit suicide so now we'll monitor you and we'll run a
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:47.560]  medical company that we direct you to so you can you get your psychiatric help they've got the whole
[2:48:47.560 --> 2:48:54.200]  sick actuary for full spectrum dominance figured out yeah it is sick they control your mind they
[2:48:54.200 --> 2:48:59.000]  chemically influence you they have disinformation and of course they use social engineering that's
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:03.640]  the most powerful part is to make it so that if you don't conform with your liberal friends that
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:09.320]  you will be an outcast that's incredibly powerful to young people because they're so invested in
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:13.800]  social conformity and wanting to be liked and you heard me earlier break it down i've talked to
[2:49:13.800 --> 2:49:18.280]  facebook executives and others and former ones but they say it's already almost there where you
[2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:23.160]  don't really ever hardly talk to anybody real and and everything you put through is already being
[2:49:23.160 --> 2:49:26.840]  censored and controlled at the point of posting to where you're going to be all alone in your own
[2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:32.040]  little cell mainly just communicating with advertising and social engineering bots right
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:37.800]  that are controlled i mean this is super immoral and it's meant to keep you depressed about regular
[2:49:37.800 --> 2:49:43.000]  life and keep you in facebook did you see that scientists were warning recently that children
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:48.200]  are unable to hold pencils now because they're using mobile devices yes to such and you can't hold
[2:49:48.200 --> 2:49:54.920]  pencils i mean what alex they don't they don't even want to go to let me tell you something most
[2:49:54.920 --> 2:49:58.360]  parents i don't say they're children don't even want to eat dinner whether they act like it's
[2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:04.280]  punishment to sit and talk well i mean you gotta want there's don't have the strength to grip a
[2:50:04.280 --> 2:50:08.360]  pencil yeah they don't have the strength to grip but yeah grip strength is disappearing it makes you
[2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:12.760]  wonder you know people who have a rural lifestyle and they're working on a ranch or a farm or something
[2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:16.280]  and you know the carrion buckets or bags of grain you know they've got physical strength they can
[2:50:16.280 --> 2:50:20.760]  actually do something the real world they could change a tire on a car you know so many of these
[2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:26.760]  city liberals who are ultra protected kind of the snowflake generation they cannot use their
[2:50:26.760 --> 2:50:32.040]  fingers for anything other than texting and snapchatting and that's it they're locked into it
[2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:35.640]  and they have the food delivered a little coffin apartment and they kind of go over and do it
[2:50:35.640 --> 2:50:40.760]  and they revel in the weakness it's like omega man it's like omega man where he has the cure
[2:50:40.760 --> 2:50:44.760]  to the ming dead zombies they go dude we don't want it we like this it makes you wonder how they
[2:50:44.760 --> 2:50:49.320]  think they're going to succeed in a revolution attempt if they can't pick up a pencil how you
[2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:54.200]  know how are they going to pick up well when you look at antifa with their with their you know
[2:50:54.200 --> 2:51:00.040]  ak47s out there threatening us because they look like they can hardly hold the rifles up i bet they
[2:51:00.040 --> 2:51:05.240]  don't even know how to properly load and cycle around in an ak47 i think they don't know how to
[2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:10.120]  do it they don't know that it goes click when the magazine is out it doesn't have a bolt lock when
[2:51:10.120 --> 2:51:13.880]  it's out they don't know and if that's the case it's our fault we let it happen we're gonna we're

[3:00:59.640 --> 3:01:03.080]  us some of the big tidbits you've got coming up in this hour before we go back to these calls
[3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:11.560]  well alex incredibly uh a top aide to john mccain david kramer has pled the fifth amendment
[3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:19.480]  uh in the russian dossier probe kramer is the guy that mccain sent to london to retrieve the bogus
[3:01:19.480 --> 3:01:27.240]  document and bring it back so that senator mccain could present it to the fbi when is john mccain
[3:01:27.240 --> 3:01:34.920]  going to answer questions under oath about his role in this whole sordid shady unconstitutional
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:42.920]  affair well i don't know he's fighting for his life right now well look we all wish him a speedy
[3:01:42.920 --> 3:01:48.840]  recovery regarding his health ailments but alex that doesn't excuse the fact that this is a guy
[3:01:48.840 --> 3:01:55.080]  who said the russian collusion was worse than watergate that barack obama was a better president
[3:01:55.080 --> 3:02:00.680]  than donald trump i mean this is not the john mccain that i knew 30 years ago when he came to
[3:02:00.680 --> 3:02:09.240]  washington as a reform oriented conservative uh i really think he is bent with bitterness and envy
[3:02:09.240 --> 3:02:13.960]  for the fact that donald trump became president and john mccain did not that's right all right
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:18.360]  that's coming up we're gonna go just do these calls in order travis michael jeff tom right down
[3:02:18.360 --> 3:02:22.280]  through him travis in texas you're on the air concerning the attack on the second amendment
[3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:28.600]  nbc news says ban the second amendment repeal it go ahead travis well while i'm loading my ar 10
[3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:33.880]  magazines right now with 308 so never mind that ar 15 stuff i like the bigger calibers but here you
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:39.880]  i just wanted to say i uh use your products i want to endorse you there so just want to talk about
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:44.680]  the event we put on this last weekend it was a shooting competition they're called running guns
[3:02:44.680 --> 3:02:50.920]  and we ran five and a quarter miles we ran 174 competitors through nine stages pretty much everybody
[3:02:50.920 --> 3:02:58.440]  had ar 15s or that like we assuming a 50 percent hit ratio on those stages we fired somewhere in
[3:02:58.440 --> 3:03:04.120]  the order of 38 000 rounds and no one got hurt no one got shot or anything like that so i'm
[3:03:04.120 --> 3:03:08.760]  preaching to the preachers here but that's that's how it goes down yeah what do you know putting
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:12.520]  rounds on target where you intend now that's awesome because they're they're trying to delete
[3:03:12.520 --> 3:03:17.080]  regular shooting ranges websites they're trying to harass everybody we've got to stand together
[3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:24.120]  right on well travis sounds like your crew knows how to handle themselves so congratulations well
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:29.000]  travis hitting the good news too the nra is getting record donations yeah they are absolutely i think
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:35.080]  so absolutely yeah that's great i kind of like gun owners of american myself but hey no no i agree
[3:03:35.080 --> 3:03:39.960]  i remember gun owners was the only strong group but we're getting the nra better and they're the
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:46.040]  main target that's why i'm saying we're supporting them does that make sense right on yeah well god
[3:03:46.040 --> 3:03:51.720]  bless you travis anything else that is all right thank you roger you want to comment on this thing
[3:03:51.720 --> 3:03:57.560]  you're right there in broward county i know you know sheriff vengazi uh but but i agree that's not
[3:03:57.560 --> 3:04:01.960]  the main focus it's the psychotropic drugs and the fact that after the police already visited him a
[3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:08.200]  bunch no one wanted to prosecute him you know in all honesty alex said the fact that our local
[3:04:08.200 --> 3:04:13.560]  sheriff has become an advocate for gun control turns my stomach you know i don't think he's a
[3:04:13.560 --> 3:04:19.720]  bad guy but i never said he was a conservative or a republican uh as a result of one of the calls
[3:04:19.720 --> 3:04:28.040]  to bsso uh cruise was remanded to the state for uh an involuntary psychological counseling and
[3:04:28.040 --> 3:04:34.840]  medication two and a half months later they the state doctors certified him as being safe so uh
[3:04:34.840 --> 3:04:40.440]  this is an entire cauldron of of failure that we're talking about in these shootings that's right
[3:04:40.440 --> 3:04:45.480]  just enforced the laws we have in almost every case like the texas church shooting he'd been fully
[3:04:45.480 --> 3:04:51.240]  adjudicated to learn a tech escape from a mental asylum in a military base and then got guns illegally

[3:06:30.520 --> 3:06:36.360]  but i mentioned this yesterday today i've never got to it so let's play got like five of these
[3:06:36.360 --> 3:06:43.320]  clips but let's play at least one of these tom fountes implies women can't carry guns because
[3:06:43.320 --> 3:06:49.720]  they wear skirts that's singing in now let's go ahead and play this unintentional comedy here it is
[3:06:50.280 --> 3:06:54.360]  one of the things that people don't talk about a lot of these schools sandy hook had an all
[3:06:54.360 --> 3:07:00.760]  female faculty from principal to teachers and for a woman were you going to hide that gun during
[3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:04.200]  the day you can't put it in your desk drawer somebody might steal it you can't get to it
[3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:08.440]  you're not going to have it in a safe in the principal's office you can't get to it on your
[3:07:08.440 --> 3:07:14.840]  person if you wear a dress if you wear a skirt are you going to have to wear a jacket every day
[3:07:14.840 --> 3:07:20.920]  with a belt and a holster the way a detective you know on duty would do it's it's not a real
[3:07:20.920 --> 3:07:27.160]  practical solution even for a variety of reasons that's total fraud i have right here in the desk
[3:07:27.160 --> 3:07:32.600]  and it's an access pistol safe that's biometric at my house i've got them where it's the four
[3:07:32.600 --> 3:07:37.160]  finger control you program it it's very easy to know kids can't get into it nobody but but it's
[3:07:37.160 --> 3:07:43.720]  there and it's so condescending that they couldn't have an instant access pistol safe for those that
[3:07:43.720 --> 3:07:48.760]  opt in that are trained goes to the course and and then again that a woman can't do that let's
[3:07:48.760 --> 3:07:55.400]  get roger stones take on that and then mike adams access is part of the same failed idea that if
[3:07:55.400 --> 3:08:01.480]  you somehow outlaw and prohibit guns that they won't be plentiful the government wants outlawed
[3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:07.320]  alcohol during prohibition it was plentiful today we outlawed drugs do you think drugs can't be
[3:08:07.320 --> 3:08:11.800]  found on the streets look at mexico look at total gun ban for the citizens highest crime rate in the
[3:08:11.800 --> 3:08:17.960]  world so the idea that if we banned guns that all that would do would would make it difficult for
[3:08:17.960 --> 3:08:24.440]  law-abiding citizens to own firearms the outlaws the criminals the miscreants the nutjobs they'll
[3:08:24.440 --> 3:08:30.520]  always be able to find a gun it's just it's warped thinking by the liberals and then they
[3:08:30.520 --> 3:08:36.280]  they add this argument look i know some very some women who are extraordinary shots who would be
[3:08:36.280 --> 3:08:41.880]  very offended by that video it's crazy and of course we talked about dick sporting goods
[3:08:41.880 --> 3:08:49.160]  since we mentioned it let's play dicks ceo who is a real well the name of the store i mean it's
[3:08:49.160 --> 3:08:55.000]  constant it's constantly i was a bunch of the jokes i can make i'm not going to do it the
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:08:59.400]  listeners don't like it and i'm sorry i'm gonna stop but uh you know have you been dicked over
[3:08:59.400 --> 3:09:06.120]  today by dicks dick sporting goods made sure gun retailer stopped selling assault rifles really giving
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:10.360]  a royal screwing to the second amendment when again assault rifles have even used their definition
[3:09:10.360 --> 3:09:14.280]  are used in less than two percent of the crimes but they obsess on them because they can ban those
[3:09:14.280 --> 3:09:21.640]  they can ban them all let's play uh the ceo of uh a place whose name is now dicks go ahead
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:27.960]  we looked at what happened down in parkland and uh we were we were so disturbed and saddened by
[3:09:27.960 --> 3:09:32.600]  what happened we felt we really needed to do something the first year so we've decided not
[3:09:32.600 --> 3:09:37.080]  to sell these assault weapons any longer in any of our stores and the other things that we talked
[3:09:37.080 --> 3:09:42.360]  about yeah and and and the shooter uh down in parkland actually bought a gun at a dick store
[3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:49.320]  not the assault weapon right he did and and uh he bought a a shotgun from us back in in november
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:53.640]  and it wasn't the gun nor was it the type of gun that uh can you imagine like if somebody like
[3:09:53.640 --> 3:09:58.040]  this is lamasus that ran over bunch of people in new yorkan killed him and and we said it was his
[3:09:58.040 --> 3:10:01.400]  lamasus he screamed i'll lock barren was the media said that was fake news and banned our
[3:10:01.400 --> 3:10:08.040]  number one tweet talking about it paul watson's imagine if they'd have said the name of the
[3:10:08.040 --> 3:10:13.240]  vehicle and they had the ceo of the company on i think it was i think it was a big mercedes truck
[3:10:13.240 --> 3:10:18.600]  and said we're we're really sorry that we we sell a lot of mercedes trucks and you know he stole
[3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:23.480]  this mercedes truck but we're really sorry it's a mercedes truck this is the death of
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:30.200]  logic and i will never go to dicks again well will dicks feel bad about all the people who
[3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:35.720]  fail to defend themselves because they have a home invasion and they can't defend themselves with a
[3:10:35.720 --> 3:10:42.760]  highly effective legal firearm which he calls an assault rifle i just call a good firearm i mean
[3:10:42.760 --> 3:10:49.960]  300 blackout suppressed ar style a short barreled rifle great for home defense that's why you need
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:56.920]  them well i gotta say i mean i was never into dicks but it was close to my house so i would go
[3:10:56.920 --> 3:11:01.800]  there sometimes to get golf balls or tennis balls or you know my children you know had grown
[3:11:01.800 --> 3:11:06.920]  out of their exercise clothes for tennis or track or whatever it was i mean i'm i'm i mean i'm over
[3:11:06.920 --> 3:11:12.920]  there uh at least once a month i am not going back in there to be raped by these anti gunners
[3:11:12.920 --> 3:11:18.520]  exactly me neither i mean the dicks is no screwing america over hey you you make an economic choice
[3:11:18.520 --> 3:11:23.560]  and you choose who to support and who not to support what why do you think the ceo of uh
[3:11:24.520 --> 3:11:32.040]  of this organization ed stack is virtually signaling like this roger well i mean interestingly
[3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:38.680]  enough alix he makes a point there which is that crews the parkland shooter bought a gun at dicks
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:46.040]  because crews have been involuntarily uh uh seized by the state under state law shouldn't
[3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:52.280]  have a boom boom and shouldn't been able to get one under the ncis registry system so again
[3:11:52.280 --> 3:11:59.160]  they're failing to enforce the laws we do have in this rush to add new yeah why is it always
[3:11:59.160 --> 3:12:04.440]  leftist areas with some guy in government custody on a bunch of drugs and the sheriffs always stand
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:08.440]  down and it's always an ar-15 i mean who's coming up with this script i'm not saying the shootings
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:13.480]  aren't happening but out of thousands of guns why is it always the same story that's some crazy
[3:12:13.480 --> 3:12:17.800]  eyed lun under government control yeah by the way dicks sporting goods half the stuff they sell
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:21.880]  is made in china anyway they don't seem to have a pro america stance to begin with you can find
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:25.960]  better i'll say this they don't have you know any employees in there either oh really i can't ever
[3:12:26.600 --> 3:12:32.600]  ask for help can't you help well hey i would just say people support your local small gun shops
[3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:36.840]  who are probably more knowledgeable than people at dicks sporting that's the thing i never buy guns
[3:12:36.840 --> 3:12:41.400]  at big places because they're always so rude and weird yeah that's like you're weird buying a gun
[3:12:41.400 --> 3:12:46.360]  and they always have like some commie behind the thing like right right well i'm sure you
[3:12:46.360 --> 3:12:52.040]  gotta look it's always been at man buns don't get me started uh roger you got a comment on
[3:12:52.040 --> 3:12:56.680]  there's this or we go the next call hey would you like to have a man bun roger no i'll pass
[3:12:56.680 --> 3:13:02.680]  on i'll pass on that look the whole role of psychotropic drugs in these shootings when we
[3:13:02.680 --> 3:13:08.360]  just try to discuss it to have an open discussion of it uh you know we're immediately attacked
[3:13:08.360 --> 3:13:13.400]  as conspiring to ban the video where we said what is the cause of mass shootings and we said it's not
[3:13:13.400 --> 3:13:20.600]  acting they're on these drugs and they banned that yep it's indisputable that as a result of one of
[3:13:20.600 --> 3:13:28.200]  the citizen calls regarding complaint about crews that the state baker acted him took him into custody
[3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:34.520]  submitted him for psychological treatment and counseling and they medicated him uh and it
[3:13:34.520 --> 3:13:40.360]  sure made it better didn't it his mommy his adopted mother had just died and then they
[3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:44.360]  put him on psychotropic that was a really good move yeah exactly he was already talking about
[3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:48.040]  being a school shooter you know the answer is let's put you on some psychotropic
[3:13:50.280 --> 3:13:55.320]  that says on the inside it can make you kill people uh alex is one thing i want to comment on

[3:20:36.280 --> 3:20:40.760]  well folks uh our phone system is crashed for some bizarre reason and they tell me well it's
[3:20:40.760 --> 3:20:44.200]  kind of an old comrades we have a new four thousand dollar system the answer is yes i
[3:20:44.200 --> 3:20:49.000]  wonder why it used to crash once a year now it's every other time we open the phones up too many
[3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:54.040]  calls so it's a word well it i mean the system is can take thousands it just lit up it was like
[3:20:54.040 --> 3:20:58.440]  roger you've got a lot to get into about what's going on mike adams this year i i have to tell
[3:20:58.440 --> 3:21:03.240]  folks though and i'm going to read this and then decide how to respond already stand over it i
[3:21:03.240 --> 3:21:08.120]  i we know for years that they've had media for so-called media going around the same folks that
[3:21:08.120 --> 3:21:14.360]  created the pp dossier story and all that trying to get people to make stuff up and this this and
[3:21:14.360 --> 3:21:18.840]  when the so-called paper this well-known tabloid called me a few weeks ago i said did you pay
[3:21:18.840 --> 3:21:24.440]  these individuals they said no comment and so during the break they gave me a 33 page report
[3:21:24.440 --> 3:21:33.720]  and i was looking over it and fantastic um fantastical theater fantastical fiction uh
[3:21:33.720 --> 3:21:38.200]  but i don't know how mainstream media works they're not going to ever let me respond anyways
[3:21:38.200 --> 3:21:43.480]  but to the audience i'm going to respond but it's just they're trying to take our online sponsors
[3:21:43.480 --> 3:21:47.960]  they're trying to shut us down they're all over the news and they don't even care they then launched
[3:21:47.960 --> 3:21:54.120]  this in the middle of everything after buzzfeed moved here a reporter for six months contacting
[3:21:54.120 --> 3:21:59.240]  everyone trying to get them to say something that wasn't true and what was great was nobody did
[3:21:59.240 --> 3:22:07.080]  well finally somebody did so uh we're going to uh get to this this is unbelievable and i told them
[3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:11.640]  i said i'm going to have to take legal action the mail probably daily mail but obviously of the
[3:22:11.640 --> 3:22:18.680]  individuals because it's like crazy the level of disinformation or taking some kernel of truth
[3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:23.480]  like i'm having a debate with david duke and i'm saying he's a bad guy and then he calls somebody
[3:22:23.480 --> 3:22:27.400]  uh you know by their ethnicity because they're religious they want to come on the show and
[3:22:27.400 --> 3:22:31.960]  told me they wanted to come on was that and then that becomes i did that i mean it's it's or like
[3:22:31.960 --> 3:22:35.880]  we we had guns everywhere and it scared people we had the person on video
[3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:40.840]  asked thanking them for putting them in a concealed carry class so it's like each piece of it
[3:22:40.840 --> 3:22:45.800]  because we'd already seen you know the claims it is false it doesn't even hurt me because
[3:22:45.800 --> 3:22:51.240]  this is what i've expected i mean this is imagine what trump's going through imagine and thanks to
[3:22:51.240 --> 3:22:57.720]  you supporting us listeners it's just incredible but next level uh roger stone and that you're
[3:22:57.720 --> 3:23:02.680]  being polite roger loves to hear people talk uh other big stuff on your radar mike well i would
[3:23:02.680 --> 3:23:07.640]  say roger you can hear me right roger yes indeed go ahead mike i've got a couple big questions for
[3:23:07.640 --> 3:23:14.040]  you right now about florida about broward county do you do you know any of those deputies or are
[3:23:14.040 --> 3:23:20.360]  you aware of any reason why a deputy would would stand down would even take that order to not enter
[3:23:20.360 --> 3:23:24.680]  his school because that seems contradictory to everything i've ever seen about law enforcement
[3:23:24.680 --> 3:23:31.320]  training what's your take on that well first of all because of the way our 911 call system is set
[3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:38.280]  up in the county this initial call shots fired actually goes to the coral ridge municipal
[3:23:38.280 --> 3:23:45.480]  police department uh the coral ridge does not participate in the county wide 911 system run
[3:23:45.480 --> 3:23:52.280]  by the sheriff's office therefore the officers from coral ridge show up in swatton here the
[3:23:52.280 --> 3:23:59.960]  officers from the sheriff's office i am told do not they both arrived at approximately the same
[3:23:59.960 --> 3:24:06.840]  time but by that time the shooter has already fled the premises and is no longer at the school
[3:24:06.840 --> 3:24:13.400]  so when they arrived unfortunately the one officer who was armed the one officer whose
[3:24:13.400 --> 3:24:20.040]  duty it was to go in there and take the guy out did nothing he he let headquarters know that
[3:24:20.040 --> 3:24:27.480]  shots had been fired he told them to set up a perimeter but he did not do his duty uh and
[3:24:27.480 --> 3:24:33.080]  there is the epic failure here that's my question by the time by the time all of the other law
[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:38.440]  enforcement officers arrived the shooter had already left the building this this seems to go
[3:24:38.440 --> 3:24:43.240]  against every piece of training because active shooter scenario training is the number one form
[3:24:43.240 --> 3:24:48.280]  of training that law enforcement officers get sheriff's deputies police swat teams you name it
[3:24:48.280 --> 3:24:53.720]  and every single one of them is trained that even if they are the one man or woman on the scene
[3:24:53.720 --> 3:24:59.560]  they go in and at minimum you can lay down return fire you can pin the bad guy you can create
[3:24:59.560 --> 3:25:04.200]  shrapnel if the bad guy's not wearing eye protection you can blind him with shrapnel from
[3:25:04.200 --> 3:25:10.360]  bullets hitting bricks on the wall whatever it takes it does it seems unreal to me that anyone
[3:25:10.360 --> 3:25:16.280]  would on their own volition refuse to go in and engage a shooter when they are law enforcement it
[3:25:16.280 --> 3:25:21.320]  just doesn't make sense to me but what's extraordinary here mike is that this particular
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:28.040]  officer had actually taught swap management tactics and how shooters are supposed to react
[3:25:28.040 --> 3:25:36.040]  he's a 37 year veteran whose training was completely upgraded and and revised post columbine
[3:25:36.760 --> 3:25:43.160]  and still he froze the president called him a coward the sheriff called him a coward there's the
[3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:50.520]  epic failure by the time any other law enforcement arrived the shooter had already left the building
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:54.840]  what does this mean roger when people say give up all your guns the government will protect you
[3:25:54.840 --> 3:25:59.240]  because isn't this a very clear case where the government absolutely failed in its duty to protect
[3:25:59.240 --> 3:26:03.800]  individual citizens and yet somehow we're supposed to trust them to always protect us at a moment's
[3:26:03.800 --> 3:26:10.680]  notice clearly they they cannot do that could we just enforce the laws that are already on the books
[3:26:11.480 --> 3:26:19.000]  crews had there'd been 18 individual complaints regarding crews filed with the sheriff's office
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:26.280]  of those two of those two rose to the letter level in which one case he was taken into custody
[3:26:26.280 --> 3:26:32.200]  and remanded to the state who then medicated him on the other instance he had moved out of the
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:37.960]  jurisdiction uh you know he should have been in the ncis register he should never have been able
[3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:45.000]  to own a gun buy a gun and of course the red flag of him being medicated by the state all the signs
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:51.000]  were there this is an extraordinary failure look i live here i have experienced i pardon me i have
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:57.720]  seen the grief and the anguish of the people in our community 17 young people died needlessly
[3:26:57.720 --> 3:27:03.320]  because one guy would not do his duty roger your analysis is spot on and i really appreciate the
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:06.840]  fact that what you're pointing out is that all the laws are on the books if they had just been
[3:27:06.840 --> 3:27:11.240]  invoked and engaged properly if the process had worked then this individual would not have been
[3:27:11.240 --> 3:27:15.080]  able to acquire that firearm that he used in the shooting or he could have been stopped by law
[3:27:15.080 --> 3:27:20.200]  enforcement in a timely manner and the number of deaths would have been vastly reduced maybe only
[3:27:20.200 --> 3:27:26.360]  one or two and yet what we're being told now by the mainstream left is that we need more laws
[3:27:26.360 --> 3:27:30.440]  because somehow the laws that are out there i don't know they don't want to enforce them they want
[3:27:30.440 --> 3:27:35.080]  more laws why don't they just make a law that it's illegal to shoot people in schools oh wait
[3:27:35.080 --> 3:27:40.280]  that's already illegal but it seems insane that more laws could solve this if we're not enforcing
[3:27:40.280 --> 3:27:46.120]  the ones on the books well and here's where i hope this is different than las vegas there's
[3:27:46.120 --> 3:27:51.960]  extensive video of everything this governor has ordered a complete inquiry by the florida
[3:27:51.960 --> 3:27:57.400]  department of law enforcement i hope that there will be no cover up here unlike las vegas this
[3:27:57.400 --> 3:28:04.120]  should all be able to be synced to a timeline based on radio transmissions eyewitness accounts
[3:28:04.120 --> 3:28:11.640]  and of course the ever-present cameras so i want to see exactly what did happen and i want those
[3:28:11.640 --> 3:28:16.920]  who are responsible to be held responsible absolutely you and i completely agree on that

[3:33:20.440 --> 3:33:31.080]  roger stone welcome back you're on the alex jones show and this is your host roger stone
[3:33:31.880 --> 3:33:39.240]  all of you are aware of the incredible war of censorship being waged against info war
[3:33:39.240 --> 3:33:47.000]  even a even as we speak we had the last time i looked two strikes out of three that would
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:56.040]  remove info wars from the youtube listings based on completely bogus claims that we said
[3:33:56.040 --> 3:34:03.960]  here at info wars that nobody died in parkland no one who works here ever said anything of the kind
[3:34:03.960 --> 3:34:09.320]  in fact we didn't even say that some of the witnesses were crisis actors what we said
[3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:15.240]  where they were students who appeared to be coached in their talking points the same thing
[3:34:15.240 --> 3:34:23.240]  that uh tucker carlston said over at fox the entire uh events of parkland and the tragic
[3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:31.320]  murders at margaery stoneman douglas high school are being used not only as an excuse to confiscate
[3:34:31.320 --> 3:34:41.400]  guns but also as the cover for a shutdown of the voices of freedom we see it at facebook google
[3:34:41.400 --> 3:34:51.960]  yahoo amazon twitter and facebook the fact that the shadow banning is going on is obvious i posted
[3:34:51.960 --> 3:34:59.880]  a statement about this most recent uh attempt to smear be by the atlantic magazine uh in which
[3:34:59.880 --> 3:35:06.120]  they cut and pasted messages between myself and wiki leaks that i disclosed to the house
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:14.360]  intelligence committee months ago that by the way prove that there was no collusion uh and uh
[3:35:14.360 --> 3:35:22.920]  suddenly my statement that used to get thousands of retweets on facebook get a handful this is
[3:35:22.920 --> 3:35:32.440]  evidence of what is going on here yesterday on the war room we we interviewed uh jason thick
[3:35:32.440 --> 3:35:41.160]  who is an internet entrepreneur he flagged for us a freedom based page on facebook
[3:35:41.160 --> 3:35:49.800]  with 3.2 million followers a pro trump page that was just arbitrarily decapitated yesterday
[3:35:50.600 --> 3:35:58.760]  this is the plan of the tech left and it's all about the 2018 election and then the 2020 election
[3:35:58.760 --> 3:36:06.120]  they are well aware of the fact that in 2016 they lost control for the first time uh ever in
[3:36:06.120 --> 3:36:13.560]  american history the three major networks did not completely manage and dominate the political
[3:36:13.560 --> 3:36:19.640]  dialogue used to be if they said something didn't happen it didn't happen if they covered something
[3:36:19.640 --> 3:36:27.320]  with their spin that was the official narrative there were no alternative voices the technological
[3:36:27.320 --> 3:36:35.320]  advances of the internet gave rise to a vibrant robust alternative media of which info wars is
[3:36:35.320 --> 3:36:43.080]  the undisputed leader if you read my book available at the info wars store the making of the president
[3:36:43.080 --> 3:36:53.320]  2016 i detail in precise order the role of info wars particularly and of conservative social and
[3:36:53.320 --> 3:37:01.240]  alternative media in general in the rise of this president down from could never have been
[3:37:01.240 --> 3:37:08.840]  elected without this vibrant alternative media community including info wars but what has
[3:37:08.840 --> 3:37:14.840]  his white house done have you seen him here on info wars or being interviewed at the daily
[3:37:14.840 --> 3:37:21.640]  caller or newsmax or any of the conservative alternatives no they have pandered to the
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:31.160]  politicos to the mainstream media to abc and nbc it makes no sense because that's not what the
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:39.080]  president's supporters are watching or following so it it's time for the trump administration
[3:37:39.080 --> 3:37:45.080]  and the republicans in congress to wake up to the fact that we are being silenced in preparation
[3:37:45.080 --> 3:37:53.240]  for a defeat in 2018 the idea is to uh to strangle us first so that then they can take
[3:37:53.240 --> 3:38:00.920]  out donald trump the president may not believe that he himself will ever be censored well perhaps
[3:38:00.920 --> 3:38:06.520]  he's right although i wouldn't bet on it what they are doing is turning down our volume in fact in
[3:38:06.520 --> 3:38:14.120]  some cases they're trying to turn it off by by disenfranchising his supporters by removing us
[3:38:14.120 --> 3:38:20.200]  from the battlefield they're laying the groundwork for donald trump's defeat and the defeat of the
[3:38:20.200 --> 3:38:27.720]  republican party they would like to silence us in their efforts to confiscate our guns if we're
[3:38:27.720 --> 3:38:33.480]  not here to object it will make gun confiscation and the violation of the second amendment
[3:38:33.480 --> 3:38:44.200]  all that much easier here is a task that i urge anyone who is interested uh do the chairman of the
[3:38:44.200 --> 3:38:52.360]  telecommutions telecommunications subcommittee in the us house is congressman ryan castello
[3:38:52.360 --> 3:39:04.280]  let us grab his phone number he's at castello.house.gov that's castello.house.gov email him right now
[3:39:04.280 --> 3:39:11.880]  and demand that our internet freedom be protected email him now and tell him that it's not fair
[3:39:11.880 --> 3:39:21.080]  it's not right for uh info wars to be barred over non-existent transgressions by youtube
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:27.880]  and that this is part and parcel of an effort to use the communications decency act the cda
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:35.480]  specifically section 230 which was actually originally written to control pornography on
[3:39:35.480 --> 3:39:43.880]  the internet but is now being used illegitimately uh to silence conservative alternative voices
[3:39:43.880 --> 3:39:53.080]  let's see if we can pull up the congressman's phone number there but you can go to 202-224-3121
[3:39:53.080 --> 3:40:00.040]  and ask for congressman ryan castello's office tell the congressman that this is urgent there you
[3:40:00.040 --> 3:40:10.520]  have his washington office on the left 202-225-4315 his pennsylvania office two of them uh whether you
[3:40:10.520 --> 3:40:17.480]  are in this district or not he is the ranking republican on these issues he is the one who
[3:40:17.480 --> 3:40:26.200]  must move quickly to amend the communications decency act so that is not used as a catchall
[3:40:26.200 --> 3:40:36.920]  to destroy conservative media now we're going to have to fight this out in the congress in the courts
[3:40:36.920 --> 3:40:43.880]  and in the in front of the administration as well as in the streets in terms of peaceful
[3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:51.800]  demonstration to make our point there are first amendment issues here there are monopoly and
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:41:00.200]  trust issue anti-trust issues there are service contract issues there are multiple legal issues
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:07.960]  you cannot be the town square as twitter claims if you bar people's access to the town square
[3:41:08.520 --> 3:41:14.520]  we're going to have to collect plaintiffs for an enormous class action lawsuit but that could take
[3:41:14.520 --> 3:41:21.640]  years to wind its way through the courts and candidly the effort to strangle us is going on
[3:41:21.640 --> 3:41:30.040]  right now president donald trump needs to direct his assistant attorney general for anti-trust
[3:41:30.040 --> 3:41:37.640]  matters to immediately investigate the abuses of google and to crack down on these monopolistic
[3:41:37.640 --> 3:41:44.280]  practices we want to see what key words they're using to censor conservatives is the word
[3:41:44.280 --> 3:41:53.160]  conservative the word info wars the word firearms do they trigger censorship i bet they do we have
[3:41:53.160 --> 3:42:00.360]  to demonstrate in the courts their manipulation of the system but before we do that we need to
[3:42:00.360 --> 3:42:07.640]  put maximum pressure on the congress the republicans and on the administration and we're candidly the
[3:42:07.640 --> 3:42:14.440]  president's son-in-law and daughter great people are out dining with google executives at the exact
[3:42:14.440 --> 3:42:21.800]  same time that google is seeking to strangle the trump reform movement i'm roger stone you're on

[3:46:59.080 --> 3:47:13.400]  alex jones show discover trends and global developments years before they happen right
[3:47:13.400 --> 3:47:24.600]  here on the alex jones show and now your host roger stone all right some talking heads there
[3:47:24.600 --> 3:47:31.560]  to bring us into the final segment you're at the tip of the spear this is freedom command
[3:47:31.560 --> 3:47:40.040]  central it's the alex jones show it never ceases to amaze me the way the mainstream media uh at
[3:47:40.040 --> 3:47:48.760]  the behest of their democratic handmaidens seek to reinflate the phony russian collusion narrative
[3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:57.240]  that has now been so thoroughly debunked uh and debased this week i received uh what in essence
[3:47:57.240 --> 3:48:04.920]  was a shift sandwich when jennifer rubin gave me a rubin in a column in the washington post
[3:48:04.920 --> 3:48:12.680]  that actually claimed that when the democratic counter russian collusion memo said that the
[3:48:12.680 --> 3:48:20.840]  russians had lagged email uh and documents to trump associates for review that that meant
[3:48:20.840 --> 3:48:31.240]  roger stone no it did not there is no evidence to that effect uh that is a falsehood a canard a
[3:48:31.240 --> 3:48:40.280]  phallic fairy tale a partisan lie yet jennifer rubin who is theoretically a legitimate mainstream
[3:48:40.280 --> 3:48:49.560]  media reporter for the washington compost says it as if it were a fact this is kafka ask it's
[3:48:49.560 --> 3:48:58.600]  it's a classic example of fake news uh yesterday i started to get a slew of calls from reporters
[3:48:58.600 --> 3:49:07.480]  who wanted to confirm that i had flown to london in 2016 to meet with julian asaj
[3:49:08.440 --> 3:49:18.200]  categorically absolutely totally false i have never met or spoken to asaj uh and in fact uh my
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:25.960]  passport which we showed earlier on the alex jones show demonstrates that i did not leave
[3:49:25.960 --> 3:49:33.640]  the country my secret messages were not secret at all they were completely and totally disclosed to
[3:49:33.640 --> 3:49:39.720]  the house intelligence committee there is my passport on the left you see a trip in 2010
[3:49:39.720 --> 3:49:46.520]  on the right you see at the trip that i took to bukarest to speak in 2017 there is nothing in
[3:49:46.520 --> 3:49:53.800]  between proof that i did not meet with asaj where do they come up with these hokey rumors
[3:49:53.800 --> 3:50:01.800]  it is entirely bogus but it's part and parcel of the kind of fake news that alex jones has been
[3:50:01.800 --> 3:50:09.720]  subjected to oh he said nobody was shot at parkland he never said anything of the kind
[3:50:10.520 --> 3:50:20.360]  this is being used solely pardon me as a as a as an excuse to strangle our first amendment rights
[3:50:20.360 --> 3:50:28.360]  first it is info wars but ultimately they will all go down the president must understand that
[3:50:28.360 --> 3:50:35.720]  he has a little prospect for legislative success little prospect to continue to hold control of
[3:50:35.720 --> 3:50:45.560]  congress a little prospect of reelection unless he has a free vibrant alternative uh uh media that
[3:50:45.560 --> 3:50:54.360]  uh uh media that thrives in an open internet this is why i spoke at the free our internet rally at
[3:50:54.360 --> 3:51:03.800]  cpaq just the other day i'm calling out google facebook yahoo uh uh uh twitter the internet
[3:51:03.800 --> 3:51:12.360]  giants uh they are running an absolute war of attrition they do not want to hear the truth
[3:51:12.360 --> 3:51:19.720]  about what we have to say they do not respect our first amendment constitutional rights uh
[3:51:19.720 --> 3:51:26.920]  and they are challenging us like never before alex jones has said this for the last several days
[3:51:26.920 --> 3:51:33.480]  they want to move to a weird society in which everything is operated by bots in which you
[3:51:33.480 --> 3:51:39.560]  are not communicating with anyone other than your small circle of friends and they charge you to do
[3:51:39.560 --> 3:51:50.280]  that it's the end of the reform movement this this ir uh program is uh dangerous but this is
[3:51:50.280 --> 3:51:57.000]  where we are headed and which is why again uh i tell you that to help us in the coming fight
[3:51:58.120 --> 3:52:05.880]  go to the info wars dot com store now uh we get uh punked and we get criticized for constantly

[3:55:08.760 --> 3:55:16.840]  pundit so many other great alternative publications is it matt drudge himself who has broken some of
[3:55:16.840 --> 3:55:25.240]  the biggest stories regarding the attempts to destabilize and delegitimize donald trump we are
[3:55:25.240 --> 3:55:34.680]  all at danger this is the struggle that faces us this is why i urge you again to contact congressman
[3:55:34.680 --> 3:55:43.080]  ryan costello he's the ranking republican on the house telecommunications subcommittee he is the
[3:55:43.080 --> 3:55:51.080]  man who can uh put forward amendments to the communications decency act that's being used
[3:55:51.080 --> 3:56:03.080]  right now even as we speak to strangle info wars you can reach him at 202 225 4315 this is uh uh
[3:56:03.080 --> 3:56:09.720]  the key individual now jason thick the internet entrepreneur who was with us yesterday on the
[3:56:09.720 --> 3:56:18.120]  war room had a meeting with congressman costello that was abruptly canceled this is disconcerting
[3:56:18.680 --> 3:56:26.280]  we cannot wait for a long drawn out court battle we have to move now and the administration and
[3:56:26.280 --> 3:56:34.440]  the republicans in congress must recognize that their fortunes are tied entirely to ours coming

[3:56:48.600 --> 3:56:56.360]  personal outrage at this attack on alex jones alex jones is not a racist he is not an anti-semite
[3:56:56.360 --> 3:57:02.920]  and he most definitely did not grab anybody's butt this is checkbook journalism where they
[3:57:02.920 --> 3:57:10.520]  pay people to lie they pay people to make to bear false witness they know alex jones is one of the
[3:57:10.520 --> 3:57:16.520]  most effective voices against the globalists they know alex jones is leading the fight
