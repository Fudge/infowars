[00:00.000 --> 00:24.160]  Well, John McCain is saying that Trump is supposedly a dictator.
[00:24.160 --> 00:28.500]  This is a guy that works with al-Qaeda and ISIS overseas, and John Bounds filed a report
[00:28.500 --> 00:33.880]  that completely destroys him, and then we're going to come back and just cover the fact
[00:33.880 --> 00:36.360]  that globalism is in total crisis.
[00:36.360 --> 00:37.360]  Stay with us.
[00:37.360 --> 00:41.600]  There's been a debate about when to take the president seriously.
[00:41.600 --> 00:46.160]  He recently tweeted that the press was the enemy of the American people.
[00:46.160 --> 00:47.840]  Should we take that seriously from him?
[00:47.840 --> 00:50.360]  Well, I think you should take it seriously.
[00:50.360 --> 00:55.160]  A fundamental part of that new world order was a free press.
[00:55.160 --> 01:00.920]  If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times
[01:00.920 --> 01:08.800]  adversarial press, and without it, I'm afraid that we would lose so much of our individual
[01:08.800 --> 01:10.200]  liberties over time.
[01:10.200 --> 01:12.360]  That's how dictators get started.
[01:12.360 --> 01:15.320]  We're talking establishment versus Trump.
[01:15.320 --> 01:17.680]  Trump considered to be an outsider.
[01:17.680 --> 01:20.240]  The establishment doesn't want any part of Trump.
[01:20.240 --> 01:24.960]  They don't want him to succeed, and I would throw some Republicans in that as well.
[01:24.960 --> 01:27.400]  It's just the way Washington works.
[01:27.400 --> 01:33.920]  Arizona Senator John McCain grew of the stool for the New World Order, traveled to Munich,
[01:33.920 --> 01:39.680]  Germany for the annual Munich Security Conference to plead with hordes of globalists hanging
[01:39.680 --> 01:45.520]  on to their neo-futilist dream, with McCain asking that his fellow American lapdogs not
[01:45.520 --> 01:49.080]  be counted out of the New World Order paradigm.
[01:49.080 --> 01:54.280]  Many of our peoples, including in my own country, are giving up on the West, that they see
[01:54.280 --> 01:59.440]  it as a bad deal that we may be better off without, and that while Western nations still
[01:59.440 --> 02:06.840]  have the power to maintain our world order, it's unclear whether we have the will.
[02:06.840 --> 02:12.360]  I know there is profound concern across Europe and the world that America is laying down
[02:12.360 --> 02:14.680]  the mantle of global leadership.
[02:14.680 --> 02:21.040]  I can only speak for myself, but I do not believe that that is the message you will hear from
[02:21.040 --> 02:25.840]  all of the American leaders who cared enough to travel here to Munich this weekend.
[02:25.840 --> 02:30.280]  That's not the message you heard today from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.
[02:30.280 --> 02:34.560]  That's not the message you will hear from Vice President Mike Pence.
[02:34.560 --> 02:39.680]  That's not the message you will hear from Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly,
[02:39.680 --> 02:46.320]  and that is certainly not the message you will hear tomorrow from our bipartisan congressional
[02:46.320 --> 02:47.920]  delegation.
[02:47.920 --> 02:50.040]  Make no mistake, my friends.
[02:50.040 --> 02:58.560]  These are dangerous times, but you should not count America out.
[02:58.560 --> 03:03.600]  Vice President Mike Pence had far more of a nationalist vision.
[03:03.600 --> 03:08.240]  We must be strong in our conviction that our cause is just, and that our way of life is
[03:08.240 --> 03:10.040]  worth defending.
[03:10.040 --> 03:15.040]  If we lose the will to do our part to defend ourselves, we jeopardize our shared heritage
[03:15.040 --> 03:17.040]  of freedom.
[03:17.040 --> 03:22.760]  Your President Trump's leadership, I can assure you, the United States will be strong, stronger
[03:22.760 --> 03:24.400]  than ever before.
[03:24.400 --> 03:27.800]  Waiting in the wings was German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
[03:27.800 --> 03:34.640]  Her popularity running on fumes as her own hubris couldn't hide the fact that as RT reports,
[03:34.640 --> 03:41.520]  almost 64 percent of Germans don't wish to see Angela Merkel reelected as Chancellor.
[03:41.520 --> 03:44.040]  A poll conducted by YouGov has found.
[03:44.040 --> 03:49.720]  Meanwhile, the Social Democrats are shooting ahead in the polls, despite predictions that
[03:49.720 --> 03:51.960]  their popularity was on the wane.
[03:51.960 --> 03:57.240]  The poll published on Monday shows that of the two-thirds of Germans dissatisfied with
[03:57.240 --> 04:04.040]  Merkel, 42 percent strongly want her out, while 22 percent said it was probably a good
[04:04.040 --> 04:06.040]  idea to elect a new leader.
[04:06.040 --> 04:11.600]  Conversely, 19 percent said it was probably best to stick with her to avoid a change in
[04:11.600 --> 04:17.280]  leadership in the foreseeable future, while only 8 percent strongly wanted to see her
[04:17.280 --> 04:18.760]  reelected as Chancellor.
[04:18.760 --> 04:24.400]  What we have today is a world where there is no fixed international global order, and
[04:24.400 --> 04:29.560]  in spite of the Cold War, the relationship with Russia, and by the end of the Cold War,
[04:29.560 --> 04:34.720]  the relationship with Russia is as yet, I say this from a European perspective, not as
[04:34.720 --> 04:35.920]  it should be.
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.720]  Munich served as a funeral for the New World Order, a memorial for the hell on Earth that
[04:40.720 --> 04:43.880]  nearly dominated the United States of America.
[04:43.880 --> 04:50.120]  Of course, globalism will rise yet again, but never forget, it is our duty as Americans
[04:50.120 --> 04:54.000]  to identify its malevolent presence at every opportunity.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.760]  John Bound for Infowars.com.
[04:56.760 --> 05:00.520]  Stay with us!
[05:00.520 --> 05:03.960]  Last week, Bill Gates, while speaking at the Munich Security Conference, made a dystopic
[05:03.960 --> 05:07.600]  bone-chilling statement when he said that the next epidemic could originate on a computer
[05:07.600 --> 05:12.240]  screen by a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create synthetic viruses and
[05:12.240 --> 05:16.720]  super contagions and deadly strains of the flu, he also said that this could kill tens
[05:16.720 --> 05:17.720]  of millions.
[05:17.720 --> 05:22.040]  A respiratory spread pathogen would kill more than 30 million people in less than a
[05:22.040 --> 05:27.680]  year, and there is a reasonable probability of that taking place in the years ahead.
[05:27.680 --> 05:30.120]  But he's also said this at TED Talks.
[05:30.120 --> 05:32.240]  How we can get this down to zero.
[05:32.240 --> 05:33.240]  First we've got population.
[05:33.240 --> 05:39.720]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services,
[05:39.720 --> 05:42.360]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[05:42.360 --> 05:46.880]  Lowering population by 10 to 15 percent still wouldn't yield Bill's desired result of zero,
[05:46.880 --> 05:49.320]  but it would reduce population by a billion people.
[05:49.320 --> 05:53.760]  So Gates speaks of population reduction and mass killings while his foundation is vaccinating
[05:53.760 --> 05:57.280]  large portions of Earth and sending out genetically modified mosquitoes.
[05:57.280 --> 05:59.040]  This is Owen Schroyer for Infowars.
[05:59.040 --> 06:00.040]  Sounds legit to me.
[06:00.040 --> 06:05.320]  Today, we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[06:05.320 --> 06:08.680]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[06:08.680 --> 06:13.880]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[06:13.880 --> 06:20.080]  bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[06:20.080 --> 06:21.760]  great tasting formula.
[06:21.760 --> 06:22.760]  Caveman.
[06:22.760 --> 06:26.440]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[06:26.440 --> 06:27.440]  superior ancestors.
[06:27.440 --> 06:29.920]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[06:29.920 --> 06:33.040]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[06:33.040 --> 06:38.240]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[06:38.240 --> 06:42.560]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[06:42.560 --> 06:46.200]  the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[06:46.200 --> 06:50.560]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[06:50.560 --> 06:54.200]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[06:54.200 --> 06:57.680]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[06:57.680 --> 06:59.880]  at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[06:59.880 --> 07:04.400]  You're investing in your health and supporting the Info War when you visit InfoWarsLife.com
[07:04.400 --> 07:08.920]  and purchase your supply of survival shield x2 nascent iodine and all the great products
[07:08.920 --> 07:10.320]  at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.520]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists,
[07:14.520 --> 07:20.400]  and the answer is clear, iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information
[07:20.400 --> 07:23.440]  coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[07:23.440 --> 07:29.240]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple
[07:29.240 --> 07:32.360]  blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine.
[07:32.360 --> 07:36.280]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[07:36.280 --> 07:39.200]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[07:39.200 --> 07:43.360]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[07:43.360 --> 07:47.760]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[07:47.760 --> 07:52.040]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[07:52.040 --> 07:59.040]  It is exclusive to InfoWarsLife.com and the InfoWarsLife family of incredible products.
[08:23.040 --> 08:30.040]  I've got a giant stack of economic numbers here, 98% of it is off the chart, positive news.
[08:30.040 --> 08:40.040]  But if you tune into the big pop culture media, you would think that Trump is wrecking this
[08:40.040 --> 08:46.040]  country and hurtling the world towards war.
[08:46.040 --> 08:47.040]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[08:47.040 --> 08:51.040]  Thank you so much for joining us on this President's Day transmission.
[08:51.040 --> 08:55.040]  Let me just do this because I want to just hit some of the headlines so you know what's
[08:55.040 --> 08:58.040]  in front of us first before I burrow into it.
[08:58.040 --> 09:03.040]  Obviously, Trump on Saturday said, we just saw what happened in Sweden.
[09:03.040 --> 09:05.040]  And then the media later laughed at him.
[09:05.040 --> 09:06.040]  They made fun of him.
[09:06.040 --> 09:09.040]  They said, oh, what did happen in Sweden?
[09:09.040 --> 09:13.040]  And the sweetest government came out and laughed at him and said, nothing's happened here.
[09:13.040 --> 09:19.040]  Just the highest crime rate in Europe now, the highest rate of rape.
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.040]  Even admitted government cover-up of it that's finally spilt out into the news as senior
[09:23.040 --> 09:28.040]  police officers, detectives, and even police chiefs, they're going to go public about the
[09:28.040 --> 09:35.040]  fact they've been ordered to cover up giant hordes of illegals and legals, raping, robbing,
[09:35.040 --> 09:39.040]  stealing, killing, you name it.
[09:39.040 --> 09:42.040]  And now even MSMs having to go, OK, Trump's right again.
[09:42.040 --> 09:43.040]  This is how they deceive.
[09:43.040 --> 09:50.040]  I have Merkel of Germany, I have the Pope of Rome, both saying, quote, there's no such
[09:50.040 --> 09:53.040]  thing as Islamic terror.
[09:53.040 --> 10:00.040]  So this is all part of the giant whitewash that MSM then jumps on board with and tries
[10:00.040 --> 10:02.040]  to brainwash the public that it doesn't exist.
[10:02.040 --> 10:07.040]  I saw a video last night that I meant to send to Nico, but it's like 15 minutes long.
[10:07.040 --> 10:13.040]  But it's a sink yogurt of the young turds.
[10:13.040 --> 10:17.040]  And he goes, while Trump got caught lying in his Thursday press conference, he said he
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.040]  doesn't really know anybody that has connections to Russia.
[10:20.040 --> 10:26.040]  But wait, he knows Roger Stone, an admitted Russian spy.
[10:26.040 --> 10:28.040]  So it was lies, within lies, within lies.
[10:28.040 --> 10:32.040]  I think the headline was something like, does Donald Trump, yeah, that was it.
[10:32.040 --> 10:35.040]  Does Donald Trump know Roger Stone?
[10:35.040 --> 10:37.040]  A silly question.
[10:37.040 --> 10:40.040]  So they start out going, Trump saying he doesn't know him, stone doesn't know him.
[10:40.040 --> 10:41.040]  That's pretty silly.
[10:41.040 --> 10:43.040]  Everybody knows they've been friends for 40 years.
[10:43.040 --> 10:44.040]  Total straw man.
[10:44.040 --> 10:46.040]  And they go, here's the press conference.
[10:46.040 --> 10:50.040]  Trump says he doesn't know anybody from Russia or that works for Russia.
[10:50.040 --> 10:51.040]  Now there it is.
[10:51.040 --> 10:52.040]  That picked up by newspapers.
[10:52.040 --> 10:56.040]  The young turds says Donald Trump know Roger Stone.
[10:56.040 --> 10:59.040]  And then you watch it.
[10:59.040 --> 11:02.040]  The video is called Trump lying about Roger Stone in Russia.
[11:02.040 --> 11:09.040]  And it cuts to a clip of the press conference last week where Trump says, I'm not in bed
[11:09.040 --> 11:10.040]  with Russia.
[11:10.040 --> 11:11.040]  I'm not doing business with them.
[11:11.040 --> 11:14.040]  I don't know anybody that's even with their government doing deals behind the scenes.
[11:14.040 --> 11:18.040]  Then they go, wait a minute, then you don't know Roger Stone because the New York Times
[11:18.040 --> 11:20.040]  said he's been connected to it.
[11:20.040 --> 11:23.040]  And Stone claims it's not true, but it is true.
[11:23.040 --> 11:26.040]  But then the New York Times never showed evidence.
[11:26.040 --> 11:28.040]  It's not true.
[11:28.040 --> 11:33.040]  That's the new levels of deceptions and fake news they're involved in.
[11:33.040 --> 11:38.040]  We got a call here at the office a few months ago that the whole new series of homeland,
[11:38.040 --> 11:46.040]  popular TV show, was going to be coming out and is based around me.
[11:46.040 --> 11:53.040]  And I'm this evil talk show host that puts out this information and causes disasters.
[11:53.040 --> 11:56.040]  So the whole push is, Ben Alex Jones, he's evil.
[11:56.040 --> 12:01.040]  Of course, the New York Times basically has the same thing in a big article today.
[12:01.040 --> 12:04.040]  And I went online just from the trailers for it.
[12:04.040 --> 12:11.040]  People believe I'm on the show and they believe that I am now working with Showtime to put out
[12:11.040 --> 12:12.040]  this information.
[12:12.040 --> 12:13.040]  In fact, let's play this.
[12:13.040 --> 12:14.040]  Let's back that up.
[12:14.040 --> 12:15.040]  Let's play this with audio in a moment.
[12:15.040 --> 12:18.040]  But this is what I'm dealing with now.
[12:18.040 --> 12:22.040]  Not just the ex files character in a studio that looks just like mine.
[12:22.040 --> 12:28.040]  And then Chris Carter admits the guy's based on me, but at least he's a good guy on the show somewhat.
[12:28.040 --> 12:29.040]  No.
[12:29.040 --> 12:38.040]  With this new homeland show and others, I'm out framing innocent Muslims and covering up
[12:38.040 --> 12:41.040]  basically terror attacks that other groups carry out.
[12:41.040 --> 12:46.040]  So now I'm covering up false flags on the new TV show.
[12:46.040 --> 12:51.040]  And the voice sounds enough like me in the trailers that people are asking Alex,
[12:51.040 --> 12:55.040]  why'd you sell out for a show attacking yourself?
[12:55.040 --> 12:57.040]  So you talk about fake news.
[12:57.040 --> 13:03.040]  This is a fake show that has a fake newscaster playing the part of me and then saying things
[13:03.040 --> 13:04.040]  I didn't say.
[13:04.040 --> 13:06.040]  It's fake upon fake upon fake.
[13:06.040 --> 13:13.040]  I sat there watching that young Turk video last night where it has the deceptive headline
[13:13.040 --> 13:18.040]  that Trump says he doesn't know stone.
[13:18.040 --> 13:19.040]  Well, let's see.
[13:19.040 --> 13:20.040]  He does know him.
[13:20.040 --> 13:21.040]  Let's see.
[13:21.040 --> 13:22.040]  Okay.
[13:22.040 --> 13:24.040]  Well, he's a known Russian agent.
[13:24.040 --> 13:28.040]  So Trump's lying about knowing Russian agents.
[13:28.040 --> 13:33.040]  And this is so verifiably easy to disprove.
[13:33.040 --> 13:34.040]  But they don't care.
[13:34.040 --> 13:39.040]  They sit there like con men that have been caught and they just double and quadruple
[13:39.040 --> 13:44.040]  and triple down and just don't care.
[13:44.040 --> 13:45.040]  Look at the lie.
[13:45.040 --> 13:48.040]  Is Trump lying about Roger Stone and Russia?
[13:48.040 --> 13:52.040]  First is Trump lying about knowing Roger Stone never says I don't know Roger Stone.
[13:52.040 --> 13:56.040]  It's not even a clip of him saying that at a press conference.
[13:56.040 --> 13:58.040]  The clip doesn't even correspond to what they say.
[13:58.040 --> 14:02.040]  It's like saying, I saw a bluebird in the nest.
[14:02.040 --> 14:04.040]  You look in the tree.
[14:04.040 --> 14:06.040]  There's not even a nest or there's not even a bird.
[14:06.040 --> 14:08.040]  There's not even a tree, folks.
[14:08.040 --> 14:10.040]  Look at that tree.
[14:10.040 --> 14:12.040]  You're like, that looks like a mouse for a computer.
[14:12.040 --> 14:13.040]  That's not a tree.
[14:13.040 --> 14:14.040]  Yeah, it is.
[14:14.040 --> 14:18.040]  And you're like, no, it's not, you're not even having a logical discussion.
[14:18.040 --> 14:20.040]  They just go, that doesn't matter.
[14:20.040 --> 14:22.040]  That doesn't matter.
[14:22.040 --> 14:26.040]  So this is a psychological warfare tactic.
[14:26.040 --> 14:31.040]  But I started getting calls, I guess it premiered last night on Showtime.
[14:31.040 --> 14:33.040]  And I guess it goes like Netflix later.
[14:33.040 --> 14:34.040]  This is the show Homeland.
[14:34.040 --> 14:36.040]  I know it's been a big show for years.
[14:36.040 --> 14:43.040]  And I'm sitting there and people are saying, you're on Homeland?
[14:43.040 --> 14:46.040]  Because I guess they start out the first episode where you don't see me.
[14:46.040 --> 14:47.040]  I haven't seen it yet.
[14:47.040 --> 14:48.040]  And it just sounds like my voice.
[14:48.040 --> 14:50.040]  But then it does even sound like my voice.
[14:50.040 --> 14:51.040]  It sounds like my voice.
[14:51.040 --> 14:53.040]  But then the guy isn't good at it.
[14:53.040 --> 14:55.040]  He kind of goes back into like an Australian accent.
[14:55.040 --> 14:58.040]  And then back into kind of what I sound like.
[14:58.040 --> 15:02.040]  And it's just like, I have to defend myself against this, that this isn't me.
[15:02.040 --> 15:06.040]  And then people go, oh, Alex, quit saying there's TV shows about you.
[15:06.040 --> 15:10.040]  The creators of it are in a whole bunch of newspapers.
[15:10.040 --> 15:15.040]  Variety and entertainment weekly.
[15:15.040 --> 15:19.040]  I mean, go look, Alex Jones, Google it in Homeland.
[15:19.040 --> 15:23.040]  And it's just like hundreds of articles at many.
[15:23.040 --> 15:27.040]  So then there's that whole thing where Garant Eagle of MSM say,
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.040]  Jones is crazy and claims there's TV shows about him.
[15:30.040 --> 15:33.040]  In fact, when Chris Carter came out and said the new X files is based on Alex Jones
[15:33.040 --> 15:36.040]  and his ideas and his theories and his worldview to a great extent.
[15:36.040 --> 15:39.040]  And there's a character that basically plays him.
[15:39.040 --> 15:40.040]  And I like Alex Jones.
[15:40.040 --> 15:43.040]  And I think Alex Jones is a libertarian, not a racist.
[15:43.040 --> 15:46.040]  Well, Chris Carter sounds like a closet Trump supporter to me.
[15:46.040 --> 15:48.040]  But I'm not going to say anything.
[15:48.040 --> 15:51.040]  They came out and said I was lying about that.
[15:51.040 --> 15:53.040]  The new X files wasn't about me.
[15:53.040 --> 15:55.040]  I mean, it's like I'm horrible.
[15:55.040 --> 15:56.040]  I'm dangerous.
[15:56.040 --> 15:58.040]  I'm reaching hundreds of millions of people every few months,
[15:58.040 --> 16:00.040]  but nobody listens and I'm a cook.
[16:00.040 --> 16:02.040]  Shut me up though.
[16:02.040 --> 16:04.040]  And Trump's lying saying he doesn't know Roger Stone.
[16:04.040 --> 16:08.040]  Then there's no such thing.
[16:08.040 --> 16:10.040]  And then I read the comments and I got depressed reading it.
[16:10.040 --> 16:12.040]  Because it's all like liberals are like, see,
[16:12.040 --> 16:16.040]  he has been caught as a Russian and caught not knowing him.
[16:16.040 --> 16:18.040]  They just make up these.
[16:18.040 --> 16:24.040]  It'd be like if I had them bring in Bob the kickboxing dummy.
[16:24.040 --> 16:26.040]  Like we've got one here in the office.
[16:26.040 --> 16:29.040]  And if I beat up Bob the kickboxing dummy and said,
[16:29.040 --> 16:31.040]  look, he didn't lay a hand on me.
[16:31.040 --> 16:32.040]  He didn't lay a glove on me.
[16:32.040 --> 16:34.040]  People say, dude, it's an inanimate object.
[16:34.040 --> 16:36.040]  It's a straw man.
[16:36.040 --> 16:40.040]  If I had a pinata of say Michael Moore and I beat it up,
[16:40.040 --> 16:42.040]  I didn't really beat up Michael Moore.
[16:42.040 --> 16:44.040]  They've now reached like two year old level.
[16:44.040 --> 16:45.040]  And I realized it.
[16:45.040 --> 16:49.040]  People are now wearing little safety pins on their collar.
[16:49.040 --> 16:50.040]  That means I could be triggered.
[16:50.040 --> 16:52.040]  I believe I'm in a safe space.
[16:52.040 --> 16:54.040]  Just basically don't even talk to me.
[16:54.040 --> 16:55.040]  I'm a basket case.
[16:55.040 --> 16:58.040]  And they're now everywhere coming into jobs and saying,
[16:58.040 --> 17:00.040]  you can't ever criticize me or I'll have,
[17:00.040 --> 17:01.040]  I have a disability.
[17:01.040 --> 17:05.040]  I'll have to sue you because I'm a snowflake.
[17:05.040 --> 17:09.040]  Total mental illness.
[17:09.040 --> 17:11.040]  And this is what they're pushing.
[17:11.040 --> 17:12.040]  This is what they're doing,
[17:12.040 --> 17:14.040]  but then they can come out and beat you up.
[17:14.040 --> 17:15.040]  If you're in a Trump rally,
[17:15.040 --> 17:18.040]  it's okay because they're allowed to,
[17:18.040 --> 17:20.040]  because they're triggered and they're better than you.
[17:20.040 --> 17:22.040]  And then the latest is they're allowing men
[17:22.040 --> 17:25.040]  at college campuses and high school campuses
[17:25.040 --> 17:29.040]  to take part in women's sports.
[17:29.040 --> 17:30.040]  And of course they're winning now.
[17:30.040 --> 17:33.040]  And they're allowing men to compete in the Olympics
[17:33.040 --> 17:37.040]  that have un-dropped basically,
[17:37.040 --> 17:40.040]  un-un-un-emerged, I think the exact scientific term,
[17:40.040 --> 17:44.040]  their testicles haven't dropped, but they've got testicles.
[17:44.040 --> 17:46.040]  So they're basically hemaphrodites.
[17:46.040 --> 17:47.040]  Well, it gets crazier.
[17:47.040 --> 17:48.040]  This is out of the Daily Mail.
[17:48.040 --> 17:50.040]  It's out of Texas.
[17:50.040 --> 17:54.040]  Transgender on steroids wins girls state wrestling tournament.
[17:54.040 --> 17:55.040]  Now get ready for this.
[17:55.040 --> 17:58.040]  It's a girl that identifies as a boy
[17:58.040 --> 18:01.040]  who is on anabolic steroids
[18:01.040 --> 18:03.040]  beating the girls in the wrestling.
[18:03.040 --> 18:04.040]  And the girls are saying,
[18:04.040 --> 18:06.040]  listen, we don't want to fight some girl
[18:06.040 --> 18:09.040]  who biologically with the hormones is a guy.
[18:09.040 --> 18:11.040]  She's disqualified and they're saying,
[18:11.040 --> 18:15.040]  shut up, you're anti-trans, whatever.
[18:15.040 --> 18:18.040]  No, our girls don't want to go up against a girl
[18:18.040 --> 18:20.040]  that's on anabolic steroids.
[18:20.040 --> 18:25.040]  So see, the laws of nature and the laws of reality
[18:25.040 --> 18:29.040]  and the laws of sports are being suspended for this
[18:29.040 --> 18:33.040]  on purpose to totally fry society.
[18:33.040 --> 18:36.040]  And then these people are proud of the fact
[18:36.040 --> 18:41.040]  that men are beating women in baseball teams and basketball
[18:41.040 --> 18:44.040]  and that women that are on male steroids, hormones,
[18:44.040 --> 18:46.040]  they're beating them now.
[18:46.040 --> 18:48.040]  I mean, it's again, they're in a special group
[18:48.040 --> 18:50.040]  so the laws are suspended for them.
[18:50.040 --> 18:51.040]  They're above the law.
[18:51.040 --> 18:52.040]  This is how you bring down civilization.
[18:52.040 --> 18:56.040]  I'm going to skip this break.
[18:56.040 --> 18:59.040]  So that's just a few of the articles I'm dealing with here
[18:59.040 --> 19:03.040]  and I'm watching them go from deception to pure deception
[19:03.040 --> 19:05.040]  and it doesn't just go to news.
[19:05.040 --> 19:06.040]  It goes to business.
[19:06.040 --> 19:07.040]  It goes to life.
[19:07.040 --> 19:11.040]  It goes to the UN saying it's above the law, diplomatic community.
[19:11.040 --> 19:12.040]  Big megabank saying that.
[19:12.040 --> 19:14.040]  Big megabank saying they've got one-sided trade deals
[19:14.040 --> 19:15.040]  and you have to live under it.
[19:15.040 --> 19:18.040]  And Trump's saying, no, all this uncommon stuff,
[19:18.040 --> 19:20.040]  all this uncommon sense stuff,
[19:20.040 --> 19:22.040]  all this upside down world stuff,
[19:22.040 --> 19:25.040]  all this one-sided trade deals, it's over.
[19:25.040 --> 19:27.040]  We're killing it.
[19:27.040 --> 19:29.040]  We're annihilating it.
[19:29.040 --> 19:30.040]  We're shutting it off.
[19:30.040 --> 19:31.040]  We're stopping it.
[19:31.040 --> 19:32.040]  And we're not going to have open borders
[19:32.040 --> 19:35.040]  to North Africa and the Middle East to let in all these people.
[19:35.040 --> 19:38.040]  We just saw what happened in Sweden.
[19:38.040 --> 19:40.040]  And they're like, nothing happened in Sweden.
[19:40.040 --> 19:42.040]  And the pope comes out and says, quote,
[19:42.040 --> 19:48.040]  yesterday there is no such thing as Islamic terror.
[19:48.040 --> 19:51.040]  And the Swedish government said, yeah, what's going on, Trump?
[19:51.040 --> 19:53.040]  And then he goes, you know the giant controversy taking place
[19:53.040 --> 19:54.040]  in your country, the record rapes.
[19:54.040 --> 19:57.040]  I've got the articles right here.
[19:57.040 --> 20:01.040]  But they're hoping that people are in such arrested development
[20:01.040 --> 20:04.040]  where in college, you don't just go to safe spaces.
[20:04.040 --> 20:07.040]  If you say you're upset, they put you in an area with coloring books,
[20:07.040 --> 20:15.040]  crayons, Play-Doh, and dolls and toys.
[20:15.040 --> 20:17.040]  And they're telling you, be arrested.
[20:17.040 --> 20:18.040]  Be a baby.
[20:18.040 --> 20:19.040]  Be a war to the state.
[20:19.040 --> 20:21.040]  Be mentally ill.
[20:21.040 --> 20:22.040]  Let us take care of you.
[20:22.040 --> 20:27.040]  This is an admitted plan.
[20:27.040 --> 20:28.040]  This is how they domesticate us.
[20:28.040 --> 20:29.040]  This is how they control us.
[20:29.040 --> 20:35.040]  This is how they dominate us.
[20:35.040 --> 20:38.040]  And then they come over and completely take over your society.
[20:38.040 --> 20:45.040]  So this is a scientific program of total control.
[20:45.040 --> 20:51.040]  And then meanwhile, Trump comes out and small business loans are increasing,
[20:51.040 --> 20:54.040]  small business spending is increasing,
[20:54.040 --> 20:59.040]  small business profits in just the last two months have exploded to the
[20:59.040 --> 21:04.040]  highest level seen since 1984 during the middle of the gigantic
[21:04.040 --> 21:07.040]  Reagan boom recovery.
[21:07.040 --> 21:09.040]  According to the federal government's own numbers,
[21:09.040 --> 21:12.040]  the best numbers ever, and some of these are from when he was
[21:12.040 --> 21:15.040]  just president-elect, CNN has to deceive.
[21:15.040 --> 21:17.040]  So they say there's one thing going right for Trump.
[21:17.040 --> 21:20.040]  No, his poll numbers are going straight up to and so much more.
[21:20.040 --> 21:27.040]  And it goes on to admit in the article that a slow economic data came out
[21:27.040 --> 21:29.040]  this week, almost all of it positive.
[21:29.040 --> 21:31.040]  Americans are still going to stores and spending big.
[21:31.040 --> 21:34.040]  Retail sales came in better than expected for January.
[21:34.040 --> 21:36.040]  They're also buying houses and cars and using their credit cards.
[21:36.040 --> 21:39.040]  On top of that, small business, medium-sized business owners are giddy.
[21:39.040 --> 21:44.040]  The NFIB Small Business Optimist Vimdex is at the highest level since 2004.
[21:44.040 --> 21:47.040]  Heck, even manufacturing made a pretty big turnaround.
[21:47.040 --> 21:50.040]  It looks almost healthy again.
[21:50.040 --> 21:53.040]  The Philly Fed Index, survey on how well manufacturing are doing,
[21:53.040 --> 21:55.040]  just hit its highest level since 1984.
[21:55.040 --> 21:58.040]  And anyone with money in the market likely noticed the U.S.
[21:58.040 --> 22:01.040]  stock market set even more records this week.
[22:01.040 --> 22:05.040]  In fact, American stocks are at the best they've been in 25 years.
[22:05.040 --> 22:07.040]  There's still a belief on Wall Street in many parts of Main Street
[22:07.040 --> 22:10.040]  that CNN has recently visited that Trump is going to get the economy
[22:10.040 --> 22:11.040]  surging again.
[22:11.040 --> 22:13.040]  Oh, there's still belief.
[22:13.040 --> 22:18.040]  He's desperately in a race to stop the globalist implosion plan.
[22:18.040 --> 22:20.040]  And they admit that's their plan.
[22:20.040 --> 22:25.040]  They're trying to tap down the economy, but having to admit that's not happening.
[22:25.040 --> 22:27.040]  Because they want to consolidate control.
[22:27.040 --> 22:28.040]  Here's another one.
[22:28.040 --> 22:32.040]  Americans are brimming with optimism on the economy, the Hill.
[22:32.040 --> 22:36.040]  But they go on to report that the American people are angry,
[22:36.040 --> 22:40.040]  saying they don't know why the media won't talk about it or won't promote it.
[22:40.040 --> 22:43.040]  Because for every one story where they admit the economy's doing really good
[22:43.040 --> 22:46.040]  compared to what it was, there's hundreds saying it's going to do horrible.
[22:46.040 --> 22:47.040]  It's over.
[22:47.040 --> 22:48.040]  It's going to implode.
[22:48.040 --> 22:50.040]  Get your money out.
[22:50.040 --> 22:54.040]  But we know that's fake news, don't we?
[22:54.040 --> 22:57.040]  Trump slashing financial regulations won't hurt you as much as you think.
[22:57.040 --> 22:59.040]  Market watch.
[22:59.040 --> 23:03.040]  They put Frank Dodd in not to fix the big money bubble that the Clintons
[23:03.040 --> 23:07.040]  created in the 90s.
[23:07.040 --> 23:13.040]  You know, if you look at what they actually did at every level of that,
[23:13.040 --> 23:16.040]  Frank Dodd put in regulations shutting down small banks,
[23:16.040 --> 23:21.040]  ability to loan, credit unions, and stopped the big bank bailout from going
[23:21.040 --> 23:25.040]  below the big mega banks and didn't even get to the local community banks.
[23:25.040 --> 23:27.040]  That's why Trump said Yellen needs to go.
[23:27.040 --> 23:30.040]  And it's about to bring in new Federal Reserve people that will actually do
[23:30.040 --> 23:35.040]  what he says and loan money to small businesses and lower interest rates.
[23:35.040 --> 23:37.040]  You can say, well, interest rates are almost zero.
[23:37.040 --> 23:38.040]  How can you lower them?
[23:38.040 --> 23:41.040]  It's zero for the big banks or close to it.
[23:41.040 --> 23:43.040]  And they want to go ahead and raise it because they were already giving themselves
[23:43.040 --> 23:45.040]  zero.
[23:45.040 --> 23:48.040]  But now they're going to lower it on credit cards or on small business loans
[23:48.040 --> 23:49.040]  and things.
[23:49.040 --> 23:53.040]  It's much lower and basically make them refinance with you if Trump gets his
[23:53.040 --> 23:57.040]  way so your debt isn't as big, which will then spur more spending.
[23:57.040 --> 23:59.040]  He's doing exactly what you do.
[23:59.040 --> 24:02.040]  Rand Paul came out this weekend and said, thank God we didn't get John McCain
[24:02.040 --> 24:05.040]  in saying Trump's a dictator.
[24:05.040 --> 24:08.040]  And thank God, you know, that we've got Trump because he's doing pretty darn good
[24:08.040 --> 24:12.040]  on the economy, just like his daddy said three weeks ago.
[24:12.040 --> 24:17.040]  He said Trump's doing a great job right here on this broadcast.
[24:17.040 --> 24:19.040]  Rand Paul said, we're lucky.
[24:19.040 --> 24:21.040]  We don't have John McCain.
[24:21.040 --> 24:23.040]  See, Rand's coming around.
[24:23.040 --> 24:27.040]  Sows Ron Paul because they see it and they know it and they know Trump's for real.
[24:27.040 --> 24:29.040]  They didn't believe it at first.
[24:29.040 --> 24:30.040]  I don't blame them.
[24:30.040 --> 24:31.040]  They're pretty hourly folks.
[24:31.040 --> 24:34.040]  They don't just jump on board stuff, but they now know.
[24:34.040 --> 24:36.040]  Let's go to it.
[24:36.040 --> 24:39.040]  What would you make of McCain's statement that we're creeping towards a situation
[24:39.040 --> 24:44.040]  where people are potentially supportive of dictatorship in this country?
[24:44.040 --> 24:48.040]  Is that over the top or is there a concern?
[24:48.040 --> 24:53.040]  I think Senator McCain's perspective is colored by his disagreements with President
[24:53.040 --> 24:55.040]  Trump on foreign policy.
[24:55.040 --> 24:58.040]  If I were to look at foreign policy, I would say John McCain's been wrong on
[24:58.040 --> 25:01.040]  just about everything over the last four decades.
[25:01.040 --> 25:05.040]  He advocated for the Iraq war, which I think destabilized the Middle East.
[25:05.040 --> 25:08.040]  If you look at the map, there's probably at least six different countries
[25:08.040 --> 25:12.040]  where John McCain is advocated for having U.S. boots on the ground.
[25:12.040 --> 25:15.040]  John McCain's complaint is we're either not at war somewhere
[25:15.040 --> 25:17.040]  or if we're at war, we leave too soon.
[25:17.040 --> 25:21.040]  We're not there soon enough and he wants us to stay forever wherever we send troops.
[25:21.040 --> 25:27.040]  So that's a foreign policy that is at odds with President Trump
[25:27.040 --> 25:31.040]  and also the idea of engagement, the idea of foreign policy realism
[25:31.040 --> 25:35.040]  I think fits more neatly with President Trump and with John McCain,
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.040]  the new conservative label of let's make the world safe for democracy
[25:39.040 --> 25:42.040]  and we're going to topple every regime hasn't worked.
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.040]  I mean, our intervention to destabilize the Assad regime
[25:45.040 --> 25:50.040]  has really made the chaos worse in Syria
[25:50.040 --> 25:52.040]  and if you were to get rid of Assad today,
[25:52.040 --> 25:56.040]  I would actually worry about the two million Christians that are protected by Assad.
[25:56.040 --> 25:59.040]  So I think it's more a foreign policy debate
[25:59.040 --> 26:02.040]  and Trump and McCain are on opposite sides of that debate
[26:02.040 --> 26:05.040]  and I tend to sympathize more with the President that we need to change.
[26:05.040 --> 26:10.040]  We don't need to continue to have a regime change throughout the world, nation building.
[26:10.040 --> 26:14.040]  It's expensive and we don't have enough money to rebuild our own country
[26:14.040 --> 26:16.040]  if we're rebuilding everyone else's countries.
[26:16.040 --> 26:19.040]  But just to clarify, what McCain said specifically is
[26:19.040 --> 26:22.040]  dictators get started by limiting freedom of the press.
[26:22.040 --> 26:25.040]  I imagine you agree with that.
[26:25.040 --> 26:28.040]  Well, the thing is, I don't agree with his analysis
[26:28.040 --> 26:30.040]  and applying that to the President.
[26:30.040 --> 26:34.040]  I haven't seen any legislation coming forward that wants to limit the press.
[26:34.040 --> 26:41.040]  I see President Trump expressing his opinion rather forceful in his own distinct way,
[26:41.040 --> 26:46.040]  but I see no evidence that anybody is putting forward any kind of legislation to limit the press.
[26:46.040 --> 26:51.040]  So I think people, you know, this is colored by John McCain's disagreement with President Trump.
[26:51.040 --> 26:56.040]  It all is. Everything that he says about the President is colored by his own personal dispute.
[26:56.040 --> 27:00.040]  He's got running with President Trump and it should be taken with a grain of salt
[27:00.040 --> 27:03.040]  because John McCain's the guy that's advocated for war everywhere.
[27:03.040 --> 27:09.040]  He would bankrupt the nation and actually we're very lucky John McCain's not in charge
[27:09.040 --> 27:12.040]  because I think we'd be in perpetual war.
[27:12.040 --> 27:15.040]  That's why I love Rand Paul. He's back.
[27:15.040 --> 27:19.040]  He's the guy that exposed Al Qaeda and then ISIS in Syria helped lead the charge.
[27:19.040 --> 27:22.040]  They got our military to tell Obama, no, he is amazing.
[27:22.040 --> 27:24.040]  I wish he was the Vice President quite frankly.
[27:24.040 --> 27:28.040]  And he's young enough that when Trump's gone, maybe he can be our next President.
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.040]  And I think Rand Paul is super smart, on target, a great guy.
[27:32.040 --> 27:37.040]  He somehow just moderated his message and it really hurt him with his constituents and listeners,
[27:37.040 --> 27:42.040]  but it's so good to see him absolutely hitting on all cylinders
[27:42.040 --> 27:46.040]  because there's this big hoax like everything else
[27:46.040 --> 27:50.040]  that Trump's trying to limit the press.
[27:50.040 --> 27:54.040]  There's no legislation, no one calling for it.
[27:54.040 --> 28:01.040]  Obama, two months ago, less than that, it was like two weeks until Trump got inaugurated,
[28:01.040 --> 28:09.040]  signed the NDAA for 2018, 2017, it overlaps, saying they were going to put the CIA
[28:09.040 --> 28:14.040]  over the board of governors of the FCC and start censoring, quote, fake news
[28:14.040 --> 28:20.040]  and they're all over the news calling for censoring me and shutting down fake news.
[28:20.040 --> 28:25.040]  I was talking to this New York Times writer this weekend who wrote a big story about this in the paper today.
[28:25.040 --> 28:27.040]  He was like, we don't call for censorship.
[28:27.040 --> 28:32.040]  I go, here's a bunch of your articles I'm looking at where you say Facebook's got a block fake news
[28:32.040 --> 28:36.040]  and I'm listed in here in articles you've written.
[28:36.040 --> 28:45.040]  And then I read other articles using like Rutenberg, Jim Rutenberg, where you are writing about
[28:45.040 --> 28:51.040]  and saying that Trump is trying to censor the press all because he's criticizing you.
[28:51.040 --> 28:57.040]  The left always says if they attacked you and you speak back, hey, my free speech.
[28:57.040 --> 29:00.040]  My speech doesn't end just because I offend you.
[29:00.040 --> 29:05.040]  Me disagreeing with you is coming back at you.
[29:05.040 --> 29:11.040]  Understand that? And Jim actually wrote a halfway accurate report for the New York Times.
[29:11.040 --> 29:13.040]  Roger Stone says one of the fairer people he knows.
[29:13.040 --> 29:15.040]  He did an overall good job getting some of the facts straight.
[29:15.040 --> 29:17.040]  But you read his other articles, which I read a bunch of them.
[29:17.040 --> 29:19.040]  I mean, it is just the same thing.
[29:19.040 --> 29:24.040]  We've got to censor fake news and my name is listed in there as an example of that.
[29:24.040 --> 29:30.040]  So they're the ones calling for censoring us and then they turn it around and say that Trump's trying to do it
[29:30.040 --> 29:35.040]  with absolutely zero evidence of it.
[29:35.040 --> 29:39.040]  It's this upside down world that's getting pushed and it's crazy.
[29:39.040 --> 29:44.040]  Meanwhile, the economy is exploding and they're doing everything they can to stall it.
[29:44.040 --> 30:00.040]  By the way, it's exploding for the little guys, the little guys, and in minority areas as well.
[30:00.040 --> 30:15.040]  Last week, Bill Gates, while speaking at the Munich Security Conference, made a dystopic bone-chilling statement when he said that the next epidemic could originate on a computer screen by a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create synthetic viruses and super contagions and deadly strains of the flu.
[30:15.040 --> 30:18.040]  He also said that this could kill tens of millions.
[30:18.040 --> 30:23.040]  The respiratory spread pathogen would kill more than 30 million people in less than a year.
[30:23.040 --> 30:28.040]  And there is a reasonable probability of that taking place in the years ahead.
[30:28.040 --> 30:30.040]  He's also said this at TED Talks.
[30:30.040 --> 30:32.040]  How we can get this down to zero.
[30:32.040 --> 30:34.040]  First, we've got population.
[30:34.040 --> 30:42.040]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15%.
[30:42.040 --> 30:49.040]  Lowering population by 10 to 15% still wouldn't yield Bill's desired result of zero, but it would reduce population by a billion people.
[30:49.040 --> 30:57.040]  So Gates speaks of population reduction and mass killings while his foundation is vaccinating large portions of Earth and sending out genetically modified mosquitoes.
[30:57.040 --> 31:00.040]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars. Sounds legit to me.

[33:22.040 --> 33:42.040]  Live from the infowarsteam.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:42.040 --> 33:46.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[33:46.040 --> 33:59.040]  We've got something kind of funny that's going to come up a little bit later in the next segment. We have a new social justice warrior, Megastar, that is actually in the building, who wants to pop in on the broadcast with me.
[33:59.040 --> 34:09.040]  So, I get ready to meet Trigley Snitch. That's the name, right?
[34:09.040 --> 34:26.040]  Oh, no, Rainbow Snitch. So, we're going to meet Rainbow Snitch coming up. But getting serious, they are weaponizing news and information and dumbing it down to a childlike level.
[34:26.040 --> 34:33.040]  Because this entire globalist program is about emotions and childlike level control.
[34:33.040 --> 34:39.040]  And so, when they come out and say, nothing's happened in Sweden, Trump's a big liar, they think you're stupid.
[34:39.040 --> 34:44.040]  There's a giant controversy in Sweden over all the different abusive things that have been happening there.
[34:44.040 --> 34:56.040]  We have new footage of feminist marches where the entire march stops and observes silence during the call to prayer and to Allah Akbar.
[34:56.040 --> 35:16.040]  What about that coming up? I witnessed it. I witnessed it personally. Now, this is in New York City, in DC. You cannot make this up.
[35:16.040 --> 35:40.040]  We should probably cut to the other one where we have the feminist going, Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar.
[35:40.040 --> 35:48.040]  And again, this is a fetish. This is a cuckolding. If they see this as really anti-Christian, anti-freedom, anti-West, anti-open society.
[35:48.040 --> 35:53.040]  And so, the groups leading these are Islamic. You can go look it up in Paul's article.
[35:53.040 --> 36:02.040]  They hand out these plastic hijabs that women then put on by the thousands and then they put it on the news saying, look how beautiful this is.
[36:02.040 --> 36:10.040]  And then Jalob says, how dare Trump want to keep people from coming into the United States. Yeah, we'll go to Somalia at Jalob.
[36:10.040 --> 36:19.040]  And don't worry, a bunch of Somalis are getting let in right now, unvetted.
[36:19.040 --> 36:23.040]  They don't let women do the call to prayer and under any Islamic system.
[36:23.040 --> 36:32.040]  So all of it is just completely upside down cuckoo land.
[36:32.040 --> 36:44.040]  And what other signs say, dismantle white supremacy. Everything is anti-white, anti-West, even though almost every one of them is white.
[36:44.040 --> 36:50.040]  This is mass mental illness. But this is what you pay for at the colleges. This is what goes on.
[36:50.040 --> 36:54.040]  And you see the type of women. And I'm not bashing women out to the like women. Give me a break.
[36:54.040 --> 36:58.040]  Please don't put me on your level of being obsessed with what sexuality somebody is.
[36:58.040 --> 37:06.040]  But these are the type of women that will come up to your good-looking wife, your girlfriend, whatever, in Austin and start hitting on them in front of you.
[37:06.040 --> 37:12.040]  And they can't even believe it. They're like, hey, back up. They're like, whoa, I'm politically correct. I'm royal.
[37:12.040 --> 37:18.040]  If a man wants to compete on a women's team, he can. If a woman wants to take steroids and compete on a women's team, she can.
[37:18.040 --> 37:22.040]  If a man wants to go in a women's bathroom, he can. Vice versa.
[37:22.040 --> 37:27.040]  And Nambla says, if they want to pick your five-year-old up out of the backyard, if your five-year-old says they want to go,
[37:27.040 --> 37:33.040]  because they're probably sitting at candy or a puppy or video games that you shouldn't be able to under law,
[37:33.040 --> 37:37.040]  they have it filed with the UN where they want international law to say they can come to your door.
[37:37.040 --> 37:42.040]  I'm here to pick up your five-year-old. And your five-year-old's been told by the school, whatever, it's going to be fun.
[37:42.040 --> 37:49.040]  He's taken them to Star Wars. You're like, no, Billy can't go. And they're like, your child's allowed to love. Get them to me.
[37:49.040 --> 37:53.040]  Your child's allowed to have an abortion. At age nine in California, the state takes them away.
[37:53.040 --> 38:00.040]  They're allowed to have inoculations without you saying, because they have their own freedom to go with a pedophile.
[38:00.040 --> 38:05.040]  And the pedophiles argue we won't have to take them to a slave dungeon. We might let them live.
[38:05.040 --> 38:11.040]  You see, if you just let us have sex with them, we won't have to kill them and throw them in a shallow grave.
[38:11.040 --> 38:17.040]  It's your fault we got to kill kids. We're liberal. You're not. Get used to it.
[38:17.040 --> 38:22.040]  Now, you just heard me break down what we're actually facing. It sounds unbelievable. It sounds unreal.
[38:22.040 --> 38:32.040]  It sounds like it couldn't be actually happening, but it is. This is who we're facing.
[38:32.040 --> 38:36.040]  You know, I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to, but I'm tempted just to play some more of Trump's Saturday speech.
[38:36.040 --> 38:43.040]  It was so incredibly powerful. In fact, I played the last two minutes at the start of the show yesterday where he said,
[38:43.040 --> 38:49.040]  one spirit, unity, our destiny together, going back to the beginnings of humanity, together into the future,
[38:49.040 --> 38:55.040]  this great human experience, everything you've heard here word for word, because it's a spirit.
[38:55.040 --> 39:03.040]  It's not that Trump's even getting it from me. And believe me, Trump knows that because we've had discussions about it.
[39:03.040 --> 39:13.040]  So you understand, it's infectious in a good way. And you dial into this, you really see the enemy for who they are.
[39:13.040 --> 39:18.040]  Because at times of great evil, great discernment is turned into the world by God.
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.040]  And if you just want to say, God, this looks like real evil. I don't know what to do. Please help me.
[39:22.040 --> 39:27.040]  God's going to give you the download of the understanding as much as you can handle.
[39:27.040 --> 39:33.040]  And if you can handle the first level, you're going to get more discernment and more discernment and more discernment and more discernment
[39:33.040 --> 39:40.040]  until pretty soon you're like, this is too much. And you're going to be where Trump is.
[39:40.040 --> 39:47.040]  Believe me, this is a very, very epic time to be alive and the enemy is fully aware of it.
[39:47.040 --> 39:58.040]  Trump talks about how he's changed. Well, because Trump has now been interfacing with the Liberty Movement, hard core,
[39:58.040 --> 40:06.040]  and he stared into our abyss in a good way and it changed him.
[40:06.040 --> 40:14.040]  Not that he was bad before, but now he is born again hard to take a quote from Full Metal Jacket.
[40:14.040 --> 40:17.040]  Here is the President Saturday.
[40:17.040 --> 40:23.040]  We have the chance now working together to deliver change for the ages.
[40:23.040 --> 40:36.040]  This will be change for the ages, change like never before, to pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity.
[40:36.040 --> 40:43.040]  We want to secure our borders and protect our workers, to rebuild our military and our infrastructure,
[40:43.040 --> 40:52.040]  to fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods, to bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities,
[40:52.040 --> 41:04.040]  to ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce, to reform our tax code and remove the regulations
[41:04.040 --> 41:16.040]  that undermine growth and innovation, and to replace chasms of distress with new bridges of opportunity and cooperation.
[41:16.040 --> 41:21.040]  We must ignore the tired echoes of yesterday's fights.
[41:21.040 --> 41:26.040]  We're fighting battles that no longer help us.
[41:26.040 --> 41:34.040]  We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight.
[41:34.040 --> 41:46.040]  I'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries.
[41:46.040 --> 41:53.040]  They're not paying their bills. They have to help us.
[41:53.040 --> 42:00.040]  No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past.
[42:00.040 --> 42:07.040]  No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about but failure.
[42:07.040 --> 42:11.040]  New circumstances demand new solutions.
[42:11.040 --> 42:16.040]  Americans have fought and won wars together.
[42:16.040 --> 42:22.040]  Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives.
[42:22.040 --> 42:33.040]  Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next,
[42:33.040 --> 42:39.040]  stretching back to the first day of our American independence.
[42:39.040 --> 42:49.040]  This is our legacy. It belongs to all of you, and it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.
[42:49.040 --> 42:59.040]  Now is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold action.
[42:59.040 --> 43:09.040]  Let us move past the differences of party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country.
[43:09.040 --> 43:23.040]  We are all brothers and all sisters. We share one home, one destiny, and one glorious American flag.
[43:23.040 --> 43:28.040]  We're united together by history and by providence.
[43:28.040 --> 43:33.040]  We will make America strong again, I promise.
[43:33.040 --> 43:38.040]  We will make America proud again.
[43:38.040 --> 43:43.040]  We will make America safe again.
[43:43.040 --> 43:51.040]  And we will make America great again, greater than ever before.
[43:51.040 --> 43:57.040]  May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.
[43:57.040 --> 44:04.040]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
[44:04.040 --> 44:08.040]  So there you go. Very, very, very powerful the way he ended that speech.
[44:08.040 --> 44:13.040]  And Trump's on the move. I mean, he's really doing the people's work.
[44:13.040 --> 44:21.040]  He's doing all the basic things you do, get loans to small businesses, get regulations off their back, move to cut the taxes, create optimism,
[44:21.040 --> 44:25.040]  bringing the people together, working to get jobs shipped back into the rust belt,
[44:25.040 --> 44:30.040]  trying to secure our borders, trying to deport hardened criminals.
[44:30.040 --> 44:36.040]  He's not just deporting families and people like they said, that's all lies.
[44:36.040 --> 44:41.040]  That they've been pushing from the beginning to distort everything and bring our civilization down.
[44:41.040 --> 44:50.040]  Now, briefly, before I go any further, we have a limited edition victory series, lower third for an M4,
[44:50.040 --> 44:54.040]  that you have to mill out yourself. Very easy to do. It's got all the instructions to it.
[44:54.040 --> 44:59.040]  That is one of a thousand. There's a thousand of these. We've already sold out of close to half of them.
[44:59.040 --> 45:07.040]  This is a commemorative edition. You don't even have to mill it. It's your personal lower from Tennessee Arms.
[45:07.040 --> 45:10.040]  It has the brass inserts, everything. And it's a piece of art.
[45:10.040 --> 45:17.040]  It's a collector item and absolutely boosts the value as a commemorative piece to yourself and your family as an heirloom.
[45:17.040 --> 45:25.040]  A lot of other laser-etched, original designs as well.
[45:25.040 --> 45:31.040]  So I want to thank you all for your support. Victory Series 1, President Donald J. Trump, Tennessee Arms, 80% lowers.
[45:31.040 --> 45:38.040]  It says 1776 reborn, 45th president of the United States, January 20th, 2017.
[45:38.040 --> 45:40.040]  That's when he announced the country reborn.
[45:40.040 --> 45:47.040]  I personally chose this image of President Donald J. Trump to launch the Victory Series Limited Edition Collector's 80% lowers.
[45:47.040 --> 45:59.040]  Normally, it would be priced at 160, but we've offering our loyal listeners an introductory price of 150. That's a very good deal for the receiver without the lower, without any of the artwork on it.
[45:59.040 --> 46:05.040]  We're about to sell out of limited editions and I said they are flying off the shelf. This is our run of only a thousand pieces.
[46:05.040 --> 46:11.040]  I assure you they will sell out quickly. Each lower is subsequently numbered. When they are gone, they are gone.
[46:11.040 --> 46:17.040]  They have already been tested and continue to function in excess of 30,000 to 60,000 rounds.
[46:17.040 --> 46:24.040]  This is the perfect example of a 360 win. Get super high quality Second Amendment products and support the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[46:24.040 --> 46:34.040]  Visit infoorstore.com today and get special introductory pricing on the Tennessee Arms 80% lowers.
[46:34.040 --> 46:44.040]  Also, we have caveman, the ultimate new paleo formulation on infowarslife.com.
[46:44.040 --> 46:50.040]  And it is bone broth, turmeric and so many other things concentrated, really high quality.
[46:50.040 --> 46:57.040]  So good for your body. So good for your connective tissue and your purchase to support the broadcast infowarslife.com.
[46:57.040 --> 47:04.040]  That's all three, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, but so many other great nutraceuticals and supplements are on the site.
[47:04.040 --> 47:08.040]  And that's how we fund this operation.
[47:08.040 --> 47:12.040]  Sure wish I'd have been paying attention to my phone a little while ago and it rang.
[47:12.040 --> 47:17.040]  I would have had to go to rebroadcast to take that call, but wouldn't the media let them know who was calling.
[47:17.040 --> 47:25.040]  And that's what's incredibly frustrating about this job is now they've got like a hotline, you know, in the White House with the president of the Russians.
[47:25.040 --> 47:29.040]  Certain people call your phone, phone becomes like a hotline.
[47:29.040 --> 47:32.040]  And then I don't usually pay attention to my phone.
[47:32.040 --> 47:37.040]  And then you miss really important phone calls and it really makes you mad.
[47:37.040 --> 47:43.040]  In fact, I missed the phone call twice while I'm sitting here on air, angry about other stuff behind the scenes around here.
[47:43.040 --> 47:45.040]  I just cannot let myself get angry.
[47:45.040 --> 47:51.040]  We have to realize how good we're doing, how far we've come, the different things that are happening in this society in this world.
[47:51.040 --> 47:58.040]  This is a really great time to be alive and very animating time to be alive.
[47:58.040 --> 48:07.040]  Another important piece that I wanted to hit on state officials to Trump revoke Obama's federal takeover of elections that happened right before Trump left.
[48:07.040 --> 48:09.040]  I mean, before Obama left and Trump came in.
[48:09.040 --> 48:11.040]  Remember, we told you that was coming.
[48:11.040 --> 48:17.040]  That's Clifford Cunningham upon info wars.com states oppose Obama's federal takeover of elections.
[48:17.040 --> 48:25.040]  Which needs to be reversed, but he's got so much more to reverse before he even gets to that because that was actually passed in the law.
[48:25.040 --> 48:34.040]  Continuing Obama's organizing for action partners with Soros linked indivisible to disrupt Trump's agenda.
[48:34.040 --> 48:39.040]  And Jase Sekelo and Fox News even talked about this is an admitted plan to overthrow the president.
[48:39.040 --> 48:44.040]  And they've got all their surrogates out there openly trying to have it happen when all Trump's trying to do.
[48:44.040 --> 48:47.040]  He's turned the economy on that even helps the globalists get richer.
[48:47.040 --> 48:49.040]  But see, they don't want that. They want to consolidate.
[48:49.040 --> 48:51.040]  They don't want anybody to have money with them.
[48:51.040 --> 48:55.040]  Jase Sekelo, Obama should be held accountable for the soft kill against Trump.
[48:55.040 --> 48:59.040]  And that is exactly what it is.
[48:59.040 --> 49:03.040]  So there is a lot going on, a lot unfolding.
[49:03.040 --> 49:06.040]  We're going to go to break here in just a few minutes.
[49:06.040 --> 49:10.040]  Just going to keep this phone right in front of me at all times.
[49:10.040 --> 49:11.040]  And that's another thing.
[49:11.040 --> 49:13.040]  This isn't about entertainment.
[49:13.040 --> 49:15.040]  This isn't about being a big talk show host at this point.
[49:15.040 --> 49:17.040]  This is about total war against the New World Order.
[49:17.040 --> 49:19.040]  I mean, I got a clip coming up.
[49:19.040 --> 49:24.040]  I was sure I did a report on it earlier today where Bill Gates came out and said,
[49:24.040 --> 49:29.040]  oh, we need to do these certain things or there's going to be a bio weapon that's going to kill millions and millions of people,
[49:29.040 --> 49:31.040]  maybe billions of people.
[49:31.040 --> 49:35.040]  But then if you know the backstory of Bill Gates and the whole Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[49:35.040 --> 49:41.040]  they want a world government in place to force medical controls and inoculations on people.
[49:41.040 --> 49:51.040]  And they believe global government will basically take place through this new planetary governing system through health care.
[49:51.040 --> 49:52.040]  And here's Chelsea's book.
[49:52.040 --> 49:54.040]  I've been using it as a thing to put coffee on so it's messy.
[49:54.040 --> 49:56.040]  But we can document him.
[49:56.040 --> 49:57.040]  Shot that.
[49:57.040 --> 50:00.040]  Governing global health.
[50:00.040 --> 50:06.040]  Chelsea Clinton, a new book, which they're not really promoting because it was supposed to be when Hillary won.
[50:06.040 --> 50:12.040]  Chelsea was supposed to head up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and bring in global government through health care.
[50:12.040 --> 50:17.040]  And they're now basically admitting all of this and basically holding the world hostage saying,
[50:17.040 --> 50:22.040]  you know, there's going to be these huge bio attacks that are coming and it's going to be worse than nuclear war.
[50:22.040 --> 50:26.040]  So in the old days, we said give us world government because of nuclear war,
[50:26.040 --> 50:28.040]  but nukes could kill the elites as well.
[50:28.040 --> 50:30.040]  There's not an inoculation for that.
[50:30.040 --> 50:34.040]  So now they're saying we want vaccines that will protect the elites, of course, not the public.
[50:34.040 --> 50:42.040]  They want us dirty vaccines so they can have a big cataclysm or a twilight of the gods into the world type.
[50:42.040 --> 50:46.040]  Armageddon scenario with bio weapons, but the elite could be protected.
[50:46.040 --> 50:49.040]  Kind of a moon raker scenario while that takes place.
[50:49.040 --> 50:51.040]  So they're basically saying give us global government.
[50:51.040 --> 50:53.040]  Oh, there's going to be a bio weapon release.
[50:53.040 --> 51:00.040]  But of course they're going to do the bio weapon release regardless.
[51:00.040 --> 51:05.040]  Hi, this is Ron Paul. I am a former congressman, physician and presidential candidate.
[51:05.040 --> 51:06.040]  The world is in turmoil.
[51:06.040 --> 51:11.040]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars and famines are commonplace.
[51:11.040 --> 51:14.040]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[51:14.040 --> 51:18.040]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[51:18.040 --> 51:22.040]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[51:22.040 --> 51:25.040]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[51:25.040 --> 51:29.040]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[51:29.040 --> 51:31.040]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[51:31.040 --> 51:35.040]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[51:35.040 --> 51:40.040]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat and it lasts up to 25 years.
[51:40.040 --> 51:42.040]  Who knows what the future will bring?
[51:42.040 --> 51:47.040]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.
[51:47.040 --> 51:54.040]  To learn more, go to harvestright.com or call 800-763-5999.

[53:48.040 --> 53:51.040]  Leave the city and seek refuge in the American Redoubt.
[54:18.040 --> 54:24.040]  Everybody wants to know him. They can see that he's just a fool.
[54:24.040 --> 54:27.040]  And he never gives an answer.
[54:27.040 --> 54:32.040]  Alright, coming up later in the broadcast, after Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us,
[54:32.040 --> 54:36.040]  and I should add the Motor City Madman, Ted Nugent's going to be joining us.
[54:36.040 --> 54:40.040]  He's getting ready to probably run for the Senate, is Rainbow Snitch.
[54:40.040 --> 54:42.040]  Rainbow Snitch.
[54:42.040 --> 54:45.040]  Get up, you white male. It's Rainbow Snitch.
[54:45.040 --> 54:48.040]  But she's the latest socialist where we should probably get you a chair in there
[54:48.040 --> 54:50.040]  because folks can't see your sign.
[54:50.040 --> 54:52.040]  Here, let me have it.
[54:52.040 --> 54:55.040]  Thank you very much, ma'am. I appreciate you joining us.
[54:55.040 --> 54:58.040]  You're racist, xenophobic.
[54:58.040 --> 55:01.040]  Okay, well, we finally got one of you to come on the show.
[55:01.040 --> 55:04.040]  You look a little bit like Millie Weaver, but we'll see what happens.
[55:04.040 --> 55:07.040]  Seriously, we're going to do an interview with you a little bit later.
[55:07.040 --> 55:09.040]  And how are you doing, young lady?
[55:09.040 --> 55:13.040]  Well, you know what? I just want to say that all you Trump supporters
[55:13.040 --> 55:17.040]  are a bunch of racist, xenophobic rednecks.
[55:17.040 --> 55:19.040]  I've never heard that before.
[55:19.040 --> 55:21.040]  Hmm, really?
[55:21.040 --> 55:26.040]  I noticed that you've got some underarm hair.
[55:26.040 --> 55:29.040]  You need to address me by my proper pronoun, okay?
[55:29.040 --> 55:32.040]  Because you can't call me he or she.
[55:32.040 --> 55:34.040]  I want to be called Z.
[55:34.040 --> 55:38.040]  So if you don't call me Z, then you're going to watch out and see what happens.
[55:38.040 --> 55:40.040]  Why don't we just call you something like sweetheart?
[55:40.040 --> 55:46.040]  Excuse me, but that is extremely racist and bigoted to call me sweetheart.
[55:46.040 --> 55:47.040]  How about cupcake?
[55:47.040 --> 55:53.040]  I identify as a multi-sexual, trans-dimensional, binary being.
[55:53.040 --> 55:57.040]  Do you agree with this Texas person where men are now on women's baseball teams
[55:57.040 --> 56:02.040]  and track teams are beating, but also women that identify as men
[56:02.040 --> 56:05.040]  are taking steroids and then competing on girls' teams,
[56:05.040 --> 56:08.040]  like in this Daily Mail article, transgender on steroids,
[56:08.040 --> 56:10.040]  wins girls' state wrestling tournament.
[56:10.040 --> 56:14.040]  Do you think maybe I should be able to win women's arm wrestling tournaments?
[56:14.040 --> 56:19.040]  I think that the whole system is completely rigged against women
[56:19.040 --> 56:25.040]  and that this is just an institution set up to try and oppress women, okay?
[56:25.040 --> 56:29.040]  And all you people out there that are just talking, you know, bad about Muslims,
[56:29.040 --> 56:32.040]  you guys are just bigoted people, you should, you know...
[56:32.040 --> 56:34.040]  Hey, let me show you that in New York,
[56:34.040 --> 56:38.040]  they're actually, the feminists groups are saying Allah Akbar doing prayer,
[56:38.040 --> 56:40.040]  prayer time in New York by the thousands.
[56:40.040 --> 56:43.040]  They're chanting Allah Akbar, but in real Islamic countries
[56:43.040 --> 56:46.040]  women can't even go out without hoods on their heads.
[56:46.040 --> 56:52.040]  Yeah, because people like you in America are completely racist
[56:52.040 --> 56:56.040]  and they are too afraid for themselves to come out in the streets
[56:56.040 --> 57:02.040]  and wear their hijabs and then all women in America should be able to wear hijab.
[57:02.040 --> 57:04.040]  But you're not answering my question.
[57:04.040 --> 57:06.040]  They cut women's genitals off in many Islamic countries.
[57:06.040 --> 57:08.040]  They sell them into slavery.
[57:08.040 --> 57:11.040]  They can pour acid on their face. They murder them if they talk back.
[57:11.040 --> 57:14.040]  They can't drive cars in like six different Islamic countries.
[57:14.040 --> 57:17.040]  They can't even go shopping.
[57:17.040 --> 57:19.040]  Well, I don't know.
[57:19.040 --> 57:22.040]  I mean, what do you mean?
[57:22.040 --> 57:25.040]  Women in America don't have any rights
[57:25.040 --> 57:29.040]  and women in other countries, I mean, they have more rights than in America.
[57:29.040 --> 57:32.040]  In America, women don't have any rights.
[57:32.040 --> 57:35.040]  Women don't have equal pay with men and, you know,
[57:35.040 --> 57:38.040]  men have all the good paying jobs and all the high paying positions.
[57:38.040 --> 57:42.040]  Women don't have equal rights and we demand equal rights.
[57:42.040 --> 57:47.040]  Why are modern feminists so into Islamic stuff and like wearing hijabs?
[57:47.040 --> 57:54.040]  Because, you know, Trump said that all Muslims are terrorists
[57:54.040 --> 57:59.040]  and, you know, that's why we need to support Muslims and let them come into the country
[57:59.040 --> 58:01.040]  and we don't need to vet anybody.
[58:01.040 --> 58:04.040]  Well, Trump never said that, but the Pope did say
[58:04.040 --> 58:07.040]  that there, quote, are no Muslim terrorists, period. It's impossible.
[58:07.040 --> 58:10.040]  Now, that's not true.
[58:10.040 --> 58:14.040]  Yeah, I don't know where you're getting these numbers from,
[58:14.040 --> 58:17.040]  but there are no Muslim terrorists.
[58:17.040 --> 58:22.040]  Okay, the only terrorists in this country are the white males.
[58:22.040 --> 58:26.040]  The white males are the terrorists in this country. Okay.
[58:26.040 --> 58:28.040]  Well, crime statistics don't show that.
[58:28.040 --> 58:31.040]  Well, you know, you know, people, anybody can...
[58:31.040 --> 58:35.040]  I'm going to ask you again, should a man be able to play on a women's football team?
[58:35.040 --> 58:37.040]  Um, no.
[58:37.040 --> 58:39.040]  Because women need to have...
[58:39.040 --> 58:41.040]  Hold on, we're going to be right back, we're going to be right back.
[58:41.040 --> 58:43.040]  One of the liberal thing that's happening,
[58:43.040 --> 58:45.040]  and that's why your name is Rainbow Snitch.
[58:45.040 --> 58:47.040]  Rainbow Snitch, because...
[58:47.040 --> 58:50.040]  Hold on, hold on, we'll hear about this name in a minute.

[59:47.040 --> 59:50.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:20.040]  She must be free again to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:23.040]  Hey, what do you think we call like America or ship a woman?
[1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:25.040]  Don't we hate women?
[1:00:25.040 --> 1:00:29.040]  Yeah, everybody hates women in America.
[1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:33.040]  I mean, that's the thing, like women don't have equal rights.
[1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:38.040]  We don't have equal rights ever since the beginning of the creation.
[1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:41.040]  Darling, darling, darling, darling, that's not true.
[1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:43.040]  Women have more rights than the West anywhere else.
[1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:48.040]  Excuse me, do not call me by, you know, the word darling.
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:51.040]  That is in itself extremely transphobic.
[1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:55.040]  You need to refer to me as my proper pronoun, which is Z.
[1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:02.040]  Okay, and if you don't, you're going to find out what happens.
[1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:04.040]  I noticed you guys get real threatening.
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:07.040]  Like, I noticed that at all of the events, women get beaten up.
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:10.040]  If they try to go hear Milo or other people speak, you think that's good?
[1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:15.040]  Yeah, because Milo is completely out of touch with reality.
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:18.040]  Milo is a racist, okay?
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:22.040]  Nobody likes Milo in this country and he needs to just stay away from the colleges
[1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:26.040]  because college people need to be able to have a safe space, okay?
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:33.040]  And if he's coming there invading our safe spaces on campus, then he needs to be removed, okay?
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:38.040]  You cannot have somebody like Milo coming out and preaching hate speech.
[1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:41.040]  So this woman deserves to be beat up by a bunch of men then?
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:44.040]  Yes, because she is standing for hate speech.
[1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:47.040]  She's going out of her way to make people...
[1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:50.040]  So what about the image of like 50 men beating a woman up
[1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:54.040]  and then her being dragged away like a horde of zombies got her into a crowd
[1:01:54.040 --> 1:01:58.040]  into the night to be put in the hospital with fractured collar bones?
[1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:00.040]  Well, America needs cleansing.
[1:02:00.040 --> 1:02:06.040]  America needs to go through cleansing because we can't continue to have all this hate speech, okay?
[1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:10.040]  But it seems to me that you're the ones that are really hateful and, you know, intolerant.
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:17.040]  You're racist, you're racist, you're racist, you're a bigot, you're a fascist, you're a fascist.
[1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:22.040]  And you have the chant, racist, go away, no, USA, KKK, how's it go?
[1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:30.040]  No Trump, no KKK, no racist, USA, no Trump, no KKK, no fascist, USA, no Trump.
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:40.040]  Yeah, seriously? Stop being racist and then you won't get beat over the head and have your Make America Great Again hat stolen from you.
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:41.040]  Okay?
[1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:45.040]  Well, the President Trump was the call-up on this telephone right here.
[1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:48.040]  What would you say to him?
[1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:54.040]  I would say that he knows that he stole the presidency from Hillary Clinton
[1:02:54.040 --> 1:03:03.040]  and that he is a Russian spy working for Vladimir Putin to continue the patriarchy in this nation
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:09.040]  and that he needs to do the right thing and leave before we force him to.
[1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:13.040]  Well, George Soros at Middle East working with Obama in a plan to overthrow Trump.
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:15.040]  What do you think of that?
[1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:25.040]  Well, good, because George Soros at least has a good sense and morals to make sure to remove the next Hitler.
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:28.040]  But if George Soros actually worked for Hitler?
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:32.040]  No, no, Trump is the embodiment of Hitler.
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:35.040]  But George Soros literally worked for Hitler?
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:38.040]  I don't believe you.
[1:03:38.040 --> 1:03:42.040]  La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.
[1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:44.040]  I don't believe you.
[1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:47.040]  Now, tell me about this outfit you're wearing for TV viewers.
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:50.040]  This is like the kind of outfit.
[1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:58.040]  I've got to say, normally you're a little too attractive compared to the average social justice lawyer.
[1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:03.040]  Yeah, because you are a bigoted white male.
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:06.040]  So you would say a chauvinist comment like that to me.
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:13.040]  I told you, don't even think of me or fur as me as a female because I am AZ.
[1:04:13.040 --> 1:04:15.040]  That's it. I'm a Z.
[1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:19.040]  Do you agree with the public schools that tell parents not to say mother or father on the entrance forms?
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:22.040]  Because if someone else has a mother or father, that might hurt somebody?
[1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:27.040]  Yeah, because it can be very hurtful for all the people out there that are non-binary.
[1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:32.040]  All of the children who their parents are both men and...
[1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:35.040]  You're going to be here at the studio for a few hours doing some interviews and things.
[1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:38.040]  When do we have a space for her to come back on?
[1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:44.040]  No, she didn't make you mad for me to say that.
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:48.040]  You are one sneaky, sneaky bigot.
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:50.040]  If you only knew how sneaky you were, leave me.
[1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:52.040]  You are so sneaky. Oh my gosh.
[1:04:52.040 --> 1:04:54.040]  I know what your problem is. I know what's wrong.
[1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:56.040]  I know what's wrong. I'm going to help you out, okay?
[1:04:56.040 --> 1:04:58.040]  You're the one. You better watch out.
[1:04:58.040 --> 1:05:00.040]  I know what you need, sweetheart. We'll be back.
[1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:03.040]  Last week, Bill Gates, while speaking at the Munich Security Conference,
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:07.040]  made a dystopic bone-chilling statement when he said that the next epidemic could originate
[1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:11.040]  on a computer screen by a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering
[1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:15.040]  to create synthetic viruses and super contagions and deadly strains of the flu.
[1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:18.040]  He also said that this could kill tens of millions.
[1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:23.040]  A respiratory spread pathogen would kill more than 30 million people in less than a year.
[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:28.040]  And there is a reasonable probability of that taking place in the years ahead.
[1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:30.040]  But he's also said this at TED Talks.
[1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:32.040]  How we can get this down to zero.
[1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:34.040]  First, we've got population.
[1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:39.040]  We do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services.
[1:05:39.040 --> 1:05:42.040]  We could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[1:05:42.040 --> 1:05:46.040]  Lowering population by 10 to 15 percent still wouldn't yield Bill's desired result of zero,
[1:05:46.040 --> 1:05:49.040]  but it would reduce population by a billion people.
[1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:52.040]  So Gates speaks of population reduction and mass killings
[1:05:52.040 --> 1:05:55.040]  while his foundation is vaccinating large portions of Earth
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:57.040]  and sending out genetically modified mosquitoes.
[1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:00.040]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars. Sounds legit to me.
[1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:04.040]  There was a mighty nation blessed above all of creation.
[1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:07.040]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:09.040]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[1:06:09.040 --> 1:06:13.040]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[1:06:13.040 --> 1:06:16.040]  Individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective.
[1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:18.040]  Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you?
[1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:20.040]  It's going to be coming after you're done.
[1:06:20.040 --> 1:06:21.040]  Oh, yeah.
[1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:23.040]  I take it ain't gonna sit well down my way at all.
[1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:24.040]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:26.040]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[1:06:26.040 --> 1:06:27.040]  They lost.
[1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:29.040]  We won.
[1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:31.040]  We never see what drums up against.
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:32.040]  It's time to ride, boys.
[1:06:32.040 --> 1:06:34.040]  We need a thousand pallet of ears.
[1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:37.040]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.
[1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:40.040]  Heritage, mom and apple pie.
[1:06:40.040 --> 1:06:42.040]  And beef was for supper.
[1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:45.040]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:47.040]  The ethical screenings on demand.

[1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:53.040]  Special ops general, Jerry Boykin.

[1:06:56.040 --> 1:06:58.040]  Revelation, the movie.
[1:06:58.040 --> 1:06:59.040]  Let's go.
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:28.040]  A Clean Toxic Free Body is the foundation of true health.
[1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:31.040]  There's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market
[1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:33.920]  that uses our proprietary spike,
[1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:36.040]  geric's herbal processing technique.

[1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:27.040]  From the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:59.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live getting Dr. Jerome C. R. Washington bureau chief on
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:05.040]  the line. We're about to go to him in just a moment and I gotta tell you, a lot is going
[1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:11.040]  on. There are definitely huge moves to isolate President Trump by the Republican Party inside
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:15.040]  of the White House, but that's not working. He broke out Saturday and gave that amazing
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:21.040]  speech in Melbourne, Florida. We heard a lot of excerpts of that earlier in the broadcast.
[1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:27.040]  Today and of course, Sunday. Coming up after Dr. Corsi leaves us, former UK prime minister
[1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:34.040]  Sir Edward Heath was a pedophile. That is the new claiming made by police in a major,
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:41.040]  long-term criminal investigation. I was told by a talk show host on air about this more
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:47.040]  than a decade ago and there was even more claims, not just that. Sir Edward Heath was a pedophile,
[1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:53.040]  says police chief. Astonishing claim is made that the former PM is guilty of vile crimes
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:57.040]  covered up by the establishment and he of course helped bring England into what became
[1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:02.040]  the European Union today. Mark Cuban says robots will cause unemployment and we need
[1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:06.040]  to prepare for it. Well, because the elites have made that decision. We shouldn't make
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:10.040]  that decision. We should say build a world for humans. Trump's ISIS plan, another US
[1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:17.040]  invasion. Ron Paul is being somewhat critical of that. Well, the US and the globalists and
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:22.040]  Soros help make the mess. They've come in and invaded. We have to crush the Saudi Arabian
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:29.040]  force. That's a just war to clean them out forever or they're going to continue. NASA
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:36.040]  sends antibiotic resistant bug into space. We're going to get what that project is involved
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:41.040]  in. Limbaugh rips deep state fake media in rare interview. We're going to be getting some
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:47.040]  of that as well. Shalman illa bug may help treat cancer. A lot of interesting things
[1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:52.040]  breaking on that front as Bill Gates comes out and says he believes that superb bugs are
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:56.040]  about to be released. We need a global government to counter them and Chelsea Clinton just magically
[1:10:56.040 --> 1:11:04.040]  has a book out right now saying the exact same thing. We have state officials in fact
[1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:11.040]  saying that Obama and the Democrats are going to run through to federalize elections. So
[1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:17.040]  we'll get into some of that report up on info wars.com. Obama organizing for action partners
[1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:24.040]  with Soros linked indivisible group to disrupt Trump's agenda. Jay Sekulow again as I mentioned
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:29.040]  said that Obama should be held accountable for the soft coup against Trump. But the bigger
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:35.040]  issue is what we're dealing with is the fifth columns that are inside the intelligence agencies.
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:41.040]  Big article courts he put out over the weekend at info wars.com dealing with the fact that
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:49.040]  not just Brennan but others were admitted sympathizers folks that had converted to radical
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:54.040]  Wahhabist Islam while living in Saudi Arabia that explains the fifth column. We have footage
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:12:01.040]  on info wars.com from New York where thousands of women at a feminist rally observed silence
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:06.040]  during the call to prayer and Allah Akbar and of course footage of women in Germany at
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:12.040]  feminist rally saying Allah Akbar and say they're going to convert to Islam. So first
[1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:16.040]  person I heard right about this would be like David Horowitz and then Dr. Corsi 15 years
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:20.040]  ago warning of the left's plan to merge with Islam. I just thought look I get the fact that
[1:12:20.040 --> 1:12:25.040]  the left's whacked out but merged with Islam when women are totally you know controlled
[1:12:25.040 --> 1:12:30.040]  under it it makes no sense but they're so cuckold they're so stockholmed under Stockholm
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:37.040]  syndrome that this is what they want. So it's just completely whacked out completely out
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:42.040]  of control but they're trying to stop Trump as the economic numbers pour in the small
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:47.040]  businesses very very exciting things are happening as Trump tries to jump start the economy.
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:51.040]  Because if he can defeat their plan to crush the economy they'll be derailed coming up in
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:56.040]  the next hour. The Motor City madman who's lived down here in Texas now not on blaming
[1:12:56.040 --> 1:13:00.040]  missions a great place but they become a little bit socialist. He might be moving back there
[1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:05.040]  to run for Senate. He still lives there part of the year and take that seat away from a
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:10.040]  Democrat show Ted Nugent coming up in the third hour today joining us again Washington
[1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:17.040]  Bureau Chief Dr. Jerome Corsi where to start here. Well we start almost anywhere Alex I
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:22.040]  mean I think the it's clearly now a war I mean I don't have any doubt that we're in a
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:29.040]  war and Info Wars is exactly the right title for it. You see a massive effort by the mainstream
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:35.040]  media right now to delegitimate Trump and you see a massive effort even within the White
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:42.040]  House to subvert Trump as well as in the bureaucracy and I've said for some time Trump
[1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:47.040]  is going to have to do a massive cleaning not only with the State Department the CIA
[1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:52.040]  but the entire intelligence apparatus going to have to clean out the White House anyone
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:58.040]  who's worked for Obama is suspect and I think that's the fundamental idea that's going to
[1:13:58.040 --> 1:14:02.040]  have to be conveyed and it's going to be a constant war with the mainstream media I don't
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:09.040]  see it stopping. We'll take this senior quote advisor who went to a private globalist meeting
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:14.040]  and badmouth the president and president learned about him and then demoted him back to his
[1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:18.040]  previous position what is wrong with these people White House confirms advisor resigning
[1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:24.040]  at disagreeing with Trump nobody did was backstab the president at a private closed door
[1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:30.040]  meeting with other people in the government a senior national security council advisors
[1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:35.040]  resigned his old job at the National Defense University White House spokesman confirmed Sunday
[1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:41.040]  after he criticized the Trump administration's Latin American policies Trump's administration
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:49.040]  Trump promises again hit Washington reality in the first month Craig Deere was removed
[1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:54.040]  from his role as a senior advisor to the National Security Council's Western Hemisphere Division
[1:14:54.040 --> 1:15:00.040]  Friday and sent back to his original position because he's unloyal not because he criticized
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:05.040]  he's in there in these meetings basically fomenting a strategy against the president
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:10.040]  and they think it's clever I mean this is the problem is that the mainstream media will
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:18.040]  applaud every one of these unfaithful dishonest officials within the Obama administration
[1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:25.040]  this lasted and kept on in the Trump administration and instead of being reassigned this this guy
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:31.040]  Deere should have been fired outright for insubordination I mean it's this is the undermining
[1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:37.040]  that's going on and it's going on constantly within the bureaucracy it's going on within the
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:44.040]  Republican Party in Congress and you combine that with an unstopping media attack a bombardment
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:50.040]  a daily bombardment on Trump and this is really where you've got to get control and White House
[1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:54.040]  is going to have to get control over the press room and it's going to have to get control
[1:15:54.040 --> 1:16:00.040]  over the the media and this fake news starts with the New York Times and the Washington Post
[1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:08.040]  starts with NBC I mean we've seen NBC constantly having to fire anchors over false news it's going
[1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:14.040]  on that consistent daily basis and it's a war to undermine the legitimacy of the Trump
[1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:20.040]  administration we've got to face it the left and the Obama leftovers the press really
[1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:25.040]  think they can destroy Trump and remove him from office some are so delusional think they
[1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:29.040]  could put Hillary Clinton into office they have no respect for the Constitution and it's
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:39.040]  out right war right now now dr. Corsi they have a new TV show out well it's been a TV show
[1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:43.040]  for a while but a new season of Homeland where they admit the characters based on me and
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:49.040]  then I say horrible things and cause disasters and need to be censored meanwhile they have
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:53.040]  mainstream news every day calling for myself and others to be shut down calling us fake
[1:16:53.040 --> 1:17:01.040]  news and then they have the nerve to go on national television on CNN I play the clip
[1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:06.040]  earlier and say that Trump's trying to censor the press and so he's a dictator of course
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:12.040]  John McCain saying that too so they've entered a new level of deception and the attacks are
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:17.040]  getting intensified I mean take a look at the New York Times hit piece that's out on that
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:24.040]  on Info Wars today a completely dishonest piece it you know mentions in the article in
[1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:30.040]  passing that Info Wars has never had as large an audience as we currently have more people
[1:17:30.040 --> 1:17:36.040]  today listening to Alex Jones and ever and this is what the mainstream media can't stand
[1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:43.040]  it can't stand the fact that you know Trump and the message of America is still alive
[1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:48.040]  and all the efforts of the globalist all the efforts of the New World Order the Bill Gates
[1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:52.040]  is the Soros is the whole bunch of them combined with all their money have not been able to
[1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:57.040]  shut up Info Wars and the next step if they could do it if Hillary had been elected would
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:03.040]  have been outright censorship you can bet on it well the New York Times also since
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:07.040]  there and says stuff like oh well some in the White House play down the connection
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:11.040]  between Jones and Trump which we've never even played up the point is Americana is
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:16.040]  coming back something we've all been promoting for a long time so they try to discredit me
[1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:24.040]  and then discredit Trump by extension it's just not working meanwhile Trump is absolutely
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:30.040]  again more and more isolated even though he's still able to get so much of his agenda through
[1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:36.040]  well I mean first of all you can kind of say that the left is losing the left is losing
[1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:42.040]  badly and if Obama has his way with this old FAA and they continue to disrupt town hall
[1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:46.040]  meetings all that's going to happen is that the left becomes marginalized so the Democratic
[1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:51.040]  Party is a European Democratic Socialist Party and the only ones are going to be talking
[1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:56.040]  to us themselves but if Obama thinks that he's going to be able to persist in Washington
[1:18:56.040 --> 1:19:02.040]  as a critic of the administration you better watch out because he didn't pardon himself
[1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:07.040]  he didn't pardon Hillary and Bill Clinton the Clinton Foundation is still operative
[1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:11.040]  there's a lot of information coming out I'm going to publish as soon as we get it written
[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:17.040]  up much more about Podesta and Hillary taking money from the Russians the ties are with
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:24.040]  Russia and have been money ties to Podesta and Hillary and what the Democrats are doing
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:28.040]  is trying to blame this on the Republicans it's not working you know the country is
[1:19:28.040 --> 1:19:35.040]  except for LA except for radical leftist socialists who are becoming increasingly street thugs
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:40.040]  the country is not paying attention and the Democrats are losing yet they'll persist on
[1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:45.040]  the agenda and they've got the attention of the mainstream media which I think basically
[1:19:45.040 --> 1:19:49.040]  is going to become marginalized as well I mean Trump is not going to lose this battle
[1:19:49.040 --> 1:19:53.040]  he has to immobilize his capital and start buying some of the mainstream media and shutting
[1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:58.040]  it down well it's unprecedented to see how they're dug in and aren't backing down calling
[1:19:58.040 --> 1:20:03.040]  for shutting us down attention patriots tired of the purity and crime in the sanctuary

[1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:13.040]  all right Dr. Jerome of course he's our guest I'm gonna open the phones up and play
[1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:16.040]  a bunch of clips and cover news in the next few segments and then of course the
[1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:20.040]  motor city madman Ted Nugent will be joining us talking about a Senate run
[1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:24.040]  next year very very exciting I was talking to Dr. Corsi during the break
[1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:28.040]  and I was just saying where do you think this is all coming from because seriously
[1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:34.040]  they're not having major network TV shows admit they have a character that's
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:38.040]  supposed to be me to discredit me by building straw men and saying and doing
[1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:43.040]  things that I don't support and then in the plots to the show homeland I'm saying
[1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:47.040]  that's that somebody did a bombing who didn't and I'm trying to frame people
[1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:52.040]  and I'm the villain and in fact since I mentioned it let's play that clip from
[1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:59.040]  homeland here's the trailer time with the globalist dragging us back taking us
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:04.040]  further and further away from the American dream which they are killing
[1:25:04.040 --> 1:25:09.040]  but that's why we're throwing up these links these videos streaming
[1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:16.040]  worldwide 24-7 because if you feel it this calling to be an independent
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:23.040]  American the time to rise up is now not a very good imitation but some people
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:28.040]  think that I'm really part of the show now Dr. Corsi I mean this again I mean
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:33.040]  they made some media thinks if they invent something and play it on a network
[1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:39.040]  or on HBO or whatever that it becomes reality I mean madam's secretary a whole
[1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:44.040]  show was an attempt to desensitize everyone to a woman being president
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:49.040]  they think they can affect the Americans by putting out these memes and these
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:53.040]  narratives the truth is you know the American people are smarter than that
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:57.040]  they see through it it's why they're turning off television they're not watching
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:00.040]  television not reading the New York Times the New York Times doesn't you know
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:04.040]  Washington Post doesn't it's all in its own building I mean these companies are
[1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:09.040]  bankrupt and they're going to be more bankrupt as people aren't listening to
[1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:13.040]  their lies and that's what's got to be exposed and when we're doing it every
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:18.040]  day the mainstream media hates it they want to demonize info wars and that's
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:23.040]  why they constantly are you know feeling trapped feeling like they're losing
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:26.040]  and they're becoming desperate
[1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:30.040]  what do you think they're going to pull next
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:34.040]  well I think if they could what they were going to do with Hillary Clinton is
[1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:38.040]  that they were going to basically run this fake news narrative and they were
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:43.040]  going to censor or take off shows like info wars they're going to ban it all
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:48.040]  together they were going to you know put mainstream media propaganda in like
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:53.040]  Pravda and the Soviet Union the left is intolerant they play games I mean this
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:57.040]  games they're playing with you know press credentials I mean I've applied for
[1:26:57.040 --> 1:27:02.040]  the press credentials but they say oh it's not on official Alex Jones info
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:07.040]  wars stationery and so the news agency's got to request them well but okay we'll
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:12.040]  follow their their rules we'll send in an info wars request and let's see what
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:16.040]  they do there's no legitimate reason why they can deny press credentials and when
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:20.040]  it comes to President Trump's attention you'll put an end to it but this is
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:24.040]  again part of the subversion from within the President Trump is not in
[1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:28.040]  control of the White House as long as there are Hillary Clinton and Barack
[1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:32.040]  Obama leftovers in positions of authority and you've got the White House
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:36.040]  Correspondents Association that continues to want to have the same people in the
[1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:41.040]  front row so every day they can bombard the president as press secretary with
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:46.040]  negative questions to lower the poll ratings and you'll see organizations
[1:27:46.040 --> 1:27:52.040]  come out increasingly and say oh the poll numbers are going down but again
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:56.040]  these are just as dishonest the polls that were in the election saying I was
[1:27:56.040 --> 1:27:59.040]  about to say I was about to say even even Gallup and others that you look at
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:03.040]  we have skewed methodology show him going up more than 10 points just the last
[1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:07.040]  few months so even with their skewed methodology he's rising real poll
[1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:11.040]  numbers are probably 65% the numbers are showing it the economy starting to
[1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:14.040]  kick back in I know you're really an expert on the economy that's what your
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:17.040]  degree in history's in there's a lot of bad indicators a lot of good indicators
[1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:20.040]  everything he's doing according to even Ron Paul and Rand Paul to their credit
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:25.040]  is wonderful for the economy but is it too little too late well no I think I
[1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:29.040]  think Donald Trump's on the right track and I think he's going to push through
[1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:34.040]  Congress a tax cut a massive tax cut I think he's going to push through the
[1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:38.040]  repeal of Obamacare it's going to be resisted you're going to have press
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:42.040]  saying oh the White House is in disarray you're going to have you know John
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:47.040]  McCain who's just a loser he couldn't be Barack Obama in 2008 you know total
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:53.040]  loser and hitting the president over you know this is what dictators do it's all
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:58.040]  nonsense the people here president Obama president Trump they hold heard him
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:03.040]  directly when he goes out and speaks in rallies the popularity's never been as
[1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:07.040]  high as it is today and if you believe the polls it's just like during the
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:12.040]  election campaign the polls showed that Trump was gonna lose big Hillary quick
[1:29:12.040 --> 1:29:17.040]  campaigning she was so confident polls are skewed the news is fake the media is
[1:29:17.040 --> 1:29:21.040]  contrived and it's a war because they want to win and they want to block out
[1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:26.040]  any effort to tell the truth thanks for popping in with us dr. Jerome Corsi
[1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:31.040]  with info or setting up our operations there in DC thank you so much for all
[1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:36.040]  the analysis we'll talk to you in soon and we eerily always await your articles
[1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:41.040]  analysis and columns and in full wars dot com the backup site prisonplanet.com
[1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:45.040]  are launching some new sites as well very very soon I'm gonna come back give the
[1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:49.040]  phone number out take your phone calls and cover a lot of news stay with us
[1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:56.040]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:30:00.040 --> 1:30:03.040]  last week Bill Gates while speaking at the Munich Security Conference made a
[1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:06.040]  dystopic bone-chilling statement when he said that the next epidemic could
[1:30:06.040 --> 1:30:10.040]  originate on a computer screen by a terrorist intent on using genetic
[1:30:10.040 --> 1:30:14.040]  engineering to create synthetic viruses and super contagions and deadly strains
[1:30:14.040 --> 1:30:18.040]  of the flu he also said that this could kill tens of millions a respiratory
[1:30:18.040 --> 1:30:23.040]  spread pathogen would kill more than 30 million people in less than a year and
[1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:27.040]  there is a reasonable probability of that taking place in the years ahead but
[1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:32.040]  he's also said this at TED Talks how we can get this down to zero first we've
[1:30:32.040 --> 1:30:38.040]  got population now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care
[1:30:38.040 --> 1:30:42.040]  reproductive health services we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent
[1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:45.040]  lowering population by 10 to 15 percent still wouldn't yield Bill's desired
[1:30:45.040 --> 1:30:49.040]  result of zero but it would reduce population by a billion people so Gates
[1:30:49.040 --> 1:30:53.040]  speaks of population reduction and mass killings while his foundation is
[1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:56.040]  vaccinating large portions of earth and sending out genetically modified
[1:30:56.040 --> 1:31:00.040]  mosquitoes this is Owen Shroyer for Info Wars sounds legit to me it's not just
[1:31:00.040 --> 1:31:04.040]  our water we need to filter it's not just our food that he's be clean it's the
[1:31:04.040 --> 1:31:08.040]  air we're breathing especially for our children the artificial particulates
[1:31:08.040 --> 1:31:13.040]  the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems the same team
[1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:17.040]  based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:22.040]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze whether it's

[1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:34.040]  at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:40.040]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves the general public doesn't the Alexa
[1:31:40.040 --> 1:31:43.040]  pure breeze would be a steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars
[1:31:43.040 --> 1:31:47.040]  one of these systems can keep eight hundred square feet incredibly clean this
[1:31:47.040 --> 1:31:50.040]  is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older
[1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:55.040]  more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is
[1:31:55.040 --> 1:32:00.040]  so revolutionary today info or store.com

[1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:16.040]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[1:33:16.040 --> 1:33:20.040]  here's a headline that says it all Trump supporters see a successful president
[1:33:20.040 --> 1:33:24.040]  and are frustrated with critics who don't that's how the Washington Post
[1:33:24.040 --> 1:33:28.040]  you mean like Mr. Bezos that owns your company they got 600 million dollar
[1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:33.040]  contract from the CIA last year for his clandestine operations inside the
[1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:39.040]  Amazon server farms these are all a bunch of taxpayer propped up oligarchs
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:44.040]  and this is the key the reason they're so arrogant is they don't care of MSM
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:47.040]  destroyed they don't care of the credibility of a bunch of narcissistic
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:51.040]  teleprompter readers those in the toilet even more they'll just launch new
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:57.040]  new networks later find new puppets new mercenaries new front people they
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:00.040]  haven't been identified they haven't been brought out in the light like
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:05.040]  Soros has to a certain extent but it's the Jeff Bezos is it's the bill of
[1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:10.040]  Melinda Gates is of the world it's the George Soros is it's the big owners
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:14.040]  of these companies that are the ones calling the shots and trying to get our
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:18.040]  guns and trying to bust our borders and trying to get rid of our wages and
[1:34:18.040 --> 1:34:22.040]  trying to make us poor and trying to get us into debt and getting big bailouts
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:26.040]  of our taxpayer money but they don't want you to get any low-interest loans
[1:34:26.040 --> 1:34:30.040]  they don't want you to get any factories because they want a monopoly
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:41.040]  they're a bunch of selfish jerks and all Trump's doing is 101 what'll turn this
[1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:45.040]  economy back on but that'll screw up their big fat juicy monopolies and
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:49.040]  they're angry about it and they don't like it so that's what's happening
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:53.040]  everything else is just window dressing I want to take some of your phone calls
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:56.040]  for first-time callers on what you thought of what Trump's done the last week
[1:34:56.040 --> 1:35:00.040]  these press conferences these tweets saying we're dealing with enemy media
[1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:04.040]  the amazing Marlago you know statements he's been making and what happened in
[1:35:04.040 --> 1:35:09.040]  Melbourne Florida the big speech am I wrong about Trump
[1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:14.040]  I mean I know I'm not the guy is on a prosperity mission and he's trying to
[1:35:14.040 --> 1:35:19.040]  unify us it it's a hundred percent now Trump's for real and all the small
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:23.040]  business numbers show it the manufacturing numbers show it even though
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:27.040]  it's an uphill fight the globalists are trying to stall the economy right now
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:31.040]  so where do we go from here and what are they going to pull out next and what
[1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:35.040]  are we going to do to hit the streets and really get aggressive politically to
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:39.040]  not be intimidated see we have to be aggressive and stand up and be in
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:43.040]  public and speak out and where make America great and info or shirts and
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:47.040]  things like that in public to show people that are scared that we're the
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:51.040]  majority and it's okay to stand up now and not be bullied by the globalist
[1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:55.040]  that's what Trump was doing he knows his numbers are up he knows the economy
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:35:59.040]  starting to come back but he knows you feel like you're alone you don't know
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:02.040]  that there are other people out there that feel like you when you go to a
[1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:07.040]  Trump rally you realize that so I would challenge the president but I was
[1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:10.040]  working really hard to get the economy going and national security and our
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:15.040]  borders to continue at least every two weeks and just bam bam bam do two or
[1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:21.040]  three events a day just every few weeks dedicated day
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:25.040]  to going out and resonating with the American people and I think you should
[1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:29.040]  go to California and let people see the globalist riot let them see people get
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:34.040]  attacked to show folks who we're dealing with just don't go to places he won't
[1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:41.040]  don't just go to Ohio or Michigan or Texas go to New York
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:49.040]  where we know he already goes but have a rally go to go to DC go to LA go to
[1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:54.040]  San Francisco go to Seattle because you've got your people there as well and
[1:36:54.040 --> 1:36:58.040]  you know it biggest crowds he got were in California because it's absolutely
[1:36:58.040 --> 1:37:04.040]  essential to call these bullies bluff they say he wants to censor the press
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:11.040]  they're the ones openly pushing it no bomb assigned orders to do it 800-259-9231
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:20.040]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:27.040]  now it's president's day
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:36.040]  I'm in a very bad mood right now okay I should be in a very very good mood I was
[1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:41.040]  in a really good mood yesterday I gotta tell you you can't let the bastards
[1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:46.040]  grind you down I just get so sick of everything I mean I really get sick of
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:50.040]  watching a bunch of feminists say Allah Akbar in New York City and put a jib
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:54.040]  on I want to throw up I mean if they wanted to be super orthodox and said
[1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:57.040]  women should be under men and not have their faces seen and actually said they
[1:37:57.040 --> 1:38:02.040]  were adopting Islam they're running around attacking the West saying we're
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:06.040]  evil and bad while they then say we should accept Islam even though it'll
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:12.040]  take everything away from them they claim they want it's just such a fraud
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:20.040]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:25.040]  meanwhile the US deploys an aircraft carrier can tend to South China Sea
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:29.040]  and China says you know even come through here we might attack you this is the most
[1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:34.040]  busy sea lanes in the world and now China if you look at the maps has just
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:40.040]  claimed basically 90% of it where no one can even navigate and go through it
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:47.040]  China's just declared they control the South China Sea in fact I texted you guys
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:53.040]  a link Sunday that I wanted to play and you got you grabbed another video off
[1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:58.040]  of it off that page there was another one that I really wanted to get where it
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:01.040]  what CNN really does good is they've got that thing where the ladies in a big
[1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:05.040]  huge studio walking around a green screen and she shows what China has now
[1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:09.040]  declared and it really puts under perspective in the South China Sea
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:14.040]  it's like 90% of it you can't even hardly go around it I mean it is just it is
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:20.040]  just insane and it's a video but see that's where they've got bases on those
[1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:25.040]  islands I mean if you punched it up on TV I guess I could do it like the lady I
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:28.040]  guess I could get a handheld mic and do it like maybe I'll just do that right now
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:30.040]  and then I can actually show people what I'm talking about all right do it over
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:34.040]  there on the on the on the map I can't show the CNN that actually have it
[1:39:34.040 --> 1:39:37.040]  here on my phone I will pull up on my phone right now we'll play it from this
[1:39:37.040 --> 1:39:48.040]  that's how we'll do it okay let me pull this up do to do find that for folks
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:52.040]  where I send that to listen that's a new code or send that to Matt I'm just
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:55.040]  getting kind of CD now about this stuff did y'all guys see the article I was
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:40:00.040]  talking about and then it's like a minute 33 video where they where they do the
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:04.040]  presentation right there there it is that's it and then they actually show on
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:08.040]  the Chinese maps what they're claiming we see that big red loot she shows right
[1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:12.040]  there in fact let's play a reporter we can't we start at the minute just get
[1:40:12.040 --> 1:40:16.040]  some audio and then I'll go to phone calls
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:26.040]  here's why that matters under the one China policy Beijing
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:32.040]  and we'll just take our time take our time take our time I love doing this
[1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:35.040]  live on air train wrecks are great the crews on a wonderful job was to take our
[1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:39.040]  time just enjoy ourselves because I've got no CD about stuff I want to play and
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:43.040]  so then I'll feel better if I can stand this one little thing like there's this
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:46.040]  one graphic in the back they've had for months that I can't get rid of and I
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:49.040]  just every time I do the show it's that blown out grabbing I could I decided if
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:54.040]  I could have that I could be free if I had that one thing but this again is
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:58.040]  just part of it all out trying to see and these may not look like much but these
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:02.040]  small sparsely populated islands and reefs are at the center of a heated
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:06.040]  international dispute over land and water rights involving China the United
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:10.040]  States and much of Southeast Asia nearly a third of the world's trade passes
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:14.040]  through here on ships and valuable gas and oil deposits are believed to lie
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:19.040]  below these waters Vietnam the Philippines Malaysia Brunei and Taiwan
[1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:24.040]  all have competing claims to territory but China is the most ambitious and the
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:29.040]  most aggressive as you can see China claims almost all of the sea siding in
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:33.040]  historic boundary it calls the nine dash line and over here in a chain of
[1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:37.040]  islands called the Spratlys China and to some extent Vietnam are rapidly
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:41.040]  building artificial islands installing infrastructure all to justify their
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:46.040]  territorial claims now let's zoom in all the way in on a reef here known as
[1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:50.040]  fiery cross satellite photos from the Asia Maritime Transparency Institute
[1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:54.040]  revealed just how much China has transformed this reef into a fully
[1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:58.040]  fledged island reclaiming over two million square meters adding lighthouses
[1:41:58.040 --> 1:42:03.040]  even an airstrip and just a few steps away zoom into a different story San
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:08.040]  K. Island controlled by Vietnam the AMTI says Vietnam expanded the island
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:13.040]  here by more than 50% adding defensive positions gun emplacements and trenches
[1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:18.040]  less than 12 kilometers from here Taiwan controls Taiping Island it's a little
[1:42:18.040 --> 1:42:22.040]  more than a runway with a medical clinic but it helps to justify Taiwan's claim
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:27.040]  to the region the dispute also spills out into the seas themselves anyone
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:31.040]  crossing these waters might run into Chinese military ships on drills US
[1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:35.040]  Navy boats conducting freedom of navigation operations or fishermen from
[1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:40.040]  Vietnam China or the Philippines a lot of traffic intention that has raised
[1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:44.040]  fears that this contested body of water could become a flashpoint between
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:49.040]  competing nations you know I want to build a studio like that I mean I'll
[1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:52.040]  give CNN credit where credit's due that they do that first rate if you're a TV
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:55.040]  viewer you saw it already unless you heard it and I wanted to show that
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:42:57.040]  actually I'm glad we showed it today because I've studied what's happening
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:03.040]  there and that was actually real news reporting by CNN and you're sitting
[1:43:03.040 --> 1:43:08.040]  there looking at China having 90% of it they never had that before you can't
[1:43:08.040 --> 1:43:13.040]  even get ships around where China claims it's international waters because
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:20.040]  it's so close to the coastline of other countries they call it unnavigable so
[1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:24.040]  they're basically seasoned control of one of the biggest sea lanes in the world
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:29.040]  if not the most busy and telling everybody just to sit down and shut up
[1:43:29.040 --> 1:43:37.040]  briefly we have a piece of art that also can be legally drilled out by you
[1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:42.040]  personally as a hobby project and use as a lower on M4 made by Tennessee Arms
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:51.040]  and this is a limited edition of the victory series 1776 reborn with an image
[1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:56.040]  of Donald Trump from a side view like a general and it's been lasered on there
[1:43:56.040 --> 1:44:00.040]  it's one of a thousand obviously the one you're seeing laser-etched there on
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:04.040]  screen and they ship these out to you within one day of your order it's
[1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:08.040]  drop-shipped and of course there's a few laws in a few states like California
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:10.040]  you've got to go ahead and put your own serial number on it there but just
[1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:14.040]  check your applicable laws we shouldn't follow those in your area we have an ATF
[1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:19.040]  letter this is totally legal and lawful because they don't consider it a firearm
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:24.040]  because it's only 80% drilled out if you're good you can do it in 10 minutes
[1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:28.040]  other folks like me probably take 15 20 minutes we have an informational video
[1:44:28.040 --> 1:44:31.040]  that we finally got produced and posted along with the directions that were
[1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:42.040]  already there to info wars store.com or call toll three triple eight two five three three one three nine triple eight two five three three one three nine

[1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:07.040]  all the way back to the dawn of humanity cooking meat over the fire and simmering down the bones into a broth
[1:45:07.040 --> 1:45:11.040]  today we call it bone broth for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:16.040]  before it became lost to our modern diets a processed junk introducing caveman

[1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:11.040]  okay I had a Ted Nugent joining us talk about liberty on the March imagine him as a US senator
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:17.040]  demographic show he's gonna win if we get behind him yes yes yes
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:23.040]  let's go to Jason in Deutschland Jason Merkel said yesterday there's no Islamic terror
[1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:30.040]  so did the Pope it does not exist is that true I can say conclusively that's absolutely not true
[1:46:30.040 --> 1:46:35.040]  but then why would why would they tell us something that's demonstrably not true
[1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:41.040]  well as you pointed out many times on your show the mainstream media over here is
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:50.040]  colluding with government forces and to suppress reports of all kinds of immigrant on native population crime
[1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:55.040]  and there have been anecdotal reports of course by police officers as well that they have been instructed
[1:46:55.040 --> 1:47:01.040]  to either not report or under report crime that has been brought to their attention by the local population
[1:47:01.040 --> 1:47:08.040]  absolutely now again I have a stack of news that admitting record crime in Germany record in Sweden huge national
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:13.040]  controversy is covering up rapes but according to our media they made fun of Trump talking about it
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:18.040]  and made jokes about rape isn't that cute but it's okay because they're liberals kind of like women screaming
[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:24.040]  Allah Akbar putting on the jibs in New York City or DC it's cute because they're liberals
[1:47:24.040 --> 1:47:32.040]  right well you know it's selective it's a selective reality that they choose to you know subscribe to rather
[1:47:32.040 --> 1:47:39.040]  than the objective reality that I think you know people that you know like myself who listen to you and others
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:44.040]  are trying to get closer to that objective reality
[1:47:44.040 --> 1:47:49.040]  well thank you for your support my friend what was your point about Trump's secret weapon
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:54.040]  yeah I might never have this opportunity again the opportunity is not lost on me that I'm actually speaking with you live on air
[1:47:54.040 --> 1:47:59.040]  could I have just 30 seconds to read a short message about a secret weapon that Trump can use right now to
[1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:03.040]  totally level his opposition for a fairly decent amount of time please
[1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:09.040]  okay Trump needs a secret weapon to stave off the wolves coming for him what could that secret weapon be
[1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:14.040]  what could be so disorienting and surprising that it could buy him immediate street cred with the average Americans
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:18.040]  and give him the extra wiggle room he needs right now to defeat the traders within the government who are trying to
[1:48:18.040 --> 1:48:24.040]  break him down I have the answer he must immediately federally decriminalize cannabis and give it to the states
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:29.040]  the president of the United States has the authority to do this the shockwave that would send throughout the establishment
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:33.040]  would be powerful enough to buy Trump some time to deal with the insurrection
[1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:37.040]  Colorado is a proof of concept of just how powerful decriminalizing cannabis can be for both the economy
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:43.040]  and the social consequences of drug use for example all alcohol related crimes among and use among young people have plummeted
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:50.040]  since cannabis legalization in Colorado if Trump wants to kill two birds with one stone setting the US economy free from its bondage
[1:48:50.040 --> 1:48:54.040]  and buying him some badly needed support among those inclined to believe the lies about his Russian connections
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:58.040]  this is the only and the best single attack he could muster right now
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:06.040]  he simply must free the greatest single greatest sociopolitically upsetting force in America that is cannabis legalization
[1:49:06.040 --> 1:49:13.040]  Trump must release what I call the Kraken reference to the early Russian Clash of the Titans movie
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:20.040]  I truly believe that if Trump wanted one single thing that he could do right now or in a very short amount of time
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:25.040]  that would completely throw everything into chaos on the opposing side this is it
[1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:30.040]  I totally agree now that's more than 30 seconds great points let me move on to get to the people
[1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:33.040]  but I appreciate your point Jason in Germany
[1:49:33.040 --> 1:49:38.040]  the number one thing you've got to do is get the economy going for small businesses and the average person
[1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:43.040]  that he's built in minority areas with good paying jobs to reverse this whole race war BS
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:45.040]  that they then turn into class war
[1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:53.040]  he's also got to claw back all the trillions in corporate income tax that people via the laws aren't allowed to even bring back
[1:49:53.040 --> 1:50:00.040]  but I agree socially to absolutely take away their narrative that he's this evil right winger
[1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:04.040]  most the public has smoked marijuana or does smoke it
[1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:08.040]  when you decriminalize it it actually shows that marijuana use goes down
[1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:12.040]  areas of Europe have done this same thing happen you can then tax it and control it
[1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:15.040]  I don't want to legalize I want to decriminalize
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:18.040]  then you can actually get it tested looked at and regulated
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:22.040]  because let me let's say not having regulation in drugs there's a lot of crap in it
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:27.040]  let's just be honest about that I'm not saying regulations are usually great but you know stuff like this it's serious
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:30.040]  and then it lets the states have the power to do what they want
[1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:35.040]  and fall through on the promise Obama said he would have of not going after the states he broke his promise and didn't
[1:50:35.040 --> 1:50:38.040]  and that would shatter the myth that he's this big right winger
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:41.040]  the problem is sessions is good on everything but the marijuana
[1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:45.040]  and a lot of folks you know from the south and other places that are older really think
[1:50:45.040 --> 1:50:47.040]  that's like some kind of commie thing
[1:50:47.040 --> 1:50:51.040]  so it's hard to get them to change their minds but it would be a giant victory
[1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:54.040]  if like Ron Paul Trump said put it back to the states
[1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:58.040]  and I think you can make a statement when a giant political victory with it
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:02.040]  this is the story of the shaving company called Harry's
[1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:05.040]  in an epic battle of David versus Goliath
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:07.040]  in the early 1980s a child was born
[1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:10.040]  two of them actually their names were Jeff and Andy
[1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:14.040]  time went by they developed facial hair and one day something happened
[1:51:14.040 --> 1:51:17.040]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors
[1:51:17.040 --> 1:51:21.040]  so they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all
[1:51:21.040 --> 1:51:25.040]  they hired the best designers they bought a 95 year old German blade factory
[1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:28.040]  and they started selling high quality razors online
[1:51:28.040 --> 1:51:30.040]  with no upcharging direct to customers
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:33.040]  how did the overpriced razor company respond?
[1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:35.040]  by threatening to sue their pants off
[1:51:35.040 --> 1:51:37.040]  don't worry Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants
[1:51:37.040 --> 1:51:41.040]  and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price

[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:31.040]  I'm not complaining
[1:54:31.040 --> 1:54:32.040]  if I sound distracted
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:33.040]  and it sounds like I mean to the crew sometimes
[1:54:33.040 --> 1:54:34.040]  I'm not
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:35.040]  they love me they're great
[1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:37.040]  I just believe me
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:38.040]  I'm weighing it over my head
[1:54:38.040 --> 1:54:39.040]  okay
[1:54:39.040 --> 1:54:40.040]  and so is everybody else
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:41.040]  okay
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:43.040]  anybody that tells you
[1:54:43.040 --> 1:54:45.040]  that this planet is in a major crisis
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:47.040]  and the crazy things aren't going on
[1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:48.040]  is lying to you
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:53.040]  there's just so much incredible stuff going on right now
[1:54:53.040 --> 1:54:54.040]  behind the scenes
[1:54:54.040 --> 1:54:56.040]  and that's all I can tell you
[1:54:56.040 --> 1:54:58.040]  but Trump is going through a lot right now
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:54:59.040]  to try to save this country
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:01.040]  and you notice the British are announced
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:03.040]  in their biggest newspapers
[1:55:03.040 --> 1:55:06.040]  that the prime minister was a pedophile
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:07.040]  well I had it
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:09.040]  that this prime minister
[1:55:09.040 --> 1:55:11.040]  wasn't just a pedophile
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:13.040]  but slit children's throats
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:14.040]  they would bring in white plastic paper
[1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:16.040]  bringing about a six year old girl
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:17.040]  straight razor
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:19.040]  they'd just slit the throat in front of him
[1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:20.040]  and then he would
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:22.040]  speak sexually aroused from that
[1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:23.040]  and the media
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:24.040]  go ahead and run with that
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:25.040]  I don't care
[1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:27.040]  the point is is that
[1:55:27.040 --> 1:55:28.040]  go ahead and attack me
[1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:30.040]  I mean when you've got stuff like that
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:32.040]  I was told on air
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:35.040]  15 years ago or more
[1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:38.040]  that one of the top British pedophiles
[1:55:38.040 --> 1:55:40.040]  they confirm was a top pedophile
[1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:41.040]  a procure
[1:55:41.040 --> 1:55:42.040]  Jimmy Savelle
[1:55:42.040 --> 1:55:44.040]  was indeed
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:46.040]  raping kids, killing kids
[1:55:46.040 --> 1:55:48.040]  and having sex with their dead bodies
[1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:50.040]  and I remember censoring guests that said that
[1:55:50.040 --> 1:55:52.040]  15 years ago
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:54.040]  and I remember censoring guests
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:55.040]  15 years ago
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:57.040]  that said this particular British prime minister
[1:55:57.040 --> 1:55:58.040]  was doing it
[1:55:58.040 --> 1:55:59.040]  so at this point
[1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:01.040]  I'm not censoring Jack Krap anymore
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:04.040]  because those people were right
[1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:06.040]  and one of them was David Ike
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:09.040]  what does that tell ya?
[1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:12.040]  and notice Trump's in all of a sudden
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:15.040]  and all this stuff's coming out
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:17.040]  because I was told by NYPD
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:19.040]  and by other federal sources watch
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:21.040]  Trump's going to start rolling up the pedophiles
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:23.040]  you're seeing it
[1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:26.040]  all over the world folks
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:27.040]  so there's a serious battle
[1:56:27.040 --> 1:56:31.040]  and at a certain point
[1:56:31.040 --> 1:56:33.040]  it makes me want to just
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:35.040]  I don't know how to explain it
[1:56:35.040 --> 1:56:36.040]  it's not run
[1:56:36.040 --> 1:56:39.040]  but I like
[1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:41.040]  sitting on air just calmly talking about this
[1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:42.040]  almost seems obscene now
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:43.040]  you know what I mean
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:45.040]  it's either like run away with my kids somewhere
[1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:46.040]  you know I don't mean literally
[1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:48.040]  but you know go hide out in the country
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:50.040]  or fight them physically
[1:56:50.040 --> 1:56:52.040]  or you know just sit here on air
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:54.040]  but see it's a war
[1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:55.040]  so you gotta be slick about it
[1:56:55.040 --> 1:56:56.040]  and we're winning the war
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:56:58.040]  and so I should be really positive
[1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:00.040]  so I apologize if I get negative
[1:57:00.040 --> 1:57:03.040]  it's just that if I could tell you everything I knew
[1:57:03.040 --> 1:57:07.040]  about what people in the no-no
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:08.040]  there's a war going on
[1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:09.040]  on this planet between good and evil
[1:57:09.040 --> 1:57:11.040]  I think that basically says it all
[1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:13.040]  doesn't it
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:14.040]  John and Texas
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:15.040]  Trump and Muslims
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:17.040]  go ahead you're on the air
[1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:18.040]  Hi Alex
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:19.040]  the left
[1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:21.040]  the left is using the Muslims
[1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:23.040]  as a foot soldiers
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:25.040]  in a new horrible Bolshevik army
[1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:27.040]  and what they're doing in Europe right now
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:28.040]  is basically a red tear
[1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:30.040]  that's right no they're bringing in their army
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:31.040]  and then they're going to use the terror
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:33.040]  of the Muslims to get even more power
[1:57:33.040 --> 1:57:35.040]  in Russia and that
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:37.040]  they could do the same things over again
[1:57:37.040 --> 1:57:39.040]  but it seems to me that's what the game plan is
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:40.040]  I agree
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:42.040]  what do you think of Trump?
[1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:45.040]  he's doing everything I want him to do
[1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:47.040]  the only criticism I have of him
[1:57:47.040 --> 1:57:49.040]  is if he
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:51.040]  concentrate more on getting his legislation passed
[1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:53.040]  and executive orders
[1:57:53.040 --> 1:57:55.040]  instead of you know all his backbite
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:57:57.040]  and trying to fight people that don't like him anyway
[1:57:57.040 --> 1:57:59.040]  let all of us let all our info wars
[1:57:59.040 --> 1:58:02.040]  and in the order that the media handle them
[1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:03.040]  the leftists
[1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:06.040]  and just concentrating on getting all this stuff passed
[1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:08.040]  because once he gets the economy to full employment
[1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:10.040]  and everything is rosy
[1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:12.040]  these people won't be able to get elected
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:14.040]  dog catcher
[1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:16.040]  well do you ever think in our lifetimes
[1:58:16.040 --> 1:58:18.040]  we'd see such a super champion?
[1:58:18.040 --> 1:58:20.040]  I never thought I'd see where
[1:58:20.040 --> 1:58:22.040]  were us
[1:58:22.040 --> 1:58:24.040]  the patriots and
[1:58:24.040 --> 1:58:26.040]  the Kylan people would have a foot in the door
[1:58:26.040 --> 1:58:28.040]  where he'd listen to us
[1:58:28.040 --> 1:58:30.040]  he'd listen to you and he'd listen to the other internet host
[1:58:30.040 --> 1:58:32.040]  that we got to say
[1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:34.040]  now he's the real deal
[1:58:34.040 --> 1:58:36.040]  he is the real deal
[1:58:36.040 --> 1:58:38.040]  Donald J. Trump is a real president
[1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:40.040]  for us in our corner
[1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:42.040]  he's Andrew Jackson reborn
[1:58:42.040 --> 1:58:44.040]  the mainstream media finally figured that out too
[1:58:44.040 --> 1:58:45.040]  we'll be back
[1:58:45.040 --> 1:59:07.040]  20 seconds more calls
[1:59:07.040 --> 1:59:16.040]  and 7 total primal superfoods
[1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:18.040]  that are our superior ancestors
[1:59:18.040 --> 1:59:20.040]  and we need to do everything we can to recapture that
[1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:23.040]  everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal
[1:59:23.040 --> 1:59:25.040]  you used the meat for sustenance
[1:59:25.040 --> 1:59:26.040]  the fat for cooking
[1:59:26.040 --> 1:59:28.040]  but you used the bones for strength
[1:59:28.040 --> 1:59:30.040]  for the outside structure
[1:59:30.040 --> 1:59:32.040]  full of minerals and Kiko factors
[1:59:32.040 --> 1:59:34.040]  for the marrow that produces the blood for the body
[1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:36.040]  this is the engine of the life essence
[1:59:36.040 --> 1:59:38.040]  I'm a long way from the caveman
[1:59:38.040 --> 1:59:39.040]  my ancestors were
[1:59:39.040 --> 1:59:41.040]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that
[1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:43.040]  essence that made us what we were
[1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:44.040]  and this is a big part of it
[1:59:44.040 --> 1:59:46.040]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman
[1:59:46.040 --> 1:59:48.040]  ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[1:59:48.040 --> 2:00:06.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation
[2:00:06.040 --> 2:00:32.040]  it's alex jones on the GCN radio network
[2:00:32.040 --> 2:00:34.040]  alright Blake in Florida you're on the air worldwide
[2:00:34.040 --> 2:00:36.040]  go ahead Blake thanks for joining us
[2:00:36.040 --> 2:00:38.040]  hey alex thanks for taking my call
[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:40.040]  thank you
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:42.040]  um first off I wanted to say I read
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:44.040]  the failing New York Times article
[2:00:44.040 --> 2:00:46.040]  on info wars today
[2:00:46.040 --> 2:00:48.040]  it's you know kind of the same as
[2:00:48.040 --> 2:00:50.040]  the rest of the mainstream media
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:52.040]  writes you know every day but
[2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:54.040]  I decided that if no one's listening
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:56.040]  it's because everyone's calling in to talk
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:00:58.040]  to alex jones because you're a tough guy
[2:00:58.040 --> 2:01:00.040]  to get a hold of
[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:02.040]  but I wanted to talk about
[2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:04.040]  secret service and Trump I saw
[2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:06.040]  a report on
[2:01:06.040 --> 2:01:08.040]  mainstream news I can't remember the exact
[2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:10.040]  network but they were saying
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:12.040]  it costs too much money to
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:14.040]  protect Trump maybe we can look
[2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:16.040]  into possibly cutting
[2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:18.040]  our costs and I was
[2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:20.040]  kind of wondering what you thought about that
[2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:22.040]  I was thinking possibly they're trying
[2:01:22.040 --> 2:01:24.040]  to thin out the herd and make it easier
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:26.040]  for one of these crazy people to take
[2:01:26.040 --> 2:01:28.040]  them out
[2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:30.040]  you've got mainstream media pushing for
[2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:32.040]  Trump's death everywhere so
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:34.040]  that's undoubtedly going on
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:36.040]  you've got them openly saying overthrow
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:38.040]  him in the media so
[2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:40.040]  that's what's happening most of the secret
[2:01:40.040 --> 2:01:42.040]  service are great people the problem is it's a
[2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:44.040]  government job so admittedly there's a lot
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:46.040]  of infiltrators some of them have openly
[2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:48.040]  said I won't protect you know Trump
[2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:50.040]  or I won't take a bullet for Trump so
[2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:52.040]  they're having to be you know basically sent to
[2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:54.040]  Siberia or you know sent to the North Pole to
[2:01:54.040 --> 2:01:56.040]  make that classic joke
[2:01:56.040 --> 2:01:58.040]  but I don't know all I know is
[2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:00.040]  they're turning the economy back on with
[2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:02.040]  every real move you do
[2:02:02.040 --> 2:02:04.040]  to help the little guy and not the big guys
[2:02:04.040 --> 2:02:06.040]  now the economy is going up
[2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:08.040]  so the big guys are going to get some profit
[2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:10.040]  as well and Trump's trying to
[2:02:10.040 --> 2:02:12.040]  say we're going to induce things
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:14.040]  where if you invest back in your workers
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:16.040]  you'll make even more money but if you
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:18.040]  don't invest in humanity we're going to
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:20.040]  basically push you out thank you Blake
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:22.040]  to hear from you who's up next
[2:02:22.040 --> 2:02:24.040]  here let's go ahead and talk to
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:26.040]  Victor
[2:02:26.040 --> 2:02:28.040]  Victor in Canada
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:30.040]  Victor you're on the air
[2:02:30.040 --> 2:02:32.040]  hi Alex
[2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:34.040]  hello Alex how are you
[2:02:34.040 --> 2:02:36.040]  good my friend
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:38.040]  a long time listener
[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:40.040]  from about 2006
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:42.040]  thank you
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:44.040]  I wish I would have been able to grab some of the
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:46.040]  fluoride that you came out with
[2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:48.040]  the best ingredient I've seen
[2:02:48.040 --> 2:02:50.040]  for any kind of fluoride period
[2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:52.040]  but I was late and it was all sold out
[2:02:52.040 --> 2:02:54.040]  but I want to talk about
[2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:56.040]  Donald Trump
[2:02:56.040 --> 2:02:58.040]  I call him Donald the Great
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:02.040]  I speak both languages I speak
[2:03:02.040 --> 2:03:04.040]  English and I speak Russian so I
[2:03:04.040 --> 2:03:06.040]  prescribe to the
[2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:08.040]  high policy makers
[2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:10.040]  in Russia so I've watched this thing
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:12.040]  for a long time I use
[2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:14.040]  as my bio on the YouTube I use
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:16.040]  First Amendment because it's the only
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:18.040]  thing that I think that's worthwhile living for
[2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:20.040]  and fighting for
[2:03:20.040 --> 2:03:22.040]  Donald Trump
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:24.040]  I think he's going to save
[2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:26.040]  humanity but what I see
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:28.040]  from top policy makers
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:30.040]  in Russia like Zhainovsky
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:34.040]  that is the bullet this Hillary Clinton
[2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:36.040]  of a real war
[2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:38.040]  that was 100%
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:40.040]  so I've watched
[2:03:40.040 --> 2:03:42.040]  Donald bringing jobs back
[2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:44.040]  and I've watched Donald
[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:46.040]  trying so hard
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:50.040]  to stand up for the American people
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:52.040]  a lot of them are fluoridated you can't
[2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:54.040]  really blame them too much
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:56.040]  No I agree they're so dumb down they're like
[2:03:56.040 --> 2:03:58.040]  zombies many of them very sad
[2:03:58.040 --> 2:04:00.040]  to say that but it's true they have no idea what's even happening
[2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:02.040]  that's what's crazy is you're watching Trump do
[2:04:02.040 --> 2:04:04.040]  everything he can and then half the public
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:06.040]  doesn't even appreciate it
[2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:08.040]  Yeah and I love him for that
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:10.040]  I believe that she's a crazy
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:12.040]  fighter he's like a clean piece
[2:04:12.040 --> 2:04:14.040]  of the western movie
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:16.040]  I've seen him take out
[2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:18.040]  the best of the best including
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:20.040]  the Pope including
[2:04:20.040 --> 2:04:22.040]  the Queen he killed
[2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:24.040]  all of them but not of course
[2:04:24.040 --> 2:04:26.040]  without our support that's how
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:28.040]  I knew American people
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:30.040]  really want to shake off those huge
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:32.040]  chains that they've been wearing
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:34.040]  for so long this is the previous
[2:04:34.040 --> 2:04:36.040]  degenerates that have been running it
[2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:40.040]  He's only on for about 20 minutes or so
[2:04:40.040 --> 2:04:42.040]  if you want to hold on I'll come back to you and finish up with you
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:44.040]  but thank you Victor we've got
[2:04:44.040 --> 2:04:46.040]  the Motor City Madman
[2:04:46.040 --> 2:04:48.040]  probably about to run them for Senate we're going to discuss it as soon as we get them on the line
