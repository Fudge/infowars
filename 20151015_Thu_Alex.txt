[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Assume, impeach him.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  Really?
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  Really?
[00:06.000 --> 00:12.000]  For what?
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  I mean, think about that.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  You're going to use taxpayer money
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  to sue me for doing my job.
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.000]  While you don't do your job.
[00:20.000 --> 00:23.000]  President Obama's questionable sanity
[00:23.000 --> 00:25.000]  is now not just being noticed by
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  mental health professionals.
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  His behavior seems irrational to me.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  It seems beyond that of
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  just a typical narcissistic,
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.000]  arrogant sort of,
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.000]  I'm a leader of a big country
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.000]  and I feel tyrannical at the moment,
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.000]  kind of attitude.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  Demonstrating behavior that is
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  not only anti-American,
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  but irrational and erratic
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  and perhaps not exactly
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  what we might want to deem same.
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.000]  Or political activist
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  and former presidential nominee
[00:53.000 --> 00:54.000]  Lyndon LaRouche.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  If you move this president, Obama,
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  out of office,
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  on the basis of his charge that he's insane,
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  that's under the 25th Amendment Section 4,
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.000]  he qualifies for expulsion from the presidency
[01:07.000 --> 01:09.000]  on the basis of that.
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  We're best-selling author and former
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  U.S. State Department official Steve Pacenek.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  Obama, the minute he talks about
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  his conspiracy theory or silliness
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  or whatever he wants to say,
[01:19.000 --> 01:21.000]  then what happens is it repercussions
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  back to him and it opens up
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  his own narcissistic vulnerability,
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  which is a fancy way of saying,
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  listen, the more you pump yourself up, stupid,
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  the more you're going to be vulnerable
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  to the American public asking questions
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  of what did you do in Chicago when you were growing up?
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  While you were married, before you were married,
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  before you were educated,
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  what kind of education did you really have?
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  Let's look at really what you did
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  because the more stupid things you say
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  and you do to the American public,
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  the more vulnerable you become
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  and go ask Axelrod, who's not the brightest guy in the world,
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  and ask your own heads of national intelligence
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  who remain there because they get pensions
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  and they get double pensions.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  These are not the same guys when the 90s and 80s
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  worked for Bush and Reagan
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  who really sacrificed their lives.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  These are guys who earned their pensions,
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  remained there, and really had never been
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  in the outside world.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  So I want this president to keep on attacking me
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  and you and the American public
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  to come out with more and more stupidity
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  underneath it all.
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  He's not just a liar. He knows he's a sociopath.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  He knows that from the day he was born,
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  he's a sociopath.
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  You don't get to be president of the United States
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  unless you want to manipulate that he's even lying.
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  But this is not a man who's basically all that bright
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  in the same way Condoleezza was not very bright.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  We know Bush Jr. was stupid.
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  Clinton was very bright,
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  but he's a bright liar.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  This man is not even a bright liar.
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  But now an entire country
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  has voiced its concern.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  John Schindler, a security expert
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  and whistleblower who now
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  writes for the Daily Beast,
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  has claimed that a senior EU official
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  from an undisclosed country
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  also inquired about the impeachment proceedings,
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  saying that
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  the nation believes Obama
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  is not fit for office.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  Schindler tweeted out the revelation Monday.
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  It read,
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  had a senior EU diplomat,
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  old friend ask me today,
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  how does your impeachment work?
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  The government believes Obama
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  is quite mentally unwell.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  In fact, the submissive,
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  domesticated Obama supporters at this point
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  have to be suffering
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  varying degrees of psychosis.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  You would have to be delusional
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  to ignore Obama's shrouded upbringing
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  by communist Muslims.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  His former identity is very so tarot
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  and Indonesian foreign exchange student
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  with confidential college records
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  that rose to prominence
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  traversing Marxist socialist circles
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  catapulted into the political landscape
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  due to funds provided by
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  shadowy foreign backers
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  and New World Order strategist
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  George Soros.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  President Obama has now shown
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  almost all of the cards in his hand
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  after decimating the US military
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  aiding and abetting the assault of the US Constitution,
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  increasing our national debt,
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  creating a mandatory
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  healthcare tax to destroy the middle class,
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  engaging in divide
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  and conquer leadership,
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  overseeing the policies and trade deals
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  that serve as a Trojan horse
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  for an emerging, corporatic,
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  global government.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  You would have to be mentally ill
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  to oppose prosperity.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  Humanity has an unlimited potential,
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  massively overshadowing the potential
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  of the New World Order beast's
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  technocratic eugenics plan.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  Our sovereign individual national
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  identities have to be maintained
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  and developed.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  It is only through this method of human innovation
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  that all of our greatest
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  and sanest achievements
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  have been obtained.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  John Bowne
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  John Bowne
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  deserves a Peabody
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  or something for the reporting he does.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  He is just absolutely amazing.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  I've got some news so devastating
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  that I can hardly even cover it
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  when we come back. Seriously.
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.000]  Indiana Sheriff Brad Rogers
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.000]  made his stance on the Second Amendment clear
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  during a recent interview.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  My mama today said
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  I'm creating an executive order
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  that all sheriffs and police chiefs
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  around this nation need to start
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  registering firearms. I will disregard it.
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.000]  Presidential candidate Jim Webb
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  defended the Second Amendment rights of Americans
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  during the first Democratic debate
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  and he actually called out his fellow politicians
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  on their hypocrisy.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  There are people at high levels
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  in this government who have bodyguards.
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  24 hours a day,
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  7 days a week.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  Every American does not have that
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  and deserves the right to be able to protect
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  their family.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  And Webb's point echoes recent comments
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  made by media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  I challenge Hillary,
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  take away your secret service, dismiss them.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  I dare you, Obama, same thing.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  Leave the White House unguarded, Obama.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth.

[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  you can help spread liberty worldwide
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  while also enjoying what I have found
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  to be the best tasting 100% organic
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  coffee on the planet.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  For more than a decade,
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  my favorite coffee has come from the
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  high mountains of southern Mexico
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  shade-grown Arabica beans.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  We have now managed to secure
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  Discover and try a bag
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  of the Patriot blend
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.000]  100% organic coffee
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  at infowarslife.com.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  This coffee gives you a long,
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  smooth pick-me-up for hours
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  without the headaches and heartburn
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  and it's taken us years to secure connections
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  Available in original
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  or with our immune support infusion blend.
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  You will be supporting a free press
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  all the while enjoying a truly
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[07:58.000 --> 08:24.000]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 15th
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  of October, 2015.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  and we have a very full broadcast today.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  But many times when I come in here
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  and go over the news that I'm going to be covering,
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  there is a dizzying feeling
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  because there's so much.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  Like what's important news
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  versus what's just sensational
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  and interesting.
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  I'm going to go through
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  what's important news versus what's just sensational
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  and interesting.
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  And sometimes things are really important
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  but they're also sensational.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  And I've talked a lot about this 15 years ago
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  I might have one over the top
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  insane story out of 100.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  Now I've probably got
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  75 out of 200 articles
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  that are just so over the top
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  I can't even believe it.
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  And then
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  every few months
[09:20.000 --> 09:22.000]  the past was every few years
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  but now it's over a few months
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  a group of stories come together
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  and with my knowledge
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  and understanding
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  of governmental systems worldwide
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  but particularly here in the United States
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  the tumblers basically click into place
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  the safe door opens
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  and you can really see what's inside.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  And a group of stories the last two weeks
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  come together in a confluence
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  that is so important
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  I am having trouble
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  feeling even worthy
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  to try to describe to you
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  how absolutely confirming
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  this is
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  and it shakes me
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  to my absolute
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  core.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  In fact this news is so important
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  that when I saw it this morning
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  before the show
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  and it connected into everything else
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  and it connected into everything else
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  we already know
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  I
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  almost went
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  to David Knight's office
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  and said please put on your sports jacket
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  grab all the news you're researching
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  you're doing the show
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  so that I could get
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  with Paul Watson or myself
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  in a word processor
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  and pull all these links together
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  put this together write an article
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  put out an emergency alert
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  and really make a big deal out of it
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  because if I just come up here
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  at the start of the show
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  and mention some of these stories
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  and
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  tell everybody it's really important
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  and tell everybody please get this information out
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  it won't go viral
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  if I
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  say we've got a big announcement in a couple days
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  and I build it up
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  which I don't do that folks
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  I always say coming up and I'll just tell you right then
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  what the news is because I just want to get it out
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  so what I am here trying to do
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  is make a big deal out of this
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  and really get people
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  who are lost in the haze of all the news
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  myself included I'm not on some
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  high mountain here
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  that we can really look
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  at the situation we're in
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  and really see that the worst
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  case scenario
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  analyses that we've come up with
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  and many others have now come up with
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  concurrent breakdowns basically
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  is so
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  horrible
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  and it confirms our worst
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  our worst
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  not fears our worst
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  long term projections
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  because we're not long term projecting now
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  we're in 2015
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  I am not
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  trying to be dramatic here
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  this is dramatic
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  Richard walked in this morning
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  and he said
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  you know you've been
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  covering
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  the safe cities initiative
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  and the UN treaty
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  we know it's tied to the TPP
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  on law enforcement
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  here's the headline
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  from a few weeks ago
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  Obama administration and UN
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  announced global police force
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  to fight extremism in US
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  now we have this new article out today
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  from UPI that no one
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  is covering
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  just department creates
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  domestic terrorism unit
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  and then we have their press releases
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  on it and we have an hour and a half
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  video
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  that we are watching and going over
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  with the Southern Poverty Law Center
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  and the ADL
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  basically running the justice department
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  creating their own basically
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  Bolshevik police force
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  and they say
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  and they link to
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  the previous Homeland Security reports
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  that we
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  received and leaked
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  years ago
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  five different ones
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  saying that the number one terror enemy
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  is patriots, veterans, gun owners,
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  conservatives, libertarians
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  and saying
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  that they are going to
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  federalize local police
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  and make their main mission
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  persecuting veterans
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  returning veterans, gun owners,
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  veterans
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  and you see the beginnings
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  of it
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  with 15 people charged in Georgia
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  for being at a park
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  with rebel
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  battle flags and American flags
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  and in the indictment
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  which is again at the state level
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  but the feds are involved
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  it says the flags
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  were threatening
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  and
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  and you add all this together
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  they are intending
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  to start a war
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  in the United States with the American people
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  they will
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  guaranteed stage false flags
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  to be blamed on us
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  and they will guaranteed
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  try to round up
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  the Americans in mass
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  they are moving to do it
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  I know in my gut and I can see all the facts
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  they intend to do it
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  there is no doubt now
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  they are insane
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  they are going for broke
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  they are crazy
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  Hitler was crazy going into Russia
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  Napoleon was crazy going into
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  areas and places
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  that he couldn't defeat
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  this is the nature of power
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  and we have megalomaniacs
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  running the show
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  that hate us the better cleaners
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  they hate us because we don't commit crime
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  at any rate that is measurable
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  they hate us because we produce so much wealth
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  they hate us because we are strong
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  they hate us because we are good
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  they hate us because they know
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  that we are not criminals like them
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  I told you that they were going
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  to start indicting Republican leadership
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  that was patriots
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  and they wanted to have Rand Paul's staffers
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  they are calling it payments for endorsements
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  no the campaign for liberty
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  other organizations that is what they do
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  is they give money to libertarian candidates
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  to build a movement
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  and the republican and democratic parties
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  have circled the wagons against
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  the tea party because the tea party
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  is taking over the republican party
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  we have removed the speaker
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  we are trying to get a good speaker in
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  that would be like getting a good president in
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  it is just as important
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  just as important
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  this is a quiet peaceful revolution
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  trying to take our country back the right way
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  and I am telling you right now
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  Ron Paul is on next week
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  but they are trying to find anything
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  to indict
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  Rand Paul
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  Ron Paul
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  Governor Abbott
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  they have already indicted the Texas Attorney General
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  I told you they got the feds on me
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  why do you think Drudge was here
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  Drudge has been told by Supreme Court Justice
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  and others that it is coming
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  they have been told
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  this is white knuckle time folks
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  and if they get away with indicting Rand Paul
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  I told you they are real
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  people want to bash them
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  fake libertarian whisper campaigns against them all day long
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  that is government run
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  because they know they got our phones tapped
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  they know our families
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  they know we are for real
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  they know we will go all the way
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  we are the real deal folks
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  and they know it
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  and they have got
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  the White House is ordering the FBI
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  to find something
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  they have been investigating me for two years
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  the FBI for all its problems
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  has a
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  organizational resistance to the total destruction
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  of the country
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  and I was told about a year ago
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  they were going to create a justice department
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  special unit
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  that will basically command local police forces
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  and will take control
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  of special units that they are creating
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  within the ATF
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  the BATF within the FBI
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  within the hostage rescue team
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  all of it
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  this is the equivalent of a hitlerian brown shirt
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  takeover
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  in America
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  and they are making their move with a coup
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  inside the government
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  to really take over
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  they have got the central banks
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  they have got the regulators
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  they have got a lot of that in place
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  but now they are creating
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  the federal police
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  political police NKVD
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  style units
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  and believe me
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  its not just going to be indictments
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  its not just going to be arrest
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  they have obviously
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  large assassination teams
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  they have been
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  canvassing the US military
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  and mercenaries
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  but there is
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  a boycott within those groups
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  to commit murders against patriots
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  in the United States
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  but they are canvassing
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  and trying to line up
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  large shadow government forces
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  similar to how the Nazis
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  tried to get Spendley Butler to have a coup
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  well this isn't Nazis doing it
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  its communists and big banks
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  its just unbelievable

[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  it's got tentacles into Russia tentacles into China
[24:58.000 --> 25:04.000]  China is probably even just as bad or worse a predator group than the Anglo-American establishment
[25:04.000 --> 25:13.000]  Russia was captured by the Anglo-American establishment through the Bolshevik disease and is halfway pulled itself away from the entity
[25:13.000 --> 25:25.000]  and so is being besieged by economic warfare and destabilization foundations within
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.000]  but Russia still is strong man mafia corruption but it's angelic compared to the eugenicist
[25:32.000 --> 25:39.000]  the Russians are not putting fluoride in their water and cancer viruses in their vaccine for their public
[25:39.000 --> 25:45.000]  and when they bring down the Russians there'll be nothing else standing against them
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  except the American people
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  and that's why we're under attack
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  and the globalist secret weapon is the radical Muslims they're going to turn them loose everywhere
[26:03.000 --> 26:11.000]  in Germany, we told you about this yesterday but this is RT, German parents outrage that for school children asked to make beds cooked for refugees
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.000]  retirees are being thrown out of their homes and the quote immigrants and migrants are being given them
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.000]  the express reports refugees taunt police with selfies showing stolen goods but they can't be arrested
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.000]  they've been told that they are above the law by the French federal police
[26:29.000 --> 26:36.000]  now you think this is over the top, no this is meant to break the will
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  you can rape women you can tell women that they can't you know wear short skirts in Germany and Oktoberfest
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  but if you protest against it you'll be arrested
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  this is the leftist system of tyranny
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.000]  the exact same system you see in Germany is what they're going to have here
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.000]  and when they activate the Justice Department units that are already in place
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.000]  those teams are going to run the false flags in phase one
[27:07.000 --> 27:15.000]  to then have a huge media frenzy and hysteria projecting
[27:15.000 --> 27:24.000]  the school, the federal building, the police station, the state house that gets hit by a quote patriot truck bomb
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  except they know we're on our toes and we're aware of this
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.000]  and so I said when they start trying to indict Ron Paul, Rand Paul, myself, Matt Drudge
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  you may not think Russell Limbaugh is a good guy but they're going to go after him too
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  when they make that move they've already started to indict News Corp
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  so they went and made a deal joining the Democrats two years ago
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  the indictments got dropped
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  the Republican leadership said look just give us money, let us go along with you
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  they're going to be set up in the end and take it out as well
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  they're going to go with a one-party deal here
[27:59.000 --> 28:06.000]  they'll still be somewhat of a Republican party but it's going to be limited
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.000]  this is the takeover, this is America falling, this is it
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  and they will just start arresting people for rebel flags
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  then gadgets and flags, they'll say someone's feelings were hurt
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  oops you resisted the police, you got killed
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  how dare the patriots have blown up that school
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.000]  they'll hit some tear-jerker target
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  and I just don't want to sit here and watch this happen
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  I know the military is beside itself knowing about this
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  military is not perfect but killing America really gets to even the high level brass
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  they know that they've been removing actual military men
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  and they've been putting politicians in
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  this has never before been done at this level
[28:53.000 --> 29:00.000]  they have cold massive numbers of people
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  the purge accelerates
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  I'm going to stay here through this
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  I'm not going to evacuate
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  because if we give in to them they're going to win
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  there's a very good chance they've bitten off way more than they can chew
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.000]  if we get the word out about this plan
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.000]  and about how they're making a federal international
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  domestic force on the ground running your local cities bypassing the states
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  this is the feds, the globalist
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  through the feds taking over the states
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  at the city level
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  with their politically correct community organizing
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  UN federal forces
[29:42.000 --> 29:47.000]  and they say in the Sournav video that their enemy is the patriots
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  the tea party and they're coming for us
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  they're coming
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  we're on the march
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  the empires on the run
[29:54.000 --> 30:00.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.000]  the Obama administration is spending 75 million dollars a year
[30:05.000 --> 30:09.000]  arming special agents with the environmental protection agency
[30:09.000 --> 30:14.000]  with drones, night vision goggles, camouflage, guns and assault ships
[30:14.000 --> 30:18.000]  the EPA is equipping its own army to take out US polluters
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  watchdog group opened the books
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  examined thousands of checks totaling more than 93 billion dollars from 2000 to 2014
[30:25.000 --> 30:29.000]  and they found that 75 million is authorized each year
[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  for criminal enforcement of America's clean air and water laws
[30:33.000 --> 30:36.000]  some of these weapons are for full-scale military operations
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000]  two years ago the EPA was involved in an armed raid at a small town in Alaska
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  where miners were accused of polluting local waters
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  it's incredibly ironic considering that it was the environmental protection agency
[30:48.000 --> 30:53.000]  who was recently guilty of dumping millions of pounds of toxic wastewater
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  into the Animas River in Colorado
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.000]  causing untold damage to the environment for years to come

[33:57.000 --> 34:06.000]  we have Joe Biggs on the line via Skype
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  I don't know how much he wants to identify
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  how successful he's been today but
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  he is there at the Hillary event in San Antonio
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.000]  with the folks, Mr. Castro
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.000]  who it appears is going to be her VP
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  pushing the race division agenda
[34:26.000 --> 34:27.000]  that's part of breaking this country
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  that if you don't let unlimited people come here
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  and pay for everything for free, you're racist
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  and then they create victimology in the people
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  that you only had the babies for free in the welfare
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  and the bad people don't want to give you more
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  because they hate you
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  it's just again total abomination, divide and conquer
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  and he's down there, a lot of folks have shown up down there
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  a lot of info warriors
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  down in San Antonio, we're going to be talking to him in a moment
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  I'm going to write an article with Watson
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  either today or tomorrow
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  it will either be out this afternoon
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  or it will be out in the morning
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  breaking down the history of what I was just getting into
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  but there's thousands of points that go into this
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  but when they start, as I've said hundreds of times
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  inditing Ron Paul, Rand Paul
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  and believe me, that's what this is building up to
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  Ron Paul has said it's political to take his son out of the race
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  he was the front runner just three months ago
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  I've supported Rand Paul
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  even though I've said he hadn't been hardcore enough
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  because I know he's for real
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  and I know his father's for real
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  I know them both well
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.000]  and I'll leave it at that
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  and they're going to probably go after Walter Jones
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  they're going to probably go after people like Webster
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  in Congress
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  they're going to go after the very serious men
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  who are dedicated to the principles of this country
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  and are trying to save it
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  and they're like surgeons in an emergency situation
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  with a shot up victim with 20 gunshot wounds
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  and the globalists are trying to pull them off the patient
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  and the fact that they would
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  indict, and that's how it begins
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.000]  two of Rand Paul and Ron Paul's former staffers
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.000]  is the preparation
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.000]  to try to shut down campaign for liberty
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  that is at the heart
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  of creating and pushing a libertarian constitutional movement
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  in Congress that you see has now removed the speaker
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  and has the votes to block a neocon at this point
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.000]  and so they're letting the polls know right now
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  and they're letting everybody else know
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  you back down, you bow down, you go along with us
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  or we're going to arrest you
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  you wonder why Congress won't stand up to the tyranny
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  it's because they're blackmailed
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  and the polls are as clean as it gets
[37:06.000 --> 37:12.000]  it doesn't matter they can indict a ham sandwich
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  and you need to understand this signifies
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  they're going to come after the guns
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  they're going to say your kids belong to them
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  they're coming with forced immoculations
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.000]  they're coming to make you eat GMO
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  they're putting us under international treaties
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  and won't even let us see them
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  and when we get pieces of it it's so draconian
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  I can't even believe it
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  so here's the newsflash
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  we're already in a semi-captured occupied country
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  but they know they don't run the states completely
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  they don't run the cities completely
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  they don't run the police departments completely
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  they don't run the military completely
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  so they're demoralizing it
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  saying we're going to put women in frontline combat
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.000]  and trannies and make army soldiers wear red high heels in public
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  and we're going to make the U.S. Army services in al-Qaeda
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  to make all the patriots leave
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.000]  and they've come in with for 15 years
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  and only hired police officers in major cities
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  with under 100 IQs
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  they've tried to put idiots in there
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  it still hasn't worked
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  so they show the bad ones to project it onto all the police
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  to bully them and intimidate them in a national terror campaign
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  run out of the wine house
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  that's killed hundreds of police
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  to then make them submit and take all the community organizing
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  political correctness training
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  as the actual U.N. in every major city above 100,000
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  now has offices of up to three people
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  I have like eight of them in the Austin government
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  I know of that liaison and work for the United Nations
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  and now they have infraguard badges
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  that's FBI level badges
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.000]  the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL have these badges
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  they're basically foreign intelligence operatives
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  but they're so basically about it with the ADL
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  and we have been infiltrated
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  we have been completely taken over
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  and now they're getting ready to really come after the American people
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  I just cannot believe they're really doing it
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  they are so bad folks
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  they are so bloodthirsty, they are so hateful
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  they hate us because we're good
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  they hate us because we're not corrupt
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  they want to destroy this country
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  look what they've done with Hollywood and the culture
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  look at how sick America is
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  look what they've done to us
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  and if we just wake up to it
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  which we're starting to do
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  we could get the poison out of us
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  we could vomit out the poison
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  we could convalesce, we could get better
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  but everybody in government especially
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  and I know there's good people there
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  people in government are awake because they're either for it or against it
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  it's so bad now, people realize this is really happening
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  in the military, in the FBI, in the federal marshals
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  there's a lot of bad ones at the top
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  there are a lot of good men and women
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  and they now know this is real
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  and people are really freaked out
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  right down to sergeant level
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  they're asking will you fire on Americans, will you take guns
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  it's in the Army times
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  they've had countless generals
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  you know be quoted in the Washington Post about
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  yeah we'll use foreign troops for civil unrest in America
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  and gun confiscation
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  that's in my film Masters of Terror
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.000]  Washington Post article saying that
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  but they've got to normalize it like it's no big deal
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  Ronald Joe Biggs in one minute
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  they've got to just act like it's yeah
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  we arrest you for the rebel flag now
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  ten years in prison, yeah your kids belong to us
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  we're gonna force them to be inoculated
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  oh yeah the borders are open and you're gonna pay for everybody
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  and the border patrol is gonna ship the illegals in
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  and give them vouchers
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  and then pay seven thousand dollars a month
[41:16.000 --> 41:23.000]  per groups of three to house them
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  and you wonder why suddenly you see demonstrations
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  all over the country with people with communist flags
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  by the hundreds
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  I've been in Austin twice
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  and heard chanting downtown
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  it must be going on all the time
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  and there'll be 200 communists marching
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  with signs saying kill police
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  they're warming up
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  they're getting ready
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  they're coming out of the shadows
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  this is it people
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  this is the takedown
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  the destruction of the United States of America
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  founded in 1776
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  this is traitors cutting us up in pieces
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.000]  and I'm not scared for me
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  I am in mourning
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  when I look at the weird chip on their shoulder
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  mentally ill people
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  when I look at the head of the justice department
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  when I look at Obama
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  when I look at those Democratic members of Congress
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  and the intimidated Republicans are all scared
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  they are a crazed pack of organized thugs
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  they are a mafia
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  they are killers
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  they are trash
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  they would bring in Obamacare
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  doubling and tripling prices
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  on their own idiot constituents
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  they are so ruthless
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  but also they're so weak
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  but our denial has allowed them to take over
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  Joe Biggs is down there
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  he was wearing his Hillary for President shirt
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  but I'm told there's been some new developments
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  down in San Antonio
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  the maps on infowars.com where he's at
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  Hillary's going to be there for another two hours
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  she's speaking at two different events
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  basically promoting a Latin American invasion
[43:02.000 --> 43:07.000]  that's being branded and sold as a race-based consciousness
[43:07.000 --> 43:10.000]  with the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  it's not that Hispanics are bad
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  it's that the government, the Ford Foundation
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  is basically creating a victimology
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  a Euro victim
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  stirring it up
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  some of it's true, you know, 10%
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  90% is bull
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  and then just trying to do what they've done with blacks
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  and if you see how they've totally destroyed the black community
[43:28.000 --> 43:31.000]  and created victimology and dependency
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  they're trying to do it with Hispanics
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  and it's not been really that successful actually
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  they've got almost 70% of Hispanics
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  including illegals who are polled, don't want open borders
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  they're not idiots
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  I mean they know what they just left
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  they don't want that coming here
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  they understand it's massive
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  and it's being coordinated by the globalist
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  and so she's down there invoking race
[43:53.000 --> 43:56.000]  and saying you poor victims, you poor things
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  and beating her evil drum
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  and Joe Biggs is there reporting Joe
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  tell me what you're witnessing with Hillary
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  and what's happened so far
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  I know you've had some success
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  they're Joe Biggs
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  Roger that, Joe
[44:09.000 --> 44:12.000]  actually I'm having an audio in my ear
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  need to fix that
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  I'm standing outside of the historic
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  Sunset Station in San Antonio
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.000]  so far we have been able to
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.000]  basically weasel our way into the Hillary Clinton event
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  and right now as you can see I have on
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  my Hillary t-shirt
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  and I'm standing in front of this
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  Stalin-like photo of Hillary Clinton
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  it's very eerie
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  I'm literally deep in the lines then right now
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  so I've got my Hillary for Prison t-shirt on
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.000]  under here
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  I'm going to release that later
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  once she comes out and speaks
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  and scream Hillary for prison and take this shirt off
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  and then start screaming Hillary for prison
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  and we'll see what happens
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  well Joe it's key you do this
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  we have to get on the offensive
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  everywhere Obama goes
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  you were there with Zachari last week
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  and the rest of the crew
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  Matt and Josh and
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  he had to hide out behind the college
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  and they just shot it with a
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  camera hand held without a lapel mic
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  horrible audio and you could tell he was like
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  a cornered cornered rat
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  and
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.000]  it just shows we have to get on the offensive
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  you just heard me break down
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  that they are going to federalize all local departments
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  under the UN and
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  they now put out a hour and a half
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  video report we're going to be playing parts of later
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  where they admit it's all southern primary law center run
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.000]  with local spies and they will be arresting people
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  for their political views
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  and they're announcing that the patriots are going to be blowing everything up
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  and the big war is about to be with the tea party
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  that will start carrying out terror
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  of course the tea party doesn't do that
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  they're going to start blowing stuff up and saying we did it
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  we've caught them before at Oklahoma City
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  so it's now completely clear
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  what they're doing it is
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  over the top
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  it's the standard deal where they do five minutes on fallen troops
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  to terrorist overseas
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  then they shift into domestic groups
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  the tea party, the gun owners, the veterans
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  so they're going operational with this now
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  and it really shows
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  moving to
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  we've indicted two of
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  Rand Paul's and Ron Paul's staffers
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  and that of course is to
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  try to get them to flip
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  on the Paul's
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  obviously Drudge was here last week to say they're coming after us
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  and in private he told me even more
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  Drudge is at the highest
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  levels
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  he talks to you name it
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  not just Supreme Court justices I'll leave it at that
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  and the Republicans have been told
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  you submit or we're going to arrest you
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  and we are going to take the free speech
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  and we are going to put the tea party in prison
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  so
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  I mean it's on and that doesn't intimidate me
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  I can't believe
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  we're going to let this happen we've got to get in their face
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  call them out as criminals
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  and really show what they've done
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  and a lot of foreign leaders
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  are saying Obama's mentally ill
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  you look at the attorney general she looks like a crazy lady
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  with a chip on her shoulder
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  I mean these
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  this is a bunch of crazy community communist
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  organizers and big banks
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  who really think they're going to be able to take down the United States
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.000]  they're trying to take down Russia
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  right now I mean they're crazy
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  they think we're so down they fund Al Qaeda
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  publicly
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  I mean I know the military is waking up you talk about it Joe
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  give me your take on what we were just breaking down
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  I mean one of the interesting things is though
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  a lot of people that come here they come here
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  for the fact that they're quote unquote feminist
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  and they come out here and they're like
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  Hillary's for women well first of all
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  Hillary Clinton covered for her husband
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  who was doing stuff so that kind of goes against
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  feminism
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  herself cheats as well and then
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  she also takes money the Clinton foundation
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  takes money from Arab nations
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  that literally degrade women
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  don't let them show themselves
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  have to cover up their entire bodies
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  are not equal to men, can't get jobs
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  can't do anything and yet
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  these women that come out here and scream that
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  Hillary for women are just completely and totally
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  demented delusional mentally ill
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  however you want to put it and then you have
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  a whole large crowd over here to my left because
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  we're inside like I said the lion's den
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  I'm in Hillary Clinton territory right now
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  there's hundreds of people here ready to
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  find out what kind of free stuff they're going to get
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  for voting for her
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  one of them even cares about
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  the American men and women who have gone
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  overseas to fight for this country
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  they don't care about them getting
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  the healthcare that they deserve the education
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  anything like that no no no everybody wants
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  to come on into America open the borders
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  and get their free ride to whatever
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  else there is out there so we're going to
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  sit here and talk to people and find out
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  why they like her
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  well it's identity politics they don't
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  care if Clinton settled cases with women
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  he raped they don't care
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  if Hillary
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  is involved in all sorts of evil
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  corruption and fast and furious
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  they like to feel powerful through
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  her
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  it's like a five-year-old boy imagining
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  he's Batman or Superman
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  they are they are posers
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  and so that's who they are
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  and also when you talk
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  to them they are incredibly stupid
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  they are they are
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  sheep oriented
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  and they are just pathetic
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  I mean they are just idiots
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  Hillary wants to allow families
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  of victims who die in mass shootings
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  to be able to sue gun manufacturers
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  I mean that is the most ridiculous thing in the world
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  and they are already setting up presidents right now
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  a lawsuit just happened in Wisconsin
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  I think it was yesterday an article came out
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  in a Chicago newspaper and RT as well
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  where
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  two police officers were shot
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  by someone who basically
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  got a gun through a straw purchase
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  and six million dollars has been awarded
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  to the two shooting victims
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  and they are getting that from
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  the store
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  so you know here they are
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  they are going to push this whole thing
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  we are going to go after straw purchases
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  but meanwhile like you said we had fast and furious
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  what was that they allowed these straw purchases to happen
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  they allowed these guns to go around and what happened
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  we lost an American board patrol agent
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  from that so they flip flop on everything
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  they say they are against this but then they are really for it
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  I mean it's disgusting to be here
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  they have this shirt on me right now
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  they have this stolen picture of Hillary
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  and by the way I am not being mean to fat people
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  I have been overweight as well
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  and they have mainstream articles asking the question
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  why lesbians are three times
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  larger on average than the average
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  woman's weight
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  why are Hillary supporters normally 300 pounds
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  I mean that's another question
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  well this is the first time I have ever been around this much
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  at one time
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  it really makes me nervous but
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  as I look around I do have to say I agree with you there
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  on that one Alex
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  there are a lot of clump Hillary supporters
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  here today
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  but because these just these people are just
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  zombies
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  I guarantee you most of them don't work
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  they sit in front of the television all day
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  they consume all day
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  that's all they want they are here to find out
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  what other free things they can get to consume as well
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  Joe stay there you are doing an incredible job

[54:10.720 --> 54:12.960]  Historic events are taking place.
[54:12.960 --> 54:22.160]  Our will is being broken. Our finances are being destroyed. We're being maneuvered
[54:24.640 --> 54:29.760]  into total control. This is 21st century warfare.
[54:32.080 --> 54:35.840]  And we're not being alarmist here. We have incrementally been brought into this tyranny.
[54:37.680 --> 54:41.120]  I was going to have Robert Kiyosaki, who's a great gas free market guy,
[54:41.120 --> 54:44.800]  on about where he sees the world today. I am going to move him the next week.
[54:47.440 --> 54:58.400]  Because we have the breakdown and the transcript. Richard,
[54:58.400 --> 55:03.040]  can you bring that sheet back in here, please? I thought I had it.
[55:03.040 --> 55:09.760]  But with the quotes, we now have the video clips ready from the hour and a half
[55:10.880 --> 55:19.920]  Justice Department meeting. Thank you. Where it says that the anti-government groups,
[55:19.920 --> 55:23.280]  sovereign citizen movements, are the number one threat.
[55:23.280 --> 55:33.120]  And the same sentence says with attacks on synagogues and mosques.
[55:33.120 --> 55:37.920]  So it's saying that the patriot groups are going to attack mosques, basically, and synagogues.
[55:39.040 --> 55:42.880]  And domestic terrorism initiative announcement, threat of influence on the internet,
[55:42.880 --> 55:47.360]  social media, that'll be the censorship, the strong cities network, federalizing police,
[55:47.360 --> 55:51.360]  circumventing the states. And if your governor stands up against it, or your attorney general,
[55:51.360 --> 55:54.080]  like Texas, they just indict you.
[55:58.880 --> 56:01.840]  The definition of the codebook of domestic terrorism.
[56:01.840 --> 56:06.640]  So Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former policy head of the department of the treasury,
[56:06.640 --> 56:11.120]  former editor, the editor of the Wall Street Journal, will be joining us on the insanity
[56:11.120 --> 56:24.080]  with Russia and the rest of the world. And man, when you look at the body language of Biden and
[56:24.080 --> 56:29.920]  the attorney general in these meetings, they are just crazed. They are just like, we're coming,
[56:29.920 --> 56:33.520]  we're ready, we're going to fight these people. We're just sitting here going, what are we doing?
[56:33.520 --> 56:36.480]  We just don't want you to bankrupt the country and take our guns. They're like,
[56:36.480 --> 56:41.680]  bitter clingers, we're coming. Remember those Democratic Party internal
[56:41.680 --> 56:46.880]  circulations where they said, don't worry, the Democrats are going to be in power,
[56:46.880 --> 56:50.320]  don't think we're in trouble. There's going to be terror attacks in America
[56:50.960 --> 56:55.600]  before Obama leaves office. This is on Fox News, and the Republicans are going to be blamed.
[56:57.440 --> 57:01.920]  I mean, when there's an attack, folks, they stand to gain. They're framing everybody.
[57:01.920 --> 57:06.880]  I mean, the White House is so evil, and I'm going back to Joe Biggs with us for five more minutes.
[57:09.920 --> 57:15.840]  They're so evil that they've actually launched an initiative with Soros-funded groups
[57:15.840 --> 57:19.680]  who start the chance to kill the pigs, deck the halls with dead cops.
[57:23.680 --> 57:25.520]  I mean, that's who runs the government, people.
[57:25.520 --> 57:32.880]  Do you understand how serious this is? And people are like, well, the cops are corrupt,
[57:32.880 --> 57:39.760]  so what? It's a trap. It's a setup. It's mind control, like projecting and telling the Hispanics
[57:39.760 --> 57:44.240]  that whites all hate them, or saying, because there's some bad cops out there out of three
[57:44.240 --> 57:49.440]  million cops that all the cops are bad. It's all mind control. It's identity politics,
[57:49.440 --> 57:54.240]  putting us in groups, and it puts the cops in groups so they follow their orders,
[57:54.240 --> 57:57.760]  they circle their wagons, and then the bosses tell them, go under the feds,
[57:58.320 --> 58:02.800]  go to the Southern Property Law Center event, go under the UN, and you won't get in trouble
[58:02.800 --> 58:09.520]  if you shoot somebody. They're politically have to join the cult now, or they're going to indict
[58:09.520 --> 58:16.800]  them or kill them. God, this is a sick takeover. I mean, it is just at every level. Listen,
[58:16.800 --> 58:20.640]  I didn't plug anything in the shower, and we need funds around this operation. I've got great water

[58:44.320 --> 58:50.880]  real. Believe me. Imagine being me, man. They're going to come. Listen, I'm a major target.

[59:53.120 --> 59:55.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:55.840 --> 01:00:08.800]  All right, Alex Jones, you're alive. Let's fade this down.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.320]  During the break, security started coming over to Joe Biggs and the crew, the camera person.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:21.280]  Didn't matter, Josh, go with him today. Michael's down there. Great. And our new camera guy doing
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.480]  a great job. And so they're now circling. They're inside the Hillary event at one of the city
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.360]  community centers. He got a pass. They let him in. Will they throw him out now? Because he doesn't
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.840]  agree with her lord and savior and might actually do some real coverage. Joe Biggs, what's happening?
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.720]  So there's different guys. Every time I turn around, there's a different cop hiding behind a
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:44.160]  bush. Everybody is staring at me. The Secret Service keeps, they keep walking around and
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.240]  you'll see them peek around to see what I'm doing. You know, they know exactly who I am.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.080]  And it's going to be interesting to see what happens. I think they're all just kind of like
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.760]  trying to get a perimeter around me to see what kind of hijinks I'm going to pull,
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.200]  which obviously I am because I mean, that's what I do. But, uh,
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.760]  But nothing illegal. I mean, I mean, you're just there to cover it.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.560]  Well, no, no, no.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.600]  And you're there so they can try to arrest you and look like tyrants they are.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.400]  The guy at the front gate obviously didn't know how to do his job. That's his own fault.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.920]  So if anybody is to blame, it'll be that guy. I'm not on the list.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.280]  Well, no, I mean, the guy's not being a tyrant, Joe. I mean, they let you in.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:23.440]  Yeah. And I even got this completely horrible Hillary Clinton Stalin t-shirt
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.400]  with my credentialed Hillary Clinton pass that, uh,
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.240]  and I have some posters and some goodies for us to bring back.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:37.840]  Don't you love how Obama and her always copy communist iconography? I mean, it's so in our face.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.360]  Hey, listen, look, come here, get another shot of this. I mean, this is just out of control.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.320]  You got to get this picture.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.760]  Oh, we've been showing it.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:49.520]  It's just reminds me of watching like an old war movie when they're
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.360]  overseas. It's just I can't believe it.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.120]  Can you believe they say that they're going to have a war with the Patriots?
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.240]  They're really going to do it, Joe.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:04.080]  I mean, this and then they'll sit back in DC and in London and in New York,
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.880]  you know, in places while all this goes on. I mean,
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.360]  do you really think the military and the police are going to follow these orders
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.040]  and buy into the stuff they're going to pull?
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.040]  I'm sure there's always going to be a few red coats or a few turn coats.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.480]  We're going to, uh, you know, uh, just follow orders and, you know,
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.320]  be bootlickers and do what they have to do.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.480]  But I would have to say, you know, 90%, 95, probably even more than that.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.720]  We're going to, you know, look at this guy, look at that order.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.880]  Whenever it comes down to go, you know, it's screw you.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.760]  I'm going over here. I'm staying with my people.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.960]  I'm not going to follow those orders.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.360]  I mean, we keep seeing sheriff after sheriff across the country stand up and come out and
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.440]  publicly state, make a YouTube video or, uh, have that's right. And that's the answer.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:46.720]  You enemies, you, you, you serpers, you scum can't get us all. That's the key.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.320]  Yeah. Everyone starting to speak out, you know, and it's good when you have these
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.880]  sheriffs coming out and saying, Hey, I'm going to follow the Constitution.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.640]  If you give me an unlawful order, I will not follow it. I will not go out.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.080]  I will not take people's guns. I will not pay force people to do, you know,
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.320]  something that's against the Constitution. And that's great.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.760]  It's great that these sheriffs are coming out like the ones in Houston,
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.520]  the ones all across like, uh, and they're going to try to demoralize this and tell us
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.120]  we're losing if the civil war kicks off. We're not losing. We're winning.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.560]  Always remember that as long as you're fighting back in the info war
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.960]  and defending yourself, if you have to, you're winning resistance is victory. Joe, isn't it?
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.360]  Well, look at this though. I want to show it really quick.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.040]  There you go. That's right. The Hillary for prison shirt.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.760]  And that's exactly where she needs to go. These people, we need a Nuremberg trial in this country.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.480]  Joe, I watched the schedule down there.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:43.840]  Well, right now, right now she is at an event at the Hispanic commerce chamber commerce right now.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.440]  And that's like a, it seemed to be a private event. This is the public event here.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.880]  So everybody's been lining up. We pulled up in a San Antonio.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.440]  They were literally probably 400 people wrapped around the road waiting to come in here.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.760]  And this place is starting to pack in. They've got the front packed in here. The people on the
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.160]  stage. It looks like a lot of Hispanic women who are up on the stage out there.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.280]  And they keep doing these little Hillary chants back and forth from time to time.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.200]  And then they have free water and they took the water and they took the labels off and
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:16.160]  they put Hillary Clinton labels on the water. And they're giving that out for free.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.160]  Well, they have the kids pray in Venezuela. I used to hear this, but then it was on the news.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.760]  They have the kids pray in kindergarten, first grade from milk from Jesus and cereal,
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.720]  then it isn't there. And then they say pray to Hugo Chavez when he was alive and now after he's dead
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.240]  and then they give him the milk and then they give him the, and then if they really pray hard,
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.560]  they give him a little, little sugar cube. It's just Pavlovian brainwashing. Joe,
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.480]  we're going to keep monitoring what you're doing while Paul Craig Roberts is on with us.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.720]  So stay connected, walk around, cover whatever you want. And then if you give us, you know,
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:53.680]  a Mayday signal, if they're jumping on you, we'll go right back to you. Joe Biggs reporting from
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:59.280]  San Antonio. They'll be popping in throughout the hours. We're going to play these clips coming up in
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:06.640]  the next hour. And yet another land grab, the BLM, the Bureau of Land Management, is ignoring the
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:12.240]  real estate title given by the state of Texas 74 years ago to a farmer. Now the same bureaucracy
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.720]  that has ignored property rights for ranchers like Clive and Bundy in Nevada, ignored property rights
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:22.480]  for minors in Oregon and elsewhere is coming after the property of a Texas farmer. The BLM has decided
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.760]  they will move the boundary, take half his land and his house. Congress has allowed bureaucracies
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.240]  to grow unchecked because Congress doesn't like to pass laws. They have advocated their
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:37.120]  constitutional duty to bureaucracies who not only write the law, but often act as their own police
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.480]  force and run their own court. No one in either party in Washington wants to change it. These
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.600]  bureaucracies will destroy every last remnant of your God given constitutionally protected rights,
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:53.760]  including your property rights, unless they're stopped by you, by the people at the state
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:06:19.760]  and the local level. For more information, go to infowars.com. I'm David Knight.

[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:18.960]  because there's a war on for your mind. For the next 52 minutes, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts,
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:23.760]  former head of policy at the Treasury, the father of Reaganomics, former chief editor at
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:30.400]  the Wall Street Journal, will be joining us. He's been part of some of the biggest foundations.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.120]  He was part of the deal for the transition of the Soviet Union into what it is today.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:42.400]  He's won some of the top international awards. And of course, he doesn't really talk about that.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.760]  The point is he has a lot of gravitas. He is a high level economist. He's been listed in major
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.640]  publications as one of the top 10 economists the last 50 years. He knows what he's talking about.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.200]  And obviously, we're going to try to get into the economy some today. That's clearly deteriorating
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.920]  where he thinks that's going. The situation with Russia, the fact that the momentum has shifted,
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:07.280]  and the world really is turning against the criminals that run the United States. They're
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.040]  not invincible. And once they start failing on any front, their whole system will collapse
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:19.440]  like Napoleon or Hitler marching into Russia. And we use that analogy for a reason.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:25.600]  But first off, I'm going to be writing a big article today with Paul Watson and going over the fact.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.160]  And I want to get Robert's take on this because he talks a lot about the police state,
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:36.240]  the billions of bullets, the armored vehicles, the army times admitting it's for the Tea Party and
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:43.120]  gun owners. Ron Paul's former chief of staff, Rand Paul's former chief of staff indicted
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:51.840]  for nothing, forgiving campaign money to libertarians to have them run for office.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.040]  They're calling that's a payoff for endorsing Rand Paul or something. Just incredible.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.800]  They've indicted the Texas Attorney General. I know they're trying to indict the governor of Texas.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:08.160]  This is real political persecution. People flying battle flags in Georgia, 15 of them
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.280]  have been charged with terrorism because they flew them on their trucks at a park.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.120]  Good people's feelings were hurt. And they're being charged. We showed the video from the
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.520]  Southern Barbary Law Center. They're being charged for driving away saying, we'll see you guys,
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:31.680]  have a good day. This is the new persecution. Radical Muslims pouring into Europe.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.720]  If you criticize them, you're arrested. Your children are taken.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.120]  Zuckerberg caught on tape saying, you know, he's going to censor the web.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.240]  It's here. It's to a new level and now.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.600]  And I want to get his take on this. Then we'll get into Russia and the geopolitical issues.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.880]  And in the next hour, I'm going to play these clips. No one has covered this shit but UPI.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:03.520]  And the Justice Department put a press release out. This is so huge. We're going to play the video
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:08.960]  clips here where they say that they're basically preparing for a civil war with the Tea Party,
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.680]  libertarians, conservatives, and they're preparing for acts of terror by the Tea Party,
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.320]  and that through the safe cities move with the United Nations directing it,
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:23.760]  they're going to federalize local police and they're creating a new Justice Department
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:30.960]  anti-terror unit basically run by the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL to go out and politically
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:40.720]  target people. And this is the main new national security position for the Domestic Terrorism
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:47.680]  Council saying that homegrown, libertarian, conservative terror will be the new menace.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:51.200]  Now we got the secret documents six, seven years ago. We broke them. People didn't believe
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.880]  it. It was confirmed real where they said Ron Paul, Aaron Russo's film, Info Wars and some of the
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.600]  documents. If you see somebody with a get us out of the UN sticker on their car, go ahead and arrest
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:07.600]  them. So they're trying to get the police to believe free speech is illegal and it's starting to happen.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.760]  And so clearly they're going to pull, I believe, some false flags and try to frame the Liberty
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:20.320]  Movement. Clearly they've tried to frame Russia for events. Russia didn't commit. They tried to
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.760]  frame Syria for chemical attacks. They didn't commit. Our government is clearly funding ISIS
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.840]  and al-Qaeda. The former head of defense intelligence went public and said they were ordered to do that
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:34.640]  two months ago. We've played that clip. So the good news is there's a lot of people in government
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.720]  speaking out against this. Foreign ministers are saying they believe Obama is mentally ill.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.920]  The neocons are clearly mentally ill, but we've always talked about this tyranny cresting and
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:55.200]  historically, tyrants don't quit. They always go too far. And in World War II, more than 50 million
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.960]  people died, most of them civilians. And many historians are saying the parallels to World
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.120]  War I, World War II, and the Cuban Missile Crisis are legions. So we'll get into Russia,
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.000]  get into the economy, but first before we go to break it, about six, seven minutes, Dr. Roberts
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.160]  joins us. His website is excellent. You can read his syndicated column there, paulcraigroberts.org.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.720]  His most recent book is titled How America Was Lost. And I have never been in such deep
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:30.400]  mourning, Dr. Roberts. And I know you've been not cynical, but, you know, almost gallows humor
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:36.640]  laughing about this yourself. I am just struggling with my instinct to get my family out of the
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:41.200]  country. I've pledged to stay here and try to fight this. I know I couldn't live with myself if
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.080]  I didn't stay, but I know for a fact that they've got the FBI for two years digging into me under
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.080]  White House orders. I've confirmed this from people in the government directly from with agents.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:57.760]  And the FBI can't find anything. So they're being ordered now. And I was told, well, new
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:01.120]  units are going to be created and they're creating political offices that are going to go after
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:07.040]  everybody. And now you see what's happening to the polls. And I told people before it was even
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.920]  in the news that we're going to indict the attorney general in Texas. And I have obviously
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:14.400]  a lot of high level sources. I know you have a lot of high level sources as well. But this really
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:19.360]  is the breaking of America right now in the long breath before the plunge, in my view,
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.200]  to total totalitarianism. And I think they're probably going to arrest you too. What do you
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:28.800]  have to say about that? Well, I think all of it's possible except the part about the UN.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.520]  It won't have anything to do with the UN. It certainly won't be managed by the UN.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.880]  Well, I'm not saying they're going to run it, but they say under treaty and under agreement.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:41.840]  I can show you an associated press. It'll have nothing whatsoever to do with the UN.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.080]  Okay, we'll break it down in your view then, what I just talked about.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:53.680]  Well, it'll strike most people as Alex had gone further off the wall. But I do think that we
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:15:04.160]  have seen many signs of the police state. In fact, we can say that it was established
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:16.800]  when the George W. Bush administration announced that it had the right to detain American citizens
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:24.800]  indefinitely without presentation of evidence or without a warrant or without going to a court.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:31.200]  The fact that they got away with that was all you need to know that there was a police state
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.720]  because that's strictly unconstitutional. Nothing was done about it.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.840]  The Justice Department is so totally corrupt. They were writing, having memos written to
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:52.880]  justify the assumption of dictatorial power by the president, placing his actions above
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:16:00.960]  constitutional control. The two parties involved in these memos, one of them is now a professor
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:07.040]  of constitutional law. The University of California, Berkeley, Bolts School of Law,
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:18.400]  and the other is a federal judge. So this is all you need to see that it's a police state.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:27.120]  The Berkeley Law School took a guy who wrote memos justifying torture, which is strictly
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:33.840]  illegal under both U.S. law and under international law. Of course, John Hughes,
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.000]  Alberto Gonzalez, and others openly said they could even bury people alive,
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.760]  rip their fingernails out, anything they wanted.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.160]  John Hughes wrote the memo and this other guy, I think it was his name, was it baby,
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:52.080]  baby or something like that? Yes, the issue is though it was adopted by the government as if it
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:17:05.120]  was legitimate. Well, it was asserted by the Bush administration and the Department of Justice
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:12.480]  had these guys write these memos that had no basis in law to justify an assertion of power
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:16.400]  and nobody did anything about it. The Congress didn't do anything about it, of course.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:23.520]  So that showed that there was a police state, and of course then Bush's successor had a chance
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:30.640]  to correct all that. Instead, he just went further because he added to this assertion
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:37.200]  of indefinite detention his right to murder U.S. citizens without due process of law,
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:46.000]  Indiana, and proceeded to do so. So I don't think you need any memos or anything else because
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.320]  that's all the evidence you need that you have. You have a police state and I think also when you
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:59.840]  see the continuing murder of unarmed U.S. citizens by the police who are supposed to be protecting
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:06.720]  them and very, very little accountability of the police who commit these crimes.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:15.440]  In most cases, nothing happens to them. Then you can see again that American citizens no
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.600]  longer have the protection of law. Then you can say from their own police and the police murder
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:28.400]  and abuse at will and very, very little if anything happens. It's very rare that a police officer is
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:36.960]  held accountable for his crimes. So I think that's about all the evidence you really need, Alex,
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:46.080]  and I don't know how. Well, the point I'm getting to is they are heating it up. They are clearly
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:51.120]  going after people like Dinesh D'Souza for a speech. They're clearly going after Rand Paul now.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:58.400]  They're clearly, the persecution is accelerating and the Justice Department,
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:03.120]  to be clear, and I have associated press right here. I understand that it's not the U.M. that's
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:09.840]  going to run it all, but the U.N. they're following U.M. guidelines in a U.N. initiative
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:16.240]  on the quote hate speech to restrict free speech. So they're claiming that as their authorization
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.240]  and as their directive. Look, they can claim anything. I just told you if they can claim
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.840]  that the president is above the law and not subject to constitutional restraint,
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.920]  they can claim anything. That's what I'm getting at. So I'm saying the fact that they're creating
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:35.360]  a new anti-terrorism unit and saying they're preparing for this conflagration. Obviously,
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.000]  we've seen their past activities. What I'm saying is they're moving into a new level
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:49.120]  of draconian action in my view. No doubt about it. I mean, just look at the persecution of whistleblowers.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:57.600]  So I think that this is all realistic and it doesn't need to be understated or overstated.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:03.440]  It's just a fact. You know, at the time when Bush made that announcement, he could put Americans
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:10.320]  under indebted tension. I said this will be covered up with the claim that he's only doing this to
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:16.880]  terrorist. But once you breach that, you do it to everybody. I pointed out over and over and over
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:24.480]  that the law expands to the limits of its logic. That's right. And just like the RICO Act was only
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:31.600]  to get the mafia. Now it's used in divorce courts. That's right. So it's clear it's going to go that
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:40.160]  way. And the real question is if they are busy at war with their own people, how they're going to be
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:50.960]  at war everywhere else, much less with Russia and China. And I think that one of the signs of hope
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:59.600]  is the two speeches that Obama and Putin gave at the U.N. on the 28th of September. Because the
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:08.320]  whole world saw that Obama was a stooge, a liar, a deceiver, and that Putin was a statesman who
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:15.600]  told the truth and stood up. So I think you've seen a sea change in the power in the world.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:24.240]  The United States is no longer a unipower. It's a semi superpower, certainly behind the Russians,
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:30.720]  probably also behind the Chinese. And so the alteration of the American position in the world,
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:38.000]  and then look at what's happening to the empire. Look what's happening in Europe. Europe is being
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:47.280]  overrun with refugees that doesn't want, has no place for. All because the idiot Europeans
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:54.960]  enabled Washington's wars in the Middle East. So they've got to be sitting there thinking,
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:03.200]  what dults we were? Look what we get for being Washington's vassals. They also now,
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:09.680]  having seen Russia stand up and simply tell us no. You know, the statement that Putin made was that
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:16.320]  we can no longer tolerate the state affairs in the world. That is a declarative sentence.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:21.600]  It says that's it. We're not putting up with anything else. Two days later, he's taken over
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:29.440]  the war in Syria. We can't do anything about it. Bluster. So the power in the world has changed.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:35.200]  We've lost our moral high ground. We've never had it. We've lost the pretense of it. Yes.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:44.080]  Yeah. We've lost the mask is off. The world looks at us totally different. They say, hey,
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:47.680]  look, we don't have to be afraid of the bully anymore because we've got the Russians and
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:56.160]  Chinese standing up to them. And even the Iranians stood up to us. So I think that, you know,
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:02.960]  how is a country that's beleaguered abroad whose empire is tolering is now going to make war on
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:07.760]  its own people. I believe, I believe you're probably right that they intend to do that.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:15.920]  But, you know, you go from weakness to weakness. No, I agree. The good news is, is they're so
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:20.640]  discredited and people in government are pretty upset that I talked to two. I think the mass
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.960]  is coming off here. And so a lot of this may just be bluster. I mean, it's going to get really
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:30.720]  obvious if they indict every member of the Tea Party. It could be. I'm told that today I was
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:36.320]  told, but, you know, you never know what people tell you. They're trying to plant ideas or stories
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:41.760]  or they got an agenda. But I was told today something that sort of surprised me and that is
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:49.680]  that there's a tremendous amount of opposition within police forces themselves to this militarization
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:24:01.440]  of the police to, to these brutal acts. And that the situation is, is not quite what it looks like
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:07.280]  on the surface. Now, if this is true, I agree with that. If this is true, it's good news. Now,
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:14.160]  if they're going to start indicting attorney generals of Texas and the governor and, and ruining
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:22.160]  U.S. senators, people will see that. And you got to remember to the polls, Alex. You remember
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:29.440]  not long ago, we saw the poll that 62% of Americans favored a third party. This is brand new.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:38.640]  We saw that 75% of Americans thought that government at all levels was corrupt. This is brand new.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:46.720]  So if these polls are correct, and so perhaps you've been successful in waking people up.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:52.080]  Well, I think we all have together. You certainly and others get credit. They see the polls as kind
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.640]  of the tip of the spear, because they know they're for real as well. But what do you expect though
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:01.840]  with the history of hubris and being in Washington? I mean, obviously we weren't perfect then, but
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:06.160]  compared to the Soviet Union, I'd say we were the good guys and you were there. Reagan tear down
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:11.840]  that wall. That did put pressure on the Russians. It did help reform things. And we now see a shift
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.640]  where it's like Putin's like Reagan saying to us, stop being tyrants and saying, look what you've
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.840]  done in the Middle East, funding ISIS and al-Qaeda, shame on you. Just it's like the emperor's new
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.880]  clothes. Putin really is being a statesman. What do you expect them to do now to try to counter that?
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.760]  I think the CIA would try to assassinate him.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:38.640]  I think Putin's in substantial danger of assassination. That's what I think.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.120]  And I hope he stops walking around the streets unprotected.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:50.160]  And no American president can do that. Only Putin.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.920]  Well, he's not a coward. That's for sure. Well, I mean, the other people there don't want to kill
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:05.600]  him. So I think that Putin's in danger of assassination by the CIA or some or some rogue group.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:11.440]  They're probably rogue groups that are far worse than the CIA. Of course. And we just don't know
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:21.600]  about them. And so I think they hear they will continue to persecute whistleblowers.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:30.320]  They will continue to move in the direction that criticism of the government is illegal.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:40.480]  And they'll first say, you know, you're a domestic extremist. And they'll find somebody that's easy
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:49.120]  for people not to like and go along with. And then the next guy will not quite be so easy to dislike.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:53.520]  And then finally, they'll get who they want. That's the way it goes. Exactly.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:27:02.000]  So I think that is in in motion. But I do think now there's more awareness.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:13.040]  I don't know to what agreement they would be able to bring military officers.
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:20.640]  Some of them I know are useless and rotten and no good. And others have integrity. So it's not
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.960]  it's not a clear open road for them. I think you're right that they're going in this direction.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:36.480]  But whether they can pull it off, I don't know, I think they're going to have more problems than
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:43.600]  they can handle. For example, the economy. I can't really stay the whole hour.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:47.360]  I understand that they told me an hour before I know you got to go. Can you do 10 more minutes
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:53.440]  to tell us what the economy? Yeah, because that's another problem for them. And all of these things
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:59.440]  can overwhelm them. And I mean, the thing can collapse out from under them. I mean, the economy,
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:05.360]  you know, look, it's a house of cards. We've talked about it. They've kept it up by creating money
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:12.640]  to sustain all the bad investments the banks made. But the economy itself is not growing.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.360]  Retail sales aren't growing. Real consumer incomes are declining. They're going down.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:28.480]  There's no basis for the economy to grow. They create the image of success by manipulating
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:32.400]  the figures and the way they measure unemployment, the way they measure inflation.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:40.800]  And so they're trying to create a matrix, an image of success that's not there.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:52.080]  The dollar is rigged. It's the only way it can stand. It's rigged because the Japanese print
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:57.920]  to support it, the European Central Bank prints to support it. But now look what's happening in Europe.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.040]  I mean, they're overwhelmed with their own sovereign debt problems. Now millions of refugees.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:06.480]  But we're going to break. We'll come back and do five minutes on the side and let you just focus
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:12.000]  in on a briefing, you know, as a former top economist in the White House on where you see
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.800]  this going. And I want to ask you when we come back that other key question,
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.880]  what does it signify that other central banks and now the Chinese are not buying as many U.S.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:26.640]  treasuries? They're saying the economy's not as good as it was previously. I want to find out from
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:31.360]  you as an economist, where you think the real state of the U.S. versus the global economy is
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.080]  and what you expect to come next. Paul Craig Roberts will do five, six minutes with us on
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:41.920]  the other side of the break. His website is PaulCraigRoberts.org. And then I'm going to get into
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:47.680]  a bunch of the election news, a bunch of the Europe news, second amendment news. It's all coming
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:57.120]  up. Stay with us. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:07.120]  Indiana Sheriff Brad Rogers made his stance on the second amendment clear during a recent interview.
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:13.040]  If President Obama today said, I'm creating an executive order that all sheriffs and police
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.680]  chiefs around this nation need to start registering firearms, I will disregard it.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:22.080]  Presidential candidate Jim Webb defended the second amendment rights of Americans during the
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.520]  first democratic debate. And he actually called out his fellow politicians on their hypocrisy.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:34.960]  There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:40.000]  week. The average American does not have that and deserves the right to be able to protect
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.440]  their family. And Webb's point echoes recent comments made by media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:52.080]  I challenge Hillary, take away your secret service, dismiss them. I dare you. Obama, same thing.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:56.000]  Leave the White House unguarded Obama. You know what would happen in 30 seconds?
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.040]  Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth. Read more now at infowars.com.

[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:04.640]  Hey, how you doing? Good, brother. Just recently started using your products. Everything you said
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:09.040]  about them is correct. Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and that's made a lot of changes
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:12.320]  in our lives here. Well, thank you, brother. It's because it also funds our operation,
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.800]  but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:21.280]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of

[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:42.320]  planet, and then concentrated, or maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down,
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:46.640]  and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience,
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:51.280]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:56.800]  exciting, and I love it. Visit infowarsalife.com today to secure your super male vitality

[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:30.480]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen to the Alex Jones show. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.400]  We are here, live, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central now. We've added an hour,
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:40.080]  and of course we have the nightly news, seven o'clock Central Standard Time.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:47.120]  And as gloomy as some of what Dr. Roberts is talking about here, the good news is the world
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:51.760]  is waking up to the criminals that have basically occupied our government and taken it over.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.880]  So I would say, in a way, the fact that the empire is in so much trouble
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:00.640]  is a positive thing, but looking at what's happening in the economy, how long can this
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.680]  QE go on? Dr. Roberts, what's the real state of the economy?
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:10.240]  Well, it's in a shambles. There's really no economy here, hasn't been for some time.
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:15.840]  You know, we've talked about it so many times. Firstly, offshored all the well-paid manufacturing
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:23.920]  jobs, then the offshored millions of the professional skill jobs, the kind that are
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:29.440]  exchangeable like software engineering, information technology. So we now have had
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:35.200]  several classes come out of universities, graduates, and there's no employment for them,
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:41.200]  and they can't form households. And they go back and live in their childhood rooms at home,
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:48.880]  or they grow their grandparents, or they pool what little resources they have from being waitresses
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:57.520]  and bartenders and share rents. I mean, you can't really have an economy if the young can't get
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:07.040]  a foot in. So there's no economy here. It's really running on accumulated savings of the past,
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:13.120]  primarily those of the older generation, who are at the point where they have to help their children
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:20.480]  and their grandchildren. So there's no economy here. There are no jobs. The jobs are increasingly
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:30.480]  part-time, low-paid, no benefits. It's a shambles. If you don't have good connections,
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:37.280]  you can't get a job, not one that would permit you to form a household and have an independent
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:43.440]  existence. And we can see this, Alex. You have now the situation where there are all these young
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:51.840]  women who can't pay the student loans, they can't pay the college tuition, the car payments,
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.960]  the rents, and they advertise themselves that they're available to older men who have resources.
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:05.200]  So this is a sign of a third-world country. The United States is a failed state in every respect.
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:11.680]  In every respect, there's no strength here anywhere except in these,
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:18.480]  in whatever this deep government is that's destroying the Constitution and everybody's
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:24.080]  rights. There's no other strength. And so the whole thing can just collapse out of under them.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:29.120]  There's no strength in the West. There's no strength in Europe.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:35.760]  The strength is in Russia and China. It's only places in Australia.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:44.720]  And so we will try to despicableize those countries, as I said earlier. I think Putin is on
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:54.400]  a do for assassination attempt. And the United States now is discredited in the eyes of the world.
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:02.080]  It's discredited with its own vassals. I saw the other day that Australia, a total U.S. puppet
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:09.920]  state, total puppet, it refused to participate in the American naval operations in the South China Sea.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:17.280]  So people are looking at this and saying, well, this doesn't work for us anymore.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:26.160]  We don't want to be drawn into conflict with Russia and China. The United States is no match
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:33.600]  for the combination of Russia and China. No matter what Obama was bragging about at the UN,
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:42.320]  we have the most powerful military, we have the most powerful economy, balda-dash. When Russia hit
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:49.520]  those Islamic State targets with those sea launch cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea,
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:57.040]  that sent fear all up every European spy. They didn't know on you they had these weapons.
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:04.560]  With these types of weapons, an anti-ballistic missile defense is worthless, because it can't
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:11.440]  shoot down cruise missiles. Russia doesn't need ICBMs to take Europe out. European
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:17.360]  know that. They have no protection whatsoever. If they're forced into conflict with Russia,
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:24.800]  they'll disappear instantly. They know that. So the whole thing has changed. I think the change
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:31.440]  came with Obama's speech on the 28th of September. He said, we've had it with you. That's it.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.360]  Two days later, as I said, he's taken over the war in Syria. What can we do about it? Nothing.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:46.880]  Push the button. So I think the economy here is no economy. It's not coming back.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:54.720]  That is probably going to go down further. It could, something sharp could happen in which
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:02.320]  the whole thing just implodes, you know, like a controlled demolition of a building. Or it could
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:08.000]  just be a long, slow, drawn-out process where all the savings in the system are drawn out,
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.880]  and people become progressively poorer year by year, except for the 1%, which sits there
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:22.000]  accumulating whatever surplus is left in the system. This doesn't work. It doesn't work. It
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:30.720]  can't work. It's ignored. All the real problems are ignored. And so they're not dressed. If they're
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:38.800]  not dressed, they can't be fixed. They're fester. They get worse, and they blow up, and the system
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:47.120]  breaks down. I think that that is the most accurate forecast of what's going to happen. In the
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:51.520]  meantime, yes, they may oppress all of us who speak out. They may well do that. You know, it's
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:58.240]  always been the tendency to shoot the messenger. Shoot the messenger. You're a messenger. I'm a
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:07.360]  messenger. Shoot them. And that, and they've got the power to do that. Yes. So, but these are the
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:17.520]  risks you take. They can shoot you wherever you are. Where can you go? In fact, the way that
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:22.560]  the Americans have become hated all over the world, you're not safe anywhere. The people there will
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:30.400]  kill you. Where can you go? You could go to Russia if you learn the language. Probably, you'd be
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:37.520]  safe there. But not necessarily. The CIA may send one of these checking terrorists after you, or
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:44.720]  I mean, you know, Americans aren't safe anywhere. It's not just not safe from the
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.080]  young government. But you know, if the CIA wants to get you, it's easier for them to kill you in
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:54.640]  Mexico than here. That's right. So, you know, the notion of getting out and getting away,
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:03.920]  you know, you can shut up, make an apology, but other than that, you're in it. Oh, I know. I mean,
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:09.680]  I'm in it. I'm never leaving. I was just bemoaning. Just remember that statement, you know, a coward
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:17.680]  dies many times. A brave man dies, but once, that's a much better way to go. Oh, I totally agree. And
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:26.080]  I think, don't worry about it. We're in a fight. Look, if you're in a war, you're going to be killed
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:32.240]  any minute. And you don't say, well, damn, I might be killed. Let's think I'll go home. You got to
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:38.320]  fight. That's my view. So I think you need to keep telling people you don't need to exaggerate.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:43.040]  You don't need to go beyond the evidence. You don't need to go up the wall. You can just
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:49.840]  tell them the facts of what's going on and just come back to the two points I made. Look what
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:54.960]  Bush did. Look what Obama did. We can put you in definite detention despite the Constitution. We
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:42:01.600]  murder you despite the Constitution. If you can do that, that's a police state. Putin can't do that.
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:09.680]  They can't even do that in China. Everybody is subject to law. But us, we've lost the protection
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.160]  of law. You know, that's the book I wrote those years ago, the tyranny of good intentions. The
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:21.920]  title was how the law was lost and the publisher changed it. But we don't have the protection
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:30.960]  of law. And this began before 9-11, before the wars, before Obama and Bush. So if you don't have
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:38.640]  protection of law, you don't have nothing. This is the fact. And by the way, my latest book is
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:45.120]  the Neo-Conservative Threat to World Order. That's the latest book. It's just out.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:49.520]  Well, we need to have you back to talk about that book then. Briefly, I guess it just breaks down
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:56.880]  that the neocons are still in control or? Well, they may not be. I noticed one thing
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:04.320]  recently. It's optimistic. Obama was interviewed on 60 Minutes by some neocon or somebody whose
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:11.440]  mindset is neocon. And the guy was trying to push him into taking aggressive action in Syria.
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:19.120]  And Obama at the very end said, look, what do you want us to do? Repeat all the mistakes we've
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:25.200]  already made, more troops in Syria, more back to Iraq, troops in Libya, troops in Yemen?
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:31.280]  He said, it would be a shame if we can't learn from my mistakes and not repeat them.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:38.800]  Now, that shows that he finally realizes after seven years, he's been a tool of a neocon agenda
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:48.480]  that he said has not served the national interests of the United States. I wrote about this. Go look
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:53.440]  at the interview, just the Syria part of the interview on 60 Minutes. It was very recent.
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:59.920]  I forget the guy's name. It's two weeks ago. Yeah. And I wrote about it just recently. And
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.880]  just go look at that interview toward the very end. This guy keeps trying to push Obama. It's
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:12.560]  all your fault. The Russians are in Syria. You're awake. You wouldn't intervene hard enough. It's
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:22.000]  just like a neocon pushing him. And Obama says, no, we've made those mistakes not anymore. Now,
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:28.720]  I think, and I wrote, I said, this is amazing thing because it's a very lonely and dangerous
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:35.760]  position for Obama to take. So what does it mean? You know, the president is always
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:41.920]  people exaggerate independence of a president. They don't have anything like the independence.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:47.360]  People think, I know I've worked for the president. I know how little independence
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:55.040]  even Reagan had. Obama hasn't any. And yet he made this statement. So it tells me he's
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:00.640]  realized that he's been used for seven years, handed scripts, handed decisions,
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:09.360]  and they failed. And just go read it and see if that exact says in the very end of the serious
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:15.040]  section or just go straight to my column, which we're referencing. And that said, Dr. Paul Craig,
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:19.760]  Roberts dot org or Paul Craig, Roberts dot org. All right, well, very informative. And I guess
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.880]  it's good news in the bad news. But overall, I can see it on the streets. People are waking up or
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:30.720]  they're just getting stupider. Alex, remember, people will fight and resist if they think there's
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:36.160]  hope. So don't take away all the hope. Tell them what's going on. Encourage them.
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:42.240]  Oh, I totally agree. I totally agree with you. But at the same time, I think people come back when
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:46.800]  but I can't really ever do much more than 30 minutes. It's just hard. I understand. All right,
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:49.920]  we'll talk to you again very soon. Congratulations on the new book and thank you for joining us.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:54.480]  Good. It's always good to talk to you. Alex is all the best to you. Thanks a lot.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.880]  There goes Dr. Paul Craig Roberts smart guy. And he's been really pessimistic in the past.
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:06.720]  He seems more positive now. And I want to be clear. I'm not trying to be doom and gloom here.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:13.200]  And I really don't exaggerate what I find is nine times out of 10. I don't
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:18.960]  sometimes I do. But when I go back and really listen to shows and things, I usually underestimate
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:23.760]  it. And I think that's all of our blind spot is that people don't realize when they're facing
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:32.640]  real tyranny. The world still didn't know what Hitler was up to in 1939. There were debates
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:38.160]  in Newsweek magazine or Time Magazine, whether he was a good guy or a bad guy. Timelife books.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:43.200]  Folks were debating into whether the communists were good when Stalin was in power and already
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:49.520]  killed tens of millions. Folks weren't saying Mao was a mass murderer until the 70s.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.720]  I mean, a lot of the conservatives were calling it red China and criticizing it knew what was
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:07.040]  going on. But we just have to admit how corrupt things have gotten. And they are starting to go
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:16.160]  after and indict senators and congressmen and women and governors. We're going to go to break,
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:20.240]  get Joe Biggs to pop in briefly at the Hillary event. I'm sure there's developments there.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:23.680]  I'm sure there has been. He's gotten into the event. She's scheduled to be there in the next
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:26.320]  15 minutes. We'll check in again with him in the next hour.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.920]  But you know, when Robert, I'm going to get an argument with him. He's a smart guy, but
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:37.680]  he's like the UN is not taking over. That's our puppet. I get all that.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:42.560]  But it's international law being adopted.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:51.520]  Just like the gun treaty. They use that to come in then and basically apply it because of treaties
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:57.600]  we've already signed, just like TPP. So there is a method to this. America is meant to be
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:03.440]  brought down into the global system. Roberts just comes from a group of people that actually
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:06.560]  weren't perfect, but wanted to build the country up. So for them, it's just,
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:17.120]  it's just really disgusting. And I get that. But we've got to admit how horrible it is
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:22.400]  to be able to get out of it. That's what's optimistic is to admit that we're overrun
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:27.120]  and to really break with the people that run Washington.
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:33.280]  And I mean, you've got to understand folks that this isn't debatable that this is going on.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:39.920]  As he said, it is a fact, but I think it's good to be emotional about it and aggressive about it,
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.320]  because that's how you get people out of their trance. And I am physically upset. You know,
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:48.560]  when I say I instinctively want to evacuate the country,
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:57.440]  I could move out of the country and the global's would probably never even come after me.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:01.440]  I could go to New Zealand, whatever. I'm never going to do that.
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.760]  Because funny, Roberts gave me a pep talk. Don't leave, you know, don't be positive. You're doing
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:10.800]  a good job. I'm not saying that. It's here watching the country be strangled in front of me
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:16.960]  and knowing that I'm in the crosshairs is a disgusting feeling is what I'm saying.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:21.360]  And in my flesh, in my gut,
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:27.680]  I just don't want to be in the middle of it, but I am and I'm not leaving.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:32.160]  But still, I have that thought. I'd be a liar if I didn't say I wasn't having that thought.

[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:54.000]  this is a weaponized system. I mean that's what it is. It sounds sensational but that's what it is
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:59.600]  and folks from earlier generations that didn't grow up in total mind control
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:06.560]  are pretty much blind to it. They just seem silly and dumb but to the young people

[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:08.720]  plays like a giant toilet actually yeah sure why do you like hillary clinton well many reasons why
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:14.000]  i like hillary most of us well she knows what she's talking about i like carson who let's say says a
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.800]  muslim can't be president but under the constitution anybody can be president unless you're here from
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:23.360]  the united states so ask him if you like sharia law that's pretty cool do you like sharia law
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:29.680]  well no i don't but if you got uh what's his name uh trump to be our president you will
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:35.440]  have sharia law you will also have a lot of sharia law because you have all these abortion
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:41.040]  people saying hey look you know what abortion is bad but we live in a country where pro-choice
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:46.720]  is the way to go because i believe in pro-life actually i'm a christian but that's my view
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:53.280]  that's my belief okay if i lived in a sharia law kind of state then my belief whatever
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:57.120]  well tell him hillary wants to bring millions of radical islamists here that's not right
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.400]  i don't know about big dodgy radical uh islamism here oh really i didn't hear about that how is

[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:56.960]  say there you go i just want you guys to scoot out of the way and be respectful of the people that
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:01.200]  are here no i'm standing here we're still interviewing p-brain roger that u.s america
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:06.480]  ask her if she's for free speech i can interview whoever i want hillary for prison well then how
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:10.560]  about you turn that way then and watch what she's saying and said you're sitting here well then don't
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:15.520]  tell me that you can't hear what she's saying or see that's pretty ignorant right roger that
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:21.520]  so as you can see there's a lot of mindless zombies out here oh i know that's a p-brain right
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:28.880]  there i'm here because hillary for women i think you have one more thing to say uh you talk about
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:34.160]  hillary going to prison this is what's really interesting back in under uh iran contra scandal
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:40.080]  when oragan was lying to the people about selling cocaine we're not been gawzy to him what do you call
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:43.920]  a minority we know about whoa whoa we're not worried about that we know like i don't care about
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:47.680]  that that's old we already know that trust me if you know this is trust me we know about that
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:55.280]  why okay but guess what i'm gawzy i don't care about them been gawzy because when bush been
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:16:00.880]  gawzy little little bush one of his things that he does to cut a cost was to cut a lot and they call
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:05.200]  him a member of the bush family a lot of our um overseas she calls him her brother one of the
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:10.480]  areas that was felt was been gawzy so probably hadn't been gawzy we're his bush too buddy enough guards
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:15.280]  there to defend that area and stuff that's the reason why there was a lot of deaths in Benghazi
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:19.200]  so let's see if we get that straight so we're not finding the rebels since you have this going on
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:24.320]  we're not finding the rebels so anyone else you want to ask me yeah i do alex do you have any
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:30.080]  other questions for him well i mean hillary funded the radical islamist in the state department
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:36.800]  in syria what do you think about russia standing up against that so hillary funded the syrian
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:44.160]  modern rebels how do you feel about russia stepping in and bombing isis russia actually make a lot of
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:50.480]  money off of the president of syria i'm talking trillions of dollars trillions bombing he's really
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:55.360]  bombing all the people over there they're actually going against that president not really the syrian
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:59.440]  i mean the syrian what's it called isis or any of them and stuff that's really the truth of it all
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:07.280]  also in iraq uh what do you call it um president putin also sold a lot of stuff to the iraqis such
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:15.200]  as um night vision goggles and other stuff like that so if you're four these guys so you know
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:20.480]  bombing over there in syria you're for a guy that was bombing those kind of veterans over there
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:26.160]  that were helping now the west star there in iraq then you should know and that's pretty messed up
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:29.920]  they all right so you the russians didn't give anything to the iraq opposition i don't support
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:35.440]  our country supply from the us and iraq i mean and the russia everything so we don't we don't
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:39.120]  want to play we've never supplied weapons i i'll tell you who we're supplying to we're supplying to
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:43.520]  the witty cult of people over there we're the moderate rebels that's just another name al nazar is
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:48.400]  al qaeda it's a political name it's just like when you say when a when a president says you
[02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:52.480]  support our troops they don't mean to you support our troops what they mean is do you support our
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:57.840]  policies it's it's a mind trick it's propaganda to trick you the viewer who just watches and believes
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:02.080]  everything on tv to go along with it so that way it guilt trips you to say yeah i'm for the troops
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:06.640]  i'm not against them obviously but what you said yes to is actually the policies of going over and
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:10.880]  bombing bombing countries going into countries we don't belong in playing team of american
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:15.760]  world police what do you think hillary clinton's gonna do she used to be an anti-war war hippie
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:19.280]  and now she's one of the biggest war mongrel she attacks syria okay well you brought some really
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:24.400]  great points i really appreciate that stuff let's go down what you guess for me number one
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:29.760]  um before i talk about warmongering let's look at one of our last we call it uh vice president's
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:33.920]  chain who's one of the biggest war monitors oh we don't like i don't like him either i hate him so
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:37.680]  that's that's warmongers you know you should really look for those kind of people the most
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:41.440]  interesting lesson oh i don't have to worry about them now i'm worrying about the next president
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:45.760]  who's gonna run my country into the ground the last guy's been screwed up every promise he said
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:49.120]  we're gonna close down go on time we're gonna pull everybody out of afghanistan guess what
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:52.480]  we're leaving five thousand five hundred more troops that's what obama's doing he hasn't done
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:56.880]  one thing he said i don't want another pro obama because guess what hillary clinton's gonna be
[02:18:56.880 --> 02:19:01.200]  another obama and she's another clinton we don't need that well when you have a republican we
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:07.360]  call it party uh uh president saying that his whole big thing idea is he just thinks we're
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:13.600]  republicans he just identifies with him and not well i'm just saying you know and we're against
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:17.920]  the establishment candidates helping the middle class and stuff like that for those eight years
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:22.560]  unfortunately obama's has such a hard time this guy's we've heard all the democratic talking

[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:45.360]  that's of the venereal diseases are like the aids you know and whereas republicans are more
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:50.000]  like gonorrhea at this point and i hate to use gross analogies like that but they're going for
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:55.360]  broke here uh and uh joe biggs they have left you alone with your hillary for prison shirt that's
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:59.200]  good you're not stirring up any trouble you're just there doing interviews so i'm glad that
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.800]  that the san Antonio folks are not acting uh like you know to police state any other observations
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:12.640]  joe biggs well actually most of them the actual local police are looking at me smiling are agreeing
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:16.000]  with my shirt every now and then you'll seem to kind of look over a knot and uh you'll see
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.160]  like a smirk happen or whatever but they're trying to be professional in that show any kind of
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:25.360]  political side or favoring whatsoever but obviously people out here screaming hillary for prison
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:30.320]  you know go to jail for war crimes now you have people over here screaming that hillary needs to
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:36.000]  go to the white house like i said a train full of idiots wreck flipped over and it all poured out
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:41.440]  here into this area and it's just a whole nother world what did you think of that guys canned
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:46.880]  responses he wasn't listening to anything he just likes hillary even though he doesn't like her
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:52.800]  policies he just supports her mindlessly that's how most of the people are here i mean that's how
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:56.880]  most of the people who are going to vote for hillary clinton are they're mindless they have no idea
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:01.680]  they don't really look at the facts they don't actually go in they're this is a whole country
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:06.080]  that's just obsessed with being progressive and trendy and cool you know we just had the last guy
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:11.040]  who was black the first so now automatically have to have the first female president and it's not
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:16.160]  we're misogynist we're we're sexist and racist you know and it's that whole same thing that they
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:21.280]  keep serving to us every day you know biggs who are you really liking i mean obviously i like what
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:26.480]  trump says i like the fact he's aggressive i don't know about trust his history but now they're moving
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:31.120]  to basically go after ram poll and ron poll in guiding their former chief of staff for nothing
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:36.480]  literally nothing i mean this is getting this is getting creepy well it shows you they're scared
[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:40.720]  of you know the polls obviously i mean these are people who go out and speak the truth you know
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:44.560]  there are some things that ran paul does that i quite you know i don't really agree with but
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:49.440]  there's more things that he does do that i do go with you know what donald trump like he said before
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:54.160]  he says a lot of great things but at the same time he doesn't offer a lot of solutions it's still
[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:58.000]  early in the race i'm still hoping for him to come out and kind of give me some solutions to these
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.480]  problems if we bring it to the table you know building a wall simply will not fix this immigration
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:06.160]  problem we've been to the border before we've shown how wide open it is and even if there is a
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:11.520]  fence there in places in arizona or mecca or uh texas to have fences people say that get over it
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:15.280]  they go under it they figure out a way they pay somebody they get stuck in the back of a trunk
[02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:19.280]  we need to do something more than just building a wall and that's just going to be a big waste of
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:23.440]  money but you know like i said it's early he's got time to come out with some other things
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:27.440]  you know i think uh web on the democrat side really doesn't fit over there i think he should
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:32.880]  have been in the gop race he doesn't really seem to have the uh the equalities of the other candidates
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:38.000]  that were running for the uh you know democratic contenders so who knows like i said it's still
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.240]  early we'll see what happens but at this point in time what i do know 100% is that this woman
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:49.680]  does not belong in there she does not belong in the white house she does not belong as our president
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:55.680]  it's disgusting to see this many people show up in support of this woman knowing that she's going
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:28:01.120]  into this with so many lies on the table you know if you're going to run for an important
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:06.160]  position such as the president of the united states and you've already got this many scandals
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:10.880]  going on before it even happens and yet people are still voting for you that just shows how doomed
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:18.240]  we are well i agree and i just can't believe that she's gotten away with so much i mean i can't
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:23.760]  really think of anybody more corrupt than hillary clinton and you know she's under a rock like like
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:29.760]  like bush or something it'd be one thing but she just hangs around forever they've been on air i mean
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:36.320]  they've been in politics since i was a little kid and i've been on air 20 years having to cover
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:42.480]  hillary clinton and i am so sick of her i mean it's like it's a bad movie that i'm sick of looking at
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:49.280]  it's like groundhog day joe exactly i remember when uh bill first started running i was very young
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:54.240]  i remember that happening and my teacher asked me why don't you like bill clinton and i just said
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:59.600]  some you know childish answer at the time but you know it turned out to be right you know these guys
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:04.480]  have a bad history and they're going to continue and the biggest thing is whatever you run into
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:10.000]  feminist and they say they're pro women they're pro empowerment and all this and that but they never
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.240]  really look at the fact that the clinton's take money from these different countries that simply
[02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:18.480]  treat women like garbage so how can you say that you're for women and then you allow that to happen
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:22.720]  or say that you want to empower women to do the right thing but then you sit there and cover up
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:27.280]  for your your husband who's uh you know having affairs and you know you're having this bad
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:31.440]  absolutely joe that doesn't show empowerment keep reporting great job we'll have more your

[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:29.520]  you really take a deep breath and go my gosh it really is that bad the government has been hijacked
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:34.160]  by foreign banks they brag about this at davos they brag about it uh you know in official
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:39.760]  un documents that we've covered they're flooding the less with open borders they're destabilizing
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:45.600]  they're taking a lot of problems the societal breakdown showing some bad cops projecting it on
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:51.040]  to police in general to create a revolution against the police that the feds will guide
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:56.080]  and control that will then be used to federalize the police and then that's an admitted strategy
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:00.240]  by elsharpton i talked about it years ago but he's gotten up on tv we've played the clips
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:05.680]  and just admitted it george soros admits that he's done this in other countries too like ukraine
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:13.920]  so we're in a very dangerous situation and they're moving and dr paul craig roberts
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:17.520]  former top regan administration official wall street journal editor
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:23.200]  concurred that yes they're going to a new level of persecution a whistleblower's journalist
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:30.000]  they are moving to go after the polls they've indicted uh their chief of staff at number two
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:41.840]  person for giving money to a political candidate which they then claim endorsed ran poll well
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:47.840]  they run political campaigns they they fund libertarians they raise the money this is how
[02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:54.000]  they've written the laws where the feds can interpret it if you stick a stamp on sideways
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:59.280]  wire fraud i'm not people have been indicted for that so that's why when i ran for office for
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:03.120]  like a week i started talking to lawyers and looking around for state rep sort of looking at the
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:09.600]  look it was like they'll just put me in jail there's no way to follow this so that's where
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:15.760]  all this is going and then when in governments in history when when when governments create
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:22.320]  new police units and put their political officers over them that's because they know there's
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:27.680]  different camps in the fbi different camps in the federal marshals different camps in the commerce
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:38.400]  department different camps in the sec ftc and they can't get those units to go and frame
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:44.320]  ron paul ran paul alex jones matt drudge joseph era i mean these are people that are being targeted
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:50.240]  um governor abbott the his attorney general has been indicted i told you about that before it happened
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:57.040]  and i happen to know that the governor is honorable and and is doing this because he cares about
[02:42:57.040 --> 02:43:01.040]  texas in the country i have to know ron paul these people don't want to go up against these criminals
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:10.880]  but they're men they love their families and they just will not bow to this evil and they hope there's
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:15.440]  enough political pressure as they get indicted that people understand that this is like nazi
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:21.040]  germany when hitler started arresting people in 36 37 38 then they start wars look what they're doing
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:27.120]  with russia look how they're funding al qaeda and isis and so they brought in and this is all on the
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:32.800]  just department website the southern prairie law center the adl was an hour and a half c span video
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:36.480]  of this we're gonna play some clips right now we'll have more tomorrow there's so much of it
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:45.040]  and we just had an article just go up doj official praises southern prairie law centers work and
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:51.520]  combating domestic terrorism splc says it has places groups including conservative christian
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:57.760]  groups on its hate list based on their beliefs that's actually a cns news report so we've been
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:03.360]  covering this and now that now some folks are actually covering it but they say that they get
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:10.000]  their directives from the un obama administration and un announced global police force to fight
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:18.240]  extremism in us and then that that was two weeks ago this is today just department creates domestic
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:26.320]  terrorism unit outside of the fbi to liaise on directly with your local police departments and
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:32.880]  then they're directed by the southern prairie law center in adl who put out literature to police
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:38.800]  departments saying if someone hasn't get us out of the un sticker on their car go ahead and arrest
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:46.400]  them chances are they're a terrorist that's a quote and they're arresting people for rebel flags in
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:52.400]  georgia and charging them with terrorism saying the rebel flag hurt someone's feelings i mean
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:59.440]  this is this this is this is nazi germany this is soviet russia level stuff the question is
[02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:07.280]  are they going to roll it out big time so it's federalization of police it's globalization of
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:13.600]  police it's new special units that are purely political it will accompany false flags to demonize
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:18.960]  us it's it's very dangerous now i've got five clips here it'll take at least five minutes the next
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:24.160]  hour to get to all this when i hand the baton to rob do but let's go to the homegrown extremist part
[02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:30.560]  this is at george washington university named after the founder who they say associated press you
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:36.000]  can pull this up founding fathers wouldn't be included in today's military and george washington
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:41.120]  would be seen as an extremist today and was a bad person so they're at the university
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:47.520]  they want to take down george washington statues that's been called for they hate the american flag
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:54.720]  as well these are extreme radicals and they now run the show and they're now going to be in all
[02:45:54.720 --> 02:46:00.560]  your local departments persecuting police that don't get on board with us i mean this is really
[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:07.200]  this is a takeover i just got chills and again it's not things can happen next week or next month
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:13.920]  it's just the rollout is intensify the good news is these people have been exposed so they're
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:18.880]  cornered rats they're going for everything with hail marys but they got a chance to catch the
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:25.760]  ball in the end zone i mean they could win this is like sudden death over time nfl folks i mean
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:30.800]  this this we're in the fight but man we are in a fight let's go ahead and go to the homegrown
[02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:34.960]  extremist and again joe biden's been at these meetings it's got the attorney general there
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:39.120]  there and it's truly sickening how they mix islamic terror that they're funding
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:44.640]  in with patriot groups here it is so while we address that evolving international threat
[02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:48.800]  of violent extremism john carlin we have not and cannot lose sight of the domestic terrorism
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:54.320]  threats this is the general violent extremists terror and extremism do not always originate
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:59.600]  elsewhere or take place outside our borders homegrown violent extremists instead can be
[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:06.560]  motivated by any viewpoint on a full spectrum of hate anti-government views racism bigotry
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:12.720]  anarchy and other despicable beliefs when it comes to hate and intolerance there's no single
[02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:19.760]  ideology that governs now in america harboring extremist views is not itself a crime nor should
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:25.360]  it be oh really and it is not the expression of a hateful ideology or association with a particular
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:31.840]  hateful group what we do focus on is that line between speech and violence and it's crossed
[02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:37.840]  too often and it results in heartbreaking tragedy the list includes plots and attacks on government
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:44.000]  buildings businesses synagogues mosques and other public infrastructure it includes assassinations
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:50.400]  planned assassinations of police officers judges civil rights figures doctors and others it includes
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:55.920]  the stockpiling of illegal weapons explosives and biological and chemical weapons and killing
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:01.920]  sprees that have terrorized local communities looking back over the past few years it is quite
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:06.240]  clear that domestic terrorists and homegrown violent extremists remain a clear and present
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:12.240]  danger here inside the united states and as i said we recognize that according to at least one
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:16.720]  study more people have died in this country in attacks by domestic extremists than in attacks
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:23.200]  associated with international terrorist groups over the last say five or six years as our southern
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:28.000]  poverty law center colleagues can attest racial hatred motivates many of these violent extremist
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:34.000]  attacks and the attorney general noted this summer that these kinds of hate crimes are the original
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:40.880]  domestic terrorism among domestic extremist movements inside the united states the white
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:46.160]  supremacists are among the most violent the charleston's shooter who had a manifesto laying
[02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:51.600]  out a racist worldview is just one example his actions followed deadly shooting sprees by white
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:59.040]  supremacists in kansas wisconsin and elsewhere talked about the case of kevin uh apart from
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:06.160]  and one where it was successfully disrupted but we're not always so fortunate and in august 2012
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:12.320]  wade michael page who also espoused white supremacist in neo-nazi views fatally shot six people
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:18.400]  and wounded four others including a responding police officer at a seek temple in wisconsin
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:23.600]  he acted alone and he died in the course of the attacks with a self-inflicted gunshot wound
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:29.840]  we also see anti-government views triggering violence throughout america uh it's just one
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:35.600]  example three militia members right there sentenced notice they're getting trying to talk
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:39.120]  white supremacists that are almost completely federal run mentally ill people they wind up
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:46.880]  up too hateful rhetoric to speech in america so see that's where they're going with all this
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:51.920]  and arresting people that have rebel flags at parks and charging them with terrorism let's go back
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:58.480]  georgia for conspiring to use weapons of mass destructions in attacks against federal government
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:05.200]  buildings they attempted to acquire explosives in early 2014 with the goal of destroying us
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:09.520]  government infrastructure as part of a guerrilla warfare strategy to undermine the government
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:15.520]  of the united states and more broadly law enforcement agencies across the nation are
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:21.120]  concerned about the growth of the sovereign citizen movement according to one 2014 study
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:28.160]  state local and tribal local law enforcement officials considered sovereign citizens to
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:34.240]  be their top concern and it ranked above isle or al qaeda inspired extremists and that's
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:38.080]  consistent with the conversations i've had with police departments across the country both in
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:43.920]  my time here and when i was at the fbi these adherents to the so-called sovereign citizen
[02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:48.320]  ideology believe they don't have to answer any government authority including courts taxing
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:55.040]  entities or law enforcement and although most sovereign citizens espouse these views lawfully
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:58.080]  as they are entitled to do some resort to violence
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:05.520]  what would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality feeling better than

[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:17.440]  is up there announcing who the big enemy is and he basically spends 10 seconds on radical
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:21.440]  Islamists without even naming them and then just moves on to the sovereign citizens movement
[02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:27.680]  that probably does kill about two cops a year i've seen the numbers and they just that's all
[02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:30.880]  they show police and training videos into the world oh they're going to kill you any minute
[02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:37.520]  and then meanwhile this is the very justice department trying to federalize the police
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:42.640]  and has been caught running all the trayvon martin stuff stirring everything up on record
[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:48.080]  and funding radical Islamists to kill hundreds of thousands overseas that's how radical this
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:52.000]  this criminal government is so let's go back to him talking about sovereign citizens and he
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:58.640]  announces the domestic terrorism initiative here it is broadly law enforcement agencies across the
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:03.520]  nation are concerned about the growth of the sovereign citizen movement according to one
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:10.480]  2014 study i mean can't they just be sovereign like the legal and tribal law enforcement officials
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:16.320]  considered sovereign citizens to be their top concern and it ranked above isle or al qaeda
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:21.360]  inspired extremists and that's consistent without a bunch of attacks recruiting centers
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:25.840]  shootings this year they'll never say it's a radical muslim because that's controlled media
[02:55:26.880 --> 02:55:32.000]  and you just heard ranking number one is the sovereign citizens and that's just people that
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:35.200]  are don't have any more money they're out on a piece of property just hanging on they're not
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:39.840]  homeless yet this guy wants to make them homeless they're better clangers they're veterans he hates
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:46.640]  their guts and so it's the number one threat is the patriots that's because they segue from sovereign
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:51.680]  citizen into anybody that's for guns anything here let's go back to it as i've had with police
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:56.320]  departments across the country both in my time here and when i was at the fb i but the illegals
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:00.240]  don't follow either right here into the so-called sovereign citizen ideology believe they don't
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:05.200]  have to answer in any government authority including no unconstitutional authority are there
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:09.840]  some quacks out there that go too far yes most of them just know what they're talking about and
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:13.840]  are fed up and they know the illegals are above the law so they're not going to follow any of it
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:19.600]  so you ignore all the laws with the illegals bring them in have the justice department complete
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:25.040]  the smuggling process engage in all this racketeering and then they got eddie haskell up here
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:32.880]  so he's 12 years old i mean you people don't follow the law here here's obama right here
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:39.600]  here in the washington post obama ways executive action on guns circumventing congress october 8
[02:56:39.600 --> 02:56:44.080]  what's that called not believing in the law people are a sick joke let's go back to it
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:51.040]  taxing entities or law enforcement and although most sovereign citizens espouse going to use
[02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:55.040]  lawfully as they are entitled to do some resort to violence
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:57:02.720]  terry nickles uh the convicted accomplice in the oklahoma city bombing is believed by many
[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:07.920]  i mean you understand the former attorney general was the deputy attorney general his position before
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:12.720]  literally the emails came out in the lawsuit saying this is a d-day level event we've got
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:18.000]  to put everything on it to cover up what's happening and that the cover up he talks about
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:26.480]  the emails was his people there with our eyewitnesses loading the bombs and so they can now point
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:31.840]  it out and say we blew up oklahoma city remember rush limbaugh within 30 minutes bill clinton said
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:35.920]  it was talk radio's fault that they can take him down they can take everybody else down
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:42.320]  you understand i folks i know these people's mo i know how they operate i know what they're
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:47.360]  going to do and we're watching you and we're not afraid go ahead and finish up with this guy
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:54.080]  for the sovereign citizen movement and in 2010 joseph and jerry cane a father and son who identified
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:59.040]  with the sovereign citizen movement killed two police officers and then themselves were killed
[02:57:59.040 --> 02:58:05.760]  in an ensuing shootout with police after a routine traffic stop and in june 2014 drud and
[02:58:05.760 --> 02:58:11.120]  namanda miller likely motivated by the sovereign anti-signal they were crazy drugheads killed two
[02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:16.240]  los vegas metropolitan police department about three years last week especially got they then went to a
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:21.360]  nearby walmart and killed another innocent person and during their attacks they declared the beginning
[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:26.880]  of a so-called revolution so these attacks and other by the way they were death heads into the
[02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:33.280]  occult into satanism into just being radical and you blame us again for that i was blamed they said i

[03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:24.480]  not just arming the epa and the fda with machine guns and armored vehicles and billions of bullets
[03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:28.240]  and power grabbing land everywhere and just running around foaming at the mouth of the
[03:00:28.240 --> 03:00:34.480]  borders open shutting off our power plants like a pack of 10 million demonic pink gremlins
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:40.640]  you know wrecking our infrastructure couldn't couldn't do more kyjus you know out of pacific
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:46.640]  rim are less destructive than these real life destroyers of civilization these these these
[03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:51.760]  miscreants and now they have the announcement of their new domestic terrorism initiative
[03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:54.800]  if you read all the literature run by the southern poverty law center basically
[03:00:56.800 --> 03:01:02.480]  80 else in there but not the splc is the big dog it's such a great job at elheim city
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:09.760]  so let's go ahead and go back a domestic terrorism initiative here is this announcement
[03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:17.520]  this is a threat that requires as much as any other if not more not just a federal response
[03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:22.560]  but working closely with police officers district attorneys local community officials
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:29.120]  and members of the community who are eyes on the ground had nsd in order to ensure that we gain
[03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:34.400]  the benefits of the information and input coming in from all those different eyes on the federalization
[03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:40.720]  you know and in recognition of the growing number of domestic terrorism matters across the country
[03:01:40.720 --> 03:01:47.600]  and across across all of the united states we've created a new position to assist in our important
[03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:54.000]  work in combating domestic terrorism so just this week i've pointed a new domestic terrorism
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:59.440]  council to serve as our main point of contact for us attorneys working on domestic terrorism
[03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:05.840]  matters the new domestic terrorism council will not only help ensure that domestic terrorism cases
[03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:11.520]  are properly coordinated but will play a key role in our headquarters level efforts to identify
[03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:17.920]  translated to help shape our national strategy and to analyze legal gaps for enhancements required
[03:02:17.920 --> 03:02:23.440]  to ensure that we can combat these threats the new council will also play an important role in
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:29.680]  plugging into the domestic terrorism executive council by providing its members with overviews
[03:02:29.680 --> 03:02:35.120]  of cases and trends from around the country to provide a direction to that group that's enemies
[03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:40.800]  list persecution our collective objective is to disrupt and prevent terrorist attacks to stop
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:45.440]  the states from saving the country not a prosecution although they are sometimes necessary
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:50.800]  it's that we see the attack prevented the life save the injury that never they'll stop some
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:55.360]  fake attacks with mentally ill people and they'll carry out their own tools at our disposal and we
[03:02:55.360 --> 03:03:01.680]  need to do so aware that perhaps more so than any other area in which we operate we need to be mindful
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:06.000]  of the importance of people's civil rights and civil liberties and our fundamental values we do
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:11.760]  not investigate people for exercising their first amendment right sure but we are obligated to
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:16.400]  investigate extremist groups and individuals when they have when we have reason to believe that
[03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:21.120]  they're involved in the commission of a federal crime including crimes of violence and Santa Claus
[03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:26.960]  is real we need to utilize proactive enforcement tools and investigative techniques including
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:33.040]  undercover operations the use of confidential informants and other statutory authorities
[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:39.840]  all these crazy power tripping anti-americans oh i'm gonna throw up i tell you let's let's go out
[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:43.440]  to break with one more clip the threat of influence of internet here it is play that
[03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:48.880]  well we can only track threats that we can see with the explosive use of social media and encrypted
[03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:54.240]  communications those inspired to violence by messages of hate we run the risk that we will
[03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:59.920]  see less just as the bad guys are seeing more they call free speech messages social media in this
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:06.400]  space can also create for an extreme segment of our society a sort of radicalization echo chamber
[03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:12.640]  which each of their own calls for extremist propaganda or violence echo and support being
[03:04:12.640 --> 03:04:18.080]  done by posters that's a phenomenon in particular southern poverty law center has analyzed closely
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:24.480]  oh he analyzed it closely let me tell you analyzing the same oh he said so as service providers to
[03:04:24.480 --> 03:04:29.440]  provide a service that does so much good and has so many legitimate uh business entertainment purposes
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:34.880]  and is the way uh most of our children now are communicating and playing day to day just as it
[03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:40.640]  provides those good things they also need to take responsibility for how their services can be abused
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:45.360]  yeah so you'll censor like suckerbars doing to understand what the threats are this guy's the
[03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:50.000]  perfect sociopath globalist just real non-threatening oh hi i'm not a little suit

[03:05:04.880 --> 03:05:10.880]  management is ignoring the real estate title given by the state of texas 74 years ago to a farmer
[03:05:10.880 --> 03:05:15.600]  now the same bureaucracy that has ignored property rights for ranchers like clavin bundy and nevada
[03:05:15.600 --> 03:05:20.720]  ignored property rights for minors in oregon and elsewhere is coming after the property of a texas
[03:05:20.720 --> 03:05:26.640]  farmer the blm has decided they will move the boundary take half his land and his house congress has
[03:05:26.640 --> 03:05:31.280]  allowed bureaucracies to grow unchecked because congress doesn't like to pass laws they have
[03:05:31.280 --> 03:05:36.480]  abdicated their constitutional duty to bureaucracies who not only write the law but often act as their
[03:05:36.480 --> 03:05:41.440]  own police force and run their own court no one in either party in washington wants to change it
[03:05:42.080 --> 03:05:46.640]  these bureaucracies will destroy every last remnant of your god given constitutionally

[03:08:08.400 --> 03:08:17.200]  it is key to understand but the globalists are waging war to take over the west by opening
[03:08:17.200 --> 03:08:24.000]  up the borders bringing in masses of immigrants and then filling those immigrants full of hate
[03:08:24.560 --> 03:08:29.840]  of the people that are already in the country and that they're not getting enough and we've got
[03:08:29.840 --> 03:08:35.760]  mainstream news articles today here's rt associated press you name it german parents

[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:38.400]  break greece the more they bankrupt it the more they get reward it's all about hard core in your
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:46.720]  face cnn says ban the term he and she it's the new inward they actually say that that's on info wars.com
[03:11:48.080 --> 03:11:54.320]  and they're never going to stop it's they're not going to stop they're not crazy it's psych warfare
[03:11:54.320 --> 03:12:01.760]  on record now you criticize all this the justice department's federalizing the local police and
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:07.200]  saying you're the number one threat we're going to surveil you we're going to watch you we're going
[03:12:07.200 --> 03:12:14.000]  to come after you then they go to the strong cities network this is from yesterday at the
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:18.400]  justice department there's almost no coverage of this we're getting articles right now and look
[03:12:18.400 --> 03:12:22.080]  i don't want to be the only ones reporting i'm reporting all this before we have articles out
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:29.200]  hoping other people pick up on it and i'm doing the analysis for people that's why msnbc hates me
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:33.920]  so much i'm not bragging i've studied this though they go look at congress chairman of committees
[03:12:33.920 --> 03:12:38.800]  get their talking points from alex jones and that's true they're not talking points i've
[03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:43.760]  done the homework i've done the interviews thousands of them i've been there i've studied it i know
[03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:49.520]  their plan and i'm not sitting on it like i've got a golden egg it's a hand grenade i'm saying we
[03:12:49.520 --> 03:12:57.120]  need everybody to realize how diabolical premeditated and evil this is and they want tyranny to get
[03:12:57.120 --> 03:13:01.840]  rid of the free market and make us poor even if you're cynical and don't care about freedom
[03:13:01.840 --> 03:13:04.320]  this is going to hurt your bottom line this is bad
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:12.560]  so here they are the strong cities network which is a un initiative through the justice
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:19.440]  department federalizing police setting up spies funding leftist groups and putting people on the
[03:13:19.440 --> 03:13:23.680]  police review boards and you're like well there's some bad cops there's but yeah that's federal
[03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:33.920]  training that's globalism but you don't fix it by putting satan over it this is u n notice the
[03:13:33.920 --> 03:13:40.320]  u n sir like you your borders aren't open enough this is all global government tpp world treaty here
[03:13:40.320 --> 03:13:46.720]  it is the attorney general uh when she was out attending the united nations uh general assembly
[03:13:46.720 --> 03:13:53.120]  events hosted hosted her own launch of a strong cities network and that's the first ever network
[03:13:53.120 --> 03:13:58.640]  of city leaders around the world involved in building community for convincing states the
[03:13:58.640 --> 03:14:03.920]  network was created in recognition of the key role of local communities in combating violent
[03:14:03.920 --> 03:14:09.440]  extremism and back it up 10 seconds see this strategy is going on it's called unionization for
[03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:15.200]  over 60 years mainly in third world countries that are weak where they say imf world bank
[03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:17.920]  money will come in but you got to put the u n in charge of how it's distributed and they
[03:14:17.920 --> 03:14:23.120]  distribute it back to their own companies this is billions they're saying two billion the first
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:30.560]  year on this in the us alone to fly everybody around to un meetings steak dinners prostitutes
[03:14:30.560 --> 03:14:36.160]  you know all the regular stuff to corrupt them to get dirt on them to give them deals it's an
[03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:42.000]  intelligence operation and then bring them back and basically set them up in charge over the city
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:49.200]  and following you in edicts and that's what it's announced it's you in here it is the network was
[03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:55.200]  created in recognition of the key role of local communities in combating violent extremism and
[03:14:55.200 --> 03:15:00.880]  the need for more than a top-down approach instead from an approach that builds up from the communities
[03:15:02.400 --> 03:15:08.320]  see everything's inverse here he says oh this is bottom up no it's not it's international
[03:15:08.320 --> 03:15:12.720]  and then it's directed down to the bottom and circumvents the national and state government
[03:15:12.720 --> 03:15:18.080]  with the occupier traders sitting in their quarterbacking let's go back from the communities
[03:15:18.720 --> 03:15:24.000]  and it takes a page from our integrated strategy in combating other types of violent extremism
[03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:29.520]  we've long known i remember when i was doing violent crimes in the dc us attorney's offices
[03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:34.240]  that were most successful when we partner with and are out in the local communities
[03:15:34.240 --> 03:15:40.640]  part of life together to uphold the law community members are often best positioned to identify
[03:15:40.640 --> 03:15:45.360]  and relate to individuals who've begun on a path of violent extremism because they see things that
[03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:53.600]  we just don't see in law enforcement in the united states according to one study in 80 percent of the
[03:15:53.600 --> 03:16:01.120]  international terrorism uh inspired cases inside the united states there was a connection uh there
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:08.160]  was a third party bystander who was in a position to see the radicalization taking place but in
[03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:14.240]  over half of those cases that person who saw taking place did nothing to intervene if we could
[03:16:14.240 --> 03:16:20.080]  simply increase the number of those witnesses who take action to help us uh stop that path to
[03:16:20.080 --> 03:16:25.760]  radicalization i think we could reduce the number of lives lost terrorist attacks here oh that's good
[03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:30.080]  so somebody's saying is we're going to help with community people watching these are
[03:16:30.080 --> 03:16:35.440]  international spies in your town and then what they do is they radicalize leftist when we've gone
[03:16:35.440 --> 03:16:39.120]  to the police review board we know about the we've had our people in there that folks don't
[03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:42.400]  know what they look like videotaping this stuff three different meetings we're going to put a
[03:16:42.400 --> 03:16:47.680]  report out there's actual the majority are malice and Stalinist and then they've got all these young
[03:16:47.680 --> 03:16:51.840]  people they order to go out and then they show up at our pro-life demonstrations saying they love
[03:16:51.840 --> 03:16:56.080]  satan kill everybody and then they show up at other events saying kill the pigs and then they're
[03:16:56.080 --> 03:17:00.240]  putting they're getting ready to put more of these people on the new police review board
[03:17:01.520 --> 03:17:09.040]  or i live literal green i mean like translucent green skin you know scum
[03:17:10.960 --> 03:17:14.960]  i say green skin some people actually have like greenish white skin that's how evil they are
[03:17:14.960 --> 03:17:22.880]  they physically look like ghouls and they're showing up and we go to these events and they're
[03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:30.560]  getting orders from ut people and then they have un support i mean this is organized i just cannot
[03:17:30.560 --> 03:17:36.560]  believe that we are overrun by this much scum there's other clips definition of code book for
[03:17:36.560 --> 03:17:40.960]  domestic terrorism i'm going to get to this tomorrow i want to go to rob do is about to take over

[03:18:06.960 --> 03:18:12.000]  you or what dr robert said today is a brave man can only die once a coward dies a thousand deaths
[03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:16.880]  and as long as we stand up and fight yeah maybe they will kill us maybe something will happen but
[03:18:16.880 --> 03:18:21.680]  they can only do it once and and then whatever you've done is what you're going to leave behind so

[03:24:24.880 --> 03:24:31.120]  and i have a very special guest we're going to go to in one quick second uh she's a whistleblower
[03:24:31.120 --> 03:24:37.280]  from murk pharmaceuticals she used to work there selling vioxx she was a sales rep and now she's
[03:24:37.280 --> 03:24:42.800]  come out and i've got some i was talking to her in the hardings brandy vaughn and she said what do
[03:24:42.800 --> 03:24:46.800]  you want to cover i said well you know on monday i covered the vitamin k shot and how the pediatricians

[03:24:51.760 --> 03:24:55.520]  some images that you want to see that you want to see but first but right before we get to that i
[03:24:55.520 --> 03:24:59.680]  want to go over this article this is from the denver post fight brewing between feds
[03:24:59.680 --> 03:25:04.320]  and kombucha team makers now what does that have to do with vaccines well basically what's
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:10.480]  going on is the u.s alcohol tobacco um and firearms agents are are worried about how much
[03:25:10.480 --> 03:25:16.080]  alcohol is in kombucha and uh for years u.s alcohol tobacco tax and trade bureau have
[03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:20.000]  monitored kombucha makers nationwide for violations of federal alcohol rules a product
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:25.520]  with more than 0.5 alcohol by volume must be labeled as such and it's critical that customers
[03:25:25.520 --> 03:25:31.360]  have that information uh for health religious or some other reasons such as childhood consumption
[03:25:31.360 --> 03:25:39.040]  well let's look at the right here guys on the uh the insert for murk vitamin k shot oh it's got
[03:25:39.040 --> 03:25:44.640]  0.9 alcohol in it yet they want to inject that into little babies and there's not a big deal
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:50.880]  about it yet we've got a whole federal bureaucracy ready to go after people for making kombucha
[03:25:50.880 --> 03:25:54.960]  something that's really good for you and something that you should be drinking if you're not uh

[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:26.320]  actually coming up at the bottom of the hour so 800 259 9231 800 259 9231 vaccine questions only
[03:26:26.320 --> 03:26:32.880]  please uh nothing about pyramids or meteorites coming to hit us thank you um but getting into
[03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:38.640]  the vitamin k shot i i talked to you about that you said oh wait i've got two insert packages
[03:26:38.640 --> 03:26:43.280]  that show what what are what are we going to see here well i thought it was uh interesting that you
[03:26:43.280 --> 03:26:51.440]  brought that up because i was just sent uh this week some photos from a nurse who did some took
[03:26:51.440 --> 03:26:58.560]  photos of the actual box that the vitamin k shot comes in as well as the a different vial so there's
[03:26:58.560 --> 03:27:03.280]  there's two different makers um well i'm sure there's more than that but these are the two popular
[03:27:03.280 --> 03:27:09.600]  ones that they were giving in her hospital and um as you'll see one of the photos shows that it says
[03:27:09.600 --> 03:27:15.920]  contains no more than 100 or actually this is one this one says the active ingredient in it is
[03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:21.520]  polysorbate 80 right and that is linked to infertility strongly linked as well as to auto
[03:27:21.520 --> 03:27:25.920]  immune issues and all sorts of things and that's an additive they put in coloring as well it is
[03:27:25.920 --> 03:27:30.640]  and it's really bad for people it's in a lot of other vaccines as well it's not just the vitamin
[03:27:30.640 --> 03:27:35.920]  k shot but i have on tape my pediatrician telling me it's very safe the ingredients are no big deal
[03:27:35.920 --> 03:27:41.040]  it's got a little bit of alcohol in it for preservation and some castor oil and the vitamin k
[03:27:41.040 --> 03:27:46.000]  and that's about it but as you can see there that one's got polysorbate 80 now the other one is even
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:52.960]  worse yes and like you mentioned a lot of um a lot of doctors are telling um new mothers oh it's
[03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:59.600]  just vitamin k and saline it's very um you know it's very safe there's nothing dangerous in it
[03:27:59.600 --> 03:28:03.440]  and clearly either they're not telling the truth or they're not being told the truth
[03:28:04.080 --> 03:28:10.560]  so the second picture is actually the vial of the vitamin k shot and um as you can read on the side
[03:28:10.560 --> 03:28:18.960]  it says no more than 100 micrograms per liter of aluminum and this is a little aluminum for the
[03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:24.720]  newborn to help you think and process information better uh to help maybe with breastfeeding or
[03:28:24.720 --> 03:28:29.120]  something like that yes and then on top of that you've got the the mmr that they like to shoot
[03:28:29.120 --> 03:28:35.120]  into them and the second day that's actually the hep b vaccine and it has uh 250 micrograms of
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:40.880]  aluminum so babies newborn babies right out of the gate are getting 350 micrograms of aluminum
[03:28:40.880 --> 03:28:45.840]  and this is a toxin a known neurotoxin that should not be in our bodies in any amount right it's
[03:28:45.840 --> 03:28:50.720]  cause it's linked to breast cancer it's linked to Alzheimer's it's linked to a lot of neurological
[03:28:50.720 --> 03:28:55.920]  issues as well as gut issues because the brain and the gut are linked through the lymphatic system
[03:28:55.920 --> 03:29:01.600]  and this just does not belong in our babies there's no reason um that we should be shooting our
[03:29:01.600 --> 03:29:07.680]  babies unless you want to cause problems down the road which is what i firmly believe is what the
[03:29:07.680 --> 03:29:11.840]  what the purpose of all these vaccines in this many amounts over and over again especially
[03:29:11.840 --> 03:29:16.320]  in young babies is causing it's causing people to be lifelong patients of the pharmaceutical
[03:29:16.320 --> 03:29:21.040]  companies so they could help with ADHD asthma hey we got a pill for that we're ready to help you

[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:11.520]  really on the fight right now with this mandatory hpv vaccine tell us what's coming down the pipe
[03:35:11.520 --> 03:35:19.920]  with that. Yeah actually um the hpv vaccine Gardasil which is made by murk um it's pretty much
[03:35:19.920 --> 03:35:25.920]  the driving force behind the mandatory vaccine laws that we're seeing murk um we call it in the
[03:35:25.920 --> 03:35:32.160]  industry have to pay for vioxx vaccine and you know vioxx largest drug recall in the world
[03:35:32.960 --> 03:35:37.760]  happened before and now this is the recoup yeah it has to recoup some of those profits
[03:35:37.760 --> 03:35:44.400]  and they they um priced it at 135 a dose got the FDA to approve three doses within six months it has
[03:35:44.400 --> 03:35:50.480]  huge high high aluminum content like we were mentioning with vitamin k shot and they got it
[03:35:50.480 --> 03:35:56.240]  to approve for boys and girls nine to 26 so they're looking at tens of billions of dollars with this
[03:35:56.240 --> 03:36:02.080]  it's their new blockbuster um and that is really what's driving a lot of these mandatory vaccine
[03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:06.480]  laws and i don't know if you've seen the videos there's videos uh one that was out of uh i think
[03:36:06.480 --> 03:36:11.920]  it was columbia or venezuela and it was the room full of girls all convulsing at the same time and
[03:36:11.920 --> 03:36:15.360]  they'd just been given the shot the guys on video going we don't know what's going on they
[03:36:15.360 --> 03:36:19.920]  told us to do this we think there's something up please help us please help us these people are
[03:36:19.920 --> 03:36:24.880]  utterly just being devastated around the world it's not just in the united states this is worldwide
[03:36:24.880 --> 03:36:29.520]  that this stuff this is a bio weapon it seems like right japan has taken it um off of the
[03:36:29.520 --> 03:36:35.680]  recommended schedule the eu just um in september launched an investigation into the hpv vaccine
[03:36:35.680 --> 03:36:44.560]  after a great danish documentary came out exposing how many serious reactions are being um seen in
[03:36:44.560 --> 03:36:48.800]  populations of girls being given this vaccine and there are lawsuits all around the country
[03:36:48.800 --> 03:36:54.160]  against murk against the vaccine maker for injuries and deaths um related to garter cell
[03:36:54.160 --> 03:36:59.840]  and that's one important point here in the us um vaccines are you know completely protected but
[03:36:59.840 --> 03:37:04.320]  have complete liability protection from the federal government so those lawsuits that we're
[03:37:04.320 --> 03:37:08.960]  seeing around the world and the information that comes out in the discovery process of the judicial
[03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:13.920]  process we can't do that here in the us it's all hidden it's all hidden yeah and there's no liability
[03:37:13.920 --> 03:37:20.160]  which means that vaccine makers make far more profit off of vaccines than they do normal pharmaceutical
[03:37:20.160 --> 03:37:25.440]  drugs and they don't pay for any of these payouts it's all it all comes from the dose that you pay
[03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:30.480]  for when you get the vaccine a two dollars of that goes into this fund which is it's a huge slush
[03:37:30.480 --> 03:37:34.560]  fund but they paid out over three billion dollars already so it's not safe and effective like they
[03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:41.600]  keep telling us let's go to shane in north carolina shane what is on your mind yeah i just wanted to
[03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:47.360]  um share my story actually you if you were talking about the vitamin k shot and that's that's one of
[03:37:47.360 --> 03:37:52.960]  them that you you you sell them here people talk about my wife and i just first shot second yeah
[03:37:52.960 --> 03:38:00.240]  we had our second baby boy um about a month ago and he he arrived a week early my wife and i
[03:38:00.240 --> 03:38:06.800]  were already looking into taking the the vitamin k orally we knew that we were going to um refuse
[03:38:06.800 --> 03:38:13.760]  the uh happy but we thought we had a week to you know figure out which um vitamin k we were going
[03:38:13.760 --> 03:38:17.520]  to buy and all that and all of a sudden you know she went into labor and we all of a sudden we
[03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:24.160]  were in the hospital and having this baby a week earlier than planned so then you know these people
[03:38:24.160 --> 03:38:28.320]  are coming around me with their clipboards and everything talking about all you know like they
[03:38:28.320 --> 03:38:32.480]  do and i said yeah well we're not doing the hat b and then they're like well what about the vitamin
[03:38:32.480 --> 03:38:39.440]  k i'm like well we were going to do uh do that orally um but you know we we thought the baby
[03:38:39.440 --> 03:38:44.240]  was coming a week later so we we didn't really make a decision so i guess we'll just hold off on that
[03:38:44.240 --> 03:38:50.160]  one too and then i mean they're like whispering and you know acting like it's the biggest deal in
[03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:56.400]  the world like they were making a bigger deal about me not getting the vitamin k than they were
[03:38:56.400 --> 03:39:03.040]  about the hat b yeah they had my pediatrician call me and uh i mean my pediatrician called he was
[03:39:03.040 --> 03:39:07.200]  somehow affiliated with their hospital apparently but but he called and said yeah oh yeah you know
[03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:11.760]  we just want to uh we just kind of want to know why don't you want to get this vitamin k
[03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:16.400]  and like everyone was asking me and they try to scare you with you know the bleeding that could
[03:39:16.400 --> 03:39:20.480]  happen and everything else yeah they just they really put that scare tactic on you i've gone
[03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:25.520]  through it with four kids and every time it's a different tactic that they use this last time i
[03:39:25.520 --> 03:39:31.200]  said i'm just going to record what they say and then you know play it for the world to hear so they
[03:39:31.200 --> 03:39:37.840]  can build upon their uh you know cut cache of experience so did you end up doing it or what
[03:39:37.840 --> 03:39:43.840]  happened what was the final result first of all i wasn't prepared to deal with you know this this
[03:39:43.840 --> 03:39:52.080]  reaction from them i mean it freaked me out and then of course um i you know my wife is not quite
[03:39:52.080 --> 03:39:59.920]  quite where i'm at with all this stuff okay uh the vaccines and you know we um our first son
[03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:09.520]  has only had the detap against my will but my wife felt very strongly about it um so um she said well
[03:40:09.520 --> 03:40:14.720]  let's just get it you know we we have you know she got kind of scared into you know let's just
[03:40:14.720 --> 03:40:19.360]  you know get the the k vaccine and i was just like i don't know you know let's just wait i mean we
[03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:25.680]  i mean we can just get them some drops and i'll get them you know sent within the next day or two
[03:40:26.320 --> 03:40:31.360]  but they freaked out about it so then my pediatrician called and i said yeah we don't
[03:40:31.360 --> 03:40:37.520]  i don't feel comfortable injecting this into my baby and he said well uh you can you know technically
[03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:45.520]  take it orally so i ended up deciding to do that and i mean uh i kind of regret it hearing
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:50.400]  everything that you talked about you know being in in it but i suppose it's better to take it orally
[03:40:50.400 --> 03:40:57.280]  than to have that injected mainline into a newborn but that's what we ended up doing at the hospital
[03:40:57.280 --> 03:41:05.920]  is he took a certain amount of it orally amount that was recommended by the pediatrician right
[03:41:05.920 --> 03:41:10.160]  and it was and it was actually right from the vaccine yeah they just take it out and right
[03:41:10.160 --> 03:41:13.760]  they do that and because they don't really have anything on hand and that's what they try to say
[03:41:13.760 --> 03:41:17.360]  well we don't have that on hand we just have to give them the the regular one and then with with
[03:41:17.360 --> 03:41:21.760]  my case they wanted to give them more down the line and and we ended up going to a compounding
[03:41:21.760 --> 03:41:27.280]  pharmacy which are kind of rare i found out but they were able to make a really you know pure
[03:41:27.280 --> 03:41:32.720]  version of vitamin k for us without any preservatives or anything really really nice people at uh at
[03:41:32.720 --> 03:41:39.120]  people's pharmacy but um you know if i anything that yeah i had my son in in holland and granted it
[03:41:39.120 --> 03:41:45.200]  was a home birth but there was no talk about the vitamin k shot so this standard protocol that's
[03:41:45.200 --> 03:41:50.880]  going on here in the us outside in other countries this this is not the same it's not the same standard
[03:41:50.880 --> 03:41:55.920]  protocol i never heard about vitamin k we they didn't even talk to me about vaccines they said at
[03:41:55.920 --> 03:42:00.800]  his two month appointment with the midwives do you want to talk about vaccines some parents do i
[03:42:00.800 --> 03:42:06.240]  said why would i want you know to do that he's perfectly healthy yeah and she's like great
[03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:11.040]  because we don't want to talk about them either exactly because i think we have this idea that
[03:42:11.040 --> 03:42:16.640]  everywhere in the world does it just like the us and the in here in the us we do it far differently
[03:42:16.640 --> 03:42:20.960]  and these things that they try to push on us a standard protocol in the hospital and when we're
[03:42:20.960 --> 03:42:26.720]  giving um birth um and with our children with the whole vaccine program this is not how it's done
[03:42:26.720 --> 03:42:30.720]  in the rest of the world right we have we lead the world with our vaccine schedule and we lead
[03:42:30.720 --> 03:42:36.000]  the world with uh infant mortality and developing countries and developing countries to be fair
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:40.160]  and develop countries and develop countries yeah exactly i still think we are developing in some
[03:42:40.160 --> 03:42:46.160]  some ways mike in tennessee what is your question i just wanted to find out did you work at the
[03:42:46.160 --> 03:42:52.960]  facility in marietta georgia no i was a sales rep and i repped vioxx and that experience showed me
[03:42:52.960 --> 03:42:56.960]  that things that are on the market are not necessarily safe and there's a lot of corruption
[03:42:56.960 --> 03:43:01.920]  behind the scenes well if you ever have an opportunity i know someone personally that works
[03:43:01.920 --> 03:43:08.160]  there worked there for many many years and just walking through there and just looking at the
[03:43:08.160 --> 03:43:12.960]  procedures the way that this is done the way these things are manufactured uh you would
[03:43:12.960 --> 03:43:17.760]  want to think twice about putting any of that stuff in your body and of course as you touched on
[03:43:18.320 --> 03:43:23.760]  have your kids at home keep them there keep your money in your pocket uh don't submit to
[03:43:23.760 --> 03:43:28.880]  these authority i mean they're out of their mind sociopaths and anybody that would listen to them
[03:43:28.880 --> 03:43:35.120]  is just insane totally agree i mean bovine serum people even know what that is a diploid cells
[03:43:35.120 --> 03:43:39.680]  those are made out of aborted fetal cells dog kidney cells yeah that's the stuff that monkey
[03:43:39.680 --> 03:43:44.560]  kidney cells in the polio vaccine you know that's the stuff they inject people with and you don't
[03:43:44.560 --> 03:43:49.200]  know what that's doing on a dna level yeah it's damaging our dna and they're not doing those tests
[03:43:49.200 --> 03:43:52.880]  i guarantee you right they're not doing those tests they're going are you getting sick are you dying
[03:43:52.880 --> 03:43:56.880]  okay it's safe safe and effective let's get it out let's get it out there's no long-term safety
[03:43:56.880 --> 03:44:01.840]  studies right so and the fda often fast tracks them and a lot of people don't realize the safety
[03:44:01.840 --> 03:44:06.160]  studies that are done on vaccines they're not done with the proper placebo's that's very
[03:44:06.160 --> 03:44:11.920]  substandard um safety testing no long term no combination doses even though we give kids six
[03:44:11.920 --> 03:44:17.440]  to nine doses sometimes more at baby visits there's so much people aren't hearing behind the scenes
[03:44:17.440 --> 03:44:22.080]  the safety testing is not like even pharmaceutical drugs i mean pharmaceutical drugs slip through
[03:44:22.080 --> 03:44:26.880]  the cracks well vaccines slip through through far bigger cracks canyons they're slipping through can
[03:44:26.880 --> 03:44:32.160]  they're just wheeling them in going how many can we get exactly they've got 271 new vaccinations
[03:44:32.160 --> 03:44:36.400]  that they want to come out with right i mean that's ridiculous it's a totally untapped market for
[03:44:36.400 --> 03:44:40.320]  pharmaceutical companies like they're looking at a pharmaceutical drug market that's completely
[03:44:40.320 --> 03:44:45.680]  saturated a bunch of competition high hurdles the safety testing to get into the market and
[03:44:45.680 --> 03:44:49.440]  then vaccines i mean look at all these disease states that they could come up with vaccines
[03:44:49.440 --> 03:44:55.120]  or they're coming up with an anthrax vaccine cancer hiv an anti-government vaccine
[03:44:55.920 --> 03:45:01.760]  exactly i would never want these things put into my body dead or alive they don't belong in my body
[03:45:01.760 --> 03:45:06.880]  and they're they're they're coming and that's what people don't understand and it starts in
[03:45:06.880 --> 03:45:13.680]  california sp277 is their opening salvo and when it sticks there and people don't fight back it's
[03:45:13.680 --> 03:45:18.480]  going to continue to move it's going to go west it'll probably go from california all the way
[03:45:18.480 --> 03:45:23.520]  to massachusetts and rhodeland and those new england states and then it's going to make its way into
[03:45:23.520 --> 03:45:29.200]  the heartland i think texas might hold out a little bit but we'll see yeah we'll see thanks
[03:45:29.200 --> 03:45:37.360]  thanks for the call mike john what is your question yes brandy uh thank you for what you're doing
[03:45:37.360 --> 03:45:46.400]  it's uh wonderful to see someone that is exposing what's going on in this uh murk industry you said
[03:45:46.400 --> 03:45:55.280]  you were involved with biox yes yeah my uh they lost the lawsuit didn't they uh and um my sister who
[03:45:55.280 --> 03:46:01.520]  is a vaccine researcher in south carolina mary toko and she does have a website childhoodshots.com
[03:46:01.520 --> 03:46:06.640]  but she's been doing this for over 35 years she ran into an attorney there in south carolina that
[03:46:06.640 --> 03:46:12.880]  represented the defendants and um they he told her that they came out with the garter cell to pick up
[03:46:12.880 --> 03:46:19.840]  the extra money that they lost on the lawsuit and that's why it's being promoted from one standpoint
[03:46:19.840 --> 03:46:24.240]  but if you could ever get a hold of my sister she would probably be very happy to hear your
[03:46:24.240 --> 03:46:29.280]  information she's at childhoodshots.com and her name is mary toko great i've heard her name out
[03:46:29.280 --> 03:46:33.200]  there um i can't remember anything recently that i've seen from her but yeah i've seen her out
[03:46:33.200 --> 03:46:37.680]  there there's a lot of good people uh dr humphries susan humphries is out there fighting it uh sherry
[03:46:37.680 --> 03:46:42.240]  ten penny there's a lot of people really fighting this issue and and it's great to see people coming
[03:46:42.240 --> 03:46:47.120]  together more people like yourself speaking out against this so it's really uh given hope i think
[03:46:47.120 --> 03:46:51.760]  to parents because one thing the pediatrician said was it must be really scary being a parent
[03:46:51.760 --> 03:46:55.760]  now because there's so much information and the whole time she was saying that i was thinking
[03:46:55.760 --> 03:47:00.240]  she really means it's so hard and scary being a pediatrician because there's so much information
[03:47:00.240 --> 03:47:04.560]  that parents are arming themselves with and they're standing up and saying no to that regimented
[03:47:04.560 --> 03:47:10.160]  schedule of just injecting aluminum into your body and if you know go listen to dr blalock give a two
[03:47:10.160 --> 03:47:14.720]  hour speech on what aluminum does when it goes into your brain and all they do when they do these
[03:47:14.720 --> 03:47:18.800]  studies and correct me if i'm wrong they just test for antibodies they just go oh you got antibodies
[03:47:18.800 --> 03:47:24.480]  that means it works and what's going on is these adjuvants like aluminum and mercury are stimulating
[03:47:24.480 --> 03:47:27.840]  the brain and creating antibodies and they go oh well there there's your proof that it works
[03:47:27.840 --> 03:47:31.520]  there's your proof that it's safe and effective is that right is that how they do that yes and
[03:47:31.520 --> 03:47:35.200]  one thing that i think people aren't aware of is that in a natural environment we would never
[03:47:35.200 --> 03:47:40.320]  come into contact with six to nine pathogens at one time so when we're injecting this with the
[03:47:40.320 --> 03:47:45.280]  adjuvants which are heavy metals which are very toxic and hard to detox from as well as additives
[03:47:45.280 --> 03:47:53.200]  like formaldehyde and the monkey and the animal and human cells dna polysorbate 80 msg which we're
[03:47:53.200 --> 03:47:57.760]  supposed to avoid in chinese food right and mercury which we're supposed to avoid in fish but it's
[03:47:57.760 --> 03:48:01.600]  okay to inject in your veins to inject into the bloodstream where it goes straight to the vital
[03:48:01.600 --> 03:48:08.000]  organs um what we're seeing when you inject so many vaccine doses and so many pathogens with all
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:13.520]  of these adjuvants the body has no idea what's going on we're overwhelming the immune system
[03:48:13.520 --> 03:48:18.000]  and so this is where we're seeing all of these autoimmune issues the food allergies asthma eczema
[03:48:18.000 --> 03:48:23.840]  psoriasis lupus um all of these types of things because the body just starts fighting everything
[03:48:23.840 --> 03:48:28.880]  it starts attacking itself it attacks itself and it attacks things like peanut oil peanut
[03:48:28.880 --> 03:48:33.520]  allergies or because peanut oil is off the chart there's like five kids in my neighborhood who can't
[03:48:33.520 --> 03:48:37.040]  have peanut butter and if my kids eat peanut butter sandwiches they have to go outside it's
[03:48:37.040 --> 03:48:41.920]  ridiculous yes and these are things and people are accepting this as a new normal in the us
[03:48:41.920 --> 03:48:46.000]  when i had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches all the time when i was a child we all grew up on that
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:49.440]  wait a minute i think we're being racist now that's actually a racist term to say peanut
[03:48:49.440 --> 03:48:53.360]  butter and jelly sandwich so we gotta we gotta cut that line of conversation and go to our next
[03:48:53.360 --> 03:49:00.000]  caller mj in georgia wants to talk about the vitamin k shot what's on your mind mj uh just a
[03:49:00.000 --> 03:49:06.160]  few quick things um i've looked at quite a bit of your work brandy online and uh done some research
[03:49:06.160 --> 03:49:13.600]  myself but i'm actually assumed to be father and i was researching vitamin k myself and and
[03:49:13.600 --> 03:49:18.400]  benzene the benzene alcohol that's in there is actually a chemical that they put in ethanol
[03:49:18.400 --> 03:49:25.280]  so you can't drink it as moonshine and if you drink it it of course makes you sick um secondly i called
[03:49:25.280 --> 03:49:31.360]  the round doctors to one try to see if any type of drops were available but they make it unavailable
[03:49:31.360 --> 03:49:37.760]  to you but if you read the insert on the vaccine the vaccine says that if this intravenous shot can
[03:49:37.760 --> 03:49:42.560]  be avoided it should be avoided you know i mean because of the toxic levels of that i didn't know
[03:49:42.560 --> 03:49:50.400]  they had aluminum in it um i'm or i really want to avoid it but my my wife is on defense she's
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:55.520]  and they scare them they tell them that specifically dealing with like natural bursts and midwives
[03:49:55.520 --> 03:50:00.080]  they tell you it's a risk involved with the baby coming through the birth canal and there's pressure
[03:50:00.080 --> 03:50:05.200]  on his head and he could have internal bleeding and they really try to scare you into it and and
[03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:11.760]  one i was wondering if you know possibly brandy if you could talk to my fiance or we can you know
[03:50:11.760 --> 03:50:16.880]  have a conversation offline or something and maybe try to get this taken care of before it's too late
[03:50:16.880 --> 03:50:21.280]  honestly i really don't want to do it i'm trying to find the shot that drops but they make it
[03:50:21.280 --> 03:50:25.760]  virtually impossible to find the shots especially where i am here in georgia i haven't been able
[03:50:25.760 --> 03:50:31.360]  to find them yet i've been searching for about a week and i've been unsuccessful if any help from
[03:50:31.360 --> 03:50:35.440]  you guys would i would appreciate it well let me just say this brandy's not a doctor and she can't
[03:50:35.440 --> 03:50:39.840]  provide medical advice but we can sit here and bitch about these all day long do your own research
[03:50:39.840 --> 03:50:44.400]  i would say check out dr sherry tin penny online she's got some videos specifically about the vitamin
[03:50:44.400 --> 03:50:51.040]  k shot and i could tell you from my own experience my wife doubled and tripled up on kale kale has
[03:50:51.040 --> 03:50:56.160]  high amounts of vitamin k in it and that's what we did so take that for what it's worth we're
[03:50:56.160 --> 03:51:00.000]  going to be back with one more segment with brandy von whistleblower from mark stay tuned

[03:54:17.360 --> 03:54:22.080]  having a very lively conversation about vaccines i really get amped up about vaccines and i didn't
[03:54:22.080 --> 03:54:25.760]  know i was doing the show till i got here today and when i found out it was going to be talking to
[03:54:25.760 --> 03:54:30.240]  brandy who have watched her videos she's been attacked for come and speaking out especially
[03:54:30.240 --> 03:54:35.280]  with sb 277 we may have time to get into that or you'll cover it with leanne we do have we do have
[03:54:35.280 --> 03:54:40.080]  some more callers um so let's go to brenda who's a medical assistant wants to talk about vaccines
[03:54:40.080 --> 03:54:47.280]  calling from wisconsin hi how you doing doing great what's what's on your mind well um like 20
[03:54:47.280 --> 03:54:54.480]  years ago i was a i was a medical assistant for a holistic md mrcp in the lake caniva area
[03:54:54.480 --> 03:55:00.640]  and i learned a lot we used homeopathics and then i went back to school got my certification for
[03:55:00.640 --> 03:55:08.960]  medical assistant and uh worked in mainstream medicine well um you know it's ridiculous how
[03:55:08.960 --> 03:55:17.600]  many vaccines they give to babies you know a time and some you know sometimes they only
[03:55:18.560 --> 03:55:25.200]  were required to give out of vaccination information sheet right which is not the
[03:55:25.200 --> 03:55:30.160]  insert it's a it's an eight and a half by eleven piece of paper and it just says they're safe and
[03:55:30.160 --> 03:55:34.880]  effective and don't worry and if you notice anything let us know and maybe we'll deal with it right
[03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:38.800]  and we'll tell it we'll tell you it's a coincidence we'll tell you it's a coincidence and that's normal
[03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:42.480]  uh we've we had a guy in here uh marcos who's talking about he actually went on the air and
[03:55:42.480 --> 03:55:47.840]  talked about how his well i think his oldest girl got vaccine uh vaccinated and was crying
[03:55:47.840 --> 03:55:52.560]  constantly for 12 hours and i said oh that's normal that's normal no that's because of the brain
[03:55:52.560 --> 03:55:58.160]  swelling that is an attack procedures exactly exactly thanks for calling in brenda um we had
[03:55:58.160 --> 03:56:03.360]  somebody calling and said vaccines any good ones he's hung up now but um you were saying what what
[03:56:03.360 --> 03:56:08.000]  were you saying about vaccines are there any good ones or bad ones what what can we trust i think
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:14.080]  every parent should do the research because the children deserve it um my son is vax free
[03:56:14.080 --> 03:56:20.320]  and i don't feel that there are any that uh the the benefits outweigh the risk by far exactly my
[03:56:20.320 --> 03:56:26.640]  two youngest are completely vax free and my two oldest have very very small amounts that i was
[03:56:26.640 --> 03:56:30.560]  against the whole time but i had to fight the medical establishment and my wife but it can't
[03:56:30.560 --> 03:56:34.400]  be done we had a caller was talking about his wife you just got to do the research get the
[03:56:34.400 --> 03:56:38.400]  inserts you can look them up online all you got to do is type in the vaccine in the insert
[03:56:38.400 --> 03:56:43.040]  there's a whole page of them on on websites out there and you can read the actual insert that
[03:56:43.040 --> 03:56:47.440]  comes from the company and you could read about all the things they cause bill indiana uh you
[03:56:47.440 --> 03:56:51.280]  think charcoal is effective against the shots or are you calling to ask if charcoal is effective
[03:56:51.680 --> 03:56:57.040]  rob uh is charcoal effective if you have if you're in a corner and you have to take the
[03:56:57.040 --> 03:57:01.040]  shots would charcoal be an effective way to filter some of that poison out of your system
[03:57:01.680 --> 03:57:05.200]  it's probably better nothing but i don't know i mean they're injecting it into your body and not
[03:57:05.200 --> 03:57:09.680]  into your stomach that's that's the thing with charcoal is that you're ingesting it and what
[03:57:09.680 --> 03:57:14.160]  happens with vaccines is they go straight into your bloodstream and straight to your vital organs
[03:57:14.160 --> 03:57:19.120]  without going through the detox process through the kidney through the lungs or the skin um so
[03:57:19.120 --> 03:57:27.680]  it it it's probably better than nothing it is a detox um but how much how much help it is i guess
[03:57:27.680 --> 03:57:32.480]  it depends on the person and and yeah and you could find videos out there i think dr belaylock
[03:57:32.480 --> 03:57:36.240]  has one too if you have to take the shot this is what to do he mentioned some stuff and he's got
[03:57:36.240 --> 03:57:40.080]  some great information there's a lot of great information out there which is is is really
[03:57:40.080 --> 03:57:46.560]  awesome to see alex in virginia what is your question hey rob um i just wanted to make a couple
[03:57:46.560 --> 03:57:52.240]  comments my father-in-law uh as a construction worker and he was working at the mark facility
[03:57:52.240 --> 03:57:57.280]  here in virginia and he he would tell me stories about how it's like it's so toxic they have to
[03:57:57.280 --> 03:58:03.760]  wear these masks and stuff to be able to even go in there and work it's like so bad um and i was
[03:58:03.760 --> 03:58:08.320]  able to convince my sister-in-law not to get the hpv vaccine because of it because i was like come
[03:58:08.320 --> 03:58:12.320]  on you know your dad's they're inhaling these fumes they're putting it into a vaccine and you're
[03:58:12.320 --> 03:58:18.400]  getting an injected so yeah if you got to wear a spacesuit to go to the building i mean what do
