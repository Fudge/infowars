[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.340]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here on this Monday August 25th 2014
[00:29.340 --> 00:34.960]  well it's wars rumors of wars and earthquakes in the news and we've got a
[00:34.960 --> 00:39.800]  lot of important news coming up we've had just yesterday of course as you know by
[00:39.800 --> 00:43.760]  now there was a major earthquake in California what you may not know is that
[00:43.760 --> 00:48.120]  although that was a 6.1 magnitude earthquake there was an earthquake also
[00:48.120 --> 00:52.000]  in Peru that was kind of overlooked for the most part with all the news about
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.840]  California that one in Peru was 6.9 and of course at the time that all this was
[00:56.840 --> 01:01.440]  going on there was news that Iceland was concerned about a new volcanic
[01:01.440 --> 01:06.200]  eruption they were putting out warnings to airliners going in that area they had
[01:06.200 --> 01:11.480]  warned of a subglacial earthquake underneath this volcano then they have
[01:11.480 --> 01:16.560]  now taken that back yet there's a lot of activity a lot of increased earthquake
[01:16.560 --> 01:21.680]  seismic activity we talked just four months ago to Stan Dayo and we're going
[01:21.680 --> 01:25.120]  to have him back in the third hour we talked to him about the increase in
[01:25.120 --> 01:29.360]  earthquake activity seismic activity what in the world is going on well
[01:29.360 --> 01:32.960]  that's something that we should all be concerned about because in California you
[01:32.960 --> 01:37.160]  only got a 10 second warning if you were in that area about the earthquake coming
[01:37.160 --> 01:39.760]  and they were all talking about how amazing that was that they could predict
[01:39.760 --> 01:44.760]  it 10 seconds ahead of time well maybe you need to think about this a little
[01:44.760 --> 01:48.880]  bit longer than 10 seconds before and because you're not going to be able to
[01:48.880 --> 01:53.680]  do much other than try to duck and cover maybe you should start thinking about
[01:53.680 --> 01:58.640]  the possibility of this happening and make longer-term preparations in case
[01:58.640 --> 02:04.280]  we have not just an earthquake but any kind of natural disaster or man-made
[02:04.280 --> 02:08.040]  disaster or war whatever terrorist event that is going to essentially take
[02:08.040 --> 02:12.920]  down the grid and leave you without water without food maybe you need to start
[02:12.920 --> 02:15.960]  preparing maybe you need to think about what's happening and think about the
[02:15.960 --> 02:20.640]  changes that are going on also as far as the war goes we had just it was just a
[02:20.640 --> 02:24.560]  year ago that the US government was pushing for war in Syria now they're
[02:24.560 --> 02:30.480]  using it again on the other side with this new execution of the journalist the
[02:30.480 --> 02:36.160]  American journalist mr. Foley it has now come out over the weekend that experts
[02:36.160 --> 02:42.640]  in the UK believe that this beheading was perhaps a faked video they came down
[02:42.640 --> 02:45.600]  and said very clearly that this one group believes that it was fake so we're
[02:45.600 --> 02:49.520]  going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson who's who has a couple of articles up on
[02:49.520 --> 02:55.040]  info wars.com right now staged Foley beheading used as a poster child for
[02:55.040 --> 02:59.000]  the Syria attack is one of the articles the other one is experts say that the
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.600]  James Foley beheading video was likely a fake and so he's going to be joining us
[03:03.600 --> 03:09.240]  in this hour we're also going to have an interview with Alex Jones and Joe Rogan
[03:09.240 --> 03:12.440]  Alex Jones interviewed Joe Rogan that's going to be in the second hour you want
[03:12.440 --> 03:18.480]  to make sure you catch that a lot of news also about the border Obama of course
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.000]  is now talking yet again about an executive order for amnesty because
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.840]  Congress is out right now they're on vacation and you know they've tried over
[03:27.840 --> 03:31.680]  and over again he hasn't gotten exactly what he wanted from the legislature you
[03:31.680 --> 03:35.600]  know the democratic process just isn't working out for him with those elected
[03:35.600 --> 03:39.160]  representatives who are supposed to pass a law so if he doesn't get what he
[03:39.160 --> 03:44.680]  wants he's going to enact an executive order he's threatened and a lot of people
[03:44.680 --> 03:47.520]  believe that he's really going to make good on that threat it's kind of like
[03:47.520 --> 03:53.200]  what they did with the internet copyright laws of a syspa sopa acta pippa
[03:53.200 --> 03:57.360]  these things have been rejected by legislatures throughout America
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.920]  throughout Europe yet they keep coming back again and again and again now they
[04:01.920 --> 04:04.720]  get to the point where they're going to essentially put it in the back door
[04:04.720 --> 04:08.720]  through the Trans Pacific Partnership so you know they can they can rule by
[04:08.720 --> 04:13.640]  fiat a number of ways you can do it by executive order you can do it by
[04:13.640 --> 04:17.520]  regulation with a bureaucracy because they create these bureaucracies they give
[04:17.520 --> 04:21.560]  them legislative powers and they say where we're just making rules it was
[04:21.560 --> 04:26.640]  just a week ago that the National Highway Traffic Safety Association that
[04:26.640 --> 04:29.800]  bureaucracy said that they're going to come up with a new rule they don't call
[04:29.800 --> 04:34.080]  it a law but they call it a rule mandating vehicle to vehicle communication
[04:34.080 --> 04:37.920]  what's that about we'll talk about that as well so stay with us we're going to
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.640]  be right back Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us this hour talking
[04:41.640 --> 04:47.000]  about the possibility of war in Syria and the possibility of a fake beheading
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.040]  trying to drive us towards they want us to be right back
[04:58.120 --> 05:02.560]  another major health threat this one in Toledo Ohio where everybody in the
[05:02.560 --> 05:06.640]  entire city has been told not to drink the water Ohio's governor declaring a
[05:06.640 --> 05:11.400]  state of emergency did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100

[05:21.240 --> 05:25.600]  at a supermarket in Toledo you can see the shelves empty where water once was

[08:22.000 --> 08:30.920]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Monday August 25th 2014 I'm David Knight
[08:30.920 --> 08:35.760]  filling in for Alex today we are going to have an amazing show today now of
[08:35.760 --> 08:39.520]  course we had the earthquake news that happened yesterday there's wars that
[08:39.520 --> 08:43.120]  are being plotted and we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us at the bottom of
[08:43.120 --> 08:47.120]  this hour he's got a couple of articles up because things are changing a little
[08:47.120 --> 08:52.280]  bit you know as Stalin said one person dying is a tragedy but a million dying
[08:52.280 --> 08:56.880]  is a statistic they've tried over and over again to engineer war in Syria and
[08:56.880 --> 09:00.920]  so now the latest thing that is going to drive us there and of course Obama has
[09:00.920 --> 09:04.840]  said that this beheading of the journalist is actually an attack on our
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.360]  country but Paul Joseph Watson has a couple of articles up he says that
[09:08.360 --> 09:12.120]  experts these are experts in the UK say that James fully beheading video is
[09:12.120 --> 09:17.000]  likely fake and he's also then talking about how it's being used to push us
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.840]  into a Syria attack you know it was just a year ago that we were being told
[09:20.840 --> 09:25.120]  because of the sarin gas attack that we had to go to war with Syria meaning that
[09:25.120 --> 09:29.200]  we had to go to war against Assad now we're being told a year later that we
[09:29.200 --> 09:33.120]  have to go to war with Syria meaning that we have to go to war with Assad
[09:33.120 --> 09:38.240]  against the people that a year ago we were arming training people a year ago
[09:38.240 --> 09:44.160]  who are beheading Christians in Syria now that they've got an American we have
[09:44.160 --> 09:48.520]  to take that as an attack upon our country we now have to go to war yet the
[09:48.520 --> 09:54.480]  idea is that maybe this is not really the true a true beheading maybe this is
[09:54.480 --> 09:57.680]  likely fake so we're going to talk about the forensic evidence from these
[09:57.680 --> 10:01.320]  experts why they believe that it's fake with Paul Joseph Watson coming up in
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.280]  the next segment now yesterday we had the California earthquake I'm sure you've
[10:05.280 --> 10:10.160]  heard much about that there was also an earthquake in Peru a 6.9 versus the 6.1
[10:10.160 --> 10:14.320]  in California and of course there was the concern that there was going to be a
[10:14.320 --> 10:18.600]  volcanic eruption in Iceland they subsequently stepped down on that they
[10:18.600 --> 10:22.080]  said at first on Saturday that there were subglacial earthquakes they thought
[10:22.080 --> 10:24.760]  it would be another volcanic eruption if you remember when that happened a
[10:24.760 --> 10:30.040]  couple of years ago it had a huge impact on air traffic because of the volcanic
[10:30.040 --> 10:35.680]  ash and what it does to airplanes but we have a interview coming up in the third
[10:35.680 --> 10:40.440]  hour with Stan Dayo he's going to break that down for us he was on with Alex just
[10:40.440 --> 10:44.960]  four months ago talking about the increase in earthquakes we have an
[10:44.960 --> 10:49.000]  article up today on info wars.com why the earthquake near San Francisco is
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.160]  just the start of shaking in California this is by Michael Snyder I find it
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.960]  interesting that last Thursday Michael Snyder had another article said large
[10:57.960 --> 11:02.720]  holes forming near the New Madrid fault and a giant crack in the earth in New
[11:02.720 --> 11:07.800]  Mexico in North Mexico and he was talking about the increase in activity he
[11:07.800 --> 11:10.800]  said do you know that the number of big earthquakes during the first three months
[11:10.800 --> 11:15.400]  of 2014 was more than double the yearly average of what we've experienced since
[11:15.400 --> 11:20.720]  1979 did you know that the number of earthquakes in central and eastern US has
[11:20.720 --> 11:24.120]  quintupled in recent years so we're starting to see something that's very
[11:24.120 --> 11:28.080]  unusual and he talks about the New Madrid fault that's not in Spain actually
[11:28.080 --> 11:34.680]  that is in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi
[11:34.680 --> 11:40.560]  so it's east in United States central and eastern United States they had an
[11:40.560 --> 11:48.480]  earthquake back in October I'm sorry December of 1811 it was a magnitude 7.7
[11:48.480 --> 11:51.080]  earthquake there weren't very many people living there at the time but we do
[11:51.080 --> 11:57.720]  have information about that and it was horrendous at the time he says now
[11:57.720 --> 12:01.840]  there are 15 million people living in that area so what's going to happen are
[12:01.840 --> 12:06.560]  you going to get a warning the people in California got actually a 10-second
[12:06.560 --> 12:09.480]  warning in an area where they're constantly monitoring earthquake
[12:09.480 --> 12:14.600]  activity because that happens all the time in San Francisco maybe you should
[12:14.600 --> 12:18.160]  start thinking about what you need to do to prepare for some kind of a grid down
[12:18.160 --> 12:22.880]  emergency comes some kind of a natural disaster or a man-made disaster but
[12:22.880 --> 12:26.400]  we're going to be talking about what's going on with earthquakes with Stan
[12:26.400 --> 12:30.480]  Dayo in the third hour also Alex Jones will be joining us in the second hour
[12:30.480 --> 12:35.960]  he's got an interview with Joe Rogan you won't want to miss that now on
[12:35.960 --> 12:42.120]  immigration of course the Congress is on vacation right now and Obama had
[12:42.120 --> 12:48.280]  threatened that he would by executive order take action on immigration now
[12:48.280 --> 12:51.800]  that they're gone he's doubling down on this and a lot of people believe that
[12:51.800 --> 12:54.640]  it's very imminent we have an article from MarketWatch today and they're
[12:54.640 --> 12:58.520]  basically saying there's three reasons why he shouldn't do this three reason
[12:58.520 --> 13:03.440]  reasons why this would backfire one of the reasons is is that even if he could
[13:03.440 --> 13:07.680]  survive a court challenge with his executive order an executive order
[13:07.680 --> 13:11.720]  doesn't have comprehensive and permanent power of the law so they say a new
[13:11.720 --> 13:16.120]  president that comes in the next president in 2017 could just resend that
[13:16.120 --> 13:19.720]  order and basically he could even take punitive action against the people that
[13:19.720 --> 13:24.360]  are here he also talks about how another reason not to do this is that it's
[13:24.360 --> 13:28.600]  going to make a lot of people very angry you know a lot of people are getting
[13:28.600 --> 13:33.320]  very angry to see how the borders have been opened up to see how illegal
[13:33.320 --> 13:37.320]  aliens as they like to call them undocumented immigrants but they're
[13:37.320 --> 13:40.680]  really illegal aliens they're from another country they're not citizens
[13:40.680 --> 13:45.120]  here they're coming here illegally and yet we stand down and give them access
[13:45.120 --> 13:49.520]  to everything we let them violate pretty much most of the laws we give them
[13:49.520 --> 13:53.000]  better treatment than we do the poor who were born in this country who are
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.800]  citizens of this country a few weeks ago there was an incident in Times Square
[13:58.800 --> 14:03.040]  with a spider-man getting in fight with the cops there about panhandling and a
[14:03.040 --> 14:06.720]  lot of people have started looking at that and something very interesting has
[14:06.720 --> 14:11.400]  turned up about that we see that it's not just the government that is giving a
[14:11.400 --> 14:17.080]  free ride and an exception to illegal aliens it's also the corporations that
[14:17.080 --> 14:21.360]  are pushing so hard for control the internet through copyright legislation
[14:21.360 --> 14:24.960]  in other words saying if you're violating my copyright I need to be able to have
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.280]  legislation so that we can immediately shut down your website without any due
[14:29.280 --> 14:34.040]  process that's called Syspa Sopa Acta Pippa all those things that's what they
[14:34.040 --> 14:38.880]  want to do the justification for it is copyright violation and yet these
[14:38.880 --> 14:43.840]  Times Square characters are violating their copyright every day in the open
[14:43.840 --> 14:47.080]  let's take a look at what's going on there we've got a special report about
[14:47.080 --> 14:51.840]  that from the nightly news on Friday about two weeks ago it went viral when
[14:51.840 --> 14:56.440]  spider-man fought cops in Times Square the New York Times interviewed many of
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.240]  them looking behind the masks they talked to a Mexican Elmo an Ecuadorian
[15:01.240 --> 15:04.720]  Spongebob a Colombian Statue of Liberty and another one from the Dominican
[15:04.720 --> 15:09.360]  Republic Peruvian Toy Story characters a Moroccan spider-man a Colombian
[15:09.360 --> 15:14.760]  penguin that's right these costume characters are virtually all illegal
[15:14.760 --> 15:19.360]  aliens they came here illegally working menial jobs that paid very little then
[15:19.360 --> 15:23.920]  they learned they could buy unlicensed costumes from Peru and Panhandling
[15:23.920 --> 15:28.720]  Times Square the Ecuadorian Spongebob made $80 and just five hours on his
[15:28.720 --> 15:35.040]  first day Panhandling is against the law using someone else's copyrighted
[15:35.040 --> 15:38.840]  character in your business is against the law but the New York Times gives him
[15:38.840 --> 15:43.240]  a pass saying few performers seem to fully know the rules in part because of
[15:43.240 --> 15:48.840]  language barriers many do not speak English see it's okay they don't speak
[15:48.840 --> 15:53.320]  English illegal aliens are above all of our laws including our copyright laws
[15:53.320 --> 15:57.800]  yet we're told that because of copyright violations we have to hand over an
[15:57.800 --> 16:01.040]  internet kill switch to the government they want to be able to instantly shut
[16:01.040 --> 16:06.640]  down any website on a mere accusation of copyright violation and it's the very
[16:06.640 --> 16:11.320]  same companies that tolerate copyright violations in Times Square by illegal
[16:11.320 --> 16:15.400]  aliens that are screaming the loudest about internet control for copyright
[16:15.400 --> 16:19.560]  protection take Disney for example except for these illegal costume characters
[16:19.560 --> 16:24.120]  Disney has been incredibly aggressive in protecting their copyrights they got a
[16:24.120 --> 16:27.840]  lot of bad publicity back in 1986 when they threatened three daycare centers
[16:27.840 --> 16:31.900]  with expensive lawsuits because they had painted Disney characters on their
[16:31.900 --> 16:36.120]  walls and a barbera not only offered their characters as a replacement they
[16:36.120 --> 16:41.160]  sent their own studio artists to paint the mural then three years later Disney
[16:41.160 --> 16:44.600]  sued the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences the people who do the
[16:44.600 --> 16:48.600]  Oscars because they opened their Oscar show with Snow White and didn't get
[16:48.600 --> 17:05.480]  permission it's a shame they didn't stop that performance with a prior
[17:05.480 --> 17:11.120]  restraining order then in 2008 in a case exactly like what's going on in
[17:11.120 --> 17:15.120]  Times Square a couple with a children's party business performed for the kids
[17:15.120 --> 17:19.680]  in Winnie the Pooh costumes Disney sent them a cease and desist letter which
[17:19.680 --> 17:25.160]  they complied with except the demand to send Disney the costume instead they
[17:25.160 --> 17:29.120]  returned it to the unlicensed Peruvian company for credit the same company
[17:29.120 --> 17:33.640]  illegals in Times Square prefer to get their costumes from Disney slapped the
[17:33.640 --> 17:38.120]  couple with a one million dollar lawsuit plus attorneys fees and at the time
[17:38.120 --> 17:43.840]  Disney said this without firm licensing agreements the company noted it cannot
[17:43.840 --> 17:48.400]  control the quality and nature of the performance the quality of the costumes
[17:48.400 --> 17:53.320]  or the quality and background of the individuals providing the performance
[17:53.320 --> 17:58.080]  Disney's already seen its character turned into a sex toy story when an
[17:58.080 --> 18:03.120]  illegal Woody was arrested for sex abuse even Santa Claus as weighed in on the
[18:03.120 --> 18:08.080]  issue that's right the real Santa Claus a monk in North Pole Alaska who's
[18:08.080 --> 18:12.400]  legally changed his name wants licensing of these Times Square characters to
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.840]  screen out pedophiles but illegal costume characters want regulations to
[18:16.840 --> 18:22.640]  shut out competition especially those Americans who they say flout the law
[18:22.640 --> 18:27.760]  what's the Spanish word for irony but they seriously don't like Americans
[18:27.760 --> 18:33.000]  calling them money-grubbing Arabistas in other words newcomers Times Square
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.280]  they say is their territory the panhandling illegal costume character
[18:37.280 --> 18:42.360]  business is for illegal aliens who started it yet these black market
[18:42.360 --> 18:47.000]  entrepreneurs truly understand the basis of most of our business regulation
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.320]  and that is to keep out your competition now if they want the government to come
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.880]  in and regulate those money-grubbing Americans which laws are the illegal
[18:55.880 --> 18:59.480]  costume characters going to obey they want New York City to give them a
[18:59.480 --> 19:03.760]  license to illegally use copyrights should we ignore their copyright theft
[19:03.760 --> 19:07.600]  and call them undocumented costume characters until they get a license
[19:07.600 --> 19:11.680]  from Disney or Sesame Street are they even trying to get a copyright license
[19:11.680 --> 19:15.640]  they pretend they're not violating the copyrights by saying that they're just
[19:15.640 --> 19:19.400]  street performers and they're not doing this for a living but when New York City
[19:19.400 --> 19:24.040]  put up signs this past weekend telling tourists that photos are free tipping is
[19:24.040 --> 19:28.160]  optional an illegal costume character named Juan Perez complained that his
[19:28.160 --> 19:35.160]  income had dropped from $80 to $15 another Claudia Arias said we need to
[19:35.160 --> 19:40.640]  unite so people can see that this is our legitimate way of supporting our
[19:40.640 --> 19:44.720]  families but wait I thought so that's the report you can see the rest of that
[19:44.720 --> 19:48.760]  up on Alex Jones's YouTube channel that was from Friday night's nightly news
[19:48.760 --> 19:52.280]  they're going to actually create a union they're going to be able to keep those
[19:52.280 --> 19:56.080]  money-grubbing Americans at a Times Square perhaps it's La Fuente that
[19:56.080 --> 19:58.960]  they're turning to we're going to be right back after the break with Paul

[24:14.360 --> 24:17.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here in Austin and we have
[24:17.800 --> 24:22.240]  Paul Joseph Watson joining us in the UK he's got a couple of articles up on
[24:22.240 --> 24:26.080]  info wars.com today of course the staged Foley beheading is being used as a
[24:26.080 --> 24:30.240]  poster child for a Syria attack we had an article just last Friday saying the
[24:30.240 --> 24:34.560]  Obama administration said that Foley's execution was quote an attack on our
[24:34.560 --> 24:39.080]  country and the deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes said it was the first
[24:39.080 --> 24:45.720]  ISIS attack on America this reminds me of the saying that Stalin always said
[24:45.720 --> 24:49.880]  you know a million deaths is a statistic but one death is a tragedy
[24:49.880 --> 24:52.800]  they're trying to bring this home especially for Americans they showed
[24:52.800 --> 24:59.240]  people dying of sarin gas a year ago in Syria and perhaps they thought that
[24:59.240 --> 25:03.040]  Americans didn't get involved in that because it wasn't Americans that they
[25:03.040 --> 25:09.560]  saw dying but actually what happened was we also exposed that it was not really
[25:09.560 --> 25:14.720]  a case that it was only the Syrian government of Assad that could have done
[25:14.720 --> 25:18.920]  that we made it very clear that there had been previous attacks of sarin gas
[25:18.920 --> 25:23.040]  where the United Nations as well as Russian and American intelligence
[25:23.040 --> 25:27.960]  analysts had said that the sarin gas had been used by rebels previously to that
[25:27.960 --> 25:33.000]  and so it wasn't true that that could have only been Assad so the whole
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.600]  narrative a year ago failed at that time they wanted to go to war with Assad in
[25:37.600 --> 25:42.280]  Syria now they want to go to war on his side against the people that they were
[25:42.280 --> 25:46.480]  funding over the last year and there's been an interesting development over the
[25:46.480 --> 25:50.440]  weekend that's why we have Paul Joseph Watson on is that experts in the UK are
[25:50.440 --> 25:55.760]  saying that this video of the beheading was likely fake so I want to go to Paul
[25:55.760 --> 26:01.200]  now Paul thank you for joining us hi David good to be back now this video
[26:01.200 --> 26:04.880]  tell us some of the aspects before we get into the implication of how they're
[26:04.880 --> 26:09.360]  trying to use this to start another war tell us what these experts in the UK
[26:09.360 --> 26:16.520]  are saying about this video why they believe that it was fake well I made a
[26:16.520 --> 26:20.760]  video last week Thursday questioning whether this was fake because what
[26:20.760 --> 26:25.520]  peaked my interest was the fact that UK authorities the police came out and said
[26:25.520 --> 26:31.040]  literally hours after this video was released but if you watch this video of
[26:31.040 --> 26:35.560]  this alleged beheading on YouTube not merely share it disseminate it post the
[26:35.560 --> 26:40.280]  link on Facebook if you simply watch it then you could be a terrorist you could
[26:40.280 --> 26:44.920]  be breaking laws under the terrorist act so that suggested to me that they
[26:44.920 --> 26:50.720]  weren't too keen on people watching it so I made a video on Thursday questioning
[26:50.720 --> 26:54.120]  some of the aspects of this so-called beheading clip let's make it clear from
[26:54.120 --> 26:59.200]  the start in the original clip of this so-called ISIS beheading of James Foley
[26:59.200 --> 27:05.520]  you do not see Foley being beheaded all you see is six so-called slashes of
[27:05.520 --> 27:10.320]  the knife across his neck and then it fades to black then it cuts to a still
[27:10.320 --> 27:16.240]  image of Foley's decapitated head resting on his body so at no point do you
[27:16.240 --> 27:20.480]  actually see him being physically beheaded and all these points that I'm
[27:20.480 --> 27:24.720]  making now were replicated by these forensic experts that came out yesterday
[27:24.720 --> 27:29.760]  and said the same thing that I said and many others said last week the other
[27:29.760 --> 27:33.840]  main point David is the fact that when he's reading out his speech Foley
[27:33.840 --> 27:39.120]  before he's beheaded he's completely calm he's completely composed it's not the
[27:39.120 --> 27:43.880]  behavior of somebody who knows that they're about to be brutally slaughtered
[27:43.880 --> 27:51.440]  and in fact the forensic experts came afterwards and said that he actually had
[27:51.440 --> 27:55.240]  to redo one of the lip in the footage they said he had to refilm one of the
[27:55.240 --> 27:58.040]  lines because he mocked it up so he was going off a script
[27:58.040 --> 28:01.480]  if demeanor was obviously not of a person waiting to be beheaded so we'll get
[28:01.480 --> 28:05.000]  into it more after the break well it was interesting and I want to talk after the
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.320]  break too about this censorship because that is a major reversal I mean we ought
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.440]  to be concerned at any time that the government says watching a video makes
[28:14.440 --> 28:20.960]  you a terrorist and yet they've been very accepting of ISIS and other terrorist
[28:20.960 --> 28:25.560]  groups Facebook postings and social media postings at the same time when we
[28:25.560 --> 28:29.600]  put things up they will censor it if we try to share it with other people so
[28:29.600 --> 28:36.040]  that was a very amazing reversal of their policy to say but don't even look at
[28:36.040 --> 28:41.240]  this even though they had left the previous Islamic Paris social media
[28:41.240 --> 28:45.000]  postings up for everybody to see censoring people who are pushing back
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.640]  against that so that right there raised a lot of flags besides setting a very
[28:49.640 --> 28:54.720]  dangerous precedent for everyone exactly the free flow of information
[28:54.720 --> 29:00.120]  precedent and you know we saw the images flashed across the news we saw the
[29:00.120 --> 29:03.320]  net is being pushed and yet they were encouraging not just encouraging but
[29:03.320 --> 29:06.720]  warning people not to watch the video which suggested to me that there was
[29:06.720 --> 29:12.720]  something very wrong with it indeed and again it cut is completely contradict
[29:12.720 --> 29:16.280]  previous beheading videos where you have a group of these militants
[29:16.280 --> 29:20.560]  surrounding the individual they all chant al-ar-aqbar as he's being killed
[29:20.560 --> 29:25.240]  they cite the Koran before they kill him you'll see none of this in the James
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.120]  Folly video I think it's also interesting that the guy who did it is
[29:29.120 --> 29:32.760]  supposedly a British guy as well so we'll talk about all that when we come
[29:32.760 --> 29:37.120]  back with Paul Joseph Watson the UK we're talking about the latest perhaps
[29:37.120 --> 29:41.640]  false flag used to try to get us into a war in Syria this time on a different
[29:41.640 --> 29:46.080]  side we'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson stay with us
[29:46.080 --> 29:54.360]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[33:05.120 --> 33:13.240]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:13.240 --> 33:21.000]  welcome back to the alex joe show I'm David Knight in Austin and joining me
[33:21.000 --> 33:24.960]  right now from the UK is Paul Joseph Watson we've been talking about his
[33:24.960 --> 33:31.080]  articles he analyzed the video last week talking about the holy beheading and
[33:31.080 --> 33:36.640]  said that he had concerns based on the fact that it was we were told not to
[33:36.640 --> 33:40.040]  watch it we were threatened not to watch it we were threatened that we would be
[33:40.040 --> 33:45.400]  considered terrorists it's an amazing reversal of what the UK and the American
[33:45.400 --> 33:49.920]  governments have done essentially giving carte blanche to these Islamic terrorist
[33:49.920 --> 33:55.360]  groups and their social media postings while censoring people from sharing our
[33:55.360 --> 34:00.840]  information many times on info wars dot-coms Facebook site so it was an
[34:00.840 --> 34:04.440]  amazing reversal and so that got his curiosity up I think other people were
[34:04.440 --> 34:08.560]  curious about that as well and so we had some experts testify this weekend that
[34:08.560 --> 34:13.200]  they believe that it was a fake beheading but this is all being done to
[34:13.200 --> 34:18.760]  set the stage again for war a year ago it was war with Syria now a year later
[34:18.760 --> 34:24.520]  it's war with Syria except this time it's with Assad instead of against Assad
[34:24.520 --> 34:28.000]  this time they want to go to war with the group that they were funding and
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.360]  training last year and when everybody said that we were not going to be al-Qaeda's
[34:32.360 --> 34:38.640]  air force we had Ted Cruz say that we had Dennis Kucinich say that and it was
[34:38.640 --> 34:42.880]  true we were equipping and training these guys and they said we're not going to be
[34:42.880 --> 34:45.880]  their air force there was a questionable trying to blame the
[34:45.880 --> 34:50.320]  saring gas attack saying that it could have only come from the rubble from the
[34:50.320 --> 34:54.800]  from Assad and that narrative failed at the time with analysis and so now
[34:54.800 --> 34:58.160]  they're coming up with something different Paul I'm reminded of the fact
[34:58.160 --> 35:03.120]  that Henry Kissinger said that we don't have any permanent allies only
[35:03.120 --> 35:06.440]  permanent interests I think maybe the permanent interest of the American
[35:06.440 --> 35:10.960]  government is to somehow get involved in a war in Syria doesn't really matter
[35:10.960 --> 35:16.520]  which side we get on does it well exactly this is the poster child for
[35:16.520 --> 35:21.840]  military expansion into Syria as you said go to 2013 almost a year ago
[35:21.840 --> 35:27.120]  actually just over a year ago chemical weapons attack obviously blamed on the
[35:27.120 --> 35:32.200]  Assad government we talked to eyewitnesses who went to the very region
[35:32.200 --> 35:37.320]  talked to the rebels who were stationed in the region and that's included an
[35:37.320 --> 35:41.000]  associated press reporter who went there or who coordinated with another
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.880]  reporter who went there and they said that the Saudis have provided the
[35:44.880 --> 35:49.480]  chemical weapons to the rebels they had mishandled them causing this chemical
[35:49.480 --> 35:54.640]  weapons tragedy of course it was blamed on Assad immediately to grease the skids
[35:54.640 --> 36:00.040]  for war MIT later investigated the incident concluded that it could not
[36:00.040 --> 36:04.800]  have been launched from a government area but at the end of August 2013 we
[36:04.800 --> 36:08.080]  were right on the verge of going into Syria it was only derailed at the last
[36:08.080 --> 36:15.040]  minute so and here we are again a year later in August except this time they've
[36:15.040 --> 36:18.760]  got a different pretense for going to war and they want to go to they want to
[36:18.760 --> 36:23.680]  fight on a different side but still in Syria isn't that interesting it's it's
[36:23.680 --> 36:28.080]  also interesting that some of the neocons are saying well Obama should have
[36:28.080 --> 36:31.960]  armed the rebels in the first place then ISIS wouldn't have spread which again is
[36:31.960 --> 36:36.920]  a complete misnomer because most of the rebel groups became more and more hard
[36:36.920 --> 36:42.680]  line and in fact many of them defected to ISIS but so they were supported in
[36:42.680 --> 36:49.200]  fact with some weapons and hundreds of millions of dollars of aid
[36:49.200 --> 36:54.560]  I think we're breaking up a little bit on your on your skype feed there talking
[36:54.560 --> 37:00.840]  point is I think we're yeah we're losing a little bit on on Skype here it's
[37:00.840 --> 37:05.520]  essentially to I remember a number of years ago there was a site I think it
[37:05.520 --> 37:10.320]  was either national impune or the onion and they had a headline making fun of
[37:10.320 --> 37:15.280]  the fact that Americans are really only concerned about what happens to Americans
[37:15.280 --> 37:20.080]  and it was something like a chaos stand earthquake kills millions to Americans
[37:20.080 --> 37:25.440]  feared missing so they're trying to bring this particular one home by showing
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.720]  an American journalist being killed that's what the narrative is about I
[37:29.720 --> 37:34.360]  think they're trying to I think we got Paul back with us now Paul go ahead yeah
[37:34.360 --> 37:38.200]  I was just saying a lot of these video tapes get released the opportune times
[37:38.200 --> 37:42.920]  for military expansion in the Middle East so before the surge or just as the
[37:42.920 --> 37:48.480]  surge was ending in 2007 a bin Laden tape pop-up which criticised the US
[37:48.480 --> 37:53.120]  government for its inaction in the Middle East again before the 2004 election
[37:53.120 --> 37:56.720]  of course we have bin Laden pop-up many attributed that to Bush winning the
[37:56.720 --> 38:01.880]  election several other examples so these so-called al-Qaeda or terrorist
[38:01.880 --> 38:06.680]  video tapes have only ever proven opportune for the US military industrial
[38:06.680 --> 38:11.800]  complex and we now see that happening again the rhetoric is really over the
[38:11.800 --> 38:16.760]  top as well as I've mentioned this article from Friday headline Obama
[38:16.760 --> 38:20.320]  administration says that Foley's execution is quote an attack on our
[38:20.320 --> 38:25.160]  country and the deputy national secretary security adviser Ben Rhodes said
[38:25.160 --> 38:30.520]  it was the first ISIS attack on America in other words you know this is a direct
[38:30.520 --> 38:36.200]  attack on America and yet we have the Obama administration standing down at
[38:36.200 --> 38:40.080]  the border completely opening it up having the border patrol standing down
[38:40.080 --> 38:44.920]  essentially and as we reported many times there are people from all
[38:44.920 --> 38:48.960]  nationalities not just people from Central America that are able to come
[38:48.960 --> 38:54.240]  through that and it's open to terrorists from the Middle East it's open to
[38:54.240 --> 38:58.560]  terrorists from Central and South America because many of these drug cartels
[38:58.560 --> 39:04.240]  are terrorist groups they're you doing human they're not just engaged in drug
[39:04.240 --> 39:07.440]  trafficking they're doing human trafficking they're kidnapping they're
[39:07.440 --> 39:11.240]  killing people they're beheading people who oppose them so there's not a whole
[39:11.240 --> 39:15.320]  lot of difference between the actions of these people and yet they're using this
[39:15.320 --> 39:20.080]  open immigration as cover to try to get people in they're also trying to
[39:20.080 --> 39:23.120]  betrayed in the media as if it's just children coming across if they were
[39:23.120 --> 39:27.120]  really concerned about this and if they're really concerned about terrorism
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.120]  coming to America I would think that they would do something about the border
[39:31.120 --> 39:35.360]  well exactly there's a lot of talking points today about you know ISIS all
[39:35.360 --> 39:40.800]  they need to do is get on a plane to attack America well they don't even
[39:40.800 --> 39:46.920]  have to do that they can just walk across the border exactly and now we're
[39:46.920 --> 39:50.960]  seeing you know Lindsay Graham who's been pushing for well over a year for the
[39:50.960 --> 39:56.160]  attack on Syria he's back pushing this narrative there's a new context they
[39:56.160 --> 40:01.000]  call it a new context given to this impetus by this James Foley beheading
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.080]  video so it's supposed to child for a war on Syria basically there's some noise
[40:07.080 --> 40:12.960]  about oh we could coordinate with Assad to attack ISIS again Assad has said on
[40:12.960 --> 40:18.920]  many occasions any military involvement by the US aggressing against Syria is an
[40:18.920 --> 40:22.560]  act of war so I don't believe for a second that they're gonna coordinate with
[40:22.560 --> 40:26.640]  like with Assad and that he's going to accept it it's not going to happen and
[40:26.640 --> 40:31.600]  again this is all based on what these forensic experts have said is a fake
[40:31.600 --> 40:36.960]  video now we know ISIS is brutal savage they've killed hundreds of thousands of
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.640]  people in cold blood why would they censor their own video why would they
[40:41.640 --> 40:47.520]  not be head Foley and show it to the world for the shock value because I've
[40:47.520 --> 40:51.440]  suggested and it's pretty clear from this video and from the analysis that this
[40:51.440 --> 40:57.240]  video was not produced and released by ISIS it was most likely produced by the
[40:57.240 --> 41:00.880]  same kind of companies linked with the military industrial complex that we've
[41:00.880 --> 41:06.320]  seen produce al-Qaeda videos before as you mentioned in the article and as you
[41:06.320 --> 41:10.520]  mentioned in the last segment you see them drawing a knife across his neck six
[41:10.520 --> 41:14.640]  times but there's no blood to be seen and then as you just pointed out they do
[41:14.640 --> 41:22.600]  a cut you know a video cut should say and come back showing the head off so why
[41:22.600 --> 41:25.320]  would as you point out why would they censor this when they put up all of this
[41:25.320 --> 41:29.400]  other graphic stuff and why would our governments say you're not allowed to
[41:29.400 --> 41:33.880]  watch this one essentially promote this stuff they just want the narrative to go
[41:33.880 --> 41:38.280]  out there for the usual suspects like Lindsey Graham who as I said before he's
[41:38.280 --> 41:41.960]  kind of like a hundred percent Machiavellian with a thin veneer Gomer pile
[41:41.960 --> 41:46.920]  this guy is always there pushing war along with John McCain who was
[41:46.920 --> 41:52.800]  photographed in Syria with al-Qaeda rebels and terrorists just a year ago
[41:52.800 --> 41:57.280]  trying to push these guys into war now we're supposed to go to war against the
[41:57.280 --> 42:05.640]  guys that Lindsey Graham and McCain supported a year ago it's amazing and I
[42:05.640 --> 42:09.960]  mean you can you can delve into it even more if you zoom in on the actual be
[42:09.960 --> 42:13.600]  heading the so-called moment of beheading which we don't actually see
[42:13.600 --> 42:17.920]  but when he starts to cut the throat you can see the guys actually got what
[42:17.920 --> 42:21.800]  looks like blood packets ready to release and he started releasing them and
[42:21.800 --> 42:26.440]  then the video cuts to black so there's all kind of analysis going into this but
[42:26.440 --> 42:32.520]  it's it's again his demeanor before he's being beheaded is composed this is not a
[42:32.520 --> 42:37.920]  guy who thinks or knows he's about to be brutally slaughtered I mean anyone else
[42:37.920 --> 42:42.440]  wouldn't even be able to speak never mind calmly read out this this script yes
[42:42.440 --> 42:46.400]  and it just looks like a theatrical production and that's what these experts
[42:46.400 --> 42:50.320]  said it's just amazing for it but you know me to be called a conspiracy
[42:50.320 --> 42:54.600]  theorist last week and then these top experts working for British police
[42:54.600 --> 42:59.680]  basically make all the same points I did in my YouTube video and yet it's still
[42:59.680 --> 43:04.600]  kind of under the radar and we're still treating this video as a real cast as
[43:04.600 --> 43:08.800]  belly a real you know something that greases the skids for war when it's
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.360]  obviously staged yeah Anthony Frida has a great graphic I don't know if we've got
[43:13.360 --> 43:17.800]  that up or not I think that was gonna go up on the site essentially showing
[43:17.800 --> 43:23.440]  these guys to get to get the idea do you guys have that graphic there I don't
[43:23.440 --> 43:27.200]  know if we've got it up on the side or not but basically he's got the this
[43:27.200 --> 43:31.080]  picture that you've seen of Foley on his knees and the guy in black standing
[43:31.080 --> 43:35.360]  behind him with the knife and they're standing on a set that's a giant green
[43:35.360 --> 43:40.680]  screen behind them and then you see the composited picture on a monitor in the
[43:40.680 --> 43:44.120]  front and all the studio lights and everything I mean that basically says
[43:44.120 --> 43:49.360]  it all doesn't it Paul it does and I mean this stretches back years we were
[43:49.360 --> 43:54.040]  doing articles in 2007 Al Qaeda videotaped digitally doctored they
[43:54.040 --> 43:58.320]  actually discovered that the terrorist logo was being embedded into the video
[43:58.320 --> 44:03.560]  at the same time as the Intel Center logo Intel Center was company that
[44:03.560 --> 44:08.400]  screened terrorist videos basically for the Pentagon released them having
[44:08.400 --> 44:14.360]  obtained them who knows how from terrorist groups but actually found out
[44:14.360 --> 44:19.920]  that the terrorist media their logo was being added to the video at the same time
[44:19.920 --> 44:23.560]  as Intel Center this group that basically works for the Pentagon and this
[44:23.560 --> 44:27.000]  this happened numerous times we documented it over and over again and
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.440]  those videos kind of they tailed off and stopped but now they're back with yet
[44:31.440 --> 44:35.480]  another one and it's it's even more suspicious we've got for people who are
[44:35.480 --> 44:38.760]  watching the feed now we've got that picture I was just describing of the
[44:38.760 --> 44:44.480]  the graphic that Anthony Frida did that basically shows the US government on one
[44:44.480 --> 44:47.160]  screen they show the composite picture on another and then you see this big
[44:47.160 --> 44:51.360]  studio set with a green screen and the two guys standing in front of it there
[44:51.360 --> 44:56.800]  apparently doesn't seem to be any limit as to what they will do to control
[44:56.800 --> 44:59.920]  public opinion and of course we've seen in the past you've reported on it in the
[44:59.920 --> 45:06.240]  past as well Paul how they're focusing on manipulating opinions they did a study
[45:06.240 --> 45:11.760]  in Facebook I think that was your article where they used it use Facebook
[45:11.760 --> 45:16.240]  postings to try to modify people's attitudes try to make them happy to try
[45:16.240 --> 45:22.240]  to make them sad we've seen that Palantir has purchased a company that
[45:22.240 --> 45:28.600]  basically data mines social network specifically Twitter one example of what
[45:28.600 --> 45:32.720]  they were able to do was during an awards show they were able to monitor
[45:32.720 --> 45:36.280]  people who were talking about particular hairstyle of a couple of
[45:36.280 --> 45:41.720]  particular actresses and then send them a specific product targeted you know
[45:41.720 --> 45:45.440]  that where they could get that same kind of hairstyle that company has been now
[45:45.440 --> 45:51.200]  bought by Palantir which was essentially created by the CIA in cutel
[45:51.200 --> 45:55.440]  their venture capital company that's what they're trying to do they're trying
[45:55.440 --> 45:59.960]  to monitor everything in social media they're trying to manipulate public
[45:59.960 --> 46:02.920]  opinion and social media just like they're manipulating people to buy a
[46:02.920 --> 46:05.920]  particular hairstyle they want to see what you're talking about and then they
[46:05.920 --> 46:10.240]  want to send you information that's basically going to either reinforce what
[46:10.240 --> 46:16.840]  you're talking about or essentially change you from one opinion to another
[46:16.840 --> 46:21.760]  precisely and they're doing that not only to monitor political opinions I
[46:21.760 --> 46:30.320]  remember that famous scene in v for vendetta where they cruised picking up
[46:30.320 --> 46:33.360]  people's paper with the government it's a similar kind of thing there was a
[46:33.360 --> 46:38.720]  story recently about DARPA they're being tasked with gathering information in
[46:38.720 --> 46:43.920]  fact they were hiring a subcontractor to do it to gather information on how
[46:43.920 --> 46:50.040]  prone Americans are to civil unrest and riots obviously with what happened in
[46:50.040 --> 46:53.280]  Ferguson over the past couple of weeks that's a major concern so they're
[46:53.280 --> 46:57.960]  developing these tools to monitor social media and private conversations not only
[46:57.960 --> 47:06.080]  to gauge people's political opinions but to engage with rest and riots is coming
[47:06.080 --> 47:11.760]  sooner rather than later yes yes absolutely on a different note I wanted
[47:11.760 --> 47:15.080]  to and kind of maybe I'm just kind of springing this on you but I just noticed
[47:15.080 --> 47:20.120]  that they're having a final TV showdown tonight debate in Scotland on
[47:20.120 --> 47:23.440]  independence and they say this is a final debate that they're having there
[47:23.440 --> 47:27.200]  break that down for the people here in America I know we got Scottish John that
[47:27.200 --> 47:32.360]  comes on a lot and does a promo for us tell us what's going on there in the
[47:32.360 --> 47:37.360]  UK in terms of Scotland because we see this kind of devolution or secession
[47:37.360 --> 47:41.320]  that's going on in many places all over the world people desiring I think in
[47:41.320 --> 47:47.400]  many cases to have a little bit more local control and so we see alliances
[47:47.400 --> 47:50.440]  that have been together particularly in this case they say Scotland's had a
[47:50.440 --> 47:54.920]  307 year union with England and there's a lot of people in Scotland even though
[47:54.920 --> 48:01.320]  it's a minority of the people it's still 43% against 57% 43% of the people
[48:01.320 --> 48:06.240]  would like to break away from the UK have their separation in Scotland
[48:06.240 --> 48:13.080]  independence yeah I think that's that's a reflection the corruption basically
[48:13.080 --> 48:17.040]  emanating out of London and again I agree with you any move towards
[48:17.040 --> 48:21.560]  development where power is concentrated in in more hands you know it's it's
[48:21.560 --> 48:26.320]  local it's not national is something to be celebrated so you know while it's not
[48:26.320 --> 48:32.200]  an issue that I follow that closely the general principle of it I would I would
[48:32.200 --> 48:35.920]  vehemently agree with and I know for a fact that the establishment media in
[48:35.920 --> 48:41.520]  Britain has been vocally against it pushing against Scotland's basically
[48:41.520 --> 48:46.360]  their secession from from the United Kingdom so it's something that I
[48:46.360 --> 48:50.720]  personally would support and of course we've seen this happening in various
[48:50.720 --> 48:54.280]  places throughout Europe we've seen it in Spain and other places where you have
[48:54.280 --> 48:59.360]  different regions who essentially want to have a little bit more self-rule at the
[48:59.360 --> 49:02.560]  same time in America though we see everything being more and more
[49:02.560 --> 49:06.560]  consolidated it and we also see that the consolidation is coming at an
[49:06.560 --> 49:10.400]  international level through these trade agreements that are happening all of
[49:10.400 --> 49:14.680]  this is part of what general Petraeus said when he was in London what comes
[49:14.680 --> 49:18.560]  after North America after American he said well that's the North American
[49:18.560 --> 49:22.400]  Union so at the same time that people are trying to get their independence in
[49:22.400 --> 49:27.200]  many places like Scotland there's a big move for that there is at the top they're
[49:27.200 --> 49:31.000]  moving to the next level it's that they look at the North American Union as
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.600]  being something that's been an accomplished fact for 20 years so now
[49:33.600 --> 49:36.840]  they're trying to create a union between the North American Union and the
[49:36.840 --> 49:41.520]  European Union I think that's probably why we're seeing the rise of parties
[49:41.520 --> 49:45.880]  like UKIP and in the UK as well isn't it pushing back against that kind of
[49:45.880 --> 49:52.560]  consolidation precisely I mean this this agenda for world government which in
[49:52.560 --> 49:57.280]  terms of Europe was happening way back in the 50s they wanted to create a
[49:57.280 --> 50:02.000]  European political federation run directly from Brussels in fact there are
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.520]  Bilderberg documents which talk about that at length they introduced it under
[50:06.520 --> 50:10.600]  the guise of a free trade agreement to slip it under the radar and it
[50:10.600 --> 50:14.920]  gradually built up after that so they plan to get their three pillars of world
[50:14.920 --> 50:20.480]  government in place by the year 2000 they're way behind schedule which is now
[50:20.480 --> 50:26.280]  why we see these secret agreements taking place like TPP to try and fast
[50:26.280 --> 50:32.160]  track that because of the failings exactly they've had so far in
[50:32.160 --> 50:35.760]  conventional means so definitely remains the agenda and it was just last
[50:35.760 --> 50:39.080]  Wednesday that we had the CEO of the John Burt society he'd written a book
[50:39.080 --> 50:42.520]  specifically about that how they were going to have global governance and
[50:42.520 --> 50:47.200]  unification through trade agreements and now we see that happening we see that
[50:47.200 --> 50:50.880]  kind of secretive closed government where these agreements are being
[50:50.880 --> 50:54.840]  negotiated secret and our elected representatives are not even allowed to
[50:54.840 --> 50:58.440]  view the agreement we'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK

[54:16.280 --> 54:20.480]  Austin we have Paul Joseph Watson with us on the phone from the UK of course in
[54:20.480 --> 54:24.080]  the third hour we're going to have Stan Dayo joining us he's gonna be talking
[54:24.080 --> 54:28.760]  about the recent increase in earthquakes and of course it was very active this
[54:28.760 --> 54:34.400]  weekend we had a 6.1 earthquake in California we had a 6.9 in Peru we had
[54:34.400 --> 54:38.680]  warnings about a volcano that was imminent about to explode in Iceland
[54:38.680 --> 54:42.880]  of course they moved that down but there's been a tremendous increase in
[54:42.880 --> 54:46.600]  volcanic activity Stan Dayo is going to join us in the third hour at the bottom
[54:46.600 --> 54:51.520]  of this next hour Alex Jones is going to be interviewing Joe Rogan but in the
[54:51.520 --> 54:55.440]  few minutes that we've got left of this hour I want to talk to talk to you Paul
[54:55.440 --> 54:59.080]  about ISIS kind of break it down in general we got a little bit away from
[54:59.080 --> 55:02.680]  that in the last segment I started talking about Scotland independence vote
[55:02.680 --> 55:06.880]  but let's let's get back to ISIS talk about it in general tell us about its
[55:06.880 --> 55:11.640]  origins its funding just kind of break that down a little bit for the audience
[55:11.640 --> 55:16.960]  well this is the elephant in the living room nobody talks about when we're you
[55:16.960 --> 55:26.240]  know getting increasingly involved again in Iraq into is being funded by
[55:26.240 --> 55:30.680]  America's biggest allies in the region but I mean this they're being called the
[55:30.680 --> 55:35.400]  richest terrorist group ever existed their money is coming from Kuwait Qatar and
[55:35.400 --> 55:40.960]  Saudi Arabia as well as Turkey in fact the Iraqi Prime Minister went on live
[55:40.960 --> 55:45.880]  television not long ago and pointed the finger directly at Saudi Arabia he
[55:45.880 --> 55:49.640]  accused them of quote inciting and encouraging the terrorist movement I
[55:49.640 --> 55:54.000]  accuse them of supporting politically and in the media and supporting them with
[55:54.000 --> 56:01.840]  money and buying weapons for them so that was the Iraqi Prime Minister accusing
[56:01.840 --> 56:05.040]  Saudi America's closest allies in the region of directly supporting with
[56:05.040 --> 56:11.160]  weapons and training ISIS militants and of course we know back in 2012 many of
[56:11.160 --> 56:16.800]  these ISIS insurgents were in fact trained by the US that's a secret base
[56:16.800 --> 56:22.760]  in Jordan in 2012 and again they were training these militants to try and
[56:22.760 --> 56:29.720]  overthrow Bashar al-Assad even though we saw video was the
[56:29.720 --> 56:36.800]  only beheading we saw FSA rebels cutting out the internal organs of Syrian army
[56:36.800 --> 56:41.480]  soldiers and eating them on camera we saw numerous beheadings numerous
[56:41.480 --> 56:44.840]  sources of women and children worse than anything you're gonna see in that
[56:44.840 --> 56:50.520]  folly video that was all being backed by your tax money basically by the US by
[56:50.520 --> 56:55.680]  Britain yes to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars and so again a lot
[56:55.680 --> 57:00.400]  of these rebel groups that started off as so-called moderate rebel groups in
[57:00.400 --> 57:07.000]  Syria became increasingly more extreme joined more extreme groups pledged
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  allegiance to the likes of Jabhat al-Nusra and then later on ISIS so the
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.880]  origin of this spread of ISIS throughout Syria throughout Iraq can be
[57:15.880 --> 57:20.200]  directly traced back to the Obama administration policy of not only
[57:20.200 --> 57:25.640]  supporting FSA rebels in Syria but in fact the overthrow of Gaddafi in Libya
[57:25.640 --> 57:31.080]  because they then took a lot of those extremists ship them over into Syria to
[57:31.080 --> 57:35.560]  radicalize the factions that were already active in Syria so this is this is
[57:35.560 --> 57:42.280]  blowback if you are at malfeasance on behalf of the Obama administration and
[57:42.280 --> 57:46.640]  its foreign policy in Libya and Syria and of course it's been going on much
[57:46.640 --> 57:50.200]  longer than that it was the Reagan administration that essentially created
[57:50.200 --> 57:53.880]  al-Qaeda they at the time they were calling them Mujahideen and of course
[57:53.880 --> 57:59.280]  they also funded Central American revolutions and it's always about a
[57:59.280 --> 58:03.400]  constant state of war of course they have financial interests immediate interest
[58:03.400 --> 58:08.920]  that they get rewarded for but it is also about a constant state of war having
[58:08.920 --> 58:12.480]  an enemy out there they're very concerned about the peace dividend when
[58:12.480 --> 58:14.720]  that broke out it's like well what are we going to do we're gonna have to
[58:14.720 --> 58:19.080]  downsize the military we're gonna get rid of the CIA no no we've got a new
[58:19.080 --> 58:24.080]  mission for them terrorism of course it will never end because the the enemy is
[58:24.080 --> 58:28.040]  so amorphous thank you for joining us Paul Joseph Watson from the UK we're
[58:28.040 --> 58:31.680]  gonna be back in the next hour with Alex Jones and Joe Rogan an interview you
[58:31.680 --> 58:34.760]  don't want to miss that and in the third hour we're going to have Stan Dayo

[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:28.320]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.680]  we're gonna have Alex Jones and Joe Rogan at the bottom of the hour but I
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.680]  want to break down a little bit of news today I guess we've got so much weather
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.600]  news I guess you could call it with the earthquakes going on let's have a little
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:44.600]  bit of sports as well we've got a story from the New York Daily News
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.880]  Obamacare curveball they point out that there was a game last week between the
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:54.040]  Cubs and the Giants they had an epic four and a half hour rain delay they
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.080]  said and the problem was that the ground crew couldn't cover the playing
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.520]  surface before the downpour now it turns out this is actually a story about
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.920]  Obamacare in reality because they said earlier in the night the Cubs
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:11.760]  management had sent home ten workers that would normally have covered the
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:15.600]  field so that it wouldn't have been totally trashed by the rain they'd sent
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.480]  home ten workers in part to keep them under the 30 hour per week limit so they
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.240]  could avoid paying health benefits under the affordable health care act so there
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.640]  you go if you think that it really doesn't matter if all you want to do is
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.240]  sit there and watch sports well you know what you're even gonna have an effect
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:39.120]  on your sports and of course it is gonna affect everybody it's gonna affect a lot
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.800]  of people who are working minimum wage jobs may these people rabid Obama
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.920]  supporters are going to find that they now have to work two jobs because they
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.920]  can't get more than 30 hours from their employer that's just one of the adverse
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:57.600]  effects of Obamacare of course the worst part of it in my opinion is the idea
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:04.040]  that we've got a president who can essentially by executive order or a
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:09.520]  government can go in and make you buy things now we've got Obama talking about
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.480]  using executive orders to push through his amnesty for illegal aliens
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.800]  threatening to do that while the Congress is on vacation now I want to give
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.760]  you this news because we're talking about earthquakes we're talking about the
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:30.000]  fact that people in San Francisco only got a 10-second warning about that we
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.960]  want you to understand that it's a possibility that it could happen even on
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.200]  the east coast and you need to take some preparations because 10 seconds isn't
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.200]  going to allow you to do anything in terms of preparing in case the
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.960]  infrastructure goes down but we also want to warn you here at Info Wars about
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.760]  other things that are going to immediately affect your health this story
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.600]  that was up on Friday came up late on Friday a common antibiotic is linked to
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.680]  sudden heart deaths in the UK they said a Dutch study found that people who are
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:04.720]  taking Chlorithromycin I think if I'm pronouncing it correctly were 76% more
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.840]  likely to die than those who are taking penicillin and the risk was greater in
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:15.720]  women who are more than twice as likely to die now this drug Chlorithromycin is
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.240]  used for respiratory infections and they say that these were the dosages that
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.520]  are typically prescribed in England 2.2 milligram dosages so that's something if
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.560]  you've got anybody that is taking that you may want to read very carefully the
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.560]  warning labels always read the warning labels and take them seriously I know
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.600]  that my mother had a debilitating stroke late in life from an antibiotic that she
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.000]  took so I can certainly understand that this would cause sudden heart deaths it
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.400]  was actually you know you read these long lists of things or hear them on the
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.240]  commercials from the pharmaceutical companies the antibiotic that she took
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:58.200]  caused her to have a massive stroke as a direct result of that there's also a
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:04.080]  story that's up on info wars today CDC whistleblowers vaccines and autism link
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:11.120]  may be silenced forever we had news breaking last week from it was a
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:17.320]  report from John Rappaport and he was talking about how a particular whistle
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.680]  blower who worked for the CDC was about to go public with a link that the CDC
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.000]  knew of between vaccines and autism and of course a lot of people have been
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.080]  pointing this out there's a lot of information about this but it would be
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.520]  something for actually to have a CDC document he actually named the whistle
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.800]  blower saying it's William W. Thompson PhD but now it looks like after he's been
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.480]  fired it looks like he may also have been silenced so you may want to look at
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:50.480]  that article yet another data point and the link between vaccines and autism
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.920]  stay with us we'll be right back we've got some other breaking news and we've

[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:14.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here in Austin we have a
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.920]  interview that's coming up at the bottom of the hour Alex Jones will be
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.800]  talking to Joe Rogan you don't want to miss that also we're gonna be talking
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:26.040]  in the third hour to Stan Dayo and we're gonna be talking to him about the
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:31.080]  recent increase in seismic activity essentially all over the earth we had
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:38.960]  a 6.1 earthquake in California yesterday we had a 6.9 earthquake in Peru we had
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.280]  Iceland issuing warnings about an imminent volcanic eruption up there so
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.600]  we're gonna talk to him about what's going on with that of course there was a
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:52.400]  news about the western drought they found researchers at Scripps Institute of
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.880]  Oceanography at the University of California San Diego found that they
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:01.440]  could use GPS data to determine the extent of the drought out west especially
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:05.200]  in California it's reached epic proportions there they said that it that
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.520]  when they have water in the ground on the surface of course they can actually
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.080]  measure that's how sensitive the equipment is now they can actually
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:19.400]  measure a difference in the height of the land and they said that the absence
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.360]  of it then causes the land to rise up they said on an average four millimeters
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:28.880]  across the western states they said the Sierra Mountains of California rose over
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:34.560]  half an inch now they pointed out that based on these findings they say that
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:40.400]  the team believes that the water loss due to drought out west exceeds 240 trillion
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:45.800]  liters of water to give you a perspective as to what that is because nobody
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.520]  can really kind of imagine that but they point out it's like covering the
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:53.840]  western half of the United States the western half United States with a layer
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:10:01.040]  of water 10 centimeters deep in other words about four inches so that's the
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:05.040]  amount of water that has disappeared covering the western half of the United
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:10.880]  States with about four inches of water and so these kinds of fluctuations in
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.320]  the water level are perhaps one of the things that's causing some additional
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:19.480]  seismic activity apparently when Obama heard about this earthquake yesterday
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.520]  at the golf course he immediately said that it was not his fault actually it
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.040]  was the the West Napa fault and I guess they're going to rename that now the
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:36.720]  George W. Bush fault but we're gonna be talking to Stan Dayo in the third hour
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.440]  about what's going on all across the world now of course there's other types
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:46.200]  of weather news and that is the global warming there was a geoengineering
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.320]  conference just last week in Berlin and I wanted to get to it last week but we
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.160]  never were able to get to some of the papers and I just wanted to mention this
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:11:00.000]  one particular paper is all we really got time for this is by a guy who's a one
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  of the top climate scientists in terms of references and I found it very
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.560]  interesting that these people are looking at a way to control the temperature
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:13.280]  of the earth because they believe a that there's global warming and b they
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.440]  believe that it is man-made global warming so they think that they can
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:22.840]  how have man-made global cooling and so they talk about engineering the climate
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.800]  themselves and his article his presentation that he had at this
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:34.240]  conference in Berlin said why we should not engineer a global thermostat now he
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:39.440]  starts talking about what is being proposed which is stratospheric aerosol
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:47.080]  injection SAI stratospheric aerosol injection in other words what we would
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.040]  call chemtrails or what some other people have called persistent con trails
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:57.680]  this would essentially be interjecting chemicals into the stratosphere to try
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.720]  to make the earth cloudy to adjust the temperature and of course we've been
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.800]  able to see that type of thing in areas where they do heavy chemtrailing where
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.640]  you see them doing persistent contrails in a grid pattern above areas they can
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.480]  affect a temperature change but they're talking about it in these papers as if
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.520]  it's something that well we are talking about the possibility of doing this but
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.720]  we're not really doing it yet no they're doing it it's the same thing that the
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.680]  NSA did they always want to talk about well you know we're not really listening
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.040]  to you we're not really breaking the law but you know it would be good if we
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.560]  change the law so that we really could monitor you all the time it's always it's
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.600]  not really happening but here's what we are thinking about here's what we're
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.280]  planning on doing but he points out that the risk of putting in stratospheric
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:49.320]  aerosol injection he says is a triple fantasy this guy is actually not in
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.320]  favor of it even though he believes that there's global warming and he believes
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.240]  that it's man-made he's not in favor of geoengineering he says it's a triple
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.400]  fantasy that the risks of climate of changing the climate can be diffused
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.840]  effectively by regulating global temperature he says secondly that the
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.480]  world could ever agree on a level to set the thermostat and third that the
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.400]  unintended consequences of such intervention are manageable in other
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.760]  words he's saying that first of all we don't know if it's going to work
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.240]  secondly we don't know what the consequences are going to be and then
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.680]  thirdly who gets to set the thermostat if we're going to start changing the
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:27.920]  climate of the earth and he points out a couple of interesting analogies he said
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.840]  let's look at experiments he said we always do experiments are entered on
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.760]  entered into because the outcome is not known what's going to happen to
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.760]  patients who get a new drug our crops going to grow faster after we give them
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:45.400]  a new fertilizer he says we're going to just start doing this and we're not
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:49.720]  really going to have a way to test it and that's exactly what I believe they
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.120]  have been doing and many of us have been watching the chemtrail situation of
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.800]  course now I guess we could sound more scientific if we called it stratospheric
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.040]  aerosol injection maybe we just need to change what we call it to get people to
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.840]  take it seriously but he concludes and he says Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.200]  New World can be understood as portraying either a too perfectly
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:15.000]  controlled utopia or a brutal and inhuman dystopia he says I compare Huxley's
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.280]  tale with the vision behind the technology of stratospheric aerosol
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:23.240]  injection and other global sunlight reflection methods in other words are
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:28.160]  we going to try to control this into a utopia or is it going to be a
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:32.240]  dystopian thing and he points out that there's plenty of things that we could
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:39.720]  do to try to make life better on earth just by looking at how governments and
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:43.840]  other institutions are affecting for instance our personal liberty it's a
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.080]  very dangerous path that they're going down and so they're actually in this
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.360]  conference I it was interesting to see that they're debating this but of course
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:56.320]  we believe that they are already are doing it and there's ample evidence that
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.760]  they've been doing it for quite some time now in other news James Clapper's
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.640]  office has declassified yet another set of fully redacted pages if you're
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.360]  watching this I want you to take a look at the screenshot here that they've got
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.200]  to pull this article guys up this is from TechDirt and they show a couple of
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.320]  screenshots here of what is up there and you see at the top it says secret the
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.960]  no foreign no foreign which is no foreign eyes looking at this and if they
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:26.240]  scroll down you see a big two big white boxes then you see a heading that says
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.480]  the banner reads as follows colon and then it's all white it's all redacted
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:36.160]  wouldn't you like to know what's in there I would like to know what they're
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.040]  doing is they're essentially complying with the court order to release these
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:46.560]  documents and so they comply with it in name only by redacting every single bit
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:51.120]  of the document the entire document is blanked out and yet they say they've
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:56.240]  released the document that's the kind of lies and lack of transparency that we
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.560]  see from the NSA from James Clapper from these guys constantly constantly
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:06.000]  working with semantics but they're lying to our face he's not releasing the
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.640]  document if he's got it totally redacted now wouldn't you like to see that
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:15.320]  wouldn't it be interesting if they posted an unredacted copy of these
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:20.120]  documents somewhere on the internet by mistake you know that actually happened
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:26.000]  that actually happened with the TSA we reported on it here at Info Wars we're
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.120]  the only ones who reported on it that actually happened as John Corbett sued
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.680]  them and of course he's the engineer who was exposed the vulnerabilities and the
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.520]  scanning equipment and as part of his lawsuit he was able to review their
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.320]  documents and they mistakenly put the unredacted documents up on Pacer.gov
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.440]  and of course you can see the past articles that Adon Salazar has done
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.640]  we've did reports on the nightly news nobody picked this up the amazing thing
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:59.360]  is is that in the unredacted documents you can see the TSA is saying that there
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:06.200]  is no this is in 2011 the TSA itself wrote that there is no threat against
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.600]  airports or airplanes at the same time they were threatening to shut down all
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:16.360]  air traffic control into Texas because the Texas state legislature had passed
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:20.240]  a bill in the house it was going before the Senate they'd passed a bill
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.320]  nearly unanimously or might have been unanimously saying that they were going
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:29.200]  to put limits on them being able to touch children now we find out in an
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.360]  article that came out last week researchers are easily slipping weapons
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.960]  past the TSA's x-ray body scanners this is an article from Wired Magazine that
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:41.880]  came out the end of last week and they said two years ago a blogger named
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.320]  Jonathan Corbett published a YouTube video that seemed to show a fight a
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.200]  face palm worthy vulnerability in the TSA's rapid scan full-body x-ray
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.320]  scanners because metal detected by the scanners appears to be black and the
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:58.480]  images that they create he claimed that any passenger could hide a weapon on the
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.280]  side of his or her body to render it invisible against the scans black
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:08.240]  background the TSA dismissed his video and they even listen to this they even
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:13.360]  called reporters at all the mainstream media to caution them not to cover this
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:19.120]  video hey if it wasn't true if it wasn't a fault in their system why would they
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:24.120]  not want anybody to know about it now this is what's happened now a team of
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:27.560]  security researchers from the University of California at San Diego the
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:32.280]  University of Michigan and John Hopkins universities have been testing these
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.960]  devices and they're releasing their findings and not only did they find that
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:40.160]  Corbett's weapon hiding tactic worked they also found out they could
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:44.760]  pull off other disturbing lists of possible tricks such as using Teflon
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.800]  tape to conceal weapons against someone's spine installing malware on the
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:53.400]  scanner's console that spoof the scans or simply molding plastic explosives
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:58.400]  around a person's body to make it nearly indistinguishable from flesh in the
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:03.320]  machines images but of course we have to give them carte blanche to touch our
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:08.840]  children to touch us to do anything that they wish at the airports and the
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:14.360]  security at the airports is no better than the security at our border they're
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.600]  just harassing us they're not harassing anybody at the border they're not
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.160]  harassing the people coming into our country of course 100 miles into the
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.120]  border they harass American citizens then saying that it's in the name of
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.720]  checking the border they don't put anybody at the border but they put
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.800]  people a hundred miles in so that they can stop American citizens same thing
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.440]  is happening at the TSA and they point out this they said well it's really
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:39.520]  surprising because they tested these machines presumably without an
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:44.400]  adversarial mindset it's a crony capitalism mindset it was to pay off
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.680]  Michael Chertoff former first director of Homeland Security under George Bush
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.680]  that's why they put the TSA machines in we'll be right back stay with us Joe

[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:20.440]  Knight here in Austin we're going to have alex jones interview with Joe Rogan
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:24.160]  at the bottom of the hour in the next segment actually before we do though in
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.480]  this segment I want to go over some more tech news that came out last week and
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:32.360]  it's not just technology news it's also political news that has a very definite
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.960]  political spin to it just last Monday the federal government started talking
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.600]  about how they want to mandate vehicle to vehicle communication this is a
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:46.240]  national highway traffic safety administration and they want to mandate
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:51.000]  your cars sending radio signals back and forth to each other transmitting data
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.920]  about the car speed the direction the position to other cars that are in the
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:59.960]  same area now it's news to me actually I hadn't noticed this yet but they're going
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:05.480]  to mandate that all new cars have rear view cameras by 2018 as well that's
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.800]  something different that's something else that you're going to wind up paying
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:14.640]  for but this v2v communication is something that you really ought to stop
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.960]  and consider what's going on of course the transportation system is very
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.920]  important to the government as a military logistical aspect to it that's
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.400]  why we have our interstate system our interstate system was enacted after
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:33.680]  World War two and of course it was under President Eisenhower before World War
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:38.520]  two Eisenhower had written essentially it was either a book or a pamphlet about
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.400]  a trip that he took with a large military contingent going from one area of
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:48.000]  the northeast to another area and how difficult it was to move from that one
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.680]  part of the country to the other part of the country because of the road system
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.360]  could not support the military vehicles then of course during World War two they
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:00.000]  got a good look at Hitler's Autobahn and said that's what we need it was sold to
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.320]  the American public essentially as a way as a convenience for our traffic but
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:09.720]  that was really their concern greasing the skids and having a logistical
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.000]  support facilitated by some kind of an autobahn facility that's why Hitler
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.160]  built it that's why the US government built it they want to control transportation
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:25.240]  it's a very important control node for the public and I remember back in the late
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.200]  80s early 90s going to a Rod Raleigh City Council meeting where some city
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:34.240]  counselor had just gone to Russia and she was gushing about the fact that you
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:39.080]  could ride the subways there for just a nickel and we need that kind of
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:42.680]  transportation in this small town and so we've seen this happening over and over
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:46.040]  again that small towns want to get these light rail systems they can get a lot of
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.960]  money from the government but nobody wants to ride them they're not very
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.960]  effective because they're not individualized now they're coming up with
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:59.320]  the what they call self-driving cars I think a better term is robotic cars these
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:04.200]  are not self-driving cars what you have now is a car where you drive yourself
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.960]  what you're going to have is a car that is controlled by computer software that
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.640]  is reporting back to the government and one of the aspects that they're going to
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:16.360]  have with these cars is when they interact with each other trying to
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.360]  correct accident situations and what's going to happen initially is you're
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.560]  going to have some computer driven cars and it's coming very quickly it was just
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:29.480]  back in April that they started talking about how the legislative hurdles are
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.440]  being taken down for testing on the roads in Europe as well as in America and
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.520]  all the car manufacturers want these legislative obstacles taken down so they
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:42.680]  can move forward with their research and do final testing on the highway but it's
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.440]  more than that our government is actually pushing to mandate V2V
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.840]  communication vehicle to vehicle communication think about the problems
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:57.720]  and what can go wrong with that of course that allows hackers to come in and
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:03.160]  communicate that lets anybody look at what you're doing a hacker can break into
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:07.440]  your car then and take over the controls of your car if it's operating that way
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.480]  and of course we've seen that happen with the Internet of Things it wasn't that
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.920]  long ago that General Petraeus was bragging about the fact that your
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:16.640]  toaster oven and your refrigerator are going to be listening to you we've now
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.960]  seen hackers go in and take over refrigerators that were hooked together
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:25.960]  on an Internet of Things within a house system very unsophisticated controls on
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.160]  that they turned them into spam bots that's right spam coming out of your
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.920]  refrigerator but not the kind of spam you eat that's what they can do they can
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:38.760]  be more malicious in this type of thing but they also is an interesting take on
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.800]  this we covered on the nightly news last week about the idea that if the cars are
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:47.480]  talking to each other and working out what's going to happen as a crash is
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.840]  imminent they might start doing some arbitration based on who is in the
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:57.400]  individual cars are they going to drive your car over the side of the cliff
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.960]  because there are more people in the other car than there are in your car or
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.520]  maybe there's younger people in the other car than in your car or maybe
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.920]  there's an insurance equate comes into the equation here maybe the insurance
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.480]  companies are looking at it and saying well send the cheaper car over the
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:20.000]  cliff because we'll have less of a liability in this that we have to pay
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.680]  for a lot of things can happen with it but the main thing is the concern that
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:29.200]  all this information is going to be stored and sent back and controlled by
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:33.080]  the government that they will then monitor everything that you do as we
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.640]  see with the new Corvettes looking at how fast people are accelerating use that
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:43.160]  to raise your insurance rates to drive the few remaining manual drivers out of
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.480]  the out of the business of driving their own cars and have the government
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:51.040]  control all transportation will be right there on the march the empires on the
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:30:02.400]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network I began to get into iodine a few years
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.720]  ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:11.280]  most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:16.400]  iodine is key to so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid I
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:21.120]  discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group you now know it as survival

[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:44.920]  an interview with him talking about essentially the whole spectrum of what's
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:48.160]  going on with current events politics that sort of thing but before we go to
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:51.880]  that interview I want to let you know that this hour of the Alex Jones show is
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.040]  brought to you by Occupower now this is a new product that we have here at

[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:37.240]  who suffered from macular degeneration and the best thing that you can do for
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:41.280]  macular degeneration which is something that occurs to people as they get older
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:46.400]  is nutritional supplements and of course that's exactly what this is
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.040]  addressing the natural function of your eyes it doesn't have to get to the point
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:54.160]  that affects you later in life middle-aged old age of macular degeneration
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.000]  that is something that you can head off with nutritional stuff and it's
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.400]  something that you can really help with nutritional support from the foundation
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:08.360]  that that covers that that is their number one prescription is to address it
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:14.280]  nutritionally because your retinas are constantly replenishing the cells are
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.920]  dying and it's constantly being replenished so you need the right kind
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:21.600]  of nutrients that's what you'll find in occupier get it now before it runs out
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.080]  it's going to take another six to eight weeks to refresh it let's go to this
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.760]  interview that Alex Jones had with Joe Rogan as I mentioned they basically
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:33.360]  cover the waterfront on a variety of subjects when Joe Rogan was here just
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.240]  last week in Austin
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:50.080]  it was about six and a half years ago Obama was president-elect and I sat in
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:54.800]  here in this very green room in the cap city comedy club Joe that videos would
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:59.200]  see about 40 million times now it's ridiculous literally like 14 million
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:04.120]  just one spot on YouTube that's ridiculous you early on when everybody
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.760]  else was saying Obama was the savior you weren't saying you were for the
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:11.000]  Democrat or the Republican I'm gonna play a clip right now you were saying
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.880]  why does anybody expect him to be any different and it was like right when he
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:19.400]  was president-elect or right when he got it off it's pretty obvious that there's
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.840]  some gigantic financial institutions that have been pulling the strings of
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:27.240]  politicians in this country for a long time and that that's the fact that we
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.120]  have it set up where they can donate millions of dollars to these guys funds
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:36.480]  these guys campaigns I mean how do we not expect it all to go bad they put so
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.600]  much into him built him up as his big brand name what's your take on well you
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.600]  know what man I don't even think Obama is to blame I really don't I don't think
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:49.680]  there's an individual that's to blame I think that what we're looking at and I'm
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:55.400]  obviously no political expert by any means but as a person who's observing a
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:02.280]  system who's a person who's observing this strange society that we live in and
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:07.920]  how it's influenced by money and corporations and how politicians are
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:11.640]  beholden to so many different groups before they get into any positions of
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:17.040]  power it's incredibly difficult to change anything and it's not like this
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:23.440]  this this this statement about Obama as a president or Bob as a person it's more
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:30.040]  that the system is so intertangled it's so intertwined with political interest
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:36.360]  groups and with lobbyists and with corporations having mad control over the
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:41.360]  political system over who gets who who gets represented which party you know
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:46.400]  who represents which party the people that have the most money historically
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:50.600]  have done the best I mean it's it's like a big crazy money grab and then these
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:55.320]  people getting these positions of power and I don't think they have nearly as
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:00.520]  much control as we like to think they do and I think he gets into this position
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:07.520]  of power and I think it's probably just a melee in there a melee of money and
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:13.720]  lobbyists and military industrial complex and influence of foreign leaders
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:20.160]  and chaos and threats of terrorism Jesus Christ I mean can you imagine that
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.720]  guy's job it's an impossible job it's an impossible job for any person for any
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:30.600]  person Freddy one person to try to turn this crazy ship around so I didn't have
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.800]  any faith in his ability to do it but I bet nobody can do that job I think that
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:40.280]  job is almost impossible it's almost impossible to be some person who's gonna
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:45.240]  make everybody happy and who's also going to make all of your all the people
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:48.920]  that got you into power happy and then make the the culture well that's a true
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:54.240]  story what's in the movie Nixon with Oliver Stone that he produced where
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:59.000]  Nixon goes out to the memorial at night and then all the anti-war folks come up
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.600]  to him and all the anti-nixon people he goes look it's a big beast a big machine
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:07.440]  I can't stop it I think that seems that I mean I think the beast that Nixon faced
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:12.360]  was probably still way too big for anybody to handle but I think that the
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:18.240]  beast Obama faces is far bigger it's far crazier it's the whole thing it's just
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:24.080]  and it's it is the stakes are higher because because the wars we're in are
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:29.800]  so preposterous after Vietnam there's this sort of despair that happens when
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:34.080]  people realize like we didn't learn anything like we didn't learn anything
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:39.080]  we're still involved in quagmires and other countries that cost massive
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:44.760]  massive amounts of lives both Americans and other people we get caught in these
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:48.600]  things and they're incredibly disappointing for people they look at
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:53.280]  our culture I think America likes to be a proud country we like to look at
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:40:00.600]  ourselves as as really like a special type of people we're the the children of
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:04.600]  immigrants the crazy people that came here when everybody else was banking on
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:08.240]  Europe we were like let's get on a boat and hundreds of years ago those were
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:12.960]  our ancestors and this is where we are today but if you look at our actions it's
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:18.320]  it's depressing for people to look at the actions of their country and not
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:23.460]  totally be able to defend something that we've done militarily you know when
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:26.160]  people look at that and they go I don't you know there's a lot of people that I
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.360]  know that are patriots a lot of people that I know that are veterans that love
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:34.960]  America that believe in the military and they're very upset with the way the
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:40.280]  direction of these wars has gone very upset with the the the image that it's
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:47.160]  given America worldwide you know this is the famous point that many people had
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:53.320]  right after September 11th was this is an incredible time where there was so
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:57.120]  much sympathy of these other nations there was they were so on the side of
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.120]  America that America had been attacked this is horrible the whole world was
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:07.040]  watching and within a period of a few years our actions were so up that we
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:11.520]  lost all that sympathy we'd like there was this this moment where America had
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:16.160]  this position of love you know where the whole world was like hey we're sorry
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:21.400]  that happened to you and by by the actions the mistakes those are pushed
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:27.000]  the pull whatever it was that led us from September 11 2001 to where we are in
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.600]  2014 whatever it is that led us to that it bums a lot of people out you know
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:37.560]  where does your gut tell you the country's going because so many people
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:42.480]  that the metric show towards some type of collapse not just here but worldwide
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.560]  I know you personally have been moving towards getting off the grid some well
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.080]  I think getting off the grid is a good idea just because the grid is goofy if
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.600]  you could figure out a way to make you on electricity and get your own water out
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:55.480]  of the ground like why would you why would you not do that as long as you're
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:58.920]  testing your water and you know that your water is good it just seems awesome
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:03.160]  it seems like a cool thing to be able to get your electricity from the sun but
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:08.360]  I don't think necessarily civilization is going to collapse I think people far
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:15.520]  smarter than me have engineered this thing I just think that we're you know
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.480]  we're just in a weird period of life we're also in a weird period of
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:23.760]  information it's a weird period of like the news you know this Edward Snowden
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.480]  stuff the you know Glenn Greenwald and the ability to distribute a big crazy
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:34.320]  story like that it's completely shifted it's not only like the New York Times
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:39.000]  it's not only like a corporation it's small individuals have this weird
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.280]  ability to do stuff like that now like world-changing stuff and it's almost
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:49.920]  like a presingularities like smaller waves building up to bigger waves yeah I
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:53.720]  mean that's how I knew about the NSA on the hubs in the major building
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.560]  so everyone in 1999 I'd be telling you about that stuff and how they were
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:00.920]  listening to everything dude you thought that you thought they were spying on
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:05.680]  everything way before anybody did but I'm not to my horn I didn't I was it
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:08.800]  psychic yeah but it's not just that it was in the documents there's also who had
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:13.080]  the documents you have the documents one thing that I always tell everybody like
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:19.360]  the first the first video that I ever saw that made me go why they do that
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:26.120]  that's real was your 9-1-1 road to tyranny documentary where you detailed
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:31.120]  what happened in the World Trade Organization oh yeah the WTO protests
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:36.520]  we detailed how they use these guys to come in these agent provocateurs they
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:40.560]  were there's a peaceful protest in order to make it non-peaceful they have these
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.560]  guys coming with government issue boots ski masks fuck everything up smash
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:49.040]  things and then they turn it into like war zones and the cops get to move in
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:53.320]  and arrest everybody they made the whole thing a no-protest zone these guys they
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:58.160]  would hold up in some house somewhere right and they have a paper house and
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:03.200]  then negotiated them free they got free so these guys like smashed all these
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.360]  windows and they had the Delta Force running that even came out I mean people
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:10.480]  in Seattle knew about that I was being called a conspiracy theorist just because
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:15.160]  I had the local newspapers from there it sounds so crazy if someone tells you
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:19.840]  that you go that's crazy but then you find out that is actually a tactic that
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:25.040]  gets used to break up protests like they'll hire someone I don't know with
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:29.520]  what account but the same type of account they use you know some some
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:34.720]  something that doesn't have to be you know doesn't have to be how would you
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:37.560]  how would you organize something like that how do you tell somebody well they
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.840]  allowed to say hey oh we're gonna hire you guys
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:46.560]  well that's the report from the interview with Alex Jones and Joe Rogan
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:51.100]  that is now up on our YouTube channel so check that out we're gonna have an
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:54.720]  extended version of that going up in the next day or so that'll be up on
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:00.120]  YouTube interesting to hear Joe Rogan talking about how it was Alex Jones that
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:04.680]  first woke him up first time he's like a whoa moment you know when he saw one of
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:09.040]  Alex Jones's documentaries and that's something that you can pass on to other
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:14.440]  people with a membership to Prison Planet TV it lets you not only see our
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:18.240]  nightly news every night but it lets you have access to all of Alex's
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.560]  documentaries and share that with other people 11 of you can watch it
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:26.480]  simultaneously so it's one way that you can support our operation and wake
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.840]  people up maybe it'll be somebody like Joe Rogan who knows and we were talking
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:35.000]  just before the break and just before the interview about what's happening to
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.520]  our transportation we're going to see a massive revolution and transportation in
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:43.040]  just the next few years most people believe that it's going to happen within
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:48.600]  the next six years that we're going to see driverless cars or as they like to
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.560]  call them self-driving cars no actually they're going to be robotic cars they're
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:55.240]  going to be computer driven cars that are going to be passing and recording a
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:00.160]  lot of information on to the government on to insurance companies and it's going
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:06.200]  to radically change our lives a lot of people are now currently working as
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:09.920]  drivers in one capacity of other whether it's about it as a taxi driver
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:14.560]  whether it's a truck driver all of those people's jobs are going to be in
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:19.600]  jeopardy once we go to self-driving automobiles or robotic cars and trucks
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:22.960]  one of the ways you can see this happening one of the ways that big
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:27.680]  brother is moving and of course is going to be with all kinds of recordings
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:32.320]  about black box type of recordings about what you're doing and not just for the
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:36.680]  sake of an accident one of the first places we see this happening is from
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.280]  the story by the LA Times at the end of last week a new Corvette will record
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.040]  every move that a valet driver makes and they're talking about the fact that
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:49.320]  you're going to now have an option with new Corvettes it's about an $1800 add-on
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.640]  option and of course all this technology is going to make cars a lot more
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.920]  expensive of course but anyway for $1800 now you can get something so that when
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:01.880]  you turn the keys over to somebody in the park your car you can know if they
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:06.840]  went joyriding in it it's going to record data like speed engine rpm which
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:10.640]  gears were used even the highest level of g-forces incurred it's also going to
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:14.960]  have a video recording from the driver's perspective recording on a high
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:19.440]  definition camera you'll be able to watch it inside the car you'll be able to
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:25.400]  take it out on a card now last Monday the federal transportation officials
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:29.160]  began drafting regulations for cars to start communicating with each other
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:33.360]  electronically and as I point out in the LA Times that's going to pave the way
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:39.720]  for a hundred percent monitoring of all vehicle activity you see it's not just
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:44.200]  going to be for Corvette owners who want to monitor their valet that's the way
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:47.120]  they're going to sell it initially that's the way they're rolling this
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:50.800]  technology out know what they're going to do is they're going to record all
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:53.720]  this information and they're going to pass it on maybe they'll watch you
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:58.640]  constantly to get you to the point where you won't be able to self-drive your car
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.920]  maybe they'll watch you constantly in the minute you go one mile an hour over
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:06.200]  the speed limit it'll report it to the highway patrol that'd be one way to get
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:09.480]  you out of your car pretty quickly wouldn't it maybe they'll report the
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:12.760]  fact that you're pulling too many G's as you're going around the corner maybe
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:17.800]  they'll report that to the insurance company but the biggest concern is what's
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:21.520]  going to happen with this vehicle to vehicle communication if you're in a
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:25.440]  situation where there's an accident and as I pointed out we talked about this on
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.840]  the nightly news last week an article from Wired magazine talking about the
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:35.840]  ethics and the ethics settings in a robotics car now they say perhaps you've
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:40.040]  got an accident coming and the cars start talking to each other about what
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:44.200]  they're going to do how they're going to handle this accident if somebody has to
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:48.480]  be sacrificed who are they going to sacrifice what kind of liability does
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:52.840]  this then create for the automobile companies well of course one of the ways
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:56.960]  that they can back out of that liability is by giving you control over the
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.880]  ethical settings are you going to work out that you value your life over all
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.520]  other lives and other cars or are you going to say that you want the cars to
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:10.320]  work out and minimize the overall total loss of life or maybe you'll do
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:15.360]  something like set it up so that whoever is younger maybe they can determine
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:20.640]  that by the weight of the people in the car who knows the issue is is that you're
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:25.800]  turning a lot of control over the cars as Google is now has prototypes that
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:31.680]  they're running in various areas have no steering wheel have no brakes it's not
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:35.400]  the sort of situation that they're assisting you I'm all for assisting
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:40.440]  people if it's if it can be controlled and kept under control of course many of
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:47.880]  us believe that that was possibly a way that people can be suicided or killed
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:52.720]  by accident if somebody hacks into your car and let's say they control the
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:57.840]  steering because now we have cars that are capable of staying within a lane if
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:02.640]  they're in cruise control mode also making sure that they keep the
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:06.360]  appropriate distance between them and the car in front of them if they're in
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:10.760]  cruise control mode so there's a lot of control that is gradually being turned
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:16.000]  over but that's going to turn into a tsunami they're removing legal limits
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.560]  and they're going to start requiring that we buy this extra equipment for
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:23.160]  vehicle-to-vehicle communication as I pointed out in the last segment if you
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:28.400]  know anything about what's happening in the internet of things where they have
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:31.800]  appliances and smart homes talking to each other how easily those things are
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:35.320]  hacked whether it's a refrigerator whether it's your intelligent light bulbs
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:39.240]  that is something you should be very concerned about but I'm very concerned
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:43.920]  about the fact that the government would have total control over our
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:49.720]  transportation look at what they've done at the airports do you really want that
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:54.720]  to happen on the highways and they're working it out gradually bringing it on
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:58.600]  should be aware that stay on top of it we'll be right back

[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:24.360]  be talking to Stan Dayo in the next hour and he's gonna be talking to us
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:29.320]  about the recent increase in earthquakes now over the weekend besides the San
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:37.000]  Francisco earthquake we also had a scare about the Iceland volcano volcano named
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.780]  Bardar Bunga if I'm pronouncing that correctly at first on Saturday the
[01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:47.000]  Icelandic meteorological office said that the volcano had experienced a
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.680]  subglacial eruption and that there were earthquakes going on there they raised
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:56.600]  it to a red alert on Sunday then they have now lowered it to a level orange
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:00.720]  alert and they point out if you might remember this is just about four years
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:06.520]  ago 2010 there was an eruption of another volcano which I have no way of
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:10.720]  pronouncing that so we'll just go to Iceland volcano it caused a week of
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.320]  international aviation chaos more than 100,000 flights were canceled it
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:20.600]  affected more than 10 million people it cost 1.7 billion dollars and aviation
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:25.680]  officials close Europe's airspace for five days out of fear that volcanic ash
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:30.160]  could harm jet engines now they're saying that if this new volcano were to
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:35.120]  erupt it would not necessarily produce a high ash column like that one did so
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:39.080]  the likelihood of interruption of transatlantic and European air travel they
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:43.080]  said remains low they're still concerned about road restrictions in the area and
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:46.840]  this is something that we've seen in Yellowstone as well we've seen in
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:52.640]  Yellowstone that there has been a movement in the underground collection
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:57.880]  the magma the lava underneath the ground it has swelled it's concerned them we've
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:02.760]  also had a road get melted in Yellowstone and of course Yellowstone Iceland
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:07.200]  and around that area as well as New Zealand are three areas in the world
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.320]  where they have this kind of geothermal activity that's right near the surface and
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:17.920]  of course Yellowstone is by far and away bigger than Rotorua and New Zealand
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:23.000]  and the volcanoes in Iceland it's even larger at Yellowstone if that thing
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.240]  blows is that people have pointed out many times that is something that's
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:31.480]  going to affect virtually all the United States it could take out several
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:37.880]  states if that volcano that ancient volcano were to erupt now just in San
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:42.200]  Francisco alone they're saying that this is the US geological service is saying
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:47.800]  that there is a 54% chance of a magnitude 5.0 quake in the Bay Area
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.880]  within the next seven days as an aftershock now there's been 30 to 70
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:59.640]  smaller aftershocks that are between a magnitude of 3 and 5 are also expected
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:04.800]  and they've had quite a few small aftershocks but so far nothing very
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:09.360]  large has happened that I'm aware of but we're going to be talking in the next
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:15.800]  hour as I mentioned to Stan Dayo he is someone who is an expert on very many
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:20.360]  topics he's got secret clearance he worked on black projects and a
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:26.920]  government UFO project to create special secret weapons and he also is very
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:31.720]  interested in earthquakes Alex Jones had him on the radio show back in April so
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:35.840]  just four months ago he was talking about the increase in earthquake activity
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:43.680]  and as I pointed out in the last hour we had an article we got an article up
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:48.520]  today from Michael Snyder talking about the increase in earthquake activity and
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:52.280]  why this is just the beginning he had a very interesting article last Thursday
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:56.800]  on the 21st where he was talking about the fact that just in the first three
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:00.400]  months of this year there was more than double the yearly average annual of
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:05.720]  earthquakes that we've had since 1979 and the number of earthquakes in Central
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:10.760]  and US Eastern US has quintupled in recent years yet an interesting story
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:14.520]  we're going to cover that right after the break about what's going on on the
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:20.000]  new Madrid fault now the new Madrid fault is not in Spain it's in the central
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.400]  part of the United States and their large holes that are forming and we've
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:28.080]  got an interesting story about a young man who is nearly buried alive because
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:30.680]  one of those holes stay with us we're going to be right back and we're going
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:35.080]  to have stand-out with us you're right back

[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:29.960]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we're gonna be
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:33.400]  talking in this hour to stand day oh he's gonna be joining us in the next
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:38.120]  segment he's someone who's had above top top secret security clearance he's
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:42.720]  worked undercover for the FBI he was part of an exclusive black project
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:47.360]  specializing in development of flying saucer technology in his background and
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:51.440]  his interests include earthquake forecasting so we're gonna have him on
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:56.200]  to talk about what's going on there's an article up on info wars calm today
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:00.880]  why the earthquake near San Francisco is just the start of the shaking in
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:05.560]  California this is by Michael Snyder and he points out that approximately 81% of
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:10.160]  all big earthquakes occur along the ring of fire which is an area of perimeter
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:13.700]  that extends down in the Pacific of course we've seen many times what
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:17.240]  happens in the Pacific as there's an offshore earthquake creating a giant
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:22.720]  tsunami devastating consequences it's not just the direct effect of earthquakes
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:27.040]  themselves now Michael Snyder is also following this earthquake situation
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:30.720]  pretty closely and he had an article just last Thursday talking about large
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:34.040]  holes that were forming near the new Madrid fault and as I pointed out the
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:38.800]  new Madrid fault is not in Spain but it actually lies on the border region of
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:44.760]  Illinois Indiana Missouri Arkansas Kentucky Tennessee and Mississippi and he
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:49.200]  says that in May this is his article from last Thursday in May the federal
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:53.600]  government simulated an earthquake that was so massive it killed 100,000
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:58.040]  Midwesterners instantly and forced more than seven million people out of their
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:05.680]  homes now does that sound over the top he points out that they had a replay it
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:10.280]  was actually a replay of a disaster that happened 200 years ago on December
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:16.640]  16th 1811 a magnitude 7.7 earthquake hit the new Madrid fault line which is in
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:21.160]  the area that I just mentioned today there are 15 million people who live
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:25.280]  there back then there were hardly anybody living there and yet people who
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:29.960]  were on the Mississippi River saw boats flung all over the place it was
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:35.240]  devastating for the few people that were there and that was a magnitude 7.7
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:39.800]  earthquake now why they believe that that could be happening sometime in the
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:43.960]  near future well he points out the same fault this new Madrid fault they said
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:49.240]  more than a year after a six-year-old boy was almost buried alive in a popular
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:54.560]  sand dune more holes are now appearing on this fault in a place called Mount
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:03:00.560]  Baldy in Indiana it's a 126 foot sand dune now they're closed they've closed
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.560]  access to that area because of the holes that are there and three geologists
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:08.040]  arrived last week with high tech equipment hoping to use radio waves and
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:12.800]  core samples to see if they can determine what's causing the holes this is
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:16.760]  something that we're seeing happening in many different areas as I also pointed
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:22.840]  out GPS locating equipment showed a four millimeter drop in western states due
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:26.800]  to the drought they could actually see that kind of a drop from the satellite
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:32.880]  measurements they've seen that Yellowstone is actually heaving up with
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:38.920]  lava underneath the surface so we see that the water that has evap that is now
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:42.720]  evaporated with a drought or gone because the drought ground water surface
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:46.400]  water has caused the surface to actually go down and yet in other areas like
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:53.760]  Yellowstone we see it moving up slightly as the underground volcanic lava is
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:58.560]  building up in those areas so there's a lot of seismic changes that are going
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:06.400]  on and in San Francisco they got a 10 second warning maybe you want to do
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:10.920]  something to prepare before you get a 10 second warning so we're going to be
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:18.680]  talking to stand out about what's going on try to get an idea of what really the
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:22.800]  landscaping is quite literally and get a feel for where your risk are you may
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:26.400]  not think that it's going to affect you if you live in the eastern part of the
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:29.440]  United States you may think this is something that only people in California
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:33.400]  should be concerned about and yet that's not the case we see this is
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:36.960]  happening in multiple areas so we're going to be talking to him right after
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:58.920]  the break stay with us we'll be right back

[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:06.120]  helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxified most people know
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:11.880]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world iodine is key to so
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:16.280]  many of the body's functions especially the thyroid I discovered a product being
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:21.640]  developed by Dr. Group you now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:25.520]  that your body can really absorb then about a year ago he said listen if you
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:30.120]  think this is powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth deep earth crystals
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:35.440]  and the results that I personally have had have been life-changing nobody else
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:40.280]  has got iodine based on these pure crystals ladies and gentlemen this is

[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:26.200]  resistance it's alex jones
[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:32.920]  welcome back to the alex jones show I'm David Knight and Austin we're going to
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:38.520]  be talking to Stan Dale about the recent earthquakes this last weekend and what
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:42.920]  he sees coming up ahead because we had him on it just about four months ago and
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:45.840]  he's predicting an increase in earthquakes that's exactly what we saw this
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:51.520]  weekend we saw 6.1 in San Francisco we saw 6.9 in Peru we saw warnings about an
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:56.680]  earthquake and our volcanic volcanic eruption in Iceland and of course
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:09:00.760]  there's been a lot of concern about Yellowstone we see the ground rising
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:06.040]  there we see a road being melted down and closed so there's a lot of changes
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:10.760]  geological and seismic changes that are going on and it's not just in the
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:13.680]  political area of course before we go to him I want to point out you know it's
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:17.320]  not just natural disasters that can take us down of course there's also the
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:21.080]  economic collapse that we talk about constantly and there's a article up on
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:24.800]  info wars.com do you want milk or toilet paper well the Venezuelan government
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:30.120]  wants your fingerprints they're saying that the president Maduro has announced
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:34.080]  this week that'll be just the end of last week that the grocery stores will
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:39.880]  soon begin mandatory fingerprinting of customers this particular initiative
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:43.400]  which could be implemented by the end of the year is meant to help combat the
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:48.120]  hoarding and the smuggling of government subsidized goods so see that's right if
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:51.760]  they give you all this stuff then they're going to fingerprint you and
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:55.000]  they're going to track you to make sure that you're not getting too much of it
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.540]  I think it's interesting that it wasn't that long ago that Bloomberg had an
[02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:05.520]  article saying that it was a good investment for bankers and bondholders
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:09.760]  to invest in Venezuela that they had been getting just under 700% return on
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:15.560]  investment and they had a banker at the time say this is wonderful because the
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:19.840]  Hugo Chavez as well as the current government understands that their first
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.480]  responsibility is their sovereign debt and in the context of that article they
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:28.680]  were talking about how at the time people could not get food and water
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:32.600]  without going to neighboring countries and now they're trying to crack down even
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:37.200]  more on them in this socialist utopia that's what happens and I think it's
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:40.520]  interesting when you look at this and the fact that they will let their people
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:45.480]  starve they will fingerprint them before they give them any food and track them
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:49.840]  to see who's getting what amount of food they will do that to their own people
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:55.480]  but they will pay the bankers first maybe that's why the West never attacked
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:11:00.760]  militarily Hugo Chavez because he was taking care of the bankers maybe that
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:05.600]  was what kept him safe well let's go to stand a right now I want to talk to him
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:10.160]  about earthquakes as I said he was on back in April talking to Alex Jones
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:16.160]  San Diego is has held above top secret clearance he's worked undercover for the
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:20.080]  FBI he's part of an exclusive black project that was specializing
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:24.320]  development of flying saucer technology he has a very diverse background he's
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:27.680]  interested and knowledgeable about computer programming marine architecture
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:32.600]  advanced propulsion engineering biblical studies and earthquake forecasting
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:40.400]  stand a thank you for joining us thank you for the invite David you're are you an 80 texan no
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:46.080]  I'm not I'm actually spent most my life in North Carolina that's good to see you
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:52.880]  there anyway yeah I'm a recent transplant good stuff yeah earthquakes there's a
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:12:00.440]  lot of changes going on in the the planet they're a little bit I don't know
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:04.080]  schizophrenic I think it'd be the word I want to use because they seem to ramp up
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:08.560]  and then they back off and jump another place I'm looking at the map of the
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:15.160]  earthquakes today on USGS and we're seeing as we have been for probably three
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:20.200]  or four weeks now some significant wakes quakes you know four four plus four
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:27.960]  four point five plus over in Greece Turkey around Iraq and up in Iceland of
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:31.800]  course you know about that under the volcanoes up there and then in another
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:36.920]  place down close to the South Pole off the tip of South America these indicate
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:43.960]  to me that the Atlantic side of things is relieving stress in a big way I'm
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:51.320]  still not sure what's going to happen up at the the bar to bar our bung volcano
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:56.080]  in Iceland mm-hmm all the evidence we've got does show that there's quite a bit
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:59.600]  of earthquake activity deep underneath which means it still hasn't approached
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:04.000]  the surface yet even though you know people are saying to watch out when you
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:10.080]  fly over there and that kind of stuff so I you know it's the woman in San
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:15.360]  Francisco you know that area of the quakes there that is a little bit
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:20.160]  unusual as you know in that area there gosh it's been like one and a half
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:24.560]  million years or more since the Franklin Fault was active it's not even the one
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:28.640]  that that caused the great you know 1900 and some odd earthquake there it's a
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:32.680]  different fault okay I did you know that okay yeah yeah and well there does it
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:37.720]  mean Andreas or no no San Andreas will probably trigger things that area should
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:44.000]  it have a large quake and and certainly north of there in them off the coast of
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:50.800]  Oregon and Washington State there's a series of plate fractures there in the
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:54.760]  Juan de Fuca plate then two main pieces in the bottom part we just touch this
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:58.720]  northern California just right above where this earthquake occurred now if
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:03.960]  the Juan de Fuca plate does release and it's overdue probably six years overdue
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:09.080]  now but they figured that it would do within 56 years you know back in the
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:14.760]  high GY year 1958 if you look at all the other areas around the great ring of
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:17.760]  fire in the Pacific that were under stress like that they've all released
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:21.440]  they're you know Richard eights and nines this is the only holdout on the
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:27.800]  whole Pacific ring of fire our arch of fire is now called now if that goes
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:34.640]  it'll be a nine point two or three plus wow wow and I that will shake the
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:39.160]  dickens out of the west coast and it'll it'll trigger Franklin it'll trigger you
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:43.240]  know San Andreas and it's probably about 15 other parallel faults it'll trigger
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.360]  as well wow wow that's huge because as everybody knows these Richter scale
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:53.520]  measurements are exponential so there's a huge difference between a six and a
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:57.520]  seven and between a what they just had was a six in San Francisco you're
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:01.960]  talking about a nine what is that a thousand times that's about that's
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:06.200]  about right yeah yeah man man that's amazing that would jar your teeth a bit
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:11.760]  yeah yeah absolutely now you're talking about some activity in the Atlantic now
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:15.440]  there was also an article that I was reading from from last Thursday Michael
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:21.920]  Snyder was talking about the new Madrid fault that runs through central United
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:25.440]  States through Illinois Indiana Missouri Arkansas Kentucky Tennessee and
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:31.200]  Mississippi he says yeah what do you know about that well fair amount of
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:36.560]  actually on our website there under the show images page and your producer we
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:40.800]  talked about this earlier you can link into that and look at a number of maps
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:46.280]  and images I've got even some stereo 3d things related to the new Madrid fault
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:53.480]  it is a peculiar kind of fault system it's like little rectangular honeycombs
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:16:00.560]  underneath there it is a failed attempt to form a ridge like occurred in the
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:06.080]  the middle of the Atlantic and as such it had dynamic pressures from several
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:12.280]  sides and so it's a very kind of unpredictable type of fault we know
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:18.280]  that every 175 to 180 years we get a major release there and certainly we're
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:23.680]  seeing signs at this time not only will it release in the you know southern
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:27.880]  Missouri Tennessee area it will probably release in a fault connecting
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:32.240]  through Arkansas all the way over to Oklahoma City wow and this is you know
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:37.040]  still up for conjecture but on our on our website on the show images page where
[02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:46.240]  I talk about these kind of things I do have a map showing well the the safe
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:53.480]  zone if you wish of well earthquakes it will occur in Canada and the United
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:57.440]  States all the way down to Central America now it's called the central
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:03.720]  stable region a shield and there's a black line if you go down oh gosh let's
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:07.160]  see I mean let me tell you where it is it's on the show images page down a
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:10.880]  fifth row down on the right and it's a white like a white image and again your
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:17.320]  website is a stan dayo.com that's a stand de y.o.com where people can see
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:20.840]  these images and and see what you've mapped out here and that's right they
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:23.800]  just click the button next to the microphone says show images and go down
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:29.200]  the fifth row and on the right now this this tells us it's a very rare piece of
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:34.520]  graphic data I got on this but where there's a black line that comes down
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:39.240]  between the West Coast United States and goes on the other side of the Rockies
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:43.720]  and down into Central Texas down around where you are and around and up into
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:47.440]  Tennessee to the bottom of the new Madrid fault line then all the way up into
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:52.520]  the Appalachians and you know out now that black line outside of that black
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:56.840]  line toward the oceans everywhere is where we have instabilities in the
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:18:02.400]  Earth's crust should a major earthquake series start the Colorado Plateau is
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:06.040]  exempt from that it's also within a little shielded area but other than that
[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:13.480]  on that map you will see that you know Mexico Arizona California Washington
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:19.200]  Idaho Oregon Florida Louisiana Mississippi all around the east coast and
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:23.360]  and the south coast and the west coast are at risk for major earthquake
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:31.320]  activity should that start soon on that same page you can see historically the
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:37.080]  where you know earthquakes are occurring across the United States and
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:42.120]  where fracking has been occurring I've got quite a detailed set of data on the
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:47.800]  new Madrid thing as well it's on site there fracking we've had a lot of
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:52.800]  earthquakes where people are in Texas there's been a rapid increase in
[02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:57.440]  earthquakes they that believe is due to fracking do you share that belief well
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:01.720]  if you look at the fracking map I've got we see all the little green dots on it
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:05.880]  there that's to the left of that one we're just looking at and it shows a
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:12.120]  huge concentration of them in the south southeast portion of Texas from the
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:16.840]  two of Texas all the way across up into Louisiana and part of Mississippi so
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:20.400]  there's a high correlation to where they're fracking and where these rapid
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:28.240]  earthquakes are happening that's right that's right the excuse me go ahead and
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:34.400]  get that and and also when we were talking about this earlier we were
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:39.280]  talking about the fact that the US Geological Service could see the effects
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:43.360]  of drought from their satellites across the western United States so we'll be
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:46.480]  right back when we continue talking about what's going on with this and we're
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:50.160]  also going to talk about what you can do to prepare when to give you more than a
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:53.920]  10-second warning to prepare like the people in California did of course they
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:57.960]  expected it to come but there are other places other than California United
[02:19:57.960 --> 02:20:02.000]  States that are susceptible to earthquakes to our soils to the
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:06.720]  atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:10.760]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:14.560]  two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and
[02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:19.000]  most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.240]  their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well
[02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:27.160]  over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and
[02:20:27.160 --> 02:20:30.360]  don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:33.920]  allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics it was clear
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:38.600]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic

[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:16.440]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and I'm talking to Stan
[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:23.320]  Dayo of Stan Dayo dot com that's S-T-A-N-E-Y-O dot com I mentioned that
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:28.120]  because you can go to his website as we've been talking here about his
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:31.320]  website and showing it for the people who are watching this you can see some
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:36.760]  very detailed graphical data showing where these fault lines are many people
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:40.600]  think this is something that really only affects California or San Francisco in
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:44.200]  the United States or maybe it affects Pacific Islands where they they have a
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:49.120]  earthquake off the coast they have to worry about tsunamis coming in we have
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:53.680]  all those problems here as well and there are some faults within the United
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:59.840]  States that maybe you're not aware of that have are long overdue for some kind
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:05.200]  of activity but just before we went to a commercial break Stan had brought up
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:09.360]  fracking and I want to go over that a little bit more with him because he's
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:13.480]  got a chart on his site that shows a pretty high correlation between fracking
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:18.760]  activity and earthquakes in Oklahoma Texas other places we know that there's
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:24.080]  been a massive amount of water lost in the western United States due to drought
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:30.800]  as a matter of fact it's so much that it's the equivalent to about four inches
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:34.600]  of water covering the entire western half of the United States that is basically
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:38.280]  missing now due to this drought of epic proportions they determined that by
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:45.920]  looking at the ground sinking because it doesn't have the changes in the height
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:51.880]  of the ground because actually rising because the lack of presence of the
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:55.600]  water which would normally take it down so they were able to measure a four
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:26:02.160]  millimeter difference in the height of the ground and basically extrapolate
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:06.560]  from that the amount of water that was missing Dan let's a stand let's talk
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:13.000]  about the correlation between changes in groundwater level it's not just the
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.240]  plates that are building up tension but it's also things that might be naturally
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:20.440]  occurring or things that we are doing that are man-made that are changing the
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:25.080]  groundwater and affecting earthquakes well certainly depending upon the
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:30.840]  formation underneath say California where the water has been stored it takes
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:35.040]  maybe a hundred years to recharge some of those aquifers down there and if you
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:40.200]  use it up quickly with agriculture like in the San Joaquin Valley you might
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:45.440]  find that it that the emptiness doesn't go away real quickly it doesn't fill up
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:51.320]  again and this makes a mechanical instability with the the weight of
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:58.680]  water that's firmly above it and with a you know human activity there down in
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:02.360]  Lake Tampa with the North Island of New Zealand is another situation where water
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:07.440]  level in a lake is very important because it holds down the lid on a huge
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:14.000]  caldera as big as Yellowstone and right right now of course that the water is
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.880]  warm and there's steam coming up on the shore occasionally if that one goes it
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:23.520]  will be because probably because the weight of the water has been reduced you
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:28.120]  know by they've been using geothermal sources and with the drought hitting all
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:33.840]  over the world all these areas are subject to danger in California
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:38.560]  particularly I think that what's going to happen there is it because the the
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:43.800]  underground water storage is not like a flat level thing it has you know like
[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:48.360]  waves in it underneath in the sedimentary formations that have been kind of
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:54.760]  you know squeezed together we might see the evidence of the California is
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:59.960]  separating into small islands as this progresses over the years it can happen
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:05.480]  suddenly but it may also happen over a period of a decade or two if we don't
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:09.280]  get rain in there to recharge and as I said it takes about a hundred years to
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:14.120]  recharge the main aquifers well in situations not going to go away it's
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:19.840]  it's not good that's very interesting now you were also talking about fracking and
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:26.000]  I had read in the break just before you came on from Michael Snyder's article
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.040]  where he's talking about these holes that were opening up on Mount Baldy which
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:34.600]  is near the New Madrid or New Madrid fault do you think that's something that
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:37.360]  they don't really know what's going on there there's speculation about that do
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:42.000]  you think that's related somehow to changes in water levels or do you think
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:49.720]  that's something to do with plates it's to do I think primarily with the same
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:53.080]  phenomenon is causing a lot of the sinkholes all around the world not just
[02:28:53.080 --> 02:29:00.960]  the in the United States there was a down near I guess Sonora in Mexico just
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:07.080]  part of the Baja there was a 12 mile long fissure that opened up all of a
[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:12.920]  sudden it's not deep but it cracked you know for 12 miles now that's very close
[02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:19.560]  to it's just south of the Salton Sea area in Southern California which is a
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:24.600]  very thin part of the plate now I'm hang on we gotta go to we gotta go to
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:27.200]  break stand we want to get that information right after we come back
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:30.480]  from break we'll continue on with that this is the Alex Jones show we're
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:35.440]  talking to Stan Dayo someone who is an expert on earthquake forecasting and you
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:39.360]  can see more information if you go to his site stand dayo.com stay with us

[02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:07.760]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:11.800]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:16.000]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:19.840]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are
[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:24.000]  more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:27.760]  types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the
[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:31.160]  fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:34.840]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to

[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:25.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and I have on the line with
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:31.520]  me standeo standeo.com it's an excellent site with information about
[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:34.880]  earthquakes and of course there's been a lot of information about a lot of
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:40.200]  earthquakes happened just yesterday we had a 6.9 in Peru as well as the 6.1 in
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:44.320]  San Francisco and of course we see there's seismic activity that they're
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:48.840]  warning about in Iceland we're talking about where your risks are and we're
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:54.280]  going to talk to Stan about what you can do the people in San Francisco only got
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:57.640]  a 10-second warning so we want to give you a little bit more of a warning give
[02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:01.800]  you an idea of what to expect in the aftermath of an earthquake how can you
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:06.320]  prepare for it but before we do I want to tell you that this hour of the Alex
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:09.200]  Jones show is brought to you by Occupower it's a new product that we have at
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:14.040]  info wars life it's a new eye super formula nutraceutical it's available in
[02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:18.680]  limited batch supplies only we just got a new batch in the first batch in just a
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:22.480]  few days ago already half of it is gone it's going to take another six to eight
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:27.720]  weeks before we get our next batch this is based on the same regenerative
[02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:32.240]  principles as DNA force but it is at a more affordable price targeting the
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:36.720]  nutrients that you need to replenish the cells in your eye and of course those
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:41.920]  go through and are need to be replaced very rapidly it's the cause of many
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:46.800]  diseases a contributing cause to things like macular degeneration Occupower
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:51.920]  focuses on assisting the natural function of healthy eyes nutritionally not

[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:06.280]  find the other products that support our operation now going back to stand day
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:10.640]  oh stand just before we went to a commercial break you were talking about
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:15.480]  the proliferation of sinkholes not just in America as we were talking about at
[02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:20.640]  the new Madrid fault there's a lot of holes that are forming there in a very
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:24.680]  major fault that's not in California it's kind of in the central part of the
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:28.120]  United States but you're talking about what's happening throughout the world
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:31.120]  especially in Mexico we had to go to commercial break go ahead and continue
[02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:37.320]  with that okay well I've been working for a number of years with a number of
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:41.400]  other people who have also been studying this it's known as the expanding
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:49.360]  earth theory or hypothesis and under this concept a few thousand years ago the
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:56.520]  earth was 25 percent smaller 20 percent smaller it is now and in diameter and it
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:02.760]  expanded and we think that it occurred somewhere around 2300 to 2100 BC that's
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:06.640]  what caused Pangea to break up now this this is in direct contrast to what they
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:10.440]  teach in the in the universities I'll tell you that right now there's a lot of
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:17.480]  controversy over this but it did occur I'm positive with this and if you see my
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:22.040]  hands here what happens the earth expands like this it stretches that's the
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:27.040]  thin mantle where we live on top of it and when that that's stretching it's
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:31.760]  like blowing up a balloon it makes things get bigger in all directions now I a
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:36.880]  lot of the sinkholes I'd say 85 90% of them are due to water intrusion
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:41.280]  underneath structures or underneath the surface of the ground and they make
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:46.800]  round holes rather than jagged long tears of that kind as general rule they
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:51.320]  are round what happens I'm pretty sure is that the expansion of the earth is
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:56.200]  stretching gas pipes water pipes power line stuff underground and they are
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:37:01.880]  starting to leak and the leak of course creates the moisture in there and reduces
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:06.360]  the that the pressure sideways for pressure on the dirt grains there and
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:13.080]  it collapses in in a uniform circular hole now to me this is a sign that we're
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:17.520]  experiencing a planetary expansion a very slight one but we're starting to
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:21.600]  expand as the planet ages now I don't know whether with this will increase
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:27.000]  dramatically or whether it'll just be a small event but it is large enough to
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:31.480]  affect us making these these potholes are the sinkholes all over the planet
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:35.680]  and now starting to make the tears like nearest sonata sonora that works 12
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:43.920]  miles long you know I I could be wrong I put that caveat in there but with
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:46.880]  everything else that I've studied in the past this does seem to be where we're
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:52.960]  headed and people can expect to see a lot more of these sinkholes in in weird
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:56.960]  places but usually over water supplies of some sort and we have for people who
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:38:02.320]  are watching this video feed right now we have a picture of a very long crack is
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:05.600]  that the one guys that he was just talking about yeah that's the one that
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:08.200]  you were just talking about Stan that we have a picture of up there
[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:13.280]  video is the 12 mile stretch I think you said now the other thing that's 20
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:17.040]  kilometers but that's 12 miles I'm pretty sure is what it was anyway okay the
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:20.600]  other thing of course that you had referred to briefly was the fact that
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:25.440]  as we see these plates that they don't have a constant earthquake as we see in
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:30.120]  San Francisco and other places like Wellington New Zealand places that are
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:35.320]  near fault lines they like to see little tiny earthquakes going on all the time
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:39.040]  there's a constant movement between these plates the problem arises of course
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:43.880]  when you don't get that or when you have a lot of tension that is built up so
[02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:47.720]  talk to us about the places that we've got a lot of tension built up of course
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:54.160]  in the New Madrid or New Madrid fault they say that it's been 200 years since
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:57.440]  we've had a major earthquake there and that's the one that runs through the
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:01.680]  central United States and they just had in May the federal government
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:06.320]  simulating the effect of an earthquake that was so massive that it killed a
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:10.560]  hundred thousand Midwesterners instantly and forced another seven million people
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:14.320]  out of their homes I mean how can people prepare for this type of thing and
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:18.680]  and where are the danger areas in the United States maybe take that first then
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:21.920]  we can talk about the preparation all right the danger areas certainly are
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:26.720]  along the New Madrid and as I said earlier in the last segment the there's a
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:32.640]  fault connecting the the New Madrid to the west through Arkansas and up into
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:37.160]  Oklahoma City area and they're doing all this fracking there and I'm not sure
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:44.640]  whether this is fracking for you know gas water etc whatever they're fracking
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:52.440]  for or is it possibly a government effort through private corporations to
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:57.360]  make small earthquakes relieve pressure in Oklahoma City and between there and
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:01.840]  New Madrid I know they did this when I was in Australia down in Perth but there
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:06.360]  was about a 7.8 Richter earthquake building up just north of Perth and
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:09.360]  it would have taken down three quarters of the buildings of the city had it
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:14.880]  released so there were very quietly teams moved in that went through the the
[02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:19.680]  outback there up north of Perth detonating TNT at certain places along
[02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:23.160]  tributary fault lines to make small earthquakes to relieve the pressure so
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:28.640]  the big one didn't occur and it did not maybe a form of geoengineering maybe it
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:32.120]  may well be and so we may be complaining you know when we shouldn't be I
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:36.000]  don't know that's that's probably attributing a lot of kindness to the
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:42.960]  government that may not be there but anyway incompetence okay and other
[02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:49.040]  places the West Coast Northwest Coast you know Oregon Martian State those are
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:53.240]  are going to be areas that could even see tsunamis when that Richter 9 releases
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:59.160]  and it will release it's just we don't know exactly when it's overdue now in
[02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:03.960]  Eureka north of San Francisco in San Francisco itself we're going to see
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:09.480]  more earthquakes there is this the the period of time intensifies New Zealand
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:14.040]  you mentioned that I've been getting emails from people down there one from
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:19.640]  a Maori lady the Maori Indians that lived there and she was telling me that she
[02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:24.040]  had a dream vision of magma and flowing from the Central Island
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:28.360]  Central of North Island down toward her at Wellington again that being Lake
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:34.320]  Taupo and that region is under a huge amount of stress whenever that went off
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:39.280]  back in the 87 AD the last time it made dust go up into the northern hemisphere
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:42.520]  it's so heavy that the Chinese astronomers recorded three days of
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:47.080]  darkness from it not knowing what caused it so that's another area of people in
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.760]  New Zealand are pretty much aware of that we've covered it up been down visited
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:56.520]  Holly and I with the IGNS down there and did enough shame on the radio of
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:41:59.200]  their government that they started funding and money to start monitoring
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:03.160]  temperatures and pressures there to warn people and try to save as much of
[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:09.680]  North Island as they can when it is so there let's see the Middle East of
[02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:14.640]  course well you know Iran Iraq area into the Mediterranean that's going to be
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:21.040]  unstable for for some time so in the United States the Madrid Yellowstone area
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:25.280]  and the Northwest Coast home and down into California down to the bottom all
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:30.880]  those are areas that are likely to suffer some severe earthquake damage as I
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:35.360]  said to you before if you look at the plots of earthquakes I've got on my
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:38.680]  show images page you'll see one that shows the plot of earthquakes for the
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:44.000]  last oh 40 50 60 years in the United States and you'll see kind of a clean
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:51.760]  zone you know up above Texas and that clean zone stops at the east side of
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:55.800]  the Rockies on your map it would be like that here look at me on PBB side of
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:59.520]  the Rockies and those areas are fairly stable but outside that it's anybody's
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:04.440]  game now you can do a lot of things to help you prepare for that on our
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:09.320]  website standio.com at the very top left-hand corner in a yellow box it
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:15.120]  says free prep info and next to that it says nuclear it says NBC but it means
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:18.920]  nuclear biological and chemical preparation and next to that threat
[02:43:18.920 --> 02:43:25.960]  watches and if you click on say the first one prep info that will immediately
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:31.840]  tell you some things that you need to do for food storage water treatment it
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:35.680]  takes you to sites you know that you can just click on that they supply these
[02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:40.360]  various things and also on that page you'll see dare to prepare the cover
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:46.120]  of Holly's book which is I think 632 pages long and it it's kind of the Bible
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:50.880]  of emergency preparation I mean even first responder schools use it to teach
[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:58.680]  their first responders if you have time get that book and read the sections that
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:04.000]  are pertinent to your area you know for earthquake or tsunami or volcano or
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.920]  tornado lightning strike all kinds of things there's about 70 different things
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:17.160]  that she prepares you for what you need for that medicine food water then and
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:20.720]  then of course many of the things that you would do for a natural disaster the
[02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:23.720]  same sorts of things that you would do to prepare for a nuclear biological or
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:28.240]  chemical attack you need to get you know bandages beans and bullets as they say
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:33.520]  you know the times I think medical care store food and water or the ability to
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:39.080]  purify your water and then of course a means of defense if and when society
[02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:44.680]  breaks down NBC attacks are they've got some curly edges to them though I mean
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:48.160]  like if you get the MP polls from it it'll wipe out your electronics your
[02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:52.920]  computers and communication and you'll be without contact to the outside world
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:57.920]  if it's a dirty bomb it pollutes your area then there are things you need to do
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:03.200]  to mitigate that she even you know Holly's looked at this and there's a
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:06.640]  way that you can actually walk out from under the fallout cloud because it goes
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:11.120]  up so high that you have a several hours to walk away from the direction the
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:14.960]  wind is blowing it to get out of the fallout if you're going to weather the
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:19.080]  fallout she's got a section in there to tell you about how to build an in-home
[02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:24.760]  shelter with dirt or with concrete to steel whatever in your home and it's
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:28.000]  not like a major construction thing just you pilot boxes of this stuff get
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.560]  boxes put sand in it and that kind of stuff and build yourself especially in
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:36.720]  a basement a cubby for two weeks maybe three weeks until the radiation dies
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:40.080]  down that's if you're right under the the anvil that the cloud that drops the
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:44.040]  stuff if you you know you're gonna you're gonna know whether it in situ but
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:48.520]  you know they're just practical things but they're different than just normal
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:53.680]  preparation for you know weather events and you've also got to prepare for
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:59.920]  people looting crazy people so that means you know bullets as you said and
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:04.160]  then food and you need a lot of people forget that they need to have water down
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:09.040]  there potable water to eat their freeze-dried foods and things because
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:13.880]  those things are dry and you need the water yeah little things like that and
[02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:18.760]  of course that's all there on those pages and then in printed form it really in
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:24.360]  great detail is that they're prepare book and you know we we have sold tens of
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:29.360]  thousands of those things I just they fly out the shelf so it's not a minor
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:36.360]  work it is a serious work that helps you think your your prep needs through
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:39.760]  whether you need medicine or you got children you to communicate with or
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:44.040]  meeting places weapons all kinds of stuff and they can find that at your
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:49.840]  website which is Stan dayo.com that's d-e-y-o Stan dayo.com and they can
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:54.560]  also see the different maps that you've got there showing where the highest
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:58.400]  risks are for different types of natural disasters not just earthquakes but
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:04.720]  other types of natural disasters as well now I looked on your bio here and I
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:09.480]  thought it was a bit interesting that you worked on a Tesla based energy system
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:12.960]  that says similar to Dr. Henry Morays is that's anything you want to talk about
[02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:18.920]  in terms of survival I mean what do we do in terms of a longer term situation if
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:23.480]  we want to have some power you know it's something that is what what can we do in
[02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:27.600]  terms of an off-the-grid scenario to get ourselves a little bit more
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:31.240]  independent to take care of ourselves because that's one of the most fragile
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:35.320]  things that we have of course is the the grid and the food supply chain that we
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:38.480]  have in this country the more sophisticated the chain of supply the
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:43.200]  more sophisticated the chain of energy delivery the more vulnerable it is
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:47.840]  absolutely we should have decentralized power so that every home produces its
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:53.400]  own ideally but that's not the way the controllers want it certainly you know
[02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:57.880]  they can't make money doing it that way not as much and you can't control the
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:02.400]  people by cutting off the power when you want to at your discretion now to
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:07.200]  prepare for this or to mitigate for it there are a number of free quote-unquote
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:11.880]  free energy systems systems that have been out there Joseph Newman has one I
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:18.240]  I've not been able to reproduce that but it's rather bulky and what I've been
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:22.380]  looking at is what Dr. Morey did and that was to stretch an antenna about 85
[02:48:22.380 --> 02:48:28.920]  feet long insulated and tap it at about the one-fourth length mark with a an
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:33.400]  antenna wire or a connector wire that's insulated coming down into a couple of
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:39.600]  boxes that use Tesla step down coils the trick is that he didn't know where he
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:45.600]  was getting the energy from he actually did it and was able to run it for 159
[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:50.160]  hours in a locked box and a sheriff and a judge and everybody watched it there's
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:53.560]  no hocus pocus about it and they could take him anywhere out there near a
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:58.600]  stream out in the country and he could drive down the 16 foot deep copper
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:03.880]  stake for his ground and the river where it's good conduction hook that to the
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:07.200]  bottom part of these boxes and then the antenna part to the top and he was
[02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:10.760]  drawing 10 kilowatts of power for a hundred and fifty nine hours until they
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:13.600]  decided to shut it off wow that's significant because if you're looking at
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:18.640]  a solar power for your home I mean 10 K is is that's a pretty that would be a
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:23.640]  really large solar system here here's the beauty of his you didn't need
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:27.840]  batteries this sport day and night the only the only difference in the power
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:35.240]  he received at night it dropped down about 25% well the reason that he
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:40.440]  couldn't figure it well he didn't know about the details of the solar wind the
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:43.920]  particles that come from the Sun and hit our upper atmosphere of the charged
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:47.400]  upper atmosphere and they vibrate the upper atmosphere at various frequencies
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:52.440]  but he knew he had to tune his device his antenna to a certain range of
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:56.600]  frequencies and he would kickstart it by you know putting a spark on it and wait
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:01.040]  a minute did it start to auto-resonate no okay do it again you better do it
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:06.360]  several times until the antenna caught and started to self-resonate you know
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:11.480]  to to build up charge on it and once it had a charged envelope around it the
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:15.520]  vibrations on the upper atmosphere in the atmosphere from the solar wind we
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:21.160]  were talking millions of cycles that vibration passed down as squeezes on his
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:25.760]  charged envelope on the antenna which produced voltage which he trapped a
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:30.320]  little arc gap inside his device and then protected it so it couldn't go back
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:33.560]  out so it had a high voltage diode that he made in those stages for the
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:38.440]  primitive but he didn't do it that's fascinating yeah that's fascinating I
[02:50:38.440 --> 02:50:41.720]  want to I want to yeah we've got to go to a commercial break I want to pick back
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:46.440]  up with that right after the break we'll talk to Stan Dayo Stan dayo.com
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:51:01.160]  information you really need to hear say with us another major health threat this
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:05.160]  one in Toledo Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told not to
[02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:09.160]  drink the water Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency did you know
[02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:14.520]  that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:19.120]  single day if there's a water emergency will you be prepared panicked

[02:52:07.080 --> 02:52:11.800]  test of time for 6,000 years gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth
[02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:16.200]  according to the World Gold Council in the US Mint demand is at an all-time high
[02:52:16.200 --> 02:52:20.040]  the stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common
[02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:24.160]  sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day

[02:53:11.440 --> 02:53:17.360]  fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV you asked for it we listened and
[02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:21.920]  we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model the
[02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:26.520]  brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40 inch TV it simulates
[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:31.480]  the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home and when
[02:53:31.480 --> 02:53:35.400]  burglars think someone is home watching television they're likely to pass your
[02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:40.560]  house and move on to an easier target the new brighter fake TV is only 39 95

[02:53:59.160 --> 02:54:17.760]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we've been talking to
[02:54:17.760 --> 02:54:24.120]  Stan Dayo at stando.com that's DEYO and of course we had him on for his
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:27.800]  interest in earthquakes and the information that you can find at his
[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:31.640]  website showing the places where you're most likely to be affected in the
[02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:36.280]  United States by earthquakes also showing information about what you can do to
[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:41.080]  prepare for earthquake disasters or other natural disasters that may be your
[02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:45.960]  area the country might be more prone to or your area of the world and also what
[02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:50.640]  you can do to protect from nuclear biological and chemical disasters if
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:54.440]  you're not prepared you're going to wind up going through what we saw at
[02:54:54.440 --> 02:54:59.680]  Hurricane Katrina you'll get the full FEMA treatment I don't think you want
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:02.560]  that so you want to make some preparations in advance for food for
[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:07.720]  medicine and for bullets bandages beans and bullets as they say now we were
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:10.960]  talking just before the break and I want to continue a little bit with this he's
[02:55:10.960 --> 02:55:17.080]  also very interested in free energy research he's been to Australia in 1971
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:21.240]  to work on these systems and Stan do you have some information that you were
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:23.960]  just talking about this Tesla system do you have some information about that on
[02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:29.160]  your website not on that particularly because I wanted to be sure that it
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:34.200]  worked and work out the details before I put it out publicly and I have also been
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:38.720]  splitting my time with another electricity gatherer which is a static
[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:43.400]  electricity gatherer together electric charge out of the air when the wind blows
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:50.160]  through a a non-moving type Cali in fact if you go to the show images page
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:56.160]  second row from the bottom and be the first image it looks like a half of a
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:56:00.840]  disc or plate is blue and you click on that it'll take you over to a page that
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:05.080]  has a picture of what I this wind electrical generator that I've been
[02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:11.840]  working on and it uses the Lord Kelvin water drop technique to get the
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:15.960]  moisture in the air to pass through a grid and generate high voltage charge
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:19.800]  that you can then run a high voltage generator with which the the Japanese
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:24.960]  have already built and are testing it and I don't have up the the links to
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:28.960]  that to their device yet but I saw it running at several thousand rpm just
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:33.240]  from static charges now this works when there's wind and with this you would
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:36.960]  probably need a battery system and inverters but I'm working on that as
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:41.560]  well because it's perhaps safer for people to use than the the moray device
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:46.200]  which can generate lethal voltages however you know as I get these things
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:50.720]  developed I will certainly share them with folks it's well it's fascinating
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:54.840]  research and there's a lot of stuff that that Tesla did tapping into the electric
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:59.200]  fields around our our earth and really fascinating research much of which
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:03.120]  unfortunately died with him people have bits and pieces of they're trying to
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:09.560]  reproduce it certainly you know we look at solar you look at wind power those
[02:57:09.560 --> 02:57:13.360]  are very effective technologies even though they're they're certainly not
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:16.520]  the free energy that you're talking about they're still effective technologies
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:21.280]  if they're done on a decentralized off-the-grid scenario they don't make
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:24.560]  much sense when you try to put them on the grid because they all require
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:29.240]  storage and when you're trying to create enough power to power the grid that
[02:57:29.240 --> 02:57:34.200]  creates astronomical requirements for storage which they just simply don't have
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:38.120]  the technology for that but they do work well with decentralized off-the-grid
[02:57:38.120 --> 02:57:44.000]  situations don't they they do and one of the problems with solar is that most of
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:49.040]  our panels are made in China and the quality has been really really poor we're
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:54.080]  talking massively poor and after 15 years they're starting to not produce as
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:58.000]  much power at all maybe drop down 50 to 60 percent of what they're supposed to
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:01.600]  so we're gonna have to find a better system at one that's protected from
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:06.400]  the environment so it doesn't fog over the glass that covers the the silicon
[02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:10.320]  cells and things like that but that's interesting yeah with it going to
[02:58:10.320 --> 02:58:14.560]  manufacturing moving to China the price dropped dramatically but now we see that
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:18.400]  drop in quality of course well thank you so much for joining us stand dayo.com
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:23.760]  is a website to give that information join us tonight at 7 p.m. we'll have the
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:28.160]  nightly news at 7 p.m. Central and tomorrow 11 a.m. Alex Jones will be back on
[02:58:28.160 --> 02:58:40.240]  the Alex Jones radio show
