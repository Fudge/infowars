[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]  television but uh i had once or twice actually seen the television show because it's very
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.840]  popular one of the most popular on cable um on fx rescue me the star rescue me and he plays the
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.480]  fireman franco on the program and uh he's had a lot of other roles of course in television and
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.560]  movies and uh but the point is he has the courage to go public on 9-11 you know frankly uh kurt
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:33.520]  vonnegut uh didn't it was never clear if kurt vonnegut wanted his views on 9-11 to be public
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.080]  so i didn't make his full views that have been relayed to me and threw him to me uh on 9-11 as
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.400]  we put a story out yesterday about was kurt vonnegut a 9-11 truther the headline probably
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.120]  should have been kurt vonnegut was a 9-11 skeptic and i found out that he'd seen my films uh by one
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.840]  of his uh business partners his associate then i got in contact with him i sent him more of my
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.120]  films per request and uh kurt vonnegut then sent me a signed uh you know one of his lithograph
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.040]  paintings of the open bird cage you know the freedom of the mind i guess or freedom of the
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.600]  soul is what it symbolizes he said or just you know freedom and uh you know hand signed and i
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.160]  just felt like you know the guy died two days ago it was public yesterday and that's important
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.240]  historically i mean he said the only difference between bush this is an exact quote the only
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.160]  difference between bush and hitler is that hitler was elected and he was elected the president then
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.600]  he became president and chancellor abolished those offices for the office of the furor
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.720]  when von hindenburg died he became the chancellor as well so uh yes uh bottom line kurt vonnegut
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.400]  another you know just an icon uh was investigating 9-11 and i can tell you knew that it was a
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.440]  certainly wasn't what we were told but i'm going to leave it at that because some of that stuff
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.760]  that was relayed to me was private um but um we deserve to know that so i'm going to leave it at
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.040]  that there were a few skeptics on the message board going what are you doing what are you
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.520]  posting this for you know so you claim he sent you this letter and he sent you this this uh
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.840]  you know little pictures a hand sign oh i bet well folks i mean it's really true that uh james
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.760]  brolin's gone public on 9-11 and rosie o'donnell and charlie sheen and and frankly if i told you
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.040]  the people that i know personally that know about 9-11 it even dwarfs those huge celebrities
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.600]  of the top five biggest people in hollywood i personally talked to three of the biggest
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.200]  okay who who who who've known for years it's an inside job but they're not going to go public
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.440]  and i'm not going to blow their cover but i'm going to shut up about that
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:46.000]  uh daniel um sanjata has incredible courage and he joins us now via cell phone are you in chicago
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.120]  or los angeles i'm actually in new york city right now we're in new york right now well thanks for
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.040]  this thanks for listening for three minutes while i babble tell us a little bit about yourself
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.000]  about your tv show you know uh why you like playing a fireman some of the easy stuff up
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.720]  front and then how you woke up to 9-11 and what you think happened and what the repercussions
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.680]  have been of going public sure well uh you know there really haven't been too many uh
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.760]  repercussions at this point alex i think i'm a small enough fish in the pond that my
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.440]  coming out publicly about 9-11 being an inside job has not created any you know tremendous you
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.880]  know seismic uh disturbances uh but um i did want to say though i think it really is getting to a
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.040]  point where uh it's i don't know the quote exactly i've heard you say it many many times though that
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.760]  that you know it and i'm hoping that you can repeat it for my benefit maybe for the benefit
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.480]  of your audience members who might also not remember it's something about uh when a patriot
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.640]  first speaks out it's you know it's something that's dangerous sure sure it's mark twain and
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.960]  i usually flummox it myself but uh i mean the full quote is a patriot in the beginning is a
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.360]  scarce man uh hated and feared and scorned but in time when his cause succeeds the timid join him
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.480]  because then it costs nothing to be a patriot that's my point amen amen to that um i think it
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.520]  really is getting to the point where it's uh i wouldn't say it's getting to the point where it
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.680]  maybe costs nothing to be a patriot but it certainly seems like it's getting to that very
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.360]  critical tipping point where speaking out about 9-11 truth is uh it is something that's becoming
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.560]  almost popular to do and i don't know what exactly it is you know it's almost like i'm watching this
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.560]  huge damn that seems like it should have broken about three four months ago uh and maybe when it's
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.360]  maybe when loose change hits theaters this summer uh maybe if we can finally get a very public
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.280]  platform for people like professor stephen jones uh yourself uh other people who have come out
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.400]  publicly rosy charlie to actually talk about these issues maybe then maybe then it'll the
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.120]  dam will completely break and uh and it'll become it will have an opportunity to really debate the
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.800]  actual facts of uh and points of contention in a public arena that's what i'm really hoping for
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.840]  in terms of my background um you know i'm just again i'm a small fish in the pond i'm just i'm
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.600]  a working actor in new york city the only reason why i felt like me speaking out may possibly uh be
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.120]  important in any way is because i happen to be representing me and the other guys on the show
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.960]  we're representing these heroes these men and women who who died that day and who risked their
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.160]  lives daily doing a job that most of us do not have the courage to do um and my moral conscience
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.160]  just wouldn't let me would not let me remain silent considering uh the uh the grave importance
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.920]  of this particular issue well i wouldn't call you a small fish but i would say this i'm i mean i'm
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.760]  a nobody but we're all somebody at the same time and and it is courage for a school teacher that
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.920]  goes public or a professor or a police officer or a fighter pilot or somebody with one of the you
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.880]  know almost highly rated tv shows on cable uh i mean i mean you're not a small fish it does take
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.360]  courage and you're right that it's getting a little bit safer for people to go public i just
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.280]  wish that some of the really huge names out there and some of them have been kind of demonized and
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.840]  set up as a late kind of a hint so maybe that's why you're not hearing one of them go public
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.760]  um because of the mistakes they've made or whatever but you know the point is
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.600]  uh hint hint later it's not very hard to figure out here folks uh i mean there's just so much
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.560]  going on this is do or die i mean these globalists i mean they may set off a nuke
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.200]  they could start a new war they could release bird flu i mean you can't put anything past them
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.600]  uh give me your response or your angle on what i just said there uh absolutely i mean i really do
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.920]  think that it's crucial uh especially before the 2008 elections i mean i've heard your predictions
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.600]  and i've heard predictions from other pretty credible experts who are very good at kind of
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.320]  analyzing the uh the weather cat the weather patterns so to speak and being able to you
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.760]  predicted you predicted 9 11 um other people are now saying that you know we're militarizing the
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.240]  area right around uh the borders of iran and uh uh all of the same indicators are present that
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:01.360]  were present before 9 11 for some kind of terrible terrible event and i think that unless i agree
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.240]  with you that unless we do unless we call enough attention to 9 11 unless we're able to to bring
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.760]  this out into a public form of debate it's very possible that we could see another false flag event
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.640]  or any excuse that would give uh bush and his administration a reason a reason to declare a
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.240]  national state of emergency uh would then plunge us into uh you know it would just plunge us into
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.040]  a horrible horrible time in human history and i think it's still possible to stop it i want
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.760]  to believe that i'm an optimist um i would like to believe so anyway now talking to christine
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.480]  embersall uh who's also television movies that's one of the number one shows on broadway right now
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.840]  she went public saying it's a total inside job giving the evidence uh on her blog here on the
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.560]  genesis network with john connor and other places and she got heat from her manager and other people
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.880]  that really got support from the crowd and people in the street what response have you
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.840]  gotten from people uh you know a in uh the uh you know whole hollywood slash new york chicago scene
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:06.880]  what response have you gotten from uh just the general public and then when you're talking to
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.720]  people and uh and i mean i would imagine you warn them and make the same points you've just made
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.720]  here of hey we got to get the word out now hey do you know about false flag terror what do your
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.520]  colleagues say when you talk to them well you know it's interesting there are a couple of my colleagues
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.920]  uh people that i actually work with on rescue me who at first were you know they they listened to
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.480]  some of the information they tried to you know their knee-jerk response was to start offering
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.080]  some excuses well couldn't it have been bad and maybe it was this and wouldn't everybody have had
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.840]  to have been in on it what are you telling me the whole government is in on this in this conspiracy
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:47.680]  um but after looking at the information a little bit more carefully uh soberly kind of comparing
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:54.640]  the inconsistencies that are being highlighted by very credible experts uh to the official story and
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.040]  what we have been told uh now there are a number a number of them who are starting to who have
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:05.040]  come to me privately and are voicing uh their very deep concerns um about 9 11 some of these
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.440]  people are firefighters who work with us every day on the show a couple of these people are actors
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.200]  who work with us on the show um but uh in my in my personal life you know some of the stuff that
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.440]  i've been doing aside from going on uh lone lantern and resistance radio and now coming
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.080]  on your show has been just hitting the streets just hitting the streets with leaflets with uh
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.160]  with dvds copies of loose change or 9 11 mysteries or terror storm and just uh you know passing out
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.440]  the information a couple sometimes you know here in new york city it's almost like you a lot of
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.880]  times you feel like you're preaching to the choir uh when you're expressing these kind of views um
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.760]  not necessarily about 9 11 but you know it's a it is a very blue state um but moving past the left
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:52.800]  right paradigm i think that a lot of people are uh are very concerned about 9 11 don't really know
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.720]  haven't taken the time to actually educate themselves i haven't gotten into any verbal
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.040]  arguments on the street with people um i haven't been attacked by anybody as i've been passing out
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.520]  the information actually most of the responses that i get are uh sometimes people just don't
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.160]  take the information say yeah i know already or yeah we're we're you know we're aware of it um
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.640]  you know it kind of varies it varies and then in my my personal personal life like with my friends
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.400]  family stay there stay there daniel uh daniel sanjata is our guest we're honored to have him
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.360]  just an amazing person whether he wants you to know that or not it's true a lot of courage
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.360]  one more uh individual charging the machine gun nest to try to stop these monsters ladies and
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.800]  gentlemen who are absolutely blood thirsty and completely ruthless they must be met
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.040]  with force of information we'll be right back
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.680]  nuclear reactors provide economical energy but would you be prepared during an accident during
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.200]  nuclear disasters great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere which
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.640]  are then readily absorbed into the body medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.760]  complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident radioactive
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.200]  poisoning potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:17.600]  good iodine this shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.040]  potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:29.840]  stomachs in children the elderly the sick and pets order the official potassium iodate for only

[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:04.400]  source of the problem the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.000]  non-x nail gel is absolutely amazing my toenails now look clear and i'm not embarrassed to wear

[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.000]  well the glass has a natural resonance if the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.320]  is big enough the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters using
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.960]  a similar principle royal raymond rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.760]  different resonant frequencies the biosolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology

[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:05.040]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen it is friday the 13th but that's a lucky day for 911 truth
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:13.360]  daniel sanjata is our guest and of course he is the main star the big star on the fx hit program
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:20.480]  rescue me uh continuing uh talking to your friends uh what's the response that you're getting uh i've
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.880]  been getting more candid responses from people you know that i'm not approaching let's say at work
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.040]  or strangers that i'm approaching on the street you know from friends and family uh the response
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:36.160]  has been uh uh less self-centered shall we say uh definitely you know most of them are are
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.400]  completely on board once i actually point out the inconsistencies with the official story or
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.240]  at least the ones that i've been able to memorize so far i mean there's so many so many thousands
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:51.440]  of them um you know i also wanted to say alex that uh i think it is actually perfect for people who
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.760]  happen to have a lot of baggage let's just say or maybe the way that they've lived their lives or
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.280]  might might be preventing them from actually coming out publicly about 911 because they're
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.400]  worried about ad hominem attempts at character assassination i mean uh you know one of the
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.480]  reasons for instance you pointed this out maybe a week or two ago when rosie first came out it's
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.280]  perfect it's absolutely perfect that she came out because they're going to obviously their their their
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:19.680]  mo is instead of addressing the actual uh points that she is trying to uh you know that she's
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.640]  addressing they will attack you on on your past on your spine on the fact that you happen to be
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.200]  maybe a celebrity and therefore why should you even open your mouth without anything of consequence
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.320]  um that is actually a perfect entree for us to redirect and to say well why is it every time we
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.880]  say something about partially evaporated steel columns and the wreckage of building seven or
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.640]  uh uh you know the the the law of falling bodies and how can buildings collapse at free fall speed
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.040]  why every time we bring up some piece of credible science why do you say something about the fact
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:55.920]  that uh you know so-and-so happens to be uh you know uh you know leading an alternative lifestyle
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.720]  or you know as gay or lesbian or why do you attack me because of uh you know the fact that i used to
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.280]  you know do drugs and and run run around town with you know bunches of women as they've done in
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.480]  various cases with other people who've come out in the past so you know it really just makes them
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.520]  look complicit in an obvious cover-up it doesn't lend any credibility to their denial no you're
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.960]  right i mean they can't help it and and it blows up completely in their face but uh first off i'm
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.400]  really honored to find out you're a listener i didn't do any pre-interview never talked to you
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:30.960]  before until you came on daniel and i'm a huge fan i'm a huge fan of yours absolutely well that
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.760]  just humbles me because it always shocks me how many people tune into this show to hear me bumble
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.640]  around in my redneck fashion but uh thank you so much my friend but no i mean you're absolutely
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:48.000]  right that they ignore it when physicists and scientists and underwriting laboratory engineers
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.880]  who underwrote the buildings come out and say it's a fraud and impossible and a hoax because
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.720]  they have to so but still they take the bait on celebrities because they can't ignore it they blow
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.480]  it up they try to chill free speech and then that blows up in their face i mean i i just at certain
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:10.000]  levels this new old order is really incompetent yeah yeah they really are they really are and i
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.680]  think it's that they're operating just on you know a really really old paradigm that's it that's
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.000]  it terms of you know in terms of controlling the public mind these are tactics that used to work
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.560]  but they're not taking into account the telescoping of evolution and the fact that the human species
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.200]  is now beyond the point of their old methods of control and before they i think before they're
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.040]  able to come up with something new to control the public mind uh hopefully we're going to be
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.760]  able to crack this thing wide open and make sure that it never happens again wow you just said that
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:45.200]  i mean in a great way the evolution of technology alone uh doubling every two years or even faster
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.280]  and it's really just gotten away from them i mean they've got a lot of geniuses and high-tech people
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.920]  in their technocracy that i know are giving them new ways to control us but these old elites are
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.920]  still making the decisions i mean literally folks and i'm not knocking old people people are great
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.040]  but it's like 85 year olds and and and i mean prince bernhard was running most of this out of
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.160]  the netherlands out a few years ago at 93 and was still calling a lot of shots at bilderberg
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.480]  henry kissinger every week's been at the white house it turns out for six years literally running
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.520]  things with george schultz i mean kissinger's almost 90 george schultz i think is over 90
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.920]  i mean i'm sorry folks we're going to kick their butt that's the truth i mean alex how are they
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.320]  how are they marginalizing how is it that they're able to prevent the opinions of people like robert
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:34.720]  bowman ray mcgovern kevin ryan david shaylor stephen jones how are they able to keep such
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.480]  credible expert opinions completely marginalized it's something that's hard and i work in the media
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:46.000]  and it's hard for me to fathom how they can ignore what these people are saying i can understand them
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.880]  ignoring me i can understand them ignoring maybe even rosie or charlie or whoever but when you have
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.640]  people who are obviously in the know you have retired air force pilots people who train the top
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:03.280]  guns who are coming out and saying 9 11 was an inside job and cnn bbc none of the major
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.600]  media news outlets are even giving this you know giving it even a moment of attention how is that

[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:08.400]  wow this is a really great interview i enjoyed getting the perspectives and talking to
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:15.680]  daniel samjata who again has the hit tv show one of the stars one of the most popular stars
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:22.400]  up there on the hit tv show that's on fx rescue me where he plays the part of a firefighter
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.520]  and they're in new york i guess producing the tv show they have a chance to talk to a lot of the
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:34.720]  firefighters in new york and i have this experience when i was in new york at several
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.240]  different memorial services over several different anniversaries and i've been there to cover the rnc
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:46.800]  as well and four four years ago or so about half the cops really hated us and a lot of the
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.480]  firefighters said yeah we know something's going on but we don't know if it's an inside job
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.400]  now that's totally flipped where the majority of the firefighters literally were going oh yeah we
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.360]  know and telling us all these facts and statistics and numbers most of the cops knew my name hey alex
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.200]  how you doing keep it up and then they'd turn away and smile at us i mean it was it was amazing
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.200]  that's why i'm going to go back this sixth anniversary on 9-11 we're just going to have a
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.120]  spontaneous demonstrations there on the morning of 9-11 i hope to see you all there and i'm sure
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.120]  there'll be more events as well as as that develops uh daniel what were we talking about
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.200]  before we went to break there was some point and then you got cut off by the break yeah i was just
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.920]  wondering alex i mean with your with your intimate knowledge of the way that the media works and the
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.800]  way that they try to manufacture consent bound debate etc etc how is it possible they're
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.320]  marginalizing the opinions of such credible experts as you know robert bauman ray mcgovern
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.800]  and the list goes on i mean people who actually are in the know and his opinions should be listened
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.920]  to again i i said before we went to the break i can understand them ignoring somebody like me
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.240]  or marginalizing somebody like rosie o'donnell or charlie sheen even though they shouldn't
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:58.240]  but when it comes to the people who come from the institutions that people who worked inside
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.880]  the system who are coming out publicly saying 9-11 was an inside job how can they ignore those
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:09.840]  opinions i just don't understand that well uh operation operation mockingbird number one because
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.640]  going back to the 50s we have the cia documents where they brag about how they already controlled
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.800]  almost all the major newspapers all you've got to do is have the editor of the new york times
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.240]  the editor of the washington post or the sub editors at those key papers you'll have a whole
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:32.160]  nest of them key people inside cnn i mean at fox it's open you've got on the board of directors
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:38.160]  viet din who uh you know wrote the first patriot act and torture memos contributed to torture
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:43.680]  memos i mean at fox it's just open you got tony snow you know the revolving door is the white
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:50.960]  house press secretary former fox contributor he'd co-host the rush limbaugh program so you've got
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.840]  fellow travelers with the elite system on the left and the right who are all controlled by the same
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.440]  you know private corporate structures then you've got cia then you've got thousands of top reporters
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.680]  who've been hired for pr campaigns then congress has ruled this illegal but the president continues
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.080]  and clinton was doing it but it's it's ballooned under bush and i'm sure under the next democratic
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:17.440]  president will get even worse that's just the process of billions in fake news and you've got
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.640]  the extreme examples of tommy franks getting 500 plus thousand a year after he got out of the
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.840]  military uh from the defense department and the cia contract to go around talking about how
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.880]  marshal law's coming but you know that's what we have to have it's too bad i mean that's chilling
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.760]  folks they paid him to go out and say that on all these tv shows and i and at the time i said that
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:43.200]  guy's a spook and i saw him on the cover of cigar aficionado you know wearing cia cuff links i mean
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.480]  it's a big joke to these people and they and they think it's all real funny and then you've got
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.520]  others who were just don't even really consciously think about it hey armstrong williams uh we want
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:28:00.960]  you to take 240 something thousand dollars just to go say as a black conservative uh that you're
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.160]  for a head start uh which is really just a big government program to cps the kids sounds good
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.400]  you know to help the kids but still it's big government wise was doing it well it's it's
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:16.080]  corporate welfare it's control uh but the point is you know that's the lighter end of it i mean
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:23.280]  1.8 billion just in fake news for the prescription drug program uh we i added up just propaganda in
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.240]  the first four years of his administration the contracts we can find almost 25 billion in fake
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:34.560]  news brother that's how they're doing it but when a star comes out they know that they can't contain
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:41.120]  that even in the alternative media or in some of the b tier and c tier tabloids so they go ahead
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:46.320]  and try to use that as kind of a cultural zeitgeist to demonize it because they know there's a
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:52.960]  subconscious envy and general hatred in the public a love hate relationship of anyone who's celebrity
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.880]  uh and so they try to act you know it's kind of like the thing with imus i hate imus don't like
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.560]  imus he certainly should have probably had some repercussions i don't know this much but again
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.600]  everybody kind of likes it because oh he's rich let's get him so i mean it's hard to even describe
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:12.160]  how this whole thing you know is this big cauldron that kind of uh mixes together uh but uh basically
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:17.680]  the it's being steered uh by and then of course the big corporate chiefs a lot of them may have
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.880]  an editor under his cia they're not cia they're members of the cfr where they all just get on the
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.640]  same because they have so many uh intersecting agendas uh in their empires that they have to
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.360]  get together and basically try to steer everything i mean i mean that's kind of a nutshell give me
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.480]  your take you know i to be honest the reason why i asked you alex is because i really am having a
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.320]  hard time understanding and it's hard for me to conceive how uh you know without the inside
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.640]  knowledge that you have as i said at the way that the inner workings of the media uh operation
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:54.000]  mockingbird and the like uh it's just hard for me to conceive of how people whose whose whose
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.120]  uh uh opinions are so informed uh people who actually served and worked in the system if you
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.520]  have these uh people with that kind of a pedigree who are at least raising questions at the very
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.360]  least they're raising questions and in the most extreme cases they're actually pointing fingers
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.920]  um you know this free the american free press needs to be absolutely ashamed of themselves the
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.840]  fact that they can just ignore these things or if they do address them address them in such an
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.680]  obviously biased and twisted way uh really just this is to me this is an eye-opener because i
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.720]  really i was aware of the uh you know the manufacturer of consent borrowing a title from
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.920]  noam chomsky i know you're not a big fan of his and i'm starting to have serious questions about
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:40.000]  him myself now well no i mean i i mean i read two of his books i watched one of his videos
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:47.520]  i read a lot of his papers i mean if somebody tells me 95 truth but then gives me
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:52.880]  false solutions you know the un's going to save us well i'm sure there are good people of the
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.280]  un who mean well at the mid-level and the low level it's like the red cross i'm not against
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:03.840]  the red cross itself they're good people in it the leadership is corrupt and knowingly collected
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:08.560]  blood with aids and hepatitis in it and knowingly sold it for blood products you know and knowingly
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:15.200]  steals a lot of the money for themselves so no chomsky puts out a lot of good info it's just
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.520]  that when it comes to 9-11 i've got a clip of him he said so what even if it's true so what
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.040]  well what is he talking about i saw that that was a jaw-dropper i couldn't believe he said that
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.400]  because i mean i had been i had read a number of his books i had seen uh his uh you know most
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.440]  famous documentary manufacturing consent and some others and once i started doing my own 9-11
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.880]  research my immediately i was like oh i wonder what noam chomsky has to say about this he's
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.880]  probably going to have something scintillating something penetrating to say about it and to
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:48.640]  hear him say that it doesn't matter i mean i was like what does he does he really mean that is he
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:54.240]  who does this guy work for who have whose book well reading well he knows it he knows 9-11 truth
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:00.400]  threatens the entire structure and you see the left a lot of these guys that you know are elitist
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.320]  but they delude themselves they can sleep with themselves at night so they can get rest so they
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:10.000]  don't feel guilty well yeah there is always an elite but we need a loving guided you know kind
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.440]  of uh plato elite uh that understands and then and then they just argue over who's going to run
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:24.160]  the power levers you see well you know i think that's one of the reasons why it's really important
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.440]  that we have people like you doing the work you're doing uh other people that you often mention on
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.400]  your show gary franchi at lone lantern uh mark dice with his resistance radio aaron russo coming
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:40.080]  out and making these very important films i mean it really is important that uh people uh as you've
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.720]  said a number of times stop waiting for orders from headquarters and just join this leaderless
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:50.480]  resistance of spreading the truth i mean 9-11 is a watershed watershed issue for so many reasons
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:56.480]  um not the least of which is the larger issues towards which it points uh and it's a perfect you
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.280]  know they really left themselves overexposed here they really really did with this particular thing
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:06.160]  i think their hubris got the best of them and we now you know it's that proverbial soft spot of the
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:11.760]  on the belly of the dragon we have to take this opportunity to reveal this horrific truth so that
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.480]  we can then go forward and dismantle all these other horrific truths of which this is but the
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.080]  most obvious precursor i totally agree but there's also a converse or the reverse of that or i guess
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:28.240]  the mirror image of that not only is 9-11 to break up on all the other truths but if you go okay did
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.320]  the government let black men die of and then evidence shows gave them syphilis when they
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.800]  didn't have enough test subjects and then allowed them to spread it to literally hundreds of thousands
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:43.120]  with the tuskegee experiment over 45 years in tuskegee alabama and surrounding states did the
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.560]  government radiate tens of thousands of american children in nuclear testing uh did they know agent
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:55.840]  orange would do this and they still used it uh did they in operation gladio engulf of tonkin
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:02.160]  and uh with the us liberty and ajax and iran did our government staged attacks or claim attacks
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.280]  happened that didn't happen you see there's so many so many admissions in history where this
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.120]  has already gone on that's what i do with my film terror storm is we start i don't know if you've
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.040]  seen that film but we start out uh daniel showing over those that haven't seen it showing the
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.280]  admitted examples what did you think of terror storm i thought it was fantastic i mean you know
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:27.280]  and one of the reasons why it's so important is that it gives you uh gives it shows the the
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.320]  precedent setting either events or plans that have been made but were not actually carried out as in
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:38.240]  the case with operation northwood it just speaks to you know the types of minds that we are dealing
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.000]  with the kind of things that they will either do or that i will that they will entertain doing in
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.440]  order to advance an agenda and it does not stop short of murdering civilians it does not stop short
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.040]  of attacking soft targets and you know as you say uh you know firefighters carrying dead children
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.240]  in their arms as in the case with the oklahoma city bombing is something that does get the
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.200]  public really really upset and willing to do almost anything to protect what they perceive to
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:08.400]  be security so you've looked at oklahoma what's your view on that um you know i i i don't want
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.840]  to i actually have not done as even a tenth of the research on the oklahoma city bombing as i have
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:19.360]  done on 9 11 so i i'm afraid i can't really speak with any real you know in with a very informed
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.800]  opinion but you've got questions oh serious questions serious questions i mean starting with
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:30.560]  the following the pattern that i uh the the path that i took with 9 11 i started in the oklahoma
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:37.360]  city bombing uh my research regarding that with um just the physical inconsistencies the physical
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:43.200]  evidence you know how does a a truck filled with fertilizer uh you know create the kind of damage
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.760]  that you saw there in the wreckage of the oklahoma city bombing uh what about uh i don't
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.880]  remember the woman her name but you mentioned that there's a woman who worked in the building
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.920]  who saw these guys dressed up in you know uh i don't know hazmat suits or something with sticks
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.800]  of grape butter yeah jane yeah jane graham you know i mean you know uh again i haven't done a
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.440]  lot of research into that but sounds just as suspicious in many of the very same ways you can
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.800]  see the same fingerprints all over that job uh as we find all over the final evidence well i mean
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.280]  the point i made yesterday is really elementary but it needs to be made again because i mean a
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.800]  lot of us don't consciously think about the different mindset of the military leadership
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.880]  and and that's definitely the type of mind you know the type of mo uh type of individuals we're
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:30.880]  talking about i mean they'll send 10 20 000 troops into a battle uh into a position that's untenable
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:36.800]  or undefended just to suck in the enemy to attack them and i mean and i mean that's just a 101
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:43.040]  no guilt goes into it no thought goes into it no remorse goes into it it's a no-brainer it's
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:49.120]  military tactics it's what you do in in big battle settings and so for that same mindset those same
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:55.360]  individuals is it any stretch to think that they would kill 3 000 americans and and others who were
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:02.480]  there but the majority were americans on 9 11 at the pentagon and in new york city at the towers
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.280]  to get their whole new world order agenda basically cemented and get that foundation
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:14.880]  in place and then you've got the answer right there yeah yeah wow just such a you know it really
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.920]  is even at this point for me it's such a hard pill to swallow but you know no matter how much my uh
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:26.160]  there's a certain part of me that that reacts against this daunting knowledge uh i cannot
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.600]  ignore well that's number one because you're subconscious and the same with me i'm not saying
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.240]  you're afraid but your subconscious senses the danger and you like pull back from the flame
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.600]  uh but the only way to defeat this flame is to grab it and smother and it's going to hurt
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.520]  at first but we're going to be consumed by it if we don't so we've got to just grapple with it and
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:46.320]  then secondarily you wouldn't behave like that that isn't in your code that isn't in your heart
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:52.320]  and soul and so it's just so alien but i mean it's alien to think that ted bundy would convince young
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.080]  women to get in the car with him so he could go tie him down and buy chunks out of him for five
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.240]  hours before he raped him and killed him exactly exactly you know it's really hard to believe that
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.280]  there are people out there in the world like that and you don't want to believe that they have their
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.880]  hands on the reins of power of your country but that is uh that is the horrible reality to which
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.200]  we are waking up but for them it isn't the you know the enjoyment i guess biting the chunks out
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.200]  i mean certainly some of them have that same mindset it's just cold-blooded as you know we
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:22.720]  always sacrifice people there's too many of them anyways you know yeah exactly according to uh
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.760]  according to some people well that's their whole religion i mean when you study prince
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.960]  bernhard and philip and all this scum let's take a quick call here let's talk to george
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.880]  george where you calling us from today i'm from indiana welcome you're on the air with our guest
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:43.120]  go ahead thank you alex uh three things on 9-11 i was wondering or two things on 9-11 and then a
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:49.680]  comment uh did they ever have any more information on the stolen 9-11 steal mob or mafia took or
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:56.160]  something well i mean they they cut it all up put put gps trackers on it wouldn't let the people
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.320]  stop even have lunch when they took it to the ships and most of it was taken to china some to
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.600]  south korea uh but now they found some in warehouses the government kept for some reason
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.320]  and we've been able to get samples from those and then that shows that there are the the explosive
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:15.120]  compounds in there of thermate uh do you want to comment on that daniel uh i don't know much about
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:19.760]  it i i'm uh actually it's new information to me the fact that they've actually found samples that
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.160]  were kept certainly fits the mo of criminals you know they just can't help themselves they have to
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:30.720]  keep some trinket of their you know trophy yeah some kind of trophy uh from the murder but um
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.440]  yeah you know alex have those samples that have been found actually have we been
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.200]  professed example for example has professor stephen jones been given access to those samples
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.680]  has he well let me be clear yeah there were several sites there's over 20 of them in the
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:48.960]  country one and i'll just tell you is in michigan another's in new jersey another's in new york he's
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:54.240]  gotten lots of other samples and some of them we've been able to uh get from inside sources
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:59.520]  and we've seen the video tape that they shot of a couple warehouses in new york that does still have
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:05.360]  some of the steel and i really can't get into how we're getting this and i i mean i mean i've just
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:13.440]  been told this by good sources sure sure sure sure another thing um uh i know doing an autopsy
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:20.000]  now might be difficult to see if uh there was a thermite or thermate left in a body but they could
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:26.960]  resume a dog and do a uh do an autopsy on that dog and see if there's thermite in the
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.680]  lung of that dog that had to breathe it i mean you well i mean court order for that there were femur
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:37.920]  bones blown 100 200 yards plus they found thousands of body parts they just found more
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.880]  last week the week before that i mean bones were being blasted out of bodies these explosions were
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:48.160]  so big again if a building collapses number one it wouldn't fly out hundreds of yards number one
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.960]  i mean number two it wouldn't all be burned to a crisp uh and so all there was was little bitty
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.960]  body parts unless you know a few pieces that got excuse me even talking about this for family
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.960]  members that listen you know blown across the street i mean it's just like oklahoma city you
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.560]  got a truck bomb that supposedly blows into the building but the building blows out and blows
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.600]  chunks of it the opposite direction of the truck bomb's main blast on top of buildings across the
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:16.720]  street i mean it's just it's just it's so sloppy how they do this but again they count on us just
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.040]  buying into all of it thanks for the call rory you're up next and we can keep our guests another

[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.320]  thought i'd throw that out there talk about total pop ladies and gentlemen uh but uh you can uh
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:31.440]  daniel before we take a few final calls how do folks tune into your television show um our show
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.720]  again i you know i just want to say and i know you know this alex i didn't really come on the show
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:41.600]  to necessarily plug rescue me but why not well i mean it's the show when we come back on the air
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.960]  i believe it's tuesday nights at nine or ten and sometimes you know listings change so i would i
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.840]  guess tell your your viewers i guess check their local listings or what have you but um you know
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.760]  i think that it has uh in terms of most of what's on television i think that there's an inherent
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:02.400]  social relevance to rescue me's premise uh and uh i mean i would love to see them address this
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.720]  directly although uh you know as fx is a subsidiary of fox i don't know if that will
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.920]  happen necessarily and you're you're rocko on the show for those that don't know yeah franco
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:18.800]  franco but i was going for me it's okay um yeah i don't watch a lot of tv myself but uh yeah that's
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.920]  that's when our show comes on and um you know i just hope that uh the fact that we're representing
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:28.320]  these guys on television will lend some maybe draw somebody's attention you know if they hear
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.920]  me say something about 9-11 being an inside job i really hope they'll do their own research that
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:37.680]  they'll go to info wars.com that they'll pick up a copy of terror storm or 9-11 mysteries or or any
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:42.080]  of the great documentaries that have been made exposing the inside job that 9-11 obviously was
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:47.360]  and you know well fantastic and i totally agree with you uh one last question i should ask this
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:52.240]  before i mean when did you wake up to 9-11 you know it didn't happen immediately you know my
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:57.680]  best friend joey uh he actually on the day was like that looked like an inside he didn't say
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.800]  look like an inside job but he said these buildings looks like those things were brought
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.800]  down by controlled demolition he said it from the very beginning and i was like no i mean i kind of
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:10.080]  thought that it was just i had known that i knew at that point about america's horrific history in
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.720]  terms of our foreign military and economic policy and i kind of looked at it uh as chickens coming
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:20.160]  home to roost in a certain sense uh even the targets made sense from that perspective but over
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.120]  time you know there i would hear a little bit of this i hear a little bit of that and i started
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.600]  you know the concerns started welling up within me and i don't remember the exact moment but it
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:35.040]  was something about charlie sheen having coming out having uh come out publicly and then you know
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:40.880]  kind of a confluence of circumstances and coincidences i also remember you appearing in
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:45.280]  one of my favorite films by richard linklater waking life didn't even know who you were when
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:50.320]  i saw the film but in hindsight uh when i was putting all these pieces together i was like oh
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.720]  that's the that was alex jones and then i you know listened to the radio that you conducted with
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.960]  charlie and it kind of took off from there for me i started then doing my own research and just had
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:05.040]  my mind blown day well well what you're telling us uh dovetails i mean fits perfectly with with
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.680]  the paradigm i've seen and and it was the time charlie came along it was what 9-11 truth had
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:15.280]  already grown to and people really resonated with his courage because of his baggage and other things
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:20.560]  you know knowing that he hadn't you know a lot to lose doing this and it really did trigger a chain
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.800]  reaction and then it was his idea to have the conference that got put on c-span four times
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:29.920]  built up a big audience by the fourth showing all the other things that happened uh and and
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:36.480]  that's now caused rosie and embersoul and so many others to go public and and me and brolin and
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.920]  yourself and and then now all these pilots and all these cia people and all these other folks
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:47.680]  are there is a mass exodus out of the lie into the truth and again sir i think you're actually early
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:53.280]  on uh in the avalanche that we're going to be seeing it looks like an avalanche now but i assure
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.480]  you uh if things continue it's going to be even bigger so daniel i really want to thank you for
