[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:29.920]  Texas Alex Jones it is Wednesday the 27th day of April 2011 we're gonna be
[00:29.920 --> 00:35.080]  live here for at least the next three hours he predicted it with precision
[00:35.080 --> 00:40.960]  it's now happening Porter Stansbury will be joining us economic researcher and
[00:40.960 --> 00:46.800]  journalist the last 30 minutes to talk about the massive acceleration and the
[00:46.800 --> 00:51.200]  decline of the dollar Lord Christopher Monkton will pop in for 30 minutes in
[00:51.200 --> 00:55.720]  the middle of the next hour to continue to break down the moves towards global
[00:55.720 --> 01:00.800]  government because we ran out of time last week Philip J. Berg the lawyer who
[01:00.800 --> 01:04.800]  if you got to pick one person to be the father of the Berther movement it's
[01:04.800 --> 01:09.200]  Philip J. Berg he's joining us coming up in the next segment man Cal Muller also
[01:09.200 --> 01:14.040]  scheduled to be popping in later in the hour to give us his brief take on things
[01:14.040 --> 01:21.640]  and Webster Griffin Tarpley obviously Donald Trump big Democratic Party donor
[01:21.640 --> 01:31.600]  globalist penny stock man imminent domain lover gun grabber socialist
[01:31.600 --> 01:36.360]  healthcare supporter and being worshipped by Republicans right now just
[01:36.360 --> 01:40.120]  looking for somebody with slick talk to save them just like you look for slick
[01:40.120 --> 01:45.280]  talk with Obama to save you they're all puppets and I have said here on air
[01:45.280 --> 01:50.600]  repeatedly that I think it's another Ross Perot type situation to take votes
[01:50.600 --> 01:55.400]  away from a person like Ron Paul or somebody else if the system doesn't
[01:55.400 --> 02:00.200]  like them and so another third-party candidate like Bloomberg who can sell
[02:00.200 --> 02:05.280]  finance could also do that on the left if they want him to and he's basically a
[02:05.280 --> 02:11.000]  spoiler in there this is a guy gives big money to Chuckie Schumer all of it and
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.720]  the way he was having a press conference about the Berther issue and then boom
[02:16.720 --> 02:24.240]  Obama comes out smiling like the Cheshire cat saying oh hey we're releasing this
[02:24.240 --> 02:29.440]  information now knowing full well there will now be a huge debate about the
[02:29.440 --> 02:34.160]  photo not even a scan it's a photo you can see that with the shadows in the
[02:34.160 --> 02:37.600]  lettering we've got our Photoshop people look at it it's a photo of whatever
[02:37.600 --> 02:42.920]  this is so it'll keep the controversy going it'll only intensify it I've got a
[02:42.920 --> 02:48.360]  lot of questions about it but as I've always said two things are going on here
[02:48.360 --> 02:52.400]  when we don't know which one but we do know they've been covering up his
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.640]  college records his childhood records his Indonesian records we know he did
[02:57.640 --> 03:01.800]  change his name to Barry Sotero we know he did become an Indonesian citizen and
[03:01.800 --> 03:05.760]  their statements to that effect but they they've erased those documents and that
[03:05.760 --> 03:09.000]  would make it where he wasn't eligible so they're busy distracting us with the
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.280]  birth certificate as Wayne Madsen said here in the last 30 minutes the
[03:12.280 --> 03:16.040]  broadcast yesterday investigative journalist he said I believe that he was
[03:16.040 --> 03:20.520]  born in Hawaii but that there is a cover-up going on so two things are
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.320]  happening we know there's a cover-up was there a cover-up because he wasn't
[03:24.320 --> 03:28.960]  born in Hawaii or was there a cover-up because they don't want the other
[03:28.960 --> 03:34.840]  records looked at and and within those two points were they covering it up to
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.720]  create this non-issue distraction later and an example of that to boil it down
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.320]  and make it simple Ken Starr and the tens of millions I spent going after
[03:44.320 --> 03:48.600]  Clinton wasn't for missile secrets wasn't for murders wasn't for corruption
[03:48.600 --> 03:55.840]  and for bribery and whitewater and Arkansas and the rest of it it was for
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.240]  Monica Lewinsky and the lies the special prosecutor of the court case
[04:00.240 --> 04:08.440]  because a sexual case with Paula Jones or with Monica Lewinsky that can be
[04:08.440 --> 04:13.480]  limited just to Bill Clinton but when you've got all these other dirty hands
[04:13.480 --> 04:17.600]  with the Republicans involved in Rumsfeld transferring nuclear reactors in
[04:17.600 --> 04:21.000]  North Korea and Clinton involved you can't have investigations about all
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.080]  that and espionage against this country by the globalist transferring us deeper
[04:25.080 --> 04:29.160]  into the world government getting rid of Glass-Steagall all complicit with both
[04:29.160 --> 04:34.720]  parties leadership but if it's about sex then you can go after Clinton with a
[04:34.720 --> 04:38.320]  big political diversion just on that issue and then make all the other crimes
[04:38.320 --> 04:41.920]  of the rest of government be all about Clinton and put it on Clinton not that
[04:41.920 --> 04:46.160]  Clinton's a good guy but he's a puppet a birdcage liner that they wanted to then
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.480]  put all the blame on to put a new one in George Herbert Walker Bush and then
[04:50.480 --> 04:54.800]  Barack Hussein Obama Barry Sotero so that's what's happening here we'll break
[04:54.800 --> 05:00.800]  it all down jam-packed transmission today we'll be right back stay with us

[08:04.400 --> 08:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.160 --> 08:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.680 --> 08:23.240]  alex jones
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.400]  we are live it is the 27th day of 2011 on this Wednesday edition Bernanke is
[08:38.400 --> 08:43.400]  set in a few hours to give a speech dealing with QE2 QE3 the mainstream
[08:43.400 --> 08:47.640]  media and analyst Bloomberg Fox singing in they're all saying oh yeah seven
[08:47.640 --> 08:52.640]  dollar a gallon gas by next year five dollar gallon of gas later in the year
[08:52.640 --> 08:56.040]  here it's now a foregone conclusion they're now admitting it's because of
[08:56.040 --> 08:59.360]  dollar devaluation they're now admitting the stock market's going up
[08:59.360 --> 09:04.240]  because it takes more dollars to buy those stocks just like gold is going up
[09:04.240 --> 09:09.280]  silver's going up oil's going up they're not actually going up the dollar is
[09:09.280 --> 09:13.240]  going down so you think your stock market's worth more you think your
[09:13.240 --> 09:21.040]  dollar is you still has the same value as as as this situation unfolds we're
[09:21.040 --> 09:25.600]  going to be breaking it down here later in the broadcast we're not going to let
[09:25.600 --> 09:29.840]  this whole birth certificate issue completely take over but obviously it's
[09:29.840 --> 09:36.200]  important now in the last three years Webster Tarpley Phil Berg and a lot of
[09:36.200 --> 09:39.880]  other people who I know are serious investigators have said that well
[09:39.880 --> 09:44.320]  there's a cover-up going on of the birth certificate it was first raised by
[09:44.320 --> 09:49.040]  Clinton Hillary he wouldn't release it then and then it's been raised by many
[09:49.040 --> 09:56.680]  others then they released the certificate receipt which is not the
[09:56.680 --> 10:01.800]  original birth certificate and they tend to basically bait the issue by saying
[10:01.800 --> 10:05.040]  no this is the official birth certificate people said no it's not they
[10:05.040 --> 10:08.600]  said yes it is that went on for two years now about six months ago they said
[10:08.600 --> 10:13.160]  okay it isn't the original release it Obama now they've released another one
[10:13.160 --> 10:17.680]  that we've looked at that is a clear photo not a scan and I've had our
[10:17.680 --> 10:21.640]  Photoshop folks look at it it's got a shadow on it there's white around the
[10:21.640 --> 10:26.200]  letters and numbers it's as if they want people to say this is fake I mean the
[10:26.200 --> 10:30.280]  CIA if they did make a fake they can make fake newscast fake bin Laden videos
[10:30.280 --> 10:35.720]  they could put something out better than this so more and more I think it's a
[10:35.720 --> 10:41.520]  complete scyop and that they held this back regardless of what the truth is
[10:41.520 --> 10:47.160]  to later make it the seminal issue of his credibility not the wars the torture
[10:47.160 --> 10:52.520]  the signing statements the secrecy the executive orders the corruption the
[10:52.520 --> 10:57.920]  banker bailouts the government-run health care the nightmare of tyranny
[10:57.920 --> 11:03.800]  that we're witnessing the QE to the dollar devaluation it's all about the
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.920]  birth certificate it's like with Clinton it was all about Monica Lewinsky not
[11:07.920 --> 11:12.000]  missile secrets to the communist Chinese they love to pick issues like this now
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.080]  he certainly has been covering it up so either he covered it up to later make it
[11:16.080 --> 11:20.720]  a political issue when he released it or he's wanted to hide something and they've
[11:20.720 --> 11:27.280]  now had two and a half years to fake this but it's a very shoddy fake if it is a
[11:27.280 --> 11:31.080]  fake I mean they've got forensic experts looking at it right now and for the
[11:31.080 --> 11:35.320]  next 25 minutes or so we've got man Cal Muller Eric man Cal Muller who's been
[11:35.320 --> 11:39.160]  saying this is a staged event a setup that we've been suckered into for years
[11:39.160 --> 11:44.760]  he's gonna be popping in to get his view on that we've got Phil J Berg it was the
[11:44.760 --> 11:50.760]  former deputy attorney general Pennsylvania big NAACP guy liberal early on
[11:50.760 --> 11:54.880]  just said show the birth certificate they've erased records in Kenya they've
[11:54.880 --> 12:00.200]  they've frozen his college records here Trump's now saying release those the point
[12:00.200 --> 12:03.240]  is did they cover it up to make it a political issue later and try to
[12:03.240 --> 12:08.920]  discredit those of us that looked at it or are these fakes and he joins us
[12:08.920 --> 12:13.480]  Obama crimes.com is the website and we've gotten a clip of Obama with very
[12:13.480 --> 12:18.760]  pleased with himself today out there breaking in taking over the TV networks
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.560]  they claimed it was all impromptu it was clearly scripted Trump's out there
[12:23.560 --> 12:27.320]  giving a press conference at the very time they break in I mean this is wag the
[12:27.320 --> 12:30.880]  dog type stuff we're gonna try to decipher it Philip J Berg joining us from
[12:30.880 --> 12:36.160]  his law offices in Philadelphia Pennsylvania Phil what do you
[12:36.160 --> 12:41.760]  think's going on here well even if it is a legit birth certificate I've raised
[12:41.760 --> 12:45.480]  the issue for over two years that that's not the significant part here
[12:45.480 --> 12:50.040]  significant is the fact that he was adopted in Indonesia and that's right
[12:50.040 --> 12:53.040]  I mean on record you've been like a broken record here on this show and
[12:53.040 --> 12:56.480]  others saying look it's the Indonesia that's the issue they want us to look
[12:56.480 --> 13:00.040]  at the burst Wayne Madsen said that yesterday look at the birth certificate
[13:00.040 --> 13:03.280]  you knew they were hiding something going back three years ago and two years
[13:03.280 --> 13:08.640]  ago you said look it's Indonesia when I first found my first lawsuit August 21st
[13:08.640 --> 13:13.680]  2008 I said Obama prove me wrong show me your long-form for vlog birth certificate
[13:13.680 --> 13:17.920]  he didn't so we started checking into his life and then we found out I mean it's
[13:17.920 --> 13:22.040]  right there in one of his books he mentions my his parents are divorced he
[13:22.040 --> 13:27.160]  says my stepfather Lolo Sotoro returned to Indonesia before my mother and I when
[13:27.160 --> 13:31.880]  I went there immediately went to school well the 1960s Indonesia was at war the
[13:31.880 --> 13:35.280]  only ones who go to school there were those that were considered natural born
[13:35.280 --> 13:39.640]  you also got that status by being adopted or acknowledged by your stepfather
[13:39.640 --> 13:45.040]  now to enforce the stepfather it's in his book also we have a school record on
[13:45.040 --> 13:49.200]  our website obama crimes.com which indicates his name is Barry Sotoro
[13:49.200 --> 13:54.240]  which indicates that his nationality is Indonesia and his religion is Islam
[13:54.240 --> 13:59.520]  which is Muslim now that's significant because if he hasn't legally changed his
[13:59.520 --> 14:04.840]  name after being adopted his real name is Barry Sotoro so this is just as far as
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.200]  I'm concerned a smoke screen I was on a radio interview this morning someone
[14:08.200 --> 14:12.680]  said oh Phil now you're reaching for straws I'm not reaching for straws for
[14:12.680 --> 14:16.880]  two years over two years I've raised the issue of the adoption it's a major
[14:16.880 --> 14:22.160]  issue when he came back at each tent of Hawaii what was his status if he was
[14:22.160 --> 14:26.840]  natural born when he was adopted in Indonesia he was he lost his status
[14:26.840 --> 14:31.840]  because Indonesia did not provide for dual citizenship back in the 1960s for
[14:31.840 --> 14:35.960]  dual citizenship you need both countries to agree and Indonesia did not agree
[14:35.960 --> 14:39.820]  with the United States until 2005 well Phil let me stop you briefly and we're
[14:39.820 --> 14:43.160]  gonna hold you you know for a couple segments and have Tarpley Webster Tarpley
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.760]  pop in with his view to augment and add to the debate we've got man Cal Muller
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.360]  popping in a little bit later syndicated radio host my issue is
[14:52.360 --> 14:57.560]  something something corrupt is going on here the way they wouldn't release it
[14:57.560 --> 15:02.280]  for three years you know going way back into the campaign the way they released
[15:02.280 --> 15:08.800]  this this receipt of it that also had a lot of issues with it and kept saying
[15:08.800 --> 15:12.440]  this is the long form we know they lied about that it was almost like they were
[15:12.440 --> 15:16.880]  baiting the hook the whole time but we know that private corporations
[15:16.880 --> 15:20.680]  intelligence agencies you name it can make really good fakes of anything they
[15:20.680 --> 15:25.040]  want including fake newscast fake video they can shoot video of a few seconds
[15:25.040 --> 15:28.840]  of you and then morph it with computer programs that are almost two decades old
[15:28.840 --> 15:35.000]  my question here is looking at this new long form birth certificate it looking
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.800]  at it in Photoshop blown up I mean it looks like a five-year-old did it it
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.200]  looks fake if they were gonna put a fake out it would be better than this
[15:42.200 --> 15:46.600]  something's going on here well we'll have to take a look at I'm looking for
[15:46.600 --> 15:50.680]  the response from the forensic people the key you have to look at is the
[15:50.680 --> 15:55.000]  doctor's name and doctor's signature I'm sure that matches up but it wouldn't put
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.920]  anything past me because you have to remember for as you stated for the past
[15:58.920 --> 16:02.520]  two and a half years they've been saying that the document they put up was the
[16:02.520 --> 16:06.040]  birth certificate it was not so if they were lying about that they could be
[16:06.040 --> 16:10.120]  lying about this but even I don't care what it is even more significant as the
[16:10.120 --> 16:14.120]  fact he was adopted when he went to Occidental College people remember
[16:14.120 --> 16:18.320]  calling him Barry his legal name is Barry Sotoro if he hasn't legally changed
[16:18.320 --> 16:23.920]  his name his name is Barry Sotoro as far as I'm concerned Obama is a fraud and
[16:23.920 --> 16:27.320]  he's a phony and this the biggest hoax against the United States of America in
[16:27.320 --> 16:32.480]  over 234 years and I'm not gonna stop on this I'm gonna continue now many other
[16:32.480 --> 16:36.320]  attorneys have pursued different actions over the years I believe I'm the only
[16:36.320 --> 16:40.920]  one the only attorney in the country who's brought up the adoption issue and I
[16:40.920 --> 16:44.200]  think it's significant and I think that's why my phone's ringing off the hook
[16:44.200 --> 16:48.080]  today everyone wants an interview I was interviewed overseas already by the
[16:48.080 --> 16:54.520]  Guardian in England and other places Phil to stop you again and and I mean
[16:54.520 --> 16:59.600]  just to inject the wider spectrum here this has gone from a backwater issue
[16:59.600 --> 17:03.600]  that you going back almost three years ago and I want you to give us that
[17:03.600 --> 17:07.760]  timeline brought forward you were the first for my research and have filed
[17:07.760 --> 17:11.840]  lawsuits you've been credible you've been focused you haven't circulated some of
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.640]  the you know fake reports that have been out there purporting to be you know his
[17:16.640 --> 17:22.440]  foreign birth certificates but we know that people like Dr. Corsi you know he's
[17:22.440 --> 17:25.520]  been detained when he goes to Kenya we know a lot of this started when the
[17:25.520 --> 17:29.360]  grandma over there said yes he was born here and they've got a statue over there
[17:29.360 --> 17:34.480]  and then Michelle Obama comes out and says in speeches years ago that we went
[17:34.480 --> 17:38.880]  back to Kenya his home country so there's all of this going on it's
[17:38.880 --> 17:43.640]  reasonable to ask these questions it was unreasonable for him to not release
[17:43.640 --> 17:47.520]  this earlier so something's very suspicious but now it's one of the
[17:47.520 --> 17:51.680]  biggest issues in the country Donald Trump surged in the polls when he
[17:51.680 --> 17:57.360]  covered it USA Today poll yesterday 62% not believing he was born in this
[17:57.360 --> 18:01.480]  country not sure and so when he said in his speech today the vast majority of
[18:01.480 --> 18:06.320]  Americans know that this is baloney this may be desperation this may be a fake
[18:06.320 --> 18:10.280]  document I think they miscalculated I think this is gonna blow up even bigger
[18:10.280 --> 18:15.520]  failed well I think so and it should but also we should as we're looking at
[18:15.520 --> 18:19.200]  that birth certificate we should really concentrate on the adoption issue it's
[18:19.200 --> 18:23.680]  really significant I had an argument with an immigration attorney last year
[18:23.680 --> 18:28.520]  he wouldn't buy the argument about with Obama I said let's ask about the
[18:28.520 --> 18:31.760]  children from Haiti being adopted here in the United States he said oh that's
[18:31.760 --> 18:36.200]  easy they several relationships with the people in Haiti they take on the name
[18:36.200 --> 18:39.520]  of the family here in the United States and they take on the citizenship here
[18:39.520 --> 18:43.480]  in this country well I said then why is that different with Obama he said it's
[18:43.480 --> 18:48.560]  different it's not different Obama is a fraud let's see all the records now when
[18:48.560 --> 18:52.560]  he came through an immigration at age 10 let's see what happened see I really
[18:52.560 --> 18:55.680]  believe that he didn't get a came through and as an Indonesia passport I
[18:55.680 --> 18:59.320]  believe he's not natural born I believe he's not naturalized I think he's an
[18:59.320 --> 19:03.520]  illegal alien and therefore his a term as a US senator from Illinois was fraud
[19:03.520 --> 19:08.440]  and the salary and benefits should be returned to the US Treasury we're gonna
[19:08.440 --> 19:14.920]  come back from breaking and with man Cal Muller get your view on some of the
[19:14.920 --> 19:19.160]  statements that he makes and vice versa and we've also got Webster Griffin
[19:19.160 --> 19:23.280]  Tarpley popping in a little bit with Phil Berg in the segment after that and
[19:23.280 --> 19:28.160]  we'll be holding you to about 45 after or so Phil is that good that's fine that's
[19:28.160 --> 19:31.360]  fine as long as you want all right fantastic also talk about where your
[19:31.360 --> 19:35.560]  court cases are going you know the issue here is Obama has lived all over the
[19:35.560 --> 19:41.920]  world he's got at least two other names that are in school records we've never
[19:41.920 --> 19:48.200]  seen a president with these type of you know clamp downs on records and why
[19:48.200 --> 19:52.280]  wouldn't he release it years ago and now it's a big national issue I mean is the
[19:52.280 --> 19:55.280]  system pushing this because it's a nice diversion from other things that are
[19:55.280 --> 20:00.360]  happening like the dollar in floating gas prices exploding or is there something

[24:15.920 --> 24:16.920]  york
[24:16.920 --> 24:19.080]  he doesn't like obama but uh...
[24:19.080 --> 24:22.960]  been on the show for many years and our going back over two years he said
[24:22.960 --> 24:24.720]  he thinks it's a set up
[24:24.720 --> 24:28.880]  uh... and not by folks that are asking the questions but but but overall obama
[24:28.880 --> 24:30.240]  hasn't released it
[24:30.240 --> 24:33.280]  playing along because he doesn't want you looking at the rest
[24:33.280 --> 24:35.920]  of his record but we've got the original
[24:35.920 --> 24:40.120]  investigator phil j burr who himself's a democrat and was just asking the
[24:40.120 --> 24:41.120]  questions
[24:41.120 --> 24:45.080]  uh... here with us and i can attesting pull the videos and audio up
[24:45.080 --> 24:47.600]  phil burr's been saying for really more than two years
[24:47.600 --> 24:51.320]  indonesia is the issue and they admit his name's berry sataro
[24:51.320 --> 24:54.560]  well you had to be give up your citizenship becoming an indonesian
[24:54.560 --> 24:55.520]  citizen
[24:55.520 --> 24:58.960]  and so we know there's been secrecy is that why
[24:58.960 --> 25:01.360]  uh... that they try to keep everything secret
[25:01.360 --> 25:04.480]  but i gotta say man cal um... imagine
[25:04.480 --> 25:08.280]  there i was live on your show today for an hour and a half and while i'm live
[25:08.280 --> 25:12.440]  with you about nine thirty the president cuts in
[25:12.440 --> 25:17.400]  over donald trump the whole thing clearly stays the networks already i don't
[25:17.400 --> 25:20.240]  know if trumps involved in this but you had the point that
[25:20.240 --> 25:23.600]  uh... trumps a big democratic donor the numbers are out he does favor
[25:23.600 --> 25:24.580]  democrats
[25:24.580 --> 25:26.520]  as he tried to throw things here
[25:26.520 --> 25:29.820]  uh... you're on the air with a phil burr man cal what's your take on this
[25:29.820 --> 25:34.180]  well alex i i got a lot of people i voted for ross burrow and ross burrow
[25:34.180 --> 25:35.480]  was a loser
[25:35.480 --> 25:38.360]  i think that i think what we're seeing here look
[25:38.360 --> 25:43.040]  i never i it's so incredible you and i are are doing a little dance were
[25:43.040 --> 25:44.380]  arguing
[25:44.380 --> 25:48.160]  all of a sudden donald on tv we're listening to it
[25:48.160 --> 25:49.680]  And then Obama comes on and says,
[25:49.680 --> 25:51.680]  I was at the White House watching this
[25:51.680 --> 25:54.240]  and I had to jump on TV, imagine this.
[25:54.240 --> 25:57.640]  Jumping on TV, all the networks broke into Donald Trump,
[25:57.640 --> 26:01.000]  not to say that we had gone to war
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.240]  or that we had been attacked,
[26:02.240 --> 26:05.260]  but he was watching it, he couldn't take it anymore
[26:05.260 --> 26:07.640]  and he came out with his birth certificate.
[26:07.640 --> 26:09.440]  I mean, it's a powerful thing.
[26:09.440 --> 26:11.440]  This birther issue to me has always felt
[26:11.440 --> 26:12.880]  like a setup, as I said.
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.300]  But look, now Obama has given a major boost
[26:17.300 --> 26:20.680]  and major credibility to Donald Trump.
[26:20.680 --> 26:23.360]  I wonder if they're not setting Donald Trump up
[26:23.360 --> 26:24.520]  to be the spoiler.
[26:24.520 --> 26:27.560]  He will siphon off enough Republican votes
[26:27.560 --> 26:32.560]  that stiff Mitt Romney will be a dead duck
[26:32.600 --> 26:36.000]  and he'll split the vote and Obama will, you know,
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.120]  be back in the White House.
[26:37.120 --> 26:41.360]  It does feel like this president wants
[26:41.360 --> 26:43.480]  desperately to have Donald Trump run against him
[26:43.480 --> 26:45.240]  because they think, maybe they're wrong,
[26:45.240 --> 26:48.000]  they think that he's an easy one to beat.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.520]  Well, he's got a lot of skeletons
[26:49.520 --> 26:51.240]  and a lot of skeletons that are already
[26:51.240 --> 26:53.240]  out of the closet, that is Trump.
[26:53.240 --> 26:55.600]  Obama does not want to run on his record.
[26:57.200 --> 26:58.480]  So there's two ways to look at it.
[26:58.480 --> 27:00.080]  They kept this secret for so long,
[27:00.080 --> 27:03.080]  it acted very suspicious because something was there.
[27:03.080 --> 27:05.240]  I mean, what about him going back two years ago,
[27:05.240 --> 27:08.920]  saying that the receipt of the birth certificate,
[27:08.920 --> 27:11.520]  and we'll put that on screen, was the birth certificate
[27:11.520 --> 27:13.760]  and they'd say you were a conspiracy theorist
[27:13.760 --> 27:16.080]  if you pointed out that no, that's not the long form.
[27:16.080 --> 27:18.280]  And again, we'll put that on screen
[27:18.280 --> 27:20.200]  and then now they do release the long form.
[27:20.200 --> 27:22.760]  I mean, ma'am, Cal, how long did they do that?
[27:23.800 --> 27:25.400]  Well, what did you just say a couple of years?
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.880]  I mean, Phil Berg, look, I've been following Phil here
[27:29.880 --> 27:32.520]  and it's not my show, Alex, but I mean,
[27:32.520 --> 27:34.160]  I always, here's what I wondered.
[27:34.160 --> 27:37.200]  I always wondered if it would, if the real birth certificate
[27:37.200 --> 27:40.520]  would list him as a Muslim, that's what I thought.
[27:40.520 --> 27:45.240]  I don't know, Phil, I mean, does this end this issue for Phil?
[27:47.360 --> 27:48.560]  Phil.
[27:48.560 --> 27:51.440]  Yeah, this is not nice talking to you.
[27:51.440 --> 27:52.280]  This is Phil Berg.
[27:52.280 --> 27:53.600]  Now, it doesn't end the issue.
[27:53.600 --> 27:55.880]  I think many other attorneys in the country
[27:55.880 --> 27:57.880]  dealt with just the birth certificate issue.
[27:57.880 --> 28:00.280]  From over two years ago, I brought up the issue
[28:00.280 --> 28:03.080]  of the adoption into the Egypt.
[28:03.080 --> 28:05.400]  And when he's adopted, he loses his status
[28:05.400 --> 28:06.440]  of whatever he had.
[28:06.440 --> 28:08.480]  So if he was natural born,
[28:08.480 --> 28:10.680]  once you're adopted in another country,
[28:10.680 --> 28:13.080]  Indonesia did not provide for dual citizenship
[28:13.080 --> 28:15.560]  back in the 1960s, he lost his status.
[28:15.560 --> 28:19.400]  The greatest status he could have now is naturalized.
[28:19.400 --> 28:21.240]  I don't even think he's naturalized.
[28:21.240 --> 28:23.840]  I think he's, believe it or not, an illegal alien.
[28:23.840 --> 28:25.480]  And therefore his term as the United States
[28:25.480 --> 28:27.360]  center from Illinois was fraud.
[28:27.360 --> 28:30.120]  And hopefully people will zero in on that issue.
[28:30.120 --> 28:30.960]  Wow.
[28:30.960 --> 28:32.760]  And obviously if he can't be a US senator,
[28:32.760 --> 28:33.600]  he can't be a president.
[28:33.600 --> 28:35.800]  But Phil, what about the issue of them for two years
[28:35.800 --> 28:39.000]  plus saying that the certificate of live birth,
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.080]  all they released was this computer printout
[28:42.080 --> 28:44.320]  and told us we were conspiracy theorist.
[28:44.320 --> 28:47.000]  In fact, we'll show folks a document cam shot.
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.720]  They kept saying that this was the original
[28:48.720 --> 28:50.160]  and we were conspiracy theorist.
[28:50.160 --> 28:53.200]  Now today they released this.
[28:53.200 --> 28:55.200]  What's your take on that?
[28:55.200 --> 28:57.680]  Well, I think it just shows there are a bunch of liars there.
[28:57.680 --> 28:59.640]  Also significant as far as I'm concerned
[28:59.640 --> 29:02.040]  on both documents is his race.
[29:02.040 --> 29:04.400]  His race is listed as African.
[29:04.400 --> 29:07.280]  African was not a race in 1961.
[29:07.280 --> 29:10.320]  He were either Black or Negro back in 1961.
[29:10.320 --> 29:11.680]  You weren't African.
[29:11.680 --> 29:13.880]  I mean, that's why people have to look carefully
[29:13.880 --> 29:15.600]  at what these documents say.
[29:15.600 --> 29:18.360]  But they've got experts that know how to fake a document.
[29:18.360 --> 29:20.680]  They can create fake newscast if they want.
[29:20.680 --> 29:21.520]  That's what I'm saying.
[29:21.520 --> 29:24.280]  Why does this thing, so you're saying you question
[29:24.280 --> 29:26.760]  the providence of this birth certificate?
[29:26.760 --> 29:27.600]  Absolutely.
[29:27.600 --> 29:30.640]  And why didn't they release it two and a half years ago?
[29:30.640 --> 29:33.560]  I wanna get Eric Mankow, Mueller of Mankow.com's
[29:33.560 --> 29:35.640]  take on that, Phil Burgs take on that.
[29:35.640 --> 29:39.360]  On the other side, of course, Obamacrimes.com.
[29:39.360 --> 29:40.560]  We're gonna be breaking it all down.
[29:40.560 --> 29:41.800]  Mankow, stay there.
[29:41.800 --> 29:43.080]  Phil Burgs, stay there.
[29:43.080 --> 29:45.720]  I wanna get a little bit more from you, Mankow.
[29:45.720 --> 29:47.680]  Then we'll bring Webster Griffin Tarpley,
[29:47.680 --> 29:51.160]  another researcher into Obama's providence with Phil Burgs.
[29:51.160 --> 29:54.680]  On the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:54.680 --> 29:57.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.400 --> 30:02.960]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting
[30:02.960 --> 30:06.240]  that in 2011, we will witness the most important day
[30:06.240 --> 30:08.520]  in America in more than 50 years.
[30:08.520 --> 30:11.120]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[30:11.120 --> 30:13.840]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[30:13.840 --> 30:15.440]  and even how you take care of your health
[30:15.440 --> 30:16.440]  and your own family.
[30:16.440 --> 30:18.680]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions
[30:18.680 --> 30:19.520]  over the years.
[30:19.520 --> 30:21.800]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[30:21.800 --> 30:24.200]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[30:24.200 --> 30:26.760]  Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner,
[30:26.760 --> 30:28.000]  General Growth Properties.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.440]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[30:31.440 --> 30:34.080]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online
[30:34.080 --> 30:35.640]  for free, detailing his biggest
[30:35.640 --> 30:37.200]  and most important prediction yet,
[30:37.200 --> 30:38.760]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[30:38.760 --> 30:40.160]  I can't stress this enough.
[30:40.160 --> 30:42.840]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[30:42.840 --> 30:44.480]  He explains everything you need to know,
[30:44.480 --> 30:47.080]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[30:47.080 --> 30:51.720]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[30:51.720 --> 30:54.280]  That's End of America, the number three.com.

[31:02.000 --> 31:03.480]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones,
[31:03.480 --> 31:05.920]  and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[31:05.920 --> 31:09.080]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[31:09.080 --> 31:12.120]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[31:12.120 --> 31:14.800]  by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[31:14.800 --> 31:17.040]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense
[31:17.040 --> 31:19.480]  for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[31:19.480 --> 31:22.840]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[31:22.840 --> 31:25.800]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[31:25.800 --> 31:28.880]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[31:28.880 --> 31:30.880]  instantly into the bloodstream.
[31:30.880 --> 31:33.240]  With continued legislation threatening the sale
[31:33.240 --> 31:34.960]  of nano-silver products,
[31:34.960 --> 31:38.520]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[31:38.520 --> 31:40.360]  with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[31:40.360 --> 31:43.720]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided,
[31:43.720 --> 31:45.800]  making production fast and simple.
[31:45.800 --> 31:49.800]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today
[31:49.800 --> 31:51.800]  and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[31:51.800 --> 31:53.320]  of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[31:53.320 --> 31:56.320]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[32:01.160 --> 32:03.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[32:03.520 --> 32:05.280]  in the last century alone.
[32:05.280 --> 32:08.480]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[32:08.480 --> 32:10.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[32:10.800 --> 32:13.720]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[32:13.720 --> 32:15.720]  I have turned tremendous influence
[32:15.720 --> 32:17.800]  on our president in Congress,
[32:17.800 --> 32:19.640]  and they really are calling the shots.
[32:19.640 --> 32:22.520]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[32:22.520 --> 32:24.880]  as American citizens to pay attention.
[32:24.880 --> 32:28.160]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[32:28.160 --> 32:30.360]  the criminal offshore cartel
[32:30.360 --> 32:32.560]  held bent on destroying sovereignty
[32:32.560 --> 32:35.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[32:37.360 --> 32:38.920]  They're asking for more matches.
[32:38.920 --> 32:41.360]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[32:41.360 --> 32:43.520]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[32:43.520 --> 32:45.760]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[32:45.760 --> 32:48.640]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[32:55.400 --> 32:58.840]  in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[33:01.040 --> 33:07.040]  ["Big Brother Theme Song"]
[33:07.040 --> 33:14.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:14.520 --> 33:16.440]  You want answers?
[33:16.440 --> 33:18.360]  Well, so does he.
[33:18.360 --> 33:23.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[33:23.040 --> 33:25.040]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:25.040 --> 33:28.480]  ["Big Brother Theme Song"]
[33:28.480 --> 33:30.360]  Discussions.
[33:30.360 --> 33:31.880]  I was just back there listening to Chuck.
[33:31.880 --> 33:33.600]  He was saying, it's amazing that he's not
[33:33.600 --> 33:35.720]  going to be talking about national security.
[33:35.720 --> 33:37.360]  I would not have the networks breaking in
[33:37.360 --> 33:39.360]  if I was talking about that, Chuck, and you know it.
[33:39.360 --> 33:40.360]  Right.
[33:40.360 --> 33:41.360]  Right.
[33:41.360 --> 33:42.360]  Right.
[33:42.360 --> 33:44.360]  Right.
[33:44.360 --> 33:49.600]  As many of you have been briefed,
[33:49.600 --> 33:53.120]  we provided additional information today
[33:53.120 --> 33:56.880]  about the site of my birth.
[33:56.880 --> 34:01.960]  Now, this issue has been going on for two, two-and-a-half years
[34:01.960 --> 34:02.460]  now.
[34:02.460 --> 34:04.920]  I think it started during the campaign.
[34:04.920 --> 34:08.440]  And I have to say that over the last two-and-a-half years,
[34:08.440 --> 34:14.200]  I have watched with amusement.
[34:14.200 --> 34:17.800]  I've been puzzled at the degree to which this thing just
[34:17.800 --> 34:20.440]  kept on going.
[34:20.440 --> 34:24.280]  We've had every official in Hawaii,
[34:24.280 --> 34:29.440]  Democrat and Republican, every news outlet
[34:29.440 --> 34:33.560]  that has investigated this, confirm that, yes, in fact,
[34:33.560 --> 34:38.400]  I was born in Hawaii August 4, 1961 in Kipiwani Hospital.
[34:38.400 --> 34:41.880]  So there you have it, the whole video is up on infowars.com,
[34:41.880 --> 34:43.680]  prismplanet.com, everywhere else.
[34:43.680 --> 34:46.320]  All I know is for two-plus years,
[34:46.320 --> 34:48.400]  all they gave us was this receipt of it.
[34:48.400 --> 34:50.800]  And they claimed this was a birth certificate
[34:50.800 --> 34:52.240]  and that we were conspiracy theorists.
[34:52.240 --> 34:53.840]  Now they released this.
[34:53.840 --> 34:56.880]  And one of the original researchers into this, Phil J. Berg,
[34:56.880 --> 34:57.680]  joins us.
[34:57.680 --> 35:01.000]  Syndicated radio host Eric Mankow Muller
[35:01.000 --> 35:01.840]  also joins us.
[35:01.840 --> 35:04.760]  Webster Tarpley coming up in about 10 minutes.
[35:04.760 --> 35:09.120]  And Mr. Berg is getting more intel in from his forensic team
[35:09.120 --> 35:11.840]  that's looking at this right before the break, Mr. Berg.
[35:11.840 --> 35:14.040]  I don't wanna get Mankow's take on this in a moment.
[35:14.040 --> 35:18.160]  You came out and said that the preliminary points
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.160]  are coming out and that you're now questioning
[35:20.160 --> 35:21.880]  the providence of this birth certificate.
[35:21.880 --> 35:24.120]  You're saying this could be a phony?
[35:24.120 --> 35:27.440]  Well, it could be, but even if it, let's say,
[35:27.440 --> 35:29.920]  let's assume for a minute, it's not a phony.
[35:29.920 --> 35:33.760]  The issue then is he's adopted in Indonesia
[35:33.760 --> 35:35.560]  and that changes his status.
[35:35.560 --> 35:37.880]  He would no longer be natural born,
[35:37.880 --> 35:40.040]  he would be naturalized and naturalized,
[35:40.040 --> 35:42.080]  he cannot be president of the United States.
[35:42.080 --> 35:43.600]  You know, when you heard Obama,
[35:43.600 --> 35:45.280]  he made like a big joke about this.
[35:45.280 --> 35:47.600]  I've been watching this for two and a half years.
[35:47.600 --> 35:49.320]  Yeah, but you also spent like $2 million
[35:49.320 --> 35:50.800]  fighting all our lawsuits.
[35:50.800 --> 35:52.600]  Why didn't you release this information?
[35:52.600 --> 35:55.120]  Why didn't you grant discovery in any of these cases?
[35:55.120 --> 35:56.520]  Because if you granted discovery,
[35:56.520 --> 35:58.440]  we could have gotten this birth certificate,
[35:58.440 --> 36:01.080]  but also we could have gotten your adoption records
[36:01.080 --> 36:02.400]  and all your other records.
[36:02.400 --> 36:04.040]  When he went to school in California,
[36:04.040 --> 36:06.240]  Occidental people called him Barry.
[36:06.240 --> 36:08.960]  His legal name, I believe, is Barry Soutoro.
[36:08.960 --> 36:10.760]  If he hasn't legally changed it,
[36:10.760 --> 36:13.360]  every time he uses Barack Hussein Obama, that's fraud.
[36:13.360 --> 36:14.440]  All right, stop right there, Phil,
[36:14.440 --> 36:15.480]  because I want to go back to ManCal
[36:15.480 --> 36:16.880]  and get his take and then I'll continue
[36:16.880 --> 36:18.440]  with you after ManCal goes.
[36:18.440 --> 36:20.360]  But that's a good point that Phil has.
[36:20.360 --> 36:24.000]  Why did they spend $2 million fighting Phil Berg's lawsuits
[36:24.000 --> 36:25.920]  and millions fighting other lawsuits?
[36:25.920 --> 36:28.240]  Why didn't he just release this ManCal?
[36:28.240 --> 36:31.040]  Well, and why didn't they just give it to Hillary?
[36:31.040 --> 36:33.480]  I think this is a false flag kind of situation.
[36:33.480 --> 36:35.320]  I don't know if it's a forgery.
[36:35.320 --> 36:38.480]  And look, Alex, you're not going to be able
[36:38.480 --> 36:42.040]  to understand what I'm talking about sitting in Austin, Texas.
[36:42.040 --> 36:44.360]  You and Kinky Friedner, they only had a couple of singers,
[36:44.360 --> 36:46.080]  the only people that I know in Austin.
[36:46.080 --> 36:48.280]  Let me say this, I live in the inner city.
[36:48.280 --> 36:52.320]  When I was a baby, my mother had to clutch me at her chest
[36:52.320 --> 36:53.880]  and my brothers, they had to hide
[36:53.880 --> 36:55.840]  because of the groups that were going,
[36:55.840 --> 36:58.680]  we lived in Memphis when MLK was shot,
[36:58.680 --> 37:00.800]  when Martin Luther King, Jr. was shot.
[37:00.800 --> 37:03.640]  I was in the riots and you can see me
[37:03.640 --> 37:07.600]  all over the CNN footage when Rodney King was beaten
[37:07.600 --> 37:09.280]  and it was terrifying.
[37:09.280 --> 37:10.760]  Now you're going to come out and tell America
[37:10.760 --> 37:12.960]  that their first black president isn't eligible
[37:12.960 --> 37:15.040]  and I live in the inner city with two children.
[37:15.040 --> 37:17.520]  My God, our cities will burn.
[37:17.520 --> 37:20.520]  I think they're all too afraid to admit what this guy is.
[37:20.520 --> 37:23.560]  And I also want to say, I found it sickening.
[37:23.560 --> 37:25.200]  Did you listen to all the media people,
[37:25.200 --> 37:27.000]  all the reporters, so-called reporters
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.520]  as he says, news outlets?
[37:29.520 --> 37:30.800]  And let me finish on this, Alex,
[37:30.800 --> 37:32.840]  before you cut me off.
[37:32.840 --> 37:34.600]  I love the presidents in their laughing
[37:34.600 --> 37:35.640]  with all these reporters.
[37:35.640 --> 37:38.480]  Did you hear them chuckling? You just played it.
[37:38.480 --> 37:42.080]  And it's like a throttle Chuck Todd, a Chucky Todd
[37:42.080 --> 37:42.920]  and the rest of them.
[37:42.920 --> 37:44.880]  Let's think about this.
[37:44.880 --> 37:47.120]  They pushed through, we can't have light bulbs.
[37:47.120 --> 37:50.000]  We have to have these new toxic curlicue light bulbs
[37:50.000 --> 37:51.800]  made by GE.
[37:51.800 --> 37:55.360]  GE makes $14 billion and gives a lot of money
[37:55.360 --> 38:00.360]  to the dummy craps and Obama and they own NBC.
[38:01.880 --> 38:03.560]  We have no news.
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.360]  They paid no taxes on $14 billion, General Electric.
[38:08.360 --> 38:11.000]  We all have to get their new curlicue light bulbs
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  and then Chuck Todd and Brian Williams
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.800]  and all of them sit there and chuckle.
[38:14.800 --> 38:17.040]  We don't get the real news.
[38:17.040 --> 38:19.120]  It's so confusing.
[38:19.120 --> 38:20.640]  Well, MenCal, in your gut.
[38:20.640 --> 38:24.280]  In Libya, I mean, what's happening?
[38:24.280 --> 38:26.800]  There is a dark undercurrent going on.
[38:26.800 --> 38:29.880]  There is something sinister happening.
[38:29.880 --> 38:32.440]  And what is it about this guy?
[38:32.440 --> 38:35.320]  And look, Donald Trump, they're setting him up
[38:35.320 --> 38:36.800]  to be a candidate.
[38:36.800 --> 38:38.800]  I think Obama, so that makes me nervous.
[38:38.800 --> 38:41.400]  I think Obama wants to run against Trump.
[38:41.400 --> 38:45.120]  But, you know, Trump has brought up some interesting things.
[38:45.120 --> 38:47.240]  Alex, I guarantee people would know you
[38:47.240 --> 38:50.520]  from Austin, Austin, Texas Elementary.
[38:50.520 --> 38:51.360]  They'd know me.
[38:51.360 --> 38:54.480]  Why doesn't anybody remember this guy as a kid?
[38:54.480 --> 38:55.600]  But what is his history?
[38:55.600 --> 38:57.560]  Well, MenCal, let me shift gears back.
[38:57.560 --> 38:58.640]  Man, we elected.
[38:58.640 --> 38:59.600]  Let me shift gears back
[38:59.600 --> 39:01.880]  because I interrupted you trying to get in there.
[39:01.880 --> 39:03.480]  You are now starting to look at the fact
[39:03.480 --> 39:07.320]  that Sky Television headline, Al-Qaeda operative
[39:07.320 --> 39:10.160]  that killed troops, worked for British intelligence.
[39:10.160 --> 39:14.000]  They now admit that the head of the 7.7 bombings
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.840]  in London was British intelligence.
[39:15.840 --> 39:19.640]  And we're all a-locky hiding out at the Pentagon Fox News.
[39:19.640 --> 39:22.600]  And now Al-Qaeda being the core of the Libyan rebels.
[39:22.600 --> 39:25.280]  I'm glad that you're starting to turn the corner on that.
[39:25.280 --> 39:27.360]  Alex, here's what I know.
[39:27.360 --> 39:29.080]  And it's the foundation of everything.
[39:29.080 --> 39:32.680]  And you know it, and you've used it to great success.
[39:32.680 --> 39:34.040]  And let's tell the people,
[39:34.040 --> 39:36.400]  this is all they need to know when they watch the news
[39:36.400 --> 39:38.400]  or go to school or talk to their wife
[39:38.400 --> 39:41.440]  or talk to their boss or talk to whoever.
[39:41.440 --> 39:44.840]  It's a four letter F word and it's fear.
[39:45.920 --> 39:48.440]  And people in power have always used it.
[39:48.440 --> 39:50.720]  If you don't do it, we say you're gonna go to hell.
[39:50.720 --> 39:52.160]  If you don't do what I say,
[39:52.160 --> 39:53.200]  I'm gonna take your apartment
[39:53.200 --> 39:55.120]  and raise your kids with another man.
[39:55.120 --> 39:58.800]  If you don't do what I say, we're gonna audit you.
[39:58.800 --> 40:00.760]  And this government uses fear.
[40:00.760 --> 40:01.800]  They use a boogeyman.
[40:01.800 --> 40:04.560]  Right now they're using the boogeyman of Al-Qaeda.
[40:04.560 --> 40:06.400]  And do I think they're a radical Muslims?
[40:06.400 --> 40:07.920]  Of course, yeah.
[40:07.920 --> 40:09.320]  I visited the Middle East.
[40:09.320 --> 40:12.800]  Boy, are they primitive kooks.
[40:12.800 --> 40:15.400]  But they keep stoking the fires.
[40:15.400 --> 40:16.840]  They keep creating this fear.
[40:16.840 --> 40:20.440]  My God, we may be going into our fourth war,
[40:20.440 --> 40:23.280]  our fourth war in Syria.
[40:23.280 --> 40:25.880]  And we've lost thousands of our young men and women
[40:25.880 --> 40:27.840]  and we haven't gotten a drop of oil.
[40:27.840 --> 40:30.200]  It's insanity, it's madness.
[40:30.200 --> 40:32.400]  Now we're giving body armor and training
[40:32.400 --> 40:34.520]  to Al-Qaeda in Libya.
[40:34.520 --> 40:36.840]  Al-Qaeda, the same people that bombed us on 9-11.
[40:36.840 --> 40:41.240]  We let 500 hardcore terrorists go.
[40:41.240 --> 40:43.160]  Don't tell me America didn't know about that.
[40:43.160 --> 40:45.440]  We let 500 of them go.
[40:45.440 --> 40:49.320]  We've let how many of them go from Guantanamo on purpose?
[40:49.320 --> 40:52.200]  Yeah, I think we have to create an enemy.
[40:52.200 --> 40:55.640]  We have to have fear because when people are afraid,
[40:55.640 --> 40:57.280]  they give up their rights.
[40:57.280 --> 40:58.800]  They give up their freedoms.
[40:58.800 --> 41:00.360]  Look at the way we're allowing our children
[41:00.360 --> 41:03.360]  to be molested at the airports by these TSA dogs.
[41:03.360 --> 41:06.120]  We're allowing our bodies to be filled with radiation
[41:06.120 --> 41:07.560]  because we're afraid.
[41:07.560 --> 41:08.400]  We're afraid.
[41:08.400 --> 41:10.480]  Not me, I don't have fear.
[41:10.480 --> 41:12.240]  You can rewire your brain, folks.
[41:12.240 --> 41:13.800]  Don't buy into their fear.
[41:13.800 --> 41:15.480]  Don't buy into their propaganda.
[41:15.480 --> 41:17.400]  Sure, but going back, man, Cal,
[41:17.400 --> 41:19.840]  I like your little backhanded comic
[41:19.840 --> 41:21.320]  because I was ranting at you today
[41:21.320 --> 41:24.240]  and that's cute that I've used fear to great effect.
[41:24.240 --> 41:27.720]  I have, brother, you didn't hear what I said.
[41:27.720 --> 41:30.200]  I'm saying that you're telling people about the fear.
[41:30.200 --> 41:32.520]  I'm not talking about you.
[41:32.520 --> 41:34.440]  No, but going back, I want to say something.
[41:34.440 --> 41:37.440]  I do use fear because when I'm afraid of something,
[41:37.440 --> 41:39.520]  when I'm concerned about taxes going up
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.360]  or open borders or stage terror, I come and tell people.
[41:43.360 --> 41:45.960]  So I'm saying when you're at the edge of a cliff
[41:45.960 --> 41:47.240]  and you're hanging out over it,
[41:47.240 --> 41:49.640]  fear is a good thing when it's proper.
[41:49.640 --> 41:54.200]  I'm saying they orchestrate fear to manipulate people.
[41:54.200 --> 41:55.920]  And we need to understand that most of the things
[41:55.920 --> 41:58.520]  they try to make us scared of, like terrorism,
[41:58.520 --> 42:00.360]  aren't really that dangerous per capita
[42:00.360 --> 42:03.520]  because you have people dying from a honey bee sting
[42:03.520 --> 42:06.640]  every year than you do from terrorism.
[42:06.640 --> 42:09.840]  But in closing, man, Cal, give us your website
[42:09.840 --> 42:13.120]  and also any final questions for Phil Berg.
[42:13.120 --> 42:17.600]  Alex, listen, look, they use fear to manipulate us.
[42:17.600 --> 42:20.320]  If they wanted to beat these radical Muslims,
[42:20.320 --> 42:21.160]  guess what we would do?
[42:21.160 --> 42:22.360]  We would send our soldiers over there
[42:22.360 --> 42:25.800]  and we would kill them, you know, end of story.
[42:25.800 --> 42:27.600]  We're not allowing our soldiers to kill them.
[42:27.600 --> 42:29.600]  When we catch them, we're letting them go.
[42:29.600 --> 42:30.520]  They want this fear.
[42:30.520 --> 42:33.240]  And when America is afraid, we give up our freedoms
[42:33.240 --> 42:34.920]  and we allow this kind of tyranny.
[42:34.920 --> 42:37.080]  And my only question for Phil Berg is,
[42:37.080 --> 42:40.920]  is he secretly working for Hillary Clinton?
[42:40.920 --> 42:43.000]  My website is mancal.com.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.640]  I'm gonna be listening, Alex, you have a great show.
[42:44.640 --> 42:45.480]  Thank you.
[42:45.480 --> 42:46.320]  All right, you too.
[42:46.320 --> 42:48.760]  Well, that was a curve ball from Eric Mancal Muller.
[42:48.760 --> 42:51.480]  Phil Berg, your view on that question.
[42:51.480 --> 42:55.760]  Well, first off, I'm not working secretly for Hillary Clinton.
[42:55.760 --> 42:58.800]  I did support her during the election, but very minor.
[42:58.800 --> 43:00.880]  I mean, I think I gave her $200 or $300
[43:00.880 --> 43:04.280]  nowhere near the limit that you give in the thousands
[43:04.280 --> 43:07.720]  of dollars or $35,000, whatever the number is.
[43:07.720 --> 43:11.520]  I didn't even have a lawn sign on my house for her.
[43:11.520 --> 43:14.000]  I did this because I'm a lifelong Democrat
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.400]  and people say, how can you attack the Democratic Party?
[43:16.400 --> 43:18.320]  I did this because there's nothing more important
[43:18.320 --> 43:20.120]  than our US Constitution.
[43:20.120 --> 43:21.320]  And that's what I'm fighting for.
[43:21.320 --> 43:23.800]  And Obama has walked all over the Constitution.
[43:23.800 --> 43:25.560]  If you think about it, Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[43:25.560 --> 43:27.200]  people have talked to you for 10, 15 years
[43:27.200 --> 43:28.720]  about running for president.
[43:28.720 --> 43:29.560]  And what's he say?
[43:29.560 --> 43:31.920]  He says, I was born in Austria, I'm in the Constitution.
[43:31.920 --> 43:33.880]  Obama hasn't said anything.
[43:33.880 --> 43:36.080]  And for him to come out laughing and joking today
[43:36.080 --> 43:38.200]  on this issue, it's ridiculous.
[43:39.200 --> 43:43.200]  It's not a joking issue, but more significant is his status.
[43:43.200 --> 43:45.400]  And again, it's from his book.
[43:45.400 --> 43:48.240]  It's his status of being adopted in Indonesia.
[43:48.240 --> 43:51.680]  And I'm gonna pursue my efforts here.
[43:51.680 --> 43:54.600]  I could use money if you want to make a contribution.
[43:54.600 --> 43:55.920]  We've been the only one, I believe,
[43:55.920 --> 43:56.880]  in the last two and a half years
[43:56.880 --> 43:59.240]  focused on the adoption issue.
[43:59.240 --> 44:01.440]  Some people are saying, well, I've gotten calls today.
[44:01.440 --> 44:03.800]  They say, well, it shows his father's British,
[44:03.800 --> 44:06.040]  therefore he can't be a natural born.
[44:06.040 --> 44:07.280]  I don't buy that argument.
[44:07.280 --> 44:10.560]  I buy the argument that you deal with the facts
[44:10.560 --> 44:11.400]  at the time.
[44:11.400 --> 44:13.760]  Doesn't your mother just have to be natural born?
[44:13.760 --> 44:16.720]  And then, and of course, the laws have since changed.
[44:16.720 --> 44:19.040]  But at that time in the 60s,
[44:19.040 --> 44:22.880]  did you, you had to be born in the country though,
[44:22.880 --> 44:27.880]  even if one of your parents was an American,
[44:30.040 --> 44:32.600]  or they had to be a certain age.
[44:32.600 --> 44:34.280]  What were the specifics?
[44:34.280 --> 44:37.800]  The specifics were husband and wife, boyfriend, girlfriend,
[44:37.800 --> 44:40.840]  even today, traveling or running anywhere around the world.
[44:40.840 --> 44:42.960]  If both are US citizens, the child born,
[44:42.960 --> 44:44.680]  when it comes back to immigration,
[44:44.680 --> 44:46.960]  that child is considered natural born.
[44:46.960 --> 44:49.680]  The problem you get into is if only one parent
[44:49.680 --> 44:52.080]  is US citizen, and we raise that point
[44:52.080 --> 44:53.480]  that if she was born in Kenya,
[44:53.480 --> 44:56.040]  and I still have the recording from her step-grandmother,
[44:56.040 --> 44:57.320]  who said she was in the hospital
[44:57.320 --> 45:00.400]  when he was born there, August 4, 1961.
[45:00.400 --> 45:02.560]  If only one parent is a US citizen,
[45:02.560 --> 45:04.560]  then you take the US citizen,
[45:04.560 --> 45:06.680]  and that person had to live in this country
[45:06.680 --> 45:09.120]  for 10 straight years, and five of those years
[45:09.120 --> 45:11.080]  had to be after the age of 14.
[45:11.080 --> 45:14.280]  14 and five was 19, she was only 18.
[45:14.280 --> 45:16.480]  So if she, if he was born in Kenya,
[45:16.480 --> 45:18.320]  which I still believe he was,
[45:18.320 --> 45:21.280]  then the mother could not convey natural born status.
[45:21.280 --> 45:22.960]  And some people say, Phil or Mr. Berger,
[45:22.960 --> 45:24.840]  let's, you're playing on technicality.
[45:24.840 --> 45:26.320]  I said, I'm not playing on technicality.
[45:26.320 --> 45:28.360]  Congress established that rule.
[45:28.360 --> 45:31.400]  I think the rule today is if you're 15 plus two years,
[45:31.400 --> 45:34.560]  but Congress establishes that for natural born status.
[45:34.560 --> 45:36.440]  So there's some real questions here.
[45:36.440 --> 45:39.400]  I guess the first thing we have to look at is the hospital,
[45:39.400 --> 45:41.680]  the doctor, see if the doctor was on staff,
[45:41.680 --> 45:43.440]  see what they did, but it was interesting
[45:43.440 --> 45:46.200]  in the last, Victoria, his half sister last week
[45:46.200 --> 45:47.320]  when she was interviewed,
[45:49.080 --> 45:51.440]  Pierce Morgan blew it because he said,
[45:51.440 --> 45:52.400]  he didn't ask the question,
[45:52.400 --> 45:53.720]  how come in two different interviews,
[45:53.720 --> 45:57.200]  you say your brother was born in two different locations.
[45:57.200 --> 45:59.440]  So we have to take a look at this document again.
[45:59.440 --> 46:01.240]  I don't care what this document really is,
[46:01.240 --> 46:04.560]  if ultimately it's valid, he loses his status
[46:04.560 --> 46:06.440]  when he's adopted in Indonesia.
[46:06.440 --> 46:08.520]  You've got a big research network out there.
[46:08.520 --> 46:11.240]  Since we've been on the air together the last 40 minutes,
[46:11.240 --> 46:14.280]  you've pointed out that it says race of father African.
[46:14.280 --> 46:16.440]  At the time they would say,
[46:18.160 --> 46:19.640]  they would use other terms.
[46:20.640 --> 46:22.000]  I believe you're correct there.
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.760]  And we've also blown it up.
[46:23.760 --> 46:26.480]  There's white around all the words,
[46:26.480 --> 46:29.840]  both the signed written text
[46:29.840 --> 46:32.280]  and the typewriter printing.
[46:33.480 --> 46:34.800]  This is very bizarre.
[46:34.800 --> 46:37.840]  And this is a riddle wrapped in an enigma.
[46:37.840 --> 46:39.720]  I want to bring Webster Griffin Tarpley in,
[46:39.720 --> 46:42.880]  who you know well, doctor of history, researcher,
[46:42.880 --> 46:46.920]  economist who's also been looking at this very closely,
[46:46.920 --> 46:49.800]  Genesis host who every Saturday has you do an update.
[46:49.800 --> 46:51.840]  Webster, what's your preliminary view
[46:51.840 --> 46:53.800]  on what's happening here?
[46:53.800 --> 46:56.320]  Well, first of all, this shows that the agitation
[46:56.320 --> 46:57.600]  can lead to results.
[46:57.600 --> 46:59.480]  And people who think that the federal government
[46:59.480 --> 47:02.240]  is beyond their reach and now should now think again,
[47:02.240 --> 47:04.040]  Obama did not want to reveal this
[47:04.040 --> 47:07.680]  and now he's been forced to reveal whatever he has revealed.
[47:07.680 --> 47:10.760]  I think the first step is as Phil has been suggesting,
[47:10.760 --> 47:14.880]  we need to see a detailed analysis of this forgeries.
[47:14.880 --> 47:16.280]  Is it fabricated?
[47:16.280 --> 47:17.120]  Is it real?
[47:17.120 --> 47:18.520]  What's with the name of the doctor?
[47:18.520 --> 47:20.400]  What if these people are still alive?
[47:20.400 --> 47:23.680]  Can they provide some enlightenment?
[47:23.680 --> 47:25.680]  As Phil also points out,
[47:25.680 --> 47:28.360]  the really big question is the naturalization
[47:28.360 --> 47:32.240]  of Barack Hussein Obama, if that really is his name,
[47:32.240 --> 47:35.080]  in Indonesia as Barry Sotoro,
[47:35.080 --> 47:38.120]  the son of Lolo Sotoro or Sotero,
[47:38.120 --> 47:42.840]  who was the guy that his mother married.
[47:42.840 --> 47:45.240]  And therefore, by all accounts,
[47:45.240 --> 47:49.680]  has became at that point a naturalized citizen of Indonesia.
[47:49.680 --> 47:52.840]  I would also extend a broader standard.
[47:52.840 --> 47:54.880]  If you want to be president,
[47:54.880 --> 47:56.400]  it means that you want to get your hand
[47:56.400 --> 47:57.800]  on the thermonuclear button.
[47:57.800 --> 48:01.120]  That gives you life or death power over virtually everybody
[48:01.120 --> 48:03.480]  in the United States and many people in the world.
[48:03.480 --> 48:05.680]  At that point, there is no private sphere.
[48:05.680 --> 48:07.160]  We want to see everything.
[48:07.160 --> 48:08.480]  We want to see his records
[48:08.480 --> 48:12.320]  from the prep school Punahau in Hawaii.
[48:12.320 --> 48:15.320]  We want to see the Occidental College records.
[48:15.320 --> 48:17.720]  We want to see the Columbia University records.
[48:17.720 --> 48:19.600]  We have this guy, Wayne Root,
[48:19.600 --> 48:22.840]  who says that he was in that year at Columbia.
[48:22.840 --> 48:24.120]  He's asked all the alumni.
[48:24.120 --> 48:27.200]  Nobody ever heard of Obama in that graduating class.
[48:27.200 --> 48:29.840]  We want to see the Harvard story.
[48:29.840 --> 48:32.520]  We want to see his tax returns.
[48:32.520 --> 48:34.360]  We want to see his records
[48:34.360 --> 48:36.440]  at this Business International Corporation,
[48:36.440 --> 48:40.760]  which is a notorious CIA front, as long as it existed.
[48:40.760 --> 48:44.280]  We want to see his State Department file
[48:44.280 --> 48:47.760]  regarding the visas and trips that he took.
[48:47.760 --> 48:50.440]  For example, did he go to Pakistan
[48:50.440 --> 48:53.560]  early on with a couple of schoolmates?
[48:53.560 --> 48:54.960]  And by the way, Webster,
[48:54.960 --> 48:58.560]  you're going to be in studio for an hour and a half Friday
[48:58.560 --> 49:02.960]  with us here in town, breaking this down
[49:02.960 --> 49:06.440]  as we work on a documentary film together.
[49:06.440 --> 49:08.680]  But my big issue here is, folks,
[49:08.680 --> 49:10.480]  they've been covering up his whole record,
[49:10.480 --> 49:14.920]  like never before, with anybody else in American politics.
[49:14.920 --> 49:16.800]  They wouldn't release this.
[49:16.800 --> 49:18.800]  They said that the receipt of a certificate
[49:18.800 --> 49:21.040]  was the certificate, played dumb about it.
[49:21.040 --> 49:23.840]  Now they've released a supposed long form.
[49:23.840 --> 49:25.640]  Does anybody in their right mind think
[49:25.640 --> 49:27.360]  that if he was really born in Kenya,
[49:27.360 --> 49:31.280]  that they wouldn't produce a fake birth certificate now?
[49:31.280 --> 49:33.800]  Because 62% of the American people
[49:33.800 --> 49:35.200]  don't believe he was born here
[49:35.200 --> 49:39.440]  in the USA Today poll that came out yesterday.
[49:39.440 --> 49:41.920]  Does anyone think when the government's been caught
[49:41.920 --> 49:44.680]  forging documents, making fake newscasts,
[49:44.680 --> 49:49.680]  that they are not capable of this?
[49:49.680 --> 49:52.240]  Webster Tarpley, then we'll get Phil Burk's take on that.
[49:52.240 --> 49:53.480]  They've been lying the whole time.
[49:53.480 --> 49:54.800]  And the interesting thing is,
[49:54.800 --> 49:57.000]  now you see what a real birth certificate
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.120]  might look like if this is authentic.
[49:59.120 --> 50:00.200]  That's a big if.
[50:00.200 --> 50:01.560]  You see that it's typewritten.
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.000]  It has signatures on there in pen and ink.
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.120]  It's got a whole series of about 20 to 25 categories
[50:08.120 --> 50:08.960]  of information.
[50:08.960 --> 50:09.800]  Where are the feet?
[50:09.800 --> 50:10.640]  Where are the feet?
[50:10.640 --> 50:13.320]  That's what we were demanding the whole time.
[50:13.320 --> 50:14.240]  Yes, there's that too.
[50:14.240 --> 50:17.000]  Some states have it, I guess some states don't.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.800]  The authenticity of that document
[50:18.800 --> 50:21.920]  now has to be established by experts in...
[50:21.920 --> 50:23.760]  By the way, notice it's not a scan,
[50:23.760 --> 50:25.600]  so experts could do that properly.
[50:25.600 --> 50:26.480]  It's a photo.
[50:26.480 --> 50:27.520]  You can see it curving.
[50:27.520 --> 50:28.960]  It's a photo.
[50:28.960 --> 50:31.280]  That's even more suspicious.
[50:31.280 --> 50:33.000]  All right, all of those things
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.440]  have to come out in the wash.
[50:34.440 --> 50:36.680]  But again, the further dimension,
[50:36.680 --> 50:38.320]  what's within Indonesia?
[50:38.320 --> 50:40.440]  And again, the standard has to be,
[50:40.440 --> 50:43.360]  you want your finger on the thermonuclear button, great.
[50:43.360 --> 50:45.160]  We get to know everything.
[50:45.160 --> 50:46.960]  And this applies to everybody.
[50:46.960 --> 50:47.960]  It applies to Obama.
[50:47.960 --> 50:49.400]  Anybody running for president.
[50:49.400 --> 50:51.800]  Anybody and everybody running for president.
[50:51.800 --> 50:53.360]  Well, we know to join the FBI,
[50:53.360 --> 50:55.960]  you've got to give them the long form birth certificate.
[50:55.960 --> 50:57.600]  Let's get final comments from Phil Byrne,
[50:57.600 --> 51:00.640]  Webster Tarpley, then your phone calls coming up.
[51:00.640 --> 51:02.560]  Do you want to learn more about preparing
[51:02.560 --> 51:03.840]  for the hard times ahead?
[51:03.840 --> 51:06.520]  Have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid

[52:03.040 --> 52:05.440]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[52:05.440 --> 52:07.440]  The US government is a Ponzi scheme
[52:07.440 --> 52:09.800]  that relies on the Treasury continuously selling
[52:09.800 --> 52:13.240]  large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[52:13.240 --> 52:16.640]  With Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[52:16.640 --> 52:18.600]  in order to rebuild its own nation
[52:18.600 --> 52:21.280]  and the US antagonizing China by calling them
[52:21.280 --> 52:23.560]  currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve,
[52:23.560 --> 52:26.640]  which is already buying about 70% of US Treasuries,
[52:26.640 --> 52:29.400]  will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries.
[52:29.400 --> 52:31.840]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association
[52:31.840 --> 52:34.720]  believe that the US dollar will soon become worthless
[52:34.720 --> 52:36.680]  and Americans will see the purchasing power
[52:36.680 --> 52:38.880]  of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[52:38.880 --> 52:42.240]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up
[52:42.240 --> 52:47.240]  for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[52:47.240 --> 52:49.720]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda
[52:49.720 --> 52:53.720]  in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us
[52:53.720 --> 52:57.040]  to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[52:59.560 --> 53:02.200]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems
[53:02.200 --> 53:04.680]  are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[53:04.680 --> 53:07.360]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over six years

[53:18.960 --> 53:21.240]  that purify water by removing chlorine,

[53:23.520 --> 53:26.440]  to non-detectable levels and remove harmful chemicals

[53:56.960 --> 53:59.120]  That's goberkey.com today.
[53:59.120 --> 54:27.120]  We're going to be taking your phone calls coming up in the next hour, toll free number to join us 800-259-9231. I'd like to get your take on the birth certificate question. That's the topic. Please only call in on that subject because I really want to focus in on that 1-800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us today.
[54:27.120 --> 54:42.400]  We're talking to attorney Phil Berg and Webster Riventarpley, really two of the first people that I heard ever question the birth certificate after the Clinton people did and they've certainly been covering it up. $2 million spent blocking Phil Berg.
[54:42.400 --> 55:02.400]  All I know is the media needs to answer for this. All of them that said that he'd released his long form when it was this receipt computer printout itself that folks, experts said was his fake and $3 bill. And now this, or is there a bigger si-op that they put out more fake stuff to keep the controversy going?
[55:02.400 --> 55:17.400]  Not that it's not a controversy and not important, but compared to dollar plunging and everything else, it's kind of like going after Clinton for sex instead of missile secrets. Final comment on that, Webster Riventarpley, I want to get Phil Berg's take.
[55:17.400 --> 55:35.400]  I think the overriding issue is the blackmail issue and the blackmail issue subsumes the things that you're mentioning. You have to imagine if Obama is really not constitutionally qualified, if he was naturalized into Indonesia or if this birth certificate is a fake, he is blackmailable.
[55:35.400 --> 55:48.400]  Why did he reverse his field on bombing Libya? He told Senator Luga 48 hours before the bombing, there will be no military action against Libya. Then he turns around and does it. Does British intelligence, for example, have proof that he was born in Kenya?
[55:48.400 --> 56:06.400]  All of these questions. That's why we have to know everything, because if the president is blackmailable, he can't be president, and that impacts every issue under the sun. And I think this is a way for people leftists and others, centrist, independents, to understand if the president can be blackmailed, that is a constitutional crisis.
[56:06.400 --> 56:13.400]  And we're still in a major constitutional crisis over this question of Obama's qualifications.
[56:13.400 --> 56:29.400]  But going back, the reason you mentioned Kenya and British intel, that was a British holding a colonial state still at the time that he was born. Any questions or comments for Phil Berg, Webster?
[56:29.400 --> 56:50.400]  Well, just congratulations. I mean, Phil, after all, was the first person to take this to the US Supreme Court. We were there. I was happy to be an eyewitness, a supporter. On August 21, 2008, when Phil went to the Supreme Court here in Washington, it was before the Democratic National Convention, raising these issues.
[56:50.400 --> 57:06.400]  And they always did it. He was always rejected on standing. And I would urge anybody in Congress, anybody in Congress who has a committee, could issue a subpoena simply demanding to see more, the State Department file and some of these other things.
[57:06.400 --> 57:20.400]  Yeah, because if they faked this, then they would try to, they were smart, fake it in the files themselves. We need to have those files seized by Congress to really root out what's happening. Phil Berg has raced all over the country for two and a half years, trying to get to the bottom of this.
[57:20.400 --> 57:28.400]  And I think, Phil, you said it best. Why would they spend $2 million closing comments? Why would they spend money blocking you instead of just releasing this thing?
[57:28.400 --> 57:38.400]  That's right. I mean, why spend the money? Why fight every lawsuit? Just released this two years ago, two and a half years ago, when I first started, because there's more behind this.
[57:38.400 --> 57:48.400]  Like I stated, even if he was born in Hawaii, he loses his status when he's adopted in Indonesia. And that's the key we have to look at. We have to look carefully at this birth certificate.
[57:48.400 --> 57:58.400]  I don't think anyone had a race of African back in 1961. There's just so many issues here and Obama comes out laughing today. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
[57:58.400 --> 58:10.400]  You know, the document they had, they might have changed the law in Hawaii, but that long form, the short form certification of live birth would not have gotten your child registered for Little League and would not have gotten you a passport.
[58:10.400 --> 58:18.400]  I think they recently changed that. So there's a lot more that we have to talk about.
[58:40.400 --> 58:49.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:11.400 --> 59:19.400]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[59:19.400 --> 59:26.400]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[59:26.400 --> 59:42.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[59:42.400 --> 59:53.400]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun. So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[59:53.400 --> 01:00:00.400]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:22.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:33.400]  Alright, we're now into hour number two. Lord Christopher Monkton on the plunging dollar, open announcements of global government, the latest plans to bring in an eco-green tyranny.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:47.400]  He'll be joining us for about 30 minutes coming up at the bottom of the hour. I won't open the phones up right now about Obama's press conference laughing, giggling, finally releasing what he says is the full birth certificate, not the fake receipt.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:56.400]  Now remember, they said there was no other certificate. This was it. And that really fueled this. They're not stupid. They knew that would do that.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:04.400]  Why do you think they did that? To make this a political diversion later to say, see, I really was born here? Or have they had time to fake it?
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:17.400]  I mean, this is a scythe. There's no doubt. And I trust Donald Trump about as far as I could throwing. They've analyzed his record. Trump's donation history shows democratic favoritism.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:30.400]  Is he a ringer? Like somebody in a Don King fight? We've also got Miss America sexually molested by TSA. We've also got top Mexican drug lord iTraffic cocaine for the U.S. government.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:38.400]  We've got coming up pretty soon. Bernanke's going to give his speech about QE2 and interest rates, big news on that front.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.400]  But I want to take a lot of your phone calls in this 30 minute block. Chris in Florida, you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:59.400]  Hey, thanks. Yeah, I was just thinking a lot that Trump basically is just, they're using him to pull the first certificate out. And then, you know, he's probably going to announce on his show that he's backed, you know, back down.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:04.400]  And that was his duty to bring the certificate out. So the dumbed down Americans will believe that.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:12.400]  I'm very proud of myself for bringing this to a head. And it's true. Trump running around did bring this to a head.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:19.400]  That's a joke. I don't want to waste too much of your time. But thanks. And I, you know, I appreciate everything you do. And I'm trying to wake people up.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:29.400]  Well, I mean, let me ask you, what's your gut? Because why didn't they just release this two and a half years ago? It wasn't so they could make this a controversy and then discredit people?
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:37.400]  Because I don't think that's going to work. I think it's going to make it bigger now. Nobody believes what government says or puts out. Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:48.400]  Like I said, the sky is blue. Nobody would buy it. Even if it's the truth, nobody's going to buy this. Or did they get desperate when right at two thirds of the American people so they don't believe Obama was born here?
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:03:05.400]  Yeah, well, my gut says that, you know, he's a fraud. I mean, I've always thought that. And basically, yeah, that's it. You know, I think he's a fraud. And I think, yeah, they think he's going to bash her in their face.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:13.400]  All right, I appreciate you joining us, Chris. Moses in Arizona, maybe you can lead us out of this wilderness, Moses. What's your view?
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:24.400]  Hello, Alex, and thank you for taking my call. I have several things. Number one, did you ever see that newspaper article when he was running for Senate and it said Kenyan born?
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.400]  Yes, yes. And I believe that that was a manufactured article.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.400]  Okay, I wasn't sure about that. But that's been going around a lot.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:41.400]  I know his grandmother said he was born in Kenya. That's really what started all this. And his wife at Democratic Functions had said he went back to his homeland of Kenya.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:48.400]  And your homelands where you're born in Schwarzenegger's homeland is Austria. Why would she say his homeland was Kenya?
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:56.400]  We can play that video clip if folks haven't seen it. I mean, look, they started all this. Why didn't they release it? What do you think is happening?
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.400]  Well, you know how the states are contemplating passing these birther bills?
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.400]  Yes.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.400]  Do you think that correlates in any way? Like heading them off at the pass?
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:18.400]  And then another thing, also, I was born in Manhattan, New York, like Mr. Trump was. And on my birth certificate, it states exactly who I am and who my parents were.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.400]  But as far as the race is concerned, on both of my parents, it said Puerto Rican.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:33.400]  Now, if memory serves me correctly, they used words back then, and I know the states are different, but they used words such as Negro or the actual place of birth.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.400]  Now, wouldn't that reflect Kenyan on Obama's father's part?
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:47.400]  Exactly. No, no, no. I mean, look, common sense. It would say Kenyan or it would say Negro. And because Anglo, Negroes become some type of pejorative or insult.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:54.400]  And Anglo isn't. It's just a scientific name. I mean, all it means, I guess, in Latin is dark.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:20.400]  So great points. Why does it say African? We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:31.400]  Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:38.400]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:47.400]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:06:00.400]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America. The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America3.com.

[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:12.400]  People have had to literally run for their lives. Folks, this is Steve Shank with E-Foods Direct.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:18.400]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think. You must act automatically.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:24.400]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight? No time to think. Just act automatically.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:33.400]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:48.400]  You need a 5-day extreme emergency kit. With serious supplies and real food to secure to adults for 5 days, this powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995 from E-Foods Direct.

[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:04.400]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:09.400]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.400]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.400]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:24.400]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:30.400]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.400]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.400]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:44.400]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:48.400]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.400]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:58.400]  Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prismplanet.tv.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.400]  National television's airwaves breaking in over every major program.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:30.400]  Broadcast, TV, cable, you name it.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.400]  Breaking into the soap operas, breaking into the morning news shows,
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.400]  not talking about some type of new war or some crisis or disaster,
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:47.400]  but laughing and giggling and saying that he was born in Hawaii and releasing his birth certificate.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:50.400]  But I thought they released that two and a half years ago, they said.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:55.400]  There was no other certificate that that little receipt was it.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.400]  Very bizarre.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.400]  The Federal Reserve has put out its press release just minutes ago.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.400]  It's up at infowars.com.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.400]  Fed leaves rates bond program unchanged.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:13.400]  Bernanke Q&A went on to state that the Federal Reserve is signaling
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:19.400]  that its 600 billion treasury bond buying program will end in June.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:26.400]  So they're not going to continue QE2 into QE3, at least they say for now,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.400]  as planned because the economy has strengthened and companies are starting to hire more.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:36.400]  Well, actually, you look at the numbers, unemployment's going up, they put out some fake numbers,
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.400]  and we've seen a lot of jobs being lost, housing prices still going down,
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.400]  the dollar plunging, gas prices exploding.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.400]  No one who's being honest says this economy's getting better,
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.400]  but they say everything is great.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:55.400]  So we'll talk more in the next hour with a financial expert about what these announcements signal,
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.400]  but they are going to keep interest rates low.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:03.400]  This with Europe raising their interest rates, that's triggering people to buy European treasury notes
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.400]  and not U.S. treasury notes.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.400]  So who's going to buy them at the Federal Reserve isn't going to be doing it,
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.400]  and we have their full press release up there as well.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.400]  Also later, I'm going to get into this huge article at infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:25.400]  on the heels of Wacovia and Wells Fargo admitting the laundering of $376 billion of narcotics money
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.400]  and leasing the narcotics aircraft.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:35.400]  Top Mexican drug lord in Chicago, Cortes, says eye traffic cocaine for the U.S. government,
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:40.400]  and he's bringing forward the documents that he was part of an approved cartel
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.400]  to bring narcotics into the United States, and that's what the drug war is.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:49.400]  It's a war against those that don't pay their cut, and that's why they make drugs illegal
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.400]  to jack up the prices so the big central banks make more money.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:58.400]  And by the way, I can play Fox News saying it's good that our troops help grow opium in Afghanistan
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:04.400]  that's a 13-fold increase from what it was in 2001, 93% of the world market,
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.400]  and they cut to a Marine Corps colonel admitting they help grow the opium and help protect it
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400]  because if they don't, Al Qaeda will get it.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.400]  Give me a break, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  This is just so incredible.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:23.400]  They keep it illegal just like they made alcohol illegal so they could treble the price of it during prohibition.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.400]  And there was more alcoholism, and it corrupted the police.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:31.400]  They know exactly what they're doing, so that big report there.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.400]  But getting your take on Obama coming out with a birth certificate,
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:40.400]  issue Ron in Illinois up in Obama Land.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.400]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.400]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.400]  Good.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400]  That's good.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.400]  Hey, before I get into that, I just want to say real quick,
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.400]  there's some information that I came into in case anybody's looking to kind of show some people what's going on out there.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:59.400]  If you go to the Illinois Attorney General website and go into their history link right on there,
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:07.400]  it says that their actual job is to prosecute all actions necessary for the protections and revenues of the crown.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:13.400]  I couldn't believe it when I read it, but if you haven't seen it, you need to go check it out.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400]  Into the Obama thing.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.400]  I love what you do.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:22.400]  All the information that's coming out, I think it's such an info warrior bomb.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.400]  But the only thing that I wanted to say was, is can you tell me, can you speak to,
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:32.400]  I mean, if the lever code went into place back when, and you talk about it, you know,
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.400]  the US being, the United States being a corporation, hypothetically,
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:41.400]  I see it as literally a corporation, is it not true then that he doesn't, I mean,
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:48.400]  he could hold, you know, the office at McDonald's or Walmart and still have all the qualifications in order to hold that position.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:54.400]  Well, look, at the end of the day, Obama is a teleprompter reading frontman who will take all the political blame,
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.400]  and then he'll just put in a new guy when he's worn out.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.400]  And it goes on and on.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.400]  That's why the globalists are upset is because for the first time in modern history,
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:08.400]  the actual banking cartels are being identified instead of just the puppets.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.400]  And so that's why the system loves this birth certificate issue.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.400]  And we've been forced to cover it over the years reluctantly.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:19.400]  I mean, I've been criticized for not covering it more and being somewhat ambivalent.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.400]  I know he gave up his name and became Barry Citerro.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.400]  He admits that and that needs to be looked into.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.400]  I know his records are very secretive.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.400]  I know his whole family has foundation and intelligence agency connections.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:37.400]  But even though that's juicy and interesting, at the end of the day, I'd rather talk about dollar devaluation.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.400]  I'd rather talk about the TSA and the police state.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.400]  I'd rather talk about all those issues.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:49.400]  But yes, the District of Columbia operates under administrative law, which is the global government system.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:58.400]  And yes, they have seen federal court cases where they argue admiralty and they say we're under an emergency since 33 war powers.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.400]  And so there is some truth to that.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.400]  Then there's others that say it's a pure corporation, registered in Delaware.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.400]  That's not really true.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:11.400]  You know, there's some rumors also kind of floating around, but there is some truth to it.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.400]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:23.400]  You've got the continuity of government, Pentagon, COG, administrative, dictatorial system running in parallel with the old republic.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.400]  And now they're just tearing up the track of the old system so that we can't get back to it.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.400]  But it's always there in our hearts and minds and through common law practice.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.400]  And that gets all into law theory.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.400]  But at the end of the day, it's all about having the moral high ground and taking action.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.400]  So much of this is just lawless hubris.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.400]  I mean, the TSA legally can't stick their hands down your pants.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:52.400]  I've had congress people on constitutional lawyers, district attorneys, county attorneys from big, big cities like San Francisco,
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.400]  saying this is illegal for them to stick their hand down your pants.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:00.400]  A sworn officer can't do it unless there's an emergency and they saw you cram a gun down there.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.400]  You can't do it.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:07.400]  It's illegal to have uncalibrated radiation machines in there that there's no radiology tests being done.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400]  That violates federal and state law.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.400]  They just do it.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.400]  So much, I mean, the Army running checkpoints all over the country.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.400]  The Marine Corps doing it.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.400]  It totally violates Posse Commentatus.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.400]  They haven't gotten rid of the whole act.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:22.400]  They've put a few loopholes in it, but they don't care.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.400]  They're just doing it.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:30.400]  Like two years ago when the governor of Tennessee said there's checkpoints with the Army searching cars on highways.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.400]  No, get out of here.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.400]  You can't do that.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.400]  And the Pentagon said, we're under Homeland Security.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.400]  Take a hike.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.400]  That was in the Tennessee Papers.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.400]  So, I mean, you can argue what Lincoln did was unconstitutional and illegal.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.400]  He did it.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.400]  He had soldiers that would follow orders.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.400]  And it's the same thing here, folks.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:56.400]  And if we don't speak out and point it out and we go along with it, even under duress, that sets the common law precedent.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.400]  Doesn't make it legitimate.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:05.400]  You know, they could say, well, under the law blacks are two thirds human and we can hook you up to a plowshare like a donkey.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:11.400]  And it wasn't until blacks started fighting back and saying, I'm a human that they got some of their liberties.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.400]  I mean, liberty is not given to you folks.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.400]  It's taken.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.400]  You need to understand that Frederick Douglass put it that way.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.400]  In fact, pull me up the Frederick Douglass quote.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.400]  I'll just give you a quote.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.400]  Liberty is not given.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.400]  It's taken.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.400]  Okay.
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.400]  And the answer in 1984 is 1776.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.400]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.400]  You're on the air, John.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.400]  Oh, hello, Alex.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.400]  How are you doing today?
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.400]  Good.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.400]  Yes.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:41.400]  I just wanted to say really quick that here in Vancouver, there was a mistake not Ohio,
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.400]  that the radiation is now 99 times over the legal limit.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:52.400]  And about the birth certificate, I just wanted to say why he's making such a fuss about not showing it.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.400]  I mean, could you imagine how easy it is to just fake one?
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.400]  I mean, I don't see why he's making such a big deal out about it, you know.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:03.400]  So you think they hyped it up this whole time to later make it a political diversion?
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.400]  Exactly.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.400]  I mean, do you know how easy it is?
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.400]  People on the streets can do it.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.400]  They can fake it.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.400]  It's very simple.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:18.400]  Or they've got people they pay off in the different state bureaus, the hospitals and the Bureau of Vital Statistics.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.400]  They can get a copy of a dead person who died young and then operate under their name.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.400]  Exactly.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.400]  Exactly.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.400]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.400]  And I hope you have a good time.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.400]  God bless you and your family.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.400]  Thank you, John.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.400]  Good points.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.400]  Justin in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:42.400]  Yeah, I was calling about the Trump thing and about the birth certificate thing.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.400]  Well, welcome.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.400]  Go ahead.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:50.400]  Yeah, it's clearly like the last call I just said, of course, at the sideshow.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.400]  I mean, they want to get your eye off the ball.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:59.400]  And Donald Trump, as far as he's concerned, he's a shill, of course, because the Liberty movements on the move out there.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.400]  And it's just clear that the establishment is flailing now.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.400]  I mean, you know, it's all going to be a big show.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:12.400]  Well, notice that the media keeps saying, oh, Trump's getting tough.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.400]  He's got the leadership we need.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.400]  He'll fight.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:21.400]  Well, Trump is this Chuck E. Schumer supporter involved in all sort of inside sweetheart deals.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.400]  He's a multi-state casino owner.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.400]  And say what you want about casinos, folks.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.400]  That's a dirty business.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.400]  And he's slick.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.400]  Sure.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.400]  I'm tired of slick talk.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:39.400]  I'd rather have somebody who isn't the best speaker like Ron Paul, who stands on what they believe in as a constitutionalist.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.400]  Donald Trump supports imminent domain, grabbing all ladies' houses.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.400]  He's involved in all sorts of questionable penny stocks.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:52.400]  I mean, Donald Trump is a big CD person and he supported socialist health care.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.400]  Now he's saying a lot of things that make sense, but it's a pitch.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:03.400]  But Americans, some of them like to think that there's a magic secret bullet out there that's going to fix everything for him.
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.400]  And I'm sorry, folks, it didn't Donald Trump.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.400]  The Ron Paul thing.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.400]  All these, all the people out there, you know, all the ones who are, he's too old or he can't win.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.400]  Well, they need to understand that it's the message, not the man, you know.
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:22.400]  And who thinks that Ron Paul wouldn't put a like-minded person to his right hand anyway?
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:27.400]  Well, regardless, Ron Paul jogs, rides bikes every day, eats like a bird.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:31.400]  And he's probably at the body of about a 68-year-old, not a 75-year-old.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.400]  And, you know, he'd get in there and be out of office in one term.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:38.400]  You know, he was 80 or 84.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.400]  But again, Ron Paul isn't going to save us.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.400]  He's one step towards that.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.400]  We've got to take the states back through 10th Amendment nullification.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:52.400]  Great points, Justin, Steve, Tim, Jamie, Tim and others.

[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:21.280]  In other news, US broadens Mexico travel warning. That's right, American citizens being targeted
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:28.120]  for murder and kidnapping in Mexico. Our gallant little friend of the South, the failed state.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:32.960]  Also top Mexican drug lord, iTraffic Cocaine for the US government. That comes out in
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:40.000]  the federal court. That's up on infowars.com. Big investigative report by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.480]  And now they just kind of hide it in plain view on Fox News. Yes, the US military, Marines
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:48.880]  and army guard the poppy and give them fertilizer. And it's shipped out, but we're not going
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:53.320]  to discuss that if we catch you with it, you're going to one of our private prisons owned
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:25:02.240]  by big banks that launder the money. Is that clear? Because we're anti-drug here in America.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:09.480]  And Wacovia and Wells Fargo, you made 376 bill. You laundered it. You're leasing the
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:16.520]  aircraft for the drugs. You admit it. We're going to pay 0.3% fine of 100 million on the
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:23.200]  376 bill. Oh boy, that's a good business. If you can get it, I wonder if you get caught
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:29.400]  with some heroin or cocaine and you're going to pay a fine that's 0.3 the value of it.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.480]  No, you're going to probably get billy clubbed on the head. You're going to go to a prison.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:37.680]  You're going to get gang raped. And then the taxpayer is going to pay for your HIV infection,
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:41.280]  which is even better for the globalists. It's all part of the land, the free home of the
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:45.720]  brain. I'm supposed to be naive here. When I pull up to an illegal police checkpoint,
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.960]  they go, got any alcohol or drugs in there? And I stick my head out three separate times
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.040]  and say, no, I don't use the products your bosses ship. And ooh, they get mad. Get out
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:58.200]  of the car. I'm like, great. I'm a drug dealer like you. And you know the government's bringing
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:02.200]  the drugs in officer. Leave me alone. Don't destroy America and your children's future.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:07.120]  All right, get back in your car. Get out of here. I don't care what you do to me. I don't
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.720]  care. I know you bring it in and I'm done playing games with you. I'm through with it.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:17.720]  I know you run the terrorist. I'm sick of it. It was all over the news yesterday. Well,
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:24.400]  yes, the top al-Qaeda in Pakistan is MI6 running the attacks and killing people. But so what?
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:28.400]  And yeah, the head of al-Qaeda meets secretly at the Pentagon and the hijackers were trained
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:34.880]  at US bases. I mean, on and on and on. I don't believe any of it. Obama might be from England.
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:39.960]  He might be from Canada. I don't care. He's a teleprompter reader. He looks nothing like
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:44.600]  his father. Of course, it's all a big lie. I don't know what the lie is, but they've
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:52.000]  been covering it up and telling you that that computer printout was his birth certificate
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.960]  for over two years and now they've released one that doesn't even have the vital statistics
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:01.600]  on it. I was noticing all of them. I don't know. And now his race is African. I never
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:07.080]  heard of that. I mean, that's something that came out in the 70s and 80s. Folks, something's
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:13.840]  going on here and it's like designed to make us focus on it. So I'm being forced to cover
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.600]  it because everybody's obsessed with it. Remember two years ago, I get criticized for not really
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.600]  talking about it. I had a few guests on. I'm getting tired of it, but we got to cover it
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:27.720]  because by covering it, we can show people the full spectrum of what's going on. I'm
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:33.640]  getting mad now. Who's up next here? Stephen in Florida here on the air. Go ahead.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:40.160]  Yeah. Good afternoon, Alex. I want to give my take on this birth certificate issue. And
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.760]  then if you have time, I want to relate a conversation I had recently with a neighbor
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.840]  about this six year old girl in New Orleans, his mother. You just recently interviewed
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:53.280]  about this molestation by the TSA. But here's my take on this. You know, I was thinking
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:28:00.680]  about, you know, you've covered at length how back co-opted the Tea Party slash Patriot
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:07.400]  Movement, basically to notify it and, you know, put their own spin on it. And I think
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.760]  in the same respect, what's going on here is these people have taken, you know, people
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.680]  don't understand America. The media, as you brought out, is run by the Pentagon. You know,
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:23.160]  it's all about psi ops and why you call your site info wars. And they don't understand
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.200]  how propaganda works and how they're masters at manipulating people's thinking to get them
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:33.160]  to react in a certain way. But I think this is where what they're doing is taking a legitimate
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:41.720]  issue of this guy's birth and co-opting it in order to make it, you know, in a sense,
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:46.920]  a non-issue by saying, well, we brought it out now. So, you know, we've neutralized
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:52.600]  this. But more importantly, as you brought out to make it a diversionary tactic from
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.920]  the bigger issues of which this is just like the tip of this, the iceberg.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:03.240]  And because Obama is wrong on wars, torture, the economy, the insider behavior, the government
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:08.600]  health care, the waivers for his buddies, because he is just on every front plunging,
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:14.040]  this can be a little fake wind for him. And then it further politicizes stuff. So now
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:18.920]  if you say Barack Obama hired the head of GE and then signed waivers for their power
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.000]  plants, they're like, oh, yeah, just like the birth certificate. Hey, the sky's blue.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.800]  And next you're going to say Obama doesn't have a birth certificate. Now, what was your
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:32.840]  comment on the other issue? Well, I want to say that I talked to a neighbor of mine and
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:38.120]  basically what he said when I was discussing the TSA arresting children, well, but if the
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:43.720]  parents have the chip loaded down with drugs, sure, why not? Oh, exactly. I mean, and now
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:47.400]  they got TSA on the streets and he'll let his wife and daughter have this done to him.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:52.360]  And next is proctology exams. They're actually talking about that. We're on the march, the
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:57.640]  the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.440]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:12.840]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:22.680]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:32.680]  every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:39.720]  where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.

[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:04.840]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:09.960]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.840]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:20.520]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.920]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:28.840]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:32.360]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:36.040]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:40.920]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.600]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:50.200]  one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:05.960]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:11.480]  opportunity, and recognize risk. Saving means to make money. The Calben Pure Soap Company can
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:16.840]  save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated

[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:26.760]  that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:32.440]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:36.760]  and deteriorating clothing called lint. If you want something better, if you want something
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:41.160]  you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog

[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:33.560]  All right, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:37.720]  We're here live a little bit into the next hour. Lord Christopher Monkton is going to be our guest
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:42.760]  and a host of issues, economics, the latest green movements move to seize control of the
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:49.640]  infrastructure, also the royal wedding. And we may be a little bit of a disagreement on that.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.120]  I was asking him, you know, I know we're having him back on this week to continue our interview
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:57.560]  of last week was around a time, but I said, what are some issues you want to raise? You said,
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:03.960]  well, the royal wedding. And his point is sovereignty is under such attack that it makes
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:09.960]  people hang out the British flag, you know, the UK flag. If it makes them think about sovereignty
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:16.600]  against the EU modern bureaucratic royalty, it's a positive thing. So I do see that facet.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:22.840]  My larger issue was the royals and Prince Charles and Philip and carbon tax promoting and
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:27.400]  one child policy promoting everything that Lord Monkton is diametrically opposed to. Also,
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:33.320]  my issue with the royalist over in England, you know, is obviously it was the house of,
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:39.160]  well, it was the lords that brought the out of control monarchy to heal in 1215 with Magna Carta.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:44.440]  And of course, so many of the lords in the House of Commons supported the 1776 move. It wasn't
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:50.680]  until King George III traveled, of course, to parliament and demanded they launch the war.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.640]  So there's a very diverse view over in England. We'll try to decipher and break some of that down.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:03.320]  But Lord Christopher Monkton is a hereditary peer of the crown. And of course, he is also the third
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:07.720]  viacount of Monkton and Brentially is a British politician, public speaker, former newspaper
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:11.720]  editor, hereditary peer, formerly member of the conservative party, former head of it.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:18.760]  Now he's back in it standing for parliament in Scotland. Monkton has been the again,
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:24.360]  leader of the party. He served in conservative central office and was one of the top advisors on
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.840]  science and policy to Margaret Thatcher. And he's also written some of the biggest newspapers
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:34.040]  in England, the Sunday Telegraph, the evening standard newspapers. But before we get into
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:38.840]  all that, Lord Monkton and the subtleties of what's happening over in England and the big royal
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:43.640]  wedding that everybody's so excited about, I think over here, more than over there. Before we go there,
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:48.600]  what's your view of this whole birth certificate issue and Obama coming out and breaking into
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:53.480]  television programming to say that here's my birth certificate. I thought they'd released it
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.560]  two and a half years ago and they said there was no long form. Now they're contradicting
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.720]  themselves. I've never been a birther, but I've been forced to investigate it a bit. And I think
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:08.600]  it's ambiguous. What's your view? I had a look at this a couple of years ago because somebody sent
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:15.000]  me what they said was a Kenyan birth certificate for Obama. I looked at it and superficially,
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.280]  it all looked very plausible. Then I checked a few things out and it was clear that somebody
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:27.000]  had just made it up. And so there's probably a lot of misdirection on all sides going on this.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:33.560]  What I did find out was that Obama's lawyers have spent millions over the last few years
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:41.000]  shutting down inquiries into his past. You couldn't reasonably get his birth certificate.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.600]  You couldn't get his school record, his college record. All of this was sealed. Now in Britain,
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:51.800]  that would be unthinkable. We're not a democracy anymore, but we do still expect our public
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:58.600]  representatives to have all their career and all their documentation on file where we can
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:03.480]  have a look at it. The idea of sealing it so that ordinary people can't see his birth certificate,
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.160]  and that of course is what went on for a couple of years, is quite extraordinary.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:13.800]  So I'm not a birther either, but I can tell you quite a nice little story about this. I was speaking
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:20.680]  in a Tea Party rally in Washington last year, and I started out by saying, welcome to America,
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:26.200]  land of opportunity. You can be born in Kenya and end up as president of the United States,
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:31.400]  and they all laughed politely enough. But the press went ballistic, and they came rushing
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:37.000]  up to me after my speech, and they said, oh, do you believe that Obama was born in Kenya? I said,
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.040]  look, I haven't the faintest idea of where Obama was born, but I am fascinated at how
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:47.080]  incurious you in the media are about his background given how much of it's been sealed.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:54.360]  But let me explain. That ha ha ha noise that you heard when I told what we are the right
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:38:00.280]  called a joke is what we are the right called laughter. May I introduce you to the concept?
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:06.120]  It's something you might like to do more of. Well, I've been impressed by your deep knowledge,
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:13.720]  not just of common law or English law or our law, a cousin of it or a growth of it, an outgrowth.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:21.480]  But I know in Latin, but I can't remember the exact phrase, we know Kibono, who stands to gain,
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:27.880]  who benefits, but what's the Latin phrase or the English translation of it that the cover-up,
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:34.280]  the absconding, the suppression of evidence is generally the evidence of guilt?
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:44.280]  Oh, golly. Now, yes, I can't now instantly recall that one. It's one of these Latin tags
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:50.040]  they used to use until Tony Blair came along and said that Latin was too old-fashioned and nobody
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:54.280]  was to use it in the courts anymore. So you would hear it in Scotland where Latin is still quite
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:58.840]  frequently used in the courts, but not any longer in England. I can't remember the particular phrase
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:06.040]  you mean, but certainly it is very puzzling that Obama and his lawyers have been messing around
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:13.160]  with this in the way that they have. He could and should have come out with all the documentation
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:20.040]  much earlier on instead of really dangling the idea in front of people that maybe he wasn't
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:25.880]  all that he said that he was. And that was unfortunate. It makes people uneasy to think
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:30.520]  that Chief Executive might not, in fact, be valid to the Chief Executive because he was born
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:36.360]  somewhere else and that every law that he signed might be invalid. I mean, there have been judges
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:42.840]  speculating on this because so long has he taken to get round to just doing what in Britain would
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.360]  have been available anyway from Somerset House and providing his birth certificate.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:54.760]  And still, 99.9% of his records are sealed while other politicians aren't doing that.
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:59.880]  So why hide it if there isn't something there he doesn't want us to look at and many believe,
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.840]  and we've seen this in his own admissions partially, that his name was Barry Citerro.
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:09.960]  He was adopted in Indonesia. He did go to school there. We have the school form where he says that
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:15.640]  he was a Muslim. And so it, I even had a guest on yesterday before this happened saying, I think he
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:23.400]  was born in, from the evidence in the Hawaiian Islands, but there's something else there they're
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:28.760]  hiding. And clearly, why spend millions blocking all this if they're not hiding something?
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:35.000]  Well, it is very unsatisfactory, very undemocratic, and very stupid, obviously,
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.600]  nothing to hide. If there is something to hide, then my guess is that because of all the messing
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:45.720]  around, eventually, some of these lazy left-wing journalists will start digging and when they
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:50.440]  do, they'll start finding things. Well, remember, we were told with the climate people that it was
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:55.800]  all peer reviewed, 100% no mistakes, and that every time you get the documents and burrow in,
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:02.680]  it's complete fraud, complete lies, or photos by a film student of the Himalayas is now total
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:08.280]  scientific proof with 2,000 scientists that they're going to totally melt. And it turns out it's all
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:13.560]  a bunch of smoke and mirrors, total hollow flim flam. The point is they don't want us digging
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:19.160]  into anything they're doing because nine times out of 10, if we scratch the surface, we find out
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:24.520]  it's rotten beneath the surface. That's right, the maggots are crawling out as we speak. No,
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:31.560]  there's certainly, on the climate thing, it's all overbothered. I mean, nobody seriously believes
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:38.120]  we're going to get a 20-foot sea level rise that Al Gore was talking about after a century with hardly
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:44.840]  any. Nobody believes that we're going to get a massive temperature rise after 10 years with no
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:51.160]  temperature rise at all. All of it has been exaggerated, and the usual suspects are becoming
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:57.400]  hysterical. You now see on the green website, where did we go wrong? Why does nobody believe us?
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:02.680]  Answer, because what they've been saying isn't true. And eventually, you can fool some of the
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:07.240]  people some of the time, but you can't fool all the people all of the time. That is, they've blown
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:14.040]  it because they tried on the left to politicize the truth. The traffic light tendencies, I call
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:19.720]  them the greens, too yellow to admit they're really red. They tried to take over the subject of
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:25.000]  science itself and politicize it in the way that Marxism has tried to politicize everything else.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:31.240]  Well, that's how the controlled left, the staged left here in the US does it. They create watchdog
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:37.720]  groups that claim they're completely unpartisan and the absolute arbiters of fact as if they are
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:43.160]  Christ at the Sermon of the Mount or Moses at Mount Sinai, you know, the lawgiver. And then,
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.680]  when you get their corporate documents and internal documents like media matters a few
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:55.000]  months ago, Politico did, its wholly owned subsidiary of George Soros stating we are here to destroy
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:01.640]  the alternative media to infiltrate groups, cognitive dissidents, Cass Sunstein at the
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.360]  White House saying we're here to destroy freedom. We're here to shut down free press. They actually,
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:11.400]  I mean, these are seething authoritarians. And now you have all the major green leaders in Europe
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:18.520]  and the US coming out saying green fascism, their term is sexy. We're gonna bring tyranny. If you
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:25.160]  don't like it, we'll enforce it at the barrel of a gun. The truth is they are manifest frauds
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:34.600]  and they love to pose as if they are God. Well, the great thing now is that they've made the huge
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:41.000]  mistake of trying to politicize science. And the reason why that's a mistake is that science
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:46.760]  in the end is there to establish objectively speaking what is true and distinguish it from what
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:53.640]  is not true. And what they have been trying to say is that their particular weird point of view
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:44:00.120]  was the scientific truth when science increasingly openly is finding the courage to say it isn't.
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:08.840]  And this, Alex, this could be the end of the political left. I think they really have blown
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:15.000]  it on this one. It's becoming visible to everyone that this global warming thing is nonsense. I
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.160]  was at the University of St Andrews last week speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom independence
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:27.000]  party there. And I mentioned that all of Scotland's windmills, if they went on for 20 years as they
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:35.880]  are now, will forestall 0.00002 Celsius of global warming. That is all. So all these measures they
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:40.360]  have, they're not cost effective. It doesn't matter what, even if they were right about this,
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:46.920]  it isn't cost effective to do anything about it. Sure, reality encroaches on their fantasy. Sorry.
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:51.640]  That is what's happening. While I'm on this point of the United Kingdom independence party,
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:57.720]  I'm very grateful, Alex, that you're letting me do these broadcasts in these few weeks because
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:04.520]  here I am in Edinburgh and I came here and hired an apartment here so that I would have
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:10.120]  access to all the news media and the studios. I am, after all, the leader of the United Kingdom
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:16.600]  independence party in Scotland. The only party that opposes Alex Salmon's program, he's the
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:21.880]  current First Minister of Scotland, of covering the whole of the Highlands in windmills because
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:27.240]  he thinks he's going to save the planet. Of course, clearly it isn't, and it's just a bankrupt
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:35.720]  process. But can I get any of the news media to let me anywhere near a microphone or a television
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:43.800]  camera? Absolutely not. They are giving coverage to parties far smaller, with far fewer votes
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:50.200]  than UKIP, but they will not give us any coverage because we are the party that speak for the
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:55.400]  people. We are the party that speak for freedom against the establishment of the political class
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:46:01.240]  and the media increasingly see themselves as part of the political class and that their duty
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:06.920]  is not any longer to question the politicians in charge but to keep them there and to make sure
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:12.440]  that nobody from any of the smaller parties, and we are now the second largest party in Britain,
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:16.760]  but that counts as a small party as far as they're concerned, should be allowed anywhere near a
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:23.160]  microphone. The only way I can speak to the people of Scotland and be heard at the moment, Alex,
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:29.160]  is through your program. Unbelievable. We have a lot of listeners on the shortwave,
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:33.880]  on satellite, and the internet in Scotland, and it's more important than ever that they
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:38.840]  spread the word and let people know that this is suppressed information, that they send people
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:44.840]  the videos and audio of the interviews you've done here via YouTube out to everyone, and it will
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:50.360]  spread virally when you let people know this is being suppressed. That's like advertising a football
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:55.560]  game, and then when the other team shows up to get on the field, you don't let them on the field
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:01.560]  and then your referees declare you the winner, but it's because they are losing so much credibility
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:07.880]  that they're desperate to not give you equal or fair time or any time, and that takes us back to
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:14.120]  the fact that regardless of where Obama was really born, 62% of Americans don't think he was born here
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:21.320]  because they don't believe anything he says, and as the system has this credibility implosion,
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:27.800]  they're going to get more and more authoritarian. Now, you wanted to talk some before we get into
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:33.320]  some other issues about the royal wedding, and you were telling me off air, it's a positive thing
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:43.480]  because nationalism is anathema to the one-world government movement, and so clearly if this is
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:50.840]  a way to bring the people of the UK together, it can be seen as positive. What's your view overall
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:57.320]  on the royal wedding? Well, that is exactly the point. The United Kingdom Independence Party is the
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:06.840]  one party in Scotland that unashamedly believes in keeping the monarchy, keeping the non-political
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:15.080]  head of state separate from the political heads of government. That way, we have some national
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:22.440]  identity, we have a national focus, which we badly need now that five-sixths of our laws
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:28.520]  are made for us, whether we like it or not, by the unelected commissars, that's the official
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:34.520]  German name for the very revealing name, the Communist Commissars of the European Union.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:41.640]  They now make behind closed doors five-sixths of Scotland's laws, of England's laws, and of all the
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:49.160]  other 27 countries in the dismal empire of Brussels. This is sort of tyrannized by Clark,
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:56.760]  and we are the one party that says we believe in the monarchy. To us, a royal wedding is an
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:04.840]  expression of our national identity, and it's a day of celebration and fun, and of being proud
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:12.600]  that we are an independent and democratic nation, and who by our will have kept the monarchy there.
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.720]  After all, if we didn't want the monarchy, we could have voted it out of existence long ago,
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:26.360]  but we haven't done that. We have voted to keep it because we now need it as a defense against
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:34.280]  the increasing encroachments of alien powers and alien concepts, all of which are anti-democratic,
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:38.680]  even in our own news media, which is why I'm so delighted to be able to speak to my friends
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:43.240]  all over Scotland through you. Just to give you an example of the sort of things being happening,
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:50.520]  I had a press officer on the case for two weeks, ringing every day, every TV studio, every radio,
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:56.120]  every newspaper, saying, here we are, here's our message for today, and one of them, one of the
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:01.640]  biggest TV companies at Britain, STV, their political correspondent eventually came on the line,
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:07.240]  he said, look, we have mentioned the United Kingdom independence party once before the
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:13.640]  campaign began. We are not going to mention it at all for the rest of the campaign, whatever happens.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:22.200]  That's how entirely unfair it is, and so that's why I'm so grateful that I can now say
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:27.960]  to the people of Scotland, we are the one party that says no to all these windmills,
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:34.760]  no more new windmills. What about organizing protest out front some of the bigger stations
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:39.560]  and have the UK Independence Party people out there to point out to everybody this is happening?
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:46.360]  Well, on Sunday, for instance, they have the leaders debate where the leaders of the major parties
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:51.720]  in this election will be in a television studio being watched by the whole people of Scotland,
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:58.760]  run by the BBC, the one political leader who will not be there unless I can get crash it is me.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:26.760]  All right, we'll be right back Lord Monkton, stay there.
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:34.120]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in

[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:10.440]  Lord Christopher Monkton is our guest a little bit into the next hour.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:15.880]  We'll continue with your phone calls and get into dollar policy from the private Federal Reserve
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:20.600]  that the head of the Federal Reserve in Kansas City and Dallas is saying will cause hyperinflation.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:26.440]  Walmart heads saying that. McDonald's is saying that. I even heard Huckabee on the radio this
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:31.640]  morning, Governor Huckabee saying that this is basically by design to bankrupt us by the banking
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:38.280]  class. So amazing information. Lord Monkton, I want to get more into some of the geopolitical
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:43.800]  things that are happening and the exciting news because I mean I know you really say what you
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:50.280]  think that the communist collectivist posing as environmentalists are bleeding out and may
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:56.360]  be mortally wounded. How do we ensure that that happens politically and that there be a new
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:02.440]  renaissance and a reawakening of liberty, but getting back to the monarchy. Look, I understand
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:08.200]  that having the royal family and having the House of Lords and all that's part of England
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:13.560]  I understand it was the Lords that as I said earlier brought in the Magna Carta what is
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:20.360]  the precursor to our Constitution, Bell of Rights. I understand large sections of the
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:28.360]  gentry and the commoners and the elite in England actually supported the move in 1776,
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:33.320]  but that the King George III overwrote it with a speech to parliament. So I understand it's a very
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:39.720]  diverse issue and I see your point about sovereignty. I wouldn't have such a big problem with the
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:47.400]  Saxe-Coburg gophers known as the Wenzers if all the leadership I see supporting eugenics,
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:54.840]  one-child policies, global carbon taxes, constantly running around, pushing for the other,
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:59.960]  I shouldn't be able to take a shower but Prince Charles can have these trains and helicopters
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:05.560]  and jets. I mean, bottom line, I understand UK Independence Party has great policies on every
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:10.200]  issue and I understand you see it as a sovereignty issue to support the monarchy because it's one
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:18.680]  of the few vestiges that could be seen as English that's left versus the new monarchy of the unelected
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:23.800]  pointy-headed Herman von Roope and Schwarzenegger now wants to come over and be the head of it.
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:30.040]  I get it, I understand it, but as a hereditary lord who does stand up for liberty,
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:36.360]  I mean, I know you know the top folks at the House of Wenzers, do you ever talk to them about
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:43.720]  their socialistic activity? Well, yes, I mean, I did have a quiet word with Prince Charles the
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:50.040]  other day at his birthday party and said, look, this climate thing, you could go on talking
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:55.640]  about deforestation by all means. That's something where, you know, your voice needs to be heard,
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:00.520]  but get off the climate, I said. First of all, it's a political football, you shouldn't be intervening
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:05.800]  in politics, you're supposed to be above politics. But second, if I have to say, the science is
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:14.120]  collapsing and he looks very upset. He doesn't like to be told that this new religion that he's
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:20.920]  adopted is hollow underneath and there's no truth in it. He gets very upset because he is
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:27.640]  surrounded by people from, you know, what we would call the usual suspects. The Marxists left
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:32.600]  who are doing their best to capture the monarchy as they're trying to capture everything else in
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:38.680]  life as they've tried to capture science. But the reason why I think that despite all that,
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:44.440]  we've got to back the monarchy, is that when Prince Charles eventually becomes king,
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:53.080]  he will have to be silent about this nonsense or he will have to go. Because increasingly,
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:58:00.040]  it is realized that the monarchy only remains the monarchy by the will of the people. And if
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:08.040]  Prince Charles continues to take sides on political issues, then he will lose support
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:13.800]  for the institution of the monarchy very, very quickly. And his advisors, I know this, are
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:20.040]  already telling him that. And he is trying to balance what they're saying in one ear with
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:24.440]  what the Marxists are saying to him through the other ear about how if we really want to destroy
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:28.760]  capitalism and introduce the new communist world order, we have to go on plugging away at the
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:32.600]  climate because it's our best hope of bringing this about. That's them.
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:37.160]  Lord Monkton, this is amazing. Back in one minute, it's hard to interrupt you. Tell us more. But you're
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:40.200]  right in the news because of his politics. They're already talking about passing him over.

[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:56.040]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:56.040 --> 01:59:00.760]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:04.360]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:10.440]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:15.720]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:21.480]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal off-short cartel held
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:25.720]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:29.640]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches.
[01:59:29.640 --> 01:59:32.120]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:35.960]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.400]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:21.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:30.200]  You know, we need to get Lord Christopher Monkton back on because he is our red-o'-jerry
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:37.240]  peer to the crown Lord Monkton of Brentsley-Vicount. And he has such a wide breadth of knowledge
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:41.480]  because to understand what's happening in the world, to know history is to know the future.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:48.920]  But he was really dishing some amazing insider info about Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales,
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:57.560]  and his father, the consort to Elizabeth II, the Queen of England, the Duke of Edinburgh,
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:03.000]  about his differences of opinion with his son, Prince Charles.
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.360]  Please continue, Lord Monkton. This is intriguing stuff.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:12.120]  Yeah, let me give you an indication of how I know that they both have different views. Of course,
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:18.440]  Prince Charles's views are very well known. He has spoken out rather too often on a subject
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:22.520]  where, strictly speaking, as the heir to the throne, he should remain silent because it's a
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:30.040]  political subject. And gradually, his courtiers, I think, are beginning to win and quieten him
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:36.200]  down on this. He speaks out on it less often, at least in public than he used to. But interesting
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:43.720]  really, two years ago, the palace arranged for Professor Ian Plymer, who is the Professor of
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:47.480]  Mining Geology at the University of Adelaide, formerly of Melbourne, a very distinguished
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:51.960]  geologist who doesn't believe a word of this climate rubbish and has written a best-selling,
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:57.800]  hundred-thousand-selling book called Heaven and Earth about the climate. The Duke of Edinburgh
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:04.520]  invited him to give the annual Duke of Edinburgh lecture at Buckingham Palace to a distinguished
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:10.280]  invited audience in front of the Duke. And this is an enormous honour. You know, one person a year
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:16.200]  gives this lecture, Ian was approached, said yes, made the bookings, got the plate tickets,
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:23.800]  said to his wife, we're off to London for a few weeks in May, and then, suddenly, for no reason,
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:31.560]  he was uninvited. Never happened before. And he got a rather strange letter from somebody
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:35.880]  associated with the organisation of the lecture saying, well, I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:39.720]  it's now not going to be possible for you to come and give the Duke of Edinburgh lecture.
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:48.200]  And what we think must have happened is that Prince Charles, who is fanatical on this global
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:54.520]  Warwick subject, probably lent on his dad and said, but don't you dare have this person anywhere
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:59.080]  near the palace. The word will get out and everybody will think that we're no longer
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:04.520]  true believers in the new religion. So I suspect that that's what happened. But anyway,
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:10.280]  without any explanation, Ian was told, no, you can't come. And it's never happened before.
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:16.680]  And it's very, very unlike the palace ever to issue an invitation and then unissue it again.
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:20.920]  The only other case I can think of where they did this is that there's quite a nasty
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:29.240]  racialistic party here called the Brutish National Party, which stands for everyone who's black being
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:34.680]  sent back where they came from and treated very badly and second classes and they're nasty people.
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:41.880]  And their leader was invited to one of the garden parties that are held, thousands of people go
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:47.800]  every year in the summer at Buckingham Palace. And this called such a stir that eventually
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:53.160]  that invitation too was withdrawn. But it's very rare for that to happen. The palace normally is
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:59.880]  very careful not to invite somebody unless it means that person to come. And so here was this,
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:06.120]  obviously, a row between the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Charles about the climate, Duke of Edinburgh
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:11.400]  wanting simply to hear the other side of the case. And even that was so offensive to Prince
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:17.960]  Charles that it was stopped. And this is very unsatisfactory because of course it is necessary
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:24.040]  particularly for the future King of England to make sure that he keeps his mind open to both
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:29.880]  sides of the question, particularly on this climate thing. Because the debate is beginning to shift
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:37.480]  now away from the science because now basically everybody realizes that the rate at which the
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:41.320]  planet is warming is simply not matching the prediction that it hasn't warmed at all. All
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:45.560]  right Lord Monkton final segment we've got a break come back and finish up with that and then
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:50.120]  was that private what you told me or can you talk about the difference in views between the Duke
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:57.000]  of Edinburgh and the uh well his son we'll be right back on the other side stay with us.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:05.800]  Over the last year Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and
[02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:11.320]  disasters and unprecedented numbers. People have had to literally run for their lives. Folks this
[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:16.520]  is Steve Shank with E-Foods Direct. I'm not here to scare you but when disaster strikes you won't
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:21.640]  have time to think you must act automatically. What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:27.160]  fails in flight? No time to think just act automatically. When the alert is broadcast the
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:32.120]  alarm sounds or the knock comes on your door you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:38.680]  to do or what you need. You need a five-day extreme emergency kit with serious supplies and real food
[02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:45.000]  to secure to adults for five days. This powerful three hundred dollar extreme emergency kit is free
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  with an order of at least nine hundred and ninety five dollars from E-Foods Direct. Go to

[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:24.440]  Over the years the crazy part is he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse of GM
[02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:29.080]  Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner General Growth Properties. In fact
[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:34.520]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:39.080]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:43.720]  I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video online today. He explains
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:47.960]  everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:55.640]  video at www.EndofAmerica3.com that's End of America the number three dot com watch the free video

[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:31.640]  or antibacterials. Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes

[02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:31.880]  You know why the Sun never sat on the British Empire don't you listeners because God wouldn't
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:37.400]  trust an Englishman in the dark and of course scratching Englishmen find a pirate they say but
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:41.800]  you scratch anybody you're going to find a pirate that's the truth about civilization.
[02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:48.840]  There are great heights and also great lows we must bound down the tyrannical instincts that are
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:58.600]  out there in humankind with law with a republic instead we have the new global order of select
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:04.840]  bureaucratic interest and their financiers and they are rolling out a classical tyranny dressed up
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:11.320]  in perfumed like a pig with sweet statements about liberty and freedom but when you study the
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:18.360]  UN when you study the EU it is classical tyranny when you study the world treaty Lord Monkton you
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:22.920]  said last week when we were talking on air and that you were talking to one of the big national
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:26.840]  writers with the national post one of the big national papers in Canada and they were saying
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:30.440]  how do you know how dare you say there's a world government in this treaty and you said haven't
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:35.080]  you read it and he came back later and said it's 10 times worse than you say I mean if people will
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:42.440]  only go look at the evidence they will see what we're facing here well that is exactly right
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:46.440]  there's no doubt if you read these documents which and they're written deliberately very
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:53.240]  obscurely at great length with long words that you enter past master at this they call it transparent
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:58.280]  impenetrability all the documents are available but you you wouldn't understand them even if you
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:04.280]  keep yourself awake to read them they're very dull but it's in the dullness but all this nasty
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:10.040]  detail is hidden and yes just like the EU which has now succeeded in establishing effectively a
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:16.120]  dictatorial tyranny throughout Europe so much so as I've said they're now arresting people at three
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:21.080]  in the morning and taking them over and putting them in Hungarian jails and torturing them there
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:26.600]  by feeding them pork fat three times a day which has gone rancid without even charging them with
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:31.960]  a crime that's the kind of thing that now happens in the European Union and you know just the other
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:37.880]  day I was speaking as you know at a at a hustings here and I said Britain is now in fact a police
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:42.600]  state in the formal sense you can be arrested and locked up without trial how many of you
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:48.040]  fence I said I think that's an overstatement and about half the hands went up so then I told them
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:53.480]  the story of Jason McGoldrick who did have his door kicked in by our version of the KGB acting
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:58.280]  on behalf of the European commissars and this guy was hauled off without having done anything wrong
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:02.520]  without being charged with anything and spent four months in a Hungarian prison still hasn't
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:06.520]  been charged 18 months later still wondering whether he's going to be because they're still
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:13.960]  pretending to investigate his case this kind of outrage where without going in front of any proper
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:19.720]  court hearing without any evidence being produced you can be arbitrarily arrested and detained
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:25.720]  at will for as long as a foreign power wants that is something new in Britain previously if you
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:31.320]  were a British subject and you produce a British passport then any foreign powers very careful
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:36.840]  before it arrested you to make sure that it went through the due process notified your embassy
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:44.040]  gave you a proper charge she told you what you're charged with not anymore now Britain has given away
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:50.360]  the protection of its own citizens so that alien foreign powers who don't believe in democracy
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:55.240]  don't believe in habeas corpus don't believe in the right of an individual not to be locked up
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:01.480]  without trial a right guaranteed since magma Carter they don't believe any of that our governments
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:06.920]  have handed away our protection and when you were done breaking that down and when you were done
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:12.600]  breaking that down it went from 60 agreeing with you to all of them which shows the proof is in the
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:16.440]  evidence and if people will just look at it they will discover what's happening we did cover that
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:23.960]  in great detail uh last thursday lord mongton now looking at uh where we stand today uh finishing
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.760]  up with the whole royal issue that i want to get into uh thanks moving from the science to the
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:34.120]  economics of what the climate change pushers uh are now trying to put out there they've gone
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:39.000]  from global warming to climate change now any climate change uh is evidence that you we've
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:48.520]  got to pay them carbon uh indulgences uh basically uh show that um al gore can build his own palaces
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:55.320]  but but uh going back what is the view because i've studied the history a spectrum of history books
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:13:03.320]  what is the view 235 years ago versus today uh of what happened in the colonies or what
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:08.920]  Winston Churchill called uh our american cousins from your perspective uh because you always speak
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:16.360]  fondly of the 1776 ideals versus the out of control behavior uh of king george the third
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:22.920]  well you see it's not just the out of control behavior king george the third we now have thanks
[02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:29.320]  to the eu this model for what the un is trying to turn into a world dictatorship and the one
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:38.600]  bastion of freedom which was built by the founding fathers of your united states of america is your
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:45.720]  constitution there's opening words where it gets straight to the point and says all legislative
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:50.600]  power here in granted shall be vested in a congress of united states which shall consist of a senate
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:58.200]  and house of representatives period so the all power is in the hands of people but you now elect
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:04.280]  to exercise that power nobody can make laws for you unless you elected them to do it that's democracy
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:11.640]  and while that idea continues to exist in your continuing constitution while you in america
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:18.920]  continue to live by that idea then there is hope for us who now live under a stifling bureaucratic
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:26.840]  tyranny of clocks but one day we shall again be free as you are free so do not let your freedom go
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:32.680]  we need you to keep it so that we can get our freedom back but going back to the time reading
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:40.280]  the debates in parliament and leading statesmen uh they were supportive and said look what our
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:44.920]  fellow englishmen and the colonies are saying is what is in our magna carta and in the parliament
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:51.640]  act we've got to you know basically support them and that it was that same bureaucratic tyranny
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:57.640]  of the unelected imperial governors uh treating the colonies uh like they were a complete vassal
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:04.920]  state that triggered that and what we see today is a rerun of that uh by the eu i think that's
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:11.080]  that's a very nice parallel and certainly if you read the wonderful speeches of say edmund Burke
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:17.160]  in the parliament both before and after the american revolution beforehand he gave warning
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:22.680]  after warning after warning but if we didn't behave in a sensible way towards our colonies
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:28.360]  they would break free and these warnings were not heated by the establishment of the day because
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:34.040]  just like the establishment of today the establishment then did not care for the freedom
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:41.160]  of the people and that's the big problem that's why i'm having to broadcast via your kind offices
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:48.120]  into my own country of scotland because none of the news media here will allow the one party that
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:53.960]  speaks for freedom in this country to get on the air it will not allow us well you're winning elections
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:58.440]  in england uh you're winning them in the eu parliament you're winning them all over they're
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:04.360]  scared of you and and that brings me to my final question uh people can find out uh more at the
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:10.760]  uk independence party's website ukip.org or lord monkton's excellent site science and public
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:19.080]  policy dot org a great compendium of research on the fraud of the uh carbon uh taxing uh mafia
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:23.560]  science and public policy dot org links to it on info wars dot com in the three or four minutes
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:28.600]  we've got left lord monkton uh putting in caps on this you i was saying what's their latest
[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:35.320]  stratagem to seize control of all human activity and only allow their cronies that are given letter
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:41.480]  of mark the right to even operate in commerce and you said well you know more and more as they lose
[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:46.920]  credibility uh now things are moving from the science to the economics so what is the latest
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:54.680]  on the front lines dealing with this criminal mafia right what is now happening is that economists
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:17:02.280]  the world over from president vatslav Klaus of the Czech republic to Bjorn Lomborg to me in the
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:08.840]  united kingdom to Nigel Lawson the former finance minister of britain who also is very skeptical
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:15.720]  of all this all of us are now increasingly working together to try to demonstrate just how
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:23.160]  cost ineffective in economic terms it would be to spend money trying not to emit carbon dioxide
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:28.440]  all that does is you destroy your economy you it's a massive transfer of wealth from the port of the
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:33.720]  rich landowners in scotland are making a fortune out of these windmills you keep it the only party
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:41.160]  that would ban them but the point is now we have at last managed to narrow down on the key equations
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:49.000]  which say that if you spend money on trying to make global warming away by by taxing or controlling
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:55.640]  carbon dioxide that will be the least cost effective use of taxpayers money in human history
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:59.720]  and when you think of some of the waste of taxpayers money we've seen that's quite a statement
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:04.680]  but we're coming pretty close to be able to prove that and once we do and we get that in the scientific
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:09.960]  literature it's on its way already then that will be the end of this nonsense because nobody
[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:18.200]  but nobody will go on throwing dollar bills straight down the bog when there's not the slightest
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:24.360]  chance of that spending doing anything to change the climate whatsoever and so this new economic
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:29.480]  thrust which is happening all over the world now has really got the other side worried in
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:35.720]  Australia just a couple of weeks ago professor tim flannery who is one of the bedwetters the
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:40.520]  art bedwetters of Australia he's being paid a hundred and eighty thousand dollars a day to work
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:46.360]  three half days a week promoting the idea that global warming is terrible he was interviewed by
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:51.160]  andrew belt of the australian herald sun who's a very clever man and who had got in touch with me
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:57.640]  and said look can you just do the sums for me on how much global warming would go away if australia
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:03.320]  were to cut her carbon emissions by ten percent in ten years as the government and flannery want
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:10.200]  because i'm going to ask flannery about it so i said yes it's one twenty thousandth of a celsius
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:16.280]  degree of warming would go away in ten years if you spent all these trillions in australia and he
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:21.240]  said is it really as little as that i said yes and i did the sum for him so he asked flannery to do
[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:27.320]  the sum for him and flannery flanneled he couldn't do the sum he wouldn't admit how little global
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:33.400]  warming would be forestalled and eventually andrew bolt cornered him and he said right come on the
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:38.280]  fact is nothing we do now is going to make any difference is it and flannery cracked he said
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:42.920]  well no it isn't actually because whatever we do the temperature will not drop for a thousand years
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:46.760]  all right lord montan asked from an official source that is an admission of what we've been
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:51.880]  saying for years wow it's all over bother shouting now even the people who are paid to

[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:28.120]  blasted me and basically said that i believe in blood drinking reptoid lizards which i don't
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:38.600]  and never get into because i don't like the monarchy and to be clear it's a diverse group
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:44.440]  some of them hereditary some of them rewarded with lordships you know the whole nine yards
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:49.640]  whatever and i might have a different view of the monarchy if it wasn't constantly you know
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:56.600]  calling for us to cut our standard of living and living off british taxpayers and then
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:03.560]  living lavish lifestyles i don't like it and they go on to make fun of me and attack us here
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:09.080]  for the video i put out that's gone completely totally viral and it just went up on info wars
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:13.960]  dot com the link to it if you want to find it the royal wedding and the new world order
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:19.800]  order and i won't have time to go through this entire article but they really they really come
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:24.760]  after me uh in this story it's pretty well written little hit piece to churned out
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:31.080]  by tim stanley maybe we'll get tim stanley on but i'm going to have steve watson who
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:37.400]  has a degree in political science but also uh studied the royals and that was a sub study
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:43.800]  i'm gonna get steve watson or paul watson they're over in england uh to uh write a rebuff to this
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:52.520]  because um it's certainly getting attention over there which was my plan uh uh side issue
[02:25:52.520 --> 02:25:57.880]  we've got huge dollar devaluation accelerating the media's gone from denying that dollar devaluation
[02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:03.000]  was happening to admitting it and admitting that's the main driver between uh the commodities going
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.880]  up that's why people are paying over four bucks a gallon now and i was tuning through the dial
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:17.800]  the day fox tv listing on xm cnn local radio national in between the birth certificate stuff
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:24.360]  and obama's speech which shows how weak he is having to respond to it all they were talking about
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:31.400]  was yeah oil is going to go to seven dollars a gallon for refined gasoline by next year so it
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:35.320]  just turns out plus i even know the source uh lindsay william some people may not like his
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:40.600]  delivery he's not making any of it up i know the sources one of them we've revealed the others the
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:49.000]  former big three ceo and it's all true okay and the proofs in the putting um ted anerson's been
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.960]  holding for 15 minutes i took montan over i demanded ted come on because i wanted him to
[02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:59.880]  mention a few of the golden silver items uh in the news today golden silver both up even though
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:04.920]  the banksters have a short position on it and have been trying to drive it down they're failing
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:09.000]  ted uh one of these new federal reserve announcements mean where's golden silver right now and
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.960]  what's today's special offer for radio listeners only well here's what it is i mean first of all
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:19.400]  ben Bernadke gave a speech this morning saying that uh on june 30th the federal reserve system
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:24.920]  will stop buying us government securities that is the biggest bunch of hogwash that i ever heard
[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:29.560]  because what's going to happen then they own almost three quarters of all the securities out there
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:35.320]  and they're going to stop buying the the because he's not going to raise interest rates and uh if
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:39.960]  you don't raise interest rates nobody's going to buy him well that's right and the telltale sign is
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:44.760]  what is gold doing and how is it reacting to it gold is hitting a high today that it's never seen
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:53.080]  before 1500 and 24 dollars and 90 cents an ounce it's up 12 dollars and 60 cents silver's back up to
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:28:00.520]  47 18 and the raging bull market lost its wind yesterday and didn't like take very long for
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:05.640]  it to get the wind back into sales yeah i've told listeners i keep expecting a pullback for a while
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:11.160]  before it starts the march that's not happening that's pretty scary ted it is scary but it's a it's
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:16.920]  it's the truth being told as to what's really going on economically you know ben Bernadke
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:22.680]  he doesn't have a choice anymore if he stops buying the u.s. government bonds the interest
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:27.480]  rates are going to skyrocket the united states can't afford the yeah they're going to continue
[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:33.080]  qe2 they're just going to do it quietly uh you're right and even bloomberg was admitting that so
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:37.320]  we're seeing new levels of lying we're almost out of time ted but we have an expert coming
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:41.480]  on to break more of this down but you're an expert 30 plus years studying it you've certainly called

[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:16.200]  on the radio you've heard my voice uh they've been saying now for really a year that there was
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:20.200]  going to be a dollar default about four months ago they started saying that they believed it would
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:24.600]  happen by the end of this year or early next year and a lot of people said man that's a bold
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:29.960]  prediction well now all you hear about is default or technical default with the federal reserve
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:34.520]  monetizing over 70 of the debt you have the federal reserve announcements today that they
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:39.640]  will end qe2 but uh how are they going to do that if nobody else is going to buy it if they're not
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:45.480]  raising interest rates he really stuck his neck out there uh in the view of some for me it was
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:51.960]  common sense by coming out with the end of america uh information uh but they're also

[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:24.520]  need to listen baron's called his work a dire prophecy with his accuracy calling so many companies
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:29.960]  uh that went under long before anybody else was predicting it and he's made the point here on
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:35.880]  this show previously that was all child's play uh compared to the predictions that he's now making
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:42.760]  and going back to the fall of last year when he started really sounding the alarm and and calling
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:48.440]  it uh it's now happening imf bombshell age of america nears end market watch the new

[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:38.040]  yeah halex thanks for having me back you know one of the first things i said to you we met
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:43.960]  four months ago on the phone when you first had me on the show was the question in my mind
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:48.920]  isn't when this will happen the question in my mind is when will you realize it is happening
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:52.520]  and i asked you i went to the litany of things you know how high is gas going to have to go how
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:57.240]  high will silver have to go how many banks are going to have to fail you know how many uh the
[02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:02.360]  moody's downgrades are we going to have to see before it'll finally occur to you that man we
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:09.080]  can't repay these debts and there are serious consequences to that fact so you know i think
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:12.680]  that you're you know that was that was four or five months ago that was before the riots in
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:17.960]  wisconsin that was uh before the the the drama in the middle east has been caused by the inflation
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:22.760]  that we're producing so so many of the things we have seen in just four months come straight out
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:28.360]  of my report as you know because you've seen it but i think today for the first time ever when
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:34.200]  folks who view my my work they're not saying oh this could never happen now they're saying man
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:38.040]  this is happening right now what should i do and the answers of course are you know and the
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:44.680]  research that we produce itself to our subscribers starting with starting with you cannot believe
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:49.960]  anything the government tells you about the state of our financial affairs they are they are in
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:57.560]  complete denial neither a republican nor democrat has put forth a balanced budget ever in the last
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:03.720]  20 oh yeah paul ryan's paul ryan's program only rearranges deck chairs more of them than obama's
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:09.480]  program 38 billion in cuts what they've agreed to uh five trillion over a decade i mean if you
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:14.920]  don't get rid of the fractional reserve banking system if we don't ride off uh the derivatives
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:19.640]  everything else is window dressing is it not it's all that's that's the point that's the main point
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:24.360]  i'm making in that sooner or later our creditors are going to get fed up with this we don't know
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:29.560]  the fact is we don't know whether our creditors are fed up with it or not already there are plenty
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:34.680]  of indications that they are but as long as the fed is printing all the money necessary to buy all
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:40.840]  the new bonds we haven't seen the market impact of this all that stops with the end of qe2 and that
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:46.440]  will be the gigantic litmus test and i can tell you already exactly what will happen okay interest
[02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:51.400]  rates are going to spike the stock market is going to fall unemployment is going to rise silver and
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:56.840]  gold are going to continue to go up and the fed will have to announce a qe3 because there is no
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:02.120]  other way to finance our debts and believe me if you think silver has gone up a lot wait until
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:07.720]  qe3 is announced silver will absolutely soar it will at least double from its current price today
[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:12.920]  and you know i told you four months ago i said hey hey alex how much silver do you own and you
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:18.600]  said well you know who buy silver well you know it's gone up 50 since then it's going to go higher
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:23.560]  because the fact is we can't repay our debts to anything but newly printed now you've been calling
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:29.000]  silver for years and i had dr paul craig roberts former head of the treasury on a few days ago and
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:35.800]  he said there he said when they get rid of qe2 it may create such a depression in the economy
[02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:41.000]  that for a short term it may make gold and silver go down but then the inflation will only pick up
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.800]  again and then it'll go back up but many of the other economists i talked to are saying what you're
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:52.200]  saying that basically it's going to be unabated uh do you disagree with what he was saying i i will
[02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:57.400]  tell you this if you look at what happened after the end of qe1 gold did not fall all the other
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:02.840]  commodities did and you're going to see exactly the same thing this time gold and silver's rise
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:08.840]  may slow but it will not decline and the reason why is because if you want to know the real credit
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:13.720]  rating in the united states not in potato attention the moody's and s&p they're liars and everyone
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:18.760]  should know that by now you want to know the real credit rating in the united states pull up a chart
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:24.200]  of the bond market versus precious metals and you'll see that that gap between the value of our
[02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:29.160]  government's bonds and the value of precious metals continues to get wider every month month in and
[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:34.920]  month out since the bailouts of 2008 and why is that happening because the real credit rating of
[02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:39.400]  the united states is being expressed in the soaring price of gold and the falling price of our bonds
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:45.560]  and they're propping up the bond market but they cannot control the price of gold and silver now
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:50.120]  porter i want to continue breaking down what's currently happening how you see this unfolding
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:56.120]  how long after june and the qe2 ending a lot of experts we talk to think they're going to quietly
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:01.400]  continue some qe2 just not at the same level but that will still have the same inflationary
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:07.240]  effect but every time i've had you on you really don't even promote the newsletters you have a wide
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:14.840]  body of specific analysis general analysis your overall newsletter tell the listeners if they visit
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:20.040]  end of america video dot com how they can go there and then check out the different subscriptions
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:25.240]  that are offered because this is valuable information i've researched your info and i have found
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:31.240]  none better and i found no one who's bold enough to have the courage that you've had thank you very
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:36.920]  much alexa i uh i definitely speak my mind and uh you know i'm i'm certainly i'm bound to be wrong
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:41.240]  from time to time but at least my subscribers can always count on me tell them what i believe why
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:45.960]  i believe it and i tell you what you know how rare that is in today's today's environment where
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:51.080]  everybody has an agenda you know not me i only get paid by my subscribers and i offer a money
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:54.440]  back guarantee and all my products so if you're ever not happy no problem we'll just send your
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:59.640]  money back but the best the best thing to do is please go watch the video alexa is giving you
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:04.200]  the website address check out my newsletter which is called standsbury's investment advisory
[02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:08.440]  if i can make you some money great renew your newsletter if not i'll send you your money back
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:15.800]  no no question that that's how i do business and it's important to know and be able to understand
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:21.800]  what's happening uh now now discuss this announcement by vernacchi today and their press release it's
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:28.120]  up on info wars dot com but what does that really signify what will that monetarily mean and then
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:33.480]  we see the financial times of london headline two days ago chinese signal they may cut their
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:37.800]  purchases that they've already cut the last two years they've already trimmed they may
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:44.120]  butcher it by two thirds that right there technically for in my research would signal
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:50.760]  the point of no return for the greenback well you know the key thing as i have explained to you
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:56.760]  many times and as in as in my online uh um uh my online production that i want people to go look at
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:02.200]  the key for americans is whether or not the u.s dollar can remain what's called the world's reserve
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:08.760]  currency and that's a fancy word but all it means is well banks around the world continue to stockpile
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:14.840]  dollars so that trade can be so that trade between countries can be netted out so if you're if you're
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:20.600]  brazil and you want to buy some uh some german cars are you going to pay and and euros are you
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:26.280]  going to pay in dollars and today people pay in dollars and that has that creates a huge need for
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:31.080]  dollars around the world and that's why china ends up with dollars because china has trade
[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:37.560]  surpluses so now for the first time ever many countries led by china are negotiating bilateral
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:43.400]  trade agreements where they are agreeing to accept uh other foreign currencies like russia and china
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:48.920]  now when they trade they do not use dollars and those kinds of agreements are going to grow in scope
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:53.640]  i also believe in this speculation but what i believe alex i believe very shortly you will
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:57.560]  see the chinese announced that they're going to begin backing their currency that you want
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:02.600]  at some combination of gold and silver and overnight that will make it the most attractive
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:07.880]  currency in the world to do business with well that's what the news is saying profound implications
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:13.160]  for americans well the news is now again just a month ago none of this was in the news now suddenly
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:17.640]  i listened to bloomberg it sounds like porter standsbury now i listen to cnn it sounds like
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:22.040]  porter standsbury so when you say don't believe the government's numbers we know those are cooked
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:27.320]  but the mainline media has lost so much credibility that i surfed through the channels on xm the day
[02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:33.240]  of of tv stations and every show was talking every financial show saying well you think four
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:39.080]  dollars a gallon's a lot try seven by the end of next year and they were admitting not because of
[02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:44.440]  opec not because of speculators but because of dollar devaluation what's going to happen to a
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:50.920]  faltering economy that can't handle four dollars a gallon when the dollar gets devalued more and
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:57.160]  more and as it gets unpegged from oil how high do you think it will go and how devastating will
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:03.560]  this be you know there's no telling how i could go there really is no telling what we might lose
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:10.120]  if if suddenly there is a dollar crash and let me tell you why this is so scary alex and i you
[02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:14.360]  know i i've been saying this for months and months and months and i'm not trying to scare people i just
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:20.920]  want you to know what the reality is what the risks are by by by printing money to repay our debts
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:26.200]  we are kicking our creditors in the shins and they are tired of it so they are looking for an
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:31.000]  alternative and that's why central banks are buying gold again from around the world but the big
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:36.600]  risk is there are so many dollars that have been stockpiled overseas that if the world moves away
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:40.520]  from trading in dollars all those dollars are going to or they're going to they're going to be
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:46.360]  cashed in and they're going to be cashed in and in the form of of a collapse on our bond market
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:50.600]  and a collapse in the purchasing power of our dollar because if everybody moves to sell the
[02:45:50.600 --> 02:45:55.880]  dollar the value of the dollar is going to collapse and we are very very close to that point
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:04.200]  porter i heard mike huck would be today on his little paul harvey type barblet he does
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:09.640]  and i normally don't agree with some of what he has to say but he came out and said why is geithner
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:15.880]  telling us that we have a strong dollar and a strong dollar policy when the dollar is weakening
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:21.880]  to all-time historic lows uh in modern history and when the policies are what are weakening the
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:27.400]  dollar a monetization of debt that he went on to explain it in kind of little league fashion for
[02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:32.280]  his listeners uh but he was actually telling the truth i guess a lot of the middle class a leader
[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:36.520]  figuring out an upper middle class that that that this is going to hurt everybody you know
[02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:42.280]  so many people went along with globalism and and and the central bank now they're figuring out just
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:47.000]  how devastating these policies are going to be and then he went on and said the evidence shows
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:51.960]  they want to wreck the dollar they want to damage it they want to get rid of it and i know you focus
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:57.320]  on what's going to happen how do you protect yourself because you don't you know believe
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:01.960]  overall in the wisdom of the general public from what you've seen and so you're just saying folks
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:07.080]  protect yourselves individually and i think on one front we should do that but also continue to try to
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:11.640]  fight these people on the other and i know that's your view as well i want to put words in your
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:17.560]  mouth but you can correct me but clearly they know what they're doing clearly this is the policy
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:23.240]  and soros and others are saying they want to force us onto this new global basket that's partially
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:30.680]  gold and silver backed which they are uh uh you flush in to basically use the crisis they've created
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:36.840]  to consolidate wealth and control what's your view on overall statement well i i certainly wouldn't
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:43.640]  disagree with you that it is in the best interest of some people for the dollar to lose value and
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:49.640]  uh i i i think that um to the extent that they encourage these policies that's absolutely
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:55.560]  truth but i see it more as simply uh natural political power having a paper dollar allows
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:48:01.560]  politicians to promise benefits without having to deliver the taxes to finance them so i see this
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:06.520]  is more of a natural evolution it happens at every democracy it's happened for as long as we have
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:11.960]  recorded history there has never been a paper currency standard that survived for very long
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:16.040]  and never in history before has there been a global paper standard which is what we have now
[02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:21.320]  it's lasted 40 years since 1971 and my in my opinion the collapse of the paper dollar is
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:26.600]  absolutely inevitable regardless of who benefits and i think that if we it does collapse and we
[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:32.200]  go to a uh my precious metals back standard which is by the way well what we had constitutionally
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:38.200]  in this country originally and what we had for 200 years it would benefit the common man the most
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:42.920]  because it would it would make it impossible for the politicians to have the power of an
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:47.880]  unlimited checkbook and that is the greatest risk to to real liberty in our country
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:55.480]  well i i couldn't say it any better in fact uh i mean i can't break it down as
[02:48:55.480 --> 02:49:02.360]  succinctly as you do bottom line porter standsbury you are the only major analyst out there
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:09.640]  who called bair Stearns who called gm who called fanny may freddy mac you know you were the first
[02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:15.240]  and that was what was so frightening whenever i saw your analysis five months ago when your
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:20.840]  video first came out we contacted you about coming on uh because i i watched your video i read your
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:27.160]  newsletter i concur with it and but you had the courage to come out and tell the truth uh now i
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:34.120]  think it's time to just focus on two fronts how do we politically try to reverse this a but b
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:40.680]  hope for the best prepare for the worst how do we individually protect ourselves well okay the
[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:45.800]  answer the first question is as you probably know i'm certainly not a political analyst
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:50.920]  you know the politics of this country and all the lobbying and everything that goes on i really
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:55.960]  truly do not understand except for i see how corrupted is and i want to stay away from it but
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:49:59.720]  if you wanted to solve our problems and i have no doubt that our politicians could care less
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:03.960]  about solving our problems all they want is more power but if you wanted to solve our problems
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:08.200]  you need three things okay number one you got to have sound money that means gold and silver
[02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:12.440]  back currency number two you got to have a balanced budget amendment why because it's morally
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:17.320]  reprehensible to pass on our debts to our children our grandchildren it's and it's just common sense
[02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:22.920]  you can't go on forever borrowing money everyone should know that and uh the the um the number
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:27.240]  three thing i believe we need and i think this is probably going to be unpopular by uh some of
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:32.520]  your listeners but i believe we got to have it and i want to explain why we have to have a flat tax
[02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:37.080]  i don't care if it's a flat sales tax i don't care if it's a flat income tax we have to have a
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:42.600]  provision that will prevent the progressive nature of the income because we spend 400 plus
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:48.120]  billion just on the cpas a year i agree with the flat tax the problem is they're going to give us a
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:53.160]  flat tax and keep the income tax you watch i i i agree with that and i understand that i'm not
[02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:58.200]  advocating that but here's but the fact is that progressive income taxes have allowed politicians
[02:50:58.200 --> 02:51:01.960]  to save for years and years and years and years i can give you benefits that you won't have to pay
[02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:07.160]  for because we will make the rich pay folks it's a lie if you took a hundred percent of the income of
[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:10.600]  everyone in this country here it's more than a quarter of a million dollars a year if you took
[02:51:10.600 --> 02:51:16.760]  all of it all of their income we would still have a deficit it's people vote in a different way when
[02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:21.400]  they don't have to pay the bill and that's why every american should pay the same rate of tax
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:26.040]  it's not because the rich don't well aren't going to pay more they're still going to pay a lot more
[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:30.680]  but the fact is is you're going to vote differently when you realize that you will have to pay the
[02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:36.200]  bill there is no Santa Claus there's there is no way to get something for nothing paper money doesn't
[02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:41.560]  work it leads to inflation eventually it leads to default and collapse america you got to grow up
[02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:46.200]  i've heard i've heard from some subscribers raging about how any cut to social security of
[02:51:46.200 --> 02:51:51.000]  medicare should be off the table look if we don't cut medicare social security benefits our entire
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:55.880]  country will be bankrupt in 10 years that's not an exaggeration that's a fact so people who claim
[02:51:55.880 --> 02:52:00.920]  they are owed something by our government are the same kind of people who invested in bernie madeoff
[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:05.480]  bernie madeoff might owe them money that might be absolutely the truth but it's irrelevant because
[02:52:05.480 --> 02:52:10.360]  bernie madeoff was a lie and a con and the same thing is true but the benefits you've been promised
[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:19.880]  by our government they cannot be delivered porter um now let's shift gears because i skipped this
[02:52:19.880 --> 02:52:25.480]  network break to continue this information so important continue with now solutions how we
[02:52:25.480 --> 02:52:29.640]  individually protect ourselves and i understand it's in the newsletter folks can find that the
[02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:34.760]  free video at end of america video dot com people need this information end of america video
[02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:39.560]  dot com there's so much info on that hour-long video but but i mean specifically uh and i
[02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:45.560]  understand it varies individual to individual absolutely but but but but basics sir basics
[02:52:45.560 --> 02:52:51.080]  three main ideas number one put yourself on a gold standard and by that i mean you know for
[02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:55.640]  your for your liquid savings take your money out of the bank put it in gold and silver bullion
[02:52:56.440 --> 02:53:03.400]  number two if you are a person of means invest in real estate overseas get money out of the us
[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:08.120]  and get it out of the us in a way that is not tracked by the us government so you do not have to
[02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:13.080]  report foreign holdings of real estate you do have to report foreign holdings of almost every other
[02:53:13.080 --> 02:53:17.560]  type so buy foreign real estate if you want to get a million bucks outside the us why would you
[02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:22.360]  want to get it outside the us because believe me the only way to pay these bills and after the default
[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:26.920]  happens you're going to see a lot new rules about moving money around the government is going to try
[02:53:27.560 --> 02:53:32.840]  some massive wealth tax where they're going to require you to pay some percentage of your network
[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:39.240]  send it to washington dc that's the only possible way after we default to to regain stability in
[02:53:39.240 --> 02:53:42.440]  our country and they're going to try to take it out of the highs of wealthy people that's the only
[02:53:42.440 --> 02:53:49.000]  way to do it so um gold and silver for yourself uh foreign real estate if you're um if you're wealthy
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:55.400]  and uh as a as a as a as a third thing that my newsletter really specializes in is figure out
[02:53:55.400 --> 02:54:00.680]  how to use this crisis to make some extra money for yourself so sure we've we've done well speculating
[02:54:00.680 --> 02:54:05.640]  in silver but as you know in the past we've also done very well by shorting select stocks that are
[02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:10.680]  very exposed to higher interest rates very exposed to currency fluctuations and we're going to continue
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:13.640]  to do the same thing for readers going forward while i was reading when you were writing four or
[02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:20.040]  five years ago you were predicting all of this because of the clear move towards fiscal irresponsibility
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:24.760]  monetization of debt uh they weren't slowing down they were accelerating you talked about
[02:54:24.760 --> 02:54:31.880]  food production raw materials rare earth minerals farmland now look at the speculators they figured
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:38.040]  it out late they're rushing in those prices are going up across the board they'll probably still
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:43.400]  go up more but what a what an even better investment if they to listen to you four years ago or if
[02:54:43.400 --> 02:54:49.160]  folks would have listened to us 11 years ago when silver was five dollars and i should get into it
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:55.880]  when gold was 260 and i said get into it and uh but i also see a reverse psychology porter
[02:54:55.880 --> 02:55:01.080]  where some people and i've got some uh extended relatives that i see a few times a year and and
[02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:06.440]  they'll make jokes that i told them buy gold at 300 they'll make jokes and i'll say well i still
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:11.240]  advise you to buy gold and silver and they go oh you advise and they'll start laughing at me and i'm
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:20.280]  like what's funny about gold up 450 silver up 750 plus i mean how in america with some people
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:26.520]  is it evil to be right evil to be accurate you know more than the mainstream media because
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:32.120]  they're being you know inaccurate on purpose is it that they don't like the fact that they were wrong
[02:55:32.120 --> 02:55:38.280]  and so they still want to play a mental game with themselves that you're wrong uh you know it's one
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:45.160]  of the craziest things i have seen in my career uh in the fall of 2008 my firm was the only research
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:50.360]  firm in america that had been that had predicted almost everything that happened almost exactly
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:55.400]  exactly as it did you know we predicted that bankruptcy of general motors of leemen of bear
[02:55:55.400 --> 02:56:01.480]  the failure of merrill i said in june of 2008 that fanny and freddy would go to zero and that's
[02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:08.600]  exactly what happened and yet at that in november of 2008 we had a record number of refund demands
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:12.920]  because people hadn't listened to us they hadn't taken our advice and they were mad at us because
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:17.080]  of it and so they wanted their subscription money back it's hard to believe but it's exactly what
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:21.880]  happened and and not only that but i had i had hundreds of letters from people telling me that
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:27.240]  because i was warning about the bankruptcy of general motors i was responsible for it there's
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:32.840]  this there's some idea in our country that if you write about something that's going to happen
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:40.360]  you're promoting it oh i get it every day newspapers in the last week have said that that that that i
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:48.280]  am causing pessimism porn that that that that i and others are responsible it's the federal reserve
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:54.120]  ladies and gentlemen it's the tens of trillions but no it's porter standsbury's fault it's jerald
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:57:01.160]  salente's fault it's alex jones's fault it's it's it's ron poll's fault no it is not our fault
[02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:06.280]  we warned you about the pit out in the field we didn't make you go out there and fall into it
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:10.680]  that's right that's right you know uh alex if i can just give you one one quick fact

[02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:19.000]  sure i have this right when i'm about to say sounds pretty extreme do i really have the facts to
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:27.480]  back this up there is now six hundred and eighty one thousand dollars in debt per us family that's
[02:57:27.480 --> 02:57:32.120]  total debt in our country six hundred and eighty one thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:39.480]  to be precise debt per us family can you have any families do you know that can finance six hundred
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:45.960]  and eighty one thousand dollars in debt maybe two percent it's in what we're facing as a nation
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:51.240]  is completely impossible you cannot make the math work and this is exactly what the bankers want

[03:00:15.400 --> 03:00:21.720]  wars right now we've been trying to beat the servers up miss america sexually molested by tfj
[03:00:22.360 --> 03:00:26.920]  got to continue the fight against that slave training that's going on she said they really
[03:00:26.920 --> 03:00:33.080]  grabbed her her private parts hard uh just unbelievable that's happening uh you know
[03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:38.040]  porter stands burry the system is setting up this police state knowingly ahead of the financial
[03:00:38.040 --> 03:00:45.400]  collapse and we've now gotten army documents that told us what we already knew that for a decade
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:51.960]  they've they've known that this derivatives connected glass deagle connected uh collapse was
[03:00:51.960 --> 03:00:57.400]  coming so they've cold-bloodedly set this up to to destroy the middle class give themselves more
[03:00:57.400 --> 03:01:02.760]  power and then they'll pose as the saviors and i know we go back to the political issue uh and
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:07.880]  and then you're like look all i'm saying is i know i can help people try to protect themselves
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:14.600]  uh but the two do go together i mean it's so horrible to see this road we're going down and
[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:19.320]  are you encouraged though or do you agree that we've seen a massive shift in media to where more
[03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:25.400]  and more they're having to admit that the streets are dire that's a great question alex i think that
[03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:31.400]  the numbers are so big now that even you know sort of the most naive newspaper journalist who
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:37.320]  doesn't know anything about finance is having a hard time you know coming up with a way to explain
[03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:42.440]  that you see what i'm saying i mean can you remember there was a time when a trillion dollar annual
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:48.200]  deficit was a crisis you know in 2008 congress almost didn't pass the financial bailout because
[03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:51.720]  it was going to be a trillion dollar deficit and everyone was terrified what that would mean for
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:56.280]  the dollar and now trillion dollar deficits are just no no no big deal we've had what we've had
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:01:59.880]  a trillion dollar deficit for three years in a row we're going to have a trillion dollar deficit
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:05.800]  for at least the next three years no one cares anymore that it's almost like the entire the entire
[03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:10.760]  monetary system in america is spinning out of control and that's exactly what's happening so i
[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:15.240]  think it's just that the facts are so bad the numbers are so bad that the lies aren't going
[03:02:15.240 --> 03:02:19.880]  to cover it anymore so they're kind of back to the corner of having to say hey you know what maybe
[03:02:19.880 --> 03:02:26.040]  this isn't sustainable but then they push austerity on the welfare moms and unions
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:31.880]  and the poor some of it who can't survive without it and i look at all the numbers
[03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:37.400]  you could get rid of of their entitlements and it's not going to fix it this thing is so huge
[03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:41.560]  what do we do just just tell the big central banks look we're not going to pay for your
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:46.200]  derivatives i mean is that the start of it uh... you know i definitely think that bailing out
[03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:51.160]  the banks was an enormous enormous disgraceful decision that was made i agree completely with
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:56.760]  you on that on that issue and what i'm saying is look why can't somebody isn't the president supposed
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:01.800]  to be honest with the american people all right isn't the republican party supposed to be the party
[03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:06.920]  of fiscal responsibility where is the leader in america who will stand up and tell the american
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:12.680]  people the truth we are broke alex if we continue to spend this way prices are going to just continue
[03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:17.080]  to go up that doesn't help anybody you know you think oh yeah we got to keep giving them money
[03:03:17.080 --> 03:03:21.000]  to the welfare moms and all that stuff and hey that is probably a social obligation we should
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:26.520]  live up to but we have to pay for it we can't just print it that's not going to help no no i hear
[03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:32.840]  you but but then if some of the welfare moms we've seen it in in cases like la i mean if they
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:36.920]  don't get those checks for a couple weeks cities are going to burn oh and that was one of my that's
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:41.720]  my biggest warning to people they're 45 million people on food stamps alex if we don't get the
[03:03:41.720 --> 03:03:45.320]  corn crop in the ground because the weather's so bad right now in the midwest they can't get it in
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:49.800]  the ground what the heck is going to happen you know i mean and even within even just regular
[03:03:49.800 --> 03:03:55.160]  inflation food prices are probably doubled in the last year so what's going to happen or you can't
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:04:00.920]  print money to pay for food stamps and printing money causes the food prices to go up and exactly
[03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:06.360]  with inflation they they can't increase the size of the checks they've frozen the cola on
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:11.400]  social security things that people paid into that pretty soon the welfare check or the social
[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:15.960]  security check or the food stamps aren't going to be able to get you the food you need that's right
[03:04:15.960 --> 03:04:19.960]  you know what i'm going to sell my gold and my silver alex i'm going to sell my gold and my silver
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:24.760]  when someone of an important position in the government stands up and tells the american
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:29.800]  people the truth that we have to cut the budget by an enormous percentage and that we have to
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:35.800]  therefore everything is on the table the military social security medicare social programs department
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:40.040]  of education everything has to be absolutely no way to make there is no way to make these numbers
[03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:46.440]  work without real real cuts absolutely porter standsbury end of america video dot com end of
