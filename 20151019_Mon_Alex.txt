[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:28.820]  this Monday is another total and complete information overload there is so much
[00:28.820 --> 00:34.200]  important news but I just want to harken back to Friday's top story again or
[00:34.200 --> 00:39.260]  Sunday's top story when I was on 4 to 6 p.m. last night Hillary Clinton
[00:39.260 --> 00:43.760]  nationwide gunband repeal of Second Amendment worth considering close
[00:43.760 --> 00:46.040]  quote
[00:49.040 --> 00:52.080]  and they're now announcing they've already shut down over a thousand
[00:52.080 --> 00:57.040]  power plants they're going to double that in Obama's last year what he did in
[00:57.040 --> 01:02.440]  2007 starting next year they want to double that before he leaves that'll be
[01:02.440 --> 01:07.520]  2000 plus power plants shut down and I know I just mentioned that constantly
[01:07.520 --> 01:12.400]  but that is such a devastating military attack on this country to bankrupt this
[01:12.400 --> 01:18.520]  nation I just cannot get over how much they hate us how bad they are most of
[01:18.520 --> 01:22.880]  it in the Midwest and the South they are screwing over the bitter clingers
[01:22.880 --> 01:28.360]  that's you they absolutely hate our guts
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.320]  all building a new power plant every two weeks in Mexico and three a week in
[01:33.320 --> 01:38.440]  China owned by the very companies pulling out of the US I'm sorry I've got
[01:38.440 --> 01:42.280]  literally 200 articles or more here and I'm getting into stuff it's not even in
[01:42.280 --> 01:44.760]  my stack
[01:44.760 --> 01:53.080]  economist former political president he was arrested over it he publicly was in
[01:53.080 --> 01:57.560]  the Wall Street Journal at the time predicted the 87 stock market crash
[01:57.560 --> 02:03.120]  Black Friday and he predicted the Nikkei fall and several others and when he
[02:03.120 --> 02:09.800]  wouldn't give up his algorithm they threw him in the Husqow which is what
[02:09.800 --> 02:20.000]  they do when freedom fails the best men rot in filthy jails and those that
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.680]  cried appease appease were hung by those they tried to please Martin Armstrong
[02:24.680 --> 02:29.120]  will be joining us in the third hour Joe Biggs and Josh Owens are gonna be in
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.320]  studio with us at the bottom of the next hour because you could almost say when
[02:34.320 --> 02:39.680]  it comes to political news you can quote Johnny Cash I've been everywhere man I've
[02:39.680 --> 02:42.960]  been everywhere well not quiet but I could see a decade down the road if
[02:42.960 --> 02:46.680]  they're still working here they would have been everywhere so many stories I
[02:46.680 --> 02:50.680]  see now we were of course on top of it way before I'm not bragging it's
[02:50.680 --> 02:56.160]  dangerous to be there early but Homan Square revealed how Chicago police
[02:56.160 --> 03:04.920]  disappeared 7,000 people and they even hired former Iraq dungeon keepers to run
[03:04.920 --> 03:09.360]  it and remember none of this was about stopping radical Islamics getting rid
[03:09.360 --> 03:12.400]  of the Bill of Rights and Constitution was about setting the precedent for
[03:12.400 --> 03:16.800]  disappearing Americans and so I want to tie this in to the emergency centers act
[03:16.800 --> 03:22.200]  the civilian inmate labor camp program the army resettlement program
[03:22.200 --> 03:37.200]  declassification program so we're going to be looking at Camp Club FEMA and
[03:37.200 --> 03:42.000]  looking at the exclusive Guardian report well good for the Guardian doing an in
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.160]  depth journalistic report about a year and a half after we did and good job for
[03:48.160 --> 03:50.880]  check dirt everybody else I'm just pointing out that we were there first
[03:50.880 --> 03:54.920]  two years ago then again a year ago and I'm really glad to see it starting to get
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.480]  a lot of coverage now but we're going to give you as Paul Harvey would say the
[03:59.480 --> 04:06.200]  rest of the story Paul Harvey good day I remember listening to Paul Harvey
[04:06.200 --> 04:10.680]  almost every time my dad took me to school as a child he took me to school
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.880]  a lot because mom was at home when he had time he'd drive me in someone's at
[04:14.880 --> 04:20.120]  the school bus I remember him picking me up to are we going to Dallas for
[04:20.120 --> 04:27.360]  business or work always listening to WB AP and now Paul Harvey I'm kind of
[04:27.360 --> 04:31.680]  digressing ladies and gentlemen you know for a while he had his son Paul Harvey
[04:31.680 --> 04:36.040]  Jr. do it and imitate his dad and folks would argue and go no Paul Harvey's alive
[04:36.040 --> 04:43.200]  go no Paul Harvey's not live not senior but again being informed in a nation of
[04:43.200 --> 04:48.960]  nincompoops is a conspiracy theory as I said the fact that women ever had
[04:48.960 --> 04:52.520]  children vaginally will be known as a conspiracy theory the fact that women
[04:52.520 --> 04:58.000]  ever gave milk to their babies will be a conspiracy theory we'll be back
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.760]  get Daniels info wars calm Hillary Clinton said repealing the Second
[05:02.760 --> 05:05.960]  Amendment is worth considering the presidential candidate attacked the
[05:05.960 --> 05:09.680]  Second Amendment during an October 16th town hall meeting and what she said we
[05:09.680 --> 05:13.880]  should consider a nationwide gun ban in a buyback program to eradicate private
[05:13.880 --> 05:17.640]  gun ownership she said that America should practically outlaw guns just like
[05:17.640 --> 05:21.640]  Australia Canada in the UK but she failed to mention that she supported
[05:21.640 --> 05:24.760]  shipping guns to Syrian rebels the majority of whom are either ISIS
[05:24.760 --> 05:28.960]  militants are affiliated with the Islamic State Senator Rand Paul even said she
[05:28.960 --> 05:31.880]  was the biggest cheerleader for distributing guns to these rebels
[05:31.880 --> 05:36.880]  linked to not only ISIS but also al-Qaeda and the al-Nusra front time and time
[05:36.880 --> 05:39.680]  again journalists have interviewed the rebels in Syria and almost all of them
[05:39.680 --> 05:43.200]  admitted they have pledged allegiance to these radical Islamic groups according
[05:43.200 --> 05:45.880]  to journalist Ben Reynolds there's simply no real separation between
[05:45.880 --> 05:50.040]  moderate rebel groups and hardline Salafist allied with al-Qaeda so in
[05:50.040 --> 05:53.240]  other words Hillary thinks that the Second Amendment only applies to al-Qaeda
[05:53.240 --> 05:57.320]  and ISIS once again this is get Daniels info wars calm and keep checking back

[07:16.200 --> 07:20.960]  20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to table salt because

[08:47.560 --> 08:58.960]  us there is a literal overlord globalist operation being launched right now to
[08:58.960 --> 09:03.960]  try to complete their construction of a private run-for-profit above the law
[09:03.960 --> 09:11.240]  world government at the same time there is a smorgasbord an accelerated
[09:11.240 --> 09:17.460]  explosive awakening of people across the planet to exactly what's happening let
[09:17.460 --> 09:22.000]  me just do this as I do occasionally let me just try to give you the headlines
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.800]  and then plunge back into it how about just the headlines on the top of each
[09:27.800 --> 09:35.600]  stack some stacks up to 20 articles thick America is due for a revolution
[09:35.600 --> 09:44.880]  New York Post America is a bomb waiting to explode RT and then we have the
[09:44.880 --> 09:54.440]  globalist pushing to have that meltdown take place look at this stack
[09:54.440 --> 09:58.640]  probably the most important of all the news today if we really dig into it
[09:58.640 --> 10:06.160]  long-term social media is making Millennials less social study finds
[10:06.160 --> 10:12.160]  that's like finding the ocean is blue here's one out of Bloomberg social skills
[10:12.160 --> 10:17.640]  our last line of defense for humans seeking work you know that's what I
[10:17.640 --> 10:23.000]  tell my children every day I say try to make good grades they go to private
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.520]  school now they were homeschooled for a long time they liked it but we we like
[10:26.520 --> 10:35.080]  full-time private schools they can engage in sports swimming and tennis that's
[10:35.080 --> 10:38.880]  what happens when they get older it's a social issue that's fine but I tell them
[10:38.880 --> 10:42.600]  stop pulling your hair out of her homework if you make a b-plus I'm happy
[10:42.600 --> 10:48.920]  stop hyperventilating you got 16 pages of homework you just focus and do it
[10:48.920 --> 10:52.280]  you can be done in an hour and then do whatever you want that I said what
[10:52.280 --> 10:55.920]  really matters is being charming and looking people in the eyes and being
[10:55.920 --> 11:03.400]  funny and folks don't tell their kids that I mean people think the more
[11:03.400 --> 11:07.080]  surly the more arrogant they are the further they're gonna get ahead and
[11:07.080 --> 11:11.640]  that's why you have an ocean of losers out there social media making
[11:11.640 --> 11:16.320]  Millennials less social study finds at CNBC here's another one Bloomberg social
[11:16.320 --> 11:21.800]  skills our last line of defense for humans seeking work they have to write
[11:21.800 --> 11:31.080]  articles telling folks that I was watching CBS News this morning I was on
[11:31.080 --> 11:35.880]  the elliptical and they were telling people how to wash their hair and and
[11:35.880 --> 11:40.720]  what motions to go in with shampoo and then that you didn't need to put soap
[11:40.720 --> 11:44.320]  under your arms when you're in the shower because it's just not good to use
[11:44.320 --> 11:50.520]  soap it was really bizarre and I made me realize the television the mainstream
[11:50.520 --> 11:55.800]  media literally is telling people how to wipe their hind ends that's the old
[11:55.800 --> 12:00.960]  joke of tell me how to wipe my own hind in that's what this has come to but
[12:00.960 --> 12:08.440]  that's their audience arrested development lobotomy heads and I'm not
[12:08.440 --> 12:15.920]  being sarcastic and I don't say that some sardonic power tripping mode these
[12:15.920 --> 12:20.920]  people are hordes of ignorant morons they're black they're white they're
[12:20.920 --> 12:26.240]  Hispanic they're Asian we all see them man they're scary man they're feeble man
[12:26.240 --> 12:32.640]  they're dull-eyed they're walking dead and the Pentagon trains an army Marine
[12:32.640 --> 12:42.200]  Corps Navy Air Force drills to mow down the American people in mass during
[12:42.200 --> 12:48.920]  societal collapse and when we and others and info wars exposed all this they
[12:48.920 --> 12:53.400]  said okay we'll stop practicing mowing down people wearing overalls and John
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.560]  deer hats or mowing down crowds of black people we got footage of that worn
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.280]  folks before the whole race war thing got cooked up by Obama we could see the
[13:01.280 --> 13:07.320]  preparation and predicted it you go to an army base you see hundreds of black
[13:07.320 --> 13:12.120]  roleplayers being put in FEMA camps by troops I mean they're gearing up to grab
[13:12.120 --> 13:16.000]  black folks you know and they're gearing up to grab country people they're gearing
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.120]  up to go after rednecks it for all the problems blacks have and the way they
[13:23.120 --> 13:27.000]  can be misdirected like any other social group at least they do get angry and
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.600]  stand up for themselves sometimes even if it's misguided and I'll quote the
[13:31.600 --> 13:36.640]  full metal jacket statement of the sergeant private joker silly and he's
[13:36.640 --> 13:40.120]  ignorant but he's got guts and guts is enough you notice the government trains
[13:40.120 --> 13:45.840]  to take on Christians gun owners rednecks country boys black people starting
[13:45.840 --> 13:52.600]  to get a pattern here I wouldn't say the indigenous Americans but but the groups
[13:52.600 --> 13:58.080]  that have been here 400 years people that think they got a right to own a gun
[13:58.080 --> 14:01.760]  people that think they've got a right to go to the church they want to Americans
[14:01.760 --> 14:05.400]  are being targeted people that have had a common experience with each other the
[14:05.400 --> 14:10.200]  globalist hate our guts and they're gonna finance black groups to go out and
[14:10.200 --> 14:14.480]  kill police and stuff to then demonize black people in general and then set
[14:14.480 --> 14:20.000]  them up but I'm digressing we already know that so social media making
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.760]  millennials less social really that's what it's designed to do but I mean
[14:24.760 --> 14:28.200]  before he died they asked Steve Jobs you know what kind of iPads or iPhones your
[14:28.200 --> 14:31.320]  kids have he said I don't even let them have screen time much less one of these
[14:31.320 --> 14:36.080]  pads are you kidding I don't want mentally retarded hunchbacks that was his
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.840]  full basically quote that's what it does it makes you mentally retarded and
[14:40.840 --> 14:46.160]  hunchbacked believe me I'm hunchbacked from leaning over computers a little bit
[14:46.160 --> 14:51.160]  three years of stretching and training has got some of my hump reverse but I was
[14:51.160 --> 14:58.080]  going towards a true hump social media making millennials less social we're
[14:58.080 --> 15:01.480]  gonna get into that social skills the last line of defense for humans seeking
[15:01.480 --> 15:08.880]  work but don't worry Oslo aims to make its city car-free within four years that
[15:08.880 --> 15:13.560]  ties into it I'll be getting into that that's two tiny stacks let's move on to
[15:13.560 --> 15:19.960]  this next juicy sources Biden could announce decision within 48 hours Joe
[15:19.960 --> 15:25.000]  Biden will not be bullied by Clinton campaign and who deciding on run now
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.680]  hundreds of Obama bundlers missing from Clinton's elite fundraising ranks put
[15:30.680 --> 15:36.640]  the pieces together connect the dots there then we've got Nancy Pelosi I
[15:36.640 --> 15:41.200]  literally when I just saw her face again when I moved this article and could
[15:41.200 --> 15:49.200]  see her thought that it looked like a cadaver on a slab Pelosi Democrats open
[15:49.200 --> 15:58.600]  to helping GOP elect speaker oh but I digressed back I knew I digress I'll
[15:58.600 --> 16:02.280]  start telling a story that I'll jump to one other part of the story when the
[16:02.280 --> 16:05.560]  public found out that they were training to just mow down thousands of
[16:05.560 --> 16:11.040]  citizens rioting for food during collapse they switched it to oh we're
[16:11.040 --> 16:16.200]  just training to mow down zombies and then they put green paint on everyone to
[16:16.200 --> 16:23.040]  dehumanize the entire mass and then say they're dead already and then I first
[16:23.040 --> 16:27.000]  reported on that about four years ago and people didn't believe me I said no we
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.160]  got military sources they're practicing mowing down human wave attacks but to
[16:32.160 --> 16:35.720]  get around the fact that the troops are saying hey we're practicing killing our
[16:35.720 --> 16:42.720]  countrymen they call it a zombie attack drill but nevertheless that's what's
[16:42.720 --> 16:46.260]  happening and every time I mentioned that without showing an article people
[16:46.260 --> 16:51.360]  don't believe me so guys train search engine military trains to take on
[16:51.360 --> 16:56.200]  zombies you'll have LA Times Associated Press Reuters Army Times Stars and
[16:56.200 --> 16:59.600]  Stripes and it's got the Marines Army and everybody training that we're
[16:59.600 --> 17:03.240]  dehumanized we're dead already and they're gonna mow us all down and that's
[17:03.240 --> 17:08.000]  what we're gonna be covering with our reporters Joe Biggs and Josh Owens at
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.720]  the bottom of the next hour there it is seeing in Pentagon document lays out
[17:11.720 --> 17:16.880]  battle plan against zombies and that's just a battle plan that they actually
[17:16.880 --> 17:22.240]  have the drills so you can find those homes square revealed how Chicago police

[24:51.240 --> 24:57.640]  North Pole that's in CNN more on the big banks to band cash it's all being
[24:57.640 --> 25:05.160]  announced we'll break it down but before I go any further I did want to make the
[25:05.160 --> 25:15.000]  announcement Friday but Peter Schiff who's a von Mies free market economist
[25:15.000 --> 25:22.680]  Patriot former Ron Paul chief advisor was scheduled to be on the show to talk
[25:22.680 --> 25:28.600]  about developments in the market as he is every two weeks every second Friday but
[25:28.600 --> 25:34.400]  he couldn't do it he said my dad's dying right now he's quote passing over to the
[25:34.400 --> 25:41.720]  other side right now and I didn't want to obviously say hey pray for everyone
[25:41.720 --> 25:45.160]  Schiff because that was a private matter at that time he did die a few hours
[25:45.160 --> 25:50.680]  later and then of course his son put out a eulogy a good article yesterday
[25:50.680 --> 25:55.680]  Erwin Schiff passes away Patriot had lifelong affair with our nation's
[25:55.680 --> 25:59.440]  founding principles and I knew Erwin Schiff pretty good worked with him to
[25:59.440 --> 26:02.960]  get a show on Genesis that got on over a hundred stations he was based out of
[26:02.960 --> 26:09.560]  Las Vegas they put him in prison for his book the judge said it was national news
[26:09.560 --> 26:13.760]  was in the Las Vegas for your journal and Wall Street Journal and he in Forbes
[26:13.760 --> 26:17.840]  even said it was political prisoner and said stop publishing this book saying the
[26:17.840 --> 26:21.880]  income taxes of fraud we're gonna put you in jail they put him in jail for 15
[26:21.880 --> 26:29.600]  years the sentence had about a year left he died of cancer on Friday and I went
[26:29.600 --> 26:33.160]  to dinner with him more than 10 times had him on my show countless times yeah
[26:33.160 --> 26:38.080]  of course hadn't been on for over 13 14 years he's been in federal prison and
[26:38.080 --> 26:40.320]  they put him in one where he couldn't even see his family and then the
[26:40.320 --> 26:43.960]  computer recognizes your voice print his voice was so bad the last few months he
[26:43.960 --> 26:47.160]  couldn't even talk to family over the phone prison didn't care wouldn't let
[26:47.160 --> 26:52.560]  him talk to him but his son tried to get there you know for when he died I don't
[26:52.560 --> 26:58.240]  want to get off into the whole Israel thing but I saw a minority of the
[26:58.240 --> 27:05.800]  comments on info wars you know saying why didn't this rat Jew ever speak about
[27:05.800 --> 27:09.520]  the New World Order you know and just all these sickening statements when
[27:09.520 --> 27:13.440]  that's all Erwin Schiff did for like 40 years was fight the New World Order the
[27:13.440 --> 27:20.000]  private Federal Reserve the IRS write books on it and it just the the hatred
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.040]  of different groups of people mindlessly in general by nobodies with a keyboard
[27:25.040 --> 27:32.160]  that don't even know who somebody is is sickening and discrediting and I know a
[27:32.160 --> 27:36.320]  lot of those are bots and haters and leftist operatives that try to make the
[27:36.320 --> 27:39.920]  site look racist and there is a lot of problem with some of the lobbies in
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.120]  Israel and I criticize it and some of the leftist anti-gun groups in Israel
[27:44.120 --> 27:49.560]  financing gun control here and that's legitimate criticism but just mindless
[27:49.560 --> 27:55.800]  hatred of different groups of people and then to just project on to someone that
[27:55.800 --> 28:00.240]  they never fought the New World Order just to say that so you could try to have
[28:00.240 --> 28:08.280]  stolen glory is is sickening and I had a real desire the people writing that
[28:08.280 --> 28:12.960]  stuff to if I saw you to punch you in the nose because he died a political
[28:12.960 --> 28:16.520]  prisoner and could have stopped publishing the book the Federal Mafia
[28:16.520 --> 28:20.040]  and they told him he could come out anytime they would let him be paroled
[28:20.040 --> 28:26.200]  if he just recanted and he wouldn't that's a William Wallace type character I
[28:26.200 --> 28:30.640]  don't care he was black white German Jewish Chinese I can admire people like
[28:30.640 --> 28:34.680]  that and see that's what separates myself from people like the new Black
[28:34.680 --> 28:40.600]  Panther Party of the Ku Klux Klan is that I'm about individuals and what they
[28:40.600 --> 28:44.440]  produce what they stand for can I count on them in a pinch are they honorable
[28:44.440 --> 28:49.400]  like Martin Luther King said we don't judge people on their race but on the
[28:49.400 --> 28:53.320]  content of their character and their deeds and just thank God that I'm in a
[28:53.320 --> 29:00.280]  society the human society where I'm not a member of any group because I wouldn't
[29:00.280 --> 29:03.800]  be a member of any organization that would have me to quote Charlie Chaplin I
[29:03.800 --> 29:09.760]  think that's who said that I'm I'm just in the human race here and I admire
[29:09.760 --> 29:15.360]  humanity and I admire individuals there are a lot of groups I don't like but
[29:15.360 --> 29:24.680]  Erwin Schiff was was an amazing person and I don't know if in that position and
[29:24.680 --> 29:28.680]  a judge said just stop publishing this book I won't put you in prison for 15
[29:28.680 --> 29:33.320]  years would I have the courage facing federal prison to do what he did and
[29:33.320 --> 29:37.840]  go to prison and I probably would have his courage but I haven't proven that I
[29:37.840 --> 29:42.680]  don't want to test that it's just he's a hero and to watch people disparage a
[29:42.680 --> 29:48.680]  dead hero makes me want to kick your ass that's all I have to say we're on the
[29:48.680 --> 29:56.480]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.080 --> 30:03.720]  kid Daniels info wars.com did you know that since 1960 the number of married
[30:03.720 --> 30:08.680]  adults has decreased from 72% down to 51 in other words barely half of all adults
[30:08.680 --> 30:12.840]  in the US are married which is a record low case in point a Catholic pastor
[30:12.840 --> 30:16.680]  recently revealed he's only performing five marriages a year down from 35 over
[30:16.680 --> 30:20.040]  25 years ago in the pastor Charles Pope said other priests have had similar
[30:20.040 --> 30:23.520]  experiences but why are men shying away from marriage and even relationships
[30:23.520 --> 30:26.920]  with women in general well pastor Pope pointed out the obvious radical
[30:26.920 --> 30:30.520]  feminism is destroying marriage by driving a wedge between men and women for
[30:30.520 --> 30:33.720]  one thing thanks to feminism many men are now so terrified of being labeled
[30:33.720 --> 30:37.240]  rapist that they shy away from showing any interest towards women even women
[30:37.240 --> 30:41.080]  who hate feminism and because of that many women now complain they cannot find
[30:41.080 --> 30:44.200]  real men who have the confidence to approach them there's a video report on
[30:44.200 --> 30:47.520]  info wars.com and title why then are giving up on marriage which breaks it

[39:02.080 --> 39:05.760]  lot of new AM and FM affiliates in places like New York City will be
[39:05.760 --> 39:09.520]  announcing that station next week they want us to really build up to it we've
[39:09.520 --> 39:14.080]  been on about a month they're already getting a great response we've got I
[39:14.080 --> 39:18.400]  don't know like 20 something affiliates this last month I can't tell you what
[39:18.400 --> 39:24.400]  drudge coming in did two weeks ago two weeks ago tomorrow we probably had
[39:24.400 --> 39:31.000]  let's not exaggerate 30 station inquiries for AM FM to to info wars and we
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.200]  don't even handle it GCN handles it up Minnesota we had like 30 inquiries or
[39:35.200 --> 39:40.080]  more from AM and FM station saying hey get a hold us we want to get you on so
[39:40.080 --> 39:43.520]  I guess they don't even know to go find GCN we should probably for AM and FM
[39:43.520 --> 39:48.200]  stuff you'll put a link on our affiliate page or a link on the listen page over
[39:48.200 --> 39:52.360]  to GCN and their phone number because the stations end up contacting us but
[39:52.360 --> 39:57.680]  again GCN live comms the network website for folks that want to pick it up but
[39:57.680 --> 40:01.440]  just very exciting things happening and I want to thank you the listeners and you
[40:01.440 --> 40:04.520]  the viewers for doing that but I should add because we have a lot of new
[40:04.520 --> 40:09.680]  affiliates what I was first trying to say that we are simulcast television not
[40:09.680 --> 40:15.080]  just a webcam that myself and others pioneered 15 plus years ago but a full
[40:15.080 --> 40:21.280]  TV news production and you can find those details again at info wars comm
[40:21.280 --> 40:26.600]  forward slash show and more importantly if you've already found it the podcast
[40:26.600 --> 40:31.840]  the droid app the iphone app all of it send that link to friends and family and
[40:31.840 --> 40:39.320]  neighbors tell folks about the show and how there's forbidden information that
[40:39.320 --> 40:51.560]  they need to be made aware of and that is what this is we are forbidden
[40:51.560 --> 40:55.560]  information that the globalist don't want the general public to come in
[40:55.560 --> 40:59.760]  contact with and they're moving heaven and earth right now to try to spike the
[40:59.760 --> 41:03.520]  first amendment in the United States and free speech from Canada to Germany
[41:03.520 --> 41:09.320]  right now to try to shut this information down and people like us down
[41:09.320 --> 41:14.080]  because it's so effective because it's dead on target we know who the globalist
[41:14.080 --> 41:18.960]  are we know their philosophy we know their plans we know their in games we
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.760]  know their weaknesses we know what makes them tick their modus operandi their
[41:23.760 --> 41:32.120]  modes of operation we carry the light in the dark of the night and we're here to
[41:32.120 --> 41:37.640]  set brush fires in the minds of humans across the globe to promote a free open
[41:37.640 --> 41:43.640]  society of free will and free association now before I see other news
[41:43.640 --> 41:48.320]  let's get into Hillary Clinton this is such a big deal that we've had Obama
[41:48.320 --> 41:53.680]  and we've had CNN and we've had all these hosts say hey it's reasonable we'll
[41:53.680 --> 42:05.600]  just do it Australia and the UK did and what they did you know I'm having a
[42:05.600 --> 42:08.400]  Pavlovian response I literally can't look at Hillary more than just put her on
[42:08.400 --> 42:11.640]  screen and she looks like the alien from Mars attacks that comes to the White
[42:11.640 --> 42:19.200]  House she actually has a alien Martian Mellon head I just and I could attack
[42:19.200 --> 42:22.360]  her for all of her crimes and and all the things she's committed and coming
[42:22.360 --> 42:27.400]  after our guns but I just cannot look at her anymore I have a Pavlovian nausea
[42:27.400 --> 42:31.720]  response to looking at her you know what I'm gonna force myself to look put the
[42:31.720 --> 42:38.040]  gorgon back on but Hillary back on screen I have to force myself to look at
[42:38.040 --> 42:53.720]  her so put her on I'm not even being dramatic here okay okay that's enough
[42:53.720 --> 42:57.120]  that's enough that's enough may end up for a minute
[42:57.120 --> 43:13.080]  yes what do they call that therapy aversion therapy my mother I guess
[43:13.080 --> 43:17.000]  she doesn't mind if I tell this story my mother did aversion therapy when I was
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.760]  about five years old for her birthday we budgeted the money because my dad was
[43:22.760 --> 43:26.000]  working two jobs to go through dental school I was about four or five years
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.720]  old don't forget and she went off for a week to this aversion therapy place I
[43:30.720 --> 43:33.920]  think she they was called chic or something you see the ads when I was a
[43:33.920 --> 43:40.360]  kid I didn't see it at the time I was about 12 but in Dallas and you'd go in
[43:40.360 --> 43:43.760]  and there was all these dirty mirrors and like trash all over the floor and
[43:43.760 --> 43:47.560]  piles of cigarettes and ashtrays everywhere and he would sit there and
[43:47.560 --> 43:56.200]  smoke cigarettes one after the other while they shocked you intermittently and my
[43:56.200 --> 44:02.400]  mother never wanted another cigarette again after a week of that I'll tell you
[44:02.400 --> 44:10.400]  but see I've already I've already I've already had the aversion therapy I've
[44:10.400 --> 44:15.080]  already been through the Clintons for 20 plus years on air I know so many crimes
[44:15.080 --> 44:19.080]  they've committed that I it makes my head spin even look at her and so when I
[44:19.080 --> 44:26.080]  look at her it's like showing a meerkat an image of a Cobra you know
[44:26.080 --> 44:29.800]  meerkat's main enemy is Cobras because they go into their holes in Africa and
[44:29.800 --> 44:35.120]  eat them and so when I see Hillary it's like a giant King Cobra is fanned out
[44:35.120 --> 44:40.640]  in front of my desk and it's just like ah and and I'll be here looking at all
[44:40.640 --> 44:44.000]  this news and all the stuff I want to cover and then they'll pop her up on
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.280]  screen with some article and I don't even look at the article now I have a
[44:48.280 --> 44:54.920]  Pavlovian meerkat response of hissing but I guess I should I mean she's gonna
[44:54.920 --> 45:00.200]  try to confiscate the guns Obama's talking about it too she's putting out
[45:00.200 --> 45:06.000]  weird Stalin posters of herself and then she's saying it's totally reasonable
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.920]  it's no big deal it's like changing a tire you know they had automatic weapons
[45:09.920 --> 45:14.320]  which they didn't and they're killing everybody and there's these no spat this
[45:14.320 --> 45:20.480]  raft this this this up taking all these shootings which isn't true and so they
[45:20.480 --> 45:24.800]  just you know said we're gonna buy the guns back and then they didn't turn them
[45:24.800 --> 45:28.880]  in well then they went and got them and she sits there talking to her soft
[45:28.880 --> 45:33.000]  stupid constituents that aren't gonna fight the Civil War they're just gonna
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.200]  cuddle in their you know houses with no power and basically get in the fetal
[45:37.200 --> 45:45.440]  position and hug their Hillary Clinton snuggle toys but when she's on C-span
[45:45.440 --> 45:51.000]  last week it's the constituents the weird women nodding and getting off on
[45:51.000 --> 45:56.520]  the reflected glory of Hillary on to them they've never accomplished anything
[45:56.520 --> 46:02.160]  they are nothing they have incredibly low IQ's they found whatever whatever
[46:02.160 --> 46:07.260]  reason liberals in the Canadian US and British studies are six times more
[46:07.260 --> 46:13.400]  likely to steal six times more likely in all three studies not to give and many
[46:13.400 --> 46:16.720]  times more likely in another study I saw I forget that the tales to have all
[46:16.720 --> 46:21.440]  timers because they're not alive they just fidget around their little group
[46:21.440 --> 46:26.040]  thinkers they have no place in society they help no one most of them don't have
[46:26.040 --> 46:31.760]  kids they watch TV all day and so their brains just start shutting down the body
[46:31.760 --> 46:37.920]  says time to die I'm not of use self-destruct so let's look at the
[46:37.920 --> 46:48.680]  self-hating self-destruct switch creatures who mark dice and our and our
[46:48.680 --> 46:52.520]  reporters go out as well and duplicate we say should we put gun owners in force
[46:52.520 --> 46:56.360]  labor camps yes so we're gonna take our guns and put everybody has guns in
[46:56.360 --> 47:01.040]  prison yes I'm sick of these gun owners and they'll sit back on a power trip at
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.960]  night folks while we're in a FEMA camp feeling powerful even though they
[47:05.960 --> 47:12.400]  probably couldn't deadlift 45 pounds even though they never helped anybody
[47:12.400 --> 47:15.560]  they don't want to help they just have the moral superiority that they're
[47:15.560 --> 47:21.320]  helping people they're the most envious jealous greedy non-giving piles of
[47:21.320 --> 47:24.640]  dog manure the planets that will those actually have use in fertilization
[47:24.640 --> 47:31.320]  excuse me piles of maggot vomit the world has ever seen and I'm sorry it was
[47:31.320 --> 47:35.480]  worse than that it's students signed petition to have gun owners executed in
[47:35.480 --> 47:39.440]  concentration camps yeah he did one where they said execute everybody and
[47:39.440 --> 47:43.240]  torture them the other was with adults man these were college students are
[47:43.240 --> 47:46.720]  adults too but a rest of development they're about five year olds but they
[47:46.720 --> 47:52.560]  hear about the Talitarianism and they get off on it so it was worse than I
[47:52.560 --> 47:57.960]  said excuse me it pretty much always is isn't it we're gonna go inside the FEMA
[47:57.960 --> 48:03.360]  camps in about an hour and well not about an hour about 45 minutes from now
[48:03.360 --> 48:09.000]  but let's go ahead and go to Hillary just up there like it's just something
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.400]  she's letting slide out in church something she kind of wants to not take
[48:13.400 --> 48:19.880]  responsibility for silent but deadly she just is just putting it out there that
[48:19.880 --> 48:23.400]  it's no big deal it's real reasonable we'll just do it Australia did you know
[48:23.400 --> 48:28.240]  total gun confiscation except for single-shot and mass gun buybacks and
[48:28.240 --> 48:33.320]  steam rollers rolling over the guns by the millions it's no big deal then crime
[48:33.320 --> 48:38.200]  exploding let's go ahead and go to the club you know Australia is a good
[48:38.200 --> 48:44.640]  example Canada is a good example the UK is a good example why because each of
[48:44.640 --> 48:48.600]  them had mass killings look at the men at these places had a huge mass killing
[48:48.600 --> 48:53.600]  imagine a beer on 25 20 25 years ago those when Canada did as well creeped out
[48:53.600 --> 49:03.320]  of the UK and in reaction they passed much stricter gun laws in the Australian
[49:03.320 --> 49:09.320]  example as I recall that was a buyback program the Australian government as
[49:09.320 --> 49:15.960]  part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons offered
[49:15.960 --> 49:20.320]  a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns and then they
[49:20.320 --> 49:25.320]  basically clamped down going forward in terms of having you know more of a
[49:25.320 --> 49:31.000]  background check approach more of a permitting approach but they believed and
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.600]  I think the evidence supports them that by offering to buy back those guns they
[49:36.600 --> 49:45.000]  were able to you know curtail the supply and to set a different standard for gun
[49:45.000 --> 49:55.400]  purchases in the future now communities have done that in our country but I
[49:55.400 --> 49:59.200]  think it would be worth considering doing it on the national level if that
[49:59.200 --> 50:08.080]  could be arranged remember I know after the terrible 08 financial crisis and
[50:08.080 --> 50:16.800]  one of the programs that the financial crisis created pretty much by the
[50:16.800 --> 50:19.880]  Democrats I mean that's something that Larry Summers and Bill Clinton and
[50:19.880 --> 50:26.080]  Hillary all cooked up in the 90s Republicans went along with it but if
[50:26.080 --> 50:30.160]  you're informed you realize how dangerous that is but her constituents to a man to
[50:30.160 --> 50:35.960]  a woman their ancestors never had guns their ancestors never stood up for
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.680]  anybody it is alien to them that a man would even know how to fight or a woman
[50:41.680 --> 50:46.640]  would know how to fight back for themselves we've got the socio-economic
[50:46.640 --> 50:51.880]  actuaries the sociology on these people these people are dead already these
[50:51.880 --> 51:00.040]  people basically are walking breathing Alzheimer's machines this hour of GCN

[55:33.880 --> 55:39.320]  itself but no guns for you and a race to domesticate and dumb down the public
[55:39.320 --> 55:43.920]  so that they're so enslaved they really believe owning a gun would be
[55:43.920 --> 55:48.920]  detrimental most Democrats I talked to go if I had a gun I'd kill myself I might
[55:48.920 --> 55:52.720]  blow my own head off I might start killing people I'd go crazy why I'm on
[55:52.720 --> 55:56.840]  psychotropic drugs and I wear women's clothes and I'm crazy and I can't do
[55:56.840 --> 56:03.440]  that that was Buzz Bissinger because after he went on air and said I want to
[56:03.440 --> 56:06.640]  kill Alex Jones with a rifle and then the and then the ambassador's daughter
[56:06.640 --> 56:09.880]  goes yeah peers you could wear a military officer's uniform when you're
[56:09.880 --> 56:16.280]  killing she's going these are deranged loons a gun owner wouldn't get up and
[56:16.280 --> 56:18.920]  talk about shooting innocent people on air they wouldn't talk and then
[56:18.920 --> 56:22.640]  Bissinger goes it's true I'm mentally ill I shouldn't have a gun that's why it
[56:22.640 --> 56:27.240]  freaked me out to think of having one I just want to buy women's clothing and
[56:27.240 --> 56:33.320]  it's like whatever the point is this is how whacked out these people are if I
[56:33.320 --> 56:36.240]  had guns I'd kill people I just want women's clothing and you're just like
[56:36.240 --> 56:42.240]  what does it have to do with anything that's who these people are they're
[56:42.240 --> 56:48.200]  crazy town but even crazier was the ambassador's daughter flushing on air
[56:48.200 --> 56:52.240]  when they talked about killing me and going I mean you know you know what a
[56:52.240 --> 56:54.800]  woman's actually around she's just you'll wear the uniform when you're
[56:54.800 --> 57:01.520]  killing I'll be there I mean it's like what who are these freaks
[57:01.520 --> 57:08.560]  appears she's gonna wear it I mean these people are sick yeah scroll down you
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.400]  can see her right there look at her just oh my gosh yeah yeah and I'm not
[57:13.400 --> 57:20.000]  trying to be sarcastic here she starts going I mean it's killing yeah once we
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.040]  have the guns will kill him and Bissinger's I wear clothes women's clothes
[57:25.040 --> 57:30.480]  murder I mean you know this is who we're fighting it's a mass mental illness
[57:30.480 --> 57:34.200]  wave like hell opened up and demonic spirits came out and they're taking
[57:34.200 --> 57:38.360]  people over or something I don't know maybe it's space aliens but this is not
[57:38.360 --> 57:45.840]  normal yes buzz Bissinger is space alien that's his name right I'm just going
[57:45.840 --> 57:49.720]  from memory or teleprompter free and of course the real problem is people don't
[57:49.720 --> 57:53.280]  have social skills they're losing language people will hear you use a
[57:53.280 --> 57:59.680]  complex word they'll go weird all they can do is just act trendy you go oh and

[59:06.560 --> 59:11.320]  20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to table salt because
[59:11.320 --> 59:14.960]  of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency and iodine was

[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:10.440]  big brother mainstream mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:18.480]  well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:28.840]  austin texas alex jones I was just looking on screen they're running a
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:34.520]  feed of info wars and it's one of those photos of bush at the crawford ranch
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:42.080]  holding hands with the now deceased king sod I guess his brother now runs the
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:49.760]  show and in an adult form and just how bizarre that is to have one of the worst
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.800]  dictatorships in the world and our president kisses these guys on the
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:01:04.200]  lips and then holds their hands and Obama bows down to all this royalty then
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:11.080]  they walk together in the blue bunnets and of course it came out over the
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.520]  weekend what we already knew a new memo there's three of them now confirm that
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:19.080]  Tony Blair fixed intelligence a year before Iraq war making it up that
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:28.760]  Saddam was involved in 9-11 and just how they committed those crimes and then
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:36.400]  now those frauds aren't even as naked to use that key term as what Obama's doing
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:43.400]  I wonder what's the next Republican gonna do if it's not a patriot notice I
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.600]  call them it's now whatever creature comes out of Washington and I look at
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:53.760]  Tony Blair see it was okay because he was trendy he was liberal so it was okay
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.760]  they killed a million Iraqis and it was okay be like George W. Bush because you
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:03.480]  know it was the special relationship oh and there's some special relationships
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:10.000]  going on you can certainly believe that's happening those guys don't age at
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.400]  an accelerated rate four times the normal as presidents or prime ministers for
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.960]  nothing it's not just they get them sleep deprived waking them up all the time
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.160]  to make decisions they put them on all sorts of designer and Fetamine all sorts
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:27.040]  of designer drugs so they're totally controlled and now George W. Bush can
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.560]  barely get out of the bathtub they say he's so drugged out and is in his own
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:41.480]  waxed-out wonderland and then we have people like Jeb Bush lecturing us saying
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.840]  Donald Trump can't be president because he doesn't have the military experience
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.320]  the Bush family does what of chicken-hawking and running and getting
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:55.480]  deferments and getting jobs in the guard back home and then wearing cod pieces
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.520]  30 years later saying mission accomplished literally wearing cod pieces
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:05.120]  and getting out of intruder aircraft in the decks of aircraft carriers why not
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.160]  wear a Superman outfit for heaven's sakes instead of a black cod piece you
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:16.120]  can have a red one you're either with the cod piece or you're against the cod
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.400]  piece but if you want to know why all this is happening and what the bigger
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.000]  picture is when we come back we're going to get into the replacement of humans
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.120]  with machines and how that ties into first deliberately making sure we're
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.080]  not humans to begin with because it's a metaphysical crime to enslave and
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:40.920]  murder to enslave suck dry a singly eight and then murder a humanoid in the
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:45.240]  globalist system but if you can first turn them into selfish gibbering
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:50.600]  mindless programmable machines that run around not wanting to have any
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.640]  accomplishments but actually just feeling trendy and feeling like they're
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:00.720]  superheroes then you can go ahead and take those folks out and they'll
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:05.640]  willingly go along with the inoculations the GMO and then the
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:11.920]  subsequent healthcare actuary designed to remove whatever capital you or your
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:21.200]  parents had accrued from you before you are pushed out into the stratosphere out
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.240]  of the end of a incinerator
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:39.120]  chimney so when we return we will get into all of it bigger bite for health
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.280]  law penalty on uninsured associated press wait a minute there was no penalty
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:49.200]  the media said so they said it was racist that drudge and alex jones said
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:53.360]  that and that there was no penalty and it was a conspiracy theory but why do
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.800]  they now say there's a big penalty
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:02.760]  kit Daniels info wars calm Hillary Clinton said repealing the second
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.920]  amendment is worth considering the presidential candidate attacked the
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.640]  second amendment during an october 16th town hall meeting in which she said we
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.840]  should consider a nationwide gun ban in a buyback program to eradicate private
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.480]  gun ownership she said that america should practically outlaw guns just
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:21.640]  like australia canada in the uk but she failed to mention that she supported
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:24.760]  shipping guns to certain rebels the majority of whom are either isis
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.560]  militants are affiliated with the islamic state senator ran paul even
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.880]  said she was the biggest cheerleader for distributing guns to these rebels
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.880]  linked to not only isis but also al-qaeda and the al-nuzra front time and time
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.680]  again journalists have interviewed the rebels in Syria and almost all of them
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.200]  admitted they have pledged allegiance to these radical islamic groups according
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.560]  to journalists been rentals there's simply no real separation between moderate
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:50.440]  rebel groups and hardline Salafist allied with al-qaeda so in other words
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.040]  Hillary thinks that the second amendment only applies to al-qaeda and isis

[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:19.840]  many times I've seen it happen where the CIA British intelligence Saudi
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:26.240]  intelligence and others have been caught creating fake al-Qaeda and now fake
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:36.360]  ISIS propaganda videos the first time it was about 2006 and they caught the
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:45.600]  Pentagon through the Intel Center run by Rumsfeld uploading Adam Goodon the
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.680]  grandson of the head of the ADL at the time who'd been arrested and stuff for
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:56.800]  beating up Muslims he was then supposedly number two in al-Qaeda and Lex
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:03.120]  Luther works for Superman or vice versa and they uploaded the al-Qaeda bug in
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:09.240]  the same Pentagon bug and Wired magazine at a big tech conference exposed it as
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.600]  fake now any idiot could look at it and see it was produced and totally fake
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.080]  it's kind of like they're over 500 legitimate militia groups in this
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:22.240]  country and I saw the Atari militia out of Mexico out of Michigan a few years
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:28.320]  ago and I could see how the video was shot and what they were saying with a
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.720]  guy standing behind the leader wearing a gas mask and I said that is out of
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:38.360]  central casting to set up this militia it's run by feds I can tell you right
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:45.080]  now they're going to probably set them up and the feds got scared because I
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.600]  blew their operation jump too fast and indicted the leader and others for
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.320]  simply saying if there's a UN takeover they might have to work with the local
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:59.080]  government to fend off a UN takeover and they called that planning to overthrow
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:03.120]  the US government and plan to kill police and the federal judge finally
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:08.440]  ordered them released after three years so I mean I know something fake when I
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:14.000]  see it but there's a new article and video up on info wars.com son of
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:23.080]  Hollywood director has now been caught in these new films I mean it's just
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:32.760]  totally and completely fake here's a little news flash Al Qaeda and ISIS
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.880]  aren't seven and a half feet tall like those Kubrick level you know quality
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.880]  shots by the Dead Sea and it shows seven and a half foot tall men chopping
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.840]  people's heads off it's just not real. British son of Hollywood movie director
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.800]  26 is revealed as bloodthirsty star of Al Qaeda propaganda videos after
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.000]  converting from Catholicism and smuggling himself to Syria he didn't convert
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:08.600]  from Jack Diddly squad he's got a job as a director with the CIA so that's the
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:14.840]  type of news we've got here just to get into how ridiculously fake all of this
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:23.400]  is. We have Martin Armstrong the forecaster who predicted the 87 crash
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.640]  predicted other major crashes predicted some of the biggest bull markets
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:32.840]  he's on record he was in the CNBC Wall Street Journal New York Times at the time
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:39.920]  he wouldn't give his algorithm up to the feds whether that algorithm was dead
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.560]  reckoning looking at graphs and was his own idiot savant mind not saying he's an
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:52.400]  idiot savant or whether he really hid the algorithm from him is a non-issue he
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:12:05.160]  was a political prisoner so he will be joining us in the third hour today and
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.720]  he certainly understands what socialism is versus capitalism and what Bernie
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:18.200]  Sanders is trying to do with his major push so that is coming up today the
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.880]  toll-free number to join us if you like to talk about Hillary saying that she
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.720]  wants to try to organize a move to have Australian nationwide gunbands of
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.680]  everything down but to single-shot are you concerned about that are you gonna
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.760]  speak out against that we're gonna be breaking that down the toll-free
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:44.760]  number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-2599-231 specifically though on the
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.400]  2nd Amendment I'm gonna take some calls on that front and that front only I mean
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:56.560]  if you want to get into social media making millennials less social I'd like
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.240]  to hear from you on that or social skills are last line of defense for human
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:06.280]  seeking work that's like Bloomberg having a headline you know inhale oxygen
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.480]  into your lungs or you will die but the average person thinks the more arrogant
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:16.400]  the more conceited the more petulant they are that they're gonna get ahead in
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:22.800]  life because that got them ahead at least in their own mind in high school but
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:27.320]  first let's go to the trailer for the hit film that we're gonna be reviewing and
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:35.120]  discussing in the third hour the forecaster here it is it starts in
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:43.280]  August of 1999 Yeltsin is gonna run for election in 2000 to get Yeltsin to take
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:51.280]  seven billion dollars from the IMF loans now they threaten Yeltsin you're not
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.040]  going to run for election in 2000 otherwise all this is gonna come out
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:11.240]  that you stole ten billion dollars from the IMF this is how Putin gets in we all
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:15.920]  know something is wrong the reason we have this crisis is because since World
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.720]  War two they basically borrowed year after year he didn't want to go to college
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:25.520]  he father said you got to do something so he enrolled him at the RCA computer
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:30.800]  store I thought I could create a system that stores the knowledge of century to
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.600]  predict the future the entire trading community would scramble to see and
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:41.200]  signals as soon as they were released he predicted the top in the Nikai index
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.920]  Universal Bank of Lebanon says listen could you make a model and the computer
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.200]  says your country's just gonna completely fall apart in a day obviously that
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:55.840]  prediction was correct they realized that the model to forecast the rise or
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:01.120]  fall of a nation they wanted that source code which is text we want the source
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:10.120]  code I said not getting it sorry the government came in they shut down
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.080]  everything seized all the accounts I had friends they said we put up the money
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:20.640]  in cash tonight he's held with the worst of the worst he wasn't backing down and
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:26.200]  didn't seem like they were either and he said to his mom they want what I've
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:31.640]  spent my entire life developing and I'm not giving it to them
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:44.960]  and be the second time he's visited us he's coming on to give us his breakdown
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.840]  on current developments what he thinks gonna be happening the markets in the
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:57.920]  third hour about 45 minutes from now I've got Joe Biggs and Josh Owens popping
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.960]  in to talk about a year and a half ago and then again a year ago when they
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:10.000]  traveled up to Chicago to cover the Homan Square FEMA camp substation and
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:18.320]  now it's become big news in the United States and England so we're going to break
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.840]  some of that down with them for about ten minutes and then I will go to your
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:27.120]  phone calls and towards the end of the hour I'm gonna get to this key piece of
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.640]  news that I've already talked about some but it's just such a big deal social
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.360]  skills our last line of defense for human seeking work see first they get
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.080]  rid of the industrial economy the agrarian economy the local economy by
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:45.120]  design not with free market but by rigging the economy on record that's
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.760]  even the financial times of London today they admit that the crony capitalism
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:56.760]  article and then they get rid of the service jobs and they've societally
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.400]  gotten rid of the communication skills as well and parents have also let their
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:08.160]  kids be raised by the television it is a perfect storm and I'll either young
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.920]  people are either incredibly awakened involved or they are these greedy
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:21.320]  hateful zombies who have no empathy and think violence is funny even when it's
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:27.960]  happening to their own family they're basically gone they're gone they were
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.200]  never there the their brains are wired different their IQs are low their
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.200]  language skills are low they don't have any common sense they don't have empathy
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:42.440]  they're gone and that's what they set us up for we'll already be gone and
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:47.280]  psychologically on average extinct spiritually extinct when the machines
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.920]  take over and here's the headline Samsung to make robot cheaper than any
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:57.440]  human worker let's go to Brandon in FEMA region 3 what former state are you
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:05.000]  now in sir under FEMA 3 Virginia George Washington Country where they had their
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.160]  big conference last week admitting that their main enemy is veterans and gun
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.640]  owners and saying they're setting up a new domestic force to come after us yes
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:21.280]  please continue I wanted to start off by getting into some good news on the gun
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.480]  front as well as the drug war front there's a bill in the Virginia House of
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:30.640]  Representatives they actually allow open carry without a concealed carry
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.600]  permit and several states the laws have just gone in this month yeah it's it's
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:38.560]  really happening and the criminals have less and less areas to feed on people the
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.800]  happy hunting grounds are very small now areas of Maryland areas of Illinois
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:48.040]  areas of New York areas around DC there's not a lot of happy hunting ground now
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:53.200]  is there and I also wanted to tell you there's also I went to a steep also
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.840]  meeting about a week ago and there's actually been a lot of up for about
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:00.960]  getting rid of civil asset forfeiture seizure laws because of the phony drug
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:04.600]  war when it's come out on record that the CIA runs the drugs and Wall Street
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:10.480]  launders the money and so as it looks like we may actually be gaining some
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:17.000]  ground on getting rid of civil asset forfeiture which is completely unconstitutional
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:22.160]  and Gary Webb helped expose it and then now it's just done at the federal level
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.280]  by the FBI and all these other agencies but I wanted to actually get your
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:33.280]  opinion on what you think is the solution to getting rid of the drug war as
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.120]  well as all these other criminal operations that are used to take our
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.360]  victims well you know it's funny you say that because I was just about to talk
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:48.800]  about that today Richard Branson a virgin Atlantic brands has come out as a
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:54.320]  UN envoy and says they're going to soon announce global decriminalization of
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:00.160]  all drugs says Richard Branson and I want to break down that's in the
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:09.760]  independence today and I appreciate your call exactly what's happening a they
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:14.480]  know worldwide the people of the planet have turned against the phony drug wars
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:21.200]  and realize it's only used to keep the price up and to be able to
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:26.720]  incarcerate large numbers of nonviolent offenders who make very good workers for
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:32.360]  25 cents an hour in prison industries driving down the overall outside wage
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:40.560]  further than even illegal aliens can they also the elite have gotten scared by
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:45.640]  drug cartels they can't control and the trillion dollars a year worldwide and
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.760]  drug purchases 500 billion a year of which is just in the United States we
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:58.480]  use half the world's illegal drugs look it up and so they want to segue into
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:04.920]  quasi legalizing it to control it and tax it but they're still going to allow a
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:11.320]  smaller underground black market which they will control and so they're going
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:19.080]  to have a synthesis a dialectic of the two meshed of the next 20 years as they
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:26.560]  completely phase out illegal drugs and move into psychotropic hallucinogenic
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.160]  and other designer drugs that will for all intents and purposes end free will
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:36.520]  as we know it it'll make ecstasy or PCP look like child's play stuff already out
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:42.520]  there being tested on the military suicide pills where you feel like you're in
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:46.240]  heaven for 12 hours and then just die I mean just hell on earth already being
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:51.760]  released are to being tested but the globalist or social engineers they do
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:56.400]  all this very very slowly but here's the big secret they always knew this was
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:01.680]  going to happen they wrote big white papers on in the 50s once they've
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.960]  broken up the family once they federalize the local police once they've
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:11.080]  internationalized the federal government and once they phased out the
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:19.600]  official drug war they're going to simply move on and use the giant apparatus
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:23.880]  of federalized local police that get about half their funding on average in
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.720]  many cities and counties and jurisdictions from asset for which is
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:33.680]  seizure they're going to make asset for which is seizure about agenda 21 zoning
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:37.600]  so you'll have your home taken if your seven-year-old drops a battery in the
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:43.520]  grass your neighbor will get 20% of the arrest fee and the and the the the
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:51.400]  fines for discovering that if you burn a cook stove out on your back 40 you will
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.520]  be swat teamed and be sent to prison for you know five six years and will be
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:59.920]  charged a hundred thousand dollars I mean this is the admitted plan so they're
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:04.600]  going to replace the whole phony drug war and all the addicted police on all
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:10.880]  that dirty drug money with now the green police and the family police and the
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:15.520]  vaccine police so they trained them on the drug war knowing conservatives would
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.840]  go along with the police state in the name of fighting the drug culture which
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:23.760]  has a lot of problems in it is the CD underbelly it's what criminals get into
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:28.280]  so it is really bad news so the law and order folks bid on that with Nixon
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:34.480]  Reagan right through to Obama's a day that'll be slowly phased out but we
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:43.560]  need the federalized local police on to new new milk memories new new new
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:49.360]  supplies and the new blood supply because it's not really milk it's blood is
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:56.640]  going to be going after the designer drugs going after counterfeit sports
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:01.120]  memorabilia I mean you name it it's a whole spectrum of stuff but mainly it's
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.920]  environmental green police who are all arming to the teeth right now it'll be
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.040]  auxiliaries and it's going to be let's not exaggerate probably five times worse
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:14.480]  than the you think the drug wars back they're going to find something in your
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:17.600]  house they're going to find something in your walls they're going to find
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.520]  something in your paint remember the headline a few years ago 15 million
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:29.080]  dollar fine for garage sale that's associated press Fox News headline type
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:35.080]  it in 15 million dollar fine and that's on the books now it was on the books to
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.080]  take blood from you when you get a driver's license I put that in my
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:45.520]  first film in 1997 America destroyed by design and just now in District of
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.000]  Columbia and then one other state are they starting random blood-taking when
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.960]  you get a driver's license and there it is new government policy not a law
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:25:05.440]  imposes strict standards on garage sales 15 million dollar fine one million on
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.840]  your first offense 15 million on your second you go well what is it banning
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:16.520]  them essentially they go back more than 40 years with a computer that scans your
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:21.880]  goods and if anything was ever recalled at factory level or store level and
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.680]  you're reselling it you didn't know that Barbie doll was recalled because they
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:29.240]  had comes off in baby's mouths you didn't know that paint you were selling
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.480]  from 10 years ago was recalled you didn't know the painting you were
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:38.920]  selling had recalled oil paint there will be no mercy and so that's why now
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:44.800]  the new police are all leftist and they're building a perfect world so they
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.760]  they're letting us win the fight against the phony drug war to segue into
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:56.880]  Agenda 21 which micromanages every facet of human life from gardening to
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:05.040]  agrarian to small shops to auto parts and auto repair to just just the entire
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:10.520]  economy Australia already has it where they actually swat team your house
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:17.120]  under the law if you didn't put in the quote vinyl siding you were supposed to
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.120]  or the cock in the window seals and people say well that does hurt our
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:25.000]  energy you should but see how it sets that precedent and remember the green
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.640]  police had five years ago during the Super Bowl I told you that was what
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.800]  they're gonna really do and then a year later the mayor of San Francisco said
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.480]  they helped produce it with the feds without he and that this was meant to
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:41.240]  prepare you to be arrested if you took to hot a bath or had the wrong lightbulb
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:47.680]  they're not playing games their carbon cuts alone will kill a billion people in
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:56.640]  the third world the first decade they're coming so you need to understand
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.320]  that I don't know of anyone else who understands this like I do and that's a
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:05.080]  very lonely place to be no one else understands they're getting rid of the
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:11.760]  drug war to segue it into the new green police carbon tax system the
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.320]  inoculation medical police that they're still going to take your kids when they
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.760]  blood test you when you're having a baby if you've got anything in you even a
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.920]  legal prescription I mean it's going to be worse than it ever was the prison
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.880]  population is only going to get much bigger now but who they want to
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:32.960]  institutionalize is families that have been maybe 50 generations not in
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:37.680]  prison 50 generations genetically not committing crime generation for
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:43.960]  generation building they want to break that in the epigenetics and they want
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:53.960]  to put you spiritually in a you know 10 by 8 cell of your lucky and break your
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:28:00.080]  will and spiritually feed off innocent people in dungeons their religion is
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.880]  about taking small children and raping them their religion is about putting you
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.880]  in solitary confinement for no reason their religion is about dominating the
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:14.560]  human spirit and hurting it see psychopaths when they grab a woman or a
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.360]  child they like women and children because they tend to grovel more and
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.360]  there's a power trip most psychopaths most serial killers don't like to kill
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.440]  men because men will start flopping around screaming and biting their tongue
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:30.120]  off and not caring they'll beg a little but not too long until they start
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.760]  cursing you to hell and things and psychopaths don't like that they like
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:37.360]  about a three-year-old that'll beg and sob for about 12 hours a day and they
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.640]  just sit there in the dark wearing devil mask torturing the baby because they
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:45.640]  are feeding on and they will feed on you and your family because you let them
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:51.120]  and they're gonna hurt you real bad but they can't get you and your children you
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:55.160]  know on a regular basis down in the dungeon to have you know to torture you
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:58.760]  till the baby finally gives up goes into catatonic state they call it using it
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:03.520]  up as a three-year-old or a you know ten-year-old girl or five-year-old boy
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.800]  they can usually torture women better and terrorize them better so they can
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:15.120]  women's the favorite and and so on a mass scale they want to do this and
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:18.000]  really take their time with you women so the government's there to help you
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.040]  and they're gonna give you all the shots all the medicine to make sure they
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:23.960]  kill you real slow they're gonna make sure they screw you up if you have a

[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.920]  slow and take your time using you up and then no when they're done they'll
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:40.960]  incinerate your body and heat the hospital with the heat from it as they
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.360]  now do in America and then they'll all sit there and laugh at you while they
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.560]  murder you so I just thought you might want to know what they're planning next
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:53.680]  with the we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.880]  radio network
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:03.640]  kid Daniels info wars calm did you know that since 1960 the number of married
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:08.200]  adults has decreased from 72% down to 51 in other words barely half of all
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:12.280]  adults in the US are married which is a record low case in point and Catholic
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:15.560]  pastor recently revealed he's only performing five marriages a year down
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.640]  from 35 over 25 years ago in the pastor Charles Pope said other priests have had
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:22.880]  similar experiences but why are men shine away from marriage and even
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.200]  relationships with women in general well pastor Pope pointed out the obvious
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:30.200]  radical feminism is destroying marriage by driving a wedge between men and women
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:33.640]  for one thing thanks to feminism many men are now so terrified of being labeled
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:37.120]  rapist that they shy away from showing any interest towards women even women
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:41.000]  who hate feminism and because of that many women now complain they cannot find

[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:26.200]  resistance Alex Jones my guests are going to leave us here in about 10
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:32.400]  minutes we'll go to Eric Woody Drake John and others that are patiently
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:41.080]  holding and every few months I use the criminology parallel of what psychopaths
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:47.960]  to do with women and children that they torture for enjoyment as an example of
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:54.080]  what the elite are doing on a wider scale in World War two over a hundred
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.720]  million people died total the vast majority civilians so no matter how
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:05.960]  horrific something I talk about is the reality of it is truly far worse so I
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:11.200]  believe what I'm saying and I can prove it and when I get into all these
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:15.080]  examples of what they want to do to you and your family at the top it's all
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:20.520]  done through compartmentalization where 99% of the people carrying it out don't
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:27.160]  know what they're part of but there is a mass rollout of indefinite detention
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:31.560]  under the NDAA of citizens being disappeared and homeland security is
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:36.640]  gearing up saying the new big push and the new main national security strategy
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.280]  is to prepare for a war with returning veterans veterans gun owners
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:47.400]  conservatives libertarians and Christians we have given you five of the
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:51.720]  eight secret memos that have been leaked in the last seven years we have broken
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:57.000]  them first on record we're not bragging just we know what we're talking about and
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.360]  now they've announced the new brigade homeland to interface with the new
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:05.360]  Justice Department secret police run by the Southern Poverty Law Center an
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:16.040]  extremely wicked organization to target said groups in a new war so they're
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:21.280]  moving into a much larger operational phase now you need to know about it
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:29.160]  exposing it may allow us to back them off but when I see a story like home
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:34.280]  square home and square revealed how Chicago police disappeared 7,000 people
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:39.680]  London Guardian well we were there last year Joe Banks and Josh Owens we're
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:46.000]  going to give you the rest of the story because this is only a training center
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.920]  to prepare police who have been sent their nation want to be trained how to
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:57.160]  disappear people in the next phase for good so when I say let's not just fight
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:00.800]  with the police that's because that's meant to make them become federalized we
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:07.160]  need to though show this is going on under the feds who are behind it they're
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:11.480]  not going to reform the police so that's coming up in just one moment with our
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:15.160]  guest before we go any further they were pointing out hey you might want to add

[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:01.920]  got to make those decisions when I get off air today so take advantage of that
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:05.320]  now and know you're funding the very tip of the spear in the fight against the
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:14.520]  globalist I take a sincere pleasure in the fact that we have sold a huge amount
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:19.400]  of Hillary for prison shirts and that we can fund in the last three months a
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:24.920]  large part of our operation off of a good high-quality shirt that causes
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:29.040]  debate that causes discussion that's hardcore political free speech to
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:33.320]  exercise that so we don't lose it a win-win and Joe Biggs by the way has
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:37.880]  really helped in publicity stunts that he's pulled it in which we admit we've

[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:52.080]  any more of this okay but this is what's going on this is what's being
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:56.440]  prepared and when you have a police department you can say Chicago's
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:59.960]  collapse you can say it's a war they've taken the guns they ship the drugs in
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:04.160]  Chicago distributes drugs for the entire Midwest and then into the other parts
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.160]  of the country because the mafia used to completely run it now the globalists
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:12.960]  run it in the 70s and 80s this the US Army cleared out the mafia with hit
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:16.720]  teams and then fully took it over for themselves believe me I know I'm just
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:21.120]  gonna stop right there for I get people in trouble the point is is that it's
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.440]  totally run out of there and then the cops go around putting gangbangers in
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.800]  these things till they confess without lawyers or due process where they've
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:34.240]  also been tortured they hire former torturers to run this base bring out of
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.080]  Joe Biggs and our guest on this now and so finally it's in the London
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:44.520]  Guarding on the Chicago Tribune that 7,000 people were disappeared and you
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:48.000]  can argue hey it's a tough city blah blah blah the point is the feds are
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.320]  involved the feds are staffing it the Pentagon's involved they want a main
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:56.680]  line what Joe Biggs saw in Iraq in Afghanistan with these black sites so I
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:00.680]  want you to speak about what you guys saw there into the next segment what you
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:07.400]  saw there what you witnessed overseas and then where you see all this going
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.760]  Josh Owens who was there doing camera work and Joe Biggs there reporting go
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:14.280]  ahead well I mean it's definitely an eerie place to be I mean when you get
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:18.080]  there you're looking around and you're kind of like I don't think that's really
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.040]  going on in there but then you're gonna chance start talking to people and you
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.920]  hear the stories you hear the the rumors of these officers literally just like
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:29.840]  throwing bags over people's heads picking them up in these SUVs you know in
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:33.040]  full battle rattle these guys like they're about to you know storm Normandy
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:36.320]  or something taking people throwing them in there not letting them contact a
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.440]  lawyer not letting them you know have any rights whatsoever essentially a lot of
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:46.280]  these guys have said that they were held down and forced heroin and different
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:51.800]  drugs truth serums we've known now time and time again from Guantanamo Bay but
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:56.760]  by the way it's now confirmed this is a CIA substation testing local police to
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:00.280]  prepare them to see if they'll do anything but none of the torture that
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:04.200]  even worked at Guantanamo led to any intelligence whatsoever what makes them
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:08.880]  think that it's going to lead to any kind of intelligence or whatever on drugs in
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:12.600]  that area the funny thing is that there's a huge psychological operation
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:19.120]  happening in Chicago across the entire country the fact that Chicago is a
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:25.240]  Democrat run state I mean Illinois Chicago that's Obama's old place why
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:29.120]  is it the time and time again the majority of minorities continue to vote
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.080]  for these people who are throwing them in these places and not giving them
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:37.960]  rights and yet Obama comes out and says black lives matters well Obama if black
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:41.640]  lives matter why don't you shut down this home in square in Chicago why don't
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:45.120]  you do something about it if you actually cared but you haven't done
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:50.640]  anything well just last week more CIA black sites got exposed in Romania in
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.160]  Poland in Germany and now there's lawsuits over that and they're not even
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:57.960]  taking real terrorists and torturing them that's bad enough they're taking
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:02.560]  innocent people businessmen they're now mainlining this against the
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:06.960]  populations of the world where they just disappear people yeah they they raided
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:10.840]  a sore in Chicago took a whole group of people in there held them they said it
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:15.560]  that they were you know chained to the floor chained to a wall new one guy had
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:21.480]  his his testicles stomped on by a police officer guy said that they saw
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:24.720]  puddles of blood they heard screams throughout the night that's something
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:28.400]  that you hear that's something that I heard personally in Afghanistan that's
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:32.080]  horrible that's something you would never think of hearing about here but again
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:35.320]  they even denied what happened in Afghanistan Iraq now it's admitted
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:40.120]  widespread DEA CIA all of them with feds that come back here even local SWAT
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:43.920]  teams go and train overseas in this whole integration tell people how many
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:47.720]  times you delivered folks to be tortured and how many times you saw roughly
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.840]  people be killed you know dead bodies would come out afterwards I mean you
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:54.640]  know when you're out there they lie to you you don't know that at the time you're
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:57.480]  kind of you know gung-ho thinking that you're doing I'm sure I'm not judging you
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:00.360]  it takes courage and metal I mean yeah you know so you're out here on a mission
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:02.960]  you're like all right this is a target this is a bad guy we got to go get them
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:07.200]  so you go in you have these asymmetric warfare guys you have all these OGA guys
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.160]  other government agencies people come in and they're like all right we got to get
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:13.200]  this guy they take them they take them back to a little place and then like
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:17.360]  all right stand guard they take some guys in some guys with beards come in you
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:20.560]  don't have any kind of name tags or you know patches or anything like that you
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:23.280]  don't know who they're with what they're doing they just go in and then you hear
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:27.600]  screams sometimes they come out sometimes they don't sometimes you know the
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:30.600]  shift change happens and then you're going there again and say hey has this
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:33.680]  guy been pulled out yet now he's been there for at least a day now still going
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:36.640]  at it you know there's a lot of horrible stuff that happens and it's
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:40.560]  sickening to see that that stuff is carrying over here into the country and
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:44.480]  you described these as almost like medical like a dental lab oh yeah it was
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.040]  nasty like you know chairs and those cold metal tables where they'll kind of
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:54.040]  put you down with straps stuff like that and then come to find out one of the
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:57.560]  guys that actually worked in home and squared worked at Guantanamo. Sure of
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:02.000]  course. So they're taking these tactics that you would use for hardened terrors
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:07.440]  and they're now using them on everyday citizens just to. I'll tell the story
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:10.960]  again and I talked to my dad again last night over there at his house and he
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:14.040]  told me everything for our own safety I need to get it out now he called him his
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.880]  uncle but it was his first cousin lived across the street was an army officer
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.200]  and then his son just got on the army 35 years and he died a year and a half ago
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:27.920]  and he told my dad because you know they play 42 and stuff and go deer hunting
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:31.880]  decades ago why he got out of the army because he never really left the army
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:34.600]  I don't like Buckley's dad never really left the army went to Guantanamo he was
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:38.400]  still in the army and it was all these army guys they're giving speeches about
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:41.120]  it you know when we read his funeral home button when he continued on the army
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:44.960]  and everything said he was out of the army same deal but Pat Lynn was in the
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:50.520]  army Pat Lynn Simmons and they sheep dipped him in and he just said it was
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.480]  totally upside down he was doing some for the CIA in killing people's we told
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:59.840]  my dad and he said he got so bad in Chicago so upside down he said it was
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:04.120]  the most horrible things you could imagine and he was tough he was mean he
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:08.080]  wasn't some I mean you think they'd hire for the stuff he was meaner now and a
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:15.360]  loving guy but tough and I mean serious and I mean I remember when he cooked
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:18.240]  rabbits for dinner he just he wouldn't even use a paddle or whatever to break
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:21.360]  her neck he just reach right in and pull her head right off you know that's kind
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.640]  of got us grab a rabbit rip the head right off and not like it was a big deal
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:28.680]  he just wound up rabbits and rip their heads off for dinner you know and he
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.600]  told my dad it was he didn't tell my dad the details but he said it was the most
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.800]  horrible stuff you could imagine he said America he knew then was upside down
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:42.000]  and Chicago's like the battleground for all this stuff I'm sorry to erupt we're
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.960]  gonna skip this break last one I'm doing this week period because I got to stop
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:50.720]  now but I this is so important just to understand what is shimmering underneath
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:55.040]  the surface of all this stuff go ahead yes so I mean exactly it is some of the
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:58.440]  most horrible stuff you could ever see witness here and like I said a lot of
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:01.120]  times that's the stuff that kind of creeps up in your head and dreams at night
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.160]  when you when you lay down a lot of things it'll keep you up at night as
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:07.560]  well but it is disgusting to see something like that happen here and the
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.120]  fact that people have this information now they can see it but still ignore the
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:16.080]  fact that that's what's going on and then you have these large groups of
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.520]  minorities still voting for these kind of people to be put back in power that
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:23.600]  allow this to happen like when you read this report right here this is most of
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:26.720]  the people that were held they were black that is a Democrat state they
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:31.360]  continue to get in the psychological mind screw up where they continue to vote
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:36.400]  these people in and they continue to be held as prisoners I just don't understand
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:39.640]  how people allow this to happen I mean what did you think about it all well
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.200]  yeah it was a crazy place and let's not forget that there's a high school right
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:44.960]  next to it so it's almost like it's hidden like they don't want people to
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:49.200]  know what's going on in there but I mean it's south side Chicago it's called
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.720]  shy rack it's one of the most violent places in the country I think it's
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:56.320]  important not to forget that it also has the strictest gun laws in the country
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:59.400]  yep well that's the thing they're gonna argue yeah we're doing this cuz it's
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:03.120]  rough we got to get tough the drugs are shipped in by the government it's
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:06.880]  laundered by the government they want the people have guns they created this
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:12.480]  artificial environment the government controls the mafia completely since the
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:17.720]  70s they are the mafia yeah I mean there's no other way around it I mean
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:21.280]  like you said they've taken the gun so you as a citizen there if you're a law
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:24.440]  abiding citizen have no way to defend yourself from the criminals and thugs
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:29.840]  that they brought in created by this drug or this war on drugs I mean it's
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:34.200]  completely and totally disgusting this stuff is allowed to happen
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:39.840]  well Joe you know about all this stuff overseas but a magic just imagine how
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:43.880]  big this is under the surface yeah I mean that's what we said last time we were
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:46.200]  driving through there and actually looking at the building we're filming
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:51.160]  some of the reports I was sitting there telling us like if this one is here and
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:54.160]  we know about this one wonder how many more across the country there that we
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:52:00.520]  don't know about how long is it gonna take for these places to be exposed how
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:04.800]  many people besides the 7000 here how many more have been held without their
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:08.880]  rights how many more people been tortured how many more people people's
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:14.040]  lives are gonna be affected by that torture I mean to be a normal person
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:18.440]  walking on the road and then a group of armed thugs grab you and chain you new
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:22.360]  to the ground and put you in stress positions while you know strobe lights
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:26.680]  are going off and horrible music for hours on end that psychologically
[01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:33.240]  sprues you up I mean you can't go back to a normal life after that I just look
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:36.320]  at these Hillary supporters when she's up there saying we need to go ahead and
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:40.280]  look at having nationwide gun confiscation and I look at how soft and
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:44.120]  disconnected and not in reality they are and how they love living in these
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:47.840]  cities have the highest crime rates and how they're fed on they're just
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:53.040]  incredible victims but they're also dangerous and despicable I'm just sick
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:53:00.600]  of them yeah I like I said that the greatest analogy for the the Hillary
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:03.640]  Clinton thing was like a train full of idiots derailed and tipped over and
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:10.960]  everyone's spilt into that that arena there I mean it was literally like a an
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:14.840]  apocalyptic type deal where these zombies were just like you know walking
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:19.680]  around with their hands like Hillary Hillary take our guns you know none of
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:24.200]  them had any normal facial expressions they didn't have any unique thoughts you
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:27.600]  know they were just like well like Hillary yeah that's a good idea it's a
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:30.840]  great thing no it's not if you actually look at the facts and you see what's
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:34.400]  going on no it's not look at these places that they're in control of and see
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.960]  how that's working out for them the same thing that happened when we were when we
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:41.000]  went to UT for the gun free UT you tried to talk to some of those people and
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.360]  none of them wanted to talk to you and I think this is a good thing that all
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:46.760]  these people need to pay attention to is that this is what happens in a society
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:50.240]  where guns are taken away and yet people will argue and say that well it's not an
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:53.920]  outright gun ban in Chicago but there are no gun stores in Chicago you can't
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:57.440]  purchase a gun unless illegally purchasing a gun right outside of the
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:00.200]  state where there aren't strict or gun laws I think people should pay attention
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:04.120]  to that stuff like this this black side where 7,000 people have been
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:07.520]  disappeared numerous people have been killed secretly and the people we talked
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:09.960]  to on the street they were aware of it some of them were aware of it and the
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:12.960]  ones that were it was the people that you would think lived in south side
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:15.960]  Chicago that were in the city for the day when we did the man on the street they
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:19.080]  were aware of the of the situation but most people out there had no idea and
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:23.600]  a lot of them didn't care but those are the people that go around saying we need
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:28.120]  stricter gun laws because people need to be kept safe well it's obvious that it
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:31.720]  doesn't keep people safe it allows criminals to flourish and that's what's
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.560]  happening there well when you make drugs illegal you create more criminals you
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:38.720]  create this drug trade that goes on and they have to try to figure out ways to
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:41.760]  get the drugs then when you make the guns illegal what happens if you're a law
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:45.600]  about a citizen and you want to have a gun driving through if you live in south
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:49.040]  side Chicago and you get pulled over by a cop and you've got a gun you're now a
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:53.920]  criminal yeah there's no way I'd live in areas like you said one area Chicago
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:56.880]  there's almost no crime it's really nice drive two miles you're in a hell hole
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:00.440]  the worst in the world highest crime rate in the world's south side there's no
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:03.840]  way I'd live there and I'll have a gun and how come the cops drive around they
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:07.160]  have guns and know that but then they don't want us to have guns well the
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:11.240]  average cop actually in Chicago is not actually for gun control and I don't want
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:14.720]  to make this just about bashing police because George Soros and others are
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:18.080]  projecting all the problems of the world on a police in general using bad
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:23.200]  examples this is the feds this is the globalist with a CIA substation we know
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:28.200]  the Justice Department's involved testing setting up these threat fusion
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:32.960]  centers to secretly interrogate to hold people for days to torture them and it's
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:37.480]  being beta tested for the Patriots you can believe it so after they've set the
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:41.520]  precedent of this I'll guarantee you they've got similar facilities around the
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:45.000]  country in fact I know they do there's just we don't have as much intel from
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.920]  inside of them this one is so blatantly out on the open well the big
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:51.600]  psychological operation behind this is like I said they're taking what they
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:54.480]  use and get mowing overseas and they're bringing it here to the home front and
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:57.800]  now they're using and they're also using this and they're looking at they sit back
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:01.640]  in the guy it's out in the public now people are starting to know about it now
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:04.800]  they watch the media and they go does anybody even care no one's even making a
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:10.160]  fuss about it the Guardian us that's it there should be so many people every you
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.760]  should be able to turn on Fox CNN MSNBC ABC CBS and everyone should be talking
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:19.680]  about this place but no one is because nobody cares that's part of that
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:24.000]  psychological operation they're sitting back going hmm well they know we're
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  doing this 7,000 people we've disappeared here numerous we forced drugs on we've
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.880]  killed them no one cares I guess we could do whatever the hell we want all
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:38.400]  right let's open up another one that's the Psyop the fact that no one cares and
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.440]  that they have pushed it out there for everyone to see well that's it what's
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:47.360]  coming next I mean now banks are grabbing people's private bank accounts
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:50.760]  that's after tax money and just saying it's ours because they're putting
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:55.800]  Goldman Sachs heads like Peter Sutherland over the EU I mean they're
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:58.520]  already just taking people's money they're already announcing they're
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:01.200]  gonna do it here they're announcing they're getting rid of cash so that they
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:06.840]  can tax us for every transaction we make I mean the complacency is building a
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:11.200]  hellish world I mean what happens when they take the guns and one of the people
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:16.880]  who are anti-gunners gets robbed jack shot what are they gonna say then take
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:19.600]  what you already took the guns obviously criminals are gonna get them anywhere
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.640]  they want to that's why the criminals they don't care these people are gonna go
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:26.560]  well if I only had a way to defend myself I told you the story in college I
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:30.120]  kept my guns at my parents and their guns safe in their big closet and I was
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:33.360]  going to shoot and range your deer hunting I don't remember and I was
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:37.560]  walking out with a rifle and a handgun and the rifle was out the handgun was in
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:41.880]  a case and my dad's buddy from college who's a major newspaper editor major
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:47.120]  newspaper editor has moved around but he's been different newspapers saw the
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:50.280]  rifle and out of the living room I mean we're talking through a dining room into
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:54.920]  a living room we're talking 50 feet away went like a woman I've known this
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:59.520]  guy all my life into the beach with them vacations you know and I said I said
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:04.440]  Chris what's the big deal it's just a rifle my dad's like yeah let him show
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:08.600]  it to you I go it's on it's not loaded it's take a load he's like please got her
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:13.280]  why kick him was a giant cobra but if he sees a cop with a gun he doesn't go
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:19.080]  into that fear these people I'm telling you are not in the real world well they
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:22.760]  just I mean they would think somebody like I said earlier pulling a rabbit
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:25.560]  out you know and killing it cooking it for dinner you know that they'll call
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:29.400]  animal cruelty on you not knowing that's a lot less cruel than putting it
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:33.200]  through a major processing facility they just they're disconnected from normal
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:36.000]  human activity they've been engineered that way stay there I want to talk more

[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:19.520]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:22.960]  alex jones
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:34.520]  remember just six months ago 40 plus mexican college students criticized the
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:39.240]  mayor and they just disappeared heard out they've been murdered this happens
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:42.880]  all over the world this is a formulae this is a program that we're
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:47.720]  incrementally being marched into that's being beta tested it's like the
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:52.040]  military admits and they're good people they're blowing the whistle you know just
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:56.840]  like my dad's cousin you know didn't like what was going on and got out of it
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:00.960]  but at the same time the public's then so ignorant they don't realize what's
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:05.280]  happening how do you reach out to a public that's so politically illiterate
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:11.080]  Josh Jones well I think that some at some point you have to start a dialogue
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:14.200]  and you have to make people open to listen to what you have to say like we
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:18.080]  did when we were in Chicago the thing is is that there were a few there were a
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:21.600]  few outlets that were putting out the information that there was a black site
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:25.840]  but even while we were there the local papers were saying that it wasn't true
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:29.720]  that it wasn't a CIA black site that it wasn't going on there and that nothing
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:32.320]  was happening which is what they do every single and then we talked to the
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:34.600]  local students said why do you think that they're doing that he says well
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:38.560]  because the Chicago PD is like a bunch of thugs he's like those guys are gonna
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.880]  go in and threaten those guys and say hey if you don't write that or if you
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:46.520]  write what's really going on we're gonna come after you like you said it is like
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:50.120]  gangland style there they off-handedly threatened us when we went outside the
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:54.120]  building and the guy drove outside in public it wasn't a private area so don't
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:57.960]  film me he said don't feel me you'll get me killed in a bank parking lot now he
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:02.640]  he didn't we didn't just accidentally like pan over to him Josh is filming me
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.800]  right here this guy drives out of his way off the main road to come in the
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:12.720]  video lot into this parking lot just to say that by him being on film that we
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:15.720]  could get him killed well and and that is a horrible job they've got and they
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:18.360]  believe because they watch these cop shows I watch these cop shows they have
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:23.040]  this one Chicago detective I forget the name of it I saw it on a flight back from
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:27.320]  England and they literally just break the law and torture everybody but it's
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:32.360]  always for a good cause in the end well that's not how the world really works
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:36.880]  and what they're doing is just like they tried to turn my dad's quote uncle or
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:40.880]  really his cousin call him an uncle he's like ten years older just like they
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:44.040]  tried to turn him into one of these guys and he wouldn't do it once it got
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:47.840]  really bad you mean he was a real patriot they're finding cops that'll do it
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.760]  and man I guarantee you these cops have got government badges that they're
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:55.440]  getting government federal pay I guarantee you they have no idea long
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:58.000]  term what they're involved in they're supposedly supposed to be going after
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.160]  heroin and things like that it's supposed to be a big area where they
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:06.040]  hold people who are involved with you know drug dealing all of that and what
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:09.000]  is heroin it's a drug that's very addictive you know what else is addictive
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.800]  power when you take cops like this and you put them in a black site where
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:17.960]  there's basically no law they can do whatever they want maybe at the beginning
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:22.200]  it is used to go after super bad guys and they feel like they're doing the
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:26.200]  right thing but eventually it's like shooting a drug into your veins that
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:31.160]  power becomes a dick that's it and take cartel Ian the police had secret torture
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:35.840]  sites there and it looked just like this one it's an empowering thing to know
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:38.840]  that you can be in control of another human being and make them do whatever you
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:43.120]  want and these people get put in positions they feel like gods it's
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:46.920]  disgusting it's a ritualistic type deal where they they take these people and
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:50.320]  they've gone from doing the right thing so to say and trying to take these bad
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:53.520]  you know hardened criminals off the streets to now they're just picking
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:58.040]  people up because they need another fix they need to see that fear and another
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:02.320]  human beings eyes that's what really gets them going makes their heartbeat makes
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:05.560]  them feel like I talked about earlier that's called being a psychotic but
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:08.680]  that's what's happening when you when you take that lawless in a way when you
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:11.720]  take that law away and you don't hold people accountable in a position like
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:15.600]  that it's easy to go over to the dark side well especially when the commanders
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:22.400]  were at black sites at Guantanamo in Iraq when the head guys there as you
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:26.240]  documented it were hired out of federal operations well another thing that they
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:29.160]  they know they can get away with it too for a long time because a bottom floor I
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:32.320]  can't even see where's a picture the bottom floor is an area where people go
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:35.960]  in to pick up stuff they get arrested the cops take a cell phone or a gun or
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:38.720]  whatever that's where they go and they can pick up their belongings that first
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:42.480]  floor so people go in there all the time they hold press conferences so it
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:45.760]  always just seemed like a normal place for operations were going on instead
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:50.880]  second third fourth fifth floor up people are being tortured beaten stomped on
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:56.520]  meanwhile behind this innocent-looking bookstore the torture is going on
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:58.600]  incredible thank you gentlemen
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.680]  Kit Daniels infoworse.com
[02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:04.080]  Hillary Clinton said repealing the second amendment is worth considering
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:07.640]  the presidential candidate attacked the second amendment during an October 16th
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:11.640]  town hall meeting and what she said we should consider a nationwide gun ban in
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:15.640]  a buy-back program to eradicate private gun ownership she said that America
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:19.960]  should practically outlaw guns just like Australia Canada in the UK but she
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:23.080]  failed to mention that she supported shipping guns to Syrian rebels the
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:26.640]  majority of whom are either ISIS militants are affiliated with the Islamic
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:30.120]  state senator Rand Paul even said she was the biggest cheerleader for
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:34.800]  distributing guns to these rebels linked to not only ISIS but also al-Qaeda and
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:38.000]  the al-Nusra front time and time again journalists have interviewed the
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.920]  rebels of Syria and almost all of them admitted they have pledged allegiance
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:44.160]  to these radical Islamic groups according to journals been rentals
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:47.320]  there's simply no real separation between moderate rebel groups and
[02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:51.400]  hardline Salafist allied with al-Qaeda so in other words Hillary thinks that the
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:55.240]  second amendment only applies to al-Qaeda and ISIS once again this is Kit Daniels

[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:39.520]  the film is the forecaster and Martin Armstrong of course has Armstrong
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:47.360]  economics.com he is a former political president he began his studies into
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:51.440]  market behavior when he first became fascinated by the events during the
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:56.560]  crash of 66 he became one of the very first to begin forecasting currencies
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:01.240]  he began creating a global model in the mid 70s and was published the results
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:06.720]  about 72 by 85 Armstrong certainly one of the top premier foreign exchange
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:10.080]  analysts in the world and he was cited in the Wall Street Journal you name it
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:15.440]  Armstrong is the developer of economic confidence model based on business
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:20.840]  cycles and then it goes over all of that in the different predictions he made
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:25.040]  about different crashes and the different tops of markets and things like
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:30.720]  that and I wanted to get him on to speak about what was currently happening in
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:35.840]  the world the move by big banks to get rid of cash what he sees with China
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:43.040]  moving to start dumping so-called US treasuries and the fact that what is
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:48.520]  illegal and was denied until a few years ago is now admitted that worldwide
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:53.760]  currency rates are being rigged by insiders that worldwide stock markets
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:57.760]  are being rigged that interest rates libor is only part of it are being rigged
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:03.200]  and that only a select few get to act on that insider trading knowledge if they
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:08.560]  catch a low-level person acting on insider trading say you work at a company
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:11.480]  you know a mergers coming in two months you think that mergers probably gonna
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:17.800]  lower the price of the stock you go ahead and sell it well that's just common
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:21.320]  sense what somebody do but no that's in center trading we're gonna put you in
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:26.040]  prison for that for $5,000 $20,000 we'll put Martha Stewart in for a couple
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:32.040]  hundred thousand dollars but then the big boys do it every day so there's so
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:36.320]  many places to go with Armstrong Martin Armstrong he was on before loved
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:40.560]  having as a guest really informed fellow I could ask a lot of questions here Mr.
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:45.480]  Armstrong but where do you think we should start with this whole cornucopia of
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:48.920]  craziness happening I mean am I wrong in saying do you agree that we're really
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:53.840]  entering a more volatile time where things are compacted and we're about to
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:11:01.160]  see a lot of economic and political and military action yeah the next four years
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:07.280]  is basically really gonna be pretty bad it's all coming to a head at this stage
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:13.400]  in the game and the biggest problem people don't realize is that it is
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:19.200]  it's really debt driven and what that means is that if you look at the national
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:26.480]  debts 70% of it is accumulative interest so you know it didn't even create a
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:31.600]  socialist agenda you know helping people or anything of the nature although
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:37.000]  that's the greatest you know sales pitch that they always say but it you know
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:43.840]  when you look at it it the money is going out the back door and so the debt
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:48.680]  crisis is really driving everything because governments know that they're
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:53.920]  starting to lose power and as they lose power then you're you're looking at this
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:12:00.760]  eliminating you know cash all this basically designed to get more taxes
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:05.480]  you know rather than reform the system and say hey you know something's really
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:13.160]  screwed up here now they just try to hold on to it and I mean the the media
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:18.920]  doesn't really tell the truth about much of anything I really laugh when you see
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:22.960]  Hillary Clinton trying to pretend she's really for the poor and all this sort of
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:28.160]  stuff and then she goes rents a house on the beach for 150 grand but for two
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:35.160]  weeks no less but it was the Clintons then that started this mess they repealed
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:42.120]  glass seal and allowed the banks to start proprietary trading and that really
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:49.280]  profoundly changed the banking system it's created transactional banking it's
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:54.680]  not what a lot of people you know think I just trade money back and forth to each
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:13:03.000]  other and charge each other fees yeah I mean it's basically before banks would
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.360]  what they would do is you know if I was a banker I would lend you money for your
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:12.240]  start of business but I would you know there was a relationship I would come
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:18.360]  down make sure you're doing okay etc when Clinton repealed Glass Eagle the
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:24.320]  argument to do so was that if they could start trading then that would make the
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:30.360]  banking system more secure because they wouldn't risk if there was an economic
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:36.520]  decline or failures etc so what they did with the 07 and the seat you know and
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:41.320]  the mortgage backed securities they started packaging this stuff and then
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:49.000]  reselling it so it became transactional banking rather than relationship so I
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:53.840]  no longer care really what happens to you as long as it looks good on paper hey
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:58.080]  and I got somebody else will buy it I'll lend you money and I sell to somebody
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:05.480]  else if you default that's their problem so we were in this period of of really
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:12.320]  where the banks are no longer what they used to be and it's really causing a
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:17.320]  tremendous problem the second thing that that the Clintons did was
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:23.880]  effectively you know he stood up and said oh well okay they signed in the you
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:29.440]  know the Education Act and they're gonna make it more affordable so they said
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:33.680]  they were lower interest rates for students but what they didn't tell you
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:38.680]  was that they you know at the back door again what they do with the bankers they
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:43.240]  cut a deal and they made that students cannot even get rid of the what they all
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.200]  went on in bankruptcy I mean you can go bankrupt though just about everything
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:55.080]  but through loans so it's having a major impact in the sense that you're saying
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:15:00.520]  marriages are declining dramatically because kids can't afford to really get
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:07.400]  married and you know with a high debt from student loans they came to get a
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:14.360]  mortgage so it's really it's it's having a real serious impact across the board
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:20.480]  and well you look at the United Nations sure when you look at the United
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.720]  Nations and you look at june 21 and the post growth period and the plan to
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:31.080]  reduce savings so that people are too poor to have children there really is a
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:35.480]  method of the madness and the establishment of course basically exempts
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:40.200]  themselves from what they're foisting on the American people and you're right
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:44.560]  watching Hillary Clinton just in a clip I played earlier say that they should
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:49.480]  ban basically all the guns and confiscate them like Australia she goes on to
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:55.680]  say how she's fighting the big banks too big to fail and the mortgages and
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:00.760]  everything when she was there with her husband and Larry Summers and all the
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:07.320]  rest of the folks who literally did this as you were just saying put all this in
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:12.280]  place so they could have unlimited free money themselves and then give us
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:18.400]  basically the debt it's it's just so crazy to watch the bipartisan elites do
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:22.080]  this I don't see how they think they're ever gonna get away with this I mean
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:26.600]  what a plan they've developed you've been pretty accurate at predicting not
[02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:30.520]  just economic moves but social moves there's two different articles today one
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:35.040]  of the New York Post one in RT saying America's due for a revolution do you
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:38.680]  think they've bit off more than they can chew because they've expanded
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:45.360]  derivatives as you know since 2008 they have really consolidated the economy
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:52.560]  and then the ultra rich have the the gall to then push social change movements
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:57.760]  that push class envy to try to start some weird wealth redistribution move
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.640]  from the middle class to poor so a type of bait and switch where do you see all
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:09.440]  this going it's you know effectively you know the whole system is just really
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:15.440]  collapsing because of debt and that's really what is driving everything they
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:22.720]  can't sustain this so I don't see it you know lasting very much longer I mean I
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:30.680]  you know we have offices in Beijing and Abu Dhabi and around Europe etc and I
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:35.600]  travel over the place I was just in Greece for the for their last elections
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:43.200]  everywhere I go people are very angry at career politicians that's really what's
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:49.320]  coming down so I see this as a worldwide you know problem and a trend and
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:56.120]  you're seeing it more in right now as they feel the pain first and eventually
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:00.080]  you will come here where you're seeing it in Japan and Japan they call it the
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:06.240]  celibacy syndrome the kids aren't even dating no less getting married and in
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:12.440]  Canada you had the finance minister he came out and actually said that well
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:17.200]  they they should work for free just to get experience while they're living in
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:22.320]  their basement of their parents I mean this is a joke I mean in Europe you
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:27.680]  have unemployment among the youth about 60% they call it the lost generation so
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:34.040]  we're heading towards major civil unrest and this is what revolution is
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:41.560]  really about it comes around about right on a cycle about every 300 years and you
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:47.720]  know we asked for it I think honestly because we're too complacent we just
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:51.920]  allow the politicians to do whatever they want we believe whatever they say
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:19:00.880]  and you know the media just honestly it just gets to be really ridiculous I mean
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:05.560]  even if you look at my my case in the movie they put a little clip on there
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:11.480]  from Bloomberg News when they were trying to do it everybody said gee you know
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:16.160]  that I was over the press I've been erased you go to Bloomberg terminals I
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:22.600]  don't show up but we used to publish on there so it's really kind of a joke that
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:28.040]  that the producers of the film couldn't find anything and they finally found that
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:33.520]  clip on a way back machine and then they went to Bloomberg and said hey well we
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:38.000]  found something you said doesn't exist and so they had to allow them to put it
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.240]  in the movie but it's it you know Bretton
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:45.720]  Morgensen will be on the front page of the New York Times and what's going on
[02:19:45.720 --> 02:19:52.280]  what's going on here absolutely Martin Armstrong a man put into the memory

[02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:14.600]  coming up in the next segment this headline just went up on info wars.com
[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:19.200]  Russians threatened to shoot down Israeli aircraft Israelis allegedly attempt
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:23.720]  to spy on Russian ships and aircraft in Syria allegedly it's all admitted
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:27.480]  everybody spies on each other an Arab language news network and Iran reports
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:32.120]  Russian fighter jets intercepted Israeli aircraft on an espionage mission near
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:39.560]  the Syrian border Sunday Al Alam quote of the Israeli daily is saying the
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:44.040]  Russians forced the Israeli aircraft to change course after they were detected
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:49.160]  with radar the Russians blocked Israeli aircraft while flying over the Akhar
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:53.960]  region of northern Lebanon and sent a warning they would open fire they
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:58.600]  violated the Syrian airspace well we know that's been happening with US aircraft
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:02.560]  as well it's really sad to see our government on the side of the jihadis
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:07.680]  over there I'm out lionizing Russia as I've said a thousand times probably but
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:12.800]  Russia's defending its national interest we are there destroying our national
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:18.360]  interest we've got to Armstrong economics head Martin Armstrong on famous
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:24.480]  predictor of trends they made a major film about him and the response of the
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:30.320]  establishment was he didn't exist of course the film gets into all that just
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:34.440]  amazing the type of stuff that they pull so they were able to interview a lot of
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:39.480]  the big Wall Street heavies about what had happened let's get back to your film
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:43.440]  in your case because that's a window into all this is a short segment long
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:46.400]  segment coming up we get into the world economy and where you see it going but
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:50.680]  for folks that don't know it's important for them to know what happened to you in
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:26:02.640]  a nutshell well effectively I I don't entirely know because our computer does
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:11.120]  oh it's a it's monitoring the entire world on a capital flow basis and it has
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:17.520]  done amazing forecasting as far as war is concerned I didn't quite understand it
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:26.440]  at first but we had the Lebanese Universal Bank of Lebanon had found a
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:31.800]  journal in their basement with the Lebanese pound back to the mid-1800s so
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:36.040]  they asked us if we could create a model I said sure you know we put it in and
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:40.320]  what it does it correlates absolutely that market with everything in the world
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:46.720]  and it came back and it said that you know their currency was going to collapse
[02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:52.800]  in eight days which I was very shocked and I called a client but the clients
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:59.280]  paid me to for what does the computer say now what I say so I told them I said
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:04.880]  you know the says you got eight days and the client said to me says okay what
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:09.720]  currency do you think is best which I thought was really shocking because I
[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:15.160]  thought I just delivered a major forecast which I thought was nuts and then I
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:21.560]  saw it did the same thing eight days later the Lebanese war began then it did
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:28.680]  the same thing with Iran Iraq war and then finally I began to understand you
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:36.400]  know watching it for about 20 years so well we saw 150 you know a billion
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:40.640]  coming out of Russia with only a hundred billion going in we stood up in you
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:44.920]  know in at our London conference and said Russia's going to collapse and you
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:50.200]  got about 30 days and I didn't realize but the London Financial Times somebody
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:55.560]  was there at in that conference and they put it on the front page so when
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:59.400]  Russia collapsed that created long-term capital management and all that sort of
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:06.640]  stuff so that's when the CIA called us and said hey you know okay fine we have
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:11.960]  to have this model and and I told them look we'll run it any study you want no
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:17.520]  problem but then they said no we have to own it and I said well you know forget
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:27.680]  it I'm not gonna so that existed but at the same time it was largely the banks
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:35.840]  that were really trading in our account exactly the same as MF global and they
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:42.080]  were using segregated accounts to play the stock market pretty much I mean what
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:47.600]  they do is they play it at one against the other the rules in the states do not
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:53.680]  require a bank to tell you they're taking your money and they sell it over and
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:58.720]  they sell it in London in London they have to have a signature of a client so
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:06.800]  what happens it's the US branch as a an account with the London branch and then
[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:10.960]  so to meet the law over there they said well did the client agree they said yes
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:16.480]  the US branch agreed so you have no idea going on and what they were actually
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:22.520]  doing I understood the system so I was buying Fannie Mae's and which are not
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:29.120]  you can't post it repo so I knew what they couldn't put today they started
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:37.520]  selling them but not putting the entries in our accounts and so that's a technical
[02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:40.960]  stay there because your skype's breaking up a bit that's technical so I want
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:45.000]  people to understand exactly what you're getting at we'll be a right back ladies

[02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:03.560]  kid Daniels info wars calm did you know that since 1960 the number of married
[02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:08.160]  adults has decreased from 72% down to 51 in other words barely half of all
[02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:12.240]  adults in the US are married which is a record low case in point a Catholic
[02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:15.520]  pastor recently revealed he's only performing five marriages a year down
[02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:19.560]  from 35 over 25 years ago in the pastor Charles Pope said other priests have had
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:22.800]  similar experiences but why are men shine away from marriage and even
[02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:26.160]  relationships with women in general well pastor Pope pointed out the obvious
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:30.160]  radical feminism is destroying marriage by driving a wedge between men and women
[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:33.520]  for one thing thanks to feminism many men are now so terrified of being labeled
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:37.200]  rapist that they shy away from showing any interest towards women even women who
[02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:41.160]  hate feminism and because of that many women now complain they cannot find real
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:44.400]  men who have the confidence to approach them there's a video report on info

[02:32:30.120 --> 02:32:50.120]  They're forced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:32:50.120 --> 02:33:00.120]  Thank you for watching InfowarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfowarsLife.
[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:34.120]  Get down, can't afford electricity. Nobody's got a dime in Detroit, broke city. We got two. Get up, get to you home. It's time to leave. Get down, can't afford electricity.
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:52.120]  Here's our guest, famous economist, famous analyst, the documentary, a major film shows him on the news, him in the newspapers predicting things that happened. The feds then came and grabbed him and took him to jail.
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:34:06.120]  It's pretty amazing when you see this type of persecution going on and I think from my research, he can correct me if I'm wrong, he was starting to get to that, he could see their market manipulation and basically start telling clients how to trade off of watching them manipulate.
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:15.120]  Now you have flash trading, high frequency trading, the plunge protection team, the president's open market committee.
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:30.120]  We've gone from a point where it was a conspiracy theory to say you could see manipulation of the gold market or the oil market or the interest rates and now that's all admitted but they kind of just hide it in plain view and nobody gets in trouble
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:50.120]  because the big guys are allowed to do this as they consolidate the economy in a crony system while developing a police state to suppress the population when the whole thing goes belly up. I guess they'll have theirs and the rest of us will be out in the cold in a road warrior scenario.
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:35:14.120]  Martin you were getting into why they got upset with you as best you know, finish up with that and then where do you, I mean we talked about this but clearly they know where this is all going and clearly they're trying to have a rear guard action of social engineering, divide and conquer police state but I don't really see that working.
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:33.120]  No, I mean, I think that the, in my case, it was exactly like, like MF global, they were, like I said, I was, we were buying Fannie Mae's rather than T-bills because Fannie Mae's you could not resell or for the night in repo in London.
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:53.120]  So they were just selling our Fannie Mae's and not putting entries in our accounts and then using the cash and they just get away with this stuff. It's just amazing but what it is is that the bankers are the prime, you know, the major banks are the primary dealers.
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:36:09.120]  They always get bailed out by threatening the government and saying, listen, if you take us down then who's going to sell your debt. So that's, that's been the hook that constantly goes back and forth and but I believe this is really coming to a head.
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:24.120]  That's what our computers been showing. This is just, it's getting to the point of a major, major crisis. We are at interest rates now we're at 5,000 year lows and it's just not sustainable.
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:41.120]  The quantitative easing has been really a mess in the sense that the banks bought in, you know, the Fed bought in 30 year bonds and to try and help the mortgage market. Well, the problem is they're not going to be able to resell them now.
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:46.120]  So it's, they're the central banks are getting trapped.
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:51.120]  To be clear, the central banks are buying their own treasury bonds.
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:55.120]  Well, they bought the, it's not their bonds, it's the government's bonds.
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:37:00.120]  But still the central banks, even though they're quasi-private, it's one of the same as my point.
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:11.120]  Yeah, on the balance sheet, they're, you know, they are separate, but they're buying the Fed, the federal government, the treasury.
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:22.120]  Sure. So how long can all of that crud sit in the fandom zone before it bubbles up to the surface? Or could this new magical made up economy go on forever?
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:31.120]  No, I honestly, I don't think it's going to last beyond probably March of next year. You're going to start seeing it going a little bit nuts.
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:43.120]  Europe is already, it's far worse there than here, mainly because of the design of the euro has been a complete disaster.
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:49.120]  And people don't, in the States, they tend to look at the dollar and don't understand why it's so strong.
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:53.120]  But honestly, if you look around the world, there's no place to put money.
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:38:08.120]  The euro could never compete with the dollar because they didn't have a single debt. You had, if you wanted to buy European bonds, you had to look at each individual country the same way you would have to buy state bonds here.
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:17.120]  And in theory, they thought all interest rates would be the same. And I told them when they came to us in 98, I told them this was going to fail.
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:31.120]  And you can't design a currency like this. And they said they understood that they just wanted to get the currency through first and then they would take care of the debt, but they never did.
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:42.120]  So each bank in Europe is far worse than the United States because banks reserves are basically the government debt.
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:55.120]  Well, I totally agree with you. So let me ask you this question. How do you see the dominoes falling? Because if the private big banks have got so much free money because they have the first use of this interest free money that they don't even want cash anymore.
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:39:04.120]  They don't even want deposits anymore. Effectively, with banking laws, as you know, they're getting rid of real banks that loan money to small businesses.
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:17.120]  Here's the Wall Street Journal, big banks to America's firms. We don't want your cash. I mean, there's got to be a method of this madness here. They've sure taken over. They've sure consolidated power.
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:24.120]  Well, you know, the Fed was very nice and said, okay, we're going to do quantitative easing.
[02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:36.120]  It sounds like they're, you know, okay, they're going to expand the money supply by bringing in the bonds. They, in theory, would be injecting the cash into the system.
[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:47.120]  Then the banks said, well, we don't want to lend the money. So they created at the same time the excess reserve and the Fed pays the banks a quarter of a percent interest.
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:57.120]  There's over two and a half trillion dollars sitting there. So it never went into the economy. And the rest of it, you know, China, etc.
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:10.120]  Everybody's been selling the long term. Thank you very much. So the money did not, you know, it under the old way of thinking the Fed would buy bonds.
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:21.120]  And in theory, it would be an American selling it to them. So you were increasing the domestic money supply. But today is everybody's using the dollar globally.
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:30.120]  Sure. So it's musical chairs. People are going to the dollars. It's the best worst house on the block. How does it all end? When do you think it all starts to end?
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:43.120]  I honestly, it's going to start probably by March next year and go into 2017 and is going to get kind of really nuts. I know people look at U.S. debt and say, oh, it's 18 trillion.
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:54.120]  Take a look at the emerging markets. Since 2007, they issued $9 trillion a day. They owe half as much as the United States and they don't even have the economy.
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:41:05.120]  There's a bubble race. So no matter who loses the bubble race first, it affects everybody. So you think in the next two years, we'll see most of these bubbles starting to go down?
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:18.120]  Yeah, because this is why the Fed realizes it's in trouble. You know, Janet Yellen, and I'm glad I'm not her, she just really inherited a real nightmare.
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:28.120]  But what she keeps saying is that we have to normalize interest rates. The other side of the coin of this is that you have pension funds that are going bankrupt.
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:37.120]  Calpers, you know, they needed to make seven and a half percent. They came in at 2.4. You know, you have pension funds going bust.
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:49.120]  So if just the subprime crisis triggered 2008, could it be Chicago going under, Puerto Rico going under? Could it be the California retirement fund going under?
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:58.120]  There are literally more than 50 of these time bombs. The big union pensions, as you know, are just getting cut in half a bunch of them this week.
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:05.120]  I think the timers are starting to ding. I think this cake is pretty much done.
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:16.120]  Yeah, I mean, you know, they lowered the interest rates to help the banks, but in doing so, they didn't realize that they now created a pension crisis.
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:26.120]  And they can't get the rates up to help the pension funds. And you have your, you know, trying to do negative rates, still trying to help the banks.
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:38.120]  It's an absolute disaster. So, I mean, it's, you know, from what we're seeing, the dominoes start to go overseas.
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:48.120]  All right, Europe will probably be first. Then you're looking at, you're looking at Japan and emerging markets.
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:57.120]  You have Britain going to make a vote on exiting the EU. The polls right now are showing in favor of leaving.
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:03.120]  And I think once something like that begins, then the euro is going to absolutely tank.
[02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:08.120]  We're looking at the euro probably going to new historic lows under 80 cents.
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:14.120]  This is going to drive the dollar up as capital concentrates here.
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:21.120]  Eventually, you know, we'll go into tangible assets, but at first they're just buying dollars to park money.
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:29.120]  Is that going to cause inflation? It causes deflation first, which is what happened in the Great Depression.
[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:34.120]  And going into 1932, the dollar went to all time record highs.
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:40.120]  And that's what starts the protectionism because they say they can't sell it.
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:44.120]  Is there any inflation in Europe but not here in your view?
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:51.120]  Europe is eventually just really just, it's in a complete meltdown mode.
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:56.120]  And it's got the socialist committing suicide with the giant immigrant floods.
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:44:03.120]  I mean, I agree with you. I mean, Europe, disaster is not a strong enough word.
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:12.120]  You have, I was in Barcelona, they just voted to separate from Spain. I mean, I think Greece will end up breaking apart.
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:21.120]  You have Scotland trying to get out of the UK. You have UK basically going to probably vote to leave the euro.
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:32.120]  I mean, 40% of the youth in France don't want to be French anymore. I mean, it's a total mess everywhere I go over there.
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:39.120]  I agree with you. We got callers all over the map. Our guest Armstrong economics is Martin Armstrong, Armstrong economics.com.
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:45.120]  Really interesting fellow. I suggest you see the film. It's excellent. Let's talk to Sherri in Texas.
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:52.120]  We'll go to Eric, then we'll go to Drake, then we'll go to another Eric, a bunch of Eric's and Pete and others.
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:54.120]  Sherri, thanks for holding her on the air with our guest.
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:59.120]  Thank you, Alex. Yeah, I see something happening that's going to really hurt the middle class.
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:08.120]  And I want his opinion on this. I see two things going on. First of all, because we need a less costly workforce at this $15 an hour will work.
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:25.120]  If they put in a low workforce that is given welfare, is funded by welfare, mostly people coming in from other countries,
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:32.120]  they'll be provided with low cost housing, food stamps, Medicaid. It'll kind of be like a communist system, unemployment.
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:39.120]  Sherri, what we already have is where they bring in people who then have to have welfare as a supplement to their low wage. What's your specific question?
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:48.120]  The specific question is this will be $15 an hour. They'll be paying most of the $15 in for this low cost housing.
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:56.120]  They'll be taken care of. That leaves the middle class opting for small businesses.
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:46:06.120]  And this is the big warning. See what he thinks because like the students before them and like the housing, the homeowners before them and the farmers before them,
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:13.120]  these small businesses will be offered loans and it's like, don't take them.
[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:24.120]  Let me just take on what you're getting at there. What will the U.S. economy be like in your view and what would a increased minimum wage due to the economy?
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:32.120]  Basically, the minimum wage is largely for people trying to start. It's a lot of propaganda.
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:43.120]  And unfortunately, the more if you double the minimum wage, you're only going to make it more attractive for a lot of companies like McDonald's or whatever.
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:51.120]  I mean, here you walk into while while you just push the buttons and that's it. You go to a park your car. There's nobody there.
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:58.120]  I mean, at $15, you're going to replace a lot of menial jobs basically with computers.
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:06.120]  Well, already, as you know, the move Francis plan for their economy is to go all robot South Korea's plans to go all robot.
[02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:13.120]  Samsung says they have robots now better than humans. Fox comms replacing their labor with that in China.
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:20.120]  And this I mean, you know the article why the future doesn't need us. Where do you see all that going?
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:33.120]  Basically, it's, you know, these are major waves of innovation. And there, they are always linked to major depressions and things of this nature.
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:36.120]  The invention of the combustion engine.
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:44.120]  Put all the horse and buggies at this. All right. And so effectively, you have a problem with skilled labor.
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:54.120]  The people have to learn new skills to move to the next innovation. And, you know, they don't do that. And then that's what causes higher unemployment.
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:48:02.120]  Things of this nature. I get asked a lot. You know, gee, what I would I advise kids take programming.
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:12.120]  All right. It's if you understand how to program, then you can learn your whatever subject you're interested in if it's medicine or whatever.
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:16.120]  But learning how to program that is is like learning how to read or write.
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:22.120]  Absolutely. And they don't teach anybody that they teach them go get some social degree that's totally worthless.
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:28.120]  And young people have almost no communication skills. Now that's in the news today.
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:33.120]  And even Bloomberg admits that's the most valuable thing you can have is just social skills.
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:39.120]  People think you're pathetic if you say thank you and please. I mean, it's pretty scary.
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:51.120]  Well, you have Forbes magazine really showed that 60% of the kids that have a degree cannot find a job in whatever they have a degree in.
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:49:03.120]  It's really pretty bad. And the education system is basically an elite welfare state because they don't have to produce anything.
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:09.120]  All they have to do is effectively just take the money in and that's it.
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:14.120]  So they don't really care if you found the job or whatever.
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:22.120]  And a lot of them don't care either. They just want to act like they're innovating, act like they're part of a trendy socialist club, learn all the political correct terms and drool.
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:29.120]  Let's go ahead and take another call here. Let's go ahead and talk to Pete. We're going to break him back to Eric. Go ahead, Pete.
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:33.120]  Hello, Alex. It's Pete from Michigan. Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:37.120]  I got a quick question for your guests and also I have some information for you later on.
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:40.120]  You bet. We're not screening your call. You're on air. Go ahead and talk to the guest.
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:47.120]  Okay. To the guest, I have a question. You're talking about all this economic stuff and I have not heard at all.
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:55.120]  Oh, we cannot pay off the national debt because it's all based on this fiat currency. Nobody really pitches that.
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:50:01.120]  So don't you think it'd be a good idea to really promote that idea so that people can start to understand the real problem?
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:08.120]  That's a good point. I mean, look, we're told we can't get out of this debt. 18 trillion from what I've researched is nothing compared to the derivatives we've been signed on to.
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:10.120]  Is that correct, Mr. Armstrong?
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:16.120]  Well, forget the derivatives. I mean, worldwide debt is $160 trillion.
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:25.120]  So this system never, there's only one country that ever paid off its debt and that was Romania.
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:34.120]  And it created massive deflation and at that point in time, then they ended up in a revolution.
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:37.120]  So what do we do? Go ahead and just ride it off?
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:44.120]  Effectively, I think the only solution to this is a complete debt pre-sortering like you would do with a corporation.
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:46.120]  Sure. Stay there. Let's talk about it.
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:48.120]  We're not there to borrow money.
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:51:17.120]  Sure. Stay there. We've got to go to break. Pete, you're going to get your comeback and then we're going to go to Eric, Eric and Drake. Stay with us.
[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:31.120]  What happens with the formula heart and body extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:38.120]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:47.120]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics. So the body is an amazing thing. It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:15.120]  By the way, in the first hour I remembered that bizarre post-Piers Morgan interview where they had Buzz Bissinger and Ambassador, US Ambassador's daughter on,
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:28.120]  where they fantasized about killing me with guns because I want to own guns and they said, yeah, we'll dress up in uniforms and kill him and just really weird bizarre behavior.
[02:54:28.120 --> 02:54:37.120]  And now Salon, who has had a bunch of articles saying pedophilia is not a problem and saying pedophiles are people too.
[02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:45.120]  Yeah, and if I catch them touching my kids, I'm going to run an ice pick in their eye. How's that sound? Because ice picks, you know, are ice picks too.
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:53.120]  Salon, people who want guns should be shot first. Quote, if you love guns, if they make you feel safe, then you need to be shot.
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:58.120]  So we're going to add that Buzz Bissinger thing to the bottom of that video just to show what I was talking about.
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:04.120]  This weird thing where they talk about violence. And again, I'm not even what you call a conservative. I'm a libertarian.
[02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:11.120]  But I'd be a liberal if you, you know, called me somebody like Thomas Jefferson. These new people that call themselves liberals are not liberals.
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:16.120]  They're very weird. Pete in Michigan, you had one other point you wanted to make. Go ahead quickly place.
[02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:24.120]  Yeah, I just want to say your, your guess, there's not exactly clearing the field on anything. He's talking about declaring bankruptcy.
[02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:33.120]  Yeah, that's fine. But first we need a plan and then we need to declare the bankruptcy. But we need to get rid of the Federal Reserve Bank also where we're going to be right back in the same spot where we started.
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:39.120]  Well, I totally agree. The people that have maneuvered us into the situation need to be out of power, need to go back to an Americana system.
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:46.120]  Let me ask Mr. Armstrong this question. Just in a nutshell, what financial system would you call Americana?
[02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:50.120]  The system of Alexander Hamilton or some of the other systems?
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:56:00.120]  I mean, I would say just get back to Congress issuing the currency and get back to a system based on money supplied, based on population and based on economic growth.
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:03.120]  Go back to what we had pre Federal Reserve.
[02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:10.120]  Well, I think, you know, the, the issue that you have to understand is really have to dissect what the problem is.
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:17.120]  And some people think that if you go back to a gold standard, somehow that will, that will turn politicians into saints.
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:23.120]  We had a gold standard, you know, they, they fixed gold at $35, but they continued to print money.
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:33.120]  So, you know, a two year old would figure out that that is sustained. The problem isn't what is the money. The problem is the politicians.
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:39.120]  And, you know, historically for 6000 years are the ones that always cause the problem.
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:46.120]  Sure, look at third world countries. I mean, they're always over printing and getting into themselves up front. It's just standard procedure.
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:50.120]  Yeah. It's the politicians that are the real problem.
[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:59.120]  You know, what Jefferson spoke of, which she actually said institutions should should automatically expire every 19 years.
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:01.120]  Why?
[02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:10.120]  Because taxation with that representation is basically what he defined as a national debt.
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:20.120]  Because now the younger generation has to pay higher taxes to pay off this national debt for something that was back before they were even born.
[02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:29.120]  You shouldn't be able to saddle the next generation and we're now here. We're the next generation. Everybody living right now is about to get to come up and when all this comes through.
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:36.120]  Right. This taxation, this is what Jefferson's talked about that taxation without representation.
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:50.120]  So we're having to pay off this debt. I mean, I think that's the only solution, honestly, is there shouldn't be career politicians and we should not allow the federal government to even borrow money.
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:52.120]  Sure. It's illegal.
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:58:11.120]  And that's what you need. All right. And that's the real crux of the problem. And if you were to deal with that issue, then you would at least be able to sustain a system a little bit longer than perhaps historically what has taken place before.
[02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:25.120]  All right. We're going to do five more minutes and I promise I'm going to Eric in Colorado, Eric in Michigan, and at least Drake in California. We're going to come in with your questions, your comments and the final segment and then a whole other hour with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:37.120]  St. Louis has announced emergency plans for catastrophic nuclear event and more. And we've got Hillary saying they're coming up the guns. Leanne McAdoo, the Wonder Woman of the Airwaves in the fourth hour.
[02:58:37.120 --> 02:58:44.120]  Stay with us. We'll be back with one final segment with Martin Armstrong.
[02:58:44.120 --> 02:59:08.120]  70 seconds, folks. Stay with us.
[02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:18.120]  We'll be back with a full three. 888-253-3139.
[02:59:44.120 --> 03:00:11.120]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:00:11.120 --> 03:00:24.120]  Look, it comes down to this. We're sitting on top, total economic fantasy land. Those of us that produce, those of us that try to build a strong country, we're demonized because we can put two and two together.
[03:00:24.120 --> 03:00:36.120]  We need to get ready. We need to try to educate as many people as possible. We also need to be physically getting geared up and ready as well. Let's go to Eric in Colorado. You're on the air with Martin Armstrong. Go ahead.
[03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:41.120]  Hey, good evening, sir. How are you doing? Good. Go ahead.
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:47.120]  Hey, so I was just wondering if you guys caught last week's interview with Charles Koch.
[03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:51.120]  The liberal one that was running around? Yeah, I saw some of it.
[03:00:51.120 --> 03:01:07.120]  Yeah, where he pretty much came out on his vision of what kind of society makes people's lives better. And I quote for you, it is a society where people are too stupid and evil to run their own lives.
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:14.120]  But the people in power are more than capable of doing it because they are more intelligent.
[03:01:14.120 --> 03:01:23.120]  Yeah, and the Koch's fund, both sides of the political spectrum, the left likes to have this conspiracy theory that they run everything, but I mean, they're just part of the whole system.
[03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:34.120]  In my view, what is your view on the Koch brothers overall? And I did see that statement, statements about how the elite are virtuous and we're all stupid scum.
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:44.120]  Oh, I mean, it's absolutely true that they think that. And during the interview, I mean, just basically, if you watch a child, you can tell when a child is lying.
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:50.120]  And you can very clearly see where he is lying and some of the questions that Megyn Kelly ended up asking him.
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:56.120]  Sure. Let me jump to Martin Armstrong and get his tag. Thank you, Eric. Great point. Go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:02:06.120]  Now, look, I mean, the so-called elites, they're in trouble and they really do not know what's going on and they can't control it.
[03:02:06.120 --> 03:02:21.120]  This is basically totally out of control at this point. And it's taking down everybody and, you know, that idea that somehow that those in power know what's better for us.
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:32.120]  I mean, this is the taking place in Europe and you cannot elect any of the members of the Troiureka. None of them stand for election.
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:39.120]  All of them effectively are really just dictatorship. And that's what this leads to.
[03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:50.120]  That they know better than we do. So therefore, we don't even understand that we should be electing these people. So they just take power.
[03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:58.120]  I agree with you. Absolutely. Let's go ahead and go to Drake in California, then Eric and Michigan. Drake here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:03:01.120]  Hi. How are you doing? Good.
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:16.120]  I just wanted to bring up a, for some reason, I went back to Facebook for like all about two minutes and I just saw people from back home just over and over just scrolling and seeing people just bashing the Second Amendment.
[03:03:16.120 --> 03:03:28.120]  And one of the former teachers I used to teach with brought up this Michael Shea character from SNL, where he basically comes out and says, we need to get rid of the Second Amendment.
[03:03:28.120 --> 03:03:40.120]  And the Constitution was written by a bunch of crazy old people that also said you can own people as well. So it's just a discredited document.
[03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:50.120]  That's a, I mean, what you're just making a point about that this push to demonize gun owners for anything that somebody else does with a gun that's like blaming somebody that runs over someone for a car.
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:59.120]  So you blame other drivers for it. It's kind of like this weird collectivist guilt thing that you see in the totalitarian regimes. Martin Armstrong, you have any comments on that?
[03:03:59.120 --> 03:04:10.120]  The Second Amendment was largely there for one purpose, and that was basically to protect the people from government. That's really what it was about.
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:30.120]  And that there was a large view of maybe what they really wrote about at that point, Montesquieu, etc. was that what caused wars was the fact you had standing armies.
[03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:40.120]  And therefore the Second Amendment was to really place the arms in the hands of the people and that there would not be a standing army.
[03:04:40.120 --> 03:04:43.120]  That's right. Very quick, excellent answer.
[03:04:43.120 --> 03:04:52.120]  Well, you know your stuff. Martin Armstrong looking forward to having you back on ArmstrongEconomics.com. Read your analysis and find out more. Thank you so much.
[03:04:52.120 --> 03:04:54.120]  Oh, thank you for inviting me.
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:58.120]  You bet. Leanne McAdoo straight ahead for the next 55 minutes.
[03:04:58.120 --> 03:05:00.120]  Kit Daniels, infowars.com.
[03:05:00.120 --> 03:05:04.120]  Hillary Clinton said repealing the Second Amendment is worth considering.
[03:05:04.120 --> 03:05:14.120]  The presidential candidate attacked the Second Amendment during an October 16th town hall meeting in which she said we should consider a nationwide gun ban and a buyback program to eradicate private gun ownership.
[03:05:14.120 --> 03:05:19.120]  She said that America should practically outlaw guns just like Australia, Canada, and the UK.
[03:05:19.120 --> 03:05:27.120]  But she failed to mention that she supported shipping guns to Syrian rebels, the majority of whom are either ISIS militants or affiliated with the Islamic State.
[03:05:27.120 --> 03:05:36.120]  Senator Rand Paul even said she was the biggest cheerleader for distributing guns to these rebels linked to not only ISIS, but also al-Qaeda and the al-Nusra Front.
[03:05:36.120 --> 03:05:42.120]  Time and time again, journalists have interviewed the rebels in Syria and almost all of them admitted they have pledged allegiance to these radical Islamic groups.
[03:05:42.120 --> 03:05:49.120]  According to journalist Ben Reynolds, there's simply no real separation between moderate rebel groups and hardline Salafists allied with al-Qaeda.
[03:05:49.120 --> 03:05:54.120]  So in other words, Hillary thinks that the Second Amendment only applies to al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[03:05:54.120 --> 03:05:58.120]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with Infowars.com and keep checking back for more reports.
[03:06:24.120 --> 03:06:28.120]  3-888-253-3139
[03:06:55.120 --> 03:07:02.120]  Many of the products at InfowarsLife.com are true game changers.
[03:07:02.120 --> 03:07:06.120]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:07:06.120 --> 03:07:14.120]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nace and Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over 100 years.
[03:07:14.120 --> 03:07:24.120]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that Iodine accrued form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in Iodine was causing.
[03:07:24.120 --> 03:07:29.120]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves. What do you have to lose?
[03:07:29.120 --> 03:07:37.120]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:07:37.120 --> 03:07:41.120]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:07:41.120 --> 03:07:45.120]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:47.120]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[03:07:47.120 --> 03:07:53.120]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfowarsLife.com
[03:07:53.120 --> 03:08:15.120]  or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:23.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Shone Show. You are now entering the fourth hour overdrive and I am Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[03:08:23.120 --> 03:08:26.120]  Jakari Jackson will be joining me in studio coming up later on in the show.
[03:08:26.120 --> 03:08:29.120]  But we've definitely got a GM packed segment for you.
[03:08:29.120 --> 03:08:33.120]  I wanted to talk a little bit about what's going on in St. Louis, Missouri.
[03:08:33.120 --> 03:08:43.120]  Now I will be there next week covering potentially catastrophic nuclear event that they are finally warning their residents something big is going on there.
[03:08:43.120 --> 03:08:50.120]  But they've just released a disaster plan in case fire reaches a nuclear waste dump.
[03:08:50.120 --> 03:09:00.120]  It's a super fun site that was set up some years ago and there has been a fire burning underground for several years just about 1200 feet away.
[03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:07.120]  Now the AP reports beneath the surface of a St. Louis area landfill lurk two things that should never meet.
[03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:14.120]  A slow burning fire and a cache of Cold War era nuclear waste separated by no more than 1200 feet.
[03:09:14.120 --> 03:09:21.120]  Government officials have quietly adopted an emergency plan in case the smoldering embers ever reach the waste.
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:30.120]  It's a potentially catastrophic event that could send a plume of radioactive smoke over a densely populated area near the city's main airport.
[03:09:30.120 --> 03:09:39.120]  This fire has been burning in the bridge in landfill since about 2010, but they've just developed this worst case scenario plan last year sometime.
[03:09:39.120 --> 03:09:47.120]  But they just publicized it last week and they were saying, you know, worst case scenario, this could happen between three to six months.
[03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:50.120]  And so a lot of people have been really concerned about this.
[03:09:50.120 --> 03:09:58.120]  I actually wanted to go cover this last year, but of course a lot of other things happened in St. Louis that kind of took precedent there.
[03:09:58.120 --> 03:10:13.120]  The cause of the fire is unknown, but it's, you know, it's causing a lot of concern and it's actually creating such an awful smell that the attorney general actually sued Republic Services, which owns the landfill there.
[03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:30.120]  Now, the waste there, the nuclear waste was dumped there illegally by Mallon Crop Chemical Company, which is a facility that they were charged with creating the uranium processing for the Manhattan Project.
[03:10:30.120 --> 03:10:38.120]  So all of this, you know, this was back from the 1940s that they were working on, you know, the atomic bomb, all of this stuff.
[03:10:38.120 --> 03:10:45.120]  So then they just went ahead and illegally dumped it there, never thinking that there was going to be any urban sprawl and that people would be living there.
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:48.120]  I actually used to live quite close to this area.
[03:10:48.120 --> 03:10:58.120]  So I have a personal history with this Bridgeton landfill and all of that is causing huge concern to me because growing up, we were always told, don't ever go by that lake.
[03:10:58.120 --> 03:11:02.120]  There's the three-eyed fish that you see in the Simpsons and all of that.
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:10.120]  But there's a lot, St. Louis is kind of a cesspool for this secret testing and this nuclear waste.
[03:11:10.120 --> 03:11:24.120]  They actually have a pile of nuclear waste as a tourist attraction in Weldon Springs, Missouri, which is in St. Charles County, Missouri, which is just, you know, just right down the road from this other nuclear waste facility.
[03:11:24.120 --> 03:11:34.120]  And then the New York Times reports in 1990, mountain of nuclear waste splits St. Louis and the suburbs, yeah, you think.
[03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:36.120]  And that's exactly what the issue is.
[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:41.120]  For some time in St. Louis, there was a great divide between the haves and the have-nots.
[03:11:41.120 --> 03:11:49.120]  And so they just dumped all these nuclear testing facilities there, all this nuclear waste, a lot of secret testing.
[03:11:49.120 --> 03:11:56.120]  And this actually came out in 2012, secret Cold War tests in St. Louis raised concerns.
[03:11:56.120 --> 03:12:02.120]  Now, this is a social scientist there at the St. Louis Community College.
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:04.120]  Let me get her proper title, actually.
[03:12:04.120 --> 03:12:09.120]  She's a St. Louis Community College sociology professor, Lisa Martino-Taylor.
[03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:14.120]  And she's been doing a lot of research on this secret testing in the mid-1950s.
[03:12:14.120 --> 03:12:25.120]  And again, a decade later, the Army used motorized blowers atop a low-income housing high-rise at schools and from the backs of station wagons
[03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:34.120]  to send a potentially dangerous compound into the already hazy air in the predominantly black areas of St. Louis.
[03:12:34.120 --> 03:12:37.120]  And a lot of people that she interviewed, they remember this happening.
[03:12:37.120 --> 03:12:39.120]  They remember seeing the plumes of smoke.
[03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:45.120]  They remember seeing the station wagon blowing this dust out of the back just through these areas.
[03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:53.120]  Now, local officials were told at the time that the government was testing a smoke screen that could shield St. Louis from aerial observation
[03:12:53.120 --> 03:12:56.120]  in case the Russians attacked.
[03:12:56.120 --> 03:13:03.120]  It sort of sounds a lot like what they say the geoengineering is for, to shield us.
[03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:10.120]  They're just put that from any solar radiation or, you know, it's the same type of thing.
[03:13:10.120 --> 03:13:17.120]  So, but now in 1994, the government said the tests were part of a biological weapons program.
[03:13:17.120 --> 03:13:24.120]  And St. Louis was chosen because it bore some resemblance to Russian cities that the U.S. might attack.
[03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:30.120]  The material being sprayed was zinc cadmium sulfide, a fine fluorescent powder.
[03:13:30.120 --> 03:13:37.120]  And so over the years, since this has happened, this professor has interviewed these people.
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:45.120]  There's been a number, just record outbreak of breast, thyroid, skin cancer, uterine cancer, kidney and lung cancer,
[03:13:45.120 --> 03:13:53.120]  as well as three sets of conjoined twins right in the area that I told you about earlier where that lake is,
[03:13:53.120 --> 03:13:55.120]  that no one was ever supposed to go swimming in.
[03:13:55.120 --> 03:14:00.120]  These are all people that were somehow affiliated with the Malancrot Chemical Company,
[03:14:00.120 --> 03:14:04.120]  all of this secret testing there with the Army.
[03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:09.120]  And so I am going to be in St. Louis next week trying to get as many interviews as I can.
[03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:15.120]  I got a lot of documentation there from another whistleblower with Malancrot.
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:20.120]  So just really going to try and let everyone know how big of a deal this is.
[03:14:20.120 --> 03:14:26.120]  It's not just the fact that there is a potential nuclear fallout that could be happening there in St. Louis
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:29.120]  as if they haven't had enough trouble there in their community.
[03:14:29.120 --> 03:14:34.120]  But now I want to go ahead and play a report from John Bowne that gets into this even more.
[03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:51.120]  The government has been doing secret testing on the American people since at least the 1950s.
[03:14:51.120 --> 03:14:57.120]  The United States military produced a classified film in 1952 documenting covert operations
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:04.120]  for offensive biological and chemical warfare.
[03:15:27.120 --> 03:15:39.120]  On September 30, 2015, this film was finally declassified due to a FOIA request from GovernmentAddict.org.
[03:15:39.120 --> 03:15:44.120]  The U.S. Navy training film titled Naval Concepts of Biological and Chemical Warfare
[03:15:44.120 --> 03:15:50.120]  documents tests conducted on the western and eastern coastlines of the United States.
[03:15:50.120 --> 03:15:55.120]  Navy delivery and dispersion of the agents started with tests made in 1950.
[03:15:55.120 --> 03:16:01.120]  A rather crude spraying system was installed on a mine layer, which in September of that year
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:07.120]  secretly cruised off California and sprayed some 50 gallons of biological simulant
[03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:11.120]  along a track two to five miles offshore.
[03:16:11.120 --> 03:16:16.120]  Within an hour, the simulant had been carried ashore by the wind.
[03:16:16.120 --> 03:16:24.120]  Sampling tests indicated that about 48 square miles of heavily populated area were contaminated.
[03:16:24.120 --> 03:16:32.120]  Had an infectious agent been used in the spray, there might have been 210,000 casualties.
[03:16:32.120 --> 03:16:40.120]  With that experiment successful, the southeast coast of the United States was selected for a larger scale test.
[03:16:40.120 --> 03:16:46.120]  The rather flat terrain would be favorable to wide dispersion of wind-borne particles.
[03:16:46.120 --> 03:16:53.120]  It was determined that the track along here from five to 15 miles offshore should do the job.
[03:16:53.120 --> 03:17:00.120]  Interestingly, in April 1952, the USS Tercel cruised along some 100 miles of coastline
[03:17:00.120 --> 03:17:04.120]  spraying 250 pounds of fluorescent tracer particles.
[03:17:04.120 --> 03:17:07.120]  The operation lasted about eight hours.
[03:17:07.120 --> 03:17:12.120]  Sampling tests made throughout North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia
[03:17:12.120 --> 03:17:19.120]  indicated that an area of some 20,000 square miles received these particles.
[03:17:19.120 --> 03:17:24.120]  It was something that it is possible to contaminate extremely large land areas
[03:17:24.120 --> 03:17:28.120]  by releasing sprays at sea under the proper weather conditions.
[03:17:28.120 --> 03:17:32.120]  This dubious experiment known as Operation Seaspray
[03:17:32.120 --> 03:17:37.120]  resulted in 11 people being admitted to the hospital with severe urinary tract infections
[03:17:37.120 --> 03:17:42.120]  and the death of Edward Nevin, a man recovering from prostate surgery.
[03:17:42.120 --> 03:17:48.120]  The military never responded to the Stanford University Hospital doctors' investigation
[03:17:48.120 --> 03:17:55.120]  and the incident went down as the first recorded outbreak of seracea in the history of microbiology.
[03:17:55.120 --> 03:18:00.120]  The now declassified Navy film depicts the beginning of what would spiral into the military
[03:18:00.120 --> 03:18:08.120]  testing biological warfare at least 239 times in major cities up and down the coastline of the United States.
[03:18:08.120 --> 03:18:15.120]  The test went on as planned until in 1969 Richard Nixon issued an order to end the germ warfare operations
[03:18:15.120 --> 03:18:17.120]  and the stockpiling of biological agents.
[03:18:17.120 --> 03:18:22.120]  As a result of the horrors detailed at the Nuremberg trials following World War II,
[03:18:22.120 --> 03:18:24.120]  a Nuremberg code was established.
[03:18:24.120 --> 03:18:31.120]  The first point of that code being that required is the voluntary well-informed understanding consent
[03:18:31.120 --> 03:18:37.120]  of the human subject in a full and legal capacity as related to human experimentation.
[03:18:37.120 --> 03:18:43.120]  The U.S. military's covert operations broke that code secretly and almost immediately
[03:18:43.120 --> 03:18:46.120]  and did so to its own citizens no less.
[03:18:46.120 --> 03:18:52.120]  Is it any wonder that the chemtrails now blanketing our skies are being purposefully overlooked
[03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:58.120]  by a tyrannical government bent on soft killing its own citizens once again?
[03:18:58.120 --> 03:19:05.120]  Biological warfare? What do they expect me to do about it? It's not my headache.
[03:19:05.120 --> 03:19:10.120]  You're wrong. You had better find out the facts about biological warfare or BW.
[03:19:10.120 --> 03:19:21.120]  It can be aimed at you and your home or at work, at your food crops, your livestock.
[03:19:21.120 --> 03:19:30.120]  And so there you go. You'll recall last year Obama, John Kerry, they were trying to send us to war
[03:19:30.120 --> 03:19:35.120]  with Syria over these alleged chemical weapons testing by Assad on his own people.
[03:19:35.120 --> 03:19:40.120]  And now there's irrefutable evidence that chemical weapons have been tested right here in America
[03:19:40.120 --> 03:19:47.120]  on American people, not only by private companies but also by the U.S. government.
[03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:53.120]  So there you go. I'll stick around. We're going to be talking about Bernie Sanders' plan to raise taxes
[03:19:53.120 --> 03:20:06.120]  on the American family. U.S. safe.

[03:21:02.120 --> 03:21:07.120]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[03:21:07.120 --> 03:21:11.120]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:21:11.120 --> 03:21:14.120]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.

[03:21:18.120 --> 03:21:24.120]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[03:21:24.120 --> 03:21:29.120]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
