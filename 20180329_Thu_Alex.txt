[00:34.960 --> 00:39.360]  I have definitely reached total information overload I have never had more important news
[00:39.360 --> 00:45.840]  to cover and more of a jam packed broadcast coming up at the next segment we are going
[00:45.840 --> 00:51.360]  to kick off with Ted Nugent live via the phone and then later in the broadcast I'm
[00:51.360 --> 00:56.520]  going to air large excerpts of an hour and a half in depth amazing interview that we
[00:56.520 --> 01:04.800]  did a few weeks ago at his home in central Texas by Waco just amazing and it's so critical
[01:04.800 --> 01:10.480]  the things he talks about in this period of time we are all living in so Ted Nugent is
[01:10.480 --> 01:17.120]  going to be joining us to respond to the march to disarm the American people and the whole
[01:17.120 --> 01:23.560]  astroturf situation funded by Soros and the fact that it's blown up in their face and
[01:23.560 --> 01:28.840]  Ted Nugent privately told me that that was what they expected to happen when I was just
[01:28.840 --> 01:32.800]  there a few weeks ago and he talked about some of it publicly that maybe he will elaborate
[01:32.800 --> 01:37.240]  more on the whole kind of inside baseball of the NRA because here is the deal the left
[01:37.240 --> 01:41.880]  doesn't listen to us anyways I don't believe a word we say they are such idiots so Ted
[01:41.880 --> 01:47.480]  has been proven right Trump has been proven right that's coming up in the next segment
[01:47.480 --> 01:50.680]  we are going to go over all of it now talk about information overload here is the type
[01:50.680 --> 01:58.400]  of stories I've got a rest made in a Hollywood sex dungeon cult connected to the Clintons
[01:58.400 --> 02:05.320]  and more and it ties into Alistair Crowley rituals and it ties into the U.S. Senators
[02:05.320 --> 02:11.480]  and Vicente Fox's daughter I mean this just gets crazier and weirder these people are
[02:11.480 --> 02:19.600]  so whacked out I would never get sick of riding around a souped up golf cart with Labrador
[02:19.600 --> 02:23.640]  travers and shooting guns like Ted Nugent does I mean I never get sick of enchiladas
[02:23.640 --> 02:30.280]  and rock and roll and friends and family and you know hiking or get on the boat I just
[02:30.280 --> 02:34.040]  don't get what Hollywood like who goes let's go drink some blood and brand women and devil
[02:34.040 --> 02:40.640]  worship and let's bathe in blood and it's just like what's wrong with these people they're
[02:40.640 --> 02:46.160]  just they're scum and they're mentally ill and they're what we face so that's coming
[02:46.160 --> 02:53.360]  up also they caught this this this couple up in Boston with a bunch of weapons and hangar
[02:53.360 --> 03:00.440]  nades and they were government agents and that they call the police on themselves that
[03:00.440 --> 03:04.360]  looks like some type of false flag dry run right there ladies and gentlemen and because
[03:04.360 --> 03:07.520]  this was going on during the gun grabbing march in Boston and of course got the Boston

[03:27.720 --> 03:33.640]  Mohammed married a nine year old and so you can actually read the manual being put out
[03:33.640 --> 03:34.640]  nationwide.

[06:35.800 --> 06:44.040]  gear you name it with Ted Nugent and it's a perfect shot of Americana adrenaline into
[06:44.040 --> 06:54.320]  the veins of this nation Ted Nugent defined straight-edge Americana and he can be tracked
[06:54.320 --> 07:00.680]  back to being basically patient zero going back 40 plus years bringing the rebirth of
[07:00.680 --> 07:05.320]  the Republic back and I can tell you without Ted Nugent in the fight Trump wouldn't have
[07:05.320 --> 07:09.360]  been elected and the globalist would have already basically taken this country down
[07:09.360 --> 07:13.600]  and without Matt Grudge or without Donald Trump or without you but just it's important
[07:13.600 --> 07:17.720]  to single that out so a lot of you out there realize just how important and precious the
[07:17.720 --> 07:22.480]  patriots are that we have that have paid a lot monetarily their careers you name it
[07:22.480 --> 07:27.280]  being persecuted by Hollywood the entertainment system for not selling their nation out but
[07:27.280 --> 07:32.200]  you know what our founders gave up even more than that so I salute Ted Nugent he's just
[07:32.200 --> 07:36.520]  popping in before we go to this big interview that we're gonna exclusively air here today
[07:36.520 --> 07:41.600]  to give us the optics on what's currently happening and when I was at his house two and a half
[07:41.600 --> 07:47.440]  three weeks ago I said listen people are really concerned about Trump saying oh I want to
[07:47.440 --> 07:51.320]  hear you out what do you want it's all on the table to get them to say we want to ban
[07:51.320 --> 07:56.960]  your guns and he told me a little bit more off record said some on the record and I said
[07:56.960 --> 08:01.040]  well I'm gonna trust you and I'm gonna trust Trump because I know you're not a compromiser
[08:01.040 --> 08:06.480]  and well it's been proven right they got the Democrats to come out all over CNN all over
[08:06.480 --> 08:11.760]  Fox News introduced legislation all over the country at a banal semi-autos they've got
[08:11.760 --> 08:15.960]  the former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens saying repeal the second amendment
[08:15.960 --> 08:21.240]  and this took the Republicans who were 5 10 15 points putting on the pole behind with this
[08:21.240 --> 08:26.640]  big blue wave coming in and re-energize people woke them up that yeah we're in round two here
[08:26.640 --> 08:32.880]  the war hadn't over it just started and now we're in a fighting position here so I gotta
[08:32.880 --> 08:38.040]  tell you the 4d chess is is working Ted Nugent we salute you thanks for coming on well thanks
[08:38.040 --> 08:42.400]  Alex and God bless you and everybody that I know that are performing their original
[08:42.400 --> 08:47.480]  founding fathers vision of we the people by raising hell and spotlighting cockroaches
[08:47.480 --> 08:53.080]  and it's never in my 70 years of clean and sober rhythm and blues rock and roll American
[08:53.080 --> 08:58.760]  dream of I seen more we the people patriots raising hell and spotlighting more cockroaches
[08:58.760 --> 09:04.640]  than ever before and if I may Alex this needs to be emphasized now that Stevens has shown
[09:04.640 --> 09:12.200]  the true colors of the liberals and the Democrats now that this so-called Supreme Court so-called
[09:12.200 --> 09:18.160]  justice claims that the second amendment should be repealed let it be known we should emphasize
[09:18.160 --> 09:25.560]  this all the time that when we won the Supreme Court rulings in in the heller in Washington
[09:25.560 --> 09:31.280]  when the Supreme Court determined we do indeed have a God given individual right guaranteed
[09:31.280 --> 09:39.280]  by the Constitution to keep and to bear arms the dissenting paper signed by four of the
[09:39.280 --> 09:43.560]  nine Supreme Court justices I find it hard to even call them that because they don't
[09:43.560 --> 09:50.520]  qualify they actually wrote a dissenting view their opinion their beliefs Alex that not
[09:50.520 --> 09:56.520]  only don't Americans have a right to keep and bear arms but they actually used Alex
[09:56.520 --> 10:05.720]  the Supreme Court justices to find the majority they claim that Americans have no basic right
[10:05.720 --> 10:15.800]  hang on to self defense they actually wrote the words no right to self defense and those
[10:15.800 --> 10:24.520]  tanks wheeze their way onto something called the Supreme Court and are considered to be
[10:24.520 --> 10:29.240]  justices if that doesn't scare the hell out of you then I suppose you might want to get
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.560]  comfortably numb and have a party with you know Michael Moore so these are dangerous
[10:33.560 --> 10:39.760]  times and now the spotlight is hit the biggest and ugliest cockroaches and let it be known
[10:39.760 --> 10:46.760]  the left the Democrats they are on record they want to repeal the Second Amendment if
[10:46.760 --> 10:52.160]  you're not a member of the National Rifle Association you are on the side of people
[10:52.160 --> 10:57.640]  who want to repeal the Second Amendment case closed you're absolutely right and the sickening
[10:57.640 --> 11:03.560]  this of watching the Democrat dupes only nine percent or so were actually a below the age
[11:03.560 --> 11:08.840]  of 18 basically Department of Education March against our Second Amendment these very same
[11:08.840 --> 11:13.040]  leftists have called for my site to be taken down for you to be silenced they played clips
[11:13.040 --> 11:18.080]  of you and me and and and and and Buddhists and all the rest of it and then there they
[11:18.080 --> 11:22.000]  were with the National Guard and the police protecting them good guys with guns and then
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.640]  there's Michael Moore with his six bodyguards because I've had him you know run into me
[11:25.640 --> 11:32.160]  before just trying to interview him in New York and there they are with this justice
[11:32.160 --> 11:40.200]  who to this day even retired justices have up to four federal marshals that basically
[11:40.200 --> 11:45.600]  live with them so these guys have armed guards they are they are protected with taxpayer
[11:45.600 --> 11:49.880]  money but they want to deny us that right isn't that the ultimate form of discrimination
[11:49.880 --> 11:55.880]  well and let's really spotlight the other toxic cockroach in the room you know I know
[11:55.880 --> 12:01.120]  you and again my family my friend I'm in the recording studio with the greatest humans
[12:01.120 --> 12:07.000]  on earth Greg Smith on bass guitar Jason Heartless on drums and Michael Lutz behind the controls
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.960]  I got the greatest positive energy and happiest American dream rock and roll firestorm going
[12:13.960 --> 12:20.240]  on every day of my life but I have to earn it and how I earn it is by not just celebrating
[12:20.240 --> 12:27.000]  the positives and the beauty of hard work and the benefits of freedom but to spotlight
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.760]  the cockroaches and Alex everybody I know you and all my friends and family we believe
[12:32.760 --> 12:39.920]  in law and order and the heroes of law enforcement but the most heartbreaking cockroach in the
[12:39.920 --> 12:47.800]  spotlight now is the turncoats the traitors in the federal Bureau of investigation no
[12:47.800 --> 12:53.520]  wonder they don't feel guilty walking in buildings to say J Edgar Hoover over the entrance way
[12:53.520 --> 13:00.760]  now there are great heroes in law enforcement but obviously and it breaks my heart that
[13:00.760 --> 13:10.320]  the FBI is infested with traitors and liars and scammers and criminal punks who have turned
[13:10.320 --> 13:15.800]  on we the people do you know Alex that the FBI followed those two photo a la monsters
[13:15.800 --> 13:22.840]  to Dallas to gun down innocent Americans at the Mohammed a la photo cartoon contest thank
[13:22.840 --> 13:29.480]  God the Dallas police killed him dead but the FBI followed those two terrorists to the
[13:29.480 --> 13:39.280]  event Alex watched it unfold took photos the FBI Alex this isn't you know this isn't
[13:39.280 --> 13:49.600]  the ms-13 this is the FBI documenting watching monitoring following terrorists shooting AK
[13:49.600 --> 13:59.040]  47s and innocent Americans at a public event and the FBI didn't intervene they left Alex
[13:59.040 --> 14:03.280]  thank God for the heroes of law enforcement the Dallas police department who shot the
[14:03.280 --> 14:08.200]  two subhuman devils dead how beautiful was that I'm glad you mentioned that because that
[14:08.200 --> 14:12.560]  came out that came out months ago and almost got no coverage in fact pull up the article
[14:12.560 --> 14:20.240]  where FBI agents watched the Islamists fire their their AK 47s into the building and then
[14:20.240 --> 14:25.520]  we're taking out the seconds and then there was almost no coverage why did they do that
[14:25.520 --> 14:30.800]  then you learn the Justice Department has been protecting jihadis like we saw in San
[14:30.800 --> 14:35.320]  Bernardino and demoting FBI agents to try to do their jobs and then putting weirdos
[14:35.320 --> 14:42.520]  like reality winner that crazy ISIS connected lady you know inside the NSA inside the CIA
[14:42.520 --> 14:49.280]  they have put literal whack jobs throughout our government and Alex you know I know you're
[14:49.280 --> 14:56.680]  attacked and I'm attached for claiming these most outrageous unbelievable claims and and
[14:56.680 --> 15:02.320]  identifications of documented events but the reason we're condemned for doing this is because
[15:02.320 --> 15:10.520]  what we are exposing what we are documenting is absolutely in the unbelievable column that
[15:10.520 --> 15:17.040]  the heroes of the federal Bureau of Investigation would turn on the people of America this is
[15:17.040 --> 15:25.200]  unbelievable but it's happening you know you see that the FBI is like a whitey bulger
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.240]  I mean the FBI in Boston knew this guy was killing and maiming and torturing and raping
[15:30.240 --> 15:36.880]  and and committing all these felonies pretty much every other day and the FBI looked the
[15:36.880 --> 15:48.200]  other way Alex this is like in the the movie the not the Patriot but Braveheart when when
[15:48.200 --> 15:54.320]  Wallace was going to go kill the king and the henchmen came back with his with his lance
[15:54.320 --> 16:02.120]  and it turned out to be Wallace's that's right stay right there ID stronghold wallets are

[20:45.320 --> 20:53.920]  musicians period and of course the the fire starter out there defending the republic
[20:53.920 --> 20:59.040]  ted newton and the reason i love ted newton so much is i realized how evil the global
[20:59.040 --> 21:04.200]  star their minions all these scumbags that lust after running our lives that are threatened
[21:04.200 --> 21:09.160]  by red blooded americans that are threatened by strong men and strong women and who are
[21:09.160 --> 21:14.480]  threatened by independence they want to capture that spirit and if you go to one of these
[21:14.480 --> 21:21.920]  anti-gun marches they look like drooling mindless pathetic chicken-necked vicious little zombies
[21:21.920 --> 21:27.920]  who always try to beat up our camera people and not let anybody have speech so you just
[21:27.920 --> 21:33.720]  look at people at a ted newton concert versus you go look at the folks in anti-gun rally
[21:33.720 --> 21:38.600]  you can see that they're a bunch of pathetic followers led by criminals now coming up we
[21:38.600 --> 21:42.640]  got the big interview in the third hour with ted newton inside his home amazing behind
[21:42.640 --> 21:47.880]  the scenes stuff the antidote to tyranny but you were on fire during the break for four
[21:47.880 --> 21:53.760]  minutes talking about rich Wyatt talking about finishing up about you know the criminal elements
[21:53.760 --> 21:57.560]  inside government how we got to deal with it and of course the next shoe to drop their
[21:57.560 --> 22:02.840]  next assault so let's talk about it well you know i'm like i said alex god bless you and
[22:02.840 --> 22:06.280]  everybody out there that bust their ass to be in the acid column working hard playing
[22:06.280 --> 22:10.800]  hard americans these are my friends these are real americans who make sacrifices and take
[22:10.800 --> 22:15.220]  risks and they are alive and well we are alive and well and thank god for you and a bunch
[22:15.220 --> 22:19.400]  of us out here we're getting the truth and logic and common sense across in spite of
[22:19.400 --> 22:24.240]  the mainstream you know him or media propaganda ministry but what i was wrapping up on our
[22:24.240 --> 22:30.880]  last segment is that it's really a heartbreaker and it really does qualify as unbelievable
[22:30.880 --> 22:35.560]  the level of criminality in the top of our government at the top of the fb i with the
[22:35.560 --> 22:42.360]  line of combi and and clinton and laurel lynch and eric holder and the gun running president
[22:42.360 --> 22:49.000]  fashion furious barack obama and and and the lowest learner weaponizing the irs i mean
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.560]  these are horror stories that you think would be an adjacent movie in nazi germany but bottom
[22:55.560 --> 23:01.120]  line is we have got to continue to raise hell with our elected officials make certain were
[23:01.120 --> 23:05.800]  members of the nr a and i'll bring a case in point my good friend the law enforcement
[23:05.800 --> 23:10.680]  hero rich white who had a wonderful tv show called american guns with his family out of
[23:10.680 --> 23:17.320]  denver colorado the a tf a couple of rogue agents and the lunatic friend came and tackled
[23:17.320 --> 23:23.000]  this guy and remember he's a law he's a cop all his life he's on tv with his ffl and crossing
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.200]  his t's and doting his eyes rich white has been in jail for over a year because he was
[23:28.200 --> 23:33.020]  targeted as a pro second amendment guy and didn't quite have the visible voice that guys
[23:33.020 --> 23:38.160]  like you and i do so i want my friends out there in colorado and beyond start asking
[23:38.160 --> 23:45.240]  questions about why rich white a hero a great law abiding american rich white is in prison
[23:45.240 --> 23:49.640]  and that's a proof that this government when it is out of control to the level where the
[23:49.640 --> 23:58.600]  fb i is turning on us and violating their oath to the constitution alex this is tragic
[23:58.600 --> 24:03.760]  so what you're doing is spotlighting cockroaches what i'm doing is spotlighting cockroaches
[24:03.760 --> 24:09.320]  as shawn andy does a great job tucker carlson does a great job laura engren does a great
[24:09.320 --> 24:15.160]  job rush limbaugh does a great job everybody on our side in various levels and various
[24:15.160 --> 24:21.440]  styles we're spotlighting cockroaches so if the people if people listening are not members
[24:21.440 --> 24:26.640]  of the nr a the left in the america haters thank you if you don't raise hell with your
[24:26.640 --> 24:32.400]  elected officials nancy polosi thinks you're on her side so this is the real bottom line
[24:32.400 --> 24:38.960]  is that we have got to raise hell with our elected employees and keep on them till we
[24:38.960 --> 24:44.640]  see some accountability until the day the red a lynch and eric holder and hillary clinton
[24:44.640 --> 24:52.520]  and lois learner and barack obama are in jail there is no justice in america you're right
[24:52.520 --> 24:57.000]  and and and just remembering the whole rich white case these were a tf guys he went shooting
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.880]  with he knew it was just a bizarre leftist targeting yeah because he was popular he was
[25:01.880 --> 25:06.560]  on the news they're targeting us all and and let's not forget over ten thousand christian
[25:06.560 --> 25:11.920]  charities churches harassed people arrested and it came out in the documents that they
[25:11.920 --> 25:15.760]  were targeting them knowing they hadn't done anything wrong and then no one even got in
[25:15.760 --> 25:20.520]  trouble that is not see germany or soviet union level so of course the democrats want
[25:20.520 --> 25:23.880]  to ban our speech of course they want to set us up and put us in prison they ship guns
[25:23.880 --> 25:28.920]  to mexico we now know from cbs news to blame the second amendment so they are criminals
[25:28.920 --> 25:33.080]  there is no uh... length they won't go and and and i want to go back to this is pretty
[25:33.080 --> 25:35.680]  from the time we have in your big interviews coming up we appreciate your time uncle ted
[25:35.680 --> 25:40.880]  and you can get back on the city over this killer record i hear is coming out looking
[25:40.880 --> 25:48.280]  at this and talking to you and saying listen the tactic is say we want to hear what they
[25:48.280 --> 25:52.280]  want so they come out and tell us they want to ban everything if you know that's the real
[25:52.280 --> 25:59.560]  plan and then you said just watch trump knows what he's doing and it's it's it's it's happening
[25:59.560 --> 26:04.440]  got them to come out admit the truth and completely blow up in their face and i just can't believe
[26:04.440 --> 26:08.560]  how stupid they are uh... but you can give people any mortal inside baseball about some
[26:08.560 --> 26:12.280]  of the conversations the n r a or some of the conversations with these congressmen and
[26:12.280 --> 26:18.080]  folks well first of all i mean i even i hate even saying the words never show your hand
[26:18.080 --> 26:25.680]  but i just did but that doesn't mean i'm showing my hand but there is a strategy there is improvised
[26:25.680 --> 26:33.440]  adapt and overcome in the world of the outrageous freedom-hating constitution crushing liberal
[26:33.440 --> 26:40.600]  left democrat assault on what used to be america and donald trump is a clever guy i believe
[26:40.600 --> 26:45.280]  that one hundred percent my heart sold that he is maneuvering that's why he continues
[26:45.280 --> 26:50.960]  to change his administration because it's difficult to find honest people it's difficult to find
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.120]  people that will stay on his campaign agenda and i see a lot of people squawking that he
[26:56.120 --> 27:05.600]  uh... he's backing off and the omnibus uh... bill the budget is on absolute cluster whack
[27:05.600 --> 27:12.920]  but believe me he's fighting at the pace at least equal to the incrementalism that we
[27:12.920 --> 27:18.800]  lost these rights that we wasted our tax dollars that we pay our enemies that we pay a plan
[27:18.800 --> 27:24.160]  for parenthood scram scam that we pay the project he's already he's already reversed
[27:24.160 --> 27:29.960]  so much as a godsend but expanding on that it's almost like police hostage negotiators
[27:29.960 --> 27:34.920]  when they say to the guy that's got the woman you say what is it you want will give you
[27:34.920 --> 27:38.280]  anything you want we're not going to give them what they want we're wanting them to go
[27:38.280 --> 27:42.280]  we want to take your rights and enslave you we're total criminal scum george soros we
[27:42.280 --> 27:48.320]  love him and they did it he said what do you want they said we want everything listen
[27:48.320 --> 27:52.720]  to the words from all the leftist all the gun grabbers all the second amendment haters
[27:52.720 --> 27:57.080]  that they want quote these are talking points from hell him we're going to do a better job
[27:57.080 --> 28:03.720]  than this we're all looking we all agree most of america wants common sense gun safety regulations
[28:03.720 --> 28:09.920]  that has nothing to do with their agenda i own hundreds of guns and they're all perfectly
[28:09.920 --> 28:17.040]  safe most of them which the supreme court numb nut stevens and hillary clinton barack
[28:17.040 --> 28:21.880]  obama and fast and furious holder and lynch they would take my guns in a heartbeat if they
[28:21.880 --> 28:27.440]  could in fact diane feinstein is on record more than once saying we would take them
[28:27.440 --> 28:35.560]  all tonight if we could that's not ambiguous when they say australian style gun laws that
[28:35.560 --> 28:43.600]  means coming to your door and taking your guns and that means you're a semi automatic
[28:43.600 --> 28:48.880]  benelli goose gun unbelievable i'm going to make him hold the one more segment is finish

[33:34.120 --> 33:39.360]  i gotta tell you i have been around a lot of professional guitar players and seen them
[33:39.360 --> 33:46.600]  play in person and a fellow conservative and patriot christian of course one of the guys
[33:46.600 --> 33:51.680]  that helped found metallica and of course megadeth they mustain and that's kind of almost a classical
[33:51.680 --> 34:00.120]  style and they're playing that fast but with ted newgent the grinding grungy blues power
[34:00.120 --> 34:07.160]  of it in person was just it wasn't even real and in fact we had nice microphones they're
[34:07.160 --> 34:11.200]  just regular microphones on the cameras it's still amazing when the interview comes up
[34:11.200 --> 34:16.680]  some of the songs he plays star spangled banner stranglehold some of the new stuff he's doing
[34:16.680 --> 34:21.720]  but to hear it in person because he had the amp turned up but you know usually when the
[34:21.720 --> 34:26.520]  amps cranked up you you don't like blasting sound at least i don't but i did i wanted
[34:26.520 --> 34:35.560]  more of it the labs though they they when they see daddy start going for the for the
[34:35.560 --> 34:40.120]  for the guitar they start backing away though i can imagine the dog ears show there's footage
[34:40.120 --> 34:45.120]  of all that his dogs are awesome i love dogs and it's it's a great interview but just how
[34:45.120 --> 34:50.920]  american and down to earth and unpretentious patriots are whether they're from michigan
[34:50.920 --> 34:57.680]  or texas or northern california or upstate new york or florida or west virginia or tennessee
[34:57.680 --> 35:03.880]  or illinois they're just good real people and then you get around globalist and liberals
[35:03.880 --> 35:10.120]  and minions and they're like lobotomized fruit cakes at the bottom and at the top it's a bunch
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.000]  of criminals let me tell you the average leftist it's about power and with ted newgent got
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.000]  into the fact that he's not against the police he's against a police state like north korea
[35:20.000 --> 35:25.840]  is a police state communist china is a police state collapse venezuela is a another wondrous
[35:25.840 --> 35:31.760]  communist utopia that bernie sanders would give us and when the irs is persecuting gun
[35:31.760 --> 35:35.480]  shops and gun owners and when the government ship and guns into mexico to blame the second
[35:35.480 --> 35:39.800]  amendment and when they're trying to put ted newgent and president constantly for legally
[35:39.800 --> 35:44.800]  hunting these leftist game wardens and people we we know that 80 percent of the cops and
[35:44.800 --> 35:49.400]  people are good but in these leftist areas they let people beat women in the head with
[35:49.400 --> 35:55.400]  bike locks at berkeley and the police sit there and smile while a professor walks up
[35:55.400 --> 36:00.040]  in clubs some woman in the head in a crowd like out of a nightmare movie like a bunch
[36:00.040 --> 36:06.280]  of vampires grabs a woman and sucks her into a cloud and then breaks four of her bones
[36:06.280 --> 36:11.480]  and and and the way antifa here and in the uk will walk right up to women and men will
[36:11.480 --> 36:17.360]  just start beating women up and the left goes yeah just like their ally with radical islam
[36:17.360 --> 36:22.280]  and the gentle mutilation excuse me i'm ranting uncle ted i want you to get back up the studio
[36:22.280 --> 36:28.280]  just putting a book in on that the new record other ted bits i mean i'm confident as long
[36:28.280 --> 36:33.560]  as we get out and speak we're gonna keep the house trump starting to move against bezos
[36:33.560 --> 36:38.040]  and the globalist a lot of exciting things happening and we are an instant gratification
[36:38.040 --> 36:42.400]  country but i agree with you we need to be thanking our lucky stars the american people
[36:42.400 --> 36:46.600]  put trump over the top and now we've got a fighting chance well i'm in the studio making
[36:46.600 --> 36:53.800]  on those my 40 or 50th record i started recording back in 1916 with by detroit band but i'm having
[36:53.800 --> 36:58.560]  the time of my life but i'm more than happy to put the guitar down and earn my american
[36:58.560 --> 37:04.880]  dream by performing my we the people responsibilities to raise hell and demand constitutional accountability
[37:04.880 --> 37:12.880]  for my elected employees that's all that americans really are our duty bound to perform and so
[37:12.880 --> 37:19.840]  i beg and beseech implore and prod and control and pound if i have to my fellow americans
[37:19.840 --> 37:24.320]  who think if they just nod when they hear truth and logic and common sense like this
[37:24.320 --> 37:31.040]  that's not enough you have to be a member of the nr a you have to vote if we let democrats
[37:31.040 --> 37:37.040]  who have made it clear and unambiguous that they want to repeal the second amendment they'll
[37:37.040 --> 37:44.480]  tell you they don't but they want to repeal the second amendment they want to force americans
[37:44.480 --> 37:51.520]  into unarmed helplessness so if you don't help defeat democrats if you don't get republicans
[37:51.520 --> 37:56.720]  in there and then hold their feet to the fire with constant constitutional pressure then
[37:56.720 --> 38:05.040]  you are the enemy of america apathy is worse than liberalism apathy is worse than a democrat

[39:28.480 --> 39:33.920]  and evil it is and then the spirit of ted newton in person so i've met him before and and he'd
[39:33.920 --> 39:41.200]  been on the show for 16 and 17 years he's been coming on but i was going out a little
[39:41.200 --> 39:47.360]  radio stations uh he would like call the station found the hotline number and you called him on
[39:47.360 --> 39:54.400]  the show too so he's a listener and his social wife but um when i think about people like them
[39:54.400 --> 39:59.200]  and how genuine and strong they are and how honorable they are and then i look at the
[39:59.200 --> 40:03.920]  democrats and the globalists and they're just a bunch of dumb followers a bunch of dumb helpless
[40:03.920 --> 40:13.840]  sheep and and then evil people controlling them coming up the next segment i'm gonna actually
[40:13.840 --> 40:24.240]  frame this because my son at 15 out of the gates has his video and his new story on the
[40:24.240 --> 40:32.160]  number one website in the world drudgereport.com so that's coming up the next segment my son had
[40:32.160 --> 40:40.640]  the idea yesterday nobody knows not before he he shot it yesterday and he said dad

[41:00.960 --> 41:07.360]  it's up on drudgereport.com the lower right hand corner and i think that drudge link to me
[41:07.360 --> 41:11.520]  means more than any of the others i've had over the years that's great i don't know the spirit
[41:11.520 --> 41:15.680]  cooking one three days for the election which the globalist thing was one of the key things that's
[41:15.680 --> 41:20.720]  sitting over the top that's pretty important speaking of spirit cooking i'm going to cover this
[41:20.720 --> 41:32.560]  as well there is that in xivm group that reportedly brands the women and starves them and sex slaves
[41:32.560 --> 41:37.440]  them and is into the occult lab dungeons and that's what fifty shades of gray it's like a feeder
[41:37.440 --> 41:43.040]  into these things and then there's cults deeper than that that's just mid-level of course hillary
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.200]  clinton's connected to it and all these top senators and democrats are and and then they're
[41:47.200 --> 41:50.800]  trying to deny they were part of the sex cult though but then the very democrats that are listed
[41:50.800 --> 41:57.520]  here the senators and people they're in the article in full wars dot com they are tweeting out the
[41:57.520 --> 42:09.520]  image of the allister crowdy high priestess isn't that interesting the spirit cooking
[42:09.520 --> 42:20.720]  and marina abramovich and you look at that woman the narcissism the the the the the look of arrogance
[42:20.720 --> 42:26.240]  that she's so powerful and she can make you live longer and she's like a vampire they say so she
[42:26.240 --> 42:31.360]  looks pretty oh give me a break she videos over ten years it looks like a hag at the point is is
[42:31.360 --> 42:37.760]  that her soul's ugly and so oh they're all sharing pictures of her but they're not part of any sex
[42:37.760 --> 42:45.600]  cults or anything there's just the pedestrian emails where they they say you're coming to the ritual
[42:45.600 --> 42:52.800]  we got the blood the semen i mean it's all what's going on so that's why i get so angry at these

[46:11.200 --> 46:17.120]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex president to endorse
[46:17.120 --> 46:24.000]  the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and
[46:24.000 --> 46:30.240]  xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[46:30.240 --> 46:36.640]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs
[46:36.640 --> 46:43.840]  and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way
[46:43.840 --> 46:51.360]  we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies
[46:51.360 --> 46:58.160]  with the clenched fist of truth i'm the national rifle association of america and i'm freedoms

[48:20.640 --> 48:23.520]  even though one of those ads is about a thousand dollars a minute
[48:23.520 --> 48:34.800]  i run it and eat a thousand dollars every time comprende i pay to air the n r a
[48:35.840 --> 48:42.240]  figure that out so you guys don't get it do you i'm not doing this for money i'm not doing

[49:14.800 --> 49:20.560]  trying to get rid of our sponsors you people are pathetic you know now though that it drove up the
[49:20.560 --> 49:27.280]  prices to be on my channel and now actually a lot more money is coming in it's it's just crazy
[49:27.280 --> 49:31.520]  youtube couldn't even control themselves because the channel is just such a premium now that they
[49:31.520 --> 49:39.840]  can upsell everybody and the just the ads are just pouring in ridiculous so let me tell you
[49:39.840 --> 49:44.880]  your story right maybe matters they're not paying to be on the radio they're paying to be on the
[49:44.880 --> 49:51.600]  internet video side of it and they love the results they're getting so stick that your pipe
[49:52.400 --> 49:56.480]  i know you guys are like the referee and the arbiters and you're the adults and we're the
[49:56.480 --> 50:00.960]  children and you tell us what words to use and how to act and what to do it doesn't work like that

[50:16.640 --> 50:20.960]  even though i thought it would be a three-month supply because people are into tumor and they're
[50:20.960 --> 50:24.720]  into the amazing benefits and everything that you know they know it does and they know that we
[50:24.720 --> 50:33.280]  have a 95 per cent curcumin and level 450 milligrams per powdered capsule and that that is at the very
[50:33.280 --> 50:41.520]  top of the industry at a price way lower than competitors the average has a curcumin and level

[52:37.680 --> 52:43.120]  how he has ridiculous talking points like the pope saying that uh there is no hell he must like i
[52:43.120 --> 52:49.440]  said it's like muscle of satan is the pope i expect the pope to say next worship lucifer he is god
[52:49.440 --> 52:55.520]  side issue uh just just just unbelievable uh alex jones son challenges david hogg to a gun
[52:55.520 --> 53:02.240]  debate so very powerful video and uh i'm just proud of him so this this is my son's work here it is
[53:02.240 --> 53:08.000]  hello mr hogg my name is rex jones and i want to make a public statement about you claiming
[53:08.000 --> 53:13.680]  to speak for my generation about guns if you listen real close you can hear the people in
[53:13.680 --> 53:20.080]  power shaking they've gotten used to being protective of their position during safety
[53:20.720 --> 53:29.760]  the safety of inaction inaction is no longer safe and to that we say no more hogg you claim
[53:29.760 --> 53:35.920]  that the establishment is shaking in its boots in fear of you no they love you they love gun control
[53:35.920 --> 53:42.880]  they've wanted this for years if i could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the united states
[53:42.880 --> 53:51.120]  for an outright ban picking up every one of them mr and mrs america turn them all in i would have
[53:51.120 --> 53:56.800]  done it here's the legislation that you supported in georgia uh the the last assault weapons ban
[53:56.800 --> 54:01.280]  democrats in your state push and i'm quoting from the legislation right here the georgia bureau of
[54:01.280 --> 54:07.360]  investigations shall seize and take possession possession of any assault weapon large capacity
[54:07.360 --> 54:13.520]  magazine armor piercer bullet or incendiary 50 caliber bullet shall seize and take possession of
[54:13.520 --> 54:18.560]  it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a monday and then only do it every monday we need
[54:18.560 --> 54:24.480]  to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly
[54:24.480 --> 54:31.760]  different way you've heard people say you'll have to pry my gun from my cold day okay
[54:36.240 --> 54:41.200]  it is admitted they want to disarm the american people just as they have done with so many corrupt
[54:41.200 --> 54:46.560]  regimes in the past hitler solin mao north korea do you think those places do you think those corrupt
[54:46.560 --> 54:50.480]  leaders allowed their citizens to have guns do you think that the jews were able to protect
[54:50.480 --> 54:55.040]  themselves when hitler put them in concentration camps no they were disarmed and that's why they
[54:55.040 --> 55:01.040]  were enslaved hog you're a public figure and you call my dad a piece of shi you know what
[55:01.040 --> 55:05.280]  and you say all kinds of other horrible things you've challenged him to a debate and then backed
[55:05.280 --> 55:09.680]  out of it the fact is you and your fellow students have been handpicked by the mainstream media to
[55:09.680 --> 55:14.160]  misrepresent the american people and make it look like the average young american team wants to have
[55:14.160 --> 55:19.360]  their first and second amendment taken away many people in your name such as cnn have called for
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.160]  my father to band off youtube and claim that it's bullying to say that it's authoritarianism to repeal
[55:24.160 --> 55:29.360]  the second amendment mainstream media uses you as a child human shield so you can go out and make
[55:29.360 --> 55:34.480]  outrageous statements without anyone being allowed to rebut you without being labeled a bully the
[55:34.480 --> 55:40.320]  truth is mr hog the george soros and the groups funding your anti-gun march are a clear and present
[55:40.320 --> 55:46.000]  danger to this country and draw clear parallels to nazi germany in the authoritarian regimes of the
[55:46.000 --> 55:53.360]  past well david hog here we are we're at the peace officer's memorial in downtown austin these
[55:53.360 --> 55:59.040]  brave men and women took an oath to uphold the constitution the sheriff in your state did too
[55:59.040 --> 56:04.080]  but he didn't protect you all he stayed outside while the massacre happened and you like to blame
[56:04.080 --> 56:08.880]  that on guns i say we shouldn't blame that on guns we should blame that on the sheriff that failed
[56:08.880 --> 56:15.840]  to act but no you make apologies for him you said that going down a barrel of an ar-15 is
[56:15.840 --> 56:21.280]  dangerous and you understood why he was scared going down the barrel of an ar-15 is that man's
[56:21.280 --> 56:28.560]  job and for you to make apologies for him it's absolutely disgusting the veterans who died in
[56:28.560 --> 56:33.600]  the revolutionary war and the war of 1812 they died to protect this country from the british
[56:33.600 --> 56:39.520]  they died to protect their civil rights in world war two and world war one american soldiers went
[56:39.520 --> 56:46.960]  across the globe to protect our freedoms you say that those freedoms are obsolete that no one needs
[56:46.960 --> 56:54.640]  a weapon of war were you taught in school david hog about how our country was founded were you

[57:10.720 --> 57:16.880]  know how that happened brave men and women like the men and women behind me stood up and they said
[57:16.880 --> 57:22.640]  no we will not submit to tyranny and that is what you were doing you were submitting to tyranny
[57:22.640 --> 57:27.360]  you were begging to have the rights that our forefathers fought for stripped away you say

[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.440]  free speech in the uk and all the islamist stuff going on he's still going to be joining us but
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:43.760]  it's becoming staggering they they're now eu wide saying that child sex with muslims is okay
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:49.760]  because it's their culture it's unbelievable i mean this is so crazy i'm having trouble believing
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:55.600]  it this was officially put out by the swedish government it's on info wars.com it's it's
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:01.200]  translated out of swedish and it shows men with little girls i mean it's it's next level and they
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:09.920]  have children shows on german pbs on their public television teaching 14 year olds to have a 25 year
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:17.920]  old islamic husband i mean i just said that it sounds like a lie and it's true i mean you know what
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:24.560]  i mean that's so crazy i can't even believe it anymore so let's stop right there that's coming
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:32.320]  up it just gets more insane i these people are insane and the devil worshiping and arrest made
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:40.160]  in women in cages and starving them and branding them and and and wasn't a fox's daughter connected
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:44.320]  to it and u.s senators connected and then they try to say oh we're not connected but then their
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:52.080]  twitter account they're they're tweeting out uh allister crowley's high priestess spirit cooking
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:08:00.640]  i mean it's just like really really devil worship slaves must immediately answer their masters anytime
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:06.080]  they text or call them and if they do not recruit enough slaves of their own they are beaten with
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.720]  a paddle and that's just the entrance of the cult and then the women must be at starvation level
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.120]  oh just get get up above whatever her name is off the screen i can't look at her
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.360]  now last night
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:30.000]  next day afternoon dr coursey calls me and he says ted malik former board member of the devils
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.720]  group head of the aspen institute you know a patriot mole inside the global a best-selling
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:40.480]  author professor was flying in from london where he lives he's an anglophile he's an american but
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:47.360]  he lives in england and they grab him off they they read him as rights they they were all about
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:56.880]  roger stone coursey our operation and then they take his phone uh we're gonna go over all right
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:02.960]  now with dr serum coursey this is a big big big big deal that this is how big the dragnet is
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:09.680]  is that i guess because he talked about talking to an mi6 agent that told him that the wiki leaks
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:14.640]  had gotten the stuff downloaded which we now know from william benny formerly the director of the
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.880]  nsh technical and that it wasn't hacked from a distance so they want to know all about this
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:27.520]  and it just shows how huge the dragnet is my security team just the other day documented
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.400]  and the feds wanted me to know because the feds have got cars with little numbers on the front
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:38.480]  fender feds out here following me i don't know what for them if people think that's going to
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:45.840]  intimidate me i've got to have figured out i'm i can't be intimidated because i'm committed
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.920]  until death to fight this because i know we're dealing with a bunch of pedophile devil worshipers
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:55.760]  so it's not hard to say i'm committed a hundred percent because i'm actually panicking like a
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.480]  drowning man you understand getting away from them that's what this is this whole show is that
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.600]  fight or flight i'm fighting this is my panic completely freaked out fighting against a bunch
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.960]  of devil worshipers you got to figure it out i only know one direction that's forward

[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:57.600]  soon you think this is a one-way street buster it's not this is real so get ready and the news
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:02.320]  is like oh trump's obsessed with it that it's killing main street and that it's anti-american
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:09.200]  and that he thinks the washington post is weaponized thinks it's weaponized they publicly hired over
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:15.360]  300 former cia operatives from information warfare division under obama to run the washington post
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:22.640]  now it's a giant cia breakaway criminal network yeah i'm glad the president's obsessed with it
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:30.960]  they're lucky they're just getting their asses handed to them financially all right i'm sorry
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:38.000]  let's go to dr. coursey so author of killing the deep state the fight to save president trump

[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.120]  him this morning he didn't want to come on yet but just describe what he told you they did well
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:01.520]  it's it's going to be more and more incredible i mean ted malik is okay he's in ohio hey he's um

[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.160]  now yes it's all great they went to a judge in mass miller went to a judge in massachusetts
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:25.840]  to get the subpoena for ted to appear before the grand jury on the you know the russian collusion
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.600]  case they went to somebody in massachusetts i guess they couldn't find a liberal enough judge in in
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.560]  washington then they want to keep ted's cell phone it's the only cell phone he's out using his
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:42.000]  wife's cell phone which is in london it doesn't really work that well here calling the london
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.400]  to have it bounce back here they won't give him his cell phone back they say they want to
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:51.600]  scrutinize it and they're going to hold ted and then he's going to come back on april 13th they
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:57.360]  postponed the grand jury appearance to give them more time to break down every little square inch
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:03.360]  of ted's cell phone now i mean this is to me outrageous here ted malik has stopped at the
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.480]  airport he's detained he's brought him into some detention room in the fbi and grilled
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:14.080]  he's told he's going to be forced to go to the grand jury they confiscated his cell phone
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.440]  but he goes off to ohio no cell phone i mean ted malik would have come in voluntarily
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.400]  all the fbi had to do was ask and ted would have been here they did this to shake him up and then
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.800]  later try to say he lied about something to try to flip him to then lie about roger stone
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.360]  that's right and they wrote read him his rights and they just decided you know they told him
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:39.440]  reminded him that anything he said was going to be used against him in terms of uh lying to the fbi
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:44.560]  he had no lawyer he went in and talked with them without a lawyer now he's getting a lawyer today
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:50.640]  to try to uh assist him through this but this is like a bad f you know edward g robinson 1930
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:56.240]  movie i mean i'm i'm tweeting i'm tweeting out and pounding miller i mean miller is the one who next
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.600]  gets to be he needs to be under investigation along with rozenstein for their role in covering up
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:07.200]  this uranium one bribery scheme by russia which they i don't think sypheus the committee on
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.440]  foreign investment of the united states would have allowed hillary's deal to go through with russia
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:16.880]  buying uranium one if miller and rozenstein have let that information be made available to the
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:21.520]  committee i'm asking miller how much did he get paid what's his net worth how much did hillary pay
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:27.120]  of the 147 million dollars that she got we know well that's what's crazy is we got him on tar max
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:33.280]  147 million 30 million to the pedestrian brother uh all this russia connections selling the country
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:37.840]  out and then they've been doing a proctology exam on everybody associated with trump have found nothing
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.440]  they admit that and now they're moving on to process crimes this is just insane and then
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.440]  trach out he tries to score points you know with the establishment goes and i like trach got him
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.400]  anyways but he's like jim jordan everybody you don't need to knock it off and by the way stop acting
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.600]  like you're guilty trump when you're when they've expanded the investigation into how long his toenails
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.640]  are and nothing's been found in hillary is literally in league selling out one third of our strategic
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:08.160]  uranium in fricking tarmac meetings out of a james bond movie this is ridiculous fine keep
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.520]  investigating trump investigate me but in diet hillary in the podestas and all these other jerks
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:20.000]  and and a miller you can't have miller in tarmac meetings for the clintons with the russians and

[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.720]  by the way rosa and bar to set the president caller congratulator on the number one show in
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:47.600]  the last two or three years of all the declining ratings 18 million viewers in the key demographic
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.000]  the other hit shows have like five six million now the people are sick of hollywood their leftist
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:58.880]  garbage it's just a balanced show that shows some libertarian and naturalist views and rosa by the
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.840]  way is a listener i can tell you to a certain extent she said it well i helped partially get
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.720]  her from being a mainline leftist to a free thinker she's been on years ago she said she
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.720]  come on i was talking to her yesterday via twitter and i know she's getting slammed but
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.760]  she's a hotter than a firecracker hotter than white hot metal right now and we would love to get
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:23.040]  her on the broadcast so that's how ridiculous i am too like i even had her number and i don't
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.600]  think i put in the computer right so i'm gonna ask her for a number right now the point is i
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:32.400]  want to get her on because i don't normally care about hollywood i i don't want to be but getting
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:38.320]  mavericks on and her standing up to the bullying and all of it and then getting top ratings again
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:46.000]  that's what people want and they're tired of being lectured to constantly now the globalists
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.480]  are panicking obviously and dr jerome course he's here with us so this is a big deal because
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:56.640]  getting into all the back story ted mellick said academic he's a very trusted guy classically at
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:04.480]  bilgerberg or at davos or the cfr they get a trusted academic to be kind of the custodian or
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:09.840]  the secretary of the thing so there he is on the board of directors at davos for decades help make
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:14.960]  it big founder rassman institute but within americana view there the whole time and i mean i remember
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.080]  even you know covering ted mallard 20 years ago and here's one of the traders ted mallard before
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.480]  i understood how it all worked and then i realized a few years later he was actually fighting globalism
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:29.040]  from from within it but he has nothing to do with the trump administration and nothing to do with any
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:35.360]  of this and the he's been grabbed by the fbi that shows you the dragnet is gigantic it's threatening
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.760]  and because he's not a coward and would tell people we know about it they have talked to almost
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:45.040]  everyone that's bought properties from trump putting just single condos his golf members in new jersey
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:52.480]  in new york in florida this is true harassment and it's next level and you know what the president
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:58.160]  isn't backing down is he he just smashed amazon by pointing out that they're running a major scan
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:02.800]  with their inside tax deals and things and that brought the stock down massively for 30 plus billion
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:09.040]  so the the globalist better get it dr corcy that all of their harassing us all of them
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:15.840]  persecuting us it's not making us put our tail between our ledges making us dig in and intensify
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:23.440]  letting loose the dogs of war well that's exactly right alex and one of the key points today when
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:28.800]  ted malik talked to me and he is okay he's here for easter he's going to stay through easter
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:35.200]  but the point is ted said that the miller's staff were upset that we went public with
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:39.600]  that the grand jury had called him yeah it was supposed to be kept secret squirrel nobody was
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:46.240]  supposed to know that because miller wants to do all of this you know in a camera secret proceeding
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:51.920]  i mean this is disgraceful this is like a cheap 1930 movie i mean if miller wants to behave like
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:56.400]  this i'm telling him let's go out in the backyard and then duke it out i mean this is ridiculous
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:03.120]  i'm tired of seeing the fbi dragged to this level of embarrassment by a hack like miller
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:08.640]  and rozenstein both of them ought to be indicted and and under grand jury subpoena themselves
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:14.000]  for their role in the cover-up of the iranian one russian bribery scheme they they helped hillary
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  make 147 million dollars and now that's being covered up so ted malik saying you know well
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.720]  they said we shouldn't mention anything said ted forget it we'll blast them i want to blast
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:30.240]  and want to call them out you know miller's wants to grab ted's cell phone and look at his cell phone
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.360]  did he take it as he would have taken his laptops eat up with the fbi and cia and all these people
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:40.320]  won't tell you when they're giving it back they're going to scrutinize it down to the last bit of
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:45.200]  data and then they'll bring ted in and if he lies about anything or makes a mistake they'll indict
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:49.840]  him he's going to be the grand jury they can't have any lawyer at the grand jury and they're going to
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:55.040]  testify and for who knows two three days about every little detail of everything he's done back to
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:03.360]  grade school i think it's disgusting i've never heard you i mean because you've been a fan over
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.840]  all the fbi i've never heard you this angry but you're absolutely right and they say that we're
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.600]  trying to pull down the fbi no letting the crottin crime network operate and having a
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.920]  retolension illegal tarmac meetings and having miller when you know when he's not even director
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:24.000]  delivering uranium and so they've changed the subject over to us the liberty movement saying
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.520]  we the patriots that want to make america great again are ruski agents as i mean that's like
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:36.320]  maxine water says the swamp came from putin drain the swamp lock her up came from putin the idea
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:41.680]  that trump can't come up with ideas that i that anybody could tell me what to do you can't stop
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:47.520]  me from interrupting people are shutting up this is ridiculous crap yeah and then the same day i mean
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.160]  i find out the my book killing deep state for two weeks in a row is not going to be on the
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.360]  new york time bestseller list that affects placement of bookstores why it outsold half of
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.800]  the books but you know this this leftist group at the end new york times another bunch of communists
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:07.600]  that ought to go the same way as bezos and the washington post the whole bunch of them you know
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.560]  basically criminal bending the algorithm are you kidding we have the head guy at the new york times
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.640]  over there all their digital operations saying we're interfaced with youtube and we censor alec
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:22.000]  shones the new york times seeing in they've all got their fingers like in a pie and they don't even
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.360]  hide it it's brian stelter anise and cooper goes we're in alexis jones's account we're going to
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:33.920]  get him banned we can see what he's doing i've talked to the lawyers that is illegal man it is
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:40.320]  just crazy to have anderson cooper and brian stelter in my private account yeah and the same
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:47.280]  day again now youtube just demonetized one of my q and on decode so i mean it's all it's all starting
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:53.920]  again now they want to the deep state is desperate and miller is pathetic miller you know is having
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:59.680]  what do they got on him what do they have on this guy on ted malik no no no miller we know
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:06.320]  from the russians we know so just why not why not have why not a federal grand jury
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.440]  impound and died his ass we got him precisely and it was also the cover-up artist of the hsbc
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.520]  case where comey was on the board and he did all that richard jewel fake anthrax stuff
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:22.080]  and the fourth patchy they got they just went ahead and whacked so he you know miller is the one
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.640]  to want to be investigated and rosenstein the two of them ought to be drugged up before grand jury

[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:09.280]  we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:16.720]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:21.920]  researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.440]  immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published trials and
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:32.800]  decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:38.720]  helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:44.000]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.840]  of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:55.920]  go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:04.080]  block chewable tablets you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:23.360]  discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the alex jones show
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:39.760]  you know they have scientifically proven that birds mammals you name it are psychic
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.680]  and they're learning it's actually science that we have electrochemical
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.080]  parts of our brains that are magnetic and then interface with the magnetic field of the planet
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:57.840]  that interface with the solar winds but but also like when you're walking to the woods and you know
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:03.360]  somebody's looking at you and then you you you turn around there they are that's been proven you
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:08.800]  look up the studies and i've got to act on this when this happens because i woke up at 3 30 in the
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:18.720]  morning and i was worried about my dad having a heart attack i never think about that and then
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:23.920]  at 7 in the morning my personal trainer was supposed to come over and he called me he said listen
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:28.400]  my dad had a heart attack in the middle of the night and i'm friends with his dad he's a nice guy
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:35.040]  and so i can't come you know work out with that so well obviously and i'm just saying that that's
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:44.240]  the weird way my brain works and it's not a coincidence it's just those weird things that
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.920]  happen and more and more i do tell people stuff and they you know they see it but that's how psychic
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.560]  stuff works though it's not a hundred percent you can't like get on know exactly what it is you just
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:59.440]  know and it's the same thing with russia i also was like why am i having so much anxiety and i said
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:05.360]  russia's going to change its posture they're they're they're pushing nato forces into the border
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.760]  i guess and i went and looked it up online and sure enough middle of the night that's exactly
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:14.880]  what was going on i don't want to get all mumbo jumbo here it's just i'm really concerned about
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.760]  russia and it's not because i'm on some russian payroll it's because they've got 10 000 nuclear
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:26.160]  weapons and they're a christian nation fighting radical islam and our government has been bombing
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  russian contractors on the ground that are fighting isis i was reading this article
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:39.200]  in reuters earlier in fact after mr robinson leaves us i'll get into it and it was with a
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:44.800]  straight face mattis i talked about yesterday too now i read the whole speech this morning i only
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:47.680]  seen some quotes yesterday but i actually like i said i woke up the whole night was like reading
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.160]  everything mattis actually said i was like god this is where it's not thought he's like we sure
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:56.640]  it taught those russians when we blew a couple hundred of them up a couple months ago and watch it
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:00.640]  now russia's working with us and pulled out their people so we don't blow more of them up and it's
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:07.200]  like you read it and it's said the russian mercenaries yeah right sheep dip spetsnaat were
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:17.440]  fighting isis and us back rebels so the pentagon still trying to keep a group of nazis in there
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:22.000]  which already knew from my military sources months ago and of course trump's been double
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.960]  crossed on that i know for a fact that's one reason he got rid of mcmaster and i got that directly
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:35.840]  from high level cia and folks i don't just say that okay so where do you think i knew three weeks

[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.880]  politician who went to youtube CEOs and she asked them why they're recommending my hate videos
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:03.280]  we had saeed avasi saeed avasi is a muslim a muslim lady she was conservative baroness in our
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:08.080]  house the lords she stood up in parliament talking about my hate we had mark rowley the
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:12.000]  leader of counter terrorism all of these are common purpose we had mark rowley the leader of
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.120]  counter terrorism who stood up who gave press conferences on national tv and again spoke
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:23.520]  about my hate hate is the new word over here hate is the new word we had racists they beat that
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.080]  down they wore that out we had nazi they beat that down they wore that out now the word is hate
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:33.600]  and with hate they don't have to back it up or or or explain it they just say it's hate speech
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:38.320]  and i i know that if i got in front of any one of these individuals any one of them and ask for
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:43.520]  one example what give me give me one example because i've done an interview yesterday with russia
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:48.560]  today it's just gone out today and in that the journalist spoke about my hate and i said to her
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:53.200]  you're a journalist you've obviously researched before this interview have you not she said yes
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:59.600]  give me one example of my hate just one just one that you found and of course you couldn't
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:04.960]  of course you couldn't because the problem is now that's literally speaking you know her response
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:12.560]  was you speak you speak about islam i said yeah so i speak about an ideology a religion and i'm
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.400]  not allowed to that and that's where we're going what they're doing is they're legitimizing and
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:21.440]  criminalizing speak and talk of islam and if you don't support having sex with nine-year-old
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:26.400]  girls are hateful because you know the religion says it's okay this is next level and and what you
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.600]  said is critical and come right back from from breaking up this with tony robinson here banned
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:36.880]  off twitter that sadeek khan and all these people they just say banish and lie about what we've said
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:41.200]  and what we've done and then we're disappeared and then that's really what's hateful that's what's

[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:17.360]  time in robinson for this segment and the next uh you're on fire my friend you know when i mentioned
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:22.640]  this thing about sweden where they fire police chiefs that say 90 plus percent of the rapes are
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:29.520]  muslim uh where they arrest women that uh say it's wrong that muslims are raping people uh where
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:33.760]  they tell women that are rape don't wear short skirts that's the same thing in the netherlands
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:39.040]  also in germany you read this stuff this is coming out of their mouths you know the leader of the
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:45.280]  green party the the the female mayor of cologne uh when hundreds of women get raped she says well
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:52.080]  don't wear short mini skirts or wear a wristband you know saying uh don't rape me this is next
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:52:00.000]  level and now the swedes are finally up in arms over a children's manual and uh government releases
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:07.760]  brochure for migrants legitimizing child marriage uh and and and talking about it uh so this is next
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:13.280]  level i mean as you said is that why the british elite are backing islam is because of its pedophilic
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:19.760]  uh third rail i think that what and what they're doing is they can see that certain people like
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:24.960]  ourselves are now reaching people we're reaching people in large numbers so they're gonna silence us
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:29.600]  they're gonna stop us i've been to sweden i've been to holland i've been to germany i've been to all
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:34.720]  of these countries over the last nine years originally we started going there in 2009 trying
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:40.400]  to wake people up the people weren't ready but there it is now it's bubbling and i'm going out there
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:44.560]  you see more and more people ready more and more people listening due to the internet due to these
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:48.400]  sort of channels due to alternative media people are seeing they're hearing they're seeing the real
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:52.880]  news they're seeing the truth and that's why now they they know that they know that that's why they're
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:57.040]  taking the power back they're silencing us they're removing us and they're doing it across the country
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:02.880]  even if you look in france marie le Pen before the election they removed 10 000 social media accounts
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:08.400]  that were that were pro her they just removed them and when you when you see the power that has
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:13.760]  whenever a negative news article went out about me i tweet the article all the people who have
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:17.920]  followed me obviously their eyes are open they know the truth they've seen what's happening
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:21.360]  they would then go on and react and before you know it they'd be convincing people and arguing
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:26.080]  people and they'd be dialoguing debate but now they've removed me they'll be able to put these
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:31.600]  things up and this child pedophilia is grooming scandal that you're talking about this is going
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:38.400]  on the lips at the entire every single town in our country 70 towns have identified mass
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:44.800]  muslim rape gangs that have been taken english girls 70 or have seen massive cases the bit if i
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:50.400]  ask you what's the two biggest towns you know of of rape scandals in the uk you'll say roverham
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:57.520]  and telford now both of those towns have hardly any muslims hardly any i mean like in roverham
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:01.680]  there's only three and a half thousand men that fit the age of the criteria that could be involved
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:07.120]  in these rates so how many of them were and that's why these towns are being used to skate goats
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:12.400]  because they simply cannot identify the real towns the real problems for example in my town
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:16.800]  where there's instead of three and a half thousand muslims there's a hot there's a hot there's 60 70
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:23.520]  thousand so the real the real rape gangs and the real problems are in bradford are in birmingham
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:28.320]  are in louton are in these sort of towns and none of them none of those towns have had massive
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:32.720]  grooming scandal news because they can't deal with it in those towns they could not do it because
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:40.080]  instead of 1400 children we'd be seeing records of one of 14 000 children we'd be seeing just how
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:47.680]  because let's say it let's say it in the mainline religion of islam abusing boys and girls is the
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:52.240]  religion i mean having sex with boys and either if you're an adult and have gay sex they kill you
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:56.240]  but if you're a man with a boy it's in the caran it's okay this is so out of control
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:00.080]  and that's why the globalists love it that's why you can have sex with nine-year-old girls
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:05.200]  and and and and so the left are a bunch of devil worship pedophiles they love it that's why they
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:10.800]  love islam well in heaven under islam if you marty yourself you get 72 virgins and 14 young boys
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:17.440]  that never grow old 14 young boys they always ignore the 14 young boy part by the way you can
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:24.000]  tell none of these muslims i mean 74 virgins that means little girls folks that sounds like a nightmare
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:30.240]  in the caran it talks about boys that look like pearls beautiful boys that look like pearls
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:35.520]  of course they never talk about this so in heaven everything that they want is loads of young girls
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:40.400]  and loads of young boys and that's what they that's what they're being exactly heaven is a pedophile
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:52.160]  paradise under under that caranic importation it heaven is like heaven is where sandusky goes
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:59.040]  yeah yeah heaven is where and and we see it we see this and and to be honest
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:04.320]  this is what this is what they want to do so it but what i was removed from twitter for saying islam
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:12.160]  promotes killing people it does there's no matter how much state censorship or no matter how many
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:17.200]  twitter companies you can't change 1,400 years of history you can't change a book that has 100
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:22.160]  verses that tells them to kill us it i'm just stating a fact and that's what i've been removed
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:27.200]  from social media for stating a fact because they don't i was told by a new york times writer
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:32.000]  and then i got another phone call like oh this is a message they said you're about to be destroyed
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.640]  this is a year ago and i said what do you want and it didn't mean i was going to give in i said
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:42.400]  off record i said what do you want they said don't talk about islam anymore just just stop it alex
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:47.280]  you've got it i and i realized they're all bought off and i said i will now i'm really going to go
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:55.440]  crazy but and that's and and that's it the more they try to stop the more they try to stop us

[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:03.840]  if this is going to a break now i'll talk about in the next part but i want to say what we want to
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:09.200]  do in britain in response to their attack on our free speech absolutely but i tell you
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:16.320]  it's also defamation why they said they got rid of you it is just sick and hate you're like sorry
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:23.120]  they said hey they said hateful what well because i said islam promotes killing that's hateful is
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:29.600]  lambs hateful islam's hate and you know what hamas hezbollah muslim brotherhood all prescribed terrorist
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:36.640]  organizations all have twitter accounts all promote hate that's another good point hezbollah and

[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:56.080]  one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason going back about five years ago we
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:00.720]  did research on what top selling new tropics were what were most popular what were best what people
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:06.320]  liked and we made it even stronger then we cut the price because leading competitors have five
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:13.520]  to seven times markup we only have 150 percent then it helps funder operation well now it's 50
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:20.400]  percent off that means we've got a 25 percent markup and we've got it paired with the real

[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:44.800]  couple days because both of these bestsellers are about to sell out infohorselife.com to get
[01:59:44.800 --> 02:00:03.600]  your brain force plus and real red pill today you're listening to the alex jones show the answer
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:15.440]  to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show vamportism there are thousands of forms of
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:22.160]  it there's a physical act of drinking the blood but almost all the forms that we see exercised
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:26.720]  are hurting the innocent the youth the beautiful this cult that hillary clinton's connected to
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:31.440]  and these senators and leftists in the news and they arrest for women in cages and being branded
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:39.520]  was like beautiful models starving themselves down to anorexia so that this little weird control
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:44.240]  freak could come in and have them grovel and call him god and you look at him and he just looks like
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:51.200]  a demonic weak pathetic worm that nobody want to be around but hollywood's like a big bug zapper
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:58.560]  that the moths just fly into so when i see a red carpenter i see hollywood now i see a big
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:06.080]  giant rotting dead horse bloated with flies and maggots just all over and i'm serious and i think
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:10.480]  i'm gonna just start having videos where i just show hollywood and just dead animals or rotting
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:14.800]  and or starving children or buzzards eating babies in africa because let me tell you that's
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:21.360]  what it is and it's a big big bug zapper so a bunch of child predators people that prey on
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:26.160]  children and have their way and it's the same thing in the uk mainstream news the uk admits
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:30.720]  it's a national security issue the government's run by pedophiles
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:38.000]  and they have standing ovations in hollywood for roman polanski and you got all the other
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:42.960]  fawning people they're just reporters trying to be part of it because they don't have anything inward
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:49.440]  i mean you'll find god out on a lake in the mist in the morning
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:55.600]  or in the mountains just walking by yourself you will find the devil in hollywood in the
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:00.960]  mainstream system and that is the point tony robinson you're on fire my friend banned from
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:06.560]  twitter not deterred what are you doing to strike back uh with the work you're doing
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:10.400]  against us because you know how it works you've already been imprisoned before for speech and
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:15.120]  lost your house everything else but you came out stronger first they silenced you before they try to
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:21.360]  put your butt in prison we've organized um basically if i give you the last last two three

[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:36.560]  center four days for three days and then deported okay and a canadian lauren southern was held
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:41.520]  detained under the terrorism act and she was deported and banned for life because she talks
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:46.320]  about islam so we're seeing blasphemy laws putting through the back door we've then seen speakers
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:52.640]  corner has been taken over by hostile aggressive mafia style muslims 300 years of free speech in
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:58.400]  our country debate people giving their opinions on feminism on politics all taken over from is it an

[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:18.080]  attack on our freedoms the erosion in the end of free speech that that our rights and our freedoms
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:23.200]  are being taken away from us as we sit by idly and once they've started when you see the progression
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:28.080]  over the matter of weeks think about the matter of years basically we're going to criminalize
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:33.200]  speaking about islam we're going to remove people so on the 6th of may on a sunday we're
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:37.120]  going to meet a speakers corner and we're going to march for our capital city and alex i'll i'll

[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:12.880]  and i don't really want the stunt of being in the news uh but i don't think they've been banning me
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:16.960]  what do you want to bet if i try to fly over there for a free speech rally that they try to ban me
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:24.400]  coming into the country if they possibly would if they did then it lets the world know again

[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:44.400]  i love humanity people think like america was at war with britain in 1776 everything in our
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:51.120]  revolution was an extension of the fights they had there from magna carta up and most the parliament
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:58.320]  supported us and so our revolution was a british revolution we need to fund this operation ladies
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:03.280]  and gentlemen and i make it really easy we went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:09.440]  pills are that are healthy for energy stamina mental clarity you name it and we created a stronger
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:13.600]  formula than some of the best selling formulas out there it's very simple we went out and like
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:17.280]  look what is the top what is the best we'll just put even more product in we'll make it better
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:22.400]  leading competitors but two dollars a product in it sell it for 60 bucks we put ten dollars in it
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:28.720]  and sell it for 30 bucks it's 1995 right now so you get an incredible top of the line new tropic
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:35.280]  for 1995 believe me we're selling it for 35 on average we need that 15 20 bucks we make to fund
[02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:39.840]  this operation in the face the global threat of it but i'm doing this because we got a ton of it
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:44.960]  coming in in two weeks i want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in and i want people
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:50.480]  that haven't tried brain force to try it and find out why it's got 6000 plus five star reviews
[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:55.680]  it's amazing info war store dot com info wars live dot com or triple a two five three one three nine
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:06:13.920]  you got it waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the
[02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:40.960]  info war all right tommy robinson we're finishing up with him and now it's already a best-selling
[02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:44.960]  book politically incorrect guide to climate change we need to carry that i love all these
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:48.240]  great authors on have an online bookstore and i never even make the connection to sell it but
[02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:53.520]  that's how we fund the operation but that marmarano popping in uh here in just a moment um we're
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:07:00.720]  talking to of course tommy robinson tommy robinson uh online dot online and of course twitter no longer
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:07.920]  show that's been deleted and it's because he's smart he's a handsome guy he has courage he takes
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:12.640]  on nine antifa guys and kicks their ass you know the woman um that you know that's doing his camera
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:17.680]  work she beats up a couple of them i mean they're just they're authoritarian thugs and all of us
[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:27.600]  should unify against this and say no so in closing here i can't believe sweden's published a guide on
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:32.240]  how to have sex with children telling people that muslims are allowed to do it i can't believe that's
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:40.960]  up on enforce dot com uh that this is all going on but it is and so what do we do because i don't
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:45.360]  want to sit here and bash muslims i know that there are muslim countries that don't do this stuff i
[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:51.200]  know there's been golden age of muslims i i know you know but but the radical worst forms of it
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:55.600]  are being supported i like the saudi arabian uh prince that's trying to work with the west and
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:59.120]  meeting with rabbis and christians and saying we're in when we're going to drive cars or
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:02.800]  are going to go to college you don't have to wear a jib so they don't want to that's good we need a
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:09.920]  reparation in in in islam i don't want to be at war with it but the elements that won't modernize
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:14.480]  are attacking us and in the left that claims they're the modernist and the progressives
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:19.520]  are trying to make us submit to a monotheistic stone age religion that cuts women's genitals
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:24.400]  off and throws gays off buildings and then if you criticize it you're banned i mean pol Watson
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:30.560]  has had his youtube channel then one strike and it's the videos criticizing them murdering gay
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:36.560]  people and then the gay news sites attack me and say all these lies and defend islam it's it's
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:42.800]  like a cocking or what what is it oh well it's upside down it's insane isn't it i was talking
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:49.280]  about earlier the whole world's upside down is everything it's just like there's so many groups
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:55.280]  that put so much effort and time into attacking us and if they just put that effort and time
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:59.920]  into attacking the real fascists the real organizations instead of trying to get me banned
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:07.120]  on twitter as we said Hamas Hezbollah muslim brotherhood terrorist organizations real hate
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:14.960]  not not us not us identifying it but the real hate if they tackle that but a lot of them see
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:19.600]  the problem a lot of them see it as an alignment because they want to overthrow democracy they
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:23.920]  want to overthrow the rule of law and they say Islam is the biggest weapon to do that so they will
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:28.400]  combine with it it's not genuine because of anti fascist views it's usually to do a communism or
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:33.840]  Marxism and they want the complete destruction of the nation they hate the rule of law they hate
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:38.240]  the police and they sort of have this loose alignment even though they hate religion they have
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:43.280]  this loose alignment where we'll work together until we get there i'm not realized well i mean i see
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:47.680]  the atheist arguments against these corrupt churches and and some of the stuff they do
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:51.600]  even though i don't agree with the atheist i agree with their critique of some out of control
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:56.960]  christian groups but then the muslims are like 50 million light years worse and the pope saying
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:01.440]  there is no hell if he wants to be a leftist professor globalist go ahead but don't play
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:07.040]  in your the pope man you know it's like it's like he claims he's playing rock and roll and he's playing
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:13.040]  you know on a taker toy or with a xylophone i mean dude you're the pope you're a christian it's
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:17.280]  just every you're in and like the lady you you pointed out who's one of the main leaders
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:23.600]  against general mutilation con calls for you to be banned her to be banned and then you're both banned
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:29.040]  and all she's saying is please speak out against general mutilation in islam you're a leader please
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:36.720]  do it and because that's so real a real woman saying that they ban her i mean that is crazy
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:42.800]  and they the pope talks about open borders well you open the board you open the gates of the
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:47.840]  vacuum you open the walls of the vacuum you let them come live with you stop talking about letting
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.920]  them live with us that's what completely winds me up and what you know you're not talking about
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:58.800]  russia when we started this conversation we've had this false flag attack in the uk where a russian
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:05.840]  x-boy so an exporter to russia has been killed in our countries and so is his door and what we've
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:10.880]  seen they say they used a russian nerve agent why would russia use a russian nerve agent
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:14.480]  why don't you stab him if they want to kill him why would they use something so high-profile to
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:19.040]  get someone it's so obvious and just like the singing of the manor war propaganda or operation
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:24.240]  hemler to start world war two it's completely obvious they use a russian nerve agent they want
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:28.160]  to say that people are alive or dead and now we're told we're on the edge of world war three
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:34.880]  oh it's completely obvious absolutely that how you kill somebody is a bag over their head
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:39.120]  you come in their apartment you kill them you don't kill them on a park bench with nerve gas
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:45.680]  that's then fingerprinted back to you that is ridiculous and then our response to that so one
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:52.880]  man killed our response to russia is to expel the diplomats isis which by the way is is what you do
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:12:00.960]  before war yeah and isis isis blow up three times last year four times in our country they blow up
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:06.320]  they murdered a man they blow up little girls they blow up little girls what was our response
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:12.800]  our response was to allow 450 of their fighters back to give them houses to give them money and
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:18.960]  then now we learn a thousand that you had he rides back yet one russian's killed we expel their
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:26.400]  diplomats it's insane how now because russia is christian and how no one can see it it's like
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:32.000]  why if they wanted to kill him why would they use a russian nerve agent come on come on and when
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.760]  you see it building up and as as as an englishman i think i want to go with russia why would we want
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:42.800]  to go with the war with russia why are you trying to maneuver and then australia are getting involved
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:50.080]  by the way war with russia means the end of life on earth and i i truly believe that our brexit
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:55.040]  that the if they start a war with russia it will be the excuse they use that we're stronger together
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:59.760]  with the european you course and we need we need to stay well no no no peter southern before he died
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:04.400]  you're very astute as you read the bbc two years ago he said if you break up the uu will cause war
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:08.800]  there will be war they're saying you let us have total power we're gonna start a war with russia
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:15.280]  and then you will that you just that's what they're doing brother i can i can see it when they start

[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:43.600]  ted newton on or i just had tommy robinson on or i have ron paul on or any of these people
[02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:50.400]  they're all game changers in their area critical individuals that broke the news and were paul
[02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:55.840]  reveres and martin morano advising congress advising the senate climate depot dot com
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:59.920]  climate hustle dot org it's him and lord bonka they're the ones that without their research
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:05.360]  their doggedness we wouldn't be here and they call for his arrest in france uh you name it they try
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:10.480]  to stop this film's being shown he's got his new bestselling book uh climate change the politically
[02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:14.880]  incorrect guy to climate change we carry his film the climate hustle info or short dot com but
[02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:18.800]  and i know his this went to like what number one i was reading a few weeks going amazon but
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:22.880]  no news coverage of that doesn't matter we are the news we don't need the fake new york times
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:27.600]  and all them with their fake list to do this but he joins us to cover their latest assault
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:33.040]  the globalists to take over energy and what trump's doing and why the economy's coming back
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:38.400]  and so much more but i gotta just bring it up to you mark what do you make of trump and i was
[02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:41.600]  told this by ted newton off record he said i could talk about it today during the break we never
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:46.720]  got to it but he talked to potas and he talked to some other folks and they're like look we're gonna
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:50.320]  tell him we okay we're open your gun control so they admit they want to ban it because that's the
[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:55.920]  bills they've already got just give me a chance trump said he did it and now it's got republicans
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:22:01.440]  1015 points you know uh back up in the polls so i'm not really maxia velliam like that i can be but
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:06.320]  i'm just kind of a straight shooter i don't kind of like playing politics but uh i gotta say man
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:13.760]  trump is really is playing 40 chess yes trump is you know handling this well i get a little nervous
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:18.160]  when he starts talking about bump stocks and starts sounding uh you know a little bit appeasing
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:22.800]  because once you feed this beast the gun control beast there's no end the same thing with the climate
[02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:28.000]  climate change but trump is held steady on that and i will tell you alex what not only want to
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.640]  talk about my book today but i want to talk to you about the the parallels between this gun control
[02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:37.920]  movement and the climate change movement it is unbelievable how the gun control activists are
[02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:42.880]  borrowing from the most successful propaganda effort in history climate change and i'm talking
[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:48.880]  about the use of kits indoctrinating them as young as possible involving them in lawsuits against the
[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:53.520]  government to force government action i'm talking about the way they get funded i'm talking about
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:58.400]  the way they bypass and want to alter the constitution in order to get their agenda the climate
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:04.000]  control will call them climate control activists and the gun control activists are in complete
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:09.200]  harmony but the gun control activists are copying a very successful strategy from the climate change
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:14.240]  activists and trump has been pretty solid on both no i agree and i don't like the rhetoric either
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:18.000]  it's just that was the strategy to get them to come out and admit they wanted all of what it's
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.640]  really about yeah he sort of he sort of drew him out especially and and it's funny to see the mainstream
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:27.440]  media denying that the former uh supreme court justice actually said what he said and they're
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:31.360]  still doing that they're still saying oh he didn't mean that but it's one of the greatest things we
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:37.440]  could have to turn this debate back on them they want to quantify first it was global freezing
[02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:40.560]  thing global warming now they say change well everybody knows there's change they say we're
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:45.200]  denying change no we're we're denying that humans are what controls everything and that paying all
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:50.800]  more tax money is going to save us but as you said marxist communist uh authoritarian hitler
[02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:56.160]  people said oh don't criticize that you know the gun marchers uh because they're connected to hitler
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:03.040]  well soros was a nazi collaborator uh the youth movements are very fascistic generally or or
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:08.160]  Maoistic communist and so i think that's totally fair to draw those parallels you're right that's
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:13.920]  what they're doing mark marino of climate depot dot com they are following the famous authoritarian
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:20.960]  model they absolutely are from and interestingly enough that they they've always tried to conceal
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.040]  their real agenda the same way the climate activists have as well the climate activists and in the book
[02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:29.600]  the politically incorrect guy to climate change i openly have all the documentation and the exact
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:33.760]  quotes them saying this isn't about the climate this isn't about environmental policy it's about
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:38.880]  redistribution of wealth global governance central power the un climate chief actually says in my
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:43.360]  book i interviewed her she actually says we seek a centralized transformation that will make life on
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:48.640]  planet earth very different now flip that over to the gun control debate they've always they haven't
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:53.600]  been that honest until recently and you're right maybe trump drew this out by getting them all you
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:58.160]  know by getting them more candid but they try to say oh it's just we just need this gun safety
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:03.280]  measure we just need this one thing but now we've drawn the gun control advocates into admitting
[02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:07.920]  they want to get rid of and completely eliminate the second amendment so it's the exact same thing
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:14.000]  they conceal their real agenda and the real agenda is completely nothing to do with the actual issue
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.760]  is that nothing to do with the school shooting because this is they're using and exploiting
[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:22.880]  children the same way they do in climate they do that in the gun control debate well the leading
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:28.240]  experts then that advises the senate quantify what the in-game is i know you know a lot of people know
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:34.800]  but quantifying what is their in-game if they had their cake and what is their next salvo their next
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:40.160]  rollout well as you've been saying here i actually traveled to the check republic to interview former
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:46.320]  check president valkalov clause in person and he said having grown up under the soviet eastern block
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:52.160]  domination since the fall of the soviet union in the eastern block the greatest threat we face today
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:58.800]  is what he calls ambitious environmentalism or the global warming agenda they are going after
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:04.080]  every aspect of our lives from dishwashers to light bulbs to transportation to our diet
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:10.240]  to our lifestyles to our home energy used to our vehicles to our sovereignty and this is their
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:15.760]  agenda it's the same agenda in the book alex i actually go back to the overpopulation scare the
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:21.440]  resource scarcity scare the global cooling scare and i show that no matter what environmental
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:27.680]  crisis that they had the solution was always the same including in the 1960s and 70s and that solution
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:33.360]  global governance wealth redistribution central planning and i go back same same solution different
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.640]  environmental scare and i show it over and over there's no way you can look at the overwhelming
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:43.280]  evidence and assume for a minute that they're actually worried about the climate and in the
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:47.280]  modern day thing with gun control that they're actually worried about the safety of children
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:52.000]  has nothing to do with it this is about their agenda how they can mask it how they can move it
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:57.520]  forward and they are frighteningly similar the climate climate change activists and the gun
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:00.960]  control activists absolutely they've already disarmed everybody else around the world except
[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:06.480]  for switzerland the us so when we talk about the global carbon tax the system to regulate it and
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:11.280]  track it this is their big inch a lot of this is world government funding so we blow this up
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:17.200]  uh we save the planet and and trump has delivered and look at only 1450 months in office how the
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:22.480]  economy turned around just because they took the restraints off just a little bit i mean well
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:28.160]  i mean that's really proof of life proof of concept i want to say one thing and colter has
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:32.560]  been making no sense to me going around saying that donald trump has disappointed her xy
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:37.840]  compare donald trump she is just she is just grandstanding man she's turned into a total
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:42.480]  why didn't she go bite the head off chickens at the damn fair if she wants attention she's a geek
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.520]  but someone someone needs to ask her a simple but compare her to how a president mit romney

[02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:28.240]  you know it's kind of narcissistic that we come into each segment go alex jones but that's how
[02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:32.400]  arbitration ratings work for radio radio stations want you to do that so that's kind of this is a
[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:37.120]  radio show that grew into a tv show that grew into a tv network that grew into the second
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:43.680]  american revolution but that's why we do that but uh getting serious here the left always
[02:33:43.680 --> 02:33:51.680]  build themselves as the saviors and if you study their antecedents their fount their
[02:33:51.680 --> 02:34:05.840]  progeneration their origination their proto prime evil development they come out of the jackabins
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:11.520]  in france and if you go read mainline history books they were devil worshipers that wanted a
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:18.080]  nine-day work week total enslavement to have sex with children basically hollywood and
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:23.840]  and it's great to have word moncton he's a big story he knows all about this and he'll get into
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:31.920]  all of but that's where it goes so you wonder it's just about maximum power for elites so you
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:36.560]  have free market capitalism you have crony globalist capitalism it's against that you have the
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:41.120]  democrats that have 70 plus percent of the wealth in congress but they're always trying to create
[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:45.280]  this culture war and want to transfer wealth what they want is a tax on everything you do
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:51.840]  and the surveillance of that to track and control it and then exempt themselves like china and india
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:56.400]  exempt were not so trump says that's a screw job i'm not doing that and mark marino who was hugely
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:02.000]  critical of republicans says wow that's really great that alone puts trump up there in lights
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:08.080]  someone back to mark marino the left always builds themselves as the saviors but if you
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:12.240]  look at the countries everybody's trying to get into it's the places that least have quasi free
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:18.000]  market and they're not one level above them they're it's a whole other universe of better
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.560]  and bernie sanders is like i don't like the fact you can get a thousand different doctors
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:27.760]  and 30 types of the over it's confusing my honeymoon was in the soviet union that's a real quote
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:34.480]  and you're like wow and he tells a bunch of idiot college students who have all these choices that
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:39.760]  the west is bad as they try to wreck it as quickly as possible so that's their plan to have a
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:43.840]  managed economy as you mentioned in your book you have the documents they admit this all
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:48.320]  the politically correct guy to climate change won't talk about that so looking at them they
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:52.960]  build themselves as a savior of the earth but it's really a eugenics based transhumanist
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:59.520]  post industrial world model of feudalism in their own words and so really those of us fighting them
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:03.600]  are not trying to be saviors of the earth we're just trying to not live in a giant
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:08.320]  high-tech gulag so can you get into their ideology and get into how we're going to stop
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:14.320]  at martin reino well as the greenpeace co-founder patrick morris says who's turned against greenpeace
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:19.520]  it is the most anti-human ideology today the climate agenda modern environmental movement
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:26.160]  in the book i have a little notice quote from al gore at a bill gates event talking about how
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:31.600]  africa is projected to have the hugest population explosion in the in the 21st century and you
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:37.200]  know what al gore's solution is quote ubiquitous fertility management because there's going to
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:41.680]  be too many people of color in the world now the quote was ubiquitous fertility management
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.080]  but we have a white wealthy western politician lamenting that there's going to be too many
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:52.960]  africans and the solution is to get rid of them with ubiquitous fertility management unquote
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:58.640]  this is their agenda and this is not you know how does al gore get away with that can you imagine
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:03.120]  out of donald trump the media letting him get away with saying there's going to be too many black
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:09.120]  people too many africans we've got to limit their population in order to save the earth this is their
[02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:15.120]  agenda their agenda goes we have a document in the book how even in africa where they have no
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:22.000]  running water no electricity they use the rivers for sewers they burn dung and uh and and wood in
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:27.760]  their in their huts and they're breathing in horrible pollution they're being denied modern
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:32.160]  cheap fossil fuel energy because the earth can't handle it they're not allowed to make
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:37.920]  the west mistake the wealthy country's mistakes this is immoral i interviewed uh governor of
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:43.440]  california jerry brown saying the developing world in africa and south america can't emulate the
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:48.240]  united states united states capitalism and prosperity because you know obama told africa
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:54.560]  you can't have america disding your cars that's right unless unless it's done by the way the by
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:59.920]  essentially white wealthy westerners managing it and obama's administration was very detrimental
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:04.720]  to africa prevented many coal plants from going online i document that in the book as well oh
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:09.280]  yeah the answer to africa's population explosion because it is more popular in some areas is we
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:15.360]  know 1000 percent from japan to idland everywhere you industrialize population growth drops to 1.3
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:22.960]  1.4 we would have a african population decline instead of a giant islamic bloom and invasion
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:26.800]  i'm all for there being more africans just don't be foaming at the mouth africans with
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:33.040]  you with knives in your teeth coming across on soros boats to slit our throats well what's
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:37.600]  happening in africa is you're exactly right with the development part they when they get development
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:42.160]  their population would stabilize and ultimately decline the only reason some european countries
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:48.240]  are all the influx of immigration but it is amazing what development and prosperity does
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:52.800]  to human beings it cleans up the environment that's the perverse thing fossil fuels actually
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:57.200]  clean up it cleans up your rivers it cleans up your air they don't mention that the other thing
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:02.560]  they do they make all these scary predictions to bring everyone in you i document how paul erlich
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:09.120]  the 1960s over population he was compared to quote just like hitler by contemporaries in 1960s
[02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:14.640]  he wanted to put uh sterilization agents in the water that's what i'm getting at is that
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:20.720]  the left goes and weaponizes africa and makes them hate the west then soros opens it up lets islam
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:26.640]  and with obama grow and take over africa and then use the giant blooming population to then come
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:30.800]  in to quote conquer europe in a race-based system instead of everybody just working together this
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:36.080]  is the most diabolical evil and really that's what it is bill gates al gore the globalist are
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:40.960]  you know the democrats are the maddest they've been at trump right now since slavery ended i mean
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:46.080]  i mean that's really true they're the ones and it's true they they're just race-based because
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:51.360]  they're cold-blooded and how do we get the average leftist to understand how they've been conned
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:56.320]  well that's part of the thing now one of that what i try to do in the book is i feature
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:01.280]  left-wing scientists scientists who are committed environmentalists i feature scientists who voted
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:06.480]  for al gore i think he's a smart man would vote for al gore for president again but they're appalled
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:11.440]  at his science presentation they're appalled to what they see as global warming hijacking real
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:17.360]  environmental issues like clean air clean water cleaning up areas they think that global warming
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:22.720]  is one of the most anti-environmental issues and i try to profile these politically left-wing
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:28.000]  scientists in order to make it okay for other left-wing activists to realize the error of their
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:34.080]  ways i feature united nation scientists who turned against the un and openly admit and this is one
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:38.000]  of the funny things in the book i was they actually behind the scenes in the un talk about
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.720]  will make the next report so alarming the world will have to act they talk about how they have to
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:47.680]  get rid of the medieval warm period because they if we have one if they acknowledge it then they
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:53.520]  can't explain current warrants because we had a medieval warm period uh you know 800 years ago
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:57.840]  simply because we didn't and we had a medieval warm period without benefit of coal plants and
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:04.080]  suvs so they they talk openly about altering the data i go through all of this in the book so even
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:08.960]  left-wing activists the hope is not that they're going to change their ways but that they'll abandon
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:13.360]  the climate movement as they abandon the over population movement the global cooling movement
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:17.760]  the amazon deforestation movement the resource scarcity movement all the previous environmental
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:21.760]  scares have eventually been abandoned because they were unscientifically untenable and we're
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:30.080]  reaching that tipping point with global warming well mark morano we know the collectives want to
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:34.480]  manage and control humanity it's it's what they crave free market libertarians we just crave turning
[02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:40.080]  humanity loose uh and and history's replete i mean as you know in venezuela they long ago ate
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:44.240]  their dogs and cats now it's cannibalism and the government won't let you say thousands die a week
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:49.840]  for starvation i just look at the average college students and i'm not trying to be mean they look
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:54.400]  like they've been beat upside the head with a lobotomy scalpel and i just don't know what we're
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:42:00.480]  going to do because uh there's something about dumb people they hate civilization they hate
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:05.200]  electricity they hate the light they hate they see it as like a threat so they try to pull it down
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:10.720]  and then starve to death and they're so dumb they don't know why they starved to death yeah and we
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:15.360]  have i mean we have a collegiate organization called collegiates for constructive tomorrow
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:21.280]  we've noticed just in the last five years college kids coming up have been so indoctrinated in this
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:25.680]  agenda of the climate change and environmental that they are now you know different from college
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:29.680]  kids five years ago i mean it's working from kindergarten to college when you start this
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:34.560]  indoctrination and i feature lean on her to caprio in the book saying you got to get kids young

[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:32.960]  by the way everybody that listens knows that i don't like to say hey this is coming up then build
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:39.200]  it up i don't just get right to it we've got so much we haven't gotten to but the ted nugent thing
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:44.160]  i've met ted known ted he's been on for 16 17 years love what he does but i went out to his house his
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:48.640]  wife's so cool the natural lightness house is so great we're over there like two and a half hours
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:51.920]  and then we spent like three weeks putting this video together it's like an hour and a half long
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:59.200]  and i said in the meetings and then you know 10 a.m at a launch it'll be on info wars we'll have
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:03.360]  the video we can promote everybody we'll play excerpts on the show we'll have ted nugent on
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:07.600]  and it wasn't kind of ready last week so i said oh let's just move it to next week
[02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:13.440]  but i'm not mad at anybody it's these patterns because the bigger the production
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:17.680]  the more it airs on friday
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:27.360]  or the more it just never gets ready and then we always post it like five and no one twitter's it
[02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:32.240]  or no one facebook's it and just it's like the bigger and more important it's like just it's
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:42.640]  thrown to the side it's not this time because i realized that it wasn't done for uploading everything
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:46.800]  which is fine it's fine because here's the other something at my house they get some million views
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:50.960]  i do some big ted nugent production and you know it gets 500 000 views and he comes on the show it's
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:55.200]  two million views it's like you never know but i it's important video so i want to build it up
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:59.440]  and then i realized i said okay move it to tomorrow now so we'll air on the show and
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:02.560]  upload it so i can say it's on the side everybody can tweet it and facebook it
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:06.160]  and i went oh my god i just did it to myself again friday the dead zone
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:12.320]  so we're gonna air it next week i'm gonna call ted as he's waiting to hear it wants to see it
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:16.080]  and i'm gonna say oh sorry we decided to push it to next week to get even more promotion
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:22.160]  but i think a meteor may hit the office before that happens i'm serious i mean i i i don't think
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:27.600]  we could air that sucker and have it on the website at 7 a.m and promote it and have it and do it i
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:33.280]  don't think we can because i've noticed that if something had time and energy put into it
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:40.640]  trash can that sucker but my son goes i want to come up and challenge hog and boom we don't think
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:46.560]  about it goes right out viral everywhere you know total victory so i'm just trying to figure out the
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:53.440]  the it's like some theory i've got about interspatial dimensional fields or something where
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:50:00.160]  if you care about something and you do a bunch of work on it it can't air and then no one works
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:07.520]  together and then no one communicates and that's why i've just got a gun gun gun gun live because
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:13.680]  gunning it out live on radio and tv and forcing people into the clock and forcing into that live
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:20.480]  stream is everything because then you get victory then you get what's real then you're on air then
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:26.240]  you talk to people then you can jam it down the globalist throats instead of deadling and pouring
[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:29.120]  and schmickle grooving and whatever you want to call it
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:49.840]  this is crazy so crazy it's coordination and the globalists are coordinated if we get coordinated
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:53.920]  and don't just talk on our phones or tweet or you know sit there like everybody's like talking
[02:50:53.920 --> 02:51:00.400]  constantly but not actually coordinating if we coordinate as free peoples and start realizing
[02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:10.320]  that we're in a war we're gonna win if we don't recruit so that's it sometime maybe hey three weeks
[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:14.000]  from now i'm gonna air the ted news you know that sound and i'm gonna air it on a wednesday
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:20.000]  and that's the way it's gonna be now all right there you go thank you okay uh anyways getting

[02:52:36.560 --> 02:52:41.040]  i did not i gave him a few ideas but uh and a few of my ideas are in there but i'm really proud
[02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:45.600]  of my 15 year old son people don't believe he's 15 you saw him in person he's already bigger than i
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:52.720]  am no he's 15 and uh i'm really proud of him so here is rex jones challenging jordan soros's pitch
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:58.720]  man david hog to a debate hello mr hog my name is rex jones and i want to make a public statement
[02:52:58.720 --> 02:53:04.320]  about you claiming to speak for my generation about guns if you listen real close you can
[02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:10.560]  hear the people in power shaking they've gotten used to being protective of their position
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:20.720]  chewing safety the safety of inaction inaction is no longer safe and to that we say no more hog
[02:53:20.720 --> 02:53:26.080]  you claim that the establishment is shaking in its boots in fear of you no they love you
[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:32.720]  they love gun control they've wanted this for years if i could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of
[02:53:32.720 --> 02:53:40.720]  the united states for an outright ban picking up every one of them mr and mrs america turn them
[02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:46.800]  all in i would have done it here's the legislation that you supported in georgia uh the the last
[02:53:46.800 --> 02:53:50.800]  assault weapons ban democrats in your state push and i'm quoting from the legislation right here
[02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:56.880]  the georgia bureau of investigations shall seize and take possession possession of any assault
[02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:02.240]  weapon large capacity magazine armor piercer bullet were incendiary 50 caliber bullet shall
[02:54:02.240 --> 02:54:07.520]  seize and take possession of it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a monday and then
[02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:12.480]  only do it every monday we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people
[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:18.160]  into thinking about guns in a vastly different way you've heard people say you'll have to pry my
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:29.920]  gun for my whole day okay it is admitted they want to disarm the american people just as they have
[02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:35.200]  done with so many corrupt regimes in the past hitler solin mao north korea do you think those
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:39.520]  places you think those corrupt leaders allowed their citizens to have guns do you think the jews
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:44.080]  were able to protect themselves when hitler put them in concentration camps no they were disarmed
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:49.760]  and that's why they were enslaved hog you're a public figure and you call my dad a piece of shi
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:54.320]  you know what and you say all kinds of other horrible things you've challenged him to a debate
[02:54:54.320 --> 02:54:58.160]  and then backed out of it the fact is you and your fellow students have been handpicked by the
[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:02.080]  mainstream media to misrepresent the american people and make it look like the average young
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:07.280]  american teen wants to have their first and second amendment taken away many people in your name
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:11.680]  such as cnn have called for my father to band off youtube and claim that it's bullying to say
[02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:16.480]  that it's authoritarianism to repeal the second amendment mainstream media uses you as a child
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:20.240]  human shield so that you can go out and make outrageous statements without anyone being
[02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:26.160]  allowed to rebut you without being labeled a bully the truth is mr hog the george soros and the groups
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:31.280]  funding your anti-gun march are a clear and present danger to this country and draw clear
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:38.960]  parallels to nazi germany in the authoritarian regimes of the past well david hog here we are
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:43.360]  we're at the peace officers memorial in downtown austin these brave men and women took an oath to
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:50.560]  uphold the constitution the sheriff in your state did too but he didn't protect y'all he stayed outside
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:54.960]  while the massacre happened and you like to blame that on guns i say we shouldn't blame that on
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:56:01.120]  guns we should blame it on the sheriff that failed to act but no you make apologies for him you said
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:07.360]  that going down a barrel of an ar-15 is dangerous and you understood why he was scared going down
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:13.280]  the barrel of an ar-15 is that man's job and for you to make apologies for him it's absolutely
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:20.080]  disgusting the veterans who died in the revolutionary war and the war of 1812 they died to protect
[02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:25.040]  this country from the british they died to protect their civil rights in world war two and world war
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:32.000]  one american soldiers went across the globe to protect our freedoms you say that those freedoms
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:40.080]  are obsolete that no one needs a weapon of war were you taught in school david hog about how
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:45.280]  our country was founded were you taught in school that lexington and concord the british came for
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:50.080]  our firearms and our weapons and we said no and we defended our country with all of our might and
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:55.200]  strength and that's how we became the most free the most prosperous and the most successful nation
[02:56:55.200 --> 02:57:01.760]  on earth to the date do you know how that happened brave men and women like the men and women behind
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:08.160]  me stood up and they said no we will not submit to tyranny and that is what you were doing you
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:12.400]  were submitting to tyranny you were begging to have the rights that our forefathers fought for
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:19.760]  stripped away you say yes please take my rights i say no you're not going to take my rights well
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:25.200]  i'm 15 years old mr hog and i don't need talking points or a little teleprompter behind my cnn
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:30.160]  interview screen to get my point across i'm backed up by statistics and facts you were backed up by
[02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:36.880]  falsities and lies mr hog my dad publicly invited you to come on his show and debate him you shied
[02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:42.000]  away and crawled back under your rock i rex zones would like to publicly challenge you to debate me
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:47.520]  name the time name the place name the venue i will do it info war's life is bringing you a breakthrough
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:53.760]  in modern medicine introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:59.680]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[02:57:59.680 --> 02:58:06.800]  eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate
[02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:12.480]  certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:17.840]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research

[03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:21.680]  to alex jones
[03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:31.680]  man i walked into an alice Cooper concert i was about 14 the song was playing and it sounded so
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:36.960]  good it was better than on the radio
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:43.920]  i'm a boy and i'm a man
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:50.480]  and then about four years ago it was chain steiner and uh pat riley and some other folks and i walked
[03:00:50.480 --> 03:00:54.800]  in it was the same thing it was like wait a minute deja vu i walked in late to a concert when i was
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:58.880]  14 years old this song was playing i guess he probably plays them the same order and he was
[03:00:58.880 --> 03:01:04.560]  playing this song i was like what here i am 30 years later or whatever and it it's happening
[03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:18.640]  i got a baby's brain and an old man's heart it took eight years to get this far
[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:24.160]  don't always know what i'm talking about
[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:30.160]  it feels like i'm living in the middle of doubt because i'm 18
[03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:40.320]  18 i just don't know what to say for me 18 was about 12
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:47.120]  like rex looks like he's about 16 17 18 19 people don't believe he's 15
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:53.120]  and he's a young 15 people thought i was like 20 when i was like 13 this crazy
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:59.520]  thing i uh i'm not gonna get any stories pretty ridiculous but i'm gonna stop right there
[03:01:59.520 --> 03:02:03.280]  anyways ever write a memoir though it'll be pretty interesting because it'll all be true
[03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:06.960]  but it'll all be unbelievable but look at what we do currently it's all unbelievable
[03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:17.200]  reality is unbelievable we'll stop right there um got a bunch of phone calls that i should go to
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:20.880]  we give the number out that's always a good thing to do take your phone calls i haven't done that
[03:02:20.880 --> 03:02:23.760]  today but i got a little bit better this week we've taken calls the last three days i was
[03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:29.200]  taking calls today doug hagman's coming up i'm not here trying to like space the time out
[03:02:30.320 --> 03:02:36.480]  because it's already time for doug hagman to take over um the russian news is so horrible
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:41.760]  that you know it's kind of like you're going to visit grandma and she's in a coma on her
[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:47.200]  they've already defibrillated her a couple times and she's probably gonna die and you kind of go
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:52.480]  back to your hotel room at night but the hospital and you kind of halfway hope you're not there when
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:03:00.560]  she dies even though you love grandma except if we die it's the whole plan and so i'll admit it i'm
[03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:09.280]  kind of a wimp i've i i look at the russian situation and it's real and i know the global
[03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:12.960]  is starting what their plans are and now they sold us out in the communist chinese
[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:21.600]  and i just want to go to a sports bar and eat a chicken fry steak and get drunk but i'm not
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:29.760]  going to do that and then this happens i get really mad at the left and the globalists and all
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:34.080]  them because they're the ones trying to overthrow the country and the family and god the globalist
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:38.720]  pope saying there is no hell and you know people shouldn't be christians and we should he said that
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:45.440]  he said it makes you nauseous to hear about europe's christian roots and it's like wow what would
[03:03:45.440 --> 03:03:51.120]  happen if they had a total globalist as the pope well there it is that drudge report headline
[03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:57.760]  today we maybe it's still up but then there's the goodness and i i always get frustrated after i go
[03:03:57.760 --> 03:04:04.720]  off there because i meant to come in here today and lead the broadcast with my gut tells me but
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:08.960]  also intellectually trumps the real deal and he's not an instant gratification he's not a dictator
[03:04:08.960 --> 03:04:16.320]  he's not perfect but man 30 billion loss from amazon when that is an anti-american globalist
[03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:20.640]  company and they are screwing this nation over and they have got a dollar forty eight every
[03:04:20.640 --> 03:04:24.960]  package nobody else gets and they've got all these other tax incentives that obama and
[03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:28.720]  clinton set up and if they want to fund the washington post try to bring this country down
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:36.720]  i say break their neck politically and he's doing it so it's true the storms here
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:41.840]  trumps going after him and this is a hell of a time to be alive we'll be back to play a clip of
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:46.720]  trump with some huge russia statements straight ahead and then we're going to bring doug hagman in
[03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:56.960]  with all of his critical intel stay with us we need to fund this operation ladies and gentlemen
[03:04:56.960 --> 03:05:01.840]  and i make it really easy we went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are
[03:05:01.840 --> 03:05:08.640]  that are healthy for energy stamina mental clarity you name it and we created a stronger formula than
[03:05:08.640 --> 03:05:12.240]  some of the best-selling formulas out there it's very simple we went out and like look what is the
[03:05:12.240 --> 03:05:16.320]  top what is the best we'll just put even more product in we'll make it better leading competitors
[03:05:16.320 --> 03:05:21.840]  but two dollars a product in it sell it for 60 bucks we put $10 in it and sell it for 30 bucks
[03:05:21.840 --> 03:05:29.600]  it's 1995 right now so you get an incredible top of the line new tropic for 1995 believe me we're
[03:05:29.600 --> 03:05:34.480]  selling it for 35 on average we need that 15 20 bucks we make to fund this operation in the face
[03:05:34.480 --> 03:05:39.120]  of the global threat of it but i'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks
[03:05:39.120 --> 03:05:43.760]  i want to shell it all out before the big supply comes in and i want people that haven't tried

[03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:14.240]  it's all coming out in the uk it's all coming out here how dare them attack us it's not about us
[03:14:14.240 --> 03:14:22.720]  it's about the children this is going on alexa crawley killed his own son exactly and and you
[03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:28.240]  go back to the crawley era and you go back to that uh uh that that desert to time shall we say
[03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:32.080]  and then move forward to rosemary's baby and beyond and you can see the foundation that was
[03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:36.800]  being laid now to marina removic or whatever however you pronounce her last name and how that
[03:14:36.800 --> 03:14:43.040]  is infiltrated and incestuously so all of the power circles in washington as well as hollywood
[03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:48.720]  new york so you've got this this a force multiplier that being the spirit cooking in in such taking
[03:14:48.720 --> 03:14:55.040]  place and of course the politicians really isn't a way to compromise people oh look epstein
[03:14:55.760 --> 03:15:02.480]  roles of videotape as we used to say but but uh now you know the server's full of of compromising
[03:15:02.480 --> 03:15:09.200]  pictures documentation and look what reneer did to subjugate his his sex slaves he uh
[03:15:09.920 --> 03:15:16.640]  forced confessions out of them or obtained compromising photographs so this is this is
[03:15:16.640 --> 03:15:23.520]  kind of a a template for the the power brokers the deep state individuals so we're the

[03:20:21.200 --> 03:20:23.440]  it's alex jones
[03:20:27.920 --> 03:20:32.880]  dug hagman sitting in for alex jones dug hagman from hagman report hagman report dot com but
[03:20:32.880 --> 03:20:37.520]  most importantly right now sitting in for alex and a couple of the stories right out of the gate
[03:20:38.240 --> 03:20:43.440]  especially in including i think one of the most important stories that uh that was referenced
[03:20:43.440 --> 03:20:49.600]  today and of course is that info wars dot com and that's the fact that the hollywood sex cult of
[03:20:49.600 --> 03:20:56.080]  keith renear there's been there have been warnings upon warnings upon warnings about this for years
[03:20:56.080 --> 03:21:05.600]  the um that specific cult nxiv m group that was out of new york albany and points east and and of
[03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:11.040]  course uh then it transitioned into hollywood or to hollywood and caught up a number of
[03:21:11.760 --> 03:21:17.760]  actors actresses specifically and then from their politicians leaders and and you're looking at
[03:21:17.760 --> 03:21:24.240]  keith renear the co-founder of this controversial self-help group this multi-level kind of obscure
[03:21:24.240 --> 03:21:32.800]  oblique marketing group known as nxiv m being arrested in mexico for sex trafficking and
[03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:39.200]  forced labor conspiracy now the only thing i can come out with and say about this is
[03:21:39.200 --> 03:21:45.280]  didn't we tell you didn't we say this didn't we warn about this how many months ago and of
[03:21:45.280 --> 03:21:52.480]  course our warnings uh countered by such illuminous groups like snopes dot com and other places i won't
[03:21:52.480 --> 03:22:00.000]  even mention and the hit pieces that that in the attacks that were that were uh launched out against
[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:06.400]  us alex jones info wars doug agman and others it was just ridiculous that this doesn't exist the
[03:22:06.400 --> 03:22:10.960]  sex trafficking doesn't exist well let me tell you something you get you talk to people you
[03:22:10.960 --> 03:22:16.880]  interview people such as uh craigsaw menssoyer and others who will say that the children are the
[03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:25.440]  currency of the globalists and the pedigree it's all for real and it's interesting how we can see
[03:22:25.440 --> 03:22:32.240]  when things like this happen there's always the action in reaction and there's always this blowback
[03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:39.920]  that we have we we see so the we're seeing it with miller we're seeing it with a number of it
[03:22:39.920 --> 03:22:47.760]  really across the board yeah you go in you expose the the nefarious deeds of the globalists they
[03:22:48.320 --> 03:22:54.160]  punch you back then you go back in and you double down and they punch you back twice as hard so this
[03:22:54.160 --> 03:23:00.720]  is what we're seeing so just just kind of bring a wide lens out on this uh what we're seeing and
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:07.040]  what we've been seeing since donald trump was put in the office or elected into office is this constant
[03:23:07.040 --> 03:23:12.960]  fight this constant exposure of the deeds of darkness that include the globalists that include
[03:23:12.960 --> 03:23:19.120]  some of the people within our own government who traffic in sexual uh trafficking children and
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:25.200]  engage in these these sexual perversions and and again we see this now coming out and being verified
[03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:32.640]  through the arrest of geese reneer and complete in this article and go to info wars.com please
[03:23:32.640 --> 03:23:39.600]  understand and read and research this for yourself because this is not some sort of obscure conspiracy
[03:23:40.640 --> 03:23:48.320]  comma theory and the commas intentional there uh this is more of verification this is more
[03:23:48.320 --> 03:23:53.680]  verification and think back to what we had talked about go back to the podesta emails do you remember
[03:23:53.680 --> 03:24:01.440]  those oh yeah well when podesta obviously uh in the email his emails were were phished and of course
[03:24:01.440 --> 03:24:08.240]  were published at wiki leaks john podesta invited to spirit cooking dinner and then marina abramova
[03:24:08.240 --> 03:24:13.840]  came in and then you had a whole slew of citizen investigators and researchers talking uh in
[03:24:13.840 --> 03:24:21.680]  exposing these deeds and then tony podesta the the interesting art now it look it's not it's it's
[03:24:21.680 --> 03:24:28.560]  it might be of questionable taste to have art that uh is displayed in one's home and specifically
[03:24:28.560 --> 03:24:33.920]  and that was seen in tony podesta's home i i suppose there's nothing illegal about that but
[03:24:33.920 --> 03:24:38.480]  definitely questionable in terms of their their taste but at the end of the day what does this all
[03:24:38.480 --> 03:24:47.040]  mean uh i often talk about the information that we've collected over the months and over the years
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:56.400]  if you look at a if you would consider this to be a courtroom case consider walking in for example
[03:24:56.400 --> 03:25:02.960]  with a oh you know a rope from from my boat launch will say from a boat you know those really thick
[03:25:02.960 --> 03:25:11.600]  ropes and did you ever take a good look at the end of the rope it's it's really a cluster of multiple
[03:25:11.600 --> 03:25:18.000]  fibers and each strand of that rope is a piece of evidence circumstantial perhaps but nonetheless
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:22.800]  evidence so one strand by itself yeah it's not going to hold a boat and it's not going to really
[03:25:22.800 --> 03:25:28.560]  do much two strands it makes a little bit stronger the case a little bit stronger
[03:25:28.560 --> 03:25:35.440]  five strands and multiply that until you have a sizeable a sizeable rope that will hold your
[03:25:35.440 --> 03:25:43.280]  craft your boat and that of course is the court case or the evidence so it's it's easy for the
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:48.240]  globalist it's easy for the progressive fascists the liberal fascists on the left to say you know
[03:25:48.240 --> 03:25:54.560]  what this is a bunch of conspiracy theory nonsense you know remember pedigree that that in other
[03:25:54.560 --> 03:26:01.760]  others name like that that's all conspiracy wait a second when you look at one strand
[03:26:01.760 --> 03:26:06.560]  you can say that when you have two strands not so much and multiple strands and that make the
[03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:11.760]  entire rope it's very difficult to break that rope and that's what we're dealing with here
[03:26:11.760 --> 03:26:19.360]  the multiple strands all together making the case against people such as the the individual that
[03:26:19.360 --> 03:26:25.200]  was roasted Keith Renear and how that how deeply they are entrenched now of course the response
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:29.600]  here with respect to Renear the Hollywood sex cult connected to Clintons and the Democrats
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:34.400]  they'll say wait a minute he's just merely he's just merely a supporter and and that that's going
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:38.960]  to be their their comeback and as a matter of fact it already is he just merely supported our
[03:26:38.960 --> 03:26:45.440]  campaign we have nothing to do with them that sounds good at its face but deeper research will
[03:26:45.440 --> 03:26:50.560]  indicate otherwise when you start looking at the communications again another strand of that that
[03:26:50.560 --> 03:26:58.800]  bigger rope and add the the strands one by one by one so you're able to take that that big rope
[03:26:58.800 --> 03:27:03.040]  that'll hold the boat to the dock into the courtroom and say here you go here is the
[03:27:03.040 --> 03:27:08.080]  collection of evidence so here's the bottom line in this and this is as much as I'm going to spend
[03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:17.760]  talking about this sex cult here's the bottom line the number of rest for pedophilia pedophile
[03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:24.000]  human trafficking sex trafficking trafficking and young girls as distasteful as this is by the way
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:27.760]  I've got so many conservatives and so many conservative Christians saying oh I don't really
[03:27:27.760 --> 03:27:33.840]  want to talk about this it's really it disturbs me well it should disturb you it most certainly
[03:27:33.840 --> 03:27:41.280]  should disturb you but we have to talk about it because it is real and the bottom line is is the
[03:27:41.280 --> 03:27:48.480]  fight the exposure how we are winning this war against these perverse globalists that deal
[03:27:48.480 --> 03:27:53.920]  in and children the sex objects and of course the currency for the globalist how we're winning this
[03:27:53.920 --> 03:28:01.280]  is through exposure in the and and of course the more that we expose their crimes the more they will
[03:28:01.280 --> 03:28:07.520]  dig and and run away and run in we are catching up to him Keith Renear now is is going to be
[03:28:07.520 --> 03:28:13.200]  extradited to the eastern district of New York for for trial I believe it is I believe they're
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:18.880]  the extradition is already in progress if not it will be shortly so this is going to break and
[03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:24.240]  believe me these people will talk I'm not saying he will but I'm saying people that are put in that
[03:28:24.240 --> 03:28:30.160]  position they will talk and they will start to talk on others so what you what you expected a year

[03:34:52.320 --> 03:34:57.600]  who are uh fighting the left i suppose if you are not if you're thinking well we're the globalist
[03:34:57.600 --> 03:35:02.160]  well it's the progressive left or the people who are attempting to take away the second amendment
[03:35:02.160 --> 03:35:05.680]  rights of americans and the first amendment rights of americans and and i do hope that you
[03:35:05.680 --> 03:35:10.080]  paid attention during the show because there was a lot of good conversation with respect to
[03:35:10.080 --> 03:35:15.280]  the tactics of the left the progressive left we are in the crosshairs alexios is on the crosshairs
[03:35:15.280 --> 03:35:19.120]  we're in the crosshairs of these leftist progressive liberal fascists and they want to
[03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:25.600]  they're not just coming for guns they're coming for us this is an extermination type of an event
[03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:29.680]  taking place right now and if you didn't catch this earlier i was talking about with my friend
[03:35:29.680 --> 03:35:37.120]  steve quayle uh earlier today steve was on with david night this morning on in fours uh and and
[03:35:37.120 --> 03:35:41.840]  they were talking about transhumanism and a number of other things this is what steve quayle
[03:35:41.840 --> 03:35:46.880]  and alexios were talking about years ago and they were laughed at now it's coming to pass so
[03:35:46.880 --> 03:35:52.240]  definitely catch the steve quayle on on with david night from this morning the reason i mention
[03:35:52.240 --> 03:36:00.880]  this is all of these dots connect all of these puzzle pieces fit together last thing when i talked
[03:36:00.880 --> 03:36:06.800]  about the rope i talked about a rope being a really actually a bunch of strands connected
[03:36:06.800 --> 03:36:12.000]  together in the stronger the more strange you have the bigger the the stronger the rope is
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:16.480]  and you could consider each strand a bit of evidence whether it's circumstantial direct
[03:36:16.480 --> 03:36:22.160]  or whatever kind of evidence and and at the end of the day how big that rope is will tell you how
[03:36:22.160 --> 03:36:28.720]  big of a case you've got now every rope i've seen and i use that metaphorically of course uh from
[03:36:28.720 --> 03:36:34.320]  the uh in fours reporting from the reporters from owens shroyer david night everyone else
[03:36:34.320 --> 03:36:38.800]  every single rope i've seen brought to the courtroom and the courtroom of course would be
[03:36:38.800 --> 03:36:46.080]  you and near the jury has been really strong and uh so i said all that just to say this
[03:36:46.080 --> 03:36:51.040]  the war we are fighting is real now the focus of this segment here is to connect some thoughts on
[03:36:51.040 --> 03:36:57.760]  what's happening in the larger sense and i look i don't think alex would you know necessarily uh
[03:36:57.760 --> 03:37:01.840]  before coming about this or talk to you about this but you've got no idea what's going on
[03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:07.920]  behind the scenes and and alex doesn't say much because that's the way he is he doesn't say much
[03:37:07.920 --> 03:37:13.520]  you've got no idea it attacks that are taking place behind the scenes and it's not just against
[03:37:13.520 --> 03:37:18.080]  alex jones and it's not against just against us it's against everybody within the alternative
[03:37:18.080 --> 03:37:25.120]  new media the honest media and the reason i bring this up is the never has never in the history of
[03:37:25.120 --> 03:37:30.080]  this country at least in modern times has there been a time when we've been this close to a civil
[03:37:30.080 --> 03:37:35.920]  war brewing or a revolution or a combination of a revolution and a civil war regardless it is
[03:37:35.920 --> 03:37:41.600]  really at our doorstep and the attacks now are coming in with ferocity and the attacks against
[03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:47.360]  alex jones are coming in with ferocity against us with absolute they're vicious and they're vile
[03:37:47.360 --> 03:37:52.640]  attacks but see here's the key to this we are fighting back and this is why i mentioned at
[03:37:52.640 --> 03:37:57.840]  the beginning of the segment but info war story is by the products support the operation because
[03:37:57.840 --> 03:38:03.680]  without that without your support none of this is going to happen and and i i wanted to start out
[03:38:03.680 --> 03:38:10.720]  the segment earlier just by saying that you the listener the viewer of info wars info wars dot
[03:38:10.720 --> 03:38:17.120]  com you are a participant in this war whether you know it or not whether you want to be in
[03:38:17.120 --> 03:38:23.360]  it or not and you know this but it's good to reiterate this just to remind ourselves where
[03:38:23.360 --> 03:38:28.720]  we're at there's no more sitting back and being a spectator what we're in right now is no longer
[03:38:28.720 --> 03:38:36.480]  has any spectators if you are silent then your silence will will tell which side you're on it is
[03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:41.680]  your silence that will define your future and i hope and pray that you will not be silent in the
[03:38:41.680 --> 03:38:48.000]  face of the the attacks that that we face because it will be you next time all of the legal attacks
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:53.120]  the censorship the conservatives the christian conservatives posting on twitter facebook
[03:38:53.120 --> 03:38:58.400]  they're being banned that's only just the sliver of the attacks what the left with the progressive
[03:38:58.400 --> 03:39:04.720]  fascist left what they want what they are doing today in the larger sense is they're opening up
[03:39:04.720 --> 03:39:11.040]  multiple battle fronts on one front you've got the censorship so you can't fight back and say i
[03:39:11.040 --> 03:39:17.600]  didn't say that for example well numerous examples with with alex jones and force people making fun of
[03:39:17.600 --> 03:39:23.120]  of or misquoting what alex jones says misquoting what i say i'd never you know we never said that
[03:39:23.120 --> 03:39:27.280]  but you can't fight back so they take away your ability to fight back now they're coming
[03:39:27.280 --> 03:39:31.040]  that's the first amendment now of course they open another front with respect to the second
[03:39:31.040 --> 03:39:38.000]  amendment and shame on the global shame on you punks that are using children as pawns and your sick
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:43.760]  perverse political game to rid this country of the second amendment shame on you you're nothing
[03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:48.320]  and i mean this you're nothing and these are my words you're nothing but punks when you take
[03:39:48.320 --> 03:39:54.960]  young people children and exploit them for your own perverse purposes that is to change the constitution
[03:39:54.960 --> 03:40:02.400]  to attack the second amendment this is what's taking place here but that's just one other front
[03:40:02.400 --> 03:40:06.080]  and then you've got another front as i said alex will never really talk about this because i know
[03:40:06.080 --> 03:40:10.240]  what goes on behind the scenes i've seen this steve quayle knows good what's going on behind
[03:40:10.240 --> 03:40:16.000]  the scenes he sees this we're part of this where you've got attack after attack they come after
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:22.080]  your sponsors they go after your platforms they go after your isps they go after everybody
[03:40:22.080 --> 03:40:29.120]  and this is again just a quote alex this is how to complain this is an observation so why did i
[03:40:29.120 --> 03:40:34.960]  bring all this up because war and war as you hear but one thing alex doesn't really tell you because
[03:40:34.960 --> 03:40:39.440]  it's we don't want to be the story it's we're not the story we don't want to be the story
[03:40:40.160 --> 03:40:46.560]  but the fact is this you can be the story you will be the story because it will happen to you
[03:40:47.600 --> 03:40:56.800]  if if it can happen to alex or mylo or uh uh uh tommy or whoever it can happen to you so
[03:40:58.320 --> 03:41:02.880]  you've got to have somebody to fight for you you've got to have somebody that's running point for you
[03:41:02.880 --> 03:41:10.160]  and the other part of this is we are at least in and these are my words again we can no longer
[03:41:10.160 --> 03:41:16.880]  play by their rules nor will we accept their rules especially when they have no rules or
[03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:23.520]  the rules that they have have turned into this um instead of of uh prison bars as opposed to rules
[03:41:23.520 --> 03:41:28.800]  no we're not going to be silenced we're not going to be gagged and we will we we will we're not
[03:41:28.800 --> 03:41:34.800]  running an offensive game not a defensive game but an offensive game and that by the way is what
[03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:40.000]  donald trump has been doing in my view and the information i've been getting as well i've got
[03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:46.160]  my sources alex has got his there's an offensive game going on but it's not the kind of game that
[03:41:46.160 --> 03:41:52.960]  you think it is it's a different kind of game it's it's he's broken the rules he stepped out of the
[03:41:52.960 --> 03:41:59.200]  normal presidential statesman arena because these are street fighters that we're fighting
[03:42:00.560 --> 03:42:03.440]  and if we don't fight like street fighters we're going to lose
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:09.600]  and i'm not saying breaking new laws that's not what i'm not advocating violence i'm just
[03:42:09.600 --> 03:42:16.160]  making an observation and saying as alex said earlier the worm has turned we've got them on the
[03:42:16.160 --> 03:42:22.240]  run and it's because of operations again like info wars and and to fund to keep it going go to
[03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:25.920]  info wars store.com i just i want to drive that home because i look i again i don't i don't get
[03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:30.960]  paid for this i get money for this but that's a reality because operations like this cost money

[03:47:58.320 --> 03:48:02.960]  i'm kidding you know we talk about a war taking place but let's drill down a little bit more we've
[03:48:02.960 --> 03:48:06.160]  got right now we're looking at and then this is on info wars right now you're looking at red alert
[03:48:06.160 --> 03:48:12.640]  russia crisis hotter than the cold war um you've got that breaking you've got the the geopolitical
[03:48:12.640 --> 03:48:17.840]  situation really teetering on edge now think about this if hillary quinton would be in office
[03:48:18.640 --> 03:48:23.280]  uh you know i don't know would we be cleaning up in our biohazard suits after an already
[03:48:23.280 --> 03:48:29.600]  third world war i don't know fourth world war i don't know but uh the fact is this the uh story
[03:48:29.600 --> 03:48:38.640]  of russian collusion the fact that uh of course you heard yesterday uh muhler his antics with respect
[03:48:38.640 --> 03:48:44.800]  to uh uh on the now on the domestic front uh his antics with respect to some even some people
[03:48:44.800 --> 03:48:48.480]  who come on info wars and and and detaining them and questioning them for russian ties
[03:48:49.120 --> 03:48:54.480]  what in the world is going on with this and if you're not paying attention to this you need to
[03:48:55.440 --> 03:49:00.640]  because i found some really disturbing evidence with respect to the muhler probe and and this is
[03:49:00.640 --> 03:49:06.320]  kind of my specialty i'm looking at this from the domestic and the geopolitics of course that all
[03:49:06.320 --> 03:49:12.880]  fits in but drilling down here on the domestic front the muhler investigation against donald
[03:49:12.880 --> 03:49:18.000]  trump think about this now i don't like to read and i'm not going to read i'm just going to paraphrase
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:24.160]  here uh uh yes we had a great interview last night with with diana west and she's author of a book
[03:49:24.160 --> 03:49:31.280]  called american betrayal and she talks about how this country america has been infiltrated by the
[03:49:31.280 --> 03:49:37.840]  by by the soviet russian communist basically since since world war two and how the power of how the
[03:49:38.560 --> 03:49:44.960]  various departments including and especially the department of state has um been infiltrated
[03:49:44.960 --> 03:49:49.680]  now consider what we're seeing today you've got accusations against president donald trump of
[03:49:49.680 --> 03:49:54.800]  russian collusion and of course the special counsel evolved from those accusations ostensibly
[03:49:54.800 --> 03:50:00.400]  and i use the word ostensibly because it's really not what happened that's just the the uh uh legalization
[03:50:00.400 --> 03:50:05.920]  of a spying entrapment ring against donald trump a coup attempt against donald trump that's still
[03:50:05.920 --> 03:50:11.600]  going on today roger stone talks about this uh germ course he talks about this alexa talks about
[03:50:11.600 --> 03:50:16.000]  this and i talk about this but i'm going to give you some information i don't think you've had anywhere
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:22.800]  else uh except for diana west there she is on the screen gray gray woman listen by the way american
[03:50:22.800 --> 03:50:27.040]  betrayal fantastic book it gives you some great foundational information for what is happening
[03:50:27.040 --> 03:50:34.320]  today but but just citing from that evidence and in her work evidence already indicates
[03:50:34.320 --> 03:50:40.560]  that a subversive effort was mounted from inside the u.s government and from external forces outside
[03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:48.960]  by the deep state under barack obama and and from the campaign that included the hillary clinton
[03:50:48.960 --> 03:50:57.280]  campaign and the minions such as uh john brennan the muslim cia director yes i said muslim cia
[03:50:57.280 --> 03:51:02.320]  director when you when you start putting again look at the rope a lot of strands a lot of information
[03:51:02.320 --> 03:51:07.920]  a lot of circumstantial evidence and that rope is pretty thick on brennan and you get komi and
[03:51:07.920 --> 03:51:14.560]  others they are the pawns of the deep state globalist the question becomes is all of
[03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:20.080]  what we're seeing today is it really all about merely politics in other words just to get hillary
[03:51:20.080 --> 03:51:26.880]  clinton into the white house is that what this is all about or is there something more i would
[03:51:26.880 --> 03:51:32.480]  submit there's something more and let me allow me to bring to you the jury a piece of evidence
[03:51:33.040 --> 03:51:39.840]  that again was cited by diana west or cultivated by diana west that i think speaks volumes about
[03:51:39.840 --> 03:51:47.760]  what we're seeing today when you look at the people involved in the miller witch hunt and you look at
[03:51:47.760 --> 03:51:56.000]  the infrastructure that was created during the campaign or during the uh coup the infrastructure
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:52:02.000]  of the coup against donald trump you see some things that will or should surprise you one of
[03:52:02.000 --> 03:52:08.640]  them being the wife of number four at department of justice at main justice and you know who i'm
[03:52:08.640 --> 03:52:15.840]  speaking about nelly or this mystery woman of intrigue nelly or let's take a closer look at
[03:52:15.840 --> 03:52:22.320]  nelly or for the remainder of this segment because this is key nelly or it was determined
[03:52:22.320 --> 03:52:27.360]  us you you might remember that again as wife of bruce war number four at department of justice
[03:52:27.360 --> 03:52:35.600]  she's the the woman that just attempted uh to well she got a ham radio license all right and that is
[03:52:35.600 --> 03:52:42.800]  a well-known counter surveillance technique if you want to get out of the normal if you don't
[03:52:42.800 --> 03:52:48.080]  want your discussions to be caught up by the NSA get yourself a ham radio license that'll do it
[03:52:48.080 --> 03:52:53.920]  that's the ticket well that's exactly what she did but it's interesting that when you look at the
[03:52:53.920 --> 03:52:58.560]  coup plotters and there's by the way conservative treehouse fantastic if you look on the screen
[03:52:58.560 --> 03:53:05.440]  uh a lot of work done by uh sundance extremely intricate work and when you start connecting
[03:53:05.440 --> 03:53:11.440]  the dots you start connecting the uh putting the other puzzle pieces on these coup plotters
[03:53:11.440 --> 03:53:18.080]  you'll find out that fusion gps fonder glenn simpson himself a journalist previous his wife
[03:53:18.080 --> 03:53:26.480]  mary jacobby and bruce and nelly or you'll find some common factors that predate a coup as a matter
[03:53:26.480 --> 03:53:35.120]  of fact they all served on a group it's it was a uh a think tank back in 2010 uh they all served on
[03:53:35.120 --> 03:53:43.360]  a think tank it was an expert working group on uh uh some uh well i'll just say it has some communist
[03:53:43.360 --> 03:53:48.560]  ties or at least not the not the think tank group but the but the topics had some communist
[03:53:48.560 --> 03:53:54.880]  implications there but it's interesting in this striking double omission when you look at the fusion
[03:53:54.880 --> 03:54:02.160]  gps uh co-founder glenn simpson in both his senate and house interviews one thing he failed to mention
[03:54:02.160 --> 03:54:07.120]  was the name of one of his key russian-speaking hires who was working on the anti-term project
[03:54:07.120 --> 03:54:14.160]  for the dnc and clinton campaign that's nelly or again the wife of bruce or why do i why am i focusing
[03:54:14.160 --> 03:54:18.720]  in on her because no one's talking about her at least not to the extent that they should
[03:54:18.720 --> 03:54:25.360]  but nelly or as stated by dana west is the woman in the middle uh not least because her husband
[03:54:25.360 --> 03:54:31.200]  is a former senior doj official bruce or who is the motor right before the flocks news disclosure
[03:54:31.200 --> 03:54:35.760]  right before the flocks news disclosedly his uh secret meetings with both his wife's boss simpson
[03:54:35.760 --> 03:54:42.800]  as and one of fusion's other russian experts christopher steele i would contend that everything
[03:54:42.800 --> 03:54:50.000]  i've seen the 35 page dossier who really wrote that it's attributed to christopher steele based
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:58.720]  on my sources this is key information here and uh also uh basically verified by jack casual who
[03:54:58.720 --> 03:55:04.560]  we have had endless discussions discussions with and he's been in my studio jack casual award-winning
[03:55:04.560 --> 03:55:11.920]  author i would contend that this this russian dossier 35 page dossier was authored by someone
[03:55:11.920 --> 03:55:21.520]  other than well not whose first language was on the english language enter nelly or i would also
[03:55:21.520 --> 03:55:27.040]  assert given all of the information that nelly or was part of the authorship of that 35 page dossier
[03:55:27.680 --> 03:55:36.720]  in addition you have nelly or being a pro-stollen apologist when you look at her senior thesis
[03:55:36.720 --> 03:55:42.160]  thesis when you look at her writings and they're they're very very hard to find but you'll find out
[03:55:42.160 --> 03:55:50.640]  that she is or based on her writings that she's a pro-stollen apologist this is the wife of the
[03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:56.080]  number former number four guy at the department of justice main think about these implications
[03:55:56.800 --> 03:56:00.800]  and go back to my original statement was this all about getting hillary clinton elected
[03:56:00.800 --> 03:56:08.400]  now i think a large part of it was but the ideology behind this the war that we are fighting is
[03:56:08.400 --> 03:56:15.520]  rooted in this soviet slash communist agenda i would urge everyone given the time here i'm
[03:56:15.520 --> 03:56:22.320]  running out of time i would urge everyone to research the the writings and the positions
[03:56:22.320 --> 03:56:27.920]  of nelly or and connect the dots between nelly or and glenn simpson and christopher steele
[03:56:27.920 --> 03:56:35.680]  and miller and look at the intricacies between miller and the war that he has waged the coup
[03:56:35.680 --> 03:56:39.840]  that he is currently waging against donald trump and everything will be revealed and
[03:56:39.840 --> 03:56:44.960]  he will come out with not just a rope but a well a huge rope that could that could be used by a tug
[03:56:44.960 --> 03:56:52.160]  boat at the end of the day the fight that we are fighting and the ponds that are that have
[03:56:52.160 --> 03:56:58.240]  constructed the surveillance apparatus and have used it as a weaponized operation of the coup
[03:56:58.240 --> 03:57:03.280]  against this nation against donald trump and have opened up the fronts that include that are not
[03:57:03.280 --> 03:57:08.720]  limited to the anti-second amendment protests the marches the hogwash that we see out there
[03:57:08.720 --> 03:57:13.600]  all of it and the attacks against the first amendment the censorship all of this is combined
[03:57:14.880 --> 03:57:19.440]  miller is just one segment one part of the battle and it's against donald trump but more
[03:57:19.440 --> 03:57:24.480]  importantly it's against each and every one of you which is why i say support info wars go to
