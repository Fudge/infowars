[00:00.000 --> 00:07.240]  Well, this Thursday brought more news from the Obama-run Justice Department.
[00:07.240 --> 00:14.440]  Dennis Hastert, the former Speaker of the House, the longest-serving Republican Speaker
[00:14.440 --> 00:19.520]  in history, was indicted by the FBI today.
[00:19.520 --> 00:21.400]  Now let's get one thing straight.
[00:21.400 --> 00:24.760]  I hate Denny Hastert.
[00:24.760 --> 00:30.880]  The globalist NSA tyranny-supporting frontman.
[00:30.880 --> 00:36.800]  And I remember interviewing investigative journalist Wayne Madsen who's on the show tomorrow,
[00:36.800 --> 00:42.520]  the Friday radio show, many times where he said that Dennis Hastert reportedly was being
[00:42.520 --> 00:49.400]  blackmailed for sexual improprieties with some of the senior members of the high school
[00:49.400 --> 00:53.400]  wrestling team that he brought to the championship level.
[00:53.400 --> 00:58.380]  And if one reads the indictment, it looks like that that's exactly what was going on.
[00:58.380 --> 01:04.360]  He paid a million and a half dollars, reportedly, allegedly, of three plus million he promised
[01:04.360 --> 01:09.120]  to someone to cover up a impropriety that he had committed.
[01:09.120 --> 01:11.360]  Now let's be clear.
[01:11.360 --> 01:12.640]  I don't like Dennis Hastert.
[01:12.640 --> 01:15.000]  I don't like the Republican leadership.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.640]  It was the Republican leadership that just went along with the TPP selling out our sovereignty
[01:19.640 --> 01:23.760]  in the Senate, but they don't have the votes in the House.
[01:23.760 --> 01:29.720]  And guess who Mr. Hastert is closely associated with and who was his underling?
[01:29.720 --> 01:33.640]  Speaker of the House, John Boehner.
[01:33.640 --> 01:39.480]  This is a major shot across the bow of the Republican leadership to get in line and do
[01:39.480 --> 01:43.000]  whatever Obama says or they'll be indicted.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.080]  These guys weren't led into positions of power unless they were compromised.
[01:47.080 --> 01:52.760]  That's why Mr. Hastert was taken from nowhere and basically put in the speakership only
[01:52.760 --> 01:59.640]  after a few years in the House of Representatives, unheard of because he was incredibly compromised.
[01:59.640 --> 02:03.000]  There's a whole other issue here, not just blackmail.
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.280]  Undoubtedly, this White House is the most corrupt I've ever seen.
[02:07.280 --> 02:11.560]  He makes Nixon look like an angel and Nixon was a tyrant.
[02:11.560 --> 02:17.560]  They've been going after Rick Perry for state vetoes that are totally legal.
[02:17.560 --> 02:19.160]  I don't like Rick Perry.
[02:19.160 --> 02:20.160]  It's just a fact.
[02:20.160 --> 02:22.800]  They've put Dinesh D'Souza, the filmmaker, in prison.
[02:22.800 --> 02:24.240]  He's still there now.
[02:24.240 --> 02:26.600]  They're going after all these Republican governors.
[02:26.600 --> 02:28.560]  They're inditing people left and right.
[02:28.560 --> 02:31.760]  When they ran Fast and Furious, they ran Benghazi.
[02:31.760 --> 02:36.880]  Hillary gets tens of millions of dollars a year for the Clinton Foundation from foreign
[02:36.880 --> 02:42.760]  dictators so that the State Department would sign off on illegal arms shipments.
[02:42.760 --> 02:49.480]  This is like Satan inditing one of his lower demons, Slimer.
[02:49.480 --> 02:56.520]  This is like the top mob boss, John Gotti, sitting as the judge over one of his street
[02:56.520 --> 02:59.680]  thugs that was caught shaking out an old lady.
[02:59.680 --> 03:00.680]  It's the hypocrisy.
[03:00.680 --> 03:04.640]  I mean, here's a parallel, an allegory, an example.
[03:04.640 --> 03:07.880]  I am for the death penalty biologically.
[03:07.880 --> 03:11.600]  I believe in a tribal level of the tribe caught some guy killing a kid or killing a woman
[03:11.600 --> 03:12.600]  or something.
[03:12.600 --> 03:13.600]  There was 10 witnesses.
[03:13.600 --> 03:14.600]  You stoned him to death.
[03:14.600 --> 03:15.600]  You throw him off a cliff.
[03:15.600 --> 03:16.600]  You burn him.
[03:16.600 --> 03:17.600]  You strangle him.
[03:17.600 --> 03:18.600]  You kill him.
[03:18.600 --> 03:23.680]  But you can't trust a corrupt government that's been proven to be framing people as
[03:23.680 --> 03:26.240]  the DNA showing to carry out the death penalty.
[03:26.240 --> 03:30.680]  So I'm against the death penalty because you can't trust the system to implement it.
[03:30.680 --> 03:31.880]  It's the same thing here.
[03:31.880 --> 03:35.960]  We have a one-sided reign of terror by the Democratic Party that is attempting a total
[03:35.960 --> 03:38.800]  takeover of society right now.
[03:38.800 --> 03:44.880]  And the Republicans, when they're in power, leave the Democrats alone.
[03:44.880 --> 03:45.880]  It's sick.
[03:45.880 --> 03:52.040]  I mean, the Democrats, even when the Republicans do everything they want and are totally intimidated,
[03:52.040 --> 03:54.040]  the Democrats continue this reign of terror.
[03:54.040 --> 03:57.880]  I mean, I think about all the people this Justice Department is inditing.
[03:57.880 --> 04:01.960]  And they got rid of Holder because of his corruption with the IRS probe and fasted furious
[04:01.960 --> 04:05.400]  and put this new minion in as the Attorney General.
[04:05.400 --> 04:10.040]  And so the reign of terror in Obama's last year and a half is starting.
[04:10.040 --> 04:13.400]  And if we don't get even a two-party system going on in this country, we're in trouble.
[04:13.400 --> 04:17.800]  We need two parties to keep each other in check, not the Democrats running roughshot
[04:17.800 --> 04:21.200]  like the Nazi Party or something taking over.
[04:21.200 --> 04:29.600]  One part of me loves to see the disgusting colon on two legs that is hastered in trouble.
[04:29.600 --> 04:35.800]  But my intellectual side goes, no, this is part of an unfair persecution of somebody
[04:35.800 --> 04:38.800]  who compared to the rest of them, quite frankly, is nothing.
[04:38.800 --> 04:40.320]  I mean, look at Penn State.
[04:40.320 --> 04:41.920]  That's a giant pedophile ring.
[04:41.920 --> 04:42.920]  The whole thing.
[04:42.920 --> 04:43.920]  All right, Barks.
[04:43.920 --> 04:44.920]  And they turned one guy.
[04:44.920 --> 04:49.000]  That's part of a report I shot downtown last night, went over to a friend's house and put
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.000]  that report up.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.920]  We're live on this Friday, 29th edition.
[04:52.920 --> 04:53.920]  Stay with us.
[04:53.920 --> 04:54.920]  It's a huge transmission.
[04:54.920 --> 05:00.520]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[05:00.520 --> 05:05.760]  Police departments and law enforcement agencies around the world have been using radar devices
[05:05.760 --> 05:07.720]  for a very long time.
[05:07.720 --> 05:13.880]  But now, new technology is being used that allows police officers to see and detect movement
[05:13.880 --> 05:15.360]  through solid walls.
[05:15.360 --> 05:21.080]  It requires no warrant for the cops to spy on you right there in the privacy of your
[05:21.080 --> 05:22.080]  own home.
[05:22.080 --> 05:28.360]  USA Today is reporting that at least 50 U.S. law enforcement agencies have secretly equipped
[05:28.360 --> 05:33.680]  their officers with radar devices that allow them to effectively peer through the walls
[05:33.680 --> 05:34.680]  of houses.
[05:34.680 --> 05:40.600]  And it has been confirmed with the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Services that both agencies
[05:40.600 --> 05:46.440]  are using this technology without obtaining warrants, but of course, and now there is
[05:46.440 --> 05:52.760]  even more advanced technology being introduced with 3D capabilities that are capable of being
[05:52.760 --> 05:54.840]  mounted on drones.

[07:20.240 --> 07:22.240]  of using synthetic chemicals.

[07:37.640 --> 07:42.840]  maximum potency, they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover
[07:42.840 --> 07:46.640]  that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets
[07:46.640 --> 07:51.000]  your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I

[08:11.560 --> 08:19.800]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:19.800 --> 08:27.080]  It is headspinning the news that is here in front of me today.
[08:27.080 --> 08:32.200]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday worldwide broadcast, the 29th day of
[08:32.200 --> 08:34.200]  May, 2015.
[08:34.200 --> 08:36.960]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[08:36.960 --> 08:41.480]  Headspinning to say the least.
[08:41.480 --> 08:46.800]  First off today, we're going to cover the indictment that broke after the broadcast in the afternoon
[08:46.800 --> 08:54.240]  yesterday of the longest serving Republican Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert.
[08:54.240 --> 09:03.440]  Dennis Hastert was a horrible neocon rhino, an open borders promoting, high tax promoting,
[09:03.440 --> 09:09.960]  Patriot Act police state promoting blob.
[09:09.960 --> 09:14.320]  And I remember many times having Wayne Madsen on the broadcast, formerly with the National
[09:14.320 --> 09:29.320]  Security Agency, I remember having him on many, many times and him saying that Dennis
[09:29.320 --> 09:37.560]  Hastert was compromised, Dennis Hastert was blackmailed, and that Dennis Hastert basically
[09:37.560 --> 09:42.320]  molested wrestlers when he was a high school wrestling coach.
[09:42.320 --> 09:45.880]  Now a lot of guests get up on air and say things like that, I'll kick them off the show
[09:45.880 --> 09:52.440]  or I'll delay them, I'll sit there and basically erase on live radio what they're saying.
[09:52.440 --> 09:59.300]  I don't do that very often, but if something isn't already substantiated, or if I haven't
[09:59.300 --> 10:02.880]  documented it myself, I don't put that out.
[10:02.880 --> 10:08.560]  But Madsen is an investigative journalist, he went and spent, I don't know, since Obama's
[10:08.560 --> 10:14.840]  been in office and before, probably overall six, eight months that I know of inside Chicago
[10:14.840 --> 10:22.760]  sniffing around, substantiating that Obama goes to bathhouses and has homosexual sex,
[10:22.760 --> 10:27.720]  substantiating that the mayor there does that as well from his sources, substantiating
[10:27.720 --> 10:33.040]  that Hastert's involved in all sorts of activities, reportedly, and this is why they put them
[10:33.040 --> 10:39.600]  all basically in power and it's why they burned the governor who was just in with the whole
[10:39.600 --> 10:47.680]  group in basic mafia activity was to send a message to Obama and everybody else, you'll
[10:47.680 --> 10:55.000]  do exactly what you're told when you're told.
[10:55.000 --> 11:03.000]  So I'm not sad that Mr. Hastert has been indicted and I've read the indictment and he did what
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.360]  all these idiots do, he lied to the government, basically under oath, there's a federal
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.040]  law when you're talking to the FBI, it's basically under oath, I don't think it's constitutional,
[11:13.040 --> 11:16.680]  but regardless, he said the money he was taking out was for him.
[11:16.680 --> 11:20.920]  How about talk to the hand?
[11:20.920 --> 11:26.480]  How about you guys want to cook something up?
[11:26.480 --> 11:32.320]  Go do it on your own, I'm not talking to you.
[11:32.320 --> 11:43.600]  But Hastert reportedly allegedly lied to the FBI about what was going on and the $3 million
[11:43.600 --> 11:49.440]  he was going to pay this individual, he paid him a million and a half dollars reportedly
[11:49.440 --> 11:52.880]  in $10,000 or under $10,000 increments trying to hide it.
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.320]  As if the government doesn't notice someone trying to take out under $10,000, Christmas
[11:58.320 --> 12:02.040]  has come up before and I'm handing out bonuses at the office and then the friends and family
[12:02.040 --> 12:05.960]  and I'll say with 50 something employees and family and everything, I'll say, go get
[12:05.960 --> 12:16.760]  $12,000 out of the company bank, now that people say to me, well, go under that, it's
[12:16.760 --> 12:21.280]  after tax money, we're not hiding it.
[12:21.280 --> 12:26.160]  But see, this is the whole mindset of what it's like to live under tyranny, where people
[12:26.160 --> 12:27.960]  think normal activity is illegal.
[12:27.960 --> 12:33.120]  So this whole thing is bigger than Dennis Hastert.
[12:33.120 --> 12:37.240]  And if you want to know why this is happening now, hands down, I don't know what Wayne Madsen
[12:37.240 --> 12:40.800]  is going to say when he comes on, but he really knows his stuff, formerly the National Security
[12:40.800 --> 12:46.920]  Agency, you're watching C-SPAN and watching National Security, hearing, you'll almost
[12:46.920 --> 12:51.720]  always see him in the audience, you'll see him in the audience, the National Press Club,
[12:51.720 --> 12:53.800]  he really knows his stuff.
[12:53.800 --> 12:59.040]  I've interviewed three or four people that he put me in contact with that end up dead,
[12:59.040 --> 13:00.680]  like the DC Madame.
[13:00.680 --> 13:07.320]  I mean, the stuff he's onto is not child's play, it's real.
[13:07.320 --> 13:11.240]  This is big boy pants stuff here on this radio show.
[13:11.240 --> 13:15.960]  We go where nobody else dares to go, because it's our duty to do it.
[13:15.960 --> 13:22.720]  We're not showing off and I've said it's not fun.
[13:22.720 --> 13:26.200]  So he's joining us at the bottom of the hour and there's just a cornucopia of other important
[13:26.200 --> 13:31.720]  news, obviously, but we have the indictment right here, give you a document cam shot of
[13:31.720 --> 13:34.080]  that or put it on screen.
[13:34.080 --> 13:41.840]  The Washington Post asked the big question, they say, what is the impropriety that he
[13:41.840 --> 13:49.160]  supposedly admitted to that he'd wronged someone, that he was going to pay them $3 million?
[13:49.160 --> 14:00.200]  Well, it has to do, the indictment says with his time, from 81 to 2007 and it gets into
[14:00.200 --> 14:09.440]  his time as a wrestling coach.
[14:09.440 --> 14:16.000]  Now I'm not saying he's guilty of all this, but you don't get to that level of power now
[14:16.000 --> 14:22.760]  of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Dennis Astard and John Boehner and Mitch McConnell,
[14:22.760 --> 14:28.800]  unless they've got skeletons in the closet that can destroy them at any time.
[14:28.800 --> 14:33.600]  In the film adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, that's not very good compared to the
[14:33.600 --> 14:40.320]  book, Baron Harkinen adds heart plugs to people where he can just pull a plug out like the
[14:40.320 --> 14:46.800]  top of a carton of milk and it opens up the side of your heart and all your blood sprays
[14:46.800 --> 14:53.480]  out against the wall.
[14:53.480 --> 15:00.080]  And that's basically what all these politicians have is political heart plugs so that any
[15:00.080 --> 15:08.280]  time they want, they can just sick the Federal Bureau of Investigation in there that knows
[15:08.280 --> 15:13.080]  full well the big banks launder almost all the drug money, run the aircraft, run the
[15:13.080 --> 15:16.200]  child sex slave rings, the snuff films, all of it.
[15:16.200 --> 15:21.320]  It even comes out in the news that, you know, dying corps is involved in giant child kidnapping
[15:21.320 --> 15:26.360]  things, nobody gets in trouble for kids in dungeons.
[15:26.360 --> 15:33.360]  They only burned Dennis Astard to send a message right now to Boehner and to McConnell and
[15:33.360 --> 15:35.560]  to the Democrats, not just Republicans.
[15:35.560 --> 15:42.800]  You get in line, we don't care if polls are 87 to 90 percent against TPP global treaty.
[15:42.800 --> 15:45.920]  We don't care how tyrannical it is, we don't care.
[15:45.920 --> 15:49.440]  You do what you're told and then even when you're voted out of office, we're going to
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.520]  go ahead and indict you anyways.
[15:53.520 --> 15:56.560]  They're running scared.
[15:56.560 --> 16:04.080]  We have a captured blackmailed, intimidated government.
[16:04.080 --> 16:09.720]  And folks, we got people like Colonel Schaefer who ran the anti-Ben Laden operation that
[16:09.720 --> 16:13.520]  could have killed him twice and the White House ordered him to stand down.
[16:13.520 --> 16:18.640]  He simply complained to the Defense Committee in the House, the Armed Services Committee,
[16:18.640 --> 16:26.080]  and they began the move to indict him with the FBI for 60-something dollars in phone
[16:26.080 --> 16:32.600]  bills saying he couldn't call his wife as a colonel, saying he'd be late to dinner when
[16:32.600 --> 16:41.960]  he got back to the U.S. and that it was stealing to use his phone to what was the investigation.
[16:41.960 --> 16:46.400]  Said he was, he called, I think it was a Jiffy Lube or something, he called a Lube place
[16:46.400 --> 16:52.440]  to have his car set up an appointment, he called his wife, of course anybody knows
[16:52.440 --> 16:57.400]  that an officer in the U.S. military can call their wife on their phone.
[16:57.400 --> 16:59.800]  This is though, this is what they'll come after you for.
[16:59.800 --> 17:05.560]  They will indict a ham sandwich, as it was once famously said, I forget by who.
[17:05.560 --> 17:11.760]  You guys Google who said you can indict a ham sandwich and I think it was Jim Garrison.
[17:11.760 --> 17:19.040]  But this is what we're dealing with here, is crazy town.
[17:19.040 --> 17:24.560]  And by the way, if you don't have any corruption in your background, they'll make it up or
[17:24.560 --> 17:29.800]  they'll call up your wife and harass her and threaten to attack your family until your
[17:29.800 --> 17:32.840]  wife cracks up.
[17:32.840 --> 17:47.280]  I was New York State Chief Judge, Saul Wachler was famously quoted by Tom Wolf in the bonfire
[17:47.280 --> 17:54.560]  of the vanities that a grand jury would indict a ham sandwich if that's what you wanted.
[17:54.560 --> 17:59.160]  I guess it was repeated by Jim Garrison.
[17:59.160 --> 18:02.560]  So when I put out that alert video last night, a minority of people were saying why are you
[18:02.560 --> 18:05.440]  defending Dennis Astrid, why are you being partisan?
[18:05.440 --> 18:09.400]  I'm not being partisan, I'm telling it like it is, I've been watching politics closely
[18:09.400 --> 18:19.520]  for 25 years, I've been on air for 20 immersed in it.
[18:19.520 --> 18:26.680]  And they are targeting Republicans, this Democratic Party and journalists and their
[18:26.680 --> 18:33.520]  own people and free speech and whistleblowers at an exponential level about three times
[18:33.520 --> 18:36.000]  what it's ever been before.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.320]  And that's basically a quote by Jonathan Turley, constitutional lawyer and a big liberal, that
[18:40.320 --> 18:46.840]  Obama is engaged in basically triple the persecution of free speech and freedom.
[18:46.840 --> 18:51.040]  And it's because he's completely blackmailed himself, I mean my gosh, his father is a famous
[18:51.040 --> 18:57.640]  communist publisher and pornographer, Frank Marshall Davis.
[18:57.640 --> 19:03.680]  They had to tweet the president questions yesterday as if he was really responding himself.
[19:03.680 --> 19:07.520]  And so he asked him, does he ever visit Frank Marshall Davis' grave, you might want to retweet
[19:07.520 --> 19:14.880]  that, that's up on real Alex Jones, but filmmakers like Dinesh just sues Rick Perry's, last time
[19:14.880 --> 19:25.640]  I heard, they're still trying to put him in jail for vetoing, funding for a county initiative
[19:25.640 --> 19:31.640]  to fight official corruption and then the person running it is spitting on police and
[19:31.640 --> 19:34.320]  attacking people and acting like a total maniac.
[19:34.320 --> 19:39.320]  So they indict Rick Perry, I mean that's a local issue, but the Democrats are just running
[19:39.320 --> 19:48.120]  wild when they themselves, Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the Clinton donors, foreign dictators
[19:48.120 --> 19:53.160]  give her money so this State Department head, the Secretary of State, she would sell them
[19:53.160 --> 20:00.800]  the weapons, authorize the weapons sales, I mean it's crazy.

[24:13.360 --> 24:18.440]  This weekend in Phoenix, they're having a Draw the Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest
[24:18.440 --> 24:19.440]  in Phoenix.
[24:19.440 --> 24:25.080]  Joe Biggs had the idea to fly out there as soon as it became apparent that ISIS was claiming
[24:25.080 --> 24:27.320]  they're going to hit it.
[24:27.320 --> 24:31.960]  This morning I called and said, hey, send Joe Biggs if he wants to go and Joe Biggs
[24:31.960 --> 24:36.480]  was already going to an airport, had already been authorized by Rob Do, our news director
[24:36.480 --> 24:37.480]  to go.
[24:37.480 --> 24:40.600]  So I love the initiative of Joe Biggs.
[24:40.600 --> 24:42.640]  He'll be there covering that.
[24:42.640 --> 24:50.440]  He's expected outside Phoenix Mosque at Muhammad cartoon contest and there's a former marines
[24:50.440 --> 24:55.120]  and others are in the CNN article saying he has no middle ground when it comes to Islam.
[24:55.120 --> 25:01.600]  His T-shirt pretty much says it all, F-Islam, Ritz Hammer is the organizer of Friday's Freedom
[25:01.600 --> 25:05.640]  of Speech rally outside the Islamic Community Center in Phoenix.
[25:05.640 --> 25:10.640]  It's the mosque that Elton Simpson and Nader Sufi attended for a time.
[25:10.640 --> 25:17.440]  They were the men who drove from Arizona to Dallas suburb to shoot up the Prophet Muhammad
[25:17.440 --> 25:19.560]  cartoon contest there.
[25:19.560 --> 25:21.720]  Both were killed by police.
[25:21.720 --> 25:26.280]  Many Muslims consider demeaning depictions of Muhammad to be blasphemous and banned by
[25:26.280 --> 25:28.280]  Islamic law.
[25:28.280 --> 25:29.280]  Here's the deal.
[25:29.280 --> 25:30.800]  I'm not Islamophobic as they call it.
[25:30.800 --> 25:35.400]  I know there are a lot of good Muslims that are good people, a lot of smart scientists,
[25:35.400 --> 25:37.960]  you know, nice folks.
[25:37.960 --> 25:42.480]  The problem is radical Islam is being funded by Saudi Arabia and the West.
[25:42.480 --> 25:43.760]  It's being allowed to take over.
[25:43.760 --> 25:49.680]  It's combined forces with the left and it is just breeding.
[25:49.680 --> 25:53.840]  And whereas I don't want to be confrontational at the same time, the First Amendment needs
[25:53.840 --> 25:58.240]  to be upheld and they just want to have this multicultural takeover and everybody just
[25:58.240 --> 26:03.040]  lays down to it and people aren't going to lay down anymore.
[26:03.040 --> 26:05.480]  People are done.
[26:05.480 --> 26:08.640]  And so things are going to be escalating.
[26:08.640 --> 26:12.680]  That certainly is clear.
[26:12.680 --> 26:15.600]  Now I want to shift gears out of that back in the Dennis Hassard situation.
[26:15.600 --> 26:21.760]  Then we're going to get into, Julian Assange says TPP, we have the clip coming up of this.
[26:21.760 --> 26:25.840]  Only five of 29 sanctions are about traditional trade.
[26:25.840 --> 26:31.880]  Well, we're glad, Mr. Assange, that you want to be the important guy so you won't release
[26:31.880 --> 26:34.000]  the entire 30 plus parts.
[26:34.000 --> 26:39.600]  You'll only release the part on the internet that's the most draconian internet killing,
[26:39.600 --> 26:44.280]  taxing, regulating, three strikes, you're banned from the web, corporate boards decide,
[26:44.280 --> 26:46.120]  no due process.
[26:46.120 --> 26:48.240]  What are you doing?
[26:48.240 --> 26:53.920]  Not releasing all the sections because they now say there's only 29, there were 33 sections
[26:53.920 --> 26:56.720]  back when they first said WikiLeaks had the info.
[26:56.720 --> 27:01.000]  And so that video is up on infowars.com and give them a play clip in the next segment.
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.000]  Now I don't want to sit here and just bash WikiLeaks, but they dole out what they want
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.760]  when they want.
[27:07.760 --> 27:11.120]  We know what they've done in the EU and we know what they've done in the NAU and this
[27:11.120 --> 27:12.840]  is just more of that.
[27:12.840 --> 27:20.280]  It is anti-gun, it is open border, it is globalism, it is free speech restrictions, it's everything.
[27:20.280 --> 27:23.280]  But why won't WikiLeaks release it?
[27:23.280 --> 27:26.480]  Congress won't release it.
[27:26.480 --> 27:29.560]  Amnesty's secret, secret trade deals are secret.
[27:29.560 --> 27:35.240]  The point is it's not a trade deal, it's a global government treaty.
[27:35.240 --> 27:39.440]  Assisted suicide bills advancing in California legislature, Fukushima produce making its
[27:39.440 --> 27:45.440]  way into international stores here in the US.
[27:45.440 --> 27:53.040]  Huge news on the economy, US economy contracted to 0.7, it was 0.2, but now we learn that this
[27:53.040 --> 27:55.520]  happened in the first quarter.
[27:55.520 --> 27:57.480]  That's all coming up.
[27:57.480 --> 28:01.320]  But just finishing up on my points on Dennis Hastert, the Speaker of the House being indicted
[28:01.320 --> 28:09.680]  yesterday by the FBI, you can just go to infowars.com and read the indictment for yourself.
[28:09.680 --> 28:23.800]  This is a grand jury a year ago, basically back in February 2014, and they're just now
[28:23.800 --> 28:27.760]  rolling these out, they waited until they got rid of the Attorney General who's totally
[28:27.760 --> 28:34.440]  discredited to put a new puppet to carry out the exact same operations, a political persecution.
[28:34.440 --> 28:40.080]  Dennis Hastert is a horrible poster child, poster goblin.
[28:40.080 --> 28:43.240]  For everything wrong with the Republican Party, I don't like him.
[28:43.240 --> 28:48.320]  He is just a Republican name only, he is a horrible creature.
[28:48.320 --> 28:57.880]  And Wayne Madsen has said many times he's connected reportedly to molesting young men
[28:57.880 --> 28:59.040]  there at the high school.
[28:59.040 --> 29:02.840]  And that's what this indictment seems to point towards, he was trying to cover up something
[29:02.840 --> 29:06.480]  at the high school and it paid the person a million and a half dollars.
[29:06.480 --> 29:11.680]  The issue is the FBI knows about the government drug dealing, the central banks owning the
[29:11.680 --> 29:15.400]  aircraft, it's all come out, they do nothing, they're allowed to do nothing.
[29:15.400 --> 29:19.560]  15 of the 19 hijackers, they were ordered to let them in, had to stand down.
[29:19.560 --> 29:20.560]  They wanted to bust them.
[29:20.560 --> 29:25.400]  The point is the FBI is allowed to go after who the system wants them to go after.
[29:25.400 --> 29:28.580]  They don't go after the billionaires, they don't go after the globalist, they're burning
[29:28.580 --> 29:35.400]  politicians occasionally to send a message, you do what you're told no matter how unpopular
[29:35.400 --> 29:42.360]  TPP is, no matter how unpopular all this garbage is, you go along with it or we're going to
[29:42.360 --> 29:44.480]  put you under the jail.
[29:44.480 --> 29:47.240]  And this is how our country is captured and controlled.
[29:47.240 --> 29:51.560]  The FBI is so discredited, they have no business in dining any barge or having a grand jury
[29:51.560 --> 29:53.560]  in dining any barge.
[29:53.560 --> 30:00.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network, I mean look at the crime lab.
[30:00.920 --> 30:06.640]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called
[30:06.640 --> 30:13.960]  Stingrays which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[30:13.960 --> 30:20.480]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI who have forced our nation's police departments
[30:20.480 --> 30:27.080]  into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[30:27.080 --> 30:32.200]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment and they have no legal
[30:32.200 --> 30:37.400]  authority for warrantless Stingray spying where we now know that police are collecting
[30:37.400 --> 30:43.840]  information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[30:43.840 --> 30:48.840]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[30:48.840 --> 31:17.840]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance, Infowars.com.

[33:16.600 --> 33:23.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[33:23.280 --> 33:33.280]  GCN Radio Network.
[33:33.280 --> 33:35.800]  Wayne Madsen is going to be joining us in a moment.
[33:35.800 --> 33:42.760]  A real expert on Denny Hastert, the now-indicted former Speaker of the House, the Republican.
[33:42.760 --> 33:47.960]  This is undoubtedly a political action by the Democratic Party that is involved in a
[33:47.960 --> 33:53.000]  political reign of terror going after journalist, whistleblowers, you name it, though I have
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.720]  no doubt that where there's smoke, there's fire, Hastert's probably guilty from the sources
[33:58.720 --> 33:59.720]  I have.
[33:59.720 --> 34:04.120]  It looks like they've got a pretty clear-cut case here, but I don't know Wayne Madsen's
[34:04.120 --> 34:05.120]  take on it yet.
[34:05.120 --> 34:06.120]  We're about to find out.
[34:06.120 --> 34:11.080]  Investigative journalist, former NSA officer, Wayne Madsen, but he has said for a long time
[34:11.080 --> 34:15.920]  Hastert was totally compromised and that it was reportedly dealing with ties back to when
[34:15.920 --> 34:17.840]  he was a wrestling coach.
[34:17.840 --> 34:20.160]  No one else I'd ever heard say that.
[34:20.160 --> 34:25.200]  Madsen has incredible sources, has spent upwards of half a year off and on in Illinois
[34:25.200 --> 34:30.040]  investigating the whole crime syndicate there, so we'll talk to him for the news behind the
[34:30.040 --> 34:33.840]  news, the story behind the story, the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say in
[34:33.840 --> 34:34.840]  a moment.
[34:34.840 --> 34:39.520]  But first, a new intro promo that our own Jakari Jackson put together.
[34:39.520 --> 34:43.360]  I thought we'd premiere that here right now.
[34:43.360 --> 34:49.720]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully
[34:49.720 --> 34:51.320]  activists.
[34:51.320 --> 34:57.800]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshipers, maybe you can
[34:57.800 --> 34:58.800]  call the A-team.
[34:58.800 --> 34:59.800]  How many did I assault?
[34:59.800 --> 35:00.800]  I killed my kids.
[35:00.800 --> 35:01.800]  I killed my kids.
[35:01.800 --> 35:12.800]  So one f***ing friend was raised a f***ing male that doesn't stand for women's rights.
[35:12.800 --> 35:16.560]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[35:16.560 --> 35:18.960]  That's pretty cool, man.
[35:18.960 --> 35:22.760]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[35:22.760 --> 35:25.400]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[35:25.400 --> 35:27.400]  I don't think so.
[35:27.400 --> 35:36.680]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[35:36.680 --> 35:37.680]  I pay for them.
[35:37.680 --> 35:38.680]  I thought you said three.
[35:38.680 --> 35:39.680]  Upwards of 50.
[35:39.680 --> 35:40.680]  Really?
[35:40.680 --> 35:41.680]  Oh, yeah.
[35:41.680 --> 35:42.680]  F*** you, you piece of f***ing s***.
[35:42.680 --> 35:43.680]  Bunch of misogynists and motherf***ers.
[35:43.680 --> 35:44.680]  Take your male privilege somewhere else.
[35:44.680 --> 35:45.680]  What's up, are you being aggressive?
[35:45.680 --> 35:46.680]  I'm being aggressive.
[35:46.680 --> 35:47.680]  F***ing us!
[35:47.680 --> 35:48.680]  Excuse us!
[35:48.680 --> 36:11.800]  These stats think guys that attack Alex Jones.
[36:11.800 --> 36:17.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[36:17.360 --> 36:28.440]  We should call that video Pro Abortionist Caught Chanting Satan Again or New Video Abortionist
[36:28.440 --> 36:29.440]  Worship Satan.
[36:29.440 --> 36:36.040]  We need to put that video up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[36:36.040 --> 36:38.760]  And look, I'm not here bashing women that have had abortions.
[36:38.760 --> 36:43.440]  The point is the people driving and pushing it are into the occult.
[36:43.440 --> 36:48.960]  I just learned this from investigating over the years and it's an anti-human, anti-minority
[36:48.960 --> 36:52.720]  movement to get rid of mainly poor black people in Hispanics.
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.840]  And so I'm just sick of the Democratic Party trying to race bait all day when more blacks
[36:57.840 --> 37:01.080]  have been aborted since Roe v. Wade than have been born.
[37:01.080 --> 37:03.240]  And there's new numbers out today.
[37:03.240 --> 37:07.440]  We've aborted more people since Roe v. Wade than lived in the country in 1880.
[37:07.440 --> 37:13.960]  CNS News reports on that, so Margaret Sanger, the Rockefellers, they taught Hitler everything
[37:13.960 --> 37:18.680]  he knew, just admit the roots of what's pushing it, okay?
[37:18.680 --> 37:20.440]  I'm not here judging you.
[37:20.440 --> 37:24.200]  I'm not here on some high horse saying blah, blah, blah, you're a killer.
[37:24.200 --> 37:27.280]  I've told people that I've been involved in abortions when I was younger.
[37:27.280 --> 37:32.480]  I think it's bad, it's wrong, I've repented of it, but I'm not here judging you.
[37:32.480 --> 37:37.800]  I'm simply saying it's treating humans like trash and the anti-abortion pro-life people
[37:37.800 --> 37:40.080]  were right back in the 70s.
[37:40.080 --> 37:45.160]  Then it's old people, then it's babies, then it's cripples, oh I was politically incorrect
[37:45.160 --> 37:54.920]  but it's okay to kill them, it's the disabled, it's the veterans on don't treat list.
[37:54.920 --> 37:58.400]  And they always confuse it with a right to die argument.
[37:58.400 --> 38:00.280]  Sure individuals I think have a right to die.
[38:00.280 --> 38:04.400]  The problem is you can't have the state involved in it because it will become euthanasia and
[38:04.400 --> 38:07.960]  it is euthanasia now where the state decides to kill you.
[38:07.960 --> 38:10.840]  See it's where the agenda comes from.
[38:10.840 --> 38:20.240]  We're going to Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com, bestselling author, probably one of the most
[38:20.240 --> 38:22.920]  dialed in connected people ever.
[38:22.920 --> 38:25.680]  In fact I'm surprised he's alive.
[38:25.680 --> 38:30.400]  A lot of people that he has put on the show that he's given his contact to have ended
[38:30.400 --> 38:31.400]  up dead.
[38:31.400 --> 38:36.520]  I can think of three or four of them right now, DC Madame and others, I mean folks we've
[38:36.520 --> 38:42.840]  had the Navy SEAL families on about that being a stage raid and saying it was a body double.
[38:42.840 --> 38:47.240]  Do you think it was fun meeting with people before they went public and knowing all this
[38:47.240 --> 38:49.400]  and being the first person to talk about it?
[38:49.400 --> 38:56.280]  You'll see I love my peers, it feels so good to not be alone and to have people like Wayne
[38:56.280 --> 38:57.280]  Madsen.
[38:57.280 --> 39:01.960]  I'm not in competition, I wish there were 50,000 Wayne Madsen's, I wish there was talk
[39:01.960 --> 39:07.160]  show host better than I am, better authors, better orators, better researchers.
[39:07.160 --> 39:10.040]  I want to win, I want to defeat this.
[39:10.040 --> 39:13.960]  I can feel the hair on the back of my neck standing up folks.
[39:13.960 --> 39:18.480]  I got the feds following me around, contacting me, threatening me.
[39:18.480 --> 39:23.240]  I mean it's not fun, but then I've got other feds that are good giving us information.
[39:23.240 --> 39:28.800]  There's a fight between good and evil in government, in corporations, in churches, in businesses,
[39:28.800 --> 39:34.240]  in our neighborhoods and it's time for good people to stand up and say no.
[39:34.240 --> 39:38.240]  Briefly, we are funded by viewers and listeners like you.
[39:38.240 --> 39:43.600]  We bring you the very best nutraceuticals at the highest quality at m4warslife.com.
[39:43.600 --> 39:46.880]  We have the highest quality vitamin B12 that we could find.
[39:46.880 --> 39:49.960]  In fact, no one else sells this.
[39:49.960 --> 39:56.360]  No one we know of sells medical grade, organic, pure, totally clean.
[39:56.360 --> 40:00.560]  We have the test published on m4warslife.com, methylcobalamin.
[40:00.560 --> 40:04.680]  This is the stuff that you go to the doctor and get prescriptions for to inject.
[40:04.680 --> 40:08.480]  But you can get it without a prescription, just no one, other companies just want to
[40:08.480 --> 40:12.800]  sell you stuff that costs 40 cents in the bottle.
[40:12.800 --> 40:15.680]  This cost us $9 what goes in the bottle.
[40:15.680 --> 40:17.760]  Yeah, then we sell it for $24.95.
[40:17.760 --> 40:20.200]  We mark it up 150%.
[40:20.200 --> 40:25.120]  The average stuff out there has a 6% to 7% markup, the average stuff.
[40:25.120 --> 40:26.120]  We don't do that.
[40:26.120 --> 40:29.760]  We have to fund ourselves so that some things have a 50% markup, 100% markup, 150% markup
[40:29.760 --> 40:32.720]  because there's marketing, the crew, the whole place to pay for.
[40:32.720 --> 40:35.440]  It's very expensive.
[40:35.440 --> 40:37.520]  But our products are game changers.
[40:37.520 --> 40:45.160]  Well, it's 16% off right now at m4warslife.com and they're game changers because we just
[40:45.160 --> 40:49.760]  bring you the absolute nutraceutical best we can get after doing years of research per
[40:49.760 --> 40:52.040]  product in some cases.
[40:52.040 --> 40:54.360]  Sometimes it's three, four months of research to find the best.
[40:54.360 --> 40:58.680]  Sometimes it's, well, GRIP spent five years trying to get ahold of this and he finally
[40:58.680 --> 41:00.920]  did and gave it to us.
[41:00.920 --> 41:01.920]  Five years.
[41:01.920 --> 41:02.920]  And we looked into it.
[41:02.920 --> 41:03.920]  We didn't just believe him.
[41:03.920 --> 41:05.720]  And we have the industry calling us.
[41:05.720 --> 41:10.640]  We have billion-dollar, multi-billion-dollar companies contacting wanting to partner with
[41:10.640 --> 41:11.640]  us right now.
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.320]  I mean, real blessings are happening because we're doing the right thing.
[41:16.320 --> 41:18.200]  So praise God for that.
[41:18.200 --> 41:20.160]  And people say, man, quit praising God all the time.
[41:20.160 --> 41:21.160]  We're sick of it.
[41:21.160 --> 41:23.120]  Hey, call it a crutch, whatever you want.
[41:23.120 --> 41:24.600]  There are no atheists in foxholes.
[41:24.600 --> 41:30.040]  The deeper I get down this new-world order, the more I need to cling to God.
[41:30.040 --> 41:31.040]  Or I'd crap myself.
[41:31.040 --> 41:37.840]  I mean, it's so legendary and epic what we're all involved in, all of us, that I hope you
[41:37.840 --> 41:38.840]  realize that.
[41:38.840 --> 41:42.240]  So I bring it up a lot because we're going into the fiery furnace.
[41:42.240 --> 41:43.760]  We're going out into the arena.
[41:43.760 --> 41:44.760]  This is it.
[41:44.760 --> 41:48.640]  We're going into global corporate fascism worldwide right now.
[41:48.640 --> 41:51.240]  So strap yourselves in.
[41:51.240 --> 41:59.760]  I got to tell you, we have the best seaweed-derived type tested to be totally pure, which is
[41:59.760 --> 42:02.000]  really hard to do.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.440]  And we've got, again, the big lab test at infowarslife.com.
[42:04.440 --> 42:07.880]  You can go read the lab test on the pages there.
[42:07.880 --> 42:11.040]  And that was original X2.
[42:11.040 --> 42:12.680]  That was original survival shield.
[42:12.680 --> 42:13.680]  It was the best seller.
[42:13.680 --> 42:18.080]  Then, because we had folks out there trying to do espionage, and this is what happens
[42:18.080 --> 42:22.520]  in business, but a lot of it was governmental-type groups, through operatives, and I'm going
[42:22.520 --> 42:27.360]  to go to Wayne Madsen, trying to basically shut down our sources of pure iodine, which
[42:27.360 --> 42:28.800]  is DEA control.
[42:28.800 --> 42:30.000]  It's the good halogen.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.880]  It's just so incredible what happens when this gets into your glands, like your thyroid
[42:33.880 --> 42:39.880]  instead of the bad stuff, like all the boring, and chlorine, and fluoride, and the bad halogens.
[42:39.880 --> 42:45.280]  Then, for the last year and a half, we were able to get X2 that is a pure crystal, 99999,
[42:45.280 --> 42:46.280]  whatever.
[42:46.280 --> 42:48.520]  I mean, it's just, it's almost completely pure.
[42:48.520 --> 42:50.640]  The stuff we get, you put it out in the air.
[42:50.640 --> 42:53.080]  It turns purple and turns into gas.
[42:53.080 --> 42:59.000]  It'll eat through concrete like the alien blood, you know, from a 1970-something movie.
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.200]  But it's good once it's in palm oil and in small amounts in your body.
[43:02.200 --> 43:04.360]  It's just, it's just incredible what it does.
[43:04.360 --> 43:08.440]  You've heard the rave reviews, you've seen the science.
[43:08.440 --> 43:12.120]  So because they tried to shut us down, we found another source.
[43:12.120 --> 43:16.680]  The problem is they can only get them out of certain deep wells, deep drilling wells.
[43:16.680 --> 43:20.800]  When they happen to hit it, drilling, you have to deal with oil companies that will give
[43:20.800 --> 43:21.800]  it to you on the side.
[43:21.800 --> 43:25.920]  A lot of companies just off-gas helium and stuff like that that's super valuable, but
[43:25.920 --> 43:29.640]  they're not going after helium, they're not going after pure iodine.
[43:29.640 --> 43:32.280]  So this is a finite supply.
[43:32.280 --> 43:34.240]  A, we're running out of it.
[43:34.240 --> 43:37.960]  B, we are running out of the crystals to manufacture it.
[43:37.960 --> 43:42.840]  We'll probably get more, but it's something that preserves and saves a long time.
[43:42.840 --> 43:46.840]  If you want to get your X2, now is the time because it might be sold out for a month,
[43:46.840 --> 43:50.840]  might be sold out for five months, might be sold out longer.
[43:50.840 --> 43:53.960]  I mean, the problem is supply chain, folks.
[43:53.960 --> 44:01.320]  So infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 will still have original survival shield.
[44:01.320 --> 44:07.280]  But the X2 that nobody else has got is just over the top good.
[44:07.280 --> 44:08.280]  That's what people call iodine.
[44:08.280 --> 44:09.280]  What are you talking about?
[44:09.280 --> 44:13.380]  This is real iodine, folks, not garbage and alcohol, not stuff that turns red.
[44:13.380 --> 44:19.000]  It turns electric purple blue because go look up iodine crystals online.
[44:19.000 --> 44:20.840]  They're electric blue purple.
[44:20.840 --> 44:22.480]  This is real.
[44:22.480 --> 44:23.480]  This is real.
[44:23.480 --> 44:25.000]  So consult your physician before you take it.
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.000]  It's hardcore.
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.200]  Now, Wayne Madsen will be with us 15 of the next hour.
[44:29.200 --> 44:31.360]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.160]  And I do not know his take, his view on all this yet.
[44:36.160 --> 44:37.720]  He's got a new report out.
[44:37.720 --> 44:39.120]  ISIS made the USA.
[44:39.120 --> 44:41.480]  We'll talk about that in the next hour with him.
[44:41.480 --> 44:46.080]  We'll talk to him about the Patriot Act renewal that they're trying to ram through when it
[44:46.080 --> 44:48.880]  expires Sunday.
[44:48.880 --> 44:52.920]  We'll cover it all with Wayne Madsen today.
[44:52.920 --> 44:57.720]  But Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, formerly in the NSA, is the only person I
[44:57.720 --> 45:01.360]  ever heard say that Hastert's compromised.
[45:01.360 --> 45:02.360]  We have the interview.
[45:02.360 --> 45:04.040]  Somebody should go try to pull those up.
[45:04.040 --> 45:05.040]  He's just been on so much.
[45:05.040 --> 45:06.040]  It's hard to find.
[45:06.040 --> 45:10.240]  When he, in his investigations into Illinois corruption, Blagojevic and the rest of it
[45:10.240 --> 45:12.040]  said, Hastert's the big one.
[45:12.040 --> 45:14.620]  We now learned a grand jury and doubted him last February.
[45:14.620 --> 45:19.200]  They waited till now and he joins us to give us his take on what's happening.
[45:19.200 --> 45:21.680]  We'll see if he agrees with my analysis.
[45:21.680 --> 45:22.680]  But I'll defer to him.
[45:22.680 --> 45:26.640]  He's the Hastert expert, former Speaker of the House, indicted yesterday by the Federal
[45:26.640 --> 45:27.640]  Bureau of Investigation.
[45:27.640 --> 45:30.040]  We're going to go now to Wayne Madsen.
[45:30.040 --> 45:31.040]  Wayne, go ahead.
[45:31.040 --> 45:32.440]  Okay.
[45:32.440 --> 45:41.400]  On September 30th, 2006, I first reported on my website about this past misconduct of
[45:41.400 --> 45:42.720]  Dennis Hastert.
[45:42.720 --> 45:48.000]  Remember, he was Speaker of the House, third in line under presidential succession to
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.400]  the presidency.
[45:49.400 --> 45:54.480]  If I can just read this, because it's very interesting this background of Hastert and
[45:54.480 --> 45:58.520]  how he got to his position.
[45:58.520 --> 46:04.320]  What I reported on September 30th, 2006, nine years ago, congressional sources told me that
[46:04.320 --> 46:10.360]  Hastert, while working from 1964 to 1980, as a popular history government teacher and
[46:10.360 --> 46:15.520]  wrestling coach at Yorkville High School in Yorkville, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago,
[46:15.520 --> 46:20.080]  was the subject of persistent rumors about inappropriate contact with male members of
[46:20.080 --> 46:22.000]  his high school wrestling team.
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.720]  The culture of the times usually resulted in such alleged behavior being covered up by
[46:25.720 --> 46:29.000]  public and parochial school authorities.
[46:29.000 --> 46:35.120]  The rumors were enough for his Yorkville constituency to reject him when he ran for an open seat
[46:35.120 --> 46:37.920]  in the Illinois House of Representatives in 1980.
[46:37.920 --> 46:42.560]  However, Hastert lucked out when another sitting Republican House member who represented the
[46:42.560 --> 46:46.520]  three seat district had a stroke and declined to run for reelection.
[46:46.520 --> 46:51.520]  The GOP machine bosses selected Hastert as the replacement candidate.
[46:51.520 --> 46:56.880]  Hastert served in Springfield from 80 to 86, six years to make the transformation from
[46:56.880 --> 47:00.920]  wrestling coach with that cloud surrounding himself to politician.
[47:00.920 --> 47:08.000]  In 1986, Hastert received another unexpected promotion after incumbent Republican U.S. Representative
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.560]  John Groeper was nominated by the GOP for a second term.
[47:13.560 --> 47:17.480]  He was diagnosed with terminal cancer and fell into a coma.
[47:17.480 --> 47:23.240]  The Illinois Republican convention selected Hastert as replacement on the ticket, a virtual
[47:23.240 --> 47:26.400]  election of the U.S. House and the strongly Republican district.
[47:26.400 --> 47:31.920]  So that's how Hastert got into the House of Representatives.
[47:31.920 --> 47:38.360]  He was rejected because of the rumors surrounding him as a high school wrestling coach.
[47:38.360 --> 47:48.280]  I heard from people in that particular town, Yorkville, and nearby that Hastert was caught
[47:48.280 --> 47:53.680]  inappropriate sexual contact with underage male members of his high school wrestling
[47:53.680 --> 47:54.680]  team.
[47:54.680 --> 48:00.960]  And isn't it funny, he only got into these political positions because either somebody
[48:00.960 --> 48:08.360]  had a stroke or somebody died of cancer?
[48:08.360 --> 48:15.880]  I'm just speechless here because nine times out of ten, Wayne, when I have a guest on
[48:15.880 --> 48:19.760]  like you who's predicted all this, who's broken this info, who had the courage to go
[48:19.760 --> 48:23.120]  with it, we can't find where you said it.
[48:23.120 --> 48:26.600]  But thank God you wrote about it at WayneMadsonReport.com.
[48:26.600 --> 48:35.120]  So if we can please email us that story, I'd like to flashback, republish it today at infowars.com.
[48:35.120 --> 48:39.560]  And I'd like to ask you to write a piece for us today, tying it all together and then linking
[48:39.560 --> 48:42.120]  back to WayneMadsonReport.com.
[48:42.120 --> 48:48.680]  Because it's no exaggeration, fifty times or more you have broken information that is
[48:48.680 --> 48:53.760]  just huge before anybody else does, I guess because you do old-fashioned investigative
[48:53.760 --> 48:54.760]  journalism.
[48:54.760 --> 48:58.600]  I know when you went to Illinois to investigate, you got some real serious death threats, you
[48:58.600 --> 49:04.440]  had to leave the U.S. for about four or five months, you came back and I guess the contract
[49:04.440 --> 49:09.640]  that was out on you that you were warned about at the press club was removed.
[49:09.640 --> 49:13.960]  But let me ask you this question, how have you stayed alive this long?
[49:13.960 --> 49:15.440]  I guess I'm lucky.
[49:15.440 --> 49:20.400]  I have to give you some other anecdotes about Hastert over the years, these are kind of humorous.
[49:20.400 --> 49:25.600]  I remember, first of all, when I first reported this about Hastert, this was in the middle
[49:25.600 --> 49:31.160]  of the Mark Foley scandal, you remember he was the Republican representative from Florida
[49:31.160 --> 49:37.800]  who was caught trying to solicit sex from underage male pages.
[49:37.800 --> 49:43.640]  Hastert's name also came up in the late 80s, if you recall the Washington Times, which
[49:43.640 --> 49:48.000]  is a conservative paper, broke this story about the Franklin cover-up.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.720]  And the midnight callboy underage ring.
[49:51.720 --> 49:55.320]  Absolutely, and Hastert's name came up in those rumors.
[49:55.320 --> 50:02.840]  And it's interesting because in 2006 when Hastert's name came up again in the Foley
[50:02.840 --> 50:08.360]  Pagegate scandal, the Washington Times called for his resignation as House Speaker.
[50:08.360 --> 50:15.840]  I think they also knew about his background, but it wasn't just Hastert, of course, Hastert
[50:15.840 --> 50:20.720]  was involved in trying to cover things up for Foley and included many, many other members
[50:20.720 --> 50:26.480]  of the House of Representatives, including John Boehner, who's now the Speaker of the
[50:26.480 --> 50:27.640]  House.
[50:27.640 --> 50:35.920]  And remember how Hastert became Speaker, Newt Gingrich resigned amid a scandal, and then
[50:35.920 --> 50:36.920]  Robert...
[50:36.920 --> 50:37.920]  I tell you what, Wayne, stay there, stay there.
[50:37.920 --> 50:42.560]  I want you to slowly walk through this when we come back, how it's one big nest of compromised
[50:42.560 --> 50:47.560]  individuals in the Pito Club.

[51:19.920 --> 51:24.120]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[51:24.120 --> 51:25.120]  to serve as debt.
[51:25.120 --> 51:28.640]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[51:28.640 --> 51:31.920]  currency, is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[51:31.920 --> 51:35.640]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[54:09.920 --> 54:28.280]  We just got a copy of the 2006 subscription article from WayneMadsonReport.com and we're
[54:28.280 --> 54:31.680]  going to get a screenshot of the original as well and republish it for everybody at
[54:31.680 --> 54:34.120]  infowars.com.
[54:34.120 --> 54:40.680]  I hope everybody realizes that as we're sitting here listening to WayneMadson, I don't normally
[54:40.680 --> 54:44.960]  hype stuff up like this because it's not hype, it's no brag, it's just fact, do you
[54:44.960 --> 54:52.360]  understand he went to Illinois, he did investigations, he's been there more than seven times, he
[54:52.360 --> 54:59.680]  spent months there in some cases each time and he specifically broke the news as an investigative
[54:59.680 --> 55:06.600]  journalist that Dennis Hastert was picked out of a group of compromised pedophiles to be
[55:06.600 --> 55:11.320]  brought in out of nowhere and then to be made the Speaker of the House in just a few years
[55:11.320 --> 55:17.120]  unheard of because he was compromised and he's in the same nest as John Boehner who
[55:17.120 --> 55:21.200]  you wonder why he's so under control.
[55:21.200 --> 55:29.760]  Because the mafia that runs this country gets these pedophiles, these alleged pedophiles
[55:29.760 --> 55:36.320]  and I say that with my eyes rolling and puts them in there to then carry out the agenda
[55:36.320 --> 55:41.600]  because they can be destroyed at any time and the bigger issue is why are they burning
[55:41.600 --> 55:43.080]  him now?
[55:43.080 --> 55:47.360]  Why have they activated the FBI who's compartmentalized and probably think they're doing a good
[55:47.360 --> 55:51.360]  job to go in and do this now?
[55:51.360 --> 55:54.840]  We're going to make a big deal out of this because I mean I want to win Madsen to really
[55:54.840 --> 55:59.160]  roll through how this all ties together and then we're going to put a special report together
[55:59.160 --> 56:03.360]  with his article and the headline on his article should be investigative journalist
[56:03.360 --> 56:18.280]  broke pastored molestation story in 2006, sub-headline politicians controlled via sex crimes connected
[56:18.280 --> 56:19.280]  to Boehner.
[56:19.280 --> 56:24.640]  I mean boom because the only way to stop all this is to expose the black male ring and
[56:24.640 --> 56:26.640]  how it's operating.
[56:26.640 --> 56:32.200]  We're going to break in three, four minutes but try to encapsulate it right now Wayne,
[56:32.200 --> 56:36.320]  how you investigated it, who the players are and how it's connected to Boehner as you were
[56:36.320 --> 56:38.200]  just saying in the last segment.
[56:38.200 --> 56:47.160]  Well I investigated the Foley matter that was Mark Foley, Republican from Florida who
[56:47.160 --> 56:52.320]  was actually soliciting sex from underage male pages.
[56:52.320 --> 56:59.320]  You know every decade, give or take a couple of years we had an issue mostly in the house
[56:59.320 --> 57:05.880]  but also in the Senate but mostly the house where we had this explosion of scandal about
[57:05.880 --> 57:07.720]  the pages.
[57:07.720 --> 57:15.520]  At first in the early 1980s, it first raised its ugly head.
[57:15.520 --> 57:20.480]  One of the people then who was implicated was a representative named Larry Craig who was
[57:20.480 --> 57:26.280]  then a congressman from Idaho, of course we found out about him later.
[57:26.280 --> 57:32.600]  In the late 80s we had the so-called Franklin scandal involving the Franklin credit union
[57:32.600 --> 57:39.280]  in Nebraska and again we had midnight tours as you showed earlier the headline from the
[57:39.280 --> 57:47.960]  Washington Times that was worked on by my late colleague Paul Rodriguez and got no attention
[57:47.960 --> 57:48.960]  from the Washington Post.
[57:48.960 --> 57:54.240]  As a matter of fact I should point out that my story on Hastert in 2006 was met with the
[57:54.240 --> 58:03.080]  aeration by the mainstream media then I note this morning they're all calling me up now
[58:03.080 --> 58:07.480]  for comment and my original sources.
[58:07.480 --> 58:09.560]  So I think that's kind of...
[58:09.560 --> 58:12.800]  It's huge, I'm giving you the floor when we come back in 70 seconds I want you to continue
[58:12.800 --> 58:16.480]  to lay out more on how you were saying it was connected to Boehner.
[58:16.480 --> 58:20.320]  It's clear Boehner is being blackmailed, I mean he's committing political suicide for
[58:20.320 --> 58:25.800]  the Republicans right now, he's selling the country out on the TPP, on the borders, why?
[58:25.800 --> 58:26.800]  So it's blackmailed.
[58:26.800 --> 58:35.880]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.

[59:38.440 --> 59:46.560]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:46.560 --> 59:57.280]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here live, we are going to go ahead and fade down the intro.
[59:57.280 --> 59:59.960]  We have such amazing breaking news.
[59:59.960 --> 01:00:08.840]  Last night I was downtown having dinner with friends at their condo and I called Buckley,
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:14.200]  my cousin who also lives nearby and I said well you come by with the rig, the microphone
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.400]  and the iPhone so we can do a report on Hastard.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.600]  I was going to wait until today to cover it but I decided instead to just do one last
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:27.480]  night and then after I shot the report or right before I shot the report I thought man
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:33.600]  Wayne Madsen talked about how it's all a pedophile ring and tied to this wrestling coach who
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.120]  they basically promoted so he'd be compromised.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.320]  I need to get Wayne Madsen on and of course he's being called by the media now because
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.320]  Wayne broke all this in his report.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:48.480]  In fact I have a copy of the report now you just sent me from 2006 but what was the title
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.480]  of the report then Wayne?
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:58.360]  I had several, probably about 10 reports from September 30th to October, around October
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:05.360]  the 10th 2006, the first one was major cover up suspected in GOP's page gate now Rocking
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:12.400]  Capitol Hill, Hastard's name was mentioned in that report, September 7th to 8th the rumors
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.560]  about another top GOP member of the house being involved in sexual encounters with young
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:23.680]  men for hire are confirmed to my website by well placed sources in Washington's gay community.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:35.880]  That was Hastard by the way and several other reports again all surrounding the Foley matter
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:44.920]  but I think it's important to point out that the Foley situation involved other members
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:52.800]  of Congress all running for cover and trying to hire members of Foley staff because they
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:02:00.680]  were implicated, Representative Tom Reynolds from New York, Schimpkis, Dennis Hastard's
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.680]  fellow Republican congressman from Illinois who was a member of the House Page Board.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.160]  A lot has to do with the page board, the governing body.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.440]  You know the House Page Board doesn't exist, the House Page System doesn't even exist
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:19.480]  anymore because of the Foley scandal, they got rid of it, it still exists in the Senate
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.480]  however.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:26.200]  So it's basically as best I can tell a cult of pedophiles and that you can't get in unless
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:33.360]  you're part of it and they basically like the Catholic Church taking it over and yeah.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.600]  There's a couple funny anecdotes, I mean it's a serious case.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:44.480]  I remember walking with a friend of mine and we encountered Charlie Rangel back in those
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:51.240]  days in the Rotunda and you know if you're with somebody and they kind of look at something
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.440]  and it's like an inside, they have some inside information, well here comes Hastard walking
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:04.280]  across the Rotunda with a young, very young male page, obviously you see members of Congress
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.840]  with their senior staffers, chief of staff all the time but this was very unusual and
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:17.040]  I noticed a rye smile on Congressman Rangel's face like he knew something and you know the
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:23.120]  neuro-linguistics on that one said everything and I actually had the opportunity of running
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:29.080]  into Hastard after he was speaker at the GOP convention in 2000 in Tampa, there was kind
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:38.600]  of a people traffic jam in the arena and he was standing right next to me and I looked
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:45.680]  at him and I said how's retired life treating you, Mr. Speaker, using the honorific, I know
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:54.240]  he was a speaker but it's the DC thing and he said good and then he said I forgot your
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:00.160]  name and I told him and the guy turned pale and said I gotta get back to my Illinois delegation
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.840]  so clearly he recalled the reports that I had on his misconduct back in 06.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.640]  Oh you're definitely on target and Wayne we talked about this last time you were here,
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.160]  I'm just gonna, you agreed to do it, we never hammered it out, you're hired, I wanna get
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:21.200]  you on every week, I want you writing for N4Wars, we need to talk details today because
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.200]  you know years just go by like seconds as you know and I need you on the N4Wars team
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.240]  so we're gonna get that done aren't we?
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:36.400]  Sure, sure, yeah you're right about years going by especially at 61, I feel the rest
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.400]  of the years.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.160]  Well hey listen, I mean I'm no Hastard so don't worry I'm not gonna ask you on a date
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.520]  but you lost a lot of weight man, you're looking good.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.520]  Oh well I'm trying.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.120]  No, no you're doing great, here we go.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:51.400]  Police departments and law enforcement agencies around the world have been using radar devices
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:57.680]  for a very long time but now new technology is being used that allows police officers
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:03.920]  to see and detect movement through solid walls, it requires no warrant for the cops to spy
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.520]  on you right there in the privacy of your own home.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:13.920]  USA Today is reporting that at least 50 US law enforcement agencies have secretly equipped
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:19.280]  their officers with radar devices that allow them to effectively peer through the walls
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:25.240]  of houses and it has been confirmed with the FBI and the US Marshals Services that both
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:31.160]  agencies are using this technology without obtaining warrants but of course.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:37.160]  And now there is even more advanced technology being introduced with 3D capabilities that
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.440]  are capable of being mounted on drones.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:48.440]  For more reports and today's breaking news go to InfoWars.com InfoWarsLife.com Check

[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:03.720]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWars Life line because they are
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:09.080]  not of the very highest quality or because they're not 100% organic or because they don't
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:15.080]  pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:54.320]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.560]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.600]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control, television, music, fast food, GMOs,
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.800]  sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.200]  being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.600]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.600]  drugs.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:20.640]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.680]  that children would actually like and take.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:26.240]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.840]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:36.320]  child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.360]  nutrients that taste great.

[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:55.400]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.680]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:02.280]  Wayne Madsen, an incredible investigative journalist formerly with the National Security
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:08.040]  Agency, whistleblower, testified to the EU parliament, you name it, covered Congress
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.040]  for more than two decades.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.680]  I'm very excited.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.920]  We've talked about this a couple of times.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920]  He's been here.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.920]  We've discussed it.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:17.160]  I've just never gotten it done, but we just agreed in there.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.160]  I'm hiring Wayne Madsen.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.720]  He'll still have WayneMadsenReport.com to be a full-time reporter for infowars.com.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.680]  I mean, he's one of the best out there.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.480]  We finally built this operation.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.480]  We're going on cable.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.480]  We're going on all the systems.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:32.800]  We're already picked up by a lot of cable and TV systems already.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.720]  We're on over 170 AM and FM affiliates.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.120]  What I'm doing here at infowars.com is building a true media operation.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.960]  Yes, I'm the rabble rouser.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:47.920]  I'm the pundit, but I bring you the bombshell guest, the intel, the reporters.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:55.320]  Joe Biggs is going to be on the ground at the Draw Prophet Mohammed demonstration tonight
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.120]  in Phoenix.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.200]  So all of that is coming up as well.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:09.320]  And this is what I need, four or five more reporters, a couple of text writers, a couple
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:15.760]  of guys that can do both, a couple of ladies that can do both, so that we can really cover
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:20.400]  three or four big stories simultaneously with people on the ground.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:27.040]  But it is your support spreading the word and purchasing the products at infowars.com
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.960]  infowars.com, Patriot Apparel.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:35.640]  We've got the new t-shirt when I saw PacSun got rid of their upside down American flag
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.400]  as a protest.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.320]  Well we came out one that says save America upside down flag with the US flag code saying
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.880]  when the country's in dire trouble, it's law to fly it upside down.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.920]  And on the back it says, our republic is in distress.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.200]  Ask me why, infowars.com.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.240]  Great way to start conversations, great way to educate people, it is a super bestseller
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:05.480]  t-shirt and we have it available right now at infowars.com.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:10.320]  But it's things like that that fund the entire operation, so thank you for your support and
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.400]  supporting our local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.480]  Okay, if you can, this is so big.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:20.120]  Wayne Madsen wrote, not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, we're in his archives
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:28.200]  right now in 2006 about Dennis Hastert and connections to pedophile rings and compromised
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.200]  congresspeople.
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:35.680]  He's taken from nowhere, put into the House of Representatives, accelerated into republican
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.760]  leadership that, you know, Ron Paul was there 20-something years and never got put in any
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:46.560]  leadership, put into leadership and then Boehner was under him and Boehner's connected
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.320]  to all this, so I want to specifically recap it and get into Boehner and then ask Wayne
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.680]  Madsen before we shift gears into ISIS, the economy and more.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:02.920]  This signifies trying to scare people in the republican House to get in line on the TPP,
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.080]  to get in line on a bunch of other issues.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:13.120]  So I want to ask you what you think it signifies and where all this is going with Obama's unprecedented
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.120]  persecution.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:20.440]  I'm not crying for Dennis Hastert, but unprecedented persecution of the press and others.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.440]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:28.760]  Well, I mean, we're getting into the 2016 presidential race, so we're going to probably
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:29.960]  see a lot more of this.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:37.440]  Of course, Hastert's not a candidate, but somebody who basically defended this activity
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:44.000]  is a candidate and I would just cite that at the time that I made these reports in October
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:51.040]  of 2006, the St. Petersburg time on October 4th, 2006, it's now the Tampa Bay Times reported
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.280]  on the knowledge of top Florida republicans, including then Governor Jeb Bush and Attorney
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.920]  General Charlie Christ, who was then a republican about the Foley-Hastert scandal in Washington.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.320]  And this is a quote from the St. Pete Times in a gaggle with Florida's Capitol Press
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:12.120]  Corps Wednesday, Governor Jeb Bush, flatly refused allegations posted on an internet
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:17.080]  website and circulated widely Tuesday that claims Bush, Attorney General Charlie Christ
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:21.600]  and Florida Department of Law Enforcement were all told by the Federal Justice Department
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.080]  about Mark Foley's emails a year ago, but covered it up.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:30.760]  The alleged conspiracy source to inform sources in Tallahassee who were not named was reported
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.080]  on the Wayne Madsen report website.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:37.440]  Madsen's website claims to tackle the politically incorrect and politically embarrassing stories
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.920]  and holds government officials accountable for their actions.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:47.920]  Bush responded to a question from the St. Pete Times reporter in Tallahassee about
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.840]  my report and he said, if the next governor referring to Charlie Christ who was running
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:59.240]  for the seat, to Sisi Bush, is going to have to respond to every blog and every tired little
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:05.240]  anonymous person who has some bitter part in their soul who wants to express it on the
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.040]  internet, it's not going to work.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:16.640]  One quote that was now presidential candidate Jeb Bush, his comment on the Haster Foley scandal
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.800]  at the time.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:20.720]  Why was he interested in covering it up?
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:26.360]  Well, that's the word that going back that it wasn't Reagan that had the callboys in
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:34.160]  there that it was George Herbert Walker Bush and that it goes all the way back to that
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:38.920]  and that's what the Washington Times reported hundreds wasn't it hundreds that we can pull
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.960]  the news article up the scan of it of the Washington Times wasn't it hundreds of times
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.440]  underage callboys were visiting after midnight.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:51.760]  Well, there were reports that Bush was seen at these get togethers in Nebraska where they
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:57.840]  would fly in some cases either fly child prostitutes in or get them out of Boys Town
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:03.000]  the Roman Catholic famous orphanage outside of Omaha.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.720]  Well, it also ties in doesn't it Wayne to Penn State I mean we know Sandusky is in there
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:17.080]  raping people from this you know troubled youth group at high noon on Saturdays I mean
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:23.760]  a field house on the weekend is a busy place he certainly felt like he was safe so here's
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:30.280]  the other question why are they now busting people when they've been good helpful servants
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.720]  of Sauron.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:41.040]  Well you know I mean it's the nature of Washington that place will eat their own alive and you
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:48.160]  know it's just it's getting worse and worse there because one thing about the Congress
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.680]  they used to have statesmen the worst thing you would catch them on is getting drunk
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:58.840]  in public or messing around with the prostitute of the opposite sex I'm thinking you know
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:07.320]  Wilbur Mills and Wayne Hayes and people like that but it nowadays it's getting into more
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:13.120]  of the illegal aspects which I would which is underage sex but is that because it's
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:20.000]  a club and just like in the mafia or street gangs you got to commit some horrible crime
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.960]  that people have to prove themselves and be compromised isn't that classic criminal psychology
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:29.840]  oh I think it's a blackmail operation from the word go look I mean look at some of these
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.440]  people we have David Vitter for the senator from Louisiana now running for governor I
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:40.160]  mean he was paying prostitutes he would soil his diaper and then they would scold him and
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.560]  spank him and have to clean him up I mean you know what is the matter with a state that
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.560]  would elect an individual like that to be their U.S. Senator.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:55.040]  It's coming out what about the senator Lindsey Graham I've got it from a lot of Washington
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.880]  sources that he's really compromised.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:06.520]  Oh absolutely and I mean I've said for a long time the GOP nowadays stands for you know
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:15.160]  gray old perverts and of course I've had people from the major newspaper in South Carolina
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:20.360]  which is the state out of the capital Columbia say why isn't anyone in Washington reporting
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:25.780]  on our pretty well-known gay senator Lindsey Graham who by the way publicly is anti-gay
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:32.520]  rights but how many times have we seen that those who proclaim this the loudest I mean
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:38.440]  Rick Santorum who announced the other day for the presidency once again he was a good
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.360]  friend of Jerry Sandusky at Penn State and then of course you know they all run run from
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:48.320]  these guys after they get caught as I'm sure many of them are saying about Hastert they're
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:54.920]  saying Dennis who the amazing thing is Hastert was third in line for the presidency so think
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:17:02.840]  back to 9-11 and you know although we know that was an inside operation but what if Bush
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:08.440]  had been harmed that day and Cheney became president then that would have made Hastert
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:13.240]  second in line for the presidency that's pretty scary to know that somebody that black male
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:18.840]  could have wound up in that well sure but I mean looking at Sandusky looking at Hastert
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:23.160]  it's not that they were fat I mean everybody can get fat I've been overweight they look
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:28.080]  like something's wrong with them I mean I wouldn't buy a car from them I wouldn't associate
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.880]  with them they look like deranged scum and people say don't judge a book by its cover
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.360]  no I mean you quite frankly you can judge people generally by looking them in the eye
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.840]  shaking their hand listening to them and seeing how they act I look at the Republican leadership
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:47.120]  and the Democratic leadership they look like a bunch of perverts they look like a bunch
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:54.040]  of Jeffrey Dahmers I mean I'm sorry they look like a bunch of scum right right and I mean
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:18:00.120]  and and and you know we're talking about Republicans but I'm still not satisfied that Harry Reid
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:06.480]  Dan damn near put his eye out as a result of an accident with his weight weight machine
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:12.800]  or treadmill or whatever it was you know that that defies logic Bush that kept getting beaten
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.920]  up and he had double black eyes and bloody lips he'd say fell down I mean that's not
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:24.240]  true he was the one time he he had that the mark on his cheek was for him so he choked
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:29.320]  on a pretzel he said but I heard he was very very drunk that day he was watching some football
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:39.360]  and passed out so again this for those of you viewers and listeners who think Washington
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:47.520]  is a dent of iniquity I can tell you tell them all it is I've seen it firsthand why did they
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.400]  kill the DC madam I mean I know you knew her well you help get her on the show what happened
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.840]  there I mean she wasn't talking or they just getting rid of loose ends well she had some
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:00.600]  more information she had documents she was about ready to release we don't know what
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:06.520]  happened to that by the way she was seen removing a box of documents from a condo in Orlando
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:12.280]  and taking it to her mother's home in Tarpon Springs in Tampa Bay Florida and we don't
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.200]  know what happened to that but she she had there were other other shoes that were going
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.560]  to drop in that matter I know she was trying to get out of the US and move to eat what
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.760]  was formerly East Berlin she bought an apartment over there I think it for her it was a safe
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:33.680]  house and I think it was a former CIA safe house because of the work she had done as
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:38.120]  a madam for the central intelligence agency absolutely she was probably with the central
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.160]  intelligence agency officially undoubtedly unofficially so this is how they treat their

[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:29.760]  books there ebooks and in print the classic investigative journalist the real deal I want
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:34.160]  to move out of the the whole blackmail system unless he's had other points he wants to add
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:40.160]  and get into ISIS it's so transparent that ISIS is Western funded and being protected
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.440]  and I see these headlines Pentagon is tweaking their ISIS strategy they don't know what to
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:55.000]  do it's a it's a Saudi Arabian proxy army taking over the Iraqi government has testimony
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.400]  and video I mean we knew it before it even happened we said that they were going to change
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:03.800]  the name to confuse the public and then I want to get into just other general areas but before
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:10.040]  we do that Wayne you're talking about the climate getting crazier the self destructiveness
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:14.280]  the starting stuff with China the starting stuff with Russia nobody's lionizing those
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:21.680]  countries but it seems like the elite really are bravado hoods but driven and it really
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:28.240]  is scary you know covering DC being up in DC off and on between Florida what is the climate
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:34.520]  where do you expect Obama to go in his last year and a half in office the executive power
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:43.760]  grabs I mean all of it the Republicans rolling over to everything but still being indicted
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:49.120]  what are the Democrats thinking and who's in charge well I think I think Obama's would
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:56.160]  like to speed up the clock and be out of office a lot sooner I notice he was pretty listless
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:02.000]  when he spoke yesterday at the National Hurricane Center in Miami about everybody getting prepared
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.800]  for the hurricane season I just had the impression he would have like he seemed like he wanted
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:15.200]  to be somewhere else anywhere but at the National Hurricane Center telling telling Americans
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:23.680]  to how to go and access ready.com or ready.gov or whatever the website is I think he's like
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.560]  other presidents he's looking at his post presidency the museum and library are going
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.640]  to be in South Chicago with apparently a satellite facility in Hawaii he'll have his new money
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:41.200]  laundering operation foundation like the Clintons or the Obama Foundation I would hope he won't
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:47.000]  be as crooked as the Clintons are have been with that I mean shaking down countries and
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:54.160]  companies for donations and then steering U.S. policy towards their favorite projects
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:58.640]  which apparently is what Hillary was doing I mean she's cut and dry having third-world
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.840]  dictators give her money so she allows the State Department to authorize weapons transfers
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:09.120]  this is the most criminal stuff you can imagine meanwhile they're busting Hastard for covering
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:16.840]  up some wrestler you know high school wrestler he buggered they ought to bust all of them
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:23.400]  in my opinion there's very few in Washington who I agree bust them all but how does Hillary
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:29.440]  get away with it I mean what because they love her she's look how they extol her I mean
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:37.440]  she's got she's got two challengers for the Democratic nomination who don't get any press
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:42.680]  attention hardly and when they do it's it's sort of like oh these guys are also rands
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:50.640]  of Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley from Maryland but this is how the media operates
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:55.720]  you know when I broke that Hastard story I was just I commented on that because back
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:03.480]  in 06 Anna Marie Cox who was then won cat if you recall that that blog this was her comment
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:11.000]  on my report on Hastard she said the problem is Wayne Matson just makes s word up we hear
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:19.280]  from well-placed sources that no one is having sex with Dennis Hastard well I I hope miss
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:29.640]  Cox likes her crow even though it's a cult it's served as a cold dish now but I I I'm
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:34.880]  only as good as my sources in in that case not only were the sources people in who knew
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:40.360]  about Hastard in northern Illinois in the Chicago area but members of the gay community
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:45.640]  in Washington were very open about this guy and what a you know what a basically a hypocrite
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:52.920]  he was you know supporting anti-gay rights you know moves by the house yet everyone knew
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:58.240]  that his own secret life he and you could tell body language you've seen him prancing
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:03.040]  around with his boyfriend yeah that that was that that was one where you had to be there
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:08.080]  it was myself my colleague and Charlie Rangel we just thought thought that was so odd that
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:14.480]  here is the speaker of the house with a very very young page normally those guys are back
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:20.360]  in the office working and he's acting like it's his chief of staff as closest assistant
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:24.800]  and you know as I say even Charlie Rangel looked over at that and you know had that
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:42.400]  rise smile like yeah there he goes again we're gonna be back and get into ISIS get into geopolitics
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:48.560]  and more with Wayne Madsen I'm Alex Jones stay with us we're on the March the empires
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:55.080]  shipment of live anthrax to as many as nine laboratories in the US as well as a lab overseas
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:30:00.520]  a CDC investigation of this mistake is underway and at the time there is no known risk to
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:05.880]  the general public the anthrax samples were shipped from an army facility in Utah to government
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:12.080]  and commercial labs in Texas Maryland Wisconsin Delaware New Jersey Tennessee New York California
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:17.440]  and Virginia the labs were working as part of a Pentagon effort to develop a new diagnostic
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:23.440]  test to identify biological threats in the environment dead or inactivated agents were
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:29.560]  expected but one lab reports being able to grow live axillus anthraxus the safety failure
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:34.760]  comes on the heels of increased scrutiny of bioterror agents and their oversight around
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:40.080]  the country last June more than 80 people may have been exposed to live anthrax when
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:46.560]  a CDC lab sent it by a mistake Leanne Makata reporting for info wars dot com another major
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:50.760]  health threat this one in Toledo Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:55.640]  not to drink the water Ohio governor declaring a state of emergency did you know that the
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:02.120]  average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day if there's
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:07.400]  a water emergency will you be prepared panic residents forming long lines throughout the
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:12.040]  day we're here in a supermarket in Toledo you can see the shelves empty where water

[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:13.720]  why do you want to scare people well I guess everything is from your perspective we all
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:17.560]  have different perspectives we all see through different rose color dark leases the bible
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:24.880]  says but I see a bunch of criminals taking over and being above the law and robbing
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:29.960]  the country and openly get the supreme court to rule they could start taking private pension
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:35.080]  funds and I see the very same banks doing it in every country they run I'm here raising
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:42.280]  the alarm I don't think of that as exceptional but I guess it is I think that's why we're
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:50.120]  in so much trouble it's exceptional that Wayne madson's broken so many big stories I can't
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:56.880]  even count them and what's even more exceptional is that you hardly ever hear about it the
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:01.440]  mainstream media there's some comments today going yeah Wayne madson said this in some
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:07.600]  major newspapers where are the apologies where are the apologies that I had guessed on whistleblowers
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:14.680]  like springman about the CIA ordering known terrorist into the country before 9 11 and
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:21.320]  ordering the FBI to stand down that's now in the 28 pages it's now admitted where are
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:26.200]  the apologies from glenn beckon fox news all of them they're never going to come and it's
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:33.960]  not about me it's not about Wayne madson but it is about the truth and how it triumphs
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:39.200]  and I know Wayne because I know him well he's a really good guy even though he's not bragging
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.840]  I'd imagine he's savoring not on a power trip but just savoring the fact that the truth
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:51.080]  outs the truth ends up always servicing and that after all he's gone through turning down
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:56.760]  bigger jobs money being harassed death threaded demonized attacked that more and more what
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.800]  he's written about is coming true it's a very exciting you can see clips a compilation with
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:10.000]  links to his website his new site Wayne madson report dot com at info wars dot com flashback
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:19.160]  investigative journalist broke key speaker pastored blackmail sex scandal in 2006 again
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:27.320]  investigative journalist broke ex-speaker pastored blackmail scandal in 2006 in 2006
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.920]  was involved with the cover-up of a major sex scandal involving republican congressman
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.880]  and I see a few commenters in on youtube and info wars saying why do we care about some
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:44.600]  old corrupt weirdo I'm glad he's been indicted and this isn't even a story who cares arrest
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:52.600]  them all it isn't about this molding piece of cheese it it's about the fact that they
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:58.520]  selectively are doing it why are they doing it what does it signify and does it mean they're
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:04.560]  about to roll up baner and the rest of these guys this could be a coup against who's left
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:11.960]  in the republican party and the republicans could start striking back with all their dirt
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:17.000]  this I think signifies a major war going on behind the scenes that's what it generally
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.120]  does and it just adds to this whole season of craziness I want to close the book on this
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:27.480]  again to some other big stories you're working on Wayne but in your gut your sources am I
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:33.440]  on to something here or what do you think this signifies or is it rogue FBI agents doing
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:38.720]  their job what do you think is happening this isn't over yet Alex I was I would be remiss
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:46.120]  if I didn't add that among the house leadership at the outset of this house page scandal are
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:52.440]  three current U.S. senators who two of them were members of the House at the time Roy
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.920]  Blunt who's now a senator from Missouri Shelley Moore Capito who's now a senator from West
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:04.040]  Virginia and the tutor of the house pages the tutor the person in charge of the security
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:09.560]  of these pages who apparently was either asleep on the job or knew what was going on and look
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.600]  the other way is now the U.S. senator from the state of Nebraska Ben says you got to
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:21.960]  be careful how you say that because it sounds like Ben's ass if you if you're not so it
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:26.920]  sounds like whoever runs the stable of these pages ends up getting a lot of power real
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:32.400]  quick great you mentioned that at the stabling that was another thing that I reported on
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:39.360]  back then that because the senators have larger staffs they would bring in a lot of young
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:44.240]  male staffers and and stable them that was the word that was used at the time stable
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:50.000]  them there where they would then be able to be farmed out over to the house side in other
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.960]  words I guess the senators would go over and look and see which one they like yeah it's
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:57.880]  like going to a whorehouse and picking which one you want three senators who were mentioned
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:03.240]  to me in respect to that were George Allen from Virginia Rick Santorum from Pennsylvania
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:09.800]  and Jim talent from Missouri none of them are in the Senate any longer why has this
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:14.080]  story kind of cooled off cover up because you know the Catholic Church thing just keeps
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:21.760]  coming out is every major institution infested with pedos well look I you know my for my
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:27.520]  first experience with the one that was when I was with the Navy in 1982 I was the operations
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:35.760]  officer to classified Navy facility in Oregon and the FBI and NCIS which is now NCIS it
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:41.240]  was NIS at the time came to me and said look we need you to help us investigate your commanding
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:47.680]  officer I said for what they said he's a kingpin in his child pornography ring based in where
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:54.680]  Chicago of all places and he wasn't the only one he wasn't the only military officer there
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:59.840]  were admirals involved and then of course later we you know in the later in the 80s
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.160]  we found out how high up it went right to the White House which is one of the one of
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:10.000]  the original FBI agents told me at the time when we were doing a post mortem on that investigation
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.280]  he says you know this thing goes all the way to the White House I was shocked I talk a
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.440]  lot about this with Joe Scowles and other people light side dark side government government's
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:25.040]  not our enemy but it is filled with clicks of bad guys clicks of good people percentage
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.680]  wise and you've been around the block is the government more corrupt or less corrupt or
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:35.080]  do we just know more now and it's the same and take the FBI I mean sometimes the FBI
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:38.600]  does great things sometimes it does bad things sometimes it's political sometimes it's not
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:43.080]  it's depend on the division basically what's the lay of the land from your research how
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:47.440]  many of these people are good how many are bad I think it's getting worse because in
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.960]  the old days what was the worst they would get a member of Congress on well bribes taking
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:57.280]  money you know remember Adam Clayton Powell and people like that I mean they were actually
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.840]  good congressmen for their districts but they you know had sticky fingers when it came to
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:07.720]  money well of course that's bad taking money taking bribes but now we're into the you know
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:14.920]  this really bizarre stuff I mentioned Vitter with the diaper they call him diaper Dave and
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:21.520]  and you know now this stuff with Hasterton and Foley and Larry Craig Mr. White stance
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:30.400]  at the Minneapolis men's room a stall being arrested by a undercover vice cop you know
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:35.960]  this stuff that started in the early age with Bob Baumann the Republican conservative congressman
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:41.160]  from Maryland who was arrested in a men's room and it's just gotten worse since I'm
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:47.080]  not saying that they didn't have things like this happen in the past but it certainly was
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:52.920]  not the reported by the press if it was going on but I think it's more there's more of this
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:41:00.080]  going on now from my vantage point well the issue I notice is the more fairy like a congress
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:05.240]  were a congressman is the more anti-gay they are and then they then they get busted you
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:08.960]  know out in the bathroom and I'm not bashing anybody I'm just using that term because they
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:12.880]  act effeminate they you know they act like the classic thing where you've been a grocery
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:18.520]  store and say I bet that guy's gay over there but then that's their right then it graduates
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:25.360]  into really deviant criminal stuff and I just don't get it I just don't understand it but
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:30.360]  then I guess that's who gravitates to our power what percentage and I've asked this
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:36.800]  of a lot of people in Washington what percentage are gay versus pedophiles versus heterosexual
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:42.320]  and are there more pedos in either party way or how does this work well I think you're
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:47.440]  right I think it's the ones who who wake up in the morning and start yelling and screaming
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:52.280]  about gay rights I mean what do they do they live and breathe this every day they're usually
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:58.800]  the ones that are caught you know these people I mean they have a problem and nine times
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:05.120]  out of ten you meant you know we're talking about Miss South Carolina Lindsay Graham yeah
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:10.800]  I mean there's a perfect example where everybody in South Carolina knows about him but yet
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:16.560]  he's the first one to stand up on the soapbox and and talk about how you know we we can't
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:22.960]  have the same sex marriage and all these other things so I think it you know it I do recall
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:29.360]  that one one person back in the early 80s who was going to be censured by the house
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:36.200]  for running a callboy service allegedly out of his basement of his townhouse said look
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:42.800]  you go after me I'm going to right now name 25% of the house members I know and this is
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:48.040]  back then so it was different kind of minds as Barney Frank on the house floor I was Barney
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:54.440]  Frank right exactly and and they were mostly Republicans he was talking about so obviously
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:59.960]  that you know there was no interest in pursuing that to any so that's my issue though they
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:06.560]  don't indict him but they indict Hastert is this the end you think or do you know a war
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:10.360]  a blackmail war to get the Republicans to go along with stuff because what they don't
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.240]  need to the Republicans are doing whatever they're told well I'm afraid that with all
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:21.640]  the powers that NSA has to do fishnet trawling of mega data bulk data that this is the type
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:27.320]  of thing that can result from that that they go on fishing expeditions and if they find
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:34.560]  remember they got Hastert really for failing to report currency transactions he he started
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:41.000]  the first he took out $50,000 from bank accounts and then he kept it under the $10,000 threshold
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:48.240]  if you go over 10,000 there's an automatic report made under federal banking regulations
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:55.400]  to the federal government to the IRS and others but if NSA is trolling everybody's bank accounts
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:02.280]  and transactions email what have you yeah they can get this information so I'm I'm wondering
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:07.760]  whether we're going to see a lot more of this because of the NSA power to eavesdrop yet
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:12.440]  yet some of these congressmen that are in in jeopardy and extremists are the biggest
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:20.080]  supporters of expanded NSA wiretapping and the collection of power wasn't our guests
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:24.800]  said yesterday Joe Scowles and evil always carries with it the seeds of its own destruction
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:30.000]  and it's crazy yeah these guys do what destroys them they they dig a pit for us and then they
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.440]  fall into it right they're not thinking ahead that's for that's for sure because they're
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:41.400]  they're the ones that have the most to lose because even after they leave Congress what
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.800]  happens they could become lobbyists in many cases for foreign governments that stuff is
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:51.920]  all fair game for the NSA that's right once they work for a foreign government it's open
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:58.320]  to be spot on absolutely that's another thing how does Hillary take money from dictators
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:02.160]  at the State Department through her foundation to then let them have billion dollar weapons
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:08.360]  systems that is just so over the top cut and dry right and and look she even took money
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:14.200]  from the the Fife though the World Cup sponsoring organization they of course indicted several
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:19.680]  officials see what is that about I mean you've got just incredible crime going on all over
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:24.240]  the country banks wandering hundreds of billions running the aircraft you know running white
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:29.680]  slavery rings and they're going to harass the soccer commission no no banker was indicted
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:35.160]  as a result of that settlement that now is by the new Attorney General Loretta Lynch
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:41.320]  5.8 million to steal trillions right they go after a non-US citizens are going to extradite
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:46.320]  them to the United States I think that has to do with the fact in 2018 Russia is sponsoring
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:51.800]  the is going to be the host of the World Cup and Palestine recently asked Fife expel Israel
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:58.640]  because Israel has interfered with the the Palestinian Fife teams ability to play soccer
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:06.640]  in their home territory so it may be some retaliation against Fife for that and I wouldn't
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:12.760]  put that past this administration after all what we've seen them do in rattling the sabers
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:19.680]  against Russia and now China I don't know Obama if he if he doesn't have much to do
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:25.800]  before he leaves office he ought to just identify all the neocons that stayed in this administration
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:30.080]  from the past one and fire the lot of them get rid of all of them because they're putting
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:37.520]  this country and the world in jeopardy as a result of of these policies well Putin is
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:42.720]  coming out and saying that it's basically to screw up their their hosting the World Cup
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.000]  and that's really what this all comes down to is a war on Russia and again I don't lie
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:55.200]  on ice Putin but I'm not into starting fights and the West in Soros is starting the fight
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:00.040]  and the Soros has the nerve to run around and whine and go don't you don't start World
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:10.240]  War three when when he's bragging on Fareed Zarkaria on CNN that he quote basically toppled
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:15.640]  Ukraine yeah he sort of sees a way to make money if there's a war with China or Russia
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:20.760]  he's now trying to overthrow the government of Macedonia the same way he did it in Ukraine
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:25.040]  and that that you know playing around with the Balkans remember what happened 101 years
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:31.640]  ago in the Balkans Sarajevo assassination or one World War one the war that they said war
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:37.600]  to end all wars of course it wasn't but that that's why this guy Soros needs to be put
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:44.400]  in a straightjacket and and and you know in a place like Hannibal Lecter where he exactly
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:50.560]  how comic book bad guys are one thing and when I grew up I thought there's nobody really
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:57.680]  like this until I sort of Soros I mean a weirdo Nazi collaborator at 87 years old involved
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:02.480]  toppling governments trying to put radical Islamists to control the Middle East trying
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:08.160]  to I mean he is he is he is a horrible person he's a he's the perfect James Bond villain
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:14.600]  I don't know which one he would be whether it be a blow felled or our gold finger or
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:19.280]  or or carver but he's probably a mixture of all of them put together but you know his
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:24.720]  name is Georgie Schwartz he adopted George Soros Soros it's spelled backwards and forwards
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:30.360]  the same way got Ian Fleming missed out on this guy as a villain.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.240]  Let's get into ISIS we got one more segment I really appreciate your time Wayne Madsen
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:39.400]  investigative journalist who broke the hazard news gosh nine years ago that's up on infowars.com

[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:57.880]  public that NATO's running the whole deal.
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:03.720]  Well the group judicial watch managed to get a hold of this declassified defense intelligence
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:12.680]  agency message which basically from 2012 the states that the western powers the Gulf states
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:20.200]  and Turkey should all support these radical Syrian groups to bring down Assad they talked
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:29.920]  about who they were Al Qaeda in Iraq which became ISIL or ISIS the the Muslim brotherhood
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:39.200]  and the the other the other Syrian rebel group that they called us a follow this through
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:46.040]  the Salafis yes thank you the Salafis and they're basically Wahhabis who told the Saudi
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:55.440]  Wahhabis line so here we have a proof that the US was responsible for this John Brennan
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:03.880]  is the real godfather of ISIL here's a guy who was a former CIA station chief in Riyadh
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:11.960]  Saudi Arabia is very much a pro Saudi person and and there are reports that he visited
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:16.240]  Mecca which you can only really do if you're a personal guest of the Saudi king or you're
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:24.080]  a convert to Islam and I think there was a former FBI agent who said yes Brennan did
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:28.760]  convert to Islam and we know that he remember he stay there let's break it down this is
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:33.640]  so bombshell folks you understand somebody's risking their life to give judicial watch

[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:06.360]  I got some serious threats when we did it came out four years ago and then again two
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:13.920]  years ago push the military to say no to openly arming and backing al-qaeda to take down Syria
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:17.960]  Wayne Madsen of course and many others the tip of the spear exposing that now Bloomberg
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:24.200]  reported today declassified US saw Islamic State coming let it take Ramadi what do we
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:29.080]  tell you weeks ago they're arming them the Iraqi governments caught them
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:39.360]  they're led by foreign commandos they've been trained by NATO US Israeli and other troops
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.800]  and folks that know I'm not anti-Israel I'm not anti-Turkey I'm not anti anybody but
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:50.480]  man any government that helps al-qaeda murder Christians and the Salafist same group it's
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:55.920]  crazy it's it's it just shows how evil our government is peaceful Christians by the
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.640]  hundreds of thousands are being displaced tens of thousands are being killed Libby is
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:03.800]  a failed state I want to get into that with Wayne Madsen the last few minutes here with
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:07.920]  him but first Wayne I saw on your website you got something pretty neat happening next
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:12.120]  Friday in fact if I had enough reporters or if you can get somebody you're gonna be working
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:18.640]  with us soon I'd have him walk with you live with a Skype feed and you know carry the feed
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:22.760]  on the nightly news at least or recording of it or parts of a live show you're doing
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:28.720]  something really exciting as a historian not just a former NSA guy and reporter with
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:36.040]  a spy walking tour tell us about that well on Friday the 5th of June at 930 gathering
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:43.040]  at the National Press Club at the corner of 14th and f streets in downtown DC we're
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:48.560]  gonna have a spy and scandal walking tour of the downtown area to mark the 10th anniversary
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:53.920]  of my website I can't believe I've been doing this this long but this the Hastert story
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:59.920]  brought it all back that was 2006 the second year of the website so we'll be hitting a
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:06.200]  lot of the places that I've written about and and if there's time we'll even go walk
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:12.960]  by the law firm of Dickstein Shapiro which is Dennis Hasterts law firm which apparently
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:21.800]  he's resigned from their government practices branch yesterday so there's many scandals
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:27.080]  within a few blocks of the National Press Club in the White House which is two blocks
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.840]  away so it should be a pretty good time yes see if we were a free country that this would
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:37.360]  be on nightline and we get top ratings to I mean telling the truth also gets ratings
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:41.680]  but they won't let you do it because it would destroy their whole criminal system but it's
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:45.720]  all coming to an end what do you make of even Bloomberg reporting that basically the US
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:50.120]  is working with Al Qaeda to take over Iraq I mean this is insane and take over areas
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:56.000]  of Syria no it's clear this this whole operation was to start it with getting rid of Saddam
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:04.200]  and then Qaddafi and Libya and now Assad in Syria Yemen now a mess a civil war all those
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:09.680]  governments were secular and now they're we run the risk of them being replaced by these
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:19.160]  Salafist regimes where as you say they not only kill she is other Sunni Muslims Christians
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:28.760]  and other minorities but also destroy antiquities priceless irreplaceable world heritage sites
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:34.160]  execute women if they get caught not wearing gloves I mean give me a break man our government's
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:40.120]  funding people that sexually mutilate women and make them wear gloves I'm done I'm done
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:44.800]  with the scum that runs our government and you know this defense intelligence leak that
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:49.480]  shows people inside are really upset too right Wayne yes because I looked at that that message
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:54.560]  and unusually the header information you know the from we don't know where it's from that's
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:58:01.080]  been blacked out some of the some of the action and info at ease at the top of the message
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:05.280]  have been blacked out normally they don't black that out but they let the bit remain
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:13.120]  about the U.S. and Israel and Western Europe Turkey and the Gulf States Saudi Arabia and
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:19.560]  Qatar supporting these radicals to overthrow us military is just really upset I think the
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:34.040]  globalists have gone too far Wayne Madsen thank you so much God bless you it's good

[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:20.560]  is an understatement they're exploding quite literally volcanoes all over the place going
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:27.240]  off earthquakes in alaska earthquakes in california it's just when it rains at pores william f
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:31.840]  jasper the editor of the new american magazine consummate researchers going to be joining
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:40.200]  us on tpp on globalism on political correctness on all of it just the jaw dropping stuff
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:46.400]  that's going on but i wanted to play a clip of julie and assigns and look i'm not attacking
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:55.080]  assigns but i'm sick of it okay wiki leaks these are released the entire tpp and understand
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:01:01.040]  they threaten to go after him even more of he does so but they only released the part
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:05.680]  that google once released and i think i've seen some evidence that assigns all these guys
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:10.960]  are kind of connected into that some of these other power arms that don't they don't want
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:16.480]  the web totally taken from them so they'll allow one section to be released about just
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:19.560]  the end of internet freedom as we know it and that's been known for a year and a half
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:26.120]  now it's really helped us almost beat this this sovereignty killing garbage but then
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:32.560]  assigns goes only five of the 29 sections are about traditional trade yeah it's a total
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:40.120]  takeover so why don't you release it let's go ahead and play the clip it's a the largest
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:49.720]  ever international economic treaty that has ever been negotiated very considerably larger
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:57.080]  than after it is mostly not about trade only five of the 29 chapters are about traditional
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:05.000]  trade the others are about regulating the internet what internet internet service providers
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.040]  have to collect information they have to hand it over to companies under certain circumstances
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:17.800]  it's about regulating labor what labor conditions can be applied regulating whether you can
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:25.280]  favor local industry regulating the hospital health care system privatization of hospitals
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:30.680]  it's global takeover essentially every aspect of the modern economy if you like to gang
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:36.240]  raping that's how much you're going to love it are in the TPP that's right and that's
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:43.920]  good so that basically the entire world system because it ties into the EU and the NAU is
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:49.000]  regulated by this and Congress is just going to let them create new master law that we
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:55.560]  can't see that after its past directs everything and then unelected boards make the arbitrations
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:00.480]  and decisions I mean that is just totally being conquered read the Declaration of Independence
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:05.760]  what they complain about foreign unelected bodies making decisions this is the same thing
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:14.680]  why don't people get angry we're being conquered by crooks a bunch of pedophiles let's let's
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:21.000]  let's go to the other clip here it is what if the government does or a state government
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:27.760]  decides it wants to build a hospital somewhere and there's a private hospital has been erected
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:33.720]  nearby well the TPP gives the constructive the private hospital the right to sue the
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:40.840]  government for the expected the loss in expected future profits this is expected future profits
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:47.040]  this is not an actual loss that has been sustained but it's desired to be compensated to take
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:51.840]  over public infrastructure about the future and we know it's the opposite of free market
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:57.560]  similar instruments where governments can be sued over free trade treaties that is used
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:04.560]  to construct the chilling effect on environmental and health regulation law for example togo
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:10.040]  austria that's right but it's selectively enforced they're all being sued by tobacco
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:15.080]  companies philip morris let's stop there and again it has this environmental stuff that
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:20.520]  claims this environmental but ignores gmo toxic waste dumping radiation but the very people
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:26.120]  that are passing carbon taxes these big banks oh that's all in there oh it will but the carbon
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:34.640]  taxes is there don't worry because it's pure bull to surveil and tax every area of human
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:40.320]  activity and when we got the last treaty documents from Copenhagen during that UN summit it would
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:47.520]  basically double taxes on the third world so it will kill them police departments across
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:54.520]  the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays which use cell phone
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:05:02.440]  towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants the technology comes courtesy
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:08.800]  of the FBI who have forced our nation's police departments into signing nondisclosure agreements
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:14.440]  forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology needless to say this is a direct
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:19.800]  violation of our fourth amendment and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingrays
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:26.280]  spying where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:31.840]  who are not even suspected of any crimes once again more evidence that the police state

[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:21.400]  alex jones williams jasper editor of the new american magazine new american dot com i cannot
[02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:26.840]  think of a group of organization that's done more long term to get america in a fighting
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:32.280]  stance to try to defeat the globalist takeover doesn't mean we're going to win but the john
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:35.400]  burtz society i'm not a member of it but i tell you everything they've done has been
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:42.240]  on target that's why they've been so demonized and attacked leon f jasper was in college back
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:46.960]  during the vietnam war when his parents who were people he really respected patriots go
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:52.760]  from memory i think world war two vets you name it his dad were saying you know the vietnam
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:57.480]  war is wrong and he thought well this is kooky craziness he was a conservative i'm gonna go
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:01.600]  look into this and he got sold on it ended up being of course one of the top guys over
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:07.200]  there at the new american magazine the new american dot com i'm telling you who he is
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:10.920]  if you don't know who he is for our giant audience that grows by the day because people are finally
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:17.360]  starting to get concerned he's been writing a lot about the tpp the trans pacific partnership
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:21.320]  and of course they warned back in the seventies when bary goldwater did of the trilateralist
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:26.360]  plan of david rockefeller jimmy carter was a big to brzezinski to get the leaders of
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:34.840]  asia the european union which is today and the american union together to transfer governmental
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:42.320]  power into non-elected secretive corporate quasi-governmental boards so we're being conquered
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:48.480]  and these are totalitarians on top of it and now we're told it's secret you can't see it
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:53.160]  so people are finally getting upset on the left and in the libertarian constitutionalist
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:59.400]  right but reporters have gone out including our reporters my son went out yesterday and
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:04.880]  basically no one knew what tpp was and then they got angry that a child you know a twelve-year-old
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:11.160]  knew and they did a reporter in time square new york no one knew out of more than twenty
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:16.000]  people they talked to and that's not even so much the public it's that the controlled
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.880]  media won't cover it they know all about kim kardashy and they don't know about that so
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:25.880]  i want to get into all those issues i want to get into a u.s economy contracted big time
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:34.800]  i want to get into the just over the top bombshell information that's old news here but now the
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:42.720]  defense intelligence agency documents been leaked last week that yes the west is running
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:47.640]  the salafist and the al-qaeda and the other groups it's ninety plus percent al-qaeda it's
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:54.440]  Saudi arabian ryan it's simply over the top and now bloomberg u.s. saw islamic state coming
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:11:00.520]  let it take ramani well i mean we told you that but now it's in the news today bloomberg
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:09.920]  so our own military this is you're pushing it too far our own military is now they rebelled
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:15.120]  two years ago saying no air force for al-qaeda in syria ted cruise came out ram paul came
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:20.200]  out that was a sea change moment my view of real awakening the public may not know which
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:24.440]  planet they're on on average but the military understands that we're putting people in there
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:30.040]  blowing up churches killing priests murdering children i mean this is really dirty and i
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:34.760]  think they've gone too far especially if we push this and get this out so that all ties
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:40.760]  together then i got ices created to remove Assad and now be a proxy army and then they'll
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:46.400]  use the threat to take liberty here our own job eggs is on a plane right now he'll be
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:52.640]  getting there beforehand to cover at six o'clock tonight in phoenix the protest outside of
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:57.440]  mosque on the draw Muhammad free speech demonstration regardless of what you think of that it's free
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:03.320]  speech ices is valid to attack this is the mosque where two of the terrorists that got
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:08.880]  taken out in garland went to see the globalist want to clash of civilizations but not one
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:15.160]  preemptively so we'll get william f jasper's take on that william i've thrown out a kind
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:20.040]  of a grab bag of issues here but they all tie together overall i think there is a huge
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:28.320]  awakening happening i want to get a tpp with you but what do you make of the good leaks
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:32.720]  that the government's admitting are real they're very upset the criminals in the government
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:38.320]  that think we're so stupid that we're going to stand by and let them publicly fund al-qaeda
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:42.960]  and change the name to ices to confuse us and have them commit war crimes everywhere
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:49.720]  i mean this this is really i think jumping the shark what do you think well alex you're
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:58.880]  so right and i have to commend you for popularly getting this out there to so many people because
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:07.200]  we've been trying to report on this for years and actually decades showing how our government
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:13.440]  has been funding virtually all of the enemies that have that we've been called to go to war
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:19.520]  against over the last several decades whether it's the war on drugs or whether it's the
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:26.840]  war on terror or whether it's uh cases like going to war against saddam hussein back in
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:34.600]  the 1980s we at the new american were writing against railing against ranting against the
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:41.120]  u.s. government republican and democrat funding saddam hussein pointing out that he was a
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:48.720]  villain he was a bad guy we shouldn't be helping him and billions of dollars tens of billions
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:55.000]  of dollars went to build him up then when it was his time to be taken out we were told
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:01.760]  we had to sacrifice our sons and our daughters and our treasure to go over there and take
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:06.800]  him out for the new world order so and then and then we didn't even do that we let him
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:12.560]  stay in there again so that we so that we could resurrect that that plan again so this
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:19.840]  has been happening over and over again and i'm sure you've had my colleague alex newman
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:29.200]  on your show he's done a lot on the background of isis and uh isis al-qaeda and libya and
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:36.200]  uh yemen and all throughout the maghreb in the middle east yes we've had him on about
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.520]  tpp but i should get him back on about that because he's specifically broken it down for
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:44.920]  your excellent publication that folks can subscribe to or read the articles the new american
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:51.440]  uh dot com uh shifting gears out of that tpp again uh they've they've rammed it through
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:55.920]  the senate but now it's got to go to the house and we've got all these blackmail scandals
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:15:01.560]  firing up right now i guess to get the republicans to get in line it looks like um do you want
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:07.560]  to cover the attempt to ram it through first or what's in it well uh we can try to try
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:12.680]  to do both but i i think it was uh the comment that you made right at the beginning about
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:18.760]  your son going out and asking people about it uh that's been my experience other than
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:27.320]  in uh select conservative and liberal slash progressive leftist and environmental circles
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:36.480]  uh very few people have heard about the tpp or the ttip uh just for uh i know your most
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:43.560]  of your listeners may know but the tpp stands for trans pacific partnership uh the ttip
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:51.760]  stands for trans transatlantic trade and investment partnership these are the two mammoth uh so
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:56.840]  called trade agreements they're not even trade agreements and we can get into some some quotes
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:04.040]  on that they admit the the uh public officials the u.s government officials and the think
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:11.640]  tank gurus who helped put them together that these are not trade agreements they are partnerships
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:20.040]  they are economic and political convergence and integration schemes that is to these twin
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:26.680]  schemes for the pacific trans pacific uh oceanic area and the transatlantic oceanic
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:32.280]  area are to bring together economically and politically much in the same way that we've
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:40.240]  seen in the in the european union the economies and political systems of the united states
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:47.200]  and these other countries with the tpp uh we're talking about currently 12 countries
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:54.640]  australia brunai canada chili japan malaysia mexico new zealand peruse singapore the united
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:17:03.920]  states and vietnam the pacific rim countries well the tpp is just a transition stage to
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:09.920]  what they have planned further which is called the free trade area of the asia pacific which
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:17.600]  will be made even larger so that's the scope of the tpp uh the ttip of course would combine
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:23.840]  us the united states uh and eventually canada mexico and north america william we've got

[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:50.400]  were getting into the the the uh the atlantic treaty and then the tpp both that then take the three larger unions
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:56.640]  and start harmonizing them i mean this is the plan that berry goldwater warned up in the 60s and 70s
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.440]  here it is and whereas you can't get the public to get upset about being conquered by corporate
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:08.240]  chieftains they do seem to get hey why can't we see the plan why is it so secret i mean it's it's
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:15.360]  so classically totalitarian well yes and that's one of the areas where we've been able to get some
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:24.000]  traction on because it is so blatantly obvious and audacious that uh they would be uh carrying out
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:32.800]  these negotiations in secret uh completely uh off the off the record off the books except for those
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:40.080]  privileged cleared participants private parties lobbyists representatives of some of the biggest
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:47.360]  corporate interests in wall street uh who are allowed to to not only have access to these
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:55.040]  documents which have been underway for many for several years now uh but our legislators whom we
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:26:03.600]  elected uh are not allowed to have access to them except in very controlled restricted conditions
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:09.680]  you and i are not allowed to have any access to them other than those copies that have been leaked
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:17.440]  uh to the public illegally so you and i have to rely on illegal copies or references to them
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:23.200]  made by the u.s trade representative and isn't that justice inverted where we're criminal if
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:29.520]  we're looking at wiki leak stuff when our government's being taken over we're being taken over in
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:36.480]  secret i mean that's just asinine that they would even try this well and i'm still waiting for some
[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:44.720]  senator or congressman to take advantage of being able to go down to the secret room in the bottom
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:51.840]  of the capital uh where they have to surrender their cell phone and all other communications devices
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:59.360]  and then go into a special room they have to they uh then are monitored they may not make that rule
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:04.640]  say see how we're already these kept creatures who said it's secret i'm still waiting for one of these
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:10.960]  congressmen to say well go ahead and arrest me what are you gonna do i i would like for one of them
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:17.360]  to do that get arrested for trying to represent the people and tell them what it is you're uh
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:21.680]  you're going to be subjected to you know you're a real expert on this i've tried to understand
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:26.560]  it they've been developing this treaty as you know for 10 years how did they get it to the point
[02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:31.280]  where congress is convinced they can only go look at it in secret and can't tell anybody i mean
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:39.280]  i mean we're already run by these foreign groups right they can only do this alex because they have
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:44.800]  gained control the globalist the one world's have gained control at the top of both parties the
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:49.280]  leadership of both republicans and the democrats and i'm sure i'm not telling you anything new there
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:58.480]  but um i mean this is the uh strange world that we are in now where we have the top leadership
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:04.320]  patch and mcconnell and ryan and uh the others in the house and the senate republicans
[02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:13.040]  conniving with the obama administration and john carrey uh to pull this over on the american
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:20.400]  people together with the help of virtually all of the aligned globalist corporations that are in
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:29.360]  the council on foreign relations the u.s uh business council the uh global business dialogue that uh
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:39.120]  trans uh atlantic policy network and others of these uh globalist business alliances and so they
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:46.080]  have a tremendous amount of clout there because government has we've allowed government to get
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:52.880]  so big that it now has all these goodies and benefits to hand out and it has all these clubs
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:29:02.880]  to hammer people into submission so uh we have uh today the republicans jumping on board with this
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:10.400]  and convincing many of the conservatives that hey this is the thing to do that uh this is
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:16.640]  going to help business and trying to convince uh the american conservatives that because it's
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:22.000]  it's benefiting these huge corporations goldman sacks et cetera stay there that come back we
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:25.920]  gotta go to break come back because that's how they're pitching it well global government's there
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:30.000]  so we better go ahead and just join it so we have our say that's the trap and then how do we
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:37.360]  beat it stay with us i'm alex jones william f jasper is our guest we're on the march the empires

[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:22.240]  then Volvo changed their story and said it was the fault of the owner who failed to activate

[02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:16.080]  guest that's the flagship magazine of the whole media system that the john burs society has and
[02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:23.040]  if they helped wake my dad up in the sixties and his friends and then i kind of had that in the
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:26.960]  background when i was a child even though my dad wasn't really heavily involved in any of that when
[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:33.040]  he was older helped me see the world and wake up and and do what i've done haphazardly for 20 years
[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:38.160]  and i've reached exponentially more think how many people we've reached that are going to end up
[02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:44.400]  having a big effect so the globalists are racing all this through because they know a lot of forces
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:49.040]  are piling up against them that's my view we'll see if william f jasper agrees with that but
[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:58.960]  but he got cut off by the break getting into will they be able to pass it or even if they
[02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:04.720]  can't pass it will they just have presidents and prime ministers by executive action implement it
[02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:09.520]  because their argument is hey these treaties are done we have to do it as henry kissinger
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:15.360]  wrote a month ago george soros wrote two weeks ago in these op-ed pieces that we covered we're not
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:21.120]  joining globalism enough larry summers did as well all the usual suspects that maneuvered us into
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:28.080]  this crisis their answer is hey you're losing at the gambling table double down or hey the heroin
[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:33.440]  didn't get you high take more because they're managing it and getting the power out of it
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:38.960]  they are the villains you've got george herbert walker bush all these usual suspects talking
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:44.800]  about their new world order we see what it means and then the very one tenth of one percent that
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:52.160]  engineered the destruction of free market and all these poor indigent people then invoke race war
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:57.600]  and class war as a class of civilizations to get us all fighting with each other while they rob us
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:02.560]  so i want to get into tpp where it's going how they're pushing we've got to join it to stay
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:08.320]  relevant and then i want to get into social engineering that william f jasper uh as a child
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:17.280]  psychology and a degree an education from university of idaho as well as other letters
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:22.800]  with his understanding of all this because he writes a lot about it where the social
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:27.840]  engineering aspect is going and what type of world they're going to build if they're successful
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:34.240]  so william f jasper go ahead you've got the floor well thank you alex uh we were talking about
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:40.720]  about what was happening with the tpp how they were getting it through congress and you know with
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:50.080]  these business alliances such as the uh business round table and the transatlantic uh uh partnership
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:59.440]  uh the transatlantic policy network etc uh they have put together a huge lobbying force
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:07.840]  of corporate power and they are able to swamp uh just about any of the congressional districts or
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:17.600]  senators uh uh states uh with the uh uh lobbying force that they can they can bring to to bear there
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:23.120]  and they can promise them as many of the previous senators and congressmen have found that once they
[02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:30.560]  leave office they will have a very lucrative uh career uh with one of these corporations or with
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:39.040]  one of the think tanks or uh one of these uh coalitions so uh there's a big incentive there when
[02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:47.440]  we have all of this at stake for these congressmen to completely consciously sell out or to just
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:53.600]  simply deaden the uh conscience that they have there and pretend that there is no real threat
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:57.760]  here because what we're we're talking about is i've tried to make clear in in my writings is
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:04.480]  an existential threat an existential threat to our sovereignty our independence to our constitution
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:12.000]  to our liberty uh we saw uh very very good uh premonition of that really concrete proof of
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:18.880]  that a couple of weeks ago with the may 18th ruling by the world trade organization against the
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:26.800]  united states against a law passed here by our congress the country of origin labeling cool
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:34.480]  which is uh simply stated uh foreign meat products have to be labeled as foreign meat when they come
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:40.320]  into this country so that americans can decide okay i'll i'd rather have american meat which already
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:48.080]  has enough uh concerns for for for most of us or i can buy it from from mexico will let me throw the
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:56.400]  cat out here again william f jasper the editor of the american magazine uh is our guest i'd been
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:02.560]  breaking down global government how unelected corporate bodies that are secret are now making
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:08.400]  decisions and and basically trying to veto our laws please continue sorry about that uh
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:21.040]  uh so uh we see that they are are um actually uh moving to uh give the world trade organization
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:25.920]  authority or rather our congress is willing to now knuckle under to the world trade organization
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:34.960]  as a response to to the world trade organizations ruling congress didn't say well go take a flying
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:42.640]  leap uh try to enforce it no immediately the next day uh the house agriculture committee
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:47.120]  got together and said oh i guess we have to change our our law we there's nothing we can
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:56.880]  do about it so uh they already introduced legislation with 60 some sponsors to cave
[02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:05.600]  into the wto which was a lawsuit brought to the wto by another free trade agreement so
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:15.920]  called nafta uh by canada and mexico uh they used uh nafta to claim that simply us labeling
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:23.760]  us requiring that foreign meat be labeled was a violation of free trade and caused them harm
[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:32.160]  and so it had to go now uh this is a big enough issue even in its own right because uh we we should
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:39.200]  have a right we do have a right to uh even if one agrees with the legislation or does not
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:45.280]  we do have a right to pass our own laws and to uh require that those sure products coming into
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:51.920]  our country should uh follow the these guidelines sure it circumvents our own circumvents our own
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:57.120]  laws william f jasper i just put an article up on screen you're a tv viewer out there where the
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:04.080]  e u is ordering countries to take massive asylum seekers out of africa and other areas in as if
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:10.400]  it's their responsibility to pay for it i mean this is globalism go ahead yes i mean so we can
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:17.680]  we can be sure because there are already hundreds of other cases pending before the wto and nafta
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:26.400]  courts uh we can be sure that when the tpp and ttip if they are passed that we will see many many
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:36.320]  more uh lawsuits like this brought before the tribunals the judicial bodies of the ttip and
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:44.560]  the tpp and or to the world trade organization because frequently these uh preferential trade
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:50.800]  agreements pta is which is what what they call these uh free trade agreements frequently these
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:58.640]  are bumped up to the wto or sometimes countries elect to begin at the wto wto is a really an adjunct
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:06.800]  of the united nations and it is a it has been from the very beginning the key institution of the whole
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:13.440]  new world order it's the judicial branch of the new world order and these this judicial branch
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:18.320]  operates much in the same fashion that our own judiciary does here in the united states in this
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:26.560]  past century it acts as a subversive force to legislate from the bench and so we see that happening
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:33.520]  already and what's even what's even more dis uh disarming about this is that here we have right
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:40.880]  at the beginning both the tpp and the ttip architects the politicians and the gurus who put
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:50.000]  it together are referring to both of these documents as living evolving agreements meaning as they
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:57.520]  explain and as we've quoted them at length that regardless of what they say it means today the
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:02.400]  agreement and we don't even know what that is because we haven't had an officially released
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:10.000]  document but even once it is released because it is a living evolving document that means that it
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:16.480]  will mean whatever they say it means or whatever a tpp or wto judge and this is key if if folks
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:21.600]  just join us i'm going to interject here because just like obama care or any other new law they
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:26.400]  passed that are these big ominous bills it's just open into they do whatever they want
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:32.560]  they have a name for that it's called basically dictatorship oligarchy uh basically rule of
[02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:38.400]  the elite diplomatic community for the big hedge fund heads we see the world they're building
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:46.640]  of total inequity selling it under the idea of equality it's just over the top and then if you
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:51.600]  pull back from it the this happened yesterday morning i was at the gym and state senator rodney
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:58.640]  ellis big democrat comes in the only two ellipticals in there of a big line were by me he gets on and
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:06.480]  then a state rep tre martinis gets up and they start talking for 15 minutes while i listen
[02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:11.280]  about how great it's going to be and how stratford and the cia are advising them
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:17.280]  on how wonderful in a few decades or even sooner and you know five to 15 years they were talking
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:22.480]  about how they'll be able to run for office in mexico city folks can run for office in texas
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:27.360]  and canada now it's going to be one union they didn't say gee all those conspiracy theorists
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:33.680]  were right who got the documents you know 20 years ago or 10 years ago with damp canada
[02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:40.000]  no uh no it was just oh it's so cool oh and it's so cool we get advised and they weren't even
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:44.880]  villains martinis was talking about how interesting it was and how cool it was that you know the cia
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:49.920]  advises the department of public safety uh through dr freedman and all this and how
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:54.960]  needed is so it's sold like it's this new great thing you know we get to be under and and then
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:44:01.440]  he gets to advance and he doesn't want to aspire to be part of the federal government no no you
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:07.360]  aspire to be part of the global government as you were saying you just join with these corporations
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:12.880]  and there's this new place for you in the future on these corporate boards and then i looked up the
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:18.400]  senator he's on the main ut board he's on everything and they're just going yep mm-hmm like it's just
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:24.960]  fun there's just no discussion no nothing oh they know all about the tpp it's a fun new thing
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:30.160]  they know all about the na u it's a fun new thing and listen i'm not even saying these guys are bad
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:37.200]  people they've just so standardized it that we already can't see secret agreements that run
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:42.240]  our lives because we're already under global government now they're just going to start
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:48.400]  unwrapping it unveiling it unpacking it and deploying it do you agree with that statement
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:56.960]  very much so and in fact you see this is what americans have to come to understand uh very quickly
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:03.920]  that this process has been underway now for decades and it has the fruit is beginning to be
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:13.200]  quite obvious uh we now have many foreign corporations that own much of the uh the infrastructure and
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:20.000]  and uh corporate uh infrastructure here in the united states many people's jobs are dependent
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:26.880]  upon these companies many of the american companies uh do not consider themselves american companies
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:33.680]  they consider themselves globalist citizens of the world they believe in globalization and globalism
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:40.000]  and in a borderless world many of them are in favor of actually doing away with borders which
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:46.800]  is part of the tpp it hasn't come out yet uh but there is a whole chapter dedicated to immigration
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:54.880]  and the immigration is pointing the the immigration policies are pointing to the same as we saw in
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:46:03.840]  the korean free trade agreement that president obama uh presided over which has greatly increased
[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:11.120]  the l1 visa uh guest workers the so-called temporary guest workers that become permanent
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:17.680]  and uh president obama boasted that this was uh responsible for bringing hundreds of thousands
[02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:24.240]  of uh new immigrants here into the country temporarily and then of course they never
[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:30.240]  have to leave uh now so this is leading us toward what we've already seen in the european union
[02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:37.520]  where it is impossible to stop migration immigration all of a sudden becomes migration and now
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:42.640]  they're standardizing and saying you will pay by law hundreds of thousands a month you will go
[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:49.360]  along with it yes and they they uh as you know the number of the countries have tried to say
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:56.160]  well hey we're not going to pay welfare for these uh these people it's called welfare tourism
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:47:01.440]  where these migrants come in and then they just uh stay there they come in as tourists or as
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:06.800]  business class people and then they just stay there and cnn publishes travel guides so how the
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:13.440]  chinese can come here and get on welfare yeah and so that that is happening on a huge scale
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:20.240]  and of course that opens up all kinds of problems in here we still have uh we still have the the
[02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:26.960]  capability of of saying no you can't go here we can in spite of uh president obama we can
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:34.880]  have them kicked out if they are here illegally once we become part of a uh north american union
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:46.800]  once we become part of a fta of a fta a p which is the whole pacific or the tpp ttip then uh any of
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:54.480]  those uh people who are at risk of being decorted can bring a lawsuit as we saw happened in in england
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:59.760]  with the romanian who woman who was on welfare there she said no i have a right to be here and
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:08.480]  and the court backed her up so uh immigration is a huge issue or or migration a huge issue in the
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:14.400]  tpp that hasn't been touched yet as you as you pointed out the vast majority of of americans
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:23.440]  still have not heard of either the tpp or ttip these are huge huge existential threats these
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:30.160]  are going to affect every aspect of every one of our lives and the only reason we haven't heard from
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:37.280]  them is that there is this huge conspiracy in our media to keep everybody dumbed down to keep
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:42.480]  these things which should be top news issues so that we can intelligently debate them make
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:47.840]  intelligent decisions we can't do that if we don't even know about them and the news media is not
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:54.960]  doing it's it's performing its watchdog service obviously if they are not even reporting on the
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:49:01.760]  fact that uh that our government officials are keeping all of this secret i mean that should
[02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:08.080]  be a top story every day you should be seeing uh all of the news anchors out there demanding to
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:13.520]  know of obama why why isn't this being released demanding to know of john carrey they know they
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:18.720]  give them all these softball questions whenever they're up they're up there and they don't even bring
[02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:27.360]  this up again william f jasper is our guest i'm i'm i'm i'm looking online at my film in-game blueprint

[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:22.880]  in in globalist organizations pointing out that that he's for a complete uh union with the united

[02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:59.920]  they were simply repeating what had been done in america and the eu on a larger scale the accord
[02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:05.920]  states that the two blocks will aggressively push regulatory convergence in more than 35 areas

[03:00:02.640 --> 03:00:07.600]  the tpp i mean look obama is already pretty much open the borders up they're doing it all
[03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:14.320]  about fiat but they want it on paper these big shadowy boards so they can share liability
[03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:19.600]  and and and basically mitigate it and where they can shut down markets shut down their competition
[03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:23.600]  you were trying to get into that and talk about solutions yeah where foreign companies can operate
[03:00:23.600 --> 03:00:30.240]  here and be exempt uh this is a get out of jail free card this is new titles of nobility
[03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:36.240]  this is just like the un giving itself diplomatic community this is the new royalty this is the
[03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:43.680]  antithesis of the renaissance or the american system and is flaming authoritarianism i don't
[03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:50.400]  see how anyone would support this william f jasper well yes i mean and we didn't even mention we
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:56.640]  don't have time to go into the possibility even likelihood that obama would slip some gun control
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:01:00.080]  measures or ammunition oh they said they will sure talk about that for a minute than solutions
[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:05.520]  yeah uh uh you know you might want to get michael hamman general counsel of gun owners of american
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:12.400]  if you haven't had him on he's been uh looking into this uh he tried to get and others tried to get
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:20.240]  republican leadership in the house and the senate to stipulate to to provide that uh
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:26.000]  and to prohibit uh obama from putting anything in the trade agreements that would in any way affect
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:33.680]  the second amendment they refuse to do that so uh we can't count on if if people are misplacing
[03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:39.280]  their trust here for the republican leadership from mcconnell and hatch and those guys uh to
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:46.080]  watch out for that they're not they've already sold out so uh there are uh you know when we do
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:53.360]  the nose counts there are enough people out there who are still um susceptible to pressure from the
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:58.560]  public they'll fear it if they get enough people out there at their meetings and they start hearing
[03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:06.720]  enough from the from the uh boots on the ground that uh they better uh not vote for it we saw that
[03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:15.200]  you know people wrote off the free trade area of the americas ftaa you might recall uh a decade ago
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:20.800]  and uh we had a big campaign on that i went to a number of to miami into a number of their uh
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:27.120]  big conferences you might have also and uh a lot of people say hey that's gone it's not we're not
[03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:31.680]  going to be able to stop it even many of the people on our side said that's a done deal they got too
[03:02:31.680 --> 03:02:36.800]  many lined up on their side it was all the same people all of the same cfr globalists proud all
[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:44.160]  the big corporations but they didn't have the votes because our side put enough pressure on them
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:48.560]  they that that some of the people who were going to vote for it backed out we saw the same thing
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:53.920]  as you know with the spp the security and prosperity partnership for north america which was the nascent
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:59.120]  n a u the north american union and in their words they said the answer is integration by stealth in
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:04.000]  the bamf documents so they're still trying it but we're holding them back yes and that's where
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:09.600]  that's where these people never give up we have to we have to hold them off and then expose them
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:14.480]  and route them out eventually or they will just keep coming back with these again and again
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:21.680]  very well said uh how are we doing worldwide i mean in your view is humanity really starting
[03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:28.080]  to wake up or is it uh not enough of a response for how fast the globalists are moving i mean how
[03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:37.040]  are you feeling in your gut at it on a human level uh it is not very uh it is not very encouraging i
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:42.800]  asked this of my colleagues around the world and i've just recently been in touch with a number
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:49.200]  of people in an interviewed people in europe and most of them although there are people waking up
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:57.600]  there they don't have anything like we do in terms of alternate media in terms of programs like yours
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:04:08.960]  talk radio of organizations on on the the moral issues whether it be pro life pro gun oh and getting
[03:04:08.960 --> 03:04:15.280]  back since i mentioned pro gun keep in mind that virtually all of the countries on both sides of
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:21.360]  both oceans there that we would be aligned with have very strict gun controls and they're gonna have
[03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:28.880]  votes on these boards with the future of the documents incredible absolutely and so uh so we're
[03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:34.000]  we're it right here really this is where the battle is going and so people that think they're
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:38.800]  going to leave here and go to another country no this is it william at jasper we're out of time
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:44.800]  great job the new american dot com thank you so much
