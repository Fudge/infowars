[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:23.240]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies
[00:23.240 --> 00:27.480]  and gentlemen welcome I am not Alex Jones I happen to be Jason Burmese and I will be
[00:27.480 --> 00:33.120]  filling in today Sunday and then all the way through Thursday as Alex begins to venture
[00:33.120 --> 00:39.480]  off to the DNC very exciting stuff in fact he was up promoting that on a I believe was
[00:39.480 --> 00:43.800]  Peter Boyle's radio show maybe able to get that on a stream later today and we'll be
[00:43.800 --> 00:49.600]  playing that hopefully in the third hour or fourth hour but basically he got on with
[00:49.600 --> 00:55.440]  Luke of We Are Change and Jonathan Elinoff of We Are Change who will be joining us later
[00:55.440 --> 01:04.040]  today as well against one of the founders of Recreate 68 and apparently got very heated
[01:04.040 --> 01:08.320]  so I'm very anxious to hear that we're going to be talking about building seven it's all
[01:08.320 --> 01:15.760]  over the place made CNN last night of course the mystery is solved the mystery is solved
[01:15.760 --> 01:22.840]  apparently you know it wasn't scooped out the fires weren't that hot but a center beam
[01:22.840 --> 01:29.480]  expanded and there was a disconnect I believe on the 13th floor just one of these many many
[01:29.480 --> 01:35.080]  columns and zero resistance just everything began to fall inward and that's why the facade
[01:35.080 --> 01:40.160]  of the building fell with the internal structure apparently according to S. Siam Sunder and
[01:40.160 --> 01:49.520]  his ragtag band of NIST cover-up artists the CNN piece does show our Infowars reporter
[01:49.520 --> 01:54.320]  Shane Geiger who's going to be joining us as well today asking part of his question
[01:54.320 --> 01:58.120]  what they don't show is where they turn the lights off on him and basically do not answer
[01:58.120 --> 02:03.120]  his question I mean you could tell they don't answer his question from this New York Times
[02:03.120 --> 02:07.560]  article where they basically say that first they lie and say no one died in World Trade
[02:07.560 --> 02:11.400]  Center seven we've just proven that on several occasions there's mainstream reports of a
[02:11.400 --> 02:16.480]  couple people dying but we all know Barry Jennings first account which is in Fabled Enemies
[02:16.480 --> 02:22.040]  and you can check that out I think the most of the Barry Jennings interview is posted
[02:22.040 --> 02:26.200]  with a little bit of context for a preview of Fabled Enemies right now and remember you
[02:26.200 --> 02:30.520]  can pre-order that at infowars.com it's going to be available at prismplanet.tv on August
[02:30.520 --> 02:36.680]  31st but they say it was ridiculous and there was no way so they didn't even look at it
[02:36.680 --> 02:43.800]  you know it's skeptics of questions if explosives were planted in at seven World Trade Center
[02:43.800 --> 02:47.760]  as well as the Twin Towers and the Pentagon the Pentagon you know why do they even bring
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.920]  the Pentagon in it's ridiculousness as the Bush administration was seeking a justification
[02:52.920 --> 02:58.120]  to invade Iraq and Afghanistan what started as a small small number of such conspiracy
[02:58.120 --> 03:03.080]  theorists has only ballooned into a movement of sorts largely fed by internet sites that
[03:03.080 --> 03:07.780]  promote the theories and then they try to say you know one in seven Americans just make
[03:07.780 --> 03:14.240]  up a number I love how they just make up a number well we're gonna get into that big
[03:14.240 --> 03:20.080]  time today I mean ah man you know Wolf Blitzer gets up there and he's so smug and he's like
[03:20.080 --> 03:27.240]  mystery over we know why seven fell they didn't even have any steel from seven to use in these
[03:27.240 --> 03:34.400]  tests these are computer models made to do what they want you know I took 3d modeling
[03:34.400 --> 03:40.280]  and I'll bet anything that they did not rig any kind of physics into these things it's
[03:40.280 --> 03:45.560]  just a model and it represents I guarantee it's an animation it's nothing more because
[03:45.560 --> 03:51.600]  the physics is proven it it's wild but you know what the debunkers will now harp on this
[03:51.600 --> 03:55.480]  this is the I believe the fourth or fifth version of the story and this will be the
[03:55.480 --> 04:00.960]  new talking point for the debunkers of thermal expansion coming up in the next segment we
[04:00.960 --> 04:09.040]  have Benjamin Fulford the former Forbes editor an expert of really the eastern ways I guess
[04:09.040 --> 04:13.400]  it's gonna be interesting to talk to him after of course China having the Olympics
[04:13.400 --> 04:17.560]  out there I don't know if everybody out there caught the opening ceremony but very bizarre
[04:17.560 --> 04:23.840]  very much blurred the line between reality and fantasy by them super imposing things
[04:23.840 --> 04:30.320]  on the screen such as fireworks I mean we've all we've all seen the lip syncing that's
[04:30.320 --> 04:35.640]  kind of you know blaze but they they took to another level plus I want to get us take
[04:35.640 --> 04:39.920]  on the situation over in Georgia and Russia it's Benjamin Fulford on the other side this

[08:20.760 --> 08:27.480]  jones all right folks we are back i am not alex jones once again i am jason bermas one of the

[08:32.120 --> 08:37.720]  called fabled enemies we'd like you to get that too it's it really goes into the international
[08:37.720 --> 08:41.560]  intelligence organization that carried out nine eleven doesn't really focus on the physical
[08:41.560 --> 08:47.960]  anomalies but it really does trash the report from building seven yesterday right now joining
[08:47.960 --> 08:54.040]  us we have benjamin fulford he was the former asian bureau chief of forbes magazine he's also
[08:54.040 --> 08:58.520]  written for the south china morning post in a variety of other high-profile publications
[08:59.640 --> 09:02.680]  we're going to talk to him about global affairs today how are you benjamin
[09:02.680 --> 09:10.200]  fine fine how are you i am very very good so right into it i i want to get what the japanese
[09:10.200 --> 09:15.400]  people's take is on this russia georgia situation i mean people are really in this country still
[09:15.400 --> 09:20.680]  believe that you know russia is the demon and they attack georgia mercilessly and you know the
[09:20.680 --> 09:25.880]  bear is back but we know that uh... u.s special forces were in georgia there was a sneak attack
[09:25.880 --> 09:31.320]  on south osiria which really amounted to an attempt to bloke ethnically cleanse the region
[09:31.320 --> 09:35.720]  and russia was just reacting well
[09:35.720 --> 09:40.120]  i mean they you know the situation in japan is a bit similar to the u.s where you have
[09:40.680 --> 09:47.400]  a large brainwashed public that just believes what their media is telling them and you have
[09:48.280 --> 09:53.480]  a significant group of people who know the truth and the people know the truth know that
[09:54.440 --> 09:59.160]  this was an american provocation but more specifically they know that
[09:59.160 --> 10:07.800]  what's happening is we're dealing with a very very dangerous situation where we have a group of
[10:09.480 --> 10:15.640]  neo nazis who controls u.s who are in deep trouble and they're trying to dig themselves
[10:15.640 --> 10:22.520]  out of this trouble by starting world war three or trying to and so the government and the elite
[10:22.520 --> 10:29.800]  people are aware that these people are cornered they're dangerous and they're trying to somehow
[10:29.800 --> 10:36.760]  create a provocation to start world war three and give them an excuse to impose martial law in the
[10:36.760 --> 10:42.360]  u.s. well that seems to be what is coming down to i really hope that they do not achieve their
[10:42.360 --> 10:46.600]  goals it seems like there might be a de-escalation there but what you're telling me is that the
[10:46.600 --> 10:51.160]  general population over there also thinks that russia is the aggressor in this situation and
[10:51.160 --> 10:58.920]  i really just not aware what's going on well i think the aware segment is larger than in the u.s.
[10:58.920 --> 11:07.560]  but uh... unfortunately the mainstream newspapers and television are following the u.s. line right
[11:07.560 --> 11:15.640]  now i mean in terms of the the majority you know the the major media well i mean you've had uh
[11:15.640 --> 11:21.400]  fujido over there who has you know gone before his uh... part parliament and basically brought up
[11:21.400 --> 11:25.800]  nine eleven truth i was wondering what the situation is with that is that progressed any i mean
[11:25.800 --> 11:30.840]  obviously the world trade center seven this report came out yesterday of course they said it was
[11:30.840 --> 11:35.320]  fire uh... even though it was hundreds of degrees less than they had previously thought and they
[11:35.320 --> 11:39.320]  said that the damage to the building didn't really matter and it was only one beam that
[11:39.320 --> 11:46.440]  detached after thermal expansion but this caused a perfect symmetrical collapse uh... i mean look
[11:46.440 --> 11:55.000]  you know the people who are totally brainwashed will will clutch any straw they need to you know
[11:55.000 --> 12:03.720]  keep their illusionary world around them right but anybody who knows what's going on knows
[12:03.720 --> 12:09.720]  and has known for a long time this is a bunch of bs so do you think there will be any progress
[12:09.720 --> 12:15.160]  over there on the uh... issue of nine eleven truth what's happening here over here is that we
[12:15.160 --> 12:23.560]  have a government that was set up by the cia and the remnants of the uh... military regime of of
[12:23.560 --> 12:30.120]  world war two and that regime is coming to an end they're they're delaying they can delay the next
[12:30.120 --> 12:36.040]  election until september of next year but our opinion polls show that they are on the way out so
[12:36.040 --> 12:41.400]  what's happening is we're headed for a major regime change here in japan and so the opposition party
[12:41.400 --> 12:47.240]  that that has supported the majority of the population they are aware of the situation and
[12:47.240 --> 12:52.440]  there will be truth commissions all that sort of stuff once this regime is out of the way
[12:53.320 --> 12:57.320]  well what kind of power do you think will be given to those kind of commissions i mean obviously
[12:57.320 --> 13:02.600]  we won't have a a war crimes tribunal much like the hay i mean i just don't see that happening i mean
[13:02.600 --> 13:08.120]  well there'll be a truth commission like they had in south africa now basically people will be named
[13:08.120 --> 13:14.760]  but nothing will be done well you know they'll be named and and shamed and then when you see
[13:14.760 --> 13:19.080]  nothing will be done i mean you have to look at it this way i mean they won't be able to do this
[13:19.080 --> 13:27.960]  anymore but here in japan the the same people who were behind 9-1-1 have been financing certain
[13:28.760 --> 13:32.280]  CEO right wing groups who function much like the german brown shirts did
[13:34.120 --> 13:41.480]  and they've been murdering politicians and um members of the media as well as
[13:42.840 --> 13:47.320]  industrialists in order to keep their sort of control over this country for the past 60 years
[13:47.320 --> 13:53.080]  and that will be exposed well i certainly hope so because we've only seen more censorship i mean
[13:53.080 --> 13:58.280]  in the last few weeks uh info wars and prison planet have been uh blocked in large segments
[13:58.280 --> 14:03.640]  of the united kingdom alex actually did a big contest to uh make viral videos to make people
[14:03.640 --> 14:09.480]  aware of this and you know i see that crackdown happening in this country a little bit soon i
[14:09.480 --> 14:15.160]  don't know what it's like over in japan how censored is the internet right now well not very
[14:15.160 --> 14:23.800]  i mean uh the the current regime is sort of like reluctantly following u.s orders to the minimum
[14:23.800 --> 14:30.440]  necessary with the greatest delay possible um that's sort of their policy they did right
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.760]  to appear like they're following their their official line without really wanting to do it
[14:34.760 --> 14:40.440]  you know that's what's happening here um you gotta remember the u.s is sort of like the heart of
[14:40.440 --> 14:47.080]  darkness things look worse from the worst from the point of view of within the united states
[14:48.120 --> 14:54.040]  well i didn't know today was not going to uh alex jones was not going to be here but
[14:54.040 --> 15:00.120]  there was an issue i wanted to bring up with him because i feel that he has been manipulated by
[15:01.480 --> 15:10.120]  cia propaganda when it comes to china well how so you have in particular i wanted to
[15:10.120 --> 15:17.640]  discuss falon gong okay falon gong is not a typical religious organization okay it's a syops
[15:19.000 --> 15:26.040]  a very big one and it's run by a guy called elliot abram who is a convicted criminal
[15:26.040 --> 15:35.320]  in the iran contra affair and you can prove that uh falon gong is a syops just by looking at
[15:35.320 --> 15:45.160]  their financing look at their bimonthly uh called epoch times and see who publishes it and why it's
[15:45.160 --> 15:52.520]  published in seven languages and they have sound of hope it's a radio that they broadcast which is
[15:53.240 --> 15:59.240]  helped by the broadcasting board of governors you the same people as behind the voice of america
[15:59.240 --> 16:07.960]  radio style radio marquis in other words it's uh it's a cia front and put in place by elliot abram
[16:07.960 --> 16:13.400]  and then we have a television thing called new tang dynasty and again it's also cia finance so
[16:14.040 --> 16:20.760]  whatever al jones says you know they are the chinese or fascist regime and the u.s is headed
[16:20.760 --> 16:31.960]  for the same path he is unwillingly you know spreading cia propaganda well i mean i certainly
[16:31.960 --> 16:37.800]  don't want to be more like china i feel like you know china is somewhat of a police state the
[16:37.800 --> 16:43.800]  military and the police are one and the same i mean i mean being to china i have not been to
[16:43.800 --> 16:50.440]  china i i can that's why you don't understand you go to china okay and hang out in the street with the
[16:50.440 --> 16:57.960]  chinese and see what's like to live there and then talk about it okay the fact is that when it comes
[16:57.960 --> 17:04.920]  to the average chinese now they are freer than the average american now it is true they don't have this
[17:04.920 --> 17:11.480]  big parade and this big fake show called democracy has done the u.s but you're you're aware enough
[17:11.480 --> 17:19.000]  now that it's a totally rigged uh bs show in the u.s right i mean oh absolutely but i just think
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.480]  that there has to be some kind of a separation between the military and police and once you lose
[17:23.480 --> 17:29.000]  that i mean you get into dangerous territories i mean they openly sell dissidents organs on the
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.840]  on the open market in china okay the thing about this whole for example falun Gong dissidents organs
[17:34.840 --> 17:44.040]  thing okay now that has been proven to be false okay there was a u.s cia fake story about that
[17:44.040 --> 17:49.000]  and the chinese invited the international media to visit the hospitals and so supposed to be
[17:49.000 --> 17:55.160]  taking place and whatever it is true that for a while they were selling the organs of condemned
[17:55.160 --> 18:02.120]  criminals okay yeah and this became a source of major criticism and they put an end to it
[18:02.120 --> 18:06.760]  okay but the idea that they're taking falun Gong people and and just telling their organs
[18:06.760 --> 18:12.600]  and organs and torturing them that has been proven to be false well i'll have to look into it i mean
[18:12.600 --> 18:17.160]  uh i'm looking at the epoch times right now they're talking about organ harvesting china's labor
[18:17.160 --> 18:21.480]  yeah again i mean and you're saying that that is a cia paper of course you're gonna read
[18:21.480 --> 18:27.480]  shit like that i mean stuff like that i'm sorry okay um well you know again i i'm i don't know
[18:27.480 --> 18:31.480]  enough about it and you kind of put me on the spot here for that so i'll have to look into it i gotta
[18:31.480 --> 18:38.840]  tell you i i can't see myself comfortable in a more eastern eye society i see i i see both
[18:38.840 --> 18:44.200]  cultures kind of gravitating towards one another which scares me i mean in the last 20 to 30 years
[18:44.200 --> 18:49.720]  i mean we're talking about blue jeans coca-cola over there obviously a lot of uh you know
[18:49.720 --> 18:55.320]  westernized eateries or whatever and over here i see more of a police state and i'm sorry i just
[18:55.320 --> 19:00.040]  don't know if i would be comfortable with again the military being the police especially the way

[24:32.280 --> 24:37.640]  to listen in so alex you have the floor hey guys now i'm the one that told my producer to get
[24:37.640 --> 24:43.720]  benjamin back on i like mr. fulford and uh i'm here getting ready to go to denver packing up and
[24:43.720 --> 24:47.880]  taking care of business for the show in the background and i think it's been misrepresented
[24:47.880 --> 24:53.480]  what i say and what i do a similar thing is what tarpoli did last year when i had uh former ca
[24:53.480 --> 24:59.320]  section chief and black cop commander e-hour hunt son on st john hunt and he released that tape on
[24:59.320 --> 25:05.960]  our show and the relic stone also covered it just saying as far as he knew the chain of command went
[25:05.960 --> 25:12.920]  all the way to president lbj and people said oh alex says it went to lbj and no higher no that's a
[25:12.920 --> 25:18.760]  misrepresentation with our witness and the tape and the written transcripts and affidavits
[25:20.040 --> 25:24.520]  he's saying that's as high as his chain of command went so that's as high like in a mob
[25:24.520 --> 25:30.040]  organization and we were investigating it as high as our investigation went obviously we know lbj
[25:30.040 --> 25:37.560]  was a puppet to big banks in texas world a lot more now on the subject of china uh china has
[25:37.560 --> 25:42.760]  medical firms that advertise they sell organs they carried out the attacks uh in tennum and
[25:42.760 --> 25:47.320]  square and that's true china doesn't have as many face scanning cameras though they're putting in
[25:47.320 --> 25:52.760]  national ID cards of chinese governments announce that people's daily and so the west has a bigger
[25:52.760 --> 25:58.440]  grid in place a police state grid and secret police they just haven't started the mass arrests
[25:58.440 --> 26:03.640]  and executions but i mean the chinese government websites with the public executions and the
[26:03.640 --> 26:09.960]  line of people up and shooting them in the work camps uh now is is is china generally as bad as
[26:09.960 --> 26:14.680]  we're told certainly not a hundred been to china i've just interviewed hundreds and hundreds of
[26:14.680 --> 26:19.080]  experts people who are even pro china i've had a lot of guests on like yourself mr fulford that
[26:19.080 --> 26:23.000]  you know tell us all about it uh you know as troglodytes over here that have never been around the
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.800]  world uh the point is is that uh instead of this i mean i understand you are the authority but you're
[26:29.800 --> 26:35.880]  a guest here and so uh we just have you here to give attention to your website and what you're
[26:35.880 --> 26:41.880]  doing we're not spreading cia disinformation i mean i think putin's bad i say china is bad
[26:41.880 --> 26:47.320]  i ran a lot of bad things most governments are evil and corrupts we're not saying us good china
[26:47.320 --> 26:53.560]  bad here and uh so that's my bottom line you said they're not uh you said they're not uh harvesting
[26:53.560 --> 26:58.600]  organs i mean that that's just not true well no they used to be doing it okay that's a fact and
[26:58.600 --> 27:04.600]  they they investigated once it was reported and they put into it um but their original thinking
[27:04.600 --> 27:08.520]  was well this guy's going to be executed anyway why don't we take his organs and but then there
[27:08.520 --> 27:12.840]  was some corruption and there was an investigation you gotta remember it's a country of 1.3 billion
[27:12.840 --> 27:17.720]  people no and a lot of funky stuff will happen among that many people i know the chinese government
[27:17.720 --> 27:21.960]  says Mao was bad and evil and his wife was bad and they imprisoned her and most americans don't know
[27:21.960 --> 27:26.920]  that for killing 60 million i know china's gone through changes i know everybody's well i think
[27:26.920 --> 27:32.840]  imagine if you were okay during Mao's era okay you could not choose what you wore you could not
[27:32.840 --> 27:39.320]  choose what you read or information and you could not choose where you lived what job you did okay
[27:39.320 --> 27:45.800]  that was how it was a real police state and that's not what i'm just saying i know history
[27:45.800 --> 27:50.120]  i knew you'd say that and that's true so our modern image of china is the great leap forward the
[27:50.120 --> 27:55.240]  culture revolution the little red book they're becoming a more high tech grid like we are you're
[27:55.240 --> 27:59.960]  right for a while in many i mean i mean they had riots there as you know when i put surveillance
[27:59.960 --> 28:05.080]  cameras in the farmers with pitchforks are beating armed police so i'm not disagreeing with you i don't
[28:05.080 --> 28:13.000]  know who told you that i uh was saying that uh okay anyway look the fact is that it is not a
[28:13.000 --> 28:19.480]  democracy however the people who will now run the show okay they're the direct heirs of dung
[28:19.480 --> 28:29.640]  shell pink and joe and lie okay now joe and lie was a member of the secret society and they have
[28:29.640 --> 28:34.680]  beliefs that are very very similar to christianity and they want to help the weakest in the store
[28:34.680 --> 28:41.320]  and the poorest and the fact is that you know for the vast majority of the chinese life has
[28:41.320 --> 28:46.440]  gotten a lot better over the past 20 years no i don't ask and are you saying that it's the same
[28:46.440 --> 28:52.760]  secret society that launched the boxer rebellion well yes i mean what what you have in china it's
[28:52.760 --> 29:02.280]  it's a very interesting situation you they've always had an official um public worldview
[29:02.280 --> 29:09.640]  like the mainstream media have in us but they've also had a secret worldview that has been opposed
[29:09.640 --> 29:17.160]  to it and they've had this for thousands of years and so when the official view becomes
[29:17.160 --> 29:22.440]  two out of touch with the people there is a massive peasant revolt there has been throat history
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.400]  and also happen in the middle ages in europe peasant revolt that's what castles were built
[29:27.400 --> 29:31.960]  of course to protect against the local service for the nobility look i'm gonna let you go

[33:22.120 --> 33:28.040]  with benjamin fulford and uh... benjamin i want to get your take on uh...
[33:28.040 --> 33:32.680]  where china's power is going to be in the world because i see them on a grander stage now
[33:33.240 --> 33:37.640]  after the olympics uh... what do you think i mean tarpley's one to say that our next big
[33:37.640 --> 33:42.200]  conflict is going to be with china i i hope that's not the case i want to get your take on it i was
[33:42.200 --> 33:48.920]  obsessed with the idea uh... as a youth that world war three would be between the west and china
[33:48.920 --> 33:54.200]  now i was sure of it that's why i came over here when i was nineteen that was twenty eight years ago
[33:55.400 --> 34:00.760]  i've been living in asia this much time i speak chinese and japanese and i've been visiting china
[34:00.760 --> 34:06.360]  i went all over the you know and talk to their leaders and leaders in japan after all that time
[34:07.480 --> 34:12.760]  i have come to the conclusion that china is not a threat you gotta think of china like a beautiful
[34:12.760 --> 34:18.040]  woman or a handsome man who wants to have children with you and make love to you and they're only
[34:18.040 --> 34:23.480]  hurt you if you hurt them first and that is something that you know i didn't come to
[34:24.680 --> 34:29.480]  over to you know immediately took me decades of studying the place and being there to understand
[34:29.480 --> 34:35.160]  this so from that perspective and i think if you talk to anybody who's been out here for
[34:35.160 --> 34:40.200]  twenty years or speaks a language they'll agree with you they're not a threat they really are not
[34:40.200 --> 34:47.960]  um and the regime that was under mao was a new world order type regime controlled by the
[34:47.960 --> 34:54.520]  luminati in the current regime is not i got much else i guarantee you um i'm not saying they're
[34:54.520 --> 34:59.080]  perfect you know there's a lot of problems there but right now i'll be honest to you i'd rather
[34:59.080 --> 35:03.640]  live in china than i would in the u.s. well things are getting pretty scary in the united states
[35:03.640 --> 35:07.800]  there's no doubt about it i mean we'll see what happens at the dnc but it looks like it's going
[35:07.800 --> 35:13.320]  to be martial law there well here's what's happening uh with the um with the united states and this is
[35:13.320 --> 35:19.000]  very very important this is one of the reasons i want to talk to you people is that um on september
[35:19.000 --> 35:26.840]  30th okay that's about a month from now the united states the government is going to go bankrupt
[35:26.840 --> 35:31.320]  according to many sources of mine at the end of the fiscal year for the u.s. government and
[35:31.960 --> 35:39.640]  the bush regime and the neo-nazi faction that we you know as neocons are cornered okay they are
[35:39.640 --> 35:45.240]  are in deep trouble they have been isolated from the west of the secret government of the west
[35:45.960 --> 35:49.480]  and they're saying to them look you've stolen a bunch of money from england you've stolen a
[35:49.480 --> 35:53.640]  bunch of money from europe you've stolen a bunch of money from the whole world and you have until
[35:53.640 --> 36:00.600]  september 30th to pay back they don't have that money and they're hoping to use that occasion of
[36:00.600 --> 36:08.600]  bankruptcy to start martial law in united states and they have 190 000 mercenaries working for black
[36:08.600 --> 36:13.640]  water who earn a thousand dollars a day who are they're going to be the troops who are supposed
[36:13.640 --> 36:19.080]  to impose martial law in the united states now the whole world is concerned about this and i'm very
[36:19.080 --> 36:23.880]  concerned about this and there are a lot of forces who are lining up to try to stop this from happening
[36:23.880 --> 36:32.840]  in the u.s. now they try to start world war three over iran and that didn't work they were now the
[36:32.840 --> 36:39.480]  the talk is that they're going to try to provoke russia into attacking poland and they put these
[36:39.480 --> 36:46.040]  outdated patriot missile defenses in poland as a provocation but the real story is they want the
[36:46.040 --> 36:51.400]  russians to attack so that they can unleash their star wars weaponry they have in space
[36:52.280 --> 36:58.120]  and they want a few russian nukes to get through before they start this whole you know operation
[36:58.120 --> 37:04.600]  of pulverizing the russia but in other words they are people who have survived by fomenting wars
[37:04.600 --> 37:10.280]  and selling weapons and they are cornered and the only way they can think of getting themselves out
[37:10.280 --> 37:15.480]  of the hole there of their end is to start world war three so the important thing is not to give
[37:15.480 --> 37:22.520]  them any excuse to start world war three we have to get them step aside peacefully and to all those
[37:22.520 --> 37:29.320]  blackwater mercenaries i would like to say right now if you really want to kill your own people
[37:29.320 --> 37:35.560]  go ahead and do so but we'll offer you twice the pay twice what they're paying you to stop them
[37:36.440 --> 37:42.040]  that's an offer you come to china mr the head of blackwater whatever we'll pay your mercenary
[37:42.040 --> 37:50.120]  double not impose marshal on behalf of the brish nazi faction well it's definitely going to be a
[37:50.120 --> 37:55.480]  privatized military faction that does so if they do declare marshal on this country uh you know i'm
[37:55.480 --> 37:59.800]  quite alarmed by the fact that halibur and move their main base of operations out of the united
[37:59.800 --> 38:04.360]  states and into dubai do you think that these people will start to leave the country before
[38:04.360 --> 38:09.960]  this disaster happens you're saying september 30th september 30th is a date a lot of people
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.720]  have been telling me is is a crucial date because of this apparently the bis the bank for international
[38:15.720 --> 38:21.400]  settlements which is based in flitland which is always been known as headquarters central the
[38:21.400 --> 38:30.280]  secret government has split with the the bush faction and the the the nazi faction that control
[38:31.240 --> 38:38.200]  well they control the uk canada uh in the united states and australia at this point so you feel
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.280]  like the continuity of government program the shadow government bunker government in this
[38:42.280 --> 38:47.560]  country has now parted ways with the the bush faction even though in the 80s uh you know george
[38:47.560 --> 38:52.840]  herbert walker bush is the one that restructured the entire cog program through the national
[38:52.840 --> 38:58.680]  programs office into cia fema all these other agencies and it was really the birth of the
[38:58.680 --> 39:03.080]  sole source contract only instead of actually just you know putting it out there like haliburn
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.720]  did it was kept under wraps it was really a beginning of a new era of black ops and you're
[39:07.720 --> 39:11.880]  saying now that faction is out because they've just been too outlandish in the last eight
[39:11.880 --> 39:17.800]  years well what i'm saying is that there's a significant group within the united states
[39:17.800 --> 39:23.320]  inside the intelligence establishment that are opposed to these people and they're very
[39:23.320 --> 39:28.280]  concerned they've been telling me that they have either arrested a killed 20 air force generals in
[39:28.280 --> 39:37.160]  the past month and they're worried about a similar purge at the pentagon uh so in other words a lot
[39:37.160 --> 39:42.600]  of these people at the super secret programs who've been off you know exploring the universe
[39:42.600 --> 39:46.680]  and doing whatever they had not be too concerned are suddenly very very worried and opposed to
[39:46.680 --> 39:51.320]  these people and they've been asking for help from the rest of the world so what i'm saying
[39:51.320 --> 39:56.840]  is that the secret government of the u.s. the black ops people are split now between what you
[39:56.840 --> 40:03.160]  could call the white hats and the black hats i mean that so you know enough of them are really
[40:03.160 --> 40:08.040]  really worried about september 30th and they really have had enough of these nazis and that's
[40:08.040 --> 40:14.200]  what they are they discovered documents at the end of world war two uh written by the nazis
[40:14.200 --> 40:20.600]  which said for us the war never ended and they've been plotting this uh turning the u.s. into a
[40:20.600 --> 40:28.120]  fascist nancy republic ever since and as you know the bush's grandfather was a major financer of the
[40:28.120 --> 40:33.480]  nazis and they brought over all the nazis after world war two in an operation called operation
[40:33.480 --> 40:37.320]  paperclip the ones who couldn't be brought to the u.s. or sent to south america they've been
[40:37.320 --> 40:42.280]  plotting this for a long time well you're correct on that there's no doubt that through union banking
[40:42.280 --> 40:47.400]  and others press cop bush funneled nazi money before and after world war two into this country
[40:47.400 --> 40:52.440]  he was arrested under the trading with the enemies act uh by jadgar hoover and yeah you're correct
[40:52.440 --> 40:57.880]  again on project paperclip which is still not all the way declassified i mean our entire
[40:57.880 --> 41:05.000]  on you know open nasa program i guess is based on nazi rocket technology i mean we brought a lot
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.320]  of them over there's no doubt about that there's no doubt that they follow these nazi like uh
[41:09.320 --> 41:13.640]  beliefs a lot of them come out of the school skull and bones where they literally eat off
[41:13.640 --> 41:19.960]  of hitler silverware so you know i don't really put anything past these guys i i just you know
[41:19.960 --> 41:25.960]  obviously september 30th is not that far away we're talking about a really a two month not even a
[41:25.960 --> 41:32.120]  two month a one month time frame here yeah i mean the good thing about having this day is that it's
[41:32.120 --> 41:38.440]  it's a it's a clear measure i mean you you know indicator like it's not something vague right
[41:38.440 --> 41:45.880]  but uh the same people have been warning me since last summer right so last summer there was a you
[41:45.880 --> 41:52.760]  might recall constant sort of screaming about iran and they were stopped by the people in pentagon
[41:52.760 --> 41:58.040]  from attacking iran and now they're still trying to provoke something but this time it's with russia
[41:59.240 --> 42:06.040]  but i believe that there was actually a majority in the cia the nfl all these black ops people
[42:06.040 --> 42:14.120]  who basically are sick of these nazis so i i am i do believe that there will be a coup d'etat
[42:14.120 --> 42:18.600]  against them and that's the people who've been contacting me who want to stop these people
[42:18.600 --> 42:23.640]  before they do their crazy stuff after september 30th so do you believe you don't even think there's
[42:23.640 --> 42:30.760]  going to be an election this year then well it all depends i mean uh apparently there's
[42:31.640 --> 42:38.760]  the united states is in a very deep financial crisis and uh the people who cause this crisis
[42:38.760 --> 42:44.120]  with bankrupt the united states do not want an election they want marshal law they want to put
[42:44.120 --> 42:50.200]  turtles off in as a dictator and they're looking for an excuse uh and if these people are allowed
[42:50.200 --> 42:54.760]  to get their way they will not be an election but if the majority within the intelligence
[42:54.760 --> 43:00.920]  communities and the pentagon stuff stop them then there will be an election and eventually
[43:00.920 --> 43:07.080]  we'll have these people then arrested and they'll be a uh you know the the brainwashed masses will
[43:07.080 --> 43:12.680]  finally be given access to the truth well my worry is even with an election i don't see barack obama
[43:12.680 --> 43:17.800]  saving us man i i see him as another side to the same coin i mean he you know he went down to
[43:17.800 --> 43:23.320]  bilderberg uh right when it happened he snuck away from the press corps for this he's got brzezinski
[43:23.320 --> 43:29.480]  or had brzezinski on his team uh you know of his of advisors uh i think he's slick he doesn't
[43:29.480 --> 43:34.760]  really say a lot he seems to toe the party line and i feel like he wants expansion in eurasia
[43:34.760 --> 43:40.520]  and uh his speech in berlin was downright scary where he said that the global citizen would be
[43:40.520 --> 43:49.400]  expected to do more not less in the future well he's definitely a hired actor reading a script
[43:49.400 --> 43:56.920]  um now he works for the left wing of the cia which is the people under brzezinski and their crew
[43:58.520 --> 44:06.440]  but i don't think in the end of the day it really matters because the u.s is no longer
[44:06.440 --> 44:15.160]  going to be able to call the shots uh you see what the reason why the u.s is over finished is the
[44:15.160 --> 44:22.200]  superpower is very simple if you look at history any superpower that relied on debt ended quickly
[44:22.200 --> 44:28.120]  the spaniards they they their empire is based on debt they collapsed swish empire is based on
[44:28.120 --> 44:34.360]  debt and it collapsed united states has been asking the rest of the world to finance them for 40 years
[44:34.360 --> 44:41.720]  now it was a long time when they believed the u.s was a benevolent force they liked the americans
[44:41.720 --> 44:47.480]  and they were happy to pay for them to be the the world's uh police but that situation has ended
[44:48.200 --> 44:52.360]  they don't want to keep financing these people because they have been become the world's number
[44:52.360 --> 44:57.000]  one source of terrorism i mean the united states is a rogue state that's how the rest of the world
[44:57.000 --> 45:02.120]  looks at them and they say why should we finance these guys when they're out there creating diseases
[45:02.120 --> 45:09.240]  they're they're creating fake terrorist places all over the world um you know they have 800
[45:09.240 --> 45:15.400]  military bases i mean they're they're a country gone berserk and they rely on us to pay for it
[45:15.400 --> 45:19.640]  and we say well no let's not pay for them let's ask them to trade themselves out that's what's
[45:19.640 --> 45:24.600]  been happening from seeing from outside of the united states the world is very very different
[45:25.560 --> 45:29.640]  you know the only problem with that is i and i totally agree with you that obviously the world
[45:29.640 --> 45:34.520]  no longer wants to finance that is is is that we now live in an age which is very different than
[45:34.520 --> 45:41.080]  50 years ago i mean armor our military power has really surpassed that of anything that has come
[45:41.080 --> 45:45.640]  before it and like you said we have private mercenary forces and we also have a lot of technology
[45:45.640 --> 45:51.400]  at our disposal that other countries do not obviously russia is a nuclear power and would
[45:51.400 --> 45:55.960]  give us a run for our money but you know i don't see much of europe being able to give us a run
[45:55.960 --> 46:00.760]  for money i'm not even sure that when it all comes down to it someone like china could give us a
[46:00.760 --> 46:05.000]  run for our money i mean i'm pretty scared at what these people will do when their back is
[46:05.560 --> 46:09.720]  right up against that wall and there is no more funding and there is that threat that they might
[46:09.720 --> 46:13.880]  actually have to go to an international tribunal uh you know will they just pull out all the stops
[46:13.880 --> 46:19.480]  with their military power well here's the you know the point is this is that unlike the case of the
[46:19.480 --> 46:24.600]  nazis nobody's going to be arrested for following orders and they're not facing death penalty
[46:24.600 --> 46:31.640]  anything they're just facing a loss of power and what these people you know their their secret
[46:31.640 --> 46:38.920]  flaw is this is that their organization this sort of luciferian group that is behind the neo-nazis
[46:39.560 --> 46:46.040]  who call themselves neocons is that they have a very very highly centralized system of authority
[46:46.040 --> 46:53.000]  so at the end of the day all you have to do is assassinate about five old men maybe 50
[46:53.000 --> 47:01.000]  to put an end to it so nobody's going to fight their hired mercenaries they're going to go straight
[47:01.000 --> 47:13.320]  for the eye we're talking papa buss bill clinton we're talking turtoff chinny blair uh the black
[47:13.320 --> 47:20.840]  pope in roam we're talking just a few people so you know at the end of the day you just got to
[47:20.840 --> 47:28.040]  take down those men and it's finished well i don't know i mean i always see power you know
[47:28.040 --> 47:33.640]  corrupting itself so say you take those guys out i mean this organization spans i mean if you just
[47:33.640 --> 47:40.680]  look at say the billerberg group that kind of that's 144 people now those 144 people meet for a weekend
[47:40.680 --> 47:47.000]  now a month or two later they go to bohemian grove at least a a large portion of them do and they
[47:47.000 --> 47:53.640]  disperse their agenda to 3 000 others you know and of course this is compartmentalized and you
[47:53.640 --> 47:59.800]  know nobody knows the entire plan but i i see those other 3000 people as clawing for power and
[47:59.800 --> 48:05.640]  after say the top 50 or top 100 are no longer with us uh you know they'll just gravitate
[48:05.640 --> 48:11.000]  towards that power as well i i'm not so sure that's the way that we'll be able to defeat this thing
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.960]  well you know that's an interesting point now i think that you have to understand and if we
[48:15.960 --> 48:23.880]  want to get back to the the chinese system like where ideally and i'm hoping this is how the chinese
[48:23.880 --> 48:29.160]  system will continue evolving but it'll evolve in this way it'll it'll be a little bit like you
[48:29.160 --> 48:36.440]  know one of these uh contest they have to find the best singer or whatever anybody can try for it
[48:37.560 --> 48:41.960]  and they can fight their way up to the top sort of like a sperm fight this way to get into the egg
[48:41.960 --> 48:47.720]  right there's 100 million sperm per ejaculation only one gets to get into the egg right but
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.800]  they're each given the same chance to get there if you have a situation where people can put out
[48:53.800 --> 48:58.120]  their ideas this is how i think we should run the planet this is how we should run the country
[48:58.120 --> 49:04.680]  and it's free and open and and it's chosen in that manner i think that is the future of democracy
[49:04.680 --> 49:09.720]  it'll be a system where sure there will be an elite of a few thousand at the top but it'll be a
[49:09.720 --> 49:14.280]  transparent everybody can see them and they can agree with them and follow them or else they can
[49:14.280 --> 49:20.760]  fight them and have a chance to take the takeover and kick them out of place uh that is the sort
[49:20.760 --> 49:24.600]  of system i'm hoping will replace the one where they do it in secret and you don't know what they're
[49:24.600 --> 49:29.880]  debating what they're thinking and that's the problem well obviously i want as much transparency
[49:29.880 --> 49:35.080]  as possible and i think that these uh you know meetings like the builder group are quite treasonous
[49:35.080 --> 49:40.200]  i mean they violate the logan act and everything else and you know but but those are the ones
[49:40.200 --> 49:44.760]  that we know about i mean we don't know about all the think tanks out there that sit in an
[49:44.760 --> 49:49.000]  nsa room and they're just like top-level generals and they sign off a piece of paper and they put
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.600]  out all these ideas and then those ideas say they come up with 20 of them it's some it's one guy
[49:54.600 --> 49:58.840]  that basically says you know i think that one's good you know i mean if you look at the northwoods
[49:58.840 --> 50:04.040]  proposal for instance i mean they had about 13 or 14 different proposals none of them were actually
[50:04.040 --> 50:08.840]  used uh for what they wanted you know kennedy was then killed less than a year later but
[50:08.840 --> 50:13.000]  they proposed a lot of things had they gone through with northwoods i highly doubt they
[50:13.000 --> 50:19.480]  would have done everything there so i mean i i i'm with you benjamin i want more transparency
[50:19.480 --> 50:23.800]  you know i i don't think that they should be able to hide behind the veil of not only secret
[50:23.800 --> 50:29.480]  societies but national security and classified documents uh but when they're how are we going
[50:29.480 --> 50:32.680]  to get there i mean a lot of people are going to propose that the only way we can get their
[50:32.680 --> 50:37.480]  benjamin and i'll get your take in the last segment after this is through one world government
[50:37.480 --> 50:42.440]  i mean and you know that's what i'm sitting here fighting i don't want to see one world
[50:42.440 --> 50:46.360]  government i don't want to see more power to the united nations or a global body like that i'm a

[54:49.400 --> 54:56.040]  and uh... it's not exactly clear how it will work out but my overall understanding is that we're
[54:56.040 --> 55:03.160]  going to come to an end of the secret government of the west ruling the planet now you talk about
[55:03.160 --> 55:09.240]  a world government and i'll be honest with you i'm actually in favor of a world government
[55:09.240 --> 55:16.200]  however i don't want a world government controlled in secret by a bunch of inbred european uh...
[55:16.200 --> 55:22.040]  and american families that you know manipulate the rest of humanity for their own personal
[55:22.600 --> 55:29.800]  ends but we do have some problems on this planet that can only be solved if we think of
[55:29.800 --> 55:35.160]  us as living on one planet and not as separate well what do you think those problems are
[55:35.160 --> 55:39.960]  well for example we've had something like 20 to 30 percent of all living species
[55:40.680 --> 55:46.520]  on this planet got extinct in the past century that's a problem you have these oceans that nobody
[55:46.520 --> 55:51.000]  has uh authority over being overfished and so we're seeing around the fishing oceans
[55:51.560 --> 55:58.840]  we have 50 million people dying a year of starvation so we need a very minimal structure
[55:58.840 --> 56:03.080]  so that for example countries where they have a problem with each other they don't go to war
[56:03.080 --> 56:07.560]  they sue each other there's an international court where you can sue if they think they're messing
[56:07.560 --> 56:13.480]  with you and you can trust that court and then you need an international organization to make
[56:13.480 --> 56:19.720]  take care of the environment and finally something to step in when people are dying in large numbers
[56:19.720 --> 56:25.240]  in order to stop them from dying very minimal architecture is needed well let me just take
[56:25.240 --> 56:30.280]  issue well let me just take issue with the environmental thing um you know first of all
[56:30.280 --> 56:33.960]  i'm not you know one of those guys that thinks we should pollute the environment all over and do
[56:33.960 --> 56:38.360]  whatever we want there should definitely be regulations but over the last 20 years i mean i
[56:38.360 --> 56:43.160]  can say in my personal life i was fear mongered as a child into you know global warming and all
[56:43.160 --> 56:47.320]  these horrors and by the time i was going to be 30 years old it was going to be 10 to 20 degrees
[56:47.320 --> 56:52.120]  hotter and maybe even worse than that and now they're talking about a carbon footprint and
[56:52.120 --> 56:56.840]  let's plant paying this carbon tax and limiting our water and saying you know if you have too much
[56:56.840 --> 57:01.960]  garbage or you have two cars you're going to be paying taxes on those i see that as a huge
[57:01.960 --> 57:06.920]  mode of control and i see a lot of people in this country people like christopher dodd and others
[57:06.920 --> 57:13.080]  proposing that as actual legislation and to me that's totally frightening and totally unnecessary
[57:13.080 --> 57:18.680]  okay well you you know the global warming thing is a great con job by the nuclear industry okay
[57:18.680 --> 57:25.000]  to create the image that nuclear technology is green and environmental friendly and they have
[57:25.000 --> 57:34.360]  hijacked the environmental movement for very sinister ends and i you know look the amount of
[57:34.360 --> 57:39.560]  carbon dioxide that humans have added so-called attitude environment since the beginning of
[57:39.560 --> 57:47.000]  industrialization is 100 ppm which is 110 thousandths of the atmosphere so anybody out there who
[57:47.000 --> 57:52.600]  wants to they can do this experiment take a thermometer go to a bar light a cigarette okay
[57:52.600 --> 57:57.240]  that's coq that's coming at the end of that cigarette and see if the bar gets hotter it won't
[57:57.240 --> 58:05.880]  okay so i i don't subscribe to that co2 nonsense okay and i i deeply regret the environmental
[58:05.880 --> 58:10.040]  movement has been hijacked by these nuclear in 90 percent of them are into that that's the problem
[58:10.600 --> 58:16.760]  yeah i what i'm talking about is a a third world farmer who has a choice his only choice is to
[58:16.760 --> 58:22.680]  burn down rainforest or watch his kids star and i'm saying let's give this guy a fertilizer and stuff
[58:22.680 --> 58:27.800]  so he doesn't have to burn down the rainforest and kill unknown species all right benjamin you

[1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:21.480]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:33.400]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and is the 22nd day of august 2008 a friday
[1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:40.280]  and uh one interview there boy uh fireworks blue you know i you know i'm just not a one
[1:00:40.280 --> 1:00:45.800]  world or i guess i i just you know i guess the uh road to hell is paved with good intentions and i
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:50.040]  just don't see how global government is going to work without being totally tyrannical and
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:55.080]  corrupt at some point it may start out nice who knows uh but it is not going to end up nice it's
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:01:00.760]  going to end up on a crazy technocratic society in my opinion i mean i'm sitting here and let me
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:04.120]  let me go through this little article because it's just totally ridiculous we were just talking
[1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:12.040]  about the car carbon footprint and we are totally being conditioned to live uh with less and pay more
[1:01:12.040 --> 1:01:18.280]  okay eco communities living the green life instead of cnn technology it's out of london england and
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:23.480]  they're going to tell you it's not so bad it's great and show you a couple pictures your houses are
[1:01:23.480 --> 1:01:30.600]  right on top of each other just like any little community little uh suburban area the term eco
[1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:36.120]  community might conjure up an image of bearded hippies tending and altamont before sharing a
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:41.640]  mung bean stew but as today's urbanese become more concerned about the reducting their carbon
[1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:47.320]  footprints remember they have to reduce that carbon footprint because we're all evil because we live
[1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:53.720]  we breathe we have cars god forbid some are finding that modern eco communities offer them a way to
[1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:59.640]  live substantially without foregoing their home comforts see it's not that bad join an eco community
[1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:04.680]  so they're going to mandate how you live how close your house has to be to another one there'll be no
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:11.720]  private property it just totally makes me sick that's just one example you know and as far as
[1:02:11.720 --> 1:02:15.800]  they're not being an election i'm sorry i really do believe there is going to be an election i believe
[1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:20.680]  they are going they're going for broke with obama all right and now they're putting out his short
[1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:27.720]  list of candidates he's got a short list now uh some of the people i recognized uh to be his vb vp
[1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:33.880]  were uh carbon footprint guy chris dodd you know he's proposed it uh people like westley clark
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:39.640]  who alex ranted about earlier this week not a good guy uh of course joe biden bill richardson
[1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:46.920]  who was in a lot of the uh democratic debates there at a new mexico uh sam non chuck hagel
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:51.560]  and we're all big buddies of chuck hagel chet edwards and that bane gentlemen they've been talking
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:57.560]  about i guess kathleen uh sobellis is another one too but we'll see actually is kathleen sobellis she
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:03:02.840]  has she's the kansas governor i'm pretty sure she's the builder bird chick oh you know he might shock
[1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:10.840]  the world and instead of uh evan bay or joseph biden or tim cane go with kathleen sobellis
[1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:15.080]  i wouldn't that would not shock me i could see that happening of course hillary is on the list i
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:21.080]  forgot to say of course hillary is on the list so for the next hour folks i'm going to be taking
[1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:26.040]  your calls and playing some clips uh maybe talking a little bit of seven but before i talk a little
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:30.920]  bit of seven uh we're going to play a clip out of terror storm in the next segment we're also
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:37.720]  going to play this clip uh with a cnn uh reporter has to criticize the tsa because he's on a terror
[1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:42.200]  watch list and then he goes through three other gentlemen who obviously should not be on a terror
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:47.640]  watch list and they're always going oh we're so inept oh we just can't do anything right but if
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:53.560]  you give us your blood we'll do it share it off we'll sit there and be like oh we just can't we
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:04:01.080]  can't really make sure unless we have some biometrics i mean it's so evil it's like well you already
[1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:05.960]  took the one step you're already going through the tsa you already have to have an identification
[1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:12.600]  but now you know we're going to train you to be on the uh the good time fly list you know the frequent
[1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:18.040]  fly are the not a threat passenger list and uh that'll be easy all you got to do is give us
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:24.760]  your fingerprints and maybe just a little bit of dna and a retina scan no big deal and if you want
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:29.160]  to just forego the whole process together all together and just go through a little whoop and
[1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:33.000]  drop off your butt luggage you now have to go through the whole thing and be screened maybe
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:38.200]  maybe you'll take this nice little chip will put in you so we'll be back with that cnn report and a

[1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:12.280]  hot showers than when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they
[1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:17.880]  evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin the kdf dual media shower filter works with both
[1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:23.320]  hot and cold water and it's designed to reduce chlorine lead mercury and iron and it inhibits

[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:34.360]  lasts 10 000 gallons or one year whichever comes first hospitals restaurants and water treatment
[1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:39.560]  facilities use this media to reduce chlorine iron heavy metals and bacteria what about you

[1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:28.840]  all right folks we are back it is the alex jones show i'm jason bermas you can get at
[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:34.440]  me at myspace.com slash jason bermas or you can add my film fable enemies myspace.com slash
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:38.520]  fable enemies of course we have a couple trailers out there we'll probably play one or two of those
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:44.920]  later in the show but i want to play this clip where a cnn reporter is on the terror watch list
[1:08:44.920 --> 1:08:49.320]  it's about four and a half minutes and uh not only is he on the terror watch list but so is a
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:54.600]  three-year-old child see they kind of make it funny but really listen because they want more
[1:08:54.600 --> 1:09:00.360]  and more and more and their excuse is always wear it out so let's go to that clip just crossing
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:04.440]  a half hour the next time you find yourself at the airport ticket counter you might be in for a
[1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:11.160]  surprise because you could be on the terror watch list the new aclu report says one million
[1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:17.960]  people are on it one of them drew griffin of cnn special investigations unit and as he tells us
[1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:23.240]  now well the threat posed by many of those on the list is imaginary the hassle that they go through
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:31.960]  is all too real washington attorney jim robinson is a former assistant attorney general he's a former
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:38.440]  us attorney from michigan he holds a high level government security clearance and he's a former
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:46.280]  law school dean a husband a granddad an american and he gets delayed if not stopped every time he
[1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:54.120]  gets on a plane why because robinson is also one of the estimated one million names now on the
[1:09:54.120 --> 1:10:01.640]  terror watch list so it seems for years now despite my best efforts to get off this week
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:07.160]  robinson joined the aclu in washington to mark what the group calls a ridiculous milestone
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:13.560]  a million names the government believes match known terrorists and according to the aclu
[1:10:14.120 --> 1:10:20.360]  20 000 new names like robinsons are added every month that means there must be
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:27.880]  about nine hundred and fifty to seventy five thousand people who don't belong on this list
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:34.680]  who are somehow caught in the mire of of doing this what does it mean it means because of his
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:40.280]  name he can't check into flights electronically he can't check bags at the curb can't check in at
[1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:47.000]  one of the new speedy airport kiosks every time he travels he and a million others need to wait
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:53.960]  in line and see somebody who then has to make a call and determine that apparently i am not
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:58.920]  the james kenneth robinson who is the cause of my being on the watch list
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:05.720]  don't think it can happen to you it's happening to me
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:16.040]  a watch list so how did i get on this list well the tsa is adamant it's not even me
[1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:21.640]  even though it is me getting stopped at the airports the tsa says it's the airlines full
[1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:27.640]  the airlines say they're just following the list provided to them by the tsa and coincidentally
[1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:33.320]  this all began in may shortly after i began a series of investigative reports critical of
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:43.160]  the tsa 11 flights now since may 19th on different airlines my name pops up forcing me to go to the
[1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:49.000]  counter show my identification sometimes the agent has to make a call before i get my ticket
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:55.480]  that's a hassle what does the tsa say nothing at least nothing on camera over the phone a public
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:12:01.320]  affairs worker told me again i'm not on the watch list and don't even think that someone in the tsa
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:09.320]  or anyone else is trying to get even right so if there's any thought or shadow of a thought that tsa
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:15.240]  somehow puts you on a watch list because of your reporting it is absolutely fabricated jim robinson
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:21.720]  who served two democratic president says he's trying not to think politics is involved either i don't
[1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:27.560]  feel safer because i have to go through this hassle i can tell you that the aclu's technology chief
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:32.680]  barry steinhardt says the list is so secretive and yet so shoddily put together it's hard to tell
[1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:38.840]  how it's being used or abused truth is we really don't know how much is bureaucratic ineptness
[1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:44.360]  and how much is you know and how much is bureaucratic how much is political retaliation even more
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:49.480]  frustrating than being on it is trying to get off according to the tsa you fill out a form online
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:54.840]  which i did on may 28th you then copy personal documents fill out another form and send them
[1:12:54.840 --> 1:13:00.920]  to homeland security which i also did on may 28th and then apparently you wait robinson has been
[1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:09.080]  waiting now three years on may 2nd 2005 i filled out all their forms made a copy of my passport
[1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:16.520]  my driver's license my voter's registration card put it in the package and send it off to tsa
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:20.760]  all right cut the clip never heard that so there you go he he did everything they asked him see
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:25.080]  this is a clip before the sheriff's off one where they followed up and the guy is still on the tsa's
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:30.920]  uh watch list so is drew griffin on top of that uh two other people the name james robinson
[1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:35.320]  including a five-year-old boy are also on that watch list but everything's going to be okay
[1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:41.000]  once you give up your blood your biometric thumbprint and your eye i scan then they'll be able to now
[1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:45.720]  yeah right all right so i promised collars we're going to take them let's go to the one in germany
[1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:52.040]  let's go to maria in germany that's a far far far away maria with us hello how are you doing yeah
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:58.120]  fine yeah yeah you know this biometrics the um i'm the hitler even i mean they checked in t-bed
[1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:04.120]  they uh checked humans for all the facial characters and then they were beaten the avian race
[1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:11.080]  which is i think the clowns the whole thing you know bush and and and a lot and the um
[1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:18.840]  the um english queen i think it mainly comes from the english queen which has spread her own
[1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:23.080]  following you know there's people are used to living in england i also lived in america you
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:29.080]  know there's people that are definitely different so you're saying that they're they they're using
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:32.760]  biometrics i mean that's the plan thank you for the call i mean obviously they want to expand
[1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:39.560]  biometrics to everywhere over in london uh i think it's something like 300 plus cameras a day
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:46.120]  that uh photograph and tape you uh downtown it's probably more than i think that was like a 2006
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:51.000]  number and you're seeing that expansion now in the states uh you know alex had the uh
[1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:56.600]  what was it the austin sheriff in here asa veda and he was talking about you know uh
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:01.320]  plate scanning cameras let's put them in you know we're just going to get speeders with them yeah
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:05.880]  right come on they're they're going to take a database you can still watch on the discovery
[1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:09.960]  channel all the things that happen in europe how they use the facial recognition over there so that
[1:15:09.960 --> 1:15:15.960]  it's done quite a lot it's expanding and i see it coming into the airports rather quickly i mean
[1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:23.880]  we already have these basically you're shown naked i mean it's an x-ray but it's not an x-ray
[1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:28.200]  that sees your bones it's an x-ray that goes around your the entire contour of your body
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:32.600]  whatever clothes you're wearing whatever whatever devices are on you at the time all right let's
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:40.840]  jump to jd in texas what's up jd yeah jason uh it's uh benjamin still with you uh no he he
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:47.800]  dropped after the hour what were your thoughts on that interview well uh when when i heard him
[1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:59.880]  speaking all i could think about was uh senator um trader mccain and why is that well uh i just
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:06.760]  wanted to tell him if i decided to betray my country i could live very comfortable in china also
[1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:15.400]  just like mccain did when he when he was in north vietnam he lived like a king compared to the other
[1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:27.240]  prisoners out there and it's very obvious that benjamin um um uh is not a christian and because
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:35.240]  he has no compassion for the thousands of of and millions of christians that was murdered and
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:41.560]  persecuted in china well i don't know i mean i guess that he has this whole you know perspective
[1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:46.120]  china living there for so long is kind of endeared by the beauty of the country but i'm sorry i just
[1:16:46.120 --> 1:16:51.480]  can't get down with their government although it's been more westernized again the police are the
[1:16:51.480 --> 1:16:57.320]  military there that is not good yes they were i mean he's contesting whether or not they still
[1:16:57.320 --> 1:17:01.640]  are harvesting organs you know i'm gonna have to look into it before i make any kind of decision
[1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:07.560]  but any state that would harvest the organs of prisoners and dissidents uh you know to sell on
[1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:12.360]  the black market can't be a good one one child policies i mean these things sound crazy to me
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:19.480]  well that's reason i say uh evidently benjamin is not a christian all right or he'd be he'd be
[1:17:19.480 --> 1:17:26.440]  uh he'd be bringing these things up and he wouldn't be living in china all right jd i thank you for
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:33.480]  the call let's jump to elliott in ohio elliott are you with us yeah jason i doing good man what's
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:41.880]  poppin well i remember actually um watching uh one benjamin's uh little uh lectures or just
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:47.240]  just you know just a video he posted online and maybe on his website and he uh he was explaining
[1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:53.800]  how um he's uh researched and been a part of or at least been able to participate and get first
[1:17:53.800 --> 1:18:02.280]  hand like observations of secret societies of uh the east and um in china apparently he was saying
[1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:11.240]  that the chinese and the eastern secret societies are now uh vying for power really with the west
[1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:16.280]  with the rock fellers with the rock child because the rock child the rock fellers and all the secret
[1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:23.560]  sides that boil down from them are now trying to in a sense engulf and take over and achieve more
[1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:30.040]  power than secret sides in the east so what he said when he's like uh will pay you like double
[1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:35.800]  you know for the mercenaries yeah it may be good i mean just you know for a quick fix to get us
[1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:41.080]  out of you know martial law and again you have to be careful because if they are vying for
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:47.000]  such a power if they still want one world government and you have mercenaries now working
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:52.920]  for china now you got chinese mercenaries in the u.s government so well that's the point
[1:18:52.920 --> 1:18:57.880]  i was trying to make to him that this is all about globalization anyway and uh you know
[1:18:57.880 --> 1:19:03.320]  this is this is in essence about a one world order and he goes and tells me that he's in favor
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:08.040]  of that i think that's a very dangerous proposition i don't think people understand how evil people
[1:19:08.040 --> 1:19:15.080]  can be especially people at the top continue yeah definitely i mean like it's just you know what
[1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:21.560]  i will agree with him on this it would be nice to have some help if uh martial law ever came in
[1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:27.400]  to play and civil unrest to form it would be nice to have some assistance from black ops you know
[1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:33.720]  ex-military like people versus us just being you know uh militia we have military men in there
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:39.880]  but then again right afterward you got to crack down you got to make sure you are prepared to
[1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:46.360]  fight against them because i don't trust mercenaries mercenaries now they will turn on you in a second
[1:19:46.360 --> 1:19:51.080]  i thank you for the call we'll be back after this info wars dot com prisonplanet.com i'm jason

[1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:13.080]  man i'm telling you especially if you have like a home theater or something you really
[1:27:13.080 --> 1:27:15.080]  get into the film
[1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:18.840]  well thanks man i mean you know those movies are really good and i'm a huge
[1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:21.560]  fan of truth rising i didn't have a lot to do with it other than getting some
[1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:23.400]  footage and just being down here
[1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:26.600]  while they were editing it i got to do the cover art or whatever
[1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:27.560]  um... but
[1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:31.240]  i mean it's it's just an excellent way to bring other people and i mean
[1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:33.240]  some people aren't going to be
[1:27:33.240 --> 1:27:37.240]  as receptive to it as you know to a road to tyranny but when they see hey wow this
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:42.360]  has rosio donnell and martin sheen and george carlin and they're all expressing
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:44.440]  these views i've never heard before
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:47.480]  and it's just added together really well and you have family members and it's
[1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:48.840]  just an awesome movie
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:50.840]  and you know loose change final cut
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:55.080]  i mean it it's the end all be all on the physical anomalies and other things on
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:58.760]  the world trade center i mean we we take the official story apart
[1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:02.280]  in a way that had never been done before even with the second edition
[1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:06.120]  we didn't have as many interviews we didn't have as many documents we didn't
[1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:08.760]  have you know as much from the nine eleven commission
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:13.000]  and now fabled enemies really goes into the international spiring folks it
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:17.640]  really goes into the israeli operatives of the saudi arabian funding the funding
[1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:21.080]  from within this country of the continuity of government program
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:25.160]  that was in place in drills on the morning of nine eleven and then put into

[1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:17.560]  to the sides on on the things begin to cave in internally
[1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:21.400]  and they basically say that the bottom middle of the building is what went
[1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:26.920]  first but there's no physics applied to the actual models it is simply an
[1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:30.600]  animation put together i thank you for the call eric we're gonna get deep into
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:33.240]  building seven later was shane geiger

[1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:09.760]  our sponsors this show is just not possible and
[1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:13.440]  especially efoodsdirect.com
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:17.520]  efoods is a storeable food company they have the best storeable food at the best
[1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:20.960]  price and on top of that who knows folks
[1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:23.920]  i mean let's hope full for it's completely wrong and
[1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:27.680]  we don't have a total economic collapse and let's hope all these other
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:31.920]  doom and gloom people are completely wrong but we just don't know i mean
[1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:35.360]  out in new york again they're they're putting a
[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:38.640]  a cap on the amount of grain and rice you can buy at bj's i mean that's
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:41.200]  craziness i never thought i was going to live in a country where they were
[1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:44.480]  actually going to be putting food caps on and of course we know that
[1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:48.080]  food prices are just shot through the roofs along with oil so there's no
[1:34:48.080 --> 1:34:51.600]  reason that you shouldn't give the good people at efoodsdirect.com
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:59.760]  they call it 1-800-409-5633 that is 1-800-409-5633

[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:06.400]  of course world trade center seven nist is a hot topic

[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:13.280]  about a half hour after that of course bob Chapman will be
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:18.000]  popping in for his uh economic forecast for the next
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:22.080]  few weeks the international forecaster dot com and then i it is my pleasure
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:25.920]  to have richard gay john in the last half hour again
[1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:29.920]  to discuss world trade center building seven and the nist report
[1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:34.160]  all right let's go to guy in florida guy are you with us
[1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:37.520]  yes sir how are you today good man what's on your mind
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:42.480]  hey man i just wanted uh first thank you for uh we've changed i mean that is one
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:46.160]  of the greatest videos ever made you know well thank you brother
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:49.920]  but um i also just wanted to mention uh
[1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:53.600]  how's it on the show uh maybe two days ago
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:57.760]  you was bringing up the imf talking about uh an economic depression is
[1:35:57.760 --> 1:36:00.720]  definitely imminent can you ask me to plumber
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:04.080]  i mean it's a definite possibility i mean when you borrow
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:08.720]  all of this money and you continue to get into these international conflicts
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:11.760]  i mean let's let's just break down the georgia situation right there
[1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:16.000]  uh in order for that to happen we first like uh paul craig robert said we had to
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  surround russia all right so we've been doing that over the past few years
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:23.520]  with our nato allies you know nato is supposed to be this peacekeeping force
[1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:27.920]  know their puppets of this globalist structure so on top of that we bring in
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:31.360]  all this radar equipment then we bring in us special forces
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:34.880]  you know i mean we're we're thinning out on how much we're actually going to be
[1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:38.400]  able to afford in these military conflicts i mean you look at your asian
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:42.080]  we're trying to provoke an attack with iran uh on top of that the housing
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:46.240]  market here is no good we're building a trans texas corridor so yeah i could
[1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:49.200]  see them pulling the plug i think they want to do it
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:53.280]  in a in a elongated period of time i don't think that they want to have a
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:57.840]  1929 style crash i highly doubt that on september 30th the
[1:36:57.840 --> 1:37:01.120]  world is going to change and we're just going to have no money in this country
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:06.400]  but i think that we will see a gradual slide down this road you know i think
[1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:09.840]  alex is correcting his analysis that they'll throw us a few bones here and
[1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:14.160]  there uh by you know cheapening gas at the pump
[1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:18.240]  only to raise it again next summer and for us to fall deeper into decline so
[1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:22.160]  yeah man i mean i i pray to god that we're not going to just hit that
[1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:26.320]  1929 style depression but i do think within the next four or five
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:30.960]  years we're going to be taken down to second world status if i don't think
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:34.800]  third world status because i think that uh mexico is going to be brought up and
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:38.080]  obviously that'll be the merger for us mexico and canada
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:41.680]  and possibly a parody on currency i mean for those that don't know
[1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:46.240]  our dollar is now worth less than the canadian dollar after years of dominance
[1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:50.480]  and the peso is creeping up uh so you know i hope i uh answered your question
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:55.280]  guy got anything else in your mind uh no bro thanks you got it you got it man
[1:37:55.280 --> 1:38:00.880]  all right let's jump to andrew in oklahoma andrew you with us
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:07.600]  hey jason how's it going good man um yeah i uh i think you're uh your segment
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:11.440]  there with the cnn reporter drew griffin
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:15.200]  and uh that's in fact my name andrew griffin uh
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:18.320]  our radio free oklahoma up here in oklahoma city
[1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:22.240]  and uh i went to the airport here uh within the past month
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:25.520]  and when i got to the counter i was flying to michigan
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:29.520]  and uh there were some eyebrows raised when my name came up
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:33.760]  and i was just wondering if that has anything to do with mr griffin's
[1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:37.680]  you know investigation of the tsa and then my name popping up and then they're
[1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:40.800]  having to cross-reference my it could be or you and you got a
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:44.240]  patriot radio show it could be just that i mean i don't get flagged at the
[1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:47.840]  airport but then again similar names do and then you know in the follow-up
[1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:51.840]  segment they talk about how well if i want to get around it
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:56.880]  i sign in as d griffin or uh you know i put in my middle name and sometimes i
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:00.800]  don't get flagged but other times i do so you know it's it's very possible in the
[1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:03.840]  in the follow-up to this story too there were three james robinson's
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:08.320]  one of which was a five-year-old boy i mean can you imagine and the woman
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:12.240]  actually the mother actually says you know i've i have found a way to get
[1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:15.200]  around it rather quickly and they're like well what's that well i just tip
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:18.000]  the guy i just give him a 20 and then they just
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:21.120]  move on i mean not that it isn't ludicrous enough for them just to move on
[1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:23.840]  because he's a child but then you have to tip them i mean it's
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:27.840]  disgusting no it is and ironically one of our
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:31.920]  fellow patriots here in oklahoma with told the truth
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:35.920]  jim robinson is his name and uh you know i was just wondering if i had any
[1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:39.440]  connection to it either because you know we're we're pretty outspoken in the
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:43.840]  patriot community here in the sooner state and so these things are
[1:39:43.840 --> 1:39:47.280]  disconcerting to say the least well when you have a million people on that list
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:52.000]  there's no way that all of them are quote unquote terrorists or even al-qaeda or
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:55.760]  extremists you know they're average people and they're probably people that
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:39:58.400]  are threats to the system i i thank you for the call man
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:02.960]  i mean god knows who's on that list i mean i i would be foolish to think
[1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:06.880]  if my name wasn't on a list or alex's name wasn't on a list
[1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:10.240]  but again i don't like to live in fear and paranoia
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:14.240]  and i think that they they put a lot of people on that list that they know
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:19.680]  aren't are not only not dissidents but have no way into terror just because
[1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:23.600]  they make it that inconvenience and they say oh well in order to fix the system
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:25.840]  everybody's just going to have to give their blood
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:30.720]  or their thumbprint or their eye scan uh you know for this new surveillance
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:33.120]  society they're basically acclimating us to it
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:37.760]  all right let's jump to mike in north carolina mike are you with us
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:43.120]  yes i'm right here um want to comment on that you and alice are doing a great
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:47.280]  fantastic job i've been involved in this for about two and a half years
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:50.560]  and the one thing that really really did it for me wasn't
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:55.440]  either one of the trade towers but it was world trade tower number seven
[1:40:55.440 --> 1:41:01.520]  number seven did it for me um i accept that the planes were used at diversions
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:04.720]  for the implosion of both of the other trades at towers
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:08.720]  now the one plane that was shot down in pennsylvania
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:12.000]  i kind of think i haven't really dug in deep yet
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.440]  i think it was supposed to hit world trade numbers all right let me let me
[1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:18.960]  answer that for you a lot of people speculate that that other plane was on
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:23.280]  its way to seven well in fabled enemies i show you that there was not just
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:26.160]  you know the world trade center in pentagonist targets but there were up
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:31.920]  to 11 targets that day they got a list uh at the maryland police department
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:34.800]  that morning before any attacks that occurred the world trade center the
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:38.080]  pentagon sears tower were on it the baltimore world trade center and of
[1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:41.120]  course some of those actually came through we know that because paris
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:45.520]  glendoning the governor got on fox news and talked about it in the film on top
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:49.600]  of that they had hijackings coming out of alaska coming out of canada
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:52.640]  all over the place they thought that there was a bomb on board
[1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:56.880]  delta 1989 uh there was a serious threat against
[1:41:56.880 --> 1:42:00.480]  air force one that morning against the white house and in fact
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:05.440]  in early reports they let it go that the quote unquote hijackers or terrorists
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:08.560]  or whoever committed this were actually decoding
[1:42:08.560 --> 1:42:13.280]  all of the top code words for the white house the pentagon the cia the fd i
[1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:18.160]  that morning so i would say this could world trade center seven have been a
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:21.840]  target it's a possibility is it a probability to me
[1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:25.600]  i don't think so because it's kind of low on that skyline it would have been a
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:30.320]  very tough hit even with let's say a remote aircraft now am i saying that's
[1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:34.160]  not a possibility no i think they they thought they were going to get away with
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:37.760]  it because again this was a huge spookhouse we're talking
[1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:40.720]  the largest cia base outside of langley virginia
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:44.080]  the largest secret service office in the world
[1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:47.040]  and i i think that they thought that they were just going to be able to bring it
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:49.440]  down that there would be enough damage enough smoke
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:52.720]  that they could blow it up i mean there is the possibility
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:56.000]  of that plane hitting the building but i i think it's a low on
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:01.280]  go ahead um the doctor shiam sundar i watched it yesterday
[1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:04.880]  um for world trade center number seven report
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:10.160]  and his report about conclusion about the office furniture
[1:43:10.160 --> 1:43:13.920]  burning in the buildings in that building which calls
[1:43:13.920 --> 1:43:18.800]  thermal reaction on the ground on i think it was number seventy eight of the
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:22.240]  of the court thermal expansion yeah bought that
[1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:24.800]  the tumbling down the world trade center number seven
[1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:29.200]  i think that is the lowest low as anybody
[1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:32.880]  can go on that conclusion oh it's terrible but i'll say this
[1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:36.320]  he's the same guy that went to popular mechanics said they had photographs and
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:39.440]  video that no one else did said that a quarter of the building was scooped out
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:42.480]  i have the quote again in fabled enemies where he said
[1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:46.320]  about 25 percent of the building or 10 stories was scooped out
[1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:50.080]  of world trade center seven well we bring you inside world trade center seven
[1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:52.800]  we show you the south face of world trade center seven
[1:43:52.800 --> 1:43:55.840]  didn't happen they had to retract it they even had to say
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:43:59.520]  that the damage caused by the uh collapse of world trade centers one and
[1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:03.280]  two had little to no effect on why the building actually went down and if you
[1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:08.560]  honestly believe that thermal expansion of the interior columns for one column
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:12.800]  on the 13th floor to detach caused a symmetrical
[1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:17.120]  vertical collapse in under seven seconds well i have about five or six
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:20.000]  bridges that i'd love to sell you after the show
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.320]  thank you so much for the call mike i'm glad that
[1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:25.280]  building seven woke you up it's what i carry around on my phone
[1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:28.960]  when i go to tell people about nine eleven will be on my phone this year
[1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:32.880]  at ground zero remember i think it's a what is it 2008 now or never dot com
[1:44:32.880 --> 1:44:36.320]  uh you go to that event fabled enemies truth rising both going to be playing
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:38.960]  on september 10th alex and i will be speaking
[1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:42.080]  and then there are events obviously on the 11th and after
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:45.600]  so uh support the first responders come down to new york and help us out
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:51.040]  let's jump to adam in ohio adam are you with us
[1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:55.040]  you there adam oh yes sir what's up jason good to talk to you man
[1:44:55.040 --> 1:44:59.040]  just uh ordered fabled enemies this morning really appreciate
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:03.520]  all the work that you do thank you man um got a couple things i wanted to
[1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:06.640]  mention to you i thought you might be interested in one on the
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:11.280]  notion of like militarized police you've ever heard of a company called global
[1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:16.000]  asset tax group i have a chance you should check them out sometime just
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:21.360]  global asset tax group tac dot com like a security firm
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:24.720]  and it says on their website that they draw their expertise
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:29.360]  from current and former special operations personnel from the u.s israel
[1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:33.360]  and other nations and it says that they have a five-day
[1:45:33.360 --> 1:45:38.240]  uh law enforcement you know american law enforcement training program in israel
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:41.760]  so i thought that was pretty interesting for people who doubt
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:44.960]  no that israel is a part of this i mean come on not only that
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:48.400]  i mean first of all you know israel is an intricate part because
[1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:52.480]  they are in eurasia they are our centerpiece in the middle east right
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:56.240]  now i mean now that we do have afghanistan iraq obviously
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:45:59.440]  you know we have a little bit of an expansion there but things like black
[1:45:59.440 --> 1:46:03.680]  water are now opening up quote-unquote cia type wings they're not just
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:07.040]  mercenaries anymore they're they're opening their own private
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:10.400]  intelligence services and that this sounds like to me
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:13.600]  yeah well i just thought it's a good way for people who doubted you can just show
[1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:17.520]  them to the website and tell them no our police are being trained by special
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:21.200]  ops people even from foreign countries on foreign soil
[1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:24.160]  so you know what well we had asked veda in here
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:27.280]  uh... you know the austin uh... sheriff's department that the head of the
[1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:30.240]  sheriff's department admitting that they have these kind of programs where they
[1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:33.920]  bring in israeli officers and all this other stuff i mean it's in the mainstream
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:37.440]  news but people just don't want to own up to it they
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:40.000]  don't want to see it as negative they're like oh
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:43.200]  well they're just sharing information and tactics that's a good thing
[1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:47.680]  no they're getting ready to globalize they're getting ready to join forces
[1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:52.640]  against we the people totally what is it it's just a concrete example for people
[1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:55.280]  who disagree and just don't go and read it from the horse's mouth
[1:46:55.280 --> 1:46:59.920]  all right well i'll go ahead good um you remember that big cyclone
[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:03.120]  that hit uh... me and marlowe a while ago did you know that there was a
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:06.800]  military exercise going on in thailand right then
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:10.800]  at the same time it wouldn't it wouldn't shock me i'm not one of the guys to get
[1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:14.560]  into all the harp stuff and you know whether the tsunami was engineered
[1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:19.120]  years ago or even katrina i do look at the evidence it is compelling
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:23.680]  obviously alex has had uh... the father of uh...
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:27.760]  uh... what is it uh... weather warfare on the show i forget what his name is ben
[1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:31.120]  livingston is his name and uh... you know literally back in the seventies they
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:35.520]  were creating these storms in vietnam so the technology's been around for a
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:40.080]  while harp is very advanced there's a lot of stuff that's shrouded in mystery
[1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:43.760]  but i wish that people would crack that mystery i thank you for the call adam
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:47.520]  uh... let's jump to the next caller let's go to mike in illinois
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:50.520]  mike you with us
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:51.920]  yeah yes sir

[1:47:52.560 --> 1:47:56.320]  uh... actually i have a few things on a touch base first of all how dare these
[1:47:56.320 --> 1:48:02.000]  guys bring up after seven years world uh... the building seven i mean come on
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.640]  i mean who do they think these people we are i mean
[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:08.480]  i i know we're dumbed down but uh... and i'm gonna play you a clip

[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:14.160]  both blitzer tells you mystery solved
[1:48:14.160 --> 1:48:15.760]  it's over it's over it
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:19.520]  if you know what uh... there is somebody earlier that said well we need a
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:21.840]  militarized civilian
[1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:23.040]  i guess group
[1:48:23.040 --> 1:48:27.840]  i call you know not to get into specifics but i'm ex-military myself and i
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:32.160]  have plenty of people who are just ready
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:33.040]  um...
[1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:37.040]  for a peaceful rose revolution so to speak but um...
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:41.040]  you know if if these guys want to push well i'm i'm telling you we can push a
[1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:43.360]  heck a lot harder and uh...
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:47.600]  and i'm i'm just very thankful for you guys i'm thankful for a lot of people
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:51.760]  who have all helped open up my eyes along with i i swear every day i'm
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:55.040]  i'm probably talking at least one person a day and wake them up
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:59.360]  and i work a lot with we are change chicago we do a lot of broadcasting and
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:03.440]  and that shows personal shows with public access and so forth
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:04.560]  and uh...
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:06.560]  i just want to thank you guys as well but
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:10.160]  man these guys are pushing hard and we need to push back
[1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:13.840]  so they're just doing this because again right now we're in the last week of
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:14.880]  august okay
[1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:17.680]  uh... september eleventh is now less than a month away
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:21.280]  it has been kept out of the news ad nauseam september eleventh was not
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:22.240]  mentioned
[1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:26.240]  barely at all this year i remember the fifth anniversary just like i predicted
[1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:29.920]  was going to get a lot of media coverage so will the tenth anniversary
[1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:30.640]  but
[1:49:30.640 --> 1:49:33.120]  they want to put this information out there
[1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:35.040]  kind of under the radar
[1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:38.240]  not really have you think about it you'll see a couple stories about the
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:40.960]  anniversary of september eleventh maybe the week of
[1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:43.920]  but they're not going to give us our our podium they're going to try to keep it
[1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:46.240]  out of the public's eye that there is this big
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:49.200]  dissent in this country that we do know
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:51.920]  the government's version of what happened on nine eleven is a total bust
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:54.800]  it's a total lie for instance this new york times article
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:56.720]  that uh... features richard gauging it
[1:49:56.720 --> 1:49:59.200]  it tries to distort the issue by saying that
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:01.920]  uh... first of all explosives were planted in the pentagon that's not a
[1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:03.120]  popular theory i
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:06.800]  i don't agree with that theory on top of that they say that only one in seven
[1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:08.160]  americans thinks that
[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:12.120]  uh... world trade center seven was a control demolition i have never heard
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:13.400]  one in seven
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:16.000]  now there's sixteen percent were pulled
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:19.720]  thinking that world trade center one in two were controlled demolition break
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:22.160]  we have eighty four percent who don't believe
[1:50:22.160 --> 1:50:24.600]  uh... the official version of nine eleven we have
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:26.200]  thirty six percent
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:29.760]  that uh... believe basically believe that the government only let it out
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:33.200]  happen on purpose but help it along this one in seven
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:36.080]  is just a total distraction man and it kind of makes me sick
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:38.680]  micah thank you for the call we're going to be taking colors
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:41.680]  in the next segment and then at one o'clock the top of the hour to have

[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:07.880]  stronghold
[1:51:07.880 --> 1:51:10.680]  yeah the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers from the new

[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:09.160]  hundreds of my fellow troops i went to grounds here and we knew what to do
[1:52:09.160 --> 1:52:10.400]  or at least we thought we did
[1:52:10.400 --> 1:52:13.240]  truth rising is a breakthrough nine eleven film
[1:52:13.240 --> 1:52:15.880]  that finally gives first responders a platform

[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:26.320]  was safe to breathe
[1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:30.120]  this film follows the growing momentum of nine eleven truth as brave souls

[1:53:52.220 --> 1:53:59.220]  Don't forget to ask about our Mid-State Fair Special, that's GetTheT.com.
[1:54:32.220 --> 1:54:37.220]  Alright folks, final segment of the second hour. Man, we just shoot through this show.
[1:54:37.220 --> 1:54:43.220]  I am Jason Bermas. I'm subbing in for Alex Jones. I'm going to be with you on the Sunday show all the way through Thursday
[1:54:43.220 --> 1:54:48.220]  while Alex reports live from the DNC, the Democratic National Convention.
[1:54:48.220 --> 1:54:54.220]  Man, talk about a busy guy. Not only is Alex going there, but he's going to New York for the September 11th events.
[1:54:54.220 --> 1:55:05.220]  He's going to be speaking with myself while we preview, not preview, but show Fabled Enemies and Truth Rising the Night Before 9-11-08,
[1:55:05.220 --> 1:55:10.220]  the 7th anniversary. And again, the media is being real quiet about this anniversary.
[1:55:10.220 --> 1:55:17.220]  They're also really quiet about how Thomas Keane travels the country now.
[1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:21.220]  Telling teachers and faculty how they're supposed to teach 9-11.
[1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:26.220]  Because it is becoming more of a historic event that children are going to have to learn about.
[1:55:26.220 --> 1:55:30.220]  And God forbid they don't, you know, believe the official story.
[1:55:30.220 --> 1:55:34.220]  That's funny to me because my movie has been shown in so many high schools and colleges.
[1:55:34.220 --> 1:55:38.220]  You know, a lot of my friends are teachers and have shown it to their students.
[1:55:38.220 --> 1:55:42.220]  So, you know, I think it's going to be hard for them to put a cap on that.
[1:55:42.220 --> 1:55:53.220]  I think that a lot of schools are going to ban my films, which is sad because, you know, our films are so far the best attempt of truth that I've seen.
[1:55:53.220 --> 1:55:58.220]  Alright, let's jump to another caller. Let's go to Richard in Texas. Richard, are you with us?
[1:55:58.220 --> 1:56:05.220]  Hi, Jason. Just a couple of quick comments regarding weather and harp and that sort of thing.
[1:56:05.220 --> 1:56:08.220]  I think it's been very interesting what's been going on with that tropical storm.
[1:56:08.220 --> 1:56:16.220]  It actually formed an eye after it made landfall the first time, which is bizarre and the way it's moved and all that sort of thing.
[1:56:16.220 --> 1:56:23.220]  And one other comment just quickly is with regard to all these players on the world scene right now,
[1:56:23.220 --> 1:56:28.220]  it's just hard to know how deep the rabbit hole goes, but whether it's Russia or Chavez,
[1:56:28.220 --> 1:56:34.220]  virtually us or all the players with the exception of maybe directly Israel and the UK right now,
[1:56:34.220 --> 1:56:38.220]  this oil price thing has funded all of these guys.
[1:56:38.220 --> 1:56:47.220]  And, you know, the amount of money that's floating around in that and the ultimate impact on geopolitical issues is just hard to even figure how to get to the bottom of it.
[1:56:47.220 --> 1:56:56.220]  But now on to WTC7. I called Michael Newman this morning at NIST, got him on the line and told him that I used to be in the insurance business
[1:56:56.220 --> 1:57:04.220]  insuring commercial buildings, which I did, and, you know, we must be in a whole new world now and the insurance market should go berserk
[1:57:04.220 --> 1:57:12.220]  that this could happen and raise rates on these properties as a result of the ability of buildings to collapse in this fashion.
[1:57:12.220 --> 1:57:15.220]  And I said, you know, we're in a whole new world, aren't we?
[1:57:15.220 --> 1:57:22.220]  And he says, well, it was just, you know, an unusually constructed building with long spans in these beams and that sort of thing.
[1:57:22.220 --> 1:57:27.220]  And I said, that makes no logical sense. And I said, what about the molten steel at the bottom?
[1:57:27.220 --> 1:57:33.220]  Oh, first of all, he said, you guys in speaking to me, and I said, look, I'm just a concerned American.
[1:57:33.220 --> 1:57:36.220]  I'm not a you guy. Don't group me into anything.
[1:57:36.220 --> 1:57:42.220]  But in any case, when I mentioned the molten steel thing, he says, look, I don't have time for this and hung up on me,
[1:57:42.220 --> 1:57:44.220]  which was just an interesting experience.
[1:57:44.220 --> 1:57:52.220]  Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, they don't want to address the real issues. Again, their computer model, they didn't apply any physics to that.
[1:57:52.220 --> 1:58:00.220]  And they can, by the way, that's how these computer models work, is that they can apply, you know, physics and physical properties to things you design in 3D.
[1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:02.220]  This is how it's done. This is how engineering works now.
[1:58:02.220 --> 1:58:07.220]  They often build these computer models to see what's going to happen before it actually does.
[1:58:07.220 --> 1:58:13.220]  And they did nothing of the sort. They built these 3D wireframe models and animated a collapse.
[1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:16.220]  Richard, I thank you so much for the call.
[1:58:16.220 --> 1:58:19.220]  We're going to have Jonathan Elanoff on the other side.
[1:58:19.220 --> 1:58:24.220]  Don't worry, we're going to be taking your calls all day long, especially through Elanoff and Geiger.
[1:58:24.220 --> 1:58:29.220]  So call in. It's infowars.com and prismplanet.com. Get fabled enemies today.
[1:58:29.220 --> 1:58:33.220]  It ships out September 1st. Prismplanet.tv August 31st.
[1:58:33.220 --> 1:58:38.220]  Music
[1:58:41.220 --> 1:58:44.220]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:46.220 --> 1:58:49.220]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.220 --> 1:58:58.220]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:58.220 --> 1:59:02.220]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:59:02.220 --> 1:59:04.220]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:59:04.220 --> 1:59:07.220]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:59:07.220 --> 1:59:14.220]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:14.220 --> 1:59:21.220]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:59:21.220 --> 1:59:25.220]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:25.220 --> 1:59:30.220]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:59:30.220 --> 1:59:35.220]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:59:35.220 --> 1:59:44.220]  Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prismplanet.tv.
[1:59:44.220 --> 1:59:48.220]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[1:59:48.220 --> 1:59:59.220]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.220 --> 2:00:13.220]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.220 --> 2:00:22.220]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.220 --> 2:00:29.220]  Alright, folks, we are back. It's the Alex Jones Show. I'm Jason Bermas, sitting in.
[2:00:29.220 --> 2:00:37.220]  We're topping off the third hour of four hours of unadulterated, true radio, real radio.
[2:00:37.220 --> 2:00:47.220]  We're not going to be talking about Britney Spears on the MTV Music Awards. We're not going to be talking about, you know, Christina Applegate getting cancer at 36.
[2:00:47.220 --> 2:00:52.220]  Although that is a story in itself. Not so much that she has. It is that cancer is exploding in the younger people.
[2:00:52.220 --> 2:00:57.220]  Gee, I wonder why? Could it be the cancer viruses they've injected us with in these vaccinations?
[2:00:57.220 --> 2:01:03.220]  Gee, I don't know. Could it be the poison they're feeding us again and again? Could it be all the fluoride in the water?
[2:01:03.220 --> 2:01:10.220]  Well, more than likely, folks. But dropping that subject, and again, we're going to be taking your calls throughout this interview.
[2:01:10.220 --> 2:01:18.220]  But we've got Jonathan Ellenoff of We Are Changed Colorado with us. He's just done so much to set up this Democratic National Convention.
[2:01:18.220 --> 2:01:28.220]  He was on the radio earlier today with Alex on the Peter Boyle's program against Recreate 68, a provocateur group in which Jonathan almost single-handedly exposed.
[2:01:28.220 --> 2:01:34.220]  He's also a good friend of mine, and he really knows how to put on an event. Jonathan Ellenoff, how are you, sir?
[2:01:34.220 --> 2:01:36.220]  Excellent. As always, my good friend. How are you?
[2:01:36.220 --> 2:01:43.220]  I am excellent. Why don't you throw out the website right now so people can go there and check out what you've got going on?
[2:01:43.220 --> 2:01:57.220]  They can always go to WeAreChangedColorado.org. And on the site, we set up a DNC page where they can click the link titled DNC and find out everything we have planned for the DNC, our events,
[2:01:57.220 --> 2:02:07.220]  our park, our parade we have set up on Tuesday. We have a custom parade. We have a permit for with big floats, with replicas of the World Trade Center and everything.
[2:02:07.220 --> 2:02:16.220]  It's going to be one hell of a beautiful time out here for the DNC, and we want to get all the truthers out here to be present and have a strong presence.
[2:02:16.220 --> 2:02:23.220]  Excellent, Jonathan. Now, for those that don't know, why don't you tell them about the two screenings of Truth Rising?
[2:02:23.220 --> 2:02:30.220]  Luke Rudowski, Alex Jones are both going to be there. And then that is the first day of the DNC, I believe.
[2:02:30.220 --> 2:02:41.220]  And you're going to have some merch down there so that if people want to be identified as 9-11 Truthers or a tyranny response team, you're going to be able to provide that with them for the second day, correct?
[2:02:41.220 --> 2:02:55.220]  Yes, so Monday at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. at the Oriental Theater here in Denver. You can buy tickets online at theorionaltheater.com, or you can go to wearchangecolorado.org. Click on the DNC link, and the tickets are available there.
[2:02:55.220 --> 2:03:10.220]  And we are screening Truth Rising. Alex is going to speak. Luke will speak. And yes, we will be selling shirts, DVDs, everything, and just kind of preparing for all the events that we'll be following.
[2:03:10.220 --> 2:03:23.220]  The DNC goes until Thursday, and we have stuff lined up every day. We need as many Truthers out here as we can. If you know anybody out here in Denver, tell them about Truth Rising screening, get them out here.
[2:03:23.220 --> 2:03:31.220]  If you know delegates or attendees or anybody you can get to this showing, get them here, because this is the moment they can learn about the Truth Movement.
[2:03:31.220 --> 2:03:39.220]  We are a legitimate movement. We're a large movement, and we're growing. And they can see it, meet us, and learn about 9-11 too.
[2:03:39.220 --> 2:03:53.220]  And I mean, you got permits for the park that's only a thousand feet away from the convention center. I mean, you've worked really, really hard to make this an event where our voices can be heard, where we can shatter the left-right paradigm.
[2:03:53.220 --> 2:04:04.220]  Because a lot of people think that somehow Obama is going to save us all. He's changed. We can vote for. And he is the new savior. He is the new anointed one.
[2:04:04.220 --> 2:04:14.220]  I think that we do need a strong Truth or Presence out there to show, hey, we're not going to be fooled by this guy on the other side of the supposed spectrum.
[2:04:14.220 --> 2:04:30.220]  Exactly. We're going to have pretty much everything set up. The park is the Gates Crescent Park. We're going to be there the entire time, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
[2:04:30.220 --> 2:04:37.220]  We have the permit for it. And we're going to be congregating there every day with booths, tables, everything.
[2:04:37.220 --> 2:04:40.220]  And getting that information, flaring, bantering.
[2:04:40.220 --> 2:05:01.220]  All right, more information with Jonathan Ellenoff after this little Enio Marcon, the Ecstasy of Gold, to bring us out Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.com.

[2:07:12.220 --> 2:07:21.220]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation. Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[2:07:21.220 --> 2:07:29.220]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate. It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[2:07:29.220 --> 2:07:32.220]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[2:07:32.220 --> 2:07:37.220]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[2:07:37.220 --> 2:07:44.220]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation. America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:50.220]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late! The prophecies are fast fulfilling. Jesus is coming soon!
[2:07:50.220 --> 2:08:00.220]  For free materials call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee 37771.
[2:08:00.220 --> 2:08:07.220]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:11.220 --> 2:08:15.220]  Alright folks, we are back. It is the Alex Jones show.
[2:08:15.220 --> 2:08:23.220]  We are joined by Jonathan Elinoff of We Are Changed Colorado. I mean, this guy has done so much, folks.
[2:08:23.220 --> 2:08:30.220]  I mean, first he was confronting people like Mitt Romney and throwing it on the web. I mean, he's got Truth Alliance.net.
[2:08:30.220 --> 2:08:35.220]  He's a hell of a writer. He even blogs a little bit over at LooseChange911.com.
[2:08:35.220 --> 2:08:39.220]  Some of our best stories come from there. But he's also a ground reporter.
[2:08:39.220 --> 2:08:44.220]  He went down to the detention camps at the DNC. He's the one that brought you that story.
[2:08:44.220 --> 2:08:48.220]  He's the one that brought you the story of the DNC drills.
[2:08:48.220 --> 2:08:55.220]  Although they said it wasn't for the DNC, give me a break. Black helicopters. Them throwing out little American flags.
[2:08:55.220 --> 2:09:02.220]  Wrapped in orange glow sticks and propaganda. I mean, we're living in some interesting times, don't you think, Jonathan?
[2:09:02.220 --> 2:09:09.220]  Oh, to say the least. I also wanted to make an announcement that we also have, if you go to TruthLines.net,
[2:09:09.220 --> 2:09:16.220]  we are going to be streaming four live video feeds from the DNC.
[2:09:16.220 --> 2:09:22.220]  This is live, and people can get the embeddable player right there at TruthLines.net,
[2:09:22.220 --> 2:09:26.220]  and we will be streaming pretty much every day of the event.
[2:09:26.220 --> 2:09:33.220]  Now, for a lot of people who do not know this, even though Monday is the beginning of the DNC, Sunday,
[2:09:33.220 --> 2:09:39.220]  there will be the End the Occupations rally downtown set up by a couple of the groups.
[2:09:39.220 --> 2:09:45.220]  They don't have permits for this, and this is the one that's been talked about for the last, oh, four months or so.
[2:09:45.220 --> 2:09:49.220]  That is controversial. They don't have permits for this. We don't know what's going to happen.
[2:09:49.220 --> 2:09:59.220]  They've been threatened with arrest. They're planning roadblocks. They're planning surrounding cars and stuff.
[2:09:59.220 --> 2:10:08.220]  They're planning pure provocateur violence. They're trying to incite a riot without any semblance of sanity,
[2:10:08.220 --> 2:10:14.220]  and I'm kind of surprised that they're doing this the last day. I think it might be because it's the first day.
[2:10:14.220 --> 2:10:17.220]  Oh, that doesn't shock me at all. Of course, they want to do it on Sunday.
[2:10:17.220 --> 2:10:23.220]  They would like to do it so that they can cut off any kind of dissent after that fact. It's unbelievable.
[2:10:23.220 --> 2:10:30.220]  It is unbelievable, and we just don't understand, well, we're starting to learn now what's really going on.
[2:10:30.220 --> 2:10:32.220]  Well, let's elaborate on that a little bit.
[2:10:32.220 --> 2:10:35.220]  Number one, we're also going to be having streams all over infowars.com.
[2:10:35.220 --> 2:10:39.220]  They'll be streaming live, so everybody's going to be able to see this.
[2:10:39.220 --> 2:10:42.220]  It's going to be on the web everywhere. People are going to be taking hard recordings.
[2:10:42.220 --> 2:10:45.220]  So whatever goes down, they're not going to get away with.
[2:10:45.220 --> 2:10:52.220]  But earlier in the day, you, Alex, and Luke actually debated one of the guys from Recreate68, correct?
[2:10:52.220 --> 2:11:01.220]  Yes, and just to be clear, the articles are very clear.
[2:11:01.220 --> 2:11:07.220]  I wrote three articles about Recreate68, RAIMD, Unconventional Action, all the different groups,
[2:11:07.220 --> 2:11:14.220]  and I've always defended it with sources. It's well backed. We have recordings, we have articles, everything.
[2:11:14.220 --> 2:11:20.220]  And these guys are very upset because I was successful at breaking up their group.
[2:11:20.220 --> 2:11:24.220]  But the thing is, they were setting up actions that were going to get protesters arrested.
[2:11:24.220 --> 2:11:26.220]  There's no real debate on this.
[2:11:26.220 --> 2:11:31.220]  There's no debate. They had a shield book, Jonathan. They wanted people to show up in armor
[2:11:31.220 --> 2:11:36.220]  and to have shields and bring red paint and destroy cameras and destroy property
[2:11:36.220 --> 2:11:42.220]  and be a nuisance. They had no reason for that other than to get people arrested
[2:11:42.220 --> 2:11:45.220]  and make us look like vile creatures.
[2:11:45.220 --> 2:11:49.220]  Well, and they also had, they actually can't, because of the article I wrote,
[2:11:49.220 --> 2:11:55.220]  they canceled one of the actions that they were planning, which was called Shake Your Money Maker,
[2:11:55.220 --> 2:11:59.220]  which is a protest, as far as I know they camped at least,
[2:11:59.220 --> 2:12:05.220]  where they were going to surround the Denver Monument and attempt to levitate the building
[2:12:05.220 --> 2:12:09.220]  and Glenn and all those guys were going to hand out bags with money symbols on them.
[2:12:09.220 --> 2:12:11.220]  And we didn't understand what the message was for this.
[2:12:11.220 --> 2:12:16.220]  There's a coin mint here in Denver and we talked to the security guard there.
[2:12:16.220 --> 2:12:22.220]  If you touch or vandalize that fence or congregate around it, they can actually shoot you is what he said.
[2:12:22.220 --> 2:12:28.220]  And it's a serious facility. This is where money is, this stamp, coin money is printed.
[2:12:28.220 --> 2:12:32.220]  And they wanted to surround the Denver Monument and levitate the building.
[2:12:32.220 --> 2:12:40.220]  In other words, New Age nonsense to get people hurt. How ignorant are we?
[2:12:40.220 --> 2:12:45.220]  I mean, let's be adults and let's see what works.
[2:12:45.220 --> 2:12:49.220]  You know what doesn't work? Breaking the law, okay?
[2:12:49.220 --> 2:12:54.220]  Obviously civil disobedience is a good thing. It's been around for a while.
[2:12:54.220 --> 2:12:59.220]  This is uncivil disobedience. This is felonizing protesters.
[2:12:59.220 --> 2:13:08.220]  This is insanity to me, Jonathan, and I am just so thankful for people like you that exposed, you know, the masses to this,
[2:13:08.220 --> 2:13:15.220]  including myself. I mean, I had a friend call me up from Portland who I went to college with one of my really, really good friends
[2:13:15.220 --> 2:13:22.220]  and he's like, well, what do I do? He's like, well, my buddy is actually going down to the DNC this year with the Recreate 68 folks
[2:13:22.220 --> 2:13:26.220]  and I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, Recreate 68. And he's like, yeah, what's up?
[2:13:26.220 --> 2:13:30.220]  And I sent him the website and I sent him the shield book and he's like, oh my God.
[2:13:30.220 --> 2:13:32.220]  And he's like, this is terrible. And I'm like, yeah, it's terrible.
[2:13:32.220 --> 2:13:38.220]  I'm like, they're provocateurs just like at the WTO in Seattle in 2000.
[2:13:38.220 --> 2:13:44.220]  You need to tell your roommate this. And he told his roommate and he showed him the stuff and his roommate was blown away.
[2:13:44.220 --> 2:13:50.220]  And you know, they want a huge leftist presence there. I mean, obviously Rage Against the Machine is going to be there.
[2:13:50.220 --> 2:13:57.220]  The flowbots are going to be there. The coup is going to be there. A couple of those bands, obviously I'm very enamored with and I like a lot.
[2:13:57.220 --> 2:14:05.220]  But they also stay in that paradigm. And I do remember the last time Rage Against the Machine through a concert.
[2:14:05.220 --> 2:14:12.220]  I think it was at the LA Convention Center in 2000 on behalf of the elections then for Al Gore.
[2:14:12.220 --> 2:14:18.220]  And it was just a rubber bullet barrage by the cops. I worry about that.
[2:14:18.220 --> 2:14:24.220]  We worry about it too. You know, they set up big detention facilities here in Denver for mass arrest.
[2:14:24.220 --> 2:14:32.220]  And yeah, and the thing is, is some of these other groups like Unconventional Action are open on their website about property destruction.
[2:14:32.220 --> 2:14:36.220]  They totally agree with it in roadblocks, even though these are arrestable offenses.
[2:14:36.220 --> 2:14:45.220]  And the most important thing to remember is that, you know, these people are open about, you know, I'm not making accusations.
[2:14:45.220 --> 2:14:51.220]  I can't source. They're open about it. It's all right there. People can look at it and they can see with their own eyes.
[2:14:51.220 --> 2:14:56.220]  It's downloadable, Jonathan. I mean, they've put it out there in the public eye.
[2:14:56.220 --> 2:15:08.220]  But because it's not parroted in the mainstream as something bad, and it's only heard kind of in the backdrop when Rush Limbaugh talks about saying he's dreaming of riots in Denver.
[2:15:08.220 --> 2:15:10.220]  Well, that's a talking point.
[2:15:10.220 --> 2:15:15.220]  It is. And it's all, what's funny about it is they dug their own hole here.
[2:15:15.220 --> 2:15:28.220]  And the, you know, with all these accusations being thrown around, the important thing to remember here is, you know, people cannot just look up this stuff online and see it right there.
[2:15:28.220 --> 2:15:34.220]  And it's all available. It's all sourced. But it all boils down to one thing.
[2:15:34.220 --> 2:15:47.220]  There's no way, and this is the irony of it, by the way, Jason, the Shake Your Money Maker and some of these other events, one of them was to surround the federal courthouse and demand the release of political prisoners.
[2:15:47.220 --> 2:15:54.220]  Is it just a coincidence that the Denver Mint is caddy corner to the police headquarters that's set up downtown?
[2:15:54.220 --> 2:16:01.220]  Is it just a coincidence that it's right next to literally across the street from the Denver courthouse where all the court cases can be heard?
[2:16:01.220 --> 2:16:04.220]  Where they can process you in less than 20 feet.
[2:16:04.220 --> 2:16:19.220]  Exactly. I mean, we're talking about, and that was one of the first things I noticed is these actions were designed to not just rile up the protesters and get them all pissed off, but to put them at arm's length away from cops waiting right there.
[2:16:19.220 --> 2:16:22.220]  I mean, it was, we're talking about direct confrontation here.
[2:16:22.220 --> 2:16:34.220]  And, you know, I saw this six months ago, and I was pretty much the first person who blew the whistle on all of this, and I immediately put two and two together, and I saw two trains headed toward each other at, you know, 100 miles an hour.
[2:16:34.220 --> 2:16:45.220]  And it's pretty simple if anyone sees it. Now, I've been accused like I was this morning of lying and this and the other, and they actually completely misquoted me about a bunch of stuff.
[2:16:45.220 --> 2:16:55.220]  The reality of fact is I've stuck with my story the entire time. Everything's been set online. And, you know, if I wasn't telling the truth, I couldn't be held accountable for that.
[2:16:55.220 --> 2:16:59.220]  But the reason why they don't go after me is because it's fact. They're open about it.
[2:16:59.220 --> 2:17:02.220]  I was actually praised by the local paper for the work that I did.
[2:17:02.220 --> 2:17:10.220]  And the most important thing to remember is that not only did I get respected for what I did, Recreate-68 broke up.
[2:17:10.220 --> 2:17:18.220]  A whole bunch of their members created a new group called Alliance for Real Democracy. They broke away from Recreate-68 because they agreed with my article.
[2:17:18.220 --> 2:17:28.220]  They came out and said, yes, the name is Recreate-68. It sounds like they're going to recreate the violence. It sends the message of recreating the violence that happened in 68.
[2:17:28.220 --> 2:17:35.220]  It's a horrible thing in that they needed to distance themselves from the groups. They created this new group, Alliance for Real Democracy.
[2:17:35.220 --> 2:17:46.220]  They did that because I was right and they agreed with me. And what did they do? They banned Rear Change from being a part of Alliance for Real Democracy because we hurt the progressive relationship that they have.
[2:17:46.220 --> 2:17:57.220]  Well, that's tough. It's too bad that when you want to tell the truth and you don't want to be put into this, again, false left-right paradigm, this false conservative liberal paradigm,
[2:17:57.220 --> 2:18:07.220]  this false, you know, you have to be for Barack Obama or your against-change paradigm. They don't want you to take part in it, Jonathan.
[2:18:07.220 --> 2:18:11.220]  Jonathan, the website is wearchangecolorado.org, correct?
[2:18:11.220 --> 2:18:12.220]  Yes.
[2:18:12.220 --> 2:18:14.220]  And all the information is there, correct?
[2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:21.220]  Everything's on wearchangecolorado.org for the DNC. They can still get all my articles on truthalliance.net.
[2:18:21.220 --> 2:18:25.220]  And everything's been available since all this went down at the very beginning.
[2:18:25.220 --> 2:18:32.220]  All right, let's take a couple of callers. We've got a couple of ones holding. Let's go to Jameson in Florida. Jameson, are you with us?
[2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:33.220]  Hello?
[2:18:33.220 --> 2:18:34.220]  Hey, man, what's on your mind?
[2:18:34.220 --> 2:18:46.220]  Oh, yeah. I'm down in Florida and they just hit. And this, the continuity of government thing, it's really like a preview, I think, of what we're going to see in the future.
[2:18:46.220 --> 2:18:58.220]  Well, absolutely. I mean, continuity of government's been around for a while, and even in your state of Florida, on September 7th, you know, Marshall Law was declared in 2001 before the attacks, and it went on throughout the attacks.
[2:18:58.220 --> 2:19:07.220]  And, you know, isn't it a coincidence that Jeb Bush is the governor of Florida and his daddy is the one that revamped the entire COG program?
[2:19:07.220 --> 2:19:20.220]  Yeah, but like, it's like what they do here with the flooding, like they let the drainage systems deteriorate, and then they put up roadblocks and they pretty much have a control grid on the whole city.
[2:19:20.220 --> 2:19:31.220]  Well, obviously they're trying to control, you know, I mean, just look at Katrina, whether you think, you know, they bombed the levees or anything like that, the police reaction was unbelievable.
[2:19:31.220 --> 2:19:41.220]  They literally warded them off at the bridges and would not let them cross, would not let food or water get to them. Why is that? It's because it's all about control.
[2:19:41.220 --> 2:19:47.220]  Jameson, thank you so much for the call. Jonathan, thank you for popping in. I know you've got another interview to do right after this.
[2:19:47.220 --> 2:20:01.220]  We are ChangeColorado.org. I'm Jason Bermas of the Alex Jones Show. We'll be back after this.
[2:20:01.220 --> 2:20:08.220]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:20:08.220 --> 2:20:12.220]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:20:12.220 --> 2:20:13.220]  Bin Laden.
[2:20:13.220 --> 2:20:14.220]  This is his MO.
[2:20:14.220 --> 2:20:17.220]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:20:17.220 --> 2:20:24.220]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:20:24.220 --> 2:20:31.220]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:20:31.220 --> 2:20:35.220]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:20:35.220 --> 2:20:45.220]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:20:45.220 --> 2:20:54.220]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:20:54.220 --> 2:21:01.220]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:21:01.220 --> 2:21:05.220]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[2:21:05.220 --> 2:21:18.220]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[2:21:18.220 --> 2:21:24.220]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[2:21:24.220 --> 2:21:32.220]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%. It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[2:21:32.220 --> 2:21:39.220]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[2:23:05.220 --> 2:23:06.220]  Worse.
[2:23:06.220 --> 2:23:10.220]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[2:23:10.220 --> 2:23:15.220]  Question. Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[2:23:15.220 --> 2:23:21.220]  Question. Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[2:24:21.220 --> 2:24:27.220]  Nothing like a little funk to keep it going.
[2:24:27.220 --> 2:24:30.220]  I feel like I'm in like a 70s shack.
[2:24:30.220 --> 2:24:34.220]  It's the Alex Jones show. I am Jason Burmes.
[2:24:34.220 --> 2:24:37.220]  We're about to have Shane Geiger on in the next segment.
[2:24:37.220 --> 2:24:40.220]  But before that, I want to play a little segment.
[2:24:40.220 --> 2:24:43.220]  And by the way, we're going to keep taking your calls all day long.
[2:24:43.220 --> 2:24:48.220]  I want to play a little segment from Terror Storm about Building 7.
[2:24:48.220 --> 2:24:52.220]  One of the many great documentaries that Alex Jones has put out that you can watch.
[2:24:52.220 --> 2:24:56.220]  As a PrisonPlanet.tv member in super high quality, let me tell you,
[2:24:56.220 --> 2:25:00.220]  I just encoded fabled enemies in all three versions for DivX.
[2:25:00.220 --> 2:25:03.220]  The small version, I think it's like 250 megabytes.
[2:25:03.220 --> 2:25:08.220]  The medium is like 440, and I think the large one is only 560, and it looks awesome.
[2:25:08.220 --> 2:25:10.220]  It is almost DVD quality.
[2:25:10.220 --> 2:25:15.220]  If you burn it to a disc and you play it on your TV, you're not going to know the difference.
[2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:17.220]  Become a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber.
[2:25:17.220 --> 2:25:20.220]  It's less than, I think it's less than 65 cents a day.
[2:25:20.220 --> 2:25:23.220]  It's so cheap. I mean, it's less than a cup of coffee a day.
[2:25:23.220 --> 2:25:25.220]  Alright, let's listen to it.
[2:25:25.220 --> 2:25:28.220]  It is from Terror Storm, the World Trade Center 7 section.
[2:25:28.220 --> 2:25:30.220]  It's amazing.
[2:25:30.220 --> 2:25:33.220]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[2:25:33.220 --> 2:25:40.220]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before,
[2:25:40.220 --> 2:25:45.220]  when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[2:25:45.220 --> 2:25:53.220]  We have the owner of the World Trade Center complex admitting on tape that he ordered the building demolished on the afternoon of 9-11.
[2:25:53.220 --> 2:25:56.220]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[2:25:56.220 --> 2:26:04.220]  One of the things to do is pull it, and they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.
[2:26:04.220 --> 2:26:17.220]  During our on-the-ground investigations in New York City over the last five plus years,
[2:26:17.220 --> 2:26:24.220]  we've talked to scores of eyewitnesses who had claimed that police and firemen told them to get back from Building 7
[2:26:24.220 --> 2:26:27.220]  because it was going to be brought down or, quote, explode.
[2:26:27.220 --> 2:26:33.220]  Building 7, while I was listening to live feed from our local public radio station later in the afternoon,
[2:26:33.220 --> 2:26:34.220]  they talked about Building 7.
[2:26:34.220 --> 2:26:36.220]  Building 7 was fine.
[2:26:36.220 --> 2:26:41.220]  There was no airplane that hit it, and then they even began to ruminate on the air about demolishing the building.
[2:26:41.220 --> 2:26:43.220]  I said, well, I don't know.
[2:26:43.220 --> 2:26:45.220]  I mean, you can put out fires.
[2:26:45.220 --> 2:26:50.220]  You know, why would you talk about demolishing a building that, you know, it wasn't hit by anything?
[2:26:50.220 --> 2:26:52.220]  You know, the fires weren't bad or anything like that.
[2:26:52.220 --> 2:26:58.220]  I will say that I spoke to a cop on 9-11 who said that it was going to come down.
[2:26:58.220 --> 2:27:00.220]  I don't know how he knew that.
[2:27:00.220 --> 2:27:07.220]  Now, archive CNN footage has surfaced showing video footage of a New York City police officer
[2:27:07.220 --> 2:27:14.220]  telling cameramen and civilians to get back from Building 7 because the building was going to blow up.
[2:27:14.220 --> 2:27:40.220]  MUSIC
[2:27:40.220 --> 2:27:42.220]  Just in the last few seconds,
[2:27:42.220 --> 2:27:50.220]  another building, Building 7, one of the buildings in support of the World Trade Center towers has collapsed.
[2:27:50.220 --> 2:27:54.220]  MUSIC
[2:27:54.220 --> 2:27:57.220]  This is no small building, as you can see.
[2:27:57.220 --> 2:28:01.220]  At 47 stories, it would stand out in most American cities.
[2:28:01.220 --> 2:28:06.220]  MUSIC
[2:28:06.220 --> 2:28:10.220]  And then, in late February of 2007,
[2:28:10.220 --> 2:28:16.220]  9-11 researchers reviewing archives of live news coverage from September 11
[2:28:16.220 --> 2:28:21.220]  discovered to their shock that BBC World had reported that Building 7,
[2:28:21.220 --> 2:28:25.220]  also known as the Solomon Brothers Building, had completely collapsed
[2:28:25.220 --> 2:28:29.220]  over 20 minutes before its actual implosion.
[2:28:29.220 --> 2:28:33.220]  First anchors at the London News Desk reported it.
[2:28:33.220 --> 2:28:38.220]  Now, more on the latest building collapse in New York you might have heard a few moments ago
[2:28:38.220 --> 2:28:41.220]  as talking about the Solomon Brothers Building collapsing.
[2:28:41.220 --> 2:28:45.220]  And indeed, it has. Apparently, that's only a few hundred yards away from where the...
[2:28:45.220 --> 2:28:49.220]  They then cut to BBC reporter Jane Stanley in New York,
[2:28:49.220 --> 2:28:53.220]  who also reported that the Solomon Brothers Building had fallen
[2:28:53.220 --> 2:28:58.220]  all the while with the building clearly visible behind her through the window.
[2:28:58.220 --> 2:29:00.220]  Our correspondent, Jane Stanley.
[2:29:00.220 --> 2:29:04.220]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Solomon Brothers Building and its collapse?
[2:29:04.220 --> 2:29:09.220]  Well, only really what you already know details are very, very sketchy.
[2:29:09.220 --> 2:29:13.220]  There's almost a sense down town in New York behind me,
[2:29:13.220 --> 2:29:17.220]  down by the World Trade Centers of just an area completely closed off
[2:29:17.220 --> 2:29:21.220]  as the rescue workers try to do their job.
[2:29:21.220 --> 2:29:25.220]  But this isn't the first building that has suffered as a result.
[2:29:25.220 --> 2:29:29.220]  We know that part of the Marriott Hotel next to the World Trade Center
[2:29:29.220 --> 2:29:34.220]  also collapsed as a result of this huge amount of falling debris
[2:29:34.220 --> 2:29:39.220]  from 110 floors to the two twin towers of the World Trade Center.
[2:29:39.220 --> 2:29:41.220]  As you can see behind me...
[2:29:41.220 --> 2:29:44.220]  All right, folks. I think you get the gist.
[2:29:44.220 --> 2:29:48.220]  It's the Alex Jones Show. We'll be back with Shane Geiger after this.
[2:29:51.220 --> 2:29:55.220]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.220 --> 2:29:59.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:27.220 --> 2:30:30.220]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[2:30:30.220 --> 2:30:33.220]  a global awakening has taken place.
[2:30:33.220 --> 2:30:37.220]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:30:40.220 --> 2:30:44.220]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:30:44.220 --> 2:30:47.220]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:30:47.220 --> 2:30:50.220]  The government has not told the truth in five years.
[2:30:50.220 --> 2:30:53.220]  We will be here on the 10th anniversary of...
[2:31:01.220 --> 2:31:05.220]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[2:31:05.220 --> 2:31:07.220]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[2:31:07.220 --> 2:31:11.220]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel,
[2:31:11.220 --> 2:31:14.220]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[2:31:14.220 --> 2:31:18.220]  I've organized a contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston,
[2:31:18.220 --> 2:31:21.220]  online from my desk with WebEx.
[2:31:21.220 --> 2:31:24.220]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:31:24.220 --> 2:31:26.220]  I just talked to clients on the phone,
[2:31:26.220 --> 2:31:29.220]  and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop,
[2:31:29.220 --> 2:31:33.220]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[2:32:05.220 --> 2:32:09.220]  Stress increases blood pressure, potential heart problems, strokes, ulcers,
[2:32:09.220 --> 2:32:14.220]  depression, and insomnia. Stress suppresses your immune system and inhibits weight control.
[2:32:14.220 --> 2:32:17.220]  Stress makes you nervous, anxious, or irritable.

[2:33:46.220 --> 2:33:50.220]  We're about to bring on InfoWars freelance reporter Shane Geiger.
[2:33:50.220 --> 2:33:54.220]  A guy with a lot of motivation came down to the office last week in Texas.
[2:33:54.220 --> 2:33:58.220]  We are in Austin, Texas. Folks said, hey, I'd really like to go cover this.
[2:33:58.220 --> 2:34:02.220]  Can you guys help me out with some press passes and Aaron talked to him for a little while?
[2:34:02.220 --> 2:34:05.220]  And he said, you know, of course, you can go on behalf of us.
[2:34:05.220 --> 2:34:06.220]  We'll see what we can do.
[2:34:06.220 --> 2:34:08.220]  He then contacted NIST.
[2:34:08.220 --> 2:34:11.220]  NIST then contacted us to make sure that he was with us.
[2:34:11.220 --> 2:34:14.220]  The guy from NIST was actually pretty sympathetic and had heard of InfoWars.
[2:34:14.220 --> 2:34:16.220]  I was kind of shocked.
[2:34:16.220 --> 2:34:17.220]  And he went down there.
[2:34:17.220 --> 2:34:23.220]  I mean, it is no small trip from Texas to Maryland and actually was at the conference.
[2:34:23.220 --> 2:34:26.220]  Now, we're going to play a CNN clip where they kind of cut him short,
[2:34:26.220 --> 2:34:31.220]  but they do acknowledge his presence and they also acknowledge loose change.
[2:34:31.220 --> 2:34:33.220]  But according to Wolf Blitzer, it's all Shane.
[2:34:33.220 --> 2:34:35.220]  So we're going to go to that clip and come back to Shane Geiger.
[2:34:35.220 --> 2:34:37.220]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[2:34:37.220 --> 2:34:46.220]  I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the situation.
[2:34:46.220 --> 2:34:52.220]  The Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were the only buildings that crumbled on September 11, 2001.
[2:34:52.220 --> 2:34:58.220]  A neighboring building, the World Trade Center building number seven also came down,
[2:34:58.220 --> 2:35:02.220]  but no one was sure why until now.
[2:35:02.220 --> 2:35:03.220]  Let's go to Deb Rafferick.
[2:35:03.220 --> 2:35:04.220]  She's working this story for us.
[2:35:04.220 --> 2:35:07.220]  Deb, what are the experts now saying?
[2:35:07.220 --> 2:35:12.220]  Well, there's a new report and the findings come after three years of studying the collapse of building seven
[2:35:12.220 --> 2:35:13.220]  just across from the North Tower.
[2:35:13.220 --> 2:35:18.220]  This was done using complex computer models, detailed analysis, and eyewitness accounts.
[2:35:18.220 --> 2:35:21.220]  So why doesn't everyone buy it?
[2:35:21.220 --> 2:35:24.220]  It has been a mystery since 9-11.
[2:35:24.220 --> 2:35:30.220]  Why did World Trade Center building seven collapse nearly seven hours after the Twin Towers fell?
[2:35:30.220 --> 2:35:32.220]  Was it diesel fuel in the building?
[2:35:32.220 --> 2:35:34.220]  Or planted explosives?
[2:35:34.220 --> 2:35:41.220]  A controlled demolition of government offices as conspiracy theorists allege in films like loose change.
[2:35:41.220 --> 2:35:48.220]  A team of scientists and engineers authorized by Congress says there's only one answer and it's conclusive.
[2:35:48.220 --> 2:35:52.220]  The collapse of World Trade Center seven was primarily due to fires.
[2:35:52.220 --> 2:36:01.220]  This is the first time that we are aware of that a building over 15 stories tall has collapsed primarily due to fire.
[2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:08.220]  Shyam Sunder, the study's lead investigator, says fires ignited by falling debris from the towers burned so hot
[2:36:08.220 --> 2:36:15.220]  they created a phenomenon in which steel and concrete floors failed, causing floors to buckle and a key column to cave.
[2:36:15.220 --> 2:36:21.220]  For the first time we have shown that fire can induce a progressive collapse.
[2:36:21.220 --> 2:36:30.220]  Fires burned out of control on six of ten floors in building seven where New York City's multi-million dollar emergency command center had recently been built.
[2:36:30.220 --> 2:36:36.220]  And because the city's water main was cut when the towers fell, sprinkler systems in the building did not work.
[2:36:36.220 --> 2:36:41.220]  Still, conspiracy theorists and others were not swayed by the new findings.
[2:36:41.220 --> 2:36:48.220]  Investigators say they did consider certain so-called conspiracy theories, but none held up.
[2:36:48.220 --> 2:36:55.220]  Alternative theories are really none of them have been found to be credible.
[2:36:55.220 --> 2:37:02.220]  Fire expert Glenn Corbett analyzed the Trade Center collapse and says the new report could be used to make high rises safer.
[2:37:02.220 --> 2:37:06.220]  I'm hoping that the next steps will be to actually make changes to buildings.
[2:37:06.220 --> 2:37:12.220]  Alright, let's cut it. You know, the end is a complete whitewash where they say, oh, we're going to try to make them safer.
[2:37:12.220 --> 2:37:15.220]  And the person who was talking about those bare assertions joins us.
[2:37:15.220 --> 2:37:17.220]  Thanks for coming on, Shane.
[2:37:17.220 --> 2:37:19.220]  Yeah, my pleasure. Thanks for having me.
[2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:21.220]  Well, absolutely. Well, why don't you just take us through it?
[2:37:21.220 --> 2:37:25.220]  First of all, the trip to Maryland, did you drove, I assume?
[2:37:25.220 --> 2:37:28.220]  No, I booked a flight last minute.
[2:37:28.220 --> 2:37:38.220]  One of the techniques that NIST was employing to keep people from, you know, coming showing up and criticizing them apparently,
[2:37:38.220 --> 2:37:44.220]  was to, you know, publish the actual date and time of the meeting at the last minute.
[2:37:44.220 --> 2:37:48.220]  Yeah, it only came out like a day and a half before the actual thing, right?
[2:37:48.220 --> 2:37:56.220]  Day and a half, two and a half days. Yeah, I think it was maybe Monday night or Tuesday night when I got the email about this.
[2:37:56.220 --> 2:37:59.220]  And I kind of mulled it over and decided, yeah, I want to go.
[2:37:59.220 --> 2:38:09.220]  But thanks to Brave New Books, the really awesome bookstore in Austin where I've met a number of nice people and discussed 9-11.
[2:38:09.220 --> 2:38:12.220]  Yeah, Matt Connor is a really good guy over there.
[2:38:12.220 --> 2:38:16.220]  Yeah, Matt Connor, Harlan, John, all great guys.
[2:38:16.220 --> 2:38:19.220]  Absolutely. And I got to ask you, now you get in there.
[2:38:19.220 --> 2:38:21.220]  Okay, because we only got you until 2 o'clock.
[2:38:21.220 --> 2:38:23.220]  Now, we're talking about the bare assertions.
[2:38:23.220 --> 2:38:29.220]  Now, they said that the fires were hundreds of degrees below what they first suspected could do anything like this.
[2:38:29.220 --> 2:38:32.220]  That's in there like a little official spiel.
[2:38:32.220 --> 2:38:39.220]  Then they also say that they didn't even have any steel from the World Trade Center 7 to test, correct?
[2:38:39.220 --> 2:38:45.220]  Right, yeah, in NCSTAR 1-3, you can just Google this.
[2:38:45.220 --> 2:38:52.220]  They state that they don't have any of the World Trade Center 7 building steel.
[2:38:52.220 --> 2:38:59.220]  So they had some charts on them and some charts at the front of the room yesterday.
[2:38:59.220 --> 2:39:04.220]  And now I was just asking myself, how in the heck is it that they drew these charts?
[2:39:04.220 --> 2:39:09.220]  These are not actual, these are not actually based on physical evidence.
[2:39:09.220 --> 2:39:13.220]  These are just imagined bowing trusses.
[2:39:13.220 --> 2:39:19.220]  There's so many bare assertions that don't have evidence to actually back them up.
[2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:26.220]  When you do science, the idea is you do experiments to test your hypothesis.
[2:39:26.220 --> 2:39:33.220]  Exactly, and this computer model that they did, they did not apply any of the physics or physical properties of these steel beams to that.
[2:39:33.220 --> 2:39:36.220]  It was indeed just a computer animation.
[2:39:36.220 --> 2:39:41.220]  In other words, something that somebody had predetermined and then animated not based on actual physics.
[2:39:41.220 --> 2:39:43.220]  Again, correct?
[2:39:43.220 --> 2:39:45.220]  Exactly, exactly.
[2:39:45.220 --> 2:39:47.220]  Yeah, you can make a simulation, do anything.
[2:39:47.220 --> 2:39:50.220]  You know, you can make a donkey talk.
[2:39:50.220 --> 2:39:52.220]  Like, you know, this is the age of Hollywood.
[2:39:52.220 --> 2:39:53.220]  Like track.
[2:39:53.220 --> 2:39:54.220]  Yeah, it could be like track.
[2:39:54.220 --> 2:39:56.220]  Exactly, exactly.
[2:39:56.220 --> 2:39:59.220]  It's ridiculous to think that this is a proof.
[2:39:59.220 --> 2:40:06.220]  However, there are some bits of evidence that are being found in the World Trade Center dust that you can actually verify.
[2:40:06.220 --> 2:40:11.220]  You can go to the USGS website and see pictures of the iron-rich spheres,
[2:40:11.220 --> 2:40:16.220]  which are evidence of temperatures of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit, in excess of that.
[2:40:16.220 --> 2:40:21.220]  In fact, these are the temperatures necessary to liquefy iron,
[2:40:21.220 --> 2:40:25.220]  and the National Institute of Standards and Technology report on the twin towers,
[2:40:25.220 --> 2:40:36.220]  and apparently also the one on building 7 states merely that the temperatures got up to roughly 1100 C or 2012 degrees Fahrenheit,
[2:40:36.220 --> 2:40:40.220]  temperatures that are merely hot enough to weaken the steel.
[2:40:40.220 --> 2:40:47.220]  But the problem is, you know, we've got some liquid iron, you know, this is the major component of steel.
[2:40:47.220 --> 2:40:50.220]  We've got this at the scene of the crime, and...
[2:40:50.220 --> 2:40:52.220]  And on video, pouring out of the building, by the way.
[2:40:52.220 --> 2:40:54.220]  Not just on the scene of the crime, not just multiple...
[2:40:54.220 --> 2:40:58.220]  Yeah, and they made the bare assertion concerning that video.
[2:40:58.220 --> 2:41:02.220]  The Peter Jennings broadcast shows it on nationwide television.
[2:41:02.220 --> 2:41:06.220]  You've got this orange metal flowing out of the South Tower minutes before it collapses,
[2:41:06.220 --> 2:41:16.220]  and they state in their FAQ that, you know, this is probably molten aluminum mixed with organics or something else.
[2:41:16.220 --> 2:41:18.220]  And it was absolutely disproven by Stephen Jones.
[2:41:18.220 --> 2:41:21.220]  There is no way that molten aluminum would have glowed that way,
[2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:26.220]  would have reached that far down without solidifying, or given that kind of texture.
[2:41:26.220 --> 2:41:32.220]  It was completely disproven, and then the debunkers had to jump on that and say,
[2:41:32.220 --> 2:41:36.220]  well, if it isn't molten aluminum, it's got to be batteries from the building.
[2:41:36.220 --> 2:41:38.220]  I mean, these guys will say anything.
[2:41:38.220 --> 2:41:45.220]  Right. Yeah, or throw the fly ash in there, or the other things for which they have no substantiating experiment.
[2:41:45.220 --> 2:41:48.220]  You know, this is so ridiculous. You see this over and over again.
[2:41:48.220 --> 2:41:55.220]  I like to tell people, you know, this is the way you can tell whether or not, you know, 9-11 wasn't an inside job.
[2:41:55.220 --> 2:42:01.220]  You see, you look with the scientific method, you know, at who's doing science, and you can see,
[2:42:01.220 --> 2:42:03.220]  you know, it's ignoring evidence.
[2:42:03.220 --> 2:42:09.220]  They're making claims about experience that they didn't do, and later they had to admit they did do.
[2:42:09.220 --> 2:42:18.220]  And in fact, that's the brilliant work of Stephen Jones, Kevin Lyon, James Gurley.
[2:42:18.220 --> 2:42:21.220]  And Kevin Ryan, by the way, we're going to have on on Monday,
[2:42:21.220 --> 2:42:23.220]  and Richard Bader is going to be joining us at 2.30.
[2:42:23.220 --> 2:42:25.220]  I'm trying to get a hold of Stephen Jones.
[2:42:25.220 --> 2:42:28.220]  James Gurley, actually, I'm a good friend of,
[2:42:28.220 --> 2:42:32.220]  and I actually did a screening out in Dallas a few months ago with him.
[2:42:32.220 --> 2:42:35.220]  He's a good buddy of mine. He's a, you know, a very smart person, man.
[2:42:35.220 --> 2:42:40.220]  I mean, they're trying to put this together in a legal format, which they can no longer ignore.
[2:42:40.220 --> 2:42:42.220]  And they are having to back off certain things.
[2:42:42.220 --> 2:42:46.220]  Certain things they'll just straight up lie about, such as there was no loss of life in Building 7.
[2:42:46.220 --> 2:42:54.220]  But SIM Sunder went to Popular Mechanics years ago and said they had evidence that 25% of the building,
[2:42:54.220 --> 2:42:58.220]  or 10 complete stories, had been scooped out of World Trade Center 7,
[2:42:58.220 --> 2:43:03.220]  wherein this latest report that is nowhere in the diagram, there is nothing scooped out,
[2:43:03.220 --> 2:43:07.220]  and they have had to admit that the damage caused by World Trade Center 1 and 2 in their collapse
[2:43:07.220 --> 2:43:11.220]  had little to nothing to do with World Trade Center 7's collapse.
[2:43:11.220 --> 2:43:19.220]  I'm kind of thinking, Jason, that those photos, the videos, and whatnot that NIST is holding hostage for $19,000,
[2:43:19.220 --> 2:43:21.220]  might shed some light on all of this.
[2:43:21.220 --> 2:43:27.220]  But of course, you know, we're not so likely to see that unless we cough up at least $19,000.
[2:43:27.220 --> 2:43:30.220]  You know, the upper limit is whatever they decided is.
[2:43:30.220 --> 2:43:36.220]  Yeah, that's a lot of money to pony up to when you're an individual guy like me that's lucky to make that in a year.
[2:43:36.220 --> 2:43:40.220]  You know, it has to struggle and work 40 to 60 hours a week just to do that.
[2:43:40.220 --> 2:43:45.220]  But they do that on purpose because they want the slave class to just shut up and accept what they say.
[2:43:45.220 --> 2:43:53.220]  I mean, literally, Wolf Blitzer is on there saying, mystery solved. Well, I'll give Deborah Farrak a little bit of a, you know,
[2:43:53.220 --> 2:43:55.220]  I'll give her a little bit of an up.
[2:43:55.220 --> 2:43:59.220]  She's the one that came out to our house and interviewed us a couple years back.
[2:43:59.220 --> 2:44:04.220]  She was rather sympathetic. She's one of the few reporters that even put in the alternate hypothesis
[2:44:04.220 --> 2:44:08.220]  that even dared put you on the TV screen, that dared to mention loose change.
[2:44:08.220 --> 2:44:12.220]  And she was the one that actually did contact us to tell us that they were doing this news story.
[2:44:12.220 --> 2:44:15.220]  So, you know, a little bit of a shout out to Deborah Farrak.
[2:44:15.220 --> 2:44:20.220]  I hope you come around even further. I understand you work for CNN and it's highly corporatized.
[2:44:20.220 --> 2:44:26.220]  And there's only so much that you can say, but please keep trying to bring the people some semblance of the truth.
[2:44:26.220 --> 2:44:28.220]  All right, we've only got like 15 minutes.
[2:44:28.220 --> 2:44:31.220]  So I want you to describe what happened when you actually asked a question.
[2:44:31.220 --> 2:44:35.220]  I remember you mentioning yesterday that they shut the lights off on you.
[2:44:35.220 --> 2:44:43.220]  Yeah, this, you know, I kind of know what's going on here. And so when I booked this flight, I knew there was a chance
[2:44:43.220 --> 2:44:47.220]  that I wouldn't get to speak, you know, that they'd be reading the question.
[2:44:47.220 --> 2:44:51.220]  They asked me to actually send the question in the day before so they could preview it, you know,
[2:44:51.220 --> 2:44:54.220]  just to make sure that I don't ask anything they don't want me to ask.
[2:44:54.220 --> 2:45:00.220]  And so I was sitting there in this presentation and I heard time and time again,
[2:45:00.220 --> 2:45:06.220]  the most outrageous lie about finding no explosives, you know, which implies that they looked for explosives.
[2:45:06.220 --> 2:45:19.220]  And so I just pulled up in my notes the exchange of information between Dr. Jones, Kevin Ryan, James Gurley and others.
[2:45:19.220 --> 2:45:29.220]  And with this concerning the experiments that they supposedly done under the Data Quality Act,
[2:45:29.220 --> 2:45:38.220]  you are allowed to submit a request for correction to the federal agency if, you know,
[2:45:38.220 --> 2:45:42.220]  you have some reason to suspect that information is wrong, you know,
[2:45:42.220 --> 2:45:47.220]  some information that might affect, for instance, how you build buildings or something like that.
[2:45:47.220 --> 2:45:58.220]  And so anyway, the Data Quality Assurance Act was the means by which Jones, Ryan and others got this admission from NIST
[2:45:58.220 --> 2:46:00.220]  that they didn't do any experiments.
[2:46:00.220 --> 2:46:05.220]  Of course, this was, you know, this didn't hit the mainstream press at the time to, you know,
[2:46:05.220 --> 2:46:11.220]  an outrageous thing to make statements that, you know, you didn't find explosives when you didn't look for explosives.
[2:46:11.220 --> 2:46:17.220]  And I was sitting in the room yesterday with, you know, people from the mainstream media, you know,
[2:46:17.220 --> 2:46:24.220]  all the big groups and, you know, these people heard what I said and they did gather around after the meeting
[2:46:24.220 --> 2:46:30.220]  and talk to me about this a little bit, but I saw their reports today and they didn't follow up on this.
[2:46:30.220 --> 2:46:31.220]  I'm going to contact them.
[2:46:31.220 --> 2:46:35.220]  I'm going to see if I can get them to see this correctly.
[2:46:35.220 --> 2:46:40.220]  But, you know, I realize these people were there as, you know, career reporters.
[2:46:40.220 --> 2:46:42.220]  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
[2:46:42.220 --> 2:46:43.220]  Something on the line.
[2:46:43.220 --> 2:46:46.220]  Oh, there was no way that they were going to try to crack the case.
[2:46:46.220 --> 2:46:47.220]  Yeah.
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:48.220]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:46:48.220 --> 2:46:51.220]  Well, let me ask you, when did they shut the lights off?
[2:46:51.220 --> 2:46:53.220]  That's what I got to know. Like, were you in the middle of the question?
[2:46:53.220 --> 2:46:56.220]  All right. Go with that. Go with that.
[2:46:56.220 --> 2:47:02.220]  So just after that, you know, the blurb that you heard on CNN, they, you know, where I said there were a lot of bear assertions.
[2:47:02.220 --> 2:47:10.220]  I mentioned the beams, you know, the graphics that they had on these charts at the beginning of the, at the front of the room.
[2:47:10.220 --> 2:47:19.220]  And then I started into the information I had on the Data Quality Act request, you know, and missed submission.
[2:47:19.220 --> 2:47:25.220]  And I believe it was a little, there's a bit of a pause in my presentation.
[2:47:25.220 --> 2:47:29.220]  And somewhere along the lines there, the light went off just a little bit, my pause.
[2:47:29.220 --> 2:47:41.220]  And then what, in the middle of the Data Quality Act request portion of my presentation, I saw it quickly looked forward in the room.
[2:47:41.220 --> 2:47:45.220]  I saw two people off to the side waving their hands.
[2:47:45.220 --> 2:47:50.220]  Their arms were fully standing. Oh, God forbid you. No, no, no.
[2:47:50.220 --> 2:47:53.220]  The cover up. Hey, hey, Shane, I want you to finish the story about it.
[2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:56.220]  It's popped by the office and I'm going to leave. This is Alex Jones popping in.
[2:47:56.220 --> 2:48:04.220]  I was just listening in the car when I pulled to the office to you and Jason talking about how Wolf Blitzer is saying, this is it.
[2:48:04.220 --> 2:48:07.220]  Case closed. Same thing with they announced for a whole day.
[2:48:07.220 --> 2:48:10.220]  Case closed. We're going to show the plane at the Pentagon.
[2:48:10.220 --> 2:48:14.220]  Case closed and they show some white blur. It's like they want to keep it going or something.
[2:48:14.220 --> 2:48:21.220]  And listen, we need to get Paul Watson or Kurt Nemo or somebody now to do a headline about NIST.
[2:48:21.220 --> 2:48:28.220]  You know, NIST backs off a false claim of 25% of the building scooped out because that's another big deal.
[2:48:28.220 --> 2:48:35.220]  And we need to just point out that this is another complete collapse of what they're doing and the fact that they kept backing this off and off and off.
[2:48:35.220 --> 2:48:40.220]  But listen, I'm going to get out of here, but Jason, just make sure somebody does a story on this because I'm seeing all the other rundown stories.
[2:48:40.220 --> 2:48:42.220]  They're really not going over that.
[2:48:42.220 --> 2:48:46.220]  That is a big thing. They literally said a quarter of the building was gone and now that's retracted.
[2:48:46.220 --> 2:48:48.220]  And he said that they tested for explosives.
[2:48:48.220 --> 2:48:58.220]  But if you watch the official NIST three minute video, he simply says, well, the explosions that would have had to occur for a controlled demolition would have set off major decibel levels.
[2:48:58.220 --> 2:49:02.220]  And those decibel levels were in none of the actual videos or eyewitness.
[2:49:02.220 --> 2:49:04.220]  But they are. Boom, boom, boom.
[2:49:04.220 --> 2:49:06.220]  I know you can hear it and I'm sure.
[2:49:06.220 --> 2:49:12.220]  On some line, Sy Hersh now comes out and says, Cheney was planning to blow up her own ships confirmed.
[2:49:12.220 --> 2:49:14.220]  You know, Gulf of Tonkin, all this stuff's coming out.
[2:49:14.220 --> 2:49:18.220]  It's their criminal murderers and they're not going to stop.
[2:49:18.220 --> 2:49:22.220]  And I want to tell all the debunkers something because I woke up this morning about six a.m. thinking about this.
[2:49:22.220 --> 2:49:24.220]  I know I've said this before, but it really came home.
[2:49:24.220 --> 2:49:26.220]  It really hit me almost came in today to talk about this.
[2:49:26.220 --> 2:49:28.220]  Yes, I did.
[2:49:28.220 --> 2:49:41.220]  It's that my God, we've got former Italian presidents and German defense ministers and members of the parliament in England and Japan, Japan and Willie Nelson and governors and all these people.
[2:49:41.220 --> 2:49:44.220]  And they all had the courage to come out and say it was an inside job.
[2:49:44.220 --> 2:49:46.220]  And we've defeated the bastards.
[2:49:46.220 --> 2:49:47.220]  The majority of people.
[2:49:47.220 --> 2:49:49.220]  I mean, it's not common knowledge on the street.
[2:49:49.220 --> 2:49:53.220]  I want all the government debunkers and all you scum the orphaned or older to know you really have failed bastards.
[2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:57.220]  And now people understand false flag terror rush the top Russian general number two.
[2:49:57.220 --> 2:50:02.220]  General comes out and says NATO is planning false flags in Georgia dressed up like us.
[2:50:02.220 --> 2:50:10.220]  I mean, the cats out of the bag, your little favorite toy of murdering us and posing as our saviors is getting broken down is getting defeated.
[2:50:10.220 --> 2:50:12.220]  And so I am just so, so excited.
[2:50:12.220 --> 2:50:14.220]  And listen, I'm going to give you the rest of the time.
[2:50:14.220 --> 2:50:16.220]  It's just finished up with them waving.
[2:50:16.220 --> 2:50:18.220]  No, no.
[2:50:18.220 --> 2:50:21.220]  No, I love what how you put things into context.
[2:50:21.220 --> 2:50:24.220]  Historically, that's so important for people to, you know, grok.
[2:50:24.220 --> 2:50:25.220]  Think of how far we've come.
[2:50:25.220 --> 2:50:26.220]  Yeah, grok it.
[2:50:26.220 --> 2:50:28.220]  Think how far we have come.
[2:50:28.220 --> 2:50:29.220]  Think of what we've done.
[2:50:29.220 --> 2:50:31.220]  People say 9 11 truth.
[2:50:31.220 --> 2:50:33.220]  You know, it's it's hit the end of the line.
[2:50:33.220 --> 2:50:36.220]  No, that's government propaganda to make you think and people.
[2:50:36.220 --> 2:50:37.220]  Oh, I guess the war is over.
[2:50:37.220 --> 2:50:38.220]  I'll go home.
[2:50:38.220 --> 2:50:40.220]  It's better than it's ever been.
[2:50:40.220 --> 2:50:45.220]  Meanwhile, they try to insert ridiculous theories like no planes, bombs everywhere.
[2:50:45.220 --> 2:50:46.220]  None of it's going to work.
[2:50:46.220 --> 2:50:48.220]  Look, they're onto your crap murderers.
[2:50:48.220 --> 2:50:49.220]  It's over.
[2:50:49.220 --> 2:50:50.220]  I'm leaving.
[2:50:50.220 --> 2:50:51.220]  I'm going to get ready for Denver.

[2:52:01.260 --> 2:52:06.980]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:52:06.980 --> 2:52:08.460]  against this country.
[2:52:08.460 --> 2:52:12.180]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[2:52:12.180 --> 2:52:13.180]  Bin Laden.
[2:52:13.180 --> 2:52:14.180]  This is his MO.
[2:52:14.180 --> 2:52:17.900]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:52:17.900 --> 2:52:22.460]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:52:22.460 --> 2:52:25.060]  networks inside the United States.
[2:52:25.060 --> 2:52:29.500]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:52:29.500 --> 2:52:31.700]  in and on the US.
[2:52:31.700 --> 2:52:35.340]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:35.340 --> 2:52:40.860]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:40.860 --> 2:52:44.980]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[2:52:44.980 --> 2:52:45.980]  much more.

[2:54:15.420 --> 2:54:17.420]  I am Jason Burma subbing in for Alex.
[2:54:17.420 --> 2:54:18.940]  Alex just popped in.
[2:54:18.940 --> 2:54:23.460]  We are in the final segment with Info Wars freelance reporter Shane Geiger and Shane.
[2:54:23.460 --> 2:54:27.820]  I really hope that you write an editorial, not only about this subject, but about your
[2:54:27.820 --> 2:54:28.820]  experience.
[2:54:28.820 --> 2:54:33.740]  I mean, literally trying to get no independent media there by announcing it a couple days
[2:54:33.740 --> 2:54:34.740]  over.
[2:54:34.740 --> 2:54:35.740]  It doesn't stop you.
[2:54:35.740 --> 2:54:36.740]  You still get on a plane.
[2:54:36.740 --> 2:54:37.740]  They still want you to submit your question.
[2:54:37.740 --> 2:54:38.740]  It doesn't stop you.
[2:54:38.740 --> 2:54:39.740]  You submit your question.
[2:54:39.740 --> 2:54:40.740]  You get in there.
[2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:41.740]  You get to ask your question.
[2:54:41.740 --> 2:54:42.740]  They turn off the lights.
[2:54:42.740 --> 2:54:45.740]  It still doesn't stop you from getting some mainstream coverage.
[2:54:45.740 --> 2:54:48.580]  So I think that you have a very unique perspective.
[2:54:48.580 --> 2:54:52.900]  We want to thank you from all of our hearts over here at infowars.com for doing what you're
[2:54:52.900 --> 2:54:53.900]  doing.
[2:54:53.900 --> 2:54:57.420]  In the next five minutes, why don't you just give me a wrap up of the whole experience.
[2:54:57.420 --> 2:55:00.420]  Well, gosh, I'm flattered.
[2:55:00.420 --> 2:55:02.420]  Thanks so much.
[2:55:02.420 --> 2:55:05.540]  I do have more to say on this.
[2:55:05.540 --> 2:55:08.060]  I wish I had your video editing skills.
[2:55:08.060 --> 2:55:11.900]  I really have some things to say, just kind of bursting.
[2:55:11.900 --> 2:55:14.900]  I talk about this with people all the time.
[2:55:14.900 --> 2:55:19.700]  I think it's really important for people to realize that 9-11 is really not the past.
[2:55:19.700 --> 2:55:22.380]  9-11 is what created.
[2:55:22.380 --> 2:55:28.340]  What we have today, with the passing of the Patriot Act, the Military Commission Act,
[2:55:28.340 --> 2:55:29.340]  all these sorts of things.
[2:55:29.340 --> 2:55:33.620]  So I think I really love what Alex does with, gosh, I love Terror Storm.
[2:55:33.620 --> 2:55:34.860]  Great film.
[2:55:34.860 --> 2:55:38.660]  And I think it's important for people to see the historical context.
[2:55:38.660 --> 2:55:46.100]  I think it's who of us really wants war with Iran and Russia, especially not nuclear war.
[2:55:46.100 --> 2:55:48.980]  Not anybody who has any sanity left in their brain.
[2:55:48.980 --> 2:55:49.980]  Exactly.
[2:55:49.980 --> 2:55:50.980]  Right.
[2:55:50.980 --> 2:55:56.660]  I mean, the people that want this, they're like these rats that have some virus or something
[2:55:56.660 --> 2:55:57.660]  in their brains.
[2:55:57.660 --> 2:55:58.660]  They want to be attacked.
[2:55:58.660 --> 2:56:03.740]  Well, they're so far removed from the quote-unquote slave class because they truly do believe
[2:56:03.740 --> 2:56:08.900]  that they are better than us, that we are chattel to be willed to their desire.
[2:56:08.900 --> 2:56:12.740]  And they're the ones that are trying to kick off World War III.
[2:56:12.740 --> 2:56:17.020]  They're the ones that have used 9-11 as this pretext to end America.
[2:56:17.020 --> 2:56:18.020]  And you're right.
[2:56:18.020 --> 2:56:19.020]  It is an ancient history.
[2:56:19.020 --> 2:56:23.980]  Our entire foreign and domestic policy right now in this country is based on the events
[2:56:23.980 --> 2:56:27.820]  of 9-11 and the way that the government and the mainstream media told us it happened.
[2:56:27.820 --> 2:56:29.140]  It is the Patriot Acts.
[2:56:29.140 --> 2:56:31.020]  It is the Military Commission.
[2:56:31.020 --> 2:56:34.620]  It's the fact that we can't even sue the government or the private organizations that
[2:56:34.620 --> 2:56:37.020]  wiretap us illegally.
[2:56:37.020 --> 2:56:39.900]  I mean, these things are all real.
[2:56:39.900 --> 2:56:42.660]  They have progressively gotten worse in this country.
[2:56:42.660 --> 2:56:47.220]  And with privatized mercenaries, like I talked about in the first segment, we are in big,
[2:56:47.220 --> 2:56:48.220]  big trouble.
[2:56:48.220 --> 2:56:49.220]  Oh, yeah.
[2:56:49.220 --> 2:56:50.220]  Blackwater.
[2:56:50.220 --> 2:56:51.220]  Yeah.
[2:56:51.220 --> 2:56:56.900]  I really want people to realize that it's important right now to look at 9-11 truth.
[2:56:56.900 --> 2:57:02.300]  The physical evidence is my favorite starting point because there you can know there's something
[2:57:02.300 --> 2:57:04.380]  absolutely wrong here.
[2:57:04.380 --> 2:57:12.740]  And at the very end of the conference yesterday, I think if you can hear what I said in the
[2:57:12.740 --> 2:57:17.020]  webcast, I haven't actually had the time to watch it myself, but if you can hear it,
[2:57:17.020 --> 2:57:19.220]  you can see that I was not attacking anybody.
[2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:23.980]  I mean, I was saying he was making bear assertions because he was, and he had every opportunity
[2:57:23.980 --> 2:57:26.980]  to rebut me, and instead he didn't say anything.
[2:57:26.980 --> 2:57:33.420]  So at the very end of this, I was surrounded by reporters talking to me, and I talked to
[2:57:33.420 --> 2:57:40.580]  them for 10 or 15 minutes and something like that, and then I saw Dr. Sunder still standing
[2:57:40.580 --> 2:57:42.140]  in the corner talking to some people.
[2:57:42.140 --> 2:57:46.620]  So I got my video camera, and I walked over to this guy, and I started videoing him a
[2:57:46.620 --> 2:57:47.620]  bit.
[2:57:47.620 --> 2:57:52.140]  I kind of went there just to see what these creeps really look like up front in person.
[2:57:52.140 --> 2:57:54.540]  I wanted to see what it looks like.
[2:57:54.540 --> 2:57:55.540]  Feel the evil.
[2:57:55.540 --> 2:57:56.540]  Yeah, I wanted to see.
[2:57:56.540 --> 2:58:02.780]  I mean, this is kind of a cool thing, and this is a work of art from the perspective
[2:58:02.780 --> 2:58:07.340]  of the evil people that did this kind of stuff, and that are taking part in the cover-up.
[2:58:07.340 --> 2:58:09.740]  So I just thought this is going to be very interesting.
[2:58:09.740 --> 2:58:12.460]  The Machiavellian masterpiece for those guys.
[2:58:12.460 --> 2:58:13.460]  Yeah, Machiavellian.
[2:58:13.460 --> 2:58:14.460]  Exactly.
[2:58:14.460 --> 2:58:15.460]  Beautiful.
[2:58:15.460 --> 2:58:21.380]  So I went over there, I got some video of this guy, and eventually it was a positive
[2:58:21.380 --> 2:58:22.380]  power.
[2:58:22.380 --> 2:58:23.380]  We need you to post that video.
[2:58:23.380 --> 2:58:25.180]  Send it to Aaron at infowars.com.
[2:58:25.180 --> 2:58:26.780]  I want to thank you again, Shane.
[2:58:26.780 --> 2:58:30.740]  We need more people like this guy that are willing to get a press pass.
[2:58:30.740 --> 2:58:32.220]  Ask an intelligent question.
[2:58:32.220 --> 2:58:33.580]  Be a part of the press.
[2:58:33.580 --> 2:58:35.660]  It's infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[2:58:35.660 --> 2:58:43.140]  Remember, fabled enemies, September 1st.
[2:58:43.140 --> 2:58:51.620]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.620 --> 2:58:53.580]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:58:53.580 --> 2:58:58.100]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[2:58:58.100 --> 2:58:59.620]  hour there is hope.
[2:58:59.620 --> 2:59:02.420]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:59:02.420 --> 2:59:06.900]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[2:59:06.900 --> 2:59:08.420]  World Order master plan.
[2:59:08.420 --> 2:59:12.660]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:59:12.660 --> 2:59:18.060]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[2:59:50.980 --> 2:59:54.220]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[2:59:54.220 --> 2:59:59.940]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:59:59.940 --> 3:00:12.060]  All right, folks, we are strapped in over at Prisonplanet.tv with a live video feed.
[3:00:12.060 --> 3:00:19.220]  You can see my little ugly mug before I get braces next week, I guess, and a lot of other
[3:00:19.220 --> 3:00:20.220]  great stuff.
[3:00:20.220 --> 3:00:21.220]  Prisonplanet.tv, it's great.

[3:00:27.740 --> 3:00:29.780]  video camera right now.
[3:00:29.780 --> 3:00:35.780]  Joining us for the next half hour is the international forecaster.com's own Bob Chapman.
[3:00:35.780 --> 3:00:40.620]  Oh, Alex, I love it when he stops by.
[3:00:40.620 --> 3:00:46.260]  And really, I want to get his take on global events from Georgia to Russia to even this
[3:00:46.260 --> 3:00:48.980]  new NIST report on WTC7.
[3:00:48.980 --> 3:00:49.980]  Thanks for joining us, Bob.
[3:00:49.980 --> 3:00:52.260]  Well, thank you for having me again.
[3:00:52.260 --> 3:00:56.420]  Well, it's always a pleasure, and you've become quite a regular on the show because you have
[3:00:56.420 --> 3:00:58.700]  such great analysis.
[3:00:58.700 --> 3:01:03.860]  I really want to get your take on, you know, the last week's activities with Georgia and
[3:01:03.860 --> 3:01:04.860]  Russia.
[3:01:04.860 --> 3:01:07.500]  I mean, the mainstream media is still saying, you know, Russia attacked Georgia.
[3:01:07.500 --> 3:01:08.500]  They're the aggressors.
[3:01:08.500 --> 3:01:09.980]  The bear is back.
[3:01:09.980 --> 3:01:14.700]  Meanwhile, there's been a slight de-escalation in the fighting over there.
[3:01:14.700 --> 3:01:16.900]  Where do you think this is all headed, Bob?
[3:01:16.900 --> 3:01:24.780]  Well, first of all, Georgia, I should say the United States and Israel were the attackers.
[3:01:24.780 --> 3:01:29.380]  And when Russian forces were brought in, they ran.
[3:01:29.380 --> 3:01:34.260]  I don't know about the Americans in the Israeli, but I know the Georgians ran.
[3:01:34.260 --> 3:01:35.740]  And so they invaded.
[3:01:35.740 --> 3:01:39.060]  They invaded South Ossetia.
[3:01:39.060 --> 3:01:40.300]  There's no doubt about it.
[3:01:40.300 --> 3:01:44.940]  A little 12-year-old American girl went on Fox and said, hey, we were in South Ossetia.
[3:01:44.940 --> 3:01:46.460]  Georgia attacked us.
[3:01:46.460 --> 3:01:51.020]  It's pretty much admitted in a lot of these mainstream articles, but it's during the bottom
[3:01:51.020 --> 3:01:56.380]  or the middle of the article, and then they just blatantly say that Russia is the aggressor,
[3:01:56.380 --> 3:01:57.380]  no matter what.
[3:01:57.380 --> 3:01:59.220]  Yeah, you're right.
[3:01:59.220 --> 3:02:04.780]  And that's unfortunate, but in a way, it's fortunate in as much as the public knows different
[3:02:04.780 --> 3:02:08.140]  and all they're doing is losing more credibility.
[3:02:08.140 --> 3:02:09.540]  The question is where we're going.
[3:02:09.540 --> 3:02:13.340]  Well, first of all, this is going to put a dent in NATO.
[3:02:13.340 --> 3:02:19.900]  I don't think that Georgia is going to be an immediate candidate for NATO.
[3:02:19.900 --> 3:02:29.180]  I think NATO has lost a lot of credibility by standing by and allowing this to happen.
[3:02:29.180 --> 3:02:36.660]  The Russians were peacekeepers, and it was blatant invasion what went on.
[3:02:36.660 --> 3:02:43.540]  I mean, I can't think of what they were thinking of in Washington and Tel Aviv, never mind
[3:02:43.540 --> 3:02:44.900]  in Georgia.
[3:02:44.900 --> 3:02:53.500]  And so I think other nations in the area are going to be more reluctant to deal with the
[3:02:53.500 --> 3:02:58.740]  United States, NATO, Israel, Georgia, et cetera.
[3:02:58.740 --> 3:03:03.060]  And so Russia is going to make big inroads.
[3:03:03.060 --> 3:03:14.580]  Last Saturday, I can't think of the name of the country, but Turkmenistan signed a deal
[3:03:14.580 --> 3:03:20.700]  with Russia to send their natural gas-virusian pipelines.
[3:03:20.700 --> 3:03:26.940]  That was the gas that we'll call it the American consortium, wanted to send through Georgia
[3:03:26.940 --> 3:03:33.460]  south to Turkey, Seyon, and then on to Haifa.
[3:03:33.460 --> 3:03:39.460]  And so the second pipeline for gas is kind of out of the question now.
[3:03:39.460 --> 3:03:46.580]  Now I understand that Kyrgyzstan wants to divert their oil from the way that they're
[3:03:46.580 --> 3:03:50.140]  shipping it through Russian pipelines as well.
[3:03:50.140 --> 3:03:55.300]  And so that's oil that will not be coming down through the Caspian Basin that could
[3:03:55.300 --> 3:03:57.660]  have been eligible to the other pipeline.
[3:03:57.660 --> 3:04:01.460]  Well, does that affect the price here in America?
[3:04:01.460 --> 3:04:03.100]  You do believe it's going to affect the price here.
[3:04:03.100 --> 3:04:06.860]  Well, I want to get your take on that and a lot more on the other side.
[3:04:06.860 --> 3:04:13.300]  When folks fabled enemies drops at PrisonPlanet.tv first on August 31st and the DVD ship out

[3:04:40.540 --> 3:04:43.020]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[3:04:43.020 --> 3:04:47.700]  Tebow Tech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family.

[3:05:29.540 --> 3:05:34.820]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:05:34.820 --> 3:05:36.340]  against this country.
[3:05:36.340 --> 3:05:40.540]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:05:40.540 --> 3:05:41.540]  bin Laden.
[3:05:41.540 --> 3:05:42.540]  He sees his M.O.
[3:05:42.540 --> 3:05:43.540]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:05:43.540 --> 3:05:45.540]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:05:45.540 --> 3:05:50.340]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:05:50.340 --> 3:05:52.900]  networks inside the United States.
[3:05:52.900 --> 3:05:56.820]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[3:05:56.820 --> 3:05:59.580]  spying in and on the U.S.
[3:05:59.580 --> 3:06:03.140]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:03.140 --> 3:06:08.700]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:06:08.700 --> 3:06:12.500]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[3:06:12.500 --> 3:06:13.900]  much, much more.
[3:06:13.900 --> 3:06:14.900]  Fabled enemies.
[3:06:14.900 --> 3:06:19.820]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of
[3:06:19.820 --> 3:06:21.820]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:06:21.820 --> 3:06:29.820]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:06:29.820 --> 3:06:33.740]  Imagine if I had come to you a couple of years ago and said to you, hey, gasoline prices
[3:06:33.740 --> 3:06:38.300]  are going to jump to $5 a gallon, and I know a way that we can store several hundred gallons
[3:06:38.300 --> 3:06:43.740]  for you, a year or two supply of gasoline, buy it today at $2 a gallon, and when it goes
[3:06:43.740 --> 3:06:45.900]  to $5 a gallon, you'll be way ahead of the game.
[3:06:45.900 --> 3:06:48.620]  And you probably, at the time, would have said to me, you're nuts, get away, you're
[3:06:48.620 --> 3:06:51.740]  crazy little dick, go bye-bye, and okay, fine.
[3:06:51.740 --> 3:06:55.660]  Now I'm telling you, what's happened to gasoline is happening to food.
[3:06:55.660 --> 3:07:01.380]  Your grocery bill is going to skyrocket, and you can put bulk foods away at less than half
[3:07:01.380 --> 3:07:05.020]  the price of your regular grocery bill, and by tomorrow standards, that could be at less
[3:07:05.020 --> 3:07:07.860]  than fourth of the price, or eighth of the price, or sixteenth of the price.
[3:07:07.860 --> 3:07:10.260]  Hello, or do you have an investor's brain or not?
[3:07:10.260 --> 3:07:11.260]  Pay attention.
[3:07:11.260 --> 3:07:16.740]  Storeable foods, bulk foods, from the J. Michael Stevens Company, eatfoodsdirect.com.
[3:07:16.740 --> 3:07:21.220]  Go there now, eatfoodsdirect.com, get a year or two's worth of bulk foods while they still
[3:07:21.220 --> 3:07:23.340]  are available, and they won't be much longer.
[3:07:23.340 --> 3:07:29.140]  Or call them at 800-409-5633, that's 800-409-5633.
[3:07:29.140 --> 3:07:35.060]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[3:07:35.060 --> 3:07:38.660]  a war on for your mind.
[3:07:38.660 --> 3:07:46.420]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back at the Alex Jones Show, I am Jason Bermas
[3:07:46.420 --> 3:07:47.420]  sitting in.
[3:07:47.420 --> 3:07:52.100]  It's one last week, I'll be here until next Thursday, and then it's back to New York for
[3:07:52.100 --> 3:07:53.100]  me.
[3:07:53.100 --> 3:07:58.220]  We're going to be covering the DNC with live feeds over at infowars.com, of Alex Jones
[3:07:58.220 --> 3:08:01.860]  and others on the InfoWars team, we're really looking forward to it, but right now we're
[3:08:01.860 --> 3:08:08.940]  talking to Bob Chapman of theInternationalForecaster.com, and we were talking about all these pipelines
[3:08:08.940 --> 3:08:12.620]  and how America seems to be losing control of these pipelines, and you think that this
[3:08:12.620 --> 3:08:15.900]  is going to affect the price of gas in this country?
[3:08:15.900 --> 3:08:27.420]  No, I really don't, there's multiple sources, it'll affect the ability of oil companies
[3:08:27.420 --> 3:08:35.780]  from the Netherlands, England, France, and the United States from getting more supply,
[3:08:35.780 --> 3:08:41.660]  and that could be an issue with all the problems that are going on in Nigeria, and the diminishing
[3:08:41.660 --> 3:08:50.980]  exports of oil from Mexico, but I don't think at this point all of that is a factor in the
[3:08:50.980 --> 3:08:59.740]  big picture of oil, and so I discount that, oil, it's the fundamentals more than anything
[3:08:59.740 --> 3:09:06.420]  else, yes, there has been excessive speculation, and that's been taken care of by the market
[3:09:06.420 --> 3:09:13.740]  itself, and part of that was the inability of speculators to continue to be able to
[3:09:13.740 --> 3:09:18.820]  borrow as much money as they'd like to, and that's called the deleveraging process, and
[3:09:18.820 --> 3:09:24.540]  it was natural that a correction should have taken place, unfortunately, they took gold
[3:09:24.540 --> 3:09:31.660]  and silver down with them, although they have rallied back somewhat as have the commodities,
[3:09:31.660 --> 3:09:38.460]  but I think both groups are looking for a bottom in here, and I had previously said
[3:09:38.460 --> 3:09:44.540]  I expected somewhere between 1 and 120 on oil as a support level, and I think that's
[3:09:44.540 --> 3:09:46.780]  what we're getting.
[3:09:46.780 --> 3:09:55.900]  To go on with the situation with Russia and others, I think Russia was underestimated,
[3:09:55.900 --> 3:10:01.980]  I don't think that the big new Brzezinski thought that Russia would move on Georgia,
[3:10:01.980 --> 3:10:09.940]  which they did, and they are showing no fear, if you may, and I think the relationship with
[3:10:09.940 --> 3:10:17.260]  NATO is over, I think the Israelis are going to suffer from this in as much as the Russians
[3:10:17.260 --> 3:10:24.340]  were very cooperative in helping them try to discern what was going on in a nuclear
[3:10:24.340 --> 3:10:31.980]  basis with Iran, and that will all be shut down, so Israel isn't going to have that
[3:10:31.980 --> 3:10:38.900]  opportunity in the future because of their actions and the aggression that occurred
[3:10:38.900 --> 3:10:43.300]  by Georgia, they had been training and supplying weapons along with the United States for the
[3:10:43.300 --> 3:10:50.100]  last six years, and their efforts didn't turn out too well because they had as good
[3:10:50.100 --> 3:10:55.220]  as equipment in Georgia, if not better than what the Russians had.
[3:10:55.220 --> 3:10:59.780]  I think that foreign policy is going to change tremendously.
[3:10:59.780 --> 3:11:06.820]  I think Europe has seen that the U.S. has gone off with Israel and what I would call
[3:11:06.820 --> 3:11:12.660]  another cockamamie idea, and they made fools out of themselves again, and Europe's saying,
[3:11:12.660 --> 3:11:18.380]  hey, you know, these guys supply one-third of our gas to Western Europe.
[3:11:18.380 --> 3:11:25.420]  I don't think we ought to go along with these insane ideas anymore, and so I think America
[3:11:25.420 --> 3:11:32.340]  has lost great credence with the Western nations in Europe, and Europe's concerned, and they
[3:11:32.340 --> 3:11:38.300]  should be not only because of the gas situation, but Russia is the neighbor, and if things
[3:11:38.300 --> 3:11:41.100]  get nasty, they're going to get hit first.
[3:11:41.100 --> 3:11:47.860]  I think this could lead to the breakup of NATO as well, and maybe something would replace
[3:11:47.860 --> 3:11:55.620]  it, but I think NATO is pretty much done for, and I don't think most people have seen that
[3:11:55.620 --> 3:11:56.620]  yet.
[3:11:56.620 --> 3:11:57.860]  So you think NATO is going to break up?
[3:11:57.860 --> 3:11:58.860]  Why?
[3:11:58.860 --> 3:12:02.340]  Because it's surrounding Russia on the U.S.'s behalf right now, and now we have this conflict.
[3:12:02.340 --> 3:12:07.860]  I mean, do you see a restructuring of that Russian region altogether, South Ossetia,
[3:12:07.860 --> 3:12:08.860]  Georgia?
[3:12:08.860 --> 3:12:10.860]  Well, that could happen.
[3:12:10.860 --> 3:12:17.660]  It all depends on how hard the U.S. pushes, like if in the Ukraine it's the best support.
[3:12:17.660 --> 3:12:26.420]  If they decide, Ukraine decides to put some heat on Russian shipping, which they have
[3:12:26.420 --> 3:12:30.980]  a 17-year lease left, then Russia's just going to take them over.
[3:12:30.980 --> 3:12:37.500]  They're not going to fool around with them, and any other...
[3:12:37.500 --> 3:12:38.500]  And you don't think someone like NATO would get involved?
[3:12:38.500 --> 3:12:42.340] ... in the area that causes problems, they're going to move against them.
[3:12:42.340 --> 3:12:44.140]  Well, I mean, I'm talking about...
[3:12:44.140 --> 3:12:51.340]  The U.S. and with the help of these NGOs, which is these fronts by George Soros, those
[3:12:51.340 --> 3:12:56.180]  are non-governmental organizations, they've really corrupted the political system in many
[3:12:56.180 --> 3:13:05.500]  of those former Soviet countries, and they, the Soros and the CIA, etc., MI6 have been
[3:13:05.500 --> 3:13:11.660]  able to essentially appoint their own people to run those governments.
[3:13:11.660 --> 3:13:16.500]  And that's going to change because I don't think that the people in Ukraine are going
[3:13:16.500 --> 3:13:20.980]  to want to tangle with the Russians, nor in any other Baltic state.
[3:13:20.980 --> 3:13:24.460]  And so I think the Americans have lost credibility.
[3:13:24.460 --> 3:13:26.260]  I think NATO will break up.
[3:13:26.260 --> 3:13:30.940]  I think the Americans are going to be asked to leave Germany.
[3:13:30.940 --> 3:13:35.140]  And so there's a lot of things going to happen through the stupidity of these people.
[3:13:35.140 --> 3:13:40.100]  Well, so do you think that this is really just another indication of the decline of
[3:13:40.100 --> 3:13:41.100]  the American Empire?
[3:13:41.100 --> 3:13:45.420]  Do you really think that America is not going to go kicking and screaming and try to set
[3:13:45.420 --> 3:13:50.660]  off another attack or another conflict?
[3:13:50.660 --> 3:13:53.060]  You really think that they're just going to back off?
[3:13:53.060 --> 3:13:57.260]  Well, I think there's a good chance of another conflict.
[3:13:57.260 --> 3:14:02.340]  There's several spots, and Kosovo is one of them.
[3:14:02.340 --> 3:14:09.820]  It's a transit point for narcotics from out of Afghanistan by the CIA to Western Europe
[3:14:09.820 --> 3:14:11.740]  and the rest of the world.
[3:14:11.740 --> 3:14:16.740]  And that could be a catalyst.
[3:14:16.740 --> 3:14:24.180]  You could also have an eventual extension into Iran, but I rather doubt it.
[3:14:24.180 --> 3:14:31.740]  I think that just the winding down of what's going on in the Middle East is going to hurt
[3:14:31.740 --> 3:14:33.900]  American foreign policy.
[3:14:33.900 --> 3:14:37.260]  But I don't really look at things in that light.
[3:14:37.260 --> 3:14:42.340]  I look at them in the light of who's behind the scenes right on the show.
[3:14:42.340 --> 3:14:46.060]  And it's obvious, even though you hear all of this thunder and lightning about Barack
[3:14:46.060 --> 3:14:52.260]  Obama, the Illuminati wants Mr. McCain in there.
[3:14:52.260 --> 3:14:57.940]  And it's very important to watch out for who the vice president candidate will be and if
[3:14:57.940 --> 3:15:04.700]  they are elected, Mr. McCain is an elderly man, like myself, I might add.
[3:15:04.700 --> 3:15:10.940]  And he might be asked to step down, which he would, for this vice presidential candidate.
[3:15:10.940 --> 3:15:17.020]  So it's very important who this candidate is, whether they can control that candidate
[3:15:17.020 --> 3:15:22.180]  or not, or whether they have to go the assassination route like they do with John Kennedy and
[3:15:22.180 --> 3:15:23.580]  others.
[3:15:23.580 --> 3:15:31.940]  And so it's very complex, and it's hard to reach out into the future and come up with
[3:15:31.940 --> 3:15:37.020]  solutions or answers because there's so many things that could happen.
[3:15:37.020 --> 3:15:40.140]  But they're all bad, and that's unfortunate.
[3:15:40.140 --> 3:15:48.100]  And so I see Russia becoming a greater industrial, economic, and financial power.
[3:15:48.100 --> 3:15:56.020]  And they do hold a lot of U.S. government securities, probably something in the vicinity
[3:15:56.020 --> 3:16:02.380]  of about $160 or $70 billion.
[3:16:02.380 --> 3:16:08.140]  There are others like China who own more, but that's a pretty heavy hammer.
[3:16:08.140 --> 3:16:14.660]  And as you just saw, China used underage athletes, overage athletes, in the competitions
[3:16:14.660 --> 3:16:17.220]  in some of the categories.
[3:16:17.220 --> 3:16:22.900]  And quickly, the others at the competitions said, oh, no problem.
[3:16:22.900 --> 3:16:25.220]  We believe what China is telling us.
[3:16:25.220 --> 3:16:29.340]  And the real reason behind that is that the China probably told them, if you don't shut
[3:16:29.340 --> 3:16:31.780]  up, you're going to eat a lot of paper.
[3:16:31.780 --> 3:16:36.340]  And so they've got a hammer over the United States financially as well.
[3:16:36.340 --> 3:16:42.340]  And I think America's in deep trouble, and the world is for that matter.
[3:16:42.340 --> 3:16:48.900]  And the adversaries will be the BRIC nations, which China, Russia, India, Venezuela, and
[3:16:48.900 --> 3:16:49.900]  so on.
[3:16:49.900 --> 3:16:52.660]  Well, we talked about China really early in the show, and I'm glad that you shifted
[3:16:52.660 --> 3:16:53.660]  gears there.
[3:16:53.660 --> 3:16:57.180]  And I really want to get your take on where China is headed.
[3:16:57.180 --> 3:17:02.340]  I mean, we had Benjamin Fulford on in the first hour, and he was defending the military
[3:17:02.340 --> 3:17:05.900]  police state that is China, that they don't have a separation.
[3:17:05.900 --> 3:17:09.460]  He was denying that they were still harvesting organs there.
[3:17:09.460 --> 3:17:12.780]  He said that they were on the verge of ending one-child policies.
[3:17:12.780 --> 3:17:18.540]  Obviously, China is being introduced to the rest of the globe through having the Olympics
[3:17:18.540 --> 3:17:20.380]  there this year.
[3:17:20.380 --> 3:17:21.380]  What is your take?
[3:17:21.380 --> 3:17:23.980]  Are the Chinese emerging?
[3:17:23.980 --> 3:17:24.980]  Is this it?
[3:17:24.980 --> 3:17:26.980]  Are they the next dominant power in the world?
[3:17:26.980 --> 3:17:31.620]  Could be, but they're emerging as a communist power.
[3:17:31.620 --> 3:17:34.540]  And the people who are in the party make all the money.
[3:17:34.540 --> 3:17:39.100]  And they're going to continue to do the dastardly things that they've done in the past.
[3:17:39.100 --> 3:17:44.060]  Not that those, quote, capitalists that we see on Wall Street are any better.
[3:17:44.060 --> 3:17:49.420]  But the point here is that they are what they are, and they're going to continue to harvest
[3:17:49.420 --> 3:17:59.020]  organs and have one child, and that's understandable for them, because the population is so large,
[3:17:59.020 --> 3:18:03.980]  and the ability to feed and allow them to work is difficult.
[3:18:03.980 --> 3:18:11.020]  The reason China has emerged, I think the main reason, is to bring down the economies
[3:18:11.020 --> 3:18:16.860]  of Canada and the United States and Western Europe to the level, perhaps halfway down
[3:18:16.860 --> 3:18:21.020]  to China, and China moves up halfway.
[3:18:21.020 --> 3:18:25.940]  So relegating them to a second world nation, instead of a third world nation, they ring
[3:18:25.940 --> 3:18:26.940]  us down to the wall.
[3:18:26.940 --> 3:18:30.020]  Well, it will all become second world nations, if you want to put it that way.
[3:18:30.020 --> 3:18:34.300]  But the second reason is free trade and globalization.
[3:18:34.300 --> 3:18:40.100]  All the transnational corporations will take Walmart, General Electric, particularly IBM.
[3:18:40.100 --> 3:18:48.380]  They're making a fortune on this export from China to the United States or India to the
[3:18:48.380 --> 3:18:54.860]  United States, and that's the second most important reason, and that's what's going
[3:18:54.860 --> 3:18:57.900]  on is going to continue to go on unless we stop it.
[3:18:57.900 --> 3:18:58.900]  And how do you stop it?
[3:18:58.900 --> 3:19:07.460]  You stop it through legislation implementing a reassessment of our policies in trade and
[3:19:07.460 --> 3:19:14.140]  implementing tariffs on goods and services, and that's the only way we're going to stop
[3:19:14.140 --> 3:19:15.140]  it.
[3:19:15.140 --> 3:19:16.420]  All right, we'll be back with you for one final segment.
[3:19:16.420 --> 3:19:29.700]  It's Bob Chapman of theInternationalForecaster.com, Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.com, PrismPlanet.tv.
[3:19:29.700 --> 3:19:33.900]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth
[3:19:33.900 --> 3:19:36.340]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[3:19:36.340 --> 3:19:41.460]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[3:19:41.460 --> 3:19:44.460]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:19:44.460 --> 3:19:48.780]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[3:19:48.780 --> 3:19:52.700]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[3:19:52.700 --> 3:19:56.460]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[3:19:56.460 --> 3:19:57.860]  from Jekyll Island.
[3:19:57.860 --> 3:20:01.860]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[3:20:01.860 --> 3:20:02.860]  power.
[3:20:02.860 --> 3:20:06.740]  It's a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[3:20:06.740 --> 3:20:08.260]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[3:20:29.340 --> 3:20:34.940]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grand Tierra
[3:20:34.940 --> 3:20:38.460]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:20:38.460 --> 3:20:43.740]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[3:20:43.740 --> 3:20:45.340]  to tell their story.
[3:20:45.340 --> 3:20:54.340]  Women, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:20:54.340 --> 3:20:59.100]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[3:20:59.100 --> 3:21:01.380]  take action against their global masters.
[3:21:01.380 --> 3:21:04.540]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:21:04.540 --> 3:21:10.340]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:21:10.340 --> 3:21:13.860]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[3:21:22.340 --> 3:21:26.020]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[3:21:26.020 --> 3:21:28.700]  and bring in martial law.
[3:21:28.700 --> 3:21:33.660]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.

[3:22:09.860 --> 3:22:10.860]  Okay.
[3:22:10.860 --> 3:22:11.860]  All right, thanks, man.
[3:22:11.860 --> 3:22:12.860]  Just assume it's ready.
[3:22:12.860 --> 3:22:13.860]  Okay, thanks, man.
[3:22:13.860 --> 3:22:14.860]  Okay.
[3:22:14.860 --> 3:22:15.860]  Thanks.
[3:22:15.860 --> 3:22:19.460]  But our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.

[3:23:45.540 --> 3:23:46.540]  Alright folks, we're back.
[3:23:46.540 --> 3:23:49.060]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[3:23:49.060 --> 3:23:50.540]  I am Jason Bermas.
[3:23:50.540 --> 3:23:55.580]  Before we go back to Bob Chapman, I want to play a little trailer, the second trailer
[3:23:55.580 --> 3:23:56.580]  from Fable Enemies.
[3:23:56.580 --> 3:24:01.380]  Remember folks, it comes out to PrismPlanet.tv, subscribers in super high quality on August
[3:24:01.380 --> 3:24:04.460]  31st, and we will be shipping DVDs the next day.
[3:24:04.460 --> 3:24:08.580]  If you want to join us in New York City on September 10th, we're going to be showing
[3:24:08.580 --> 3:24:13.100]  both Truth Rising, Alex's film, and my film, Fable Enemies, and we'll both be there to
[3:24:13.100 --> 3:24:14.100]  speak.
[3:24:14.100 --> 3:24:16.100]  So without further ado, let's play the clip.
[3:24:16.100 --> 3:24:21.740]  Fox News has learned that some American terrorism investigators fear certain suspects in the
[3:24:21.740 --> 3:24:26.260]  September 11 attacks may have managed to stay ahead of them.
[3:24:26.260 --> 3:24:30.140]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[3:24:30.140 --> 3:24:32.780]  spying in and on the U.S.
[3:24:32.780 --> 3:24:37.260]  Whether it's because they are in intelligence services or what they were doing, I will defer
[3:24:37.260 --> 3:24:39.460]  to the Department of Justice and the FBI.
[3:24:39.460 --> 3:24:45.020]  That there was a report on the George Washington Bridge that there had been a van stopped there
[3:24:45.020 --> 3:24:46.260]  that had explosives.
[3:24:46.260 --> 3:24:52.380]  Now there's suspects who trip, of course, the van is unexploded.
[3:24:52.380 --> 3:24:59.020]  Amdox Limited, an Israeli-based private telecommunications company, it is virtually impossible to make
[3:24:59.020 --> 3:25:03.620]  a call on normal phones without generating an Amdox record of it.
[3:25:03.620 --> 3:25:09.100]  It quickly unraveled to be the largest foreign spying ever uncovered inside the United States,
[3:25:09.100 --> 3:25:10.600]  the largest.
[3:25:10.600 --> 3:25:16.620]  They say they quote, targeted and penetrated military bases, the DEA, FBI, and dozens of
[3:25:16.620 --> 3:25:18.340]  other government facilities.
[3:25:18.340 --> 3:25:22.140]  There's one big elephant in the living room.
[3:25:22.140 --> 3:25:27.340]  It is the relationship between the United States of America and the state of Israel.
[3:25:27.340 --> 3:25:31.300]  What about this question of advanced knowledge of what was going to happen on 9-11?
[3:25:31.300 --> 3:25:33.500]  Well, it's very explosive information, obviously.
[3:25:33.500 --> 3:25:37.180]  A bigger question, they say, is how could they not have known?
[3:25:37.180 --> 3:25:39.060]  All right, folks.
[3:25:39.060 --> 3:25:40.060]  There it is.
[3:25:40.060 --> 3:25:45.540]  And now jumping back to Bob Chapman of theInternationalForecaster.com, Bob, why don't you tell people
[3:25:45.540 --> 3:25:48.100]  how they can get your newsletter and all your information?
[3:25:48.100 --> 3:25:52.860]  And really, in the next four minutes, sum up what the average citizen can do to prepare
[3:25:52.860 --> 3:25:54.620]  for these coming events.
[3:25:54.620 --> 3:26:03.220]  Well, International Forecaster is about business finance, economics, and social political issues.
[3:26:03.220 --> 3:26:08.900]  We publish on email on Wednesdays and Saturdays, around 30 pages each time.
[3:26:08.900 --> 3:26:12.140]  And we also have a hard copy that goes out twice a month as well.

[3:26:20.620 --> 3:26:25.580]  theinternationalforecer.com.

[3:26:31.580 --> 3:26:38.620]  yahoo.com, international, underscore, forecaster, at yahoo.com.

[3:26:50.060 --> 3:26:54.780]  What should we be doing in what respect, financially?
[3:26:54.780 --> 3:26:58.660]  Just to prepare, I mean, not only financially, but I know that we support storeable foods
[3:26:58.660 --> 3:26:59.660]  on this show.
[3:26:59.660 --> 3:27:01.660]  It just seems like the price of everything is skyrocketing.
[3:27:01.660 --> 3:27:02.660]  I got you.
[3:27:02.660 --> 3:27:03.660]  Yeah.
[3:27:03.660 --> 3:27:04.660]  First of all, I want to say one last thing.
[3:27:04.660 --> 3:27:11.900]  The reason for what you saw in Georgia was a distraction, and their distraction was because
[3:27:11.900 --> 3:27:16.900]  the economic and financial condition in the Western world is dreadful, and they needed
[3:27:16.900 --> 3:27:22.460]  to do something, just like they did with Iraq when they did it, to get people's minds off
[3:27:22.460 --> 3:27:27.820]  watching their budget, their inflation, their lack of buying power, et cetera, and get it
[3:27:27.820 --> 3:27:30.660]  focused over in Georgia and it blew up in their face.
[3:27:30.660 --> 3:27:32.940]  So I just wanted to fit that in.
[3:27:32.940 --> 3:27:39.100]  I am a great believer and have been for many years of having dehydrated, freeze-dried foods
[3:27:39.100 --> 3:27:45.500]  filled to the clean water, a method to defend your family, and I think that's very, very
[3:27:45.500 --> 3:27:46.500]  important.
[3:27:46.500 --> 3:27:53.660]  It's very important to get rid of your credit card debt, in particular, of all debt, revolving
[3:27:53.660 --> 3:27:59.780]  debt, your automobile debt if possible, and then if you have money left over after having
[3:27:59.780 --> 3:28:05.300]  done that, then you can think about investing in gold and silver-related assets.
[3:28:05.300 --> 3:28:07.540]  And that's my take on it.
[3:28:07.540 --> 3:28:10.220]  I am very suspect of the banking system.
[3:28:10.220 --> 3:28:13.420]  I think there's going to be lots and lots of problems.
[3:28:13.420 --> 3:28:16.260]  We have three sites that we recommend.
[3:28:16.260 --> 3:28:21.740]  If you email us, we'll send you the site so you can look into the condition of the bank
[3:28:21.740 --> 3:28:26.740]  that you're in, and that's very helpful for people.
[3:28:26.740 --> 3:28:35.500]  And I think it's a very basic insurance policy to do these things, and if everything goes
[3:28:35.500 --> 3:28:41.300]  okay, then that's fine, and you can eat the food and probably gain a lot of weight.
[3:28:41.300 --> 3:28:48.340]  Yeah, absolutely, and you're only going to save yourself some time and some heartache.
[3:28:48.340 --> 3:28:53.340]  I mean, obviously, we are a nation that is just totally and completely dependent on debt,
[3:28:53.340 --> 3:28:57.820]  and the way to protect yourself is to get yourself out of that debt before these terrible
[3:28:57.820 --> 3:28:59.060]  things do occur.
[3:28:59.060 --> 3:29:03.700]  Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com, thank you so much for joining us.
[3:29:03.700 --> 3:29:07.940]  We're going to have Richard Gage in the next and final half hour.
[3:29:07.940 --> 3:29:08.940]  It is The Alex Jones Show.
[3:29:08.940 --> 3:29:09.940]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[3:29:09.940 --> 3:29:10.940]  I'm going to be here through Thursday.
[3:29:10.940 --> 3:29:19.820]  Remember, fabledenemiesatinfowars.com right now.
[3:29:19.820 --> 3:29:23.540]  Here on the March, The Empire's on the Run.
[3:29:23.540 --> 3:29:29.820]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:29.820 --> 3:29:35.020]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:29:35.020 --> 3:29:36.540]  against this country.
[3:29:36.540 --> 3:29:38.820]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:29:38.820 --> 3:29:40.820]  But who is the enemy?
[3:29:40.820 --> 3:29:41.820]  Bin Laden.
[3:29:41.820 --> 3:29:42.820]  This is his MO.
[3:29:42.820 --> 3:29:43.820]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:29:43.820 --> 3:29:46.100]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:29:46.100 --> 3:29:50.540]  Fabledenemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:29:50.540 --> 3:29:53.140]  networks inside the United States.
[3:29:53.140 --> 3:29:57.620]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:29:57.620 --> 3:29:59.780]  in and on the U.S.
[3:29:59.780 --> 3:30:03.460]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:30:03.460 --> 3:30:08.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:30:08.940 --> 3:30:12.740]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[3:30:12.740 --> 3:30:14.100]  much, much more.
[3:30:14.100 --> 3:30:15.100]  Fabledenemies.

[3:30:21.700 --> 3:30:29.580]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[3:30:29.580 --> 3:30:33.140]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[3:30:33.140 --> 3:30:35.700]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[3:30:35.700 --> 3:30:41.580]  Tonight I have a date with a very lovely Rachel and today I gave a killer presentation in
[3:30:41.580 --> 3:30:42.580]  Sydney.
[3:30:42.580 --> 3:30:47.580]  I made a contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston online from my desk
[3:30:47.580 --> 3:30:48.580]  with WebEx.
[3:30:48.580 --> 3:30:52.220]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[3:30:52.220 --> 3:30:56.220]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from
[3:30:56.220 --> 3:31:02.340]  their desktop so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[3:31:02.340 --> 3:31:03.340]  Travel less.
[3:31:03.340 --> 3:31:08.620]  Meet online with WebEx for as little as $59 a month about the price of a tank of gas.
[3:31:08.620 --> 3:31:11.780]  You could host unlimited meetings every month from your desktop.
[3:31:11.780 --> 3:31:15.740]  WebEx from Cisco, used by more than 7 million people every month.

[3:31:28.620 --> 3:31:29.620]  for details.
[3:31:29.620 --> 3:31:30.620]  Hi there.
[3:31:30.620 --> 3:31:33.500]  I want to talk to you about a dirty word, hangover.
[3:31:33.500 --> 3:31:34.820]  I know, I know.
[3:31:34.820 --> 3:31:38.380]  As the makers of drink and mate hangover defense tablets, we hear it every day.
[3:31:38.380 --> 3:31:42.100]  Grown, respectable adults don't get hangovers.
[3:31:42.100 --> 3:31:45.740]  Hangovers are what you got in college when you had about 10 too many at the frat house
[3:31:45.740 --> 3:31:49.660]  and then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon the next day.
[3:31:49.660 --> 3:31:53.580]  These days, well sure, sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes
[3:31:53.580 --> 3:31:56.940]  you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy.
[3:31:56.940 --> 3:31:58.980]  But that's not really a hangover, is it?
[3:31:58.980 --> 3:32:02.420]  Well, call it what you want, but now you don't need to get one.
[3:32:02.420 --> 3:32:04.700]  Thanks to drink and mate hangover defense.
[3:32:04.700 --> 3:32:08.460]  Just pop one fizzy drink and mate tablet into a glass of water, just after you have
[3:32:08.460 --> 3:32:09.580]  a couple drinks.
[3:32:09.580 --> 3:32:14.580]  They taste great and the patented guava leaf extract formula works while you sleep.
[3:32:14.580 --> 3:32:18.700]  So you wake up with no headache, no queasiness, no hangover.
[3:32:18.700 --> 3:32:21.060]  Look for the green box at retailers everywhere.

[3:32:24.180 --> 3:32:25.540]  Drink and mate hangover defense.
[3:32:25.540 --> 3:32:29.740]  It's how smart, responsible people like us avoid hangovers.
[3:32:29.740 --> 3:32:33.540]  Hey Jason.
[3:32:33.540 --> 3:32:35.300]  Yes sir, we do have Richard Gage.
[3:32:35.300 --> 3:32:36.300]  Excellent.
[3:32:36.300 --> 3:32:37.300]  Okay.
[3:32:37.300 --> 3:32:51.300]  I've got to run to keep broke head and I'm mad to keep old friend.
[3:32:51.300 --> 3:33:03.300]  I've got one more silver dollar, but I just love this country stuff that Alex plays sometimes.
[3:33:03.300 --> 3:33:06.820]  I guess it's not country, it's a little classic rock.
[3:33:06.820 --> 3:33:08.580]  We are back at the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:08.580 --> 3:33:12.980]  I am Jason Bermas and joining me is one of the founders of architects and engineers for
[3:33:12.980 --> 3:33:15.060]  9-Eleven Truth, one of my friends.
[3:33:15.060 --> 3:33:20.060]  Richard Gage, he's done just an incredible amount of work to try to expose the lie that
[3:33:20.060 --> 3:33:25.340]  is 9-Eleven, especially in the field of control demolitions of one and two and seven.
[3:33:25.340 --> 3:33:30.860]  And now we have this official NIST report, which literally flies in the face of reason.
[3:33:30.860 --> 3:33:34.140]  I'm sure that you tuned into the press conference yesterday, Richard.
[3:33:34.140 --> 3:33:37.020]  Let's just get your take off it, off the bat.
[3:33:37.020 --> 3:33:42.740]  Yeah, I sure did, Jason, and it's great to hear your voice again.
[3:33:42.740 --> 3:33:52.540]  The NIST laid out the official story that we have a expansion, thermal expansion of long
[3:33:52.540 --> 3:33:59.740]  span beams that broke their connections at specifically at column 79 on a few floors leaving
[3:33:59.740 --> 3:34:03.940]  it unbrazed for three or four floors.
[3:34:03.940 --> 3:34:11.420]  And then, of course, it collapsed and then causing north-south and east-west progressive
[3:34:11.420 --> 3:34:16.420]  collapse that brought the whole thing down like a house of cards in about six and a half
[3:34:16.420 --> 3:34:17.980]  seconds.
[3:34:17.980 --> 3:34:25.660]  And that's the official story, but the 47-story skyscraper brought down to a pile of four
[3:34:25.660 --> 3:34:29.340]  stories due to normal office fires.
[3:34:29.340 --> 3:34:35.820]  No contribution by the collapsing debris from North Tower.
[3:34:35.820 --> 3:34:41.020]  No contribution much at all from diesel fuel fires.
[3:34:41.020 --> 3:34:46.020]  These are normal office fires, which, for the first time in history, have brought down
[3:34:46.020 --> 3:34:51.140]  a skyscraper due to fire never before.
[3:34:51.140 --> 3:34:56.580]  Even though we've had longer-lasting, much larger, and much hotter fires, we haven't
[3:34:56.580 --> 3:35:03.060]  lost one skyscraper, and all of a sudden this one is completely leveled symmetrically, smoothly
[3:35:03.060 --> 3:35:12.580]  with a sudden onset, not characteristic at all to destruction by fire, which is a gradual
[3:35:12.580 --> 3:35:19.260]  process, asymmetrical collapses when they occur in wood frame buildings.
[3:35:19.260 --> 3:35:26.860]  And very characteristic of the classic, explosive, controlled demolition.
[3:35:26.860 --> 3:35:27.860]  Absolutely.
[3:35:27.860 --> 3:35:34.580]  And I just want to head back to two points that they now had to admit that the diesel
[3:35:34.580 --> 3:35:39.940]  fuel tanks, which was the initial, I guess, explanation on the news that these fuel tanks
[3:35:39.940 --> 3:35:42.020]  ignited, they exploded, and that's what brought down.
[3:35:42.020 --> 3:35:43.940]  No way that had anything to do with it.
[3:35:43.940 --> 3:35:48.620]  Then they go on popular mechanics's little hit piece before they wrote their book and
[3:35:48.620 --> 3:35:53.060]  said that they had photographs and video that no one else had, and it showed that 25%
[3:35:53.060 --> 3:35:56.900]  of the building was scooped out up to 10 stories of this skyscraper.
[3:35:56.900 --> 3:36:01.660]  Now they've recanted that statement and now said that the damage caused by World Trade
[3:36:01.660 --> 3:36:06.500]  Center 1 and 2 had little to no significance on this building actually falling.
[3:36:06.500 --> 3:36:10.660]  Now they also admit, which just shocks me that more people aren't picking up, they didn't
[3:36:10.660 --> 3:36:15.220]  have any debris from World Trade Center Building 7 to actually study, and this was all done
[3:36:15.220 --> 3:36:16.780]  with computer models.
[3:36:16.780 --> 3:36:21.220]  But from what I've seen of the computer models, it's not like they put in a steel beam with
[3:36:21.220 --> 3:36:23.060]  the physical properties of a steel beam.
[3:36:23.060 --> 3:36:28.820]  It looks more like, to me, they built a wireframe based on the blueprints of the building and
[3:36:28.820 --> 3:36:32.620]  then just animated it in a way that it would support their hypothesis.
[3:36:32.620 --> 3:36:35.020]  That's what it should look like.
[3:36:35.020 --> 3:36:45.380]  And the animation that they showed us in the press conference yesterday was not even complete.
[3:36:45.380 --> 3:36:51.420]  They just showed kind of the initiation of collapse around column 79.
[3:36:51.420 --> 3:36:53.580]  They didn't show, and perhaps they couldn't show.
[3:36:53.580 --> 3:36:54.580]  I don't know.
[3:36:54.580 --> 3:36:55.580]  The whole building collapsing.
[3:36:55.580 --> 3:37:01.180]  It's interesting that, once again, we have a stopping at the initiation of collapse like
[3:37:01.180 --> 3:37:03.340]  they did for the Twin Towers.
[3:37:03.340 --> 3:37:11.100]  They said, admitted later, they have no explanation in the Twin Towers how the progressive collapse
[3:37:11.100 --> 3:37:12.100]  happened.
[3:37:12.100 --> 3:37:15.620]  They can't explain the whole collapse.
[3:37:15.620 --> 3:37:19.780]  No, instead, they invented a new term called global collapse, which they used for the first
[3:37:19.780 --> 3:37:25.460]  time ever in that 10,000-page NIST report on 1 and 2, and now have used again in this
[3:37:25.460 --> 3:37:28.260]  new report on World Trade Center Building 7.
[3:37:28.260 --> 3:37:29.260]  Yes.
[3:37:29.260 --> 3:37:35.460]  And they didn't even mention that the building came down at virtually freefall speed.
[3:37:35.460 --> 3:37:42.060]  In other words, there's 40,000 tons of structural steel in this building designed to resist
[3:37:42.060 --> 3:37:44.820]  its load for the life of the building.
[3:37:44.820 --> 3:37:52.740]  And yet, in order for this building to come down at freefall speed and symmetrically,
[3:37:52.740 --> 3:37:58.340]  what you have to do is take out all the columns on a given floor within a tenth of a second
[3:37:58.340 --> 3:38:04.100]  of each other, and then synchronistically timed floor by floor.
[3:38:04.100 --> 3:38:10.340]  If your timing is off by fractions of a second, controlled demolitions begin to fail.
[3:38:10.340 --> 3:38:18.420]  They tip over because the law of nature is such that mass falls toward the path of least
[3:38:18.420 --> 3:38:19.420]  resistance.
[3:38:19.420 --> 3:38:28.100]  And there will always be in a natural, organic process, such as a fire collapse, a puff falling
[3:38:28.100 --> 3:38:30.860]  to the side because of that.
[3:38:30.860 --> 3:38:35.660]  Yeah, it's just insane that it would go through the path of most resistance, and in that model
[3:38:35.660 --> 3:38:39.660]  that you're talking about, you can actually watch that on YouTube, NIST has put together
[3:38:39.660 --> 3:38:43.580]  a three and a half minute video on behalf of themselves, of course, and then they're
[3:38:43.580 --> 3:38:45.900]  showing pieces of that in the CNN footage.
[3:38:45.900 --> 3:38:51.740]  But like you say, this central column apparently, through thermal expansion, detaches, I believe
[3:38:51.740 --> 3:38:58.300]  it was on the 17th floor, they said, or 13th floor, one of those floors, and then 13th
[3:38:58.300 --> 3:38:59.300]  floor.
[3:38:59.300 --> 3:39:03.220]  Yeah, and then the sides of that center start to collapse in, and like you said, they don't
[3:39:03.220 --> 3:39:07.420]  show the side of the building or the entire structure fall down, but they say that because
[3:39:07.420 --> 3:39:12.220]  it was the internal structure first, that's why you see the roof line go, and then that
[3:39:12.220 --> 3:39:14.860]  pulled the facade of the building down with it.
[3:39:14.860 --> 3:39:20.540]  Now, I've seen fires of just a small steel reinforced building.
[3:39:20.540 --> 3:39:22.340]  It came out about a month, month and a half ago.
[3:39:22.340 --> 3:39:26.660]  I think it was about five or six stories long, where the facade of the building does fall
[3:39:26.660 --> 3:39:30.900]  off due to fire, but that's only the concrete and the actual floor.
[3:39:30.900 --> 3:39:35.660]  The entire base of the building, in other words, the steel structure, remains standing,
[3:39:35.660 --> 3:39:36.660]  Richard.
[3:39:36.660 --> 3:39:39.360]  Yeah, this is an engineered process.
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:40.860]  It can only be that.
[3:39:40.860 --> 3:39:46.460]  Now, wouldn't we have chemical evidence of cutter charges in an explosive controlled
[3:39:46.460 --> 3:39:47.460]  demolition?
[3:39:47.460 --> 3:39:48.460]  Yes.
[3:39:48.460 --> 3:39:57.460]  It turns out that Dr. Stephen Jones, physicist, finds in the dust this evidence, and before
[3:39:57.460 --> 3:40:03.180]  we get to that, because he's looking at the molten metal found in the basements of not
[3:40:03.180 --> 3:40:05.820]  only World Trade Center 7, but 1 and 2.
[3:40:05.820 --> 3:40:11.340]  So where does all of this molten metal come from, seen by the World Trade Center structural
[3:40:11.340 --> 3:40:16.180]  engineer, Leslie Robertson himself, seen by structural engineer, Abel Hawthorne Astani,
[3:40:16.180 --> 3:40:23.340]  who had unfettered access to the fresh kills landfill, and seen by numerous first responders.
[3:40:23.340 --> 3:40:26.660]  They said flowing like lava from a volcano.
[3:40:26.660 --> 3:40:27.660]  They were kind of like a body.
[3:40:27.660 --> 3:40:28.660]  They were Ken Holden before FEMA.
[3:40:28.660 --> 3:40:33.220]  I mean, Ken Holden at the FEMA hearings literally talked about the molten metal dripping from
[3:40:33.220 --> 3:40:34.220]  building 6.
[3:40:34.220 --> 3:40:35.220]  Okay.
[3:40:35.220 --> 3:40:41.300]  So this was in, this was in that entire ground zero area, and we know that molten metal,
[3:40:41.300 --> 3:40:46.740]  especially steel and iron, cannot be formed from jet fuel fires, or fires that are less
[3:40:46.740 --> 3:40:47.740]  than 1,800 degrees.
[3:40:47.740 --> 3:40:52.300]  In fact, it takes around 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit for this process to begin, correct?
[3:40:52.300 --> 3:40:53.300]  Yeah.
[3:40:53.300 --> 3:41:00.940]  That's when steel begins to melt, but this molten stuff is easily at 3,500, 4,000 degrees.
[3:41:00.940 --> 3:41:03.620]  And that, and so where in the world could that come from?
[3:41:03.620 --> 3:41:09.060]  Well, first, they deny that it even exists, the molten metal.
[3:41:09.060 --> 3:41:11.820]  John Gross denies that the molten metal exists.
[3:41:11.820 --> 3:41:19.380]  He, he, and Shyam Sundar yesterday didn't even address the issue with dozens of witnesses.
[3:41:19.380 --> 3:41:21.620]  Well, we have photographs of it.
[3:41:21.620 --> 3:41:22.620]  Where could it come from?
[3:41:22.620 --> 3:41:31.740]  Well, one unusual cutter charge that can be used to be placed in a linear shaped cutter
[3:41:31.740 --> 3:41:37.900]  charge device is thermite, and in this particular patented device, it, it can eject in millions
[3:41:37.900 --> 3:41:38.900]  of a second.
[3:41:38.900 --> 3:41:42.140]  Very, very high tech stuff.
[3:41:42.140 --> 3:41:49.180]  And it turns out that it's byproduct, thermite, is molten iron, and it turns out that this
[3:41:49.180 --> 3:41:55.460]  is not melted steel, it is molten iron that melted through the steel beams, the ends of
[3:41:55.460 --> 3:42:03.300]  which were horribly corroded as documented actually by FEMA in their Appendix C in their
[3:42:03.300 --> 3:42:07.740]  report, which came out in May of 2002.
[3:42:07.740 --> 3:42:15.780]  That report specifies that they have very little faith in their best hypothesis.
[3:42:15.780 --> 3:42:19.620]  It has only a low probability of occurrence.
[3:42:19.620 --> 3:42:28.500]  And so, by the time that report came out, though, they, they had scrubbed the steel from
[3:42:28.500 --> 3:42:29.500]  the site.
[3:42:29.500 --> 3:42:37.180]  Systematically, 99.99% of the steel, structural steel from World Trade Center Seven, was sent
[3:42:37.180 --> 3:42:39.180]  to China for recycling.
[3:42:39.180 --> 3:42:45.900]  This is a, a, a, it is against the law, basically, this is a crime scene, and this is a illegal
[3:42:45.900 --> 3:42:47.900]  removal of evidence.
[3:42:47.900 --> 3:42:52.220]  Yeah, it's a heinous act of treason, yeah, it's a heinous act of treason, so that no
[3:42:52.220 --> 3:42:56.980]  real independent investigation can be done, where they can give you, basically, put out
[3:42:56.980 --> 3:42:59.220]  on an AP wire before the building even goes down.
[3:42:59.220 --> 3:43:03.380]  The official reason why it's going down, and now seven years later, that reason has been
[3:43:03.380 --> 3:43:05.780]  confirmed with literally no science.
[3:43:05.780 --> 3:43:10.780]  For instance, they said they looked at the possibility of explosives being used at the
[3:43:10.780 --> 3:43:12.540]  World Trade Center to bring it down.
[3:43:12.540 --> 3:43:16.780]  However, in their little three minute video, they said that that was discounted because
[3:43:16.780 --> 3:43:21.540]  there was no videotapes that showed the decibel levels that would have been possible to bring
[3:43:21.540 --> 3:43:22.540]  this building down.
[3:43:22.540 --> 3:43:26.900]  Now, we know if they used these thermate or thermite cutter charges, the decibel levels
[3:43:26.900 --> 3:43:28.780]  wouldn't have been that high.
[3:43:28.780 --> 3:43:30.900]  These, that's right, they would, yeah, go get it.
[3:43:30.900 --> 3:43:34.500]  Yeah, it's quieter, there might have been an incendiary.
[3:43:34.500 --> 3:43:39.660]  Now, and so they said that, well, it would be a bomb that would be ten times the loudness
[3:43:39.660 --> 3:43:40.820]  of a rock concert.
[3:43:40.820 --> 3:43:46.540]  Well, when I'm talking about a bomb, we're talking about hundreds of, of, of cutter
[3:43:46.540 --> 3:43:52.180]  charges, really high-tech cutter charges, which don't leave behind wires and, and blasting
[3:43:52.180 --> 3:43:53.180]  caps in traditional things.
[3:43:53.180 --> 3:43:57.420]  That's right, no debt cords, no blasting caps, so that disinformation that was on the History
[3:43:57.420 --> 3:44:01.260]  Channel last summer where the guys were like, well, we didn't find no debt cords, no blasting
[3:44:01.260 --> 3:44:02.260]  caps.
[3:44:02.260 --> 3:44:04.380]  Well, thermite takes care of that, doesn't it, Richard?
[3:44:04.380 --> 3:44:06.060]  Oh, don't tell me that's...
[3:44:06.060 --> 3:44:07.060]  He just dropped off, yeah.
[3:44:07.060 --> 3:44:08.060]  Oh!
[3:44:08.060 --> 3:44:09.060]  I'll call him right back, I'll call him right back.
[3:44:09.060 --> 3:44:10.060]  All right, we'll call him right back.
[3:44:10.060 --> 3:44:12.260]  I mean, this is from the horse's mouth.
[3:44:12.260 --> 3:44:18.420]  Richard Gage is a very dedicated individual, he knows what he's talking about.
[3:44:18.420 --> 3:44:20.180]  He has gone through a lot himself.
[3:44:20.180 --> 3:44:21.660]  This is a personal odyssey.
[3:44:21.660 --> 3:44:24.540]  People don't do this because they want to believe it.
[3:44:24.540 --> 3:44:28.300]  They do it because it is the right thing to do.
[3:44:28.300 --> 3:44:32.980]  In light of this evidence, we know we have been lied to about 9-11, and again, our entire
[3:44:32.980 --> 3:44:38.220]  foreign and domestic policy has been set up based on this lie.
[3:44:38.220 --> 3:44:41.260]  And World Trade Center, seven folks, it is the smoking gun.
[3:44:41.260 --> 3:44:43.300]  It's what I carry around on my phone.
[3:44:43.300 --> 3:44:46.660]  Most people still don't even know that it went down, okay?
[3:44:46.660 --> 3:44:47.900]  They don't know what it's housed.
[3:44:47.900 --> 3:44:52.860]  I mean, when you have the largest CIA base outside of Langley, Virginia, the largest
[3:44:52.860 --> 3:45:01.020]  Secret Service office in the world, the FBI, the SEC, the DOD, let me explain, CROAL does
[3:45:01.020 --> 3:45:03.580]  not run security on that building, okay?
[3:45:03.580 --> 3:45:05.940]  A national security apparatus does.
[3:45:05.940 --> 3:45:11.220]  So if this thing was brought down in a controlled demolition, and all, I mean, all of the evidence,
[3:45:11.220 --> 3:45:16.860]  evidence shows that it was, it can only be members within our own government that did
[3:45:16.860 --> 3:45:17.860]  this.
[3:45:17.860 --> 3:45:19.820]  Richard, I'm sorry they cut you off right there.
[3:45:19.820 --> 3:45:21.460]  Please go right back to where you were.
[3:45:21.460 --> 3:45:26.500]  That's okay, because I didn't need to hear what you just said.
[3:45:26.500 --> 3:45:31.940]  The architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth are not conspiracy theorists, and so we don't
[3:45:31.940 --> 3:45:32.940]  point fingers.
[3:45:32.940 --> 3:45:38.620]  We just ask for a real investigation, which would, if it were under oath and with subpoena
[3:45:38.620 --> 3:45:47.020]  power and appropriately commissioned, we would have answers to the kinds of questions
[3:45:47.020 --> 3:45:49.900]  that you're raising.
[3:45:49.900 --> 3:45:52.700]  Did we drop them again?
[3:45:52.700 --> 3:45:55.340]  All right, well, I guess that we just can't get Richard.
[3:45:55.340 --> 3:45:58.820]  Listen, we'll try to get Richard on sometime next week.
[3:45:58.820 --> 3:46:03.620]  Apologize to him for our phone difficulties, but Richard Gage, architects and engineers
[3:46:03.620 --> 3:46:06.900]  for 9-11 Truth, they are really top of the line.
[3:46:06.900 --> 3:46:10.540]  I guess I'm going to try to take phone calls then in the last 15 minutes or so.
[3:46:10.540 --> 3:46:12.260]  Let's see who's dropped and who hasn't.
[3:46:12.260 --> 3:46:16.180]  Our first in line is Rachel in California if she's still there.
[3:46:16.180 --> 3:46:17.180]  Rachel, are you with us?
[3:46:17.180 --> 3:46:18.180]  Yes, I'm here.
[3:46:18.180 --> 3:46:19.180]  How are you doing?
[3:46:19.180 --> 3:46:20.180]  I'm fine.
[3:46:20.180 --> 3:46:22.500]  I just had two quick things I wanted to say.
[3:46:22.500 --> 3:46:23.500]  Sure.
[3:46:23.500 --> 3:46:28.460]  One, I'm the person that made the petition for you to get on the Howard Stern Show.
[3:46:28.460 --> 3:46:29.460]  Oh, excellent.
[3:46:29.460 --> 3:46:31.580]  Sure, I contact you on Myspace every once in a while.
[3:46:31.580 --> 3:46:32.700]  You do a lot for this movement.
[3:46:32.700 --> 3:46:33.940]  You do what you can.
[3:46:33.940 --> 3:46:37.660]  You take your personal power and try to pursue the truth.
[3:46:37.660 --> 3:46:39.220]  Well, thank you.
[3:46:39.220 --> 3:46:47.940]  Anyways, I just wanted to give the URL so people can go there and sign it.
[3:46:47.940 --> 3:46:58.740]  The easiest way to get to it is just to go to my website and it's www.freewebs.com slash
[3:46:58.740 --> 3:47:01.740]  California 9-11 Truth.
[3:47:01.740 --> 3:47:02.740]  Give it out again.
[3:47:02.740 --> 3:47:03.740]  All right.
[3:47:03.740 --> 3:47:04.740]  Thank you so much, Rachel.
[3:47:04.740 --> 3:47:05.740]  I'm going to jump to the next caller.
[3:47:05.740 --> 3:47:06.740]  Let's jump to Sherry in Texas.
[3:47:06.740 --> 3:47:07.740]  Sherry, are you still there?
[3:47:07.740 --> 3:47:08.740]  Yep, still here.
[3:47:08.740 --> 3:47:24.380]  Hey, I just wanted to point out that if you don't know physics, which I don't know physics,
[3:47:24.380 --> 3:47:26.620]  I'm terrible at that kind of thing.
[3:47:26.620 --> 3:47:31.020]  A lot of Americans are just really bad at science and being able to understand all
[3:47:31.020 --> 3:47:32.020]  this stuff.
[3:47:32.020 --> 3:47:39.420]  If you don't understand that, then you can even just look at the economic factors involved.
[3:47:39.420 --> 3:47:40.820]  Who owned those buildings?
[3:47:40.820 --> 3:47:47.820]  I'm not going to say names, but if you look at that, you'll know who owned those buildings.
[3:47:47.820 --> 3:47:50.900]  If you follow the money, you can kind of figure things out.
[3:47:50.900 --> 3:47:56.740]  Well, Sherry, Larry Silverstein takes out a $200 million lease right before the attacks.
[3:47:56.740 --> 3:47:59.380]  He has a $20 million clause for terrorism.
[3:47:59.380 --> 3:48:00.900]  He ends up pulling in bills.
[3:48:00.900 --> 3:48:01.900]  Right.
[3:48:01.900 --> 3:48:02.900]  Right.
[3:48:02.900 --> 3:48:10.260]  And also, they only set apart, what, $16 million to investigate the buildings, you know, just
[3:48:10.260 --> 3:48:15.780]  falling from fire for the first time ever in history.
[3:48:15.780 --> 3:48:21.700]  And then, for Homeland Security, they got, like, what was it, billions and billions,
[3:48:21.700 --> 3:48:22.700]  billions of dollars.
[3:48:22.700 --> 3:48:23.700]  Well, they had to set up the infrastructure.
[3:48:23.700 --> 3:48:24.700]  Oh, yeah.
[3:48:24.700 --> 3:48:25.700]  They don't want an actual investigation.
[3:48:25.700 --> 3:48:26.700]  Exactly.
[3:48:26.700 --> 3:48:28.900]  Like George Carlin said, they don't investigate themselves.
[3:48:28.900 --> 3:48:29.900]  Absolutely.
[3:48:29.900 --> 3:48:30.900]  You don't want to.
[3:48:30.900 --> 3:48:31.900]  Right.
[3:48:31.900 --> 3:48:32.900]  And life is worth losing.
[3:48:32.900 --> 3:48:34.300]  Actually, that's from the confrontation.
[3:48:34.300 --> 3:48:35.500]  But in life is worth losing.
[3:48:35.500 --> 3:48:36.700]  He just goes through the whole thing.
[3:48:36.700 --> 3:48:41.580]  He says, listen, this is a big club, and you and I ain't in it, and it's the same big club.
[3:48:41.580 --> 3:48:45.060]  They beat us over the head with every day to tell us what to believe.
[3:48:45.060 --> 3:48:47.340]  I thank you so much for the call.
[3:48:47.340 --> 3:48:49.900]  Let's jump to Eric in Wisconsin.
[3:48:49.900 --> 3:48:53.180]  Eric, are you still on the line?
[3:48:53.180 --> 3:48:54.180]  He did drop.
[3:48:54.180 --> 3:48:55.180]  We did drop him.
[3:48:55.180 --> 3:48:56.180]  All right.
[3:48:56.180 --> 3:48:57.180]  Let's go to then Helen in Florida.
[3:48:57.180 --> 3:48:59.180]  Helen, are you with us?
[3:48:59.180 --> 3:49:07.300]  Yes, there's no one remember on PBS Larry Silverstein actually saying, I thought there's enough
[3:49:07.300 --> 3:49:08.300]  death.
[3:49:08.300 --> 3:49:10.300]  I decided to pull the building.
[3:49:10.300 --> 3:49:14.220]  Well, we played that clip earlier today at a terror storm, and I'd also like to point
[3:49:14.220 --> 3:49:22.940]  out that in the recent BBC documentary, they had Larry Silverstein's quote saying, you
[3:49:22.940 --> 3:49:24.900]  know, the pull of the building, and they showed part of it.
[3:49:24.900 --> 3:49:28.580]  But then they talked to Chief Daniel Nigro, and he said, look, if he was talking about
[3:49:28.580 --> 3:49:30.820]  pulling the firefighters, he would have had no say.
[3:49:30.820 --> 3:49:33.340]  He would have had no say in what I do with my department.
[3:49:33.340 --> 3:49:38.300]  So he debunked Larry Silverstein's lie that in fact they were pulling the firefighters.
[3:49:38.300 --> 3:49:39.300]  No.
[3:49:39.300 --> 3:49:41.060]  He was talking about a control demolition of the building.
[3:49:41.060 --> 3:49:43.020]  He slipped up on national television.
[3:49:43.020 --> 3:49:44.700]  Thank you for bringing up that point, Helen.
[3:49:44.700 --> 3:49:45.700]  All right.
[3:49:45.700 --> 3:49:49.300]  Let's jump to Jeff in Minnesota, who may be our last caller of the day.
[3:49:49.300 --> 3:49:50.540]  We got one more segment after this.
[3:49:50.540 --> 3:49:51.540]  Jeff, what's on your mind?
[3:49:51.540 --> 3:49:52.540]  All right.
[3:49:52.540 --> 3:49:55.300]  I got a couple things I want to plug right now.
[3:49:55.300 --> 3:50:01.220]  One thing that's going on, Dennis Kucinich, he's trying to get a million signatures to
[3:50:01.220 --> 3:50:02.220]  bring to Congress.
[3:50:02.220 --> 3:50:03.220]  Is that Kucinich.us?
[3:50:03.220 --> 3:50:04.220]  That's Kucinich.us.
[3:50:04.220 --> 3:50:05.220]  Kucinich.us.
[3:50:05.220 --> 3:50:07.620]  Everybody needs to go there.
[3:50:07.620 --> 3:50:08.620]  Kucinich.us.
[3:50:08.620 --> 3:50:09.620]  Kucinich.us.
[3:50:09.620 --> 3:50:11.020]  I've plugged it before.
[3:50:11.020 --> 3:50:12.020]  He's a great guy.
[3:50:12.020 --> 3:50:13.020]  Stay on the line, Jeff.
[3:50:13.020 --> 3:50:14.020]  I'm going to let you plug your other stuff.
[3:50:14.020 --> 3:50:15.900]  When we get back, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[3:50:15.900 --> 3:50:17.780]  I'm going to be here with you till Thursday.
[3:50:17.780 --> 3:50:29.860]  Remember, Fabled Enemies drops August 31st on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:50:29.860 --> 3:50:34.900]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals
[3:50:34.900 --> 3:50:38.060]  and businesses, but there is something you can do.
[3:50:38.060 --> 3:50:42.420]  Fuel Saver Incorporated's fuel enhancer formula will not only stretch each gallon of fuel
[3:50:42.420 --> 3:50:46.860]  further for mere pennies per treated gallon, but also cleans fuel injectors, pumps and
[3:50:46.860 --> 3:50:48.580]  reduces emissions.
[3:50:48.580 --> 3:50:53.420]  Average improvement in fuel economy typically ranges from 8 to 20 percent or more, saving
[3:50:53.420 --> 3:50:56.940]  you 30 to 80 cents on each gallon of fuel at the pump.
[3:50:56.940 --> 3:50:59.020]  Now there's a boost for your budget.

[3:51:34.100 --> 3:51:38.900]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:51:38.900 --> 3:51:41.100]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:51:41.100 --> 3:51:47.820]  Don't their objective be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:51:47.820 --> 3:51:52.780]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[3:51:52.780 --> 3:51:58.180]  80 percent of humanity is at hand.
[3:51:58.180 --> 3:52:03.220]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:52:03.220 --> 3:52:07.300]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:52:07.300 --> 3:52:11.300]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[3:52:11.300 --> 3:52:12.300]  Most people have no idea.
[3:52:12.300 --> 3:52:13.300]  They're not after money.
[3:52:13.300 --> 3:52:14.300]  They have all the money they need.
[3:52:14.300 --> 3:52:15.300]  They're after power.
[3:52:15.300 --> 3:52:16.300]  That's their aptitude.

[3:52:21.940 --> 3:52:22.940]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:22.940 --> 3:52:23.940]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved.
[3:52:23.940 --> 3:52:24.940]  You have been warned.
[3:52:24.940 --> 3:52:33.700]  Since the year 2000, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods, fires and hurricanes
[3:52:33.700 --> 3:52:37.740]  have killed over one million people worldwide and forced tens of millions to go without
[3:52:37.740 --> 3:52:38.740]  food and water.
[3:52:38.740 --> 3:52:42.940]  After Katrina, the media was eager to show victims in New Orleans begging for food.
[3:52:42.940 --> 3:52:47.100]  If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones and you have no stored food, you'll be begging
[3:52:47.100 --> 3:52:48.100]  as well.
[3:52:48.100 --> 3:52:51.620]  Now our economy is slipping into an abyss that even Donald Trump says will make the
[3:52:51.620 --> 3:52:54.100]  Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic.
[3:52:54.100 --> 3:52:57.660]  The U.S. dollar is worth less today than it was even last week.
[3:52:57.660 --> 3:53:01.780]  Before food prices skyrocket, trucks stop running and stores close their doors.
[3:53:01.780 --> 3:53:03.780]  Survival enterprises can help you prepare.
[3:53:03.780 --> 3:53:08.060]  They're master distributors of mountain house freeze-dried food with up to a 50-year shelf
[3:53:08.060 --> 3:53:09.060]  life.
[3:53:09.060 --> 3:53:13.180]  Survival enterprises has real butter, cheese and bread, real beef, chicken and turkey, all
[3:53:13.180 --> 3:53:15.180]  canned for long-term storage.
[3:53:15.180 --> 3:53:20.300]  For their website and more info, call 1-800-753-1981.
[3:53:20.300 --> 3:53:27.460]  That's 1-800-753-1981 and remember, if you wait until you need us, it's too late.
[3:53:27.460 --> 3:53:53.460]  Until now.
[3:53:53.460 --> 3:53:57.780]  Alright folks, we're back, Richard Gage called back, so we're going to give him the floor
[3:53:57.780 --> 3:54:02.700]  at the very, very end, the last two minutes to talk about how you can get involved in
[3:54:02.700 --> 3:54:03.700]  this whole thing.
[3:54:03.700 --> 3:54:08.300]  But right now we've got Jeff in Minnesota, we've given out Cassinish.us, that is in
[3:54:08.300 --> 3:54:10.900]  support of the impeachment, I assume, Jeff?
[3:54:10.900 --> 3:54:18.380]  Yes, impeachment, persecution, everything he's been fighting for, I mean, his little
[3:54:18.380 --> 3:54:24.980]  slogan is, make December, the day before the world changed, the day the world changed,
[3:54:24.980 --> 3:54:31.980]  September 10th, he wants to get that, the million signatures.
[3:54:31.980 --> 3:54:38.100]  And the other thing, I'm up here in Minnesota, so we got the convention coming here, so we're
[3:54:38.100 --> 3:54:40.660]  going to get a little taste of the police state pretty quick.
[3:54:40.660 --> 3:54:41.660]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:54:41.660 --> 3:54:44.420]  Well, you also have the Ron Paul convention, so I really think that a lot of things can
[3:54:44.420 --> 3:54:45.420]  be done.
[3:54:45.420 --> 3:54:48.820]  I've got to let you go because I have to go to Richard Gage, but I encourage anybody
[3:54:48.820 --> 3:54:54.260]  that is going to that Ron Paul convention or just to the RNC to man up with the camera
[3:54:54.260 --> 3:54:58.180]  and get ready for some thick and hairy stuff, I don't think they're ready for as many people
[3:54:58.180 --> 3:55:03.740]  are going to show up to this alternate convention with Jesse Ventura, Ron Paul, Amy Allen,
[3:55:03.740 --> 3:55:04.740]  and others.
[3:55:04.740 --> 3:55:08.060]  Alright, we've got Richard Gage back on the line, I'm sorry we dropped you twice, Richard.
[3:55:08.060 --> 3:55:11.060]  In the last couple minutes of the show, why don't you just tell people how they can get
[3:55:11.060 --> 3:55:12.060]  involved?
[3:55:12.060 --> 3:55:16.420]  You're constantly looking for more architects and engineers to join the cause, tell people
[3:55:16.420 --> 3:55:17.420]  how they can do that.
[3:55:17.420 --> 3:55:23.140]  Yeah, it is so easy to do something relative to 9-Eleven Truth.
[3:55:23.140 --> 3:55:26.980]  The American people have to be woken up, and we've made it pretty easy.
[3:55:26.980 --> 3:55:33.940]  If you go to the website, A-E-9-Eleven-Truth.org, all people have to do is download this letter,
[3:55:33.940 --> 3:55:38.300]  this three page letter that I've written, and attach it at the PDF, attach it to an
[3:55:38.300 --> 3:55:47.180]  email that your listeners, I'm asking them, all of them, all of you, to write an email
[3:55:47.180 --> 3:55:52.860]  to every architect and engineer that you can find, attach this letter, and say, hey, I'm
[3:55:52.860 --> 3:55:56.620]  not technical, please review this.
[3:55:56.620 --> 3:56:01.580]  Why are there 435 architects and engineers demanding a real investigation when there's
[3:56:01.580 --> 3:56:07.380]  only a half a dozen to a dozen that actually support the official conspiracy story?
[3:56:07.380 --> 3:56:10.100]  Please check it out and let me know.
[3:56:10.100 --> 3:56:11.100]  That is easy.
[3:56:11.100 --> 3:56:15.860]  We also have the DVDs online at our website.
[3:56:15.860 --> 3:56:17.100]  You can listen to it.
[3:56:17.100 --> 3:56:18.700]  You can purchase it.
[3:56:18.700 --> 3:56:22.500]  We have materials, cards that you can hand out to people on the street, banners that
[3:56:22.500 --> 3:56:28.820]  you can put out in front of architecture offices, architecture schools, hundreds of
[3:56:28.820 --> 3:56:31.820]  architects and engineers demand a real investigation.
[3:56:31.820 --> 3:56:37.340]  It's extremely important that Americans wake up because we are promised another informed
[3:56:37.340 --> 3:56:44.420]  or worse, 9-11, by members of the Bush administration, the media, and the Congress.
[3:56:44.420 --> 3:56:46.140]  This is extremely disturbing.
[3:56:46.140 --> 3:56:51.100]  We've witnessed, as I mentioned, the controlled demolition of our democracy through this legislation,
[3:56:51.100 --> 3:56:56.820]  such as the Patriot Act, the Military Commission's Act, the forthcoming Homegrown Terrorism Act.
[3:56:56.820 --> 3:57:02.940]  We cannot afford to wait any longer for the next 9-11 and whatever legislation it might
[3:57:02.940 --> 3:57:06.660]  bring under the guises of a false flag attack.
[3:57:06.660 --> 3:57:08.420]  Will it be Iran?
[3:57:08.420 --> 3:57:10.860]  Will we lose an aircraft carrier?
[3:57:10.860 --> 3:57:12.100]  Let's not wait.
[3:57:12.100 --> 3:57:19.020]  Let's wake people up to the reality that every war has started with such a false flag operation
[3:57:19.020 --> 3:57:20.540]  in order to bring us in.
[3:57:20.540 --> 3:57:21.540]  After all-
[3:57:21.540 --> 3:57:24.020]  We have to use this new report as fuel to the fire, right, Richard?
[3:57:24.020 --> 3:57:25.020]  Yes.
[3:57:25.020 --> 3:57:31.300]  This report, as ridiculous as it is from this, on the World Trade Center 7 collapsed by normal
[3:57:31.300 --> 3:57:36.940]  office fires, can be used and people will not buy it, as they have to be shown that
[3:57:36.940 --> 3:57:42.140]  this 47-story building was brought down symmetrically at freefall speed.
[3:57:42.140 --> 3:57:44.460]  All right, Richard, thank you so much.
[3:57:44.460 --> 3:57:46.700]  It's architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[3:57:46.700 --> 3:57:50.060]  Remember the rebroadcast comes in at about 90 seconds.
[3:57:50.060 --> 3:57:54.380]  We had Benjamin Fulford, Jonathan Elinof, Shane Geiger, Bob Chapman, and of course Richard
[3:57:54.380 --> 3:57:55.380]  Gage.
[3:57:55.380 --> 3:57:59.700]  We went over the World Trade Center 7, NIST report, ad nauseum, Iraq and McCain going
[3:57:59.700 --> 3:58:00.700]  down to ground zero.
