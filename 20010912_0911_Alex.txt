[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]  I love Mike Hanson archives.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, it's September 12, 2001. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  On 9-1-1, on 9-11 of September 2001 yesterday, as we do this show live,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  a mass bombing that I have predicted for the last five years occurred.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]  They are going to now use terrorism as a pretext to destroy our civil liberties.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  I believe from all of the evidence before us that I'm about to cover,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  either the government actually carried out this bombing themselves,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  the New World Order occupational government, to create the crisis to offer the solution,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]  or ladies and gentlemen, they allowed terrorists from somewhere in the world
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  who were state-sponsored because of the sophistication of this,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]  to engage in this sinister activity.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  You are now going to see a massive response, an all-out covert war,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]  with assassinations of leaders in Middle Eastern nations,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  special forces being unleashed globally, also probably cruise missiles and bomb attacks,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  perhaps even nuclear, we've been hearing some discussion of tactical nukes being used.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]  Things are never going to be the same.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  The Israelis moved into the West Bank and attacked the Palestinians,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  who fought back with sticks and stones last night.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]  If you believe the Palestinians waged this sophisticated attack,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  hijacking at least four planes, now we're hearing five or six,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  the whereabouts of which are unknown, then you believe that ants can fly to the moon.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  These people have absolutely nothing. I'm not defending them.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  Hire people calling into radio talk shows, calling into my talk shows,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  saying we should turn all of the Middle East into a glass parking lot.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  Yeah, let's kill a couple hundred million people, many of which are innocent.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  We don't even know if they were responsible, though the government since hour one
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  has been telling us this, just like they did in April 19, 1995,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  for the first two days, telling us it was Arab terrorists.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  We've proven Oklahoma City was a government terrorist bombing.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host, my website, full of the documentation,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  we're about to cover isinfowars.com.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  I want to thank Mike Hansen for being here to run the show today.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  We have been predicting this nightmarish development for years,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  and now it is beginning to unfold.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]  You're not going to hear this information anywhere else, my friends,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  from the few isolated talk radio stations and analysts around the world.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  They need terrorism as a pretext to bring in the modern police state.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]  Hitler burned the Reichstag, blew up his own Capitol building right after being elected
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  to abolish the presidency and declare himself the Fuhrer.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  He then confiscated the guns and began to turn his secret police,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  the Gestapo, the SS, loose on the public.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]  It's now even on the History Channel with the actual communication documents
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]  that Pearl Harbor was a terrorist action,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  and that the federal government allowed it to transpire to create the indignation,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]  to create the pretext for that war.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  I'm not defending Imperial Japan any more than I am defending Osama bin Laden.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  But at this point, we don't know who engaged in these attacks.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  We just have suspects.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]  But I have a big question.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  Who stands to gain from all of this?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  Who has the motive?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  Well, the EU has a motive, the federal government has a motive,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  and Middle Eastern terrorists have a motive.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  But I remember the first World Trade Center bombing.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  It only killed about a dozen people and injured a thousand from smoke inhalation.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  And a few months later, it was in the October 28, 1993 New York Times front page,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  that the FBI was recorded by informants, the head of the FBI in New York,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  saying the bombing goes forward.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  You see, the FBI hired Arabic-speaking agents like Mr. Salaam to go in there
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  and cook the bomb, train the drivers, tell them where to park it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  Mr. Salaam came to them and said, look, they're going to bomb it in three days.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  They said the bombing goes forward, let them bomb it.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  He thought he was going to be framed for it.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  He came back in to an FBI conference room and recorded them all three days before
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  the first World Trade Center bombing in 93, saying let the bombing go forward.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  October 28, 1993, huge expose, New York Times.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  You never heard anything else about it.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  Why did you hear about it that time?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  Because Mr. Salaam called the news conference, played the tape.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  The feds admitted it was real.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]  It took them a day to sweep it under the rug and get control of the media.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  Well, now we're in 2001.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  It's eight years later, and they have the power and the control
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]  to pull this type of thing off.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  Also, the designer of the World Trade Centers is saying that there's no way
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  that those planes could do that, that they could collapse in that fashion.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  So the government has responded with its experts, saying the floor has collapsed,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]  building up pressure, and caused those buildings to go down.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  If that was the case, the designer of the World Trade Centers
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]  in the Chicago Tribune is saying that the building would have split apart,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  like we saw some of the top sections do, not fall in five seconds.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  Only demolition charges will do that.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  I will be interviewing General Benton Parton, former head of Air Force
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  weapons development, on my nighttime radio broadcast this evening
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  from 9 to midnight central.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  I have the number one show on FM for years here.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000]  It is syndicated across the country, but in the last two years, almost two years,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]  I have been censored here in Austin, just like Mr. Hightower and others,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]  so you'll have to tune in at Infowars.com.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]  I'm live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m.,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]  and then, of course, back live from 9 to midnight.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  This is what we're facing right now.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]  This is what we're dealing with.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]  A show aired today, a tape from three weeks ago.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]  I saw it on TV during a radio break, and there I was,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]  predicting the government was going to blow up major buildings
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  and try to bring in a civil emergency and tell us we have to go through checkpoints
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  and we have to give up our liberties for security.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  That's all you've seen on the news today.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  That's all you've seen on the news yesterday.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]  I want to tell you something.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  I condemn whoever engaged in this attack, but this only helps the global government.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  This only helps the controllers bring you a police state.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  So I want you to understand me loud and clear.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  I have predicted this.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  We're going to go through the evidence of past government bombings for you this evening.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  I suggest you take this program.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  But I also want to say this is only the beginning.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  This is only the beginning.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  You're going to see more of these events heightening, getting worse, escalating,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  I believe is the operative word, here in the near future.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]  There could be a biological attack loose right now.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]  Even the government's saying this.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]  We won't find out for a couple more days if it's smallpox or anthrax.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  By then it may spread across the country.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  The feds have been saying we're going to get hit.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]  It's not a question of if but when and give up your rights when it does.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]  How many news stories have I read to you in the last five, six years here on Access covering that?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  How many radio shows have I done in the last five, six years documenting the Segalian dialectic
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]  of problem, reaction, solution to get the desired response?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000]  From Hitler burning the Reichstag to Pearl Harbor allowing the Japanese to attack.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  We have the actual documents now from the Library of Congress.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]  It's on History Channel.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  To the feds wanting to blow up civilian airliners and attack Guantanamo Bay back in 1962
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  and Kennedy saying no.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  To the World Trade Center bombing in 93, Oklahoma City in 95.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  These have all been government terrorist provocateur actions
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  or they have actually been the government engaging in it.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]  Now a lot of you are primitively being manipulated right now.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000]  I felt the tribal pull in the last two days to announce to my massive listenership on the radio
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]  that we should go ahead and nuke the Middle East because people are calling in wanting that.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  Think about it for a second.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]  We don't even know the Middle East did that.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]  Of course it would feel good to do that.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]  To sit in our easy chairs as part of some primitive sports like entertainment
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]  and attack third world nations.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  But the facts are from MSNBC on Infowars.com that bin Laden is a known CIA asset.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]  Now I've been saying that for years.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]  He ran the Afghan war for the CIA in the 1980s against the Russians.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000]  His family still builds all of the military bases for the U.S. in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]  His brother sits on the board of Iridium Satellite Company.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  I want you to think about that.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]  And I want you to think about it long and hard.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]  But let's go through some more of the evidence that this points towards a government bombing
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]  to create a crisis to offer a solution.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]  And that only the government stands to gain.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]  And that only the government has the motive to do this.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  But first, if we attack the Middle East, as Israel is wanting us to do, and we nuke them,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  20 years from now they're going to have nukes.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  Iran already has them.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]  Syria already has them.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]  And we're going to get nuked.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]  And it's only going to be an escalation.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  And if we try to invade Afghanistan, if we try to invade countries that have defeated the Russians,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  we're going to see hundreds of thousands of dead U.S. soldiers.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  We're going to see American families losing their sons and daughters.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  All because of blowback, at the bare minimum, of a CIA boogeyman, Osama bin Laden.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  Let's say Iraq is behind this.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  Saddam Hussein was put into power by the CIA and the Ba'ath Party in the 1970s.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]  He was our big buddy during the 1980s when he was attacking Iran.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  April Glaspy, in 1990, five days before he invaded Kuwait, told Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]  It's on videotape.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  You've heard about that.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  You've seen it.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]  We've aired it on this show.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  You primitively want to wave the flag.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]  You want to say, go get them, when you don't even know who's done it.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  You may even think by me asking you to think that I'm anti-American.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  I'm pro-American.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  But that American flag symbolizes the Bill of Rights and the Constitution of this constitutional republic.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  Not a democracy, as we're hearing.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]  This is an attack on democracy.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  Founding fathers hated democracy.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  It is manufacture consent.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  It is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  In a republic, the rule of law and the minority as well as the majority are honored.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  And a democracy is a crisis if you say kill the black people.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  If 51% vote yes, they die.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  In a republic, you have a rule of law and a Bill of Rights.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  That can't happen.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]  So ask yourself, are we pledging allegiance to the republic?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000]  But we say we're a democracy.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  Now if we go in and attack the wrong country, we will only create more martyrs.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  We will only escalate this war.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  Biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons are proliferating massively.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  And you and your family will be the recipients.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]  This is escalating.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]  The key here is to have a real investigation and find out why things have gotten this bad.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  The real thing to find out is who's behind this and who stands to gain.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  Now I said the EU earlier.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  The European Union as we speak is rolling out the Euro dollar.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  It is 30% gold backed.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]  It is not a fiat currency.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]  Our Federal Reserve notes are purely fiat.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  Nothing backs them but our taxes and our homes and our families and our property.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]  And that's why it's all being confiscated right now.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  That's why we're losing our sovereignty.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  It's because the Federal Reserve private bankers have set up a debt money system and are taking control.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000]  Now they want a police state to get their property under control and they're using this as a pretext.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  The EU has said publicly and I've read the stories here on the air eight months ago at their Davos, Switzerland meeting.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  They said to everybody, we repeat, want to turn the US economy off like a light switch.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]  It is Europe's time to shine.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  They are merging.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]  13 of the 15 member states are run by socialist and communist.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]  Admitted.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]  Here's EU today.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  Euro Herald bragging about this.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]  They blow up our financial center.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]  Suddenly the Euro is trading above the dollar.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  Stock markets are plunging globally and people are grabbing up the Euros hungrily as they become the reserve currency of Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  The Middle East, Russia and Africa.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  You see the dollar is worthless, but people have value in it.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  So it trades on the currency markets as the number one note.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]  If we lose that, suddenly we can't buy slave goods from China anymore.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]  All we have is our dollars.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]  We're being deindustrialized.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  So the number one suspect in all of this is the European Union and an economic war that's going on with two different blocks of the New World Order.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000]  Number two suspects are the military industrial complex of this country with the FBI and special forces running this operation.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000]  The third suspects are Arab terrorists, state backed, being funded through their own system.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]  The fourth suspects, the Chinese military.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]  Now you're going to hear Henry Kissinger and former Secretary of State.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  You're going to hear Frank Heating, governor of Oklahoma City, who's one of the architects of the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  You're going to hear Bush, Condoleezza Rice.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000]  You're going to hear Chuckie Schumer, the senator who I saw jumping up and down and laughing out front the Capitol yesterday on live television.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  He was in the back room, as you know, and he was laughing.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]  Because he's going to get his police there.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  He's going to get your guns now if you don't stand up against these people.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]  They're telling you give up your liberty for security.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  Now I have Kissinger on tape saying this.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  Now here's the question I have for you out there.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  How does giving up liberty for security safeguard?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  That was Hitler's mantra.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]  Give up all your liberty and I'll give you security.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  Give me your guns, I'll take care of you.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  Give me total power and don't question me and everything will be alright.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]  This is why this helps the government.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]  This is why they would want to do this because it's about power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]  That's all it's ever been about.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000]  Now our forefathers and our veterans from Korea to World War II to Vietnam
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  fought to safeguard our individual liberties, our open, free society.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000]  But that in the future and today currently is changing.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]  They say we've woken up, our innocence is over.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]  We need to give up our liberty for security.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  Benjamin Franklin said he that will give up liberty for security will deserves and will get neither.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]  Liberty nor security.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  So we hear world leaders from Tony Blair to Gerhard Schroeder of Germany to Bush's cabinet
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  to Chuckie Schumer, the gun-grabbing senator, saying give up liberty for security.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]  Henry Kissinger said, and I've got his quotes here in the AP,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000]  that we need to get past this outdated moral argument about an open, free society.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]  We need to accept control.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]  And they've been saying that for years.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  And it's not a question of if but when this was going to happen.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  And now it's happened.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  And I heard a young Marine call into KLBJ this morning and tell the host of that show,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  Sergeant Sam Cox, who disagreed with him, thank God, and Mark Caesar,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  that I was in martial law in the Philippines and it's not that bad.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  We should go under martial law.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  And if the terrorist attacks get worse, we will.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  But it's not going to be the Chinese military running the Long Beach Naval Base
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]  or the Panama Canal or moving into Cuba with missiles.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  It's not going to be our borders being wide open, which they did deliberately.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]  That's not going to be shut down.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]  That's not going to be stopped.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  It's going to be you and I.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  So here's the point.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]  Our forefathers, the women that supported them, that fought and died as well,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]  fought to give you a free and open society.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]  And now we get attacked and they're saying we should give up our freedom,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]  give up our liberty for security.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]  You know, when the British in 1776 were shelling Boston
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]  and the whole city was burning and tens of thousands were dying,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]  did we say, oh, we've got to give up our liberty for security?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]  We said we've got to fight back against these pieces of garbage,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000]  against these redcoats, against these imperial invaders.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000]  But now they're telling us, oh, no, just give up your liberty for security.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]  And we've heard that mantra for years and now we're hearing it again.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]  And when we had the Oklahoma City bombing, which we've proven was a government bombing,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  with the former head of the FBI crime lab on this show, Dr. Frederick Whitehurst,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]  who quit over it, General Benton Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]  saying the Feds did it, to one of the grand jurors, Hoppy Heidelberg,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]  being threatened by the FBI to keep his mouth shut,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]  to Craig Roberts, a police detective there on the ground,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]  talking about how his partners were killed for trying to expose this,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]  to the Feds confiscating the 12 surveillance camera tapes that were in buildings around the Oklahoma City building
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]  and declaring national security and not releasing them.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]  If you've got McVeigh pulling up and doing the bombing, why not show it to us?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]  They got the Anti-Terrorism Effective Death Penalty Act passed.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]  They've got 60 reasons to execute you now.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]  They're building federal execution centers across the country.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]  Our prison population has gone from 1.3 million to 6.5 million in the last two years.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]  Three times the people in Russian prisons now in this country.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]  The police are wearing black uniforms and ski masks.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]  They're busting in our houses and shooting us.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  And all this gives them more of a pretext that we're the enemy,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]  and we have to be watched, and the face-scanning cameras have to scan us,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]  and we've got a thumb scan to cash our checks, and the biometrics are going in the grocery stores.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]  I predicted all of this, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:12.000]  over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:22.000]  Now this takes some complex thinking to understand that this government is not our government.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000]  This government is a group of usurpers that have come in and taken control of the security agencies,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  declared the 1947 National Security Act,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  started excavating and building giant underground bases,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]  started breeding biological and chemical weapons in huge vats,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]  started handing it out to every Middle Eastern group you can imagine,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]  started funding and financing huge terrorist training centers
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.000]  that the statesman's even reported on in North Carolina.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]  Guys, let's stay off the phone and stay focused.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]  So this is what's going on.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]  This is what we are facing.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]  And it's not going to get any better anytime soon until we know who is behind this terrorism.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]  And I'm telling you, who stands to gain?
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]  There's a person falling out of a window.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]  I'm telling you who stands to gain, and that is this government.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]  That is this corrupt government.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]  This is not our government.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]  This is an occupational government.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]  So everything we fought and died for, our founding fathers,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]  to have a free and open society, to have liberty, to stand against tyranny,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000]  they're telling us, let's get rid of it, let's get rid of it now.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  In the name of security, give up liberty.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]  And it's not going to give you that.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]  Now let's talk about what the government is really doing to destroy our security.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000]  Then we'll talk about them actually planning to do these exact events from the Baltimore Sun.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]  Now listen to me.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.000]  Listen to me long and hard and listen to me very carefully.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]  I warned you three years ago that this government was not allowing anyone to bid
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]  on getting the contracts for the Panama Canal that we built.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  China went in there and leased it.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]  They have their military at both ends of it.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]  They have moved into the Bahamas with huge military bases.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]  This is in the news.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]  The Russians were given 12 islands by Clinton off the coast of Alaska.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]  Alexander Leavitt, the general, told us they've moved suitcase nukes into this country.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]  The borders are open, wide open and porous.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]  They're talking about totally getting rid of our southern and northern borders
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]  where these terrorists we now know came in through.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]  And I told you that they're telling you to give up your liberty and security
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]  while they're opening the borders, while they're making the security more and more lax.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]  The Bill of Rights and Constitution states the government has a right
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]  to have martial law at the borders.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000]  A perpetual state of militarization on our borders with our navy.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]  The borders are to be defended.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]  They're not talking about that, are they?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]  They're talking about controlling you and your family,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]  which has nothing to do with stopping terrorism.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]  Why are we not worried about the Chinese military?
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]  Last year I read the story said that we will nuke you if you get involved in Taiwan.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]  We will nuke you if you get involved in the handover of Hong Kong.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]  We will destroy Los Angeles.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]  We will kill 200 million Americans, the people's daily, in China.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]  What's our response?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]  Oh, yes, sir.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]  Here's the Olympic Games.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]  We'll give that to you.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]  Oh, yes, sir.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]  We'll have Fortune 500 meetings in Beijing, China.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  Oh, we don't care if you take political dissidents organs
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]  and sell them through New York, BBC.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]  That's just fine.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  China's not the threat.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]  Russia's not the threat.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]  They're our big buddies now as they build huge underground bases under the Urals,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]  roll out new Topolim missiles.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]  But it gets worse.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]  George Bush's father allowed contracts to design and perfect Chinese missiles
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]  and missile designs.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]  Clinton expanded that and helped perfect their Long March intercontinental ballistic,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]  helped sell them submarine components,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]  helped sell them cruise missile factories and F-16 factories
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]  and supercomputers to design missile technology.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]  And then the plans for all our nuclear weapons disappeared from Los Alamos
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000]  during those fires last year and showed up in China.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]  And who is China openly giving nukes to?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]  Who does China openly have 10,000 nuclear engineers in their country?
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]  Iran.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]  This government cares about you.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]  This government's going to stop terrorism.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]  The Chinese communists that have killed 50 million of their own people
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]  now have the Panama Canal.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]  They're about to attack Taiwan and doing war drills.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]  Look at the geopolitical ramifications of this.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]  They're arming Syria with nukes who already has them.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  They're arming Iran and giving them the delivery systems
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]  or being completely encircled.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]  And they're telling you to give up your rights
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]  and to go through checkpoints on the highway
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]  and to thumb scan to get your food
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]  and to accept this guilty until proven innocent garbage
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]  when it flies in the face of what America stands for.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]  If we give in to that, there's no reason to fight for America
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]  because America is dead.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]  I am angry about these terrorist bombings,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]  but I'm telling you right now,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]  90% chance it came from the U.S. government or from the EU.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]  I'm sure they did use Arab terrorists as their front.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]  Bin Laden is their asset.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]  I have MSNBC right here.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]  Now, might need to go to some of those other tapes, Mike.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]  We got some other footage in those other tapes in the stack.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]  Give me a close shot, brother.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000]  This story is on Infowars.com.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:05.000]  New book on NSA sheds light on secret U.S. terror plan
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]  called Cuba Invasion Pretext.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]  And I read Baltimore Sun, also in the New York Times,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]  in April this year.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]  U.S. military leaders proposed in 62 a secret plan
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]  to commit terrorist acts against Americans
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]  and blame Cuba to create a pretext for invasion
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]  in the ouster of communist leader Fidel Castro,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]  according to a new book about the National Security Agency.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]  Now, they signed on to this plan, the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]  the CIA signed on, the NSA signed on,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]  the Library of Congress, they have the documents,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]  New York Times reviewed James Bamford, 2020 Executive's book.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]  I interviewed James Bamford.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]  His interview on the radio has been turned into Access to Air.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]  I don't know when it's going to air.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]  They talk about blowing up airliners, the government,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]  the U.S. government, and blaming it on Cuba.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]  And I'm no fan of Fidel, but you don't turn into Fidel
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]  to fight Fidel.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]  And Kennedy said no.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]  Everybody said yes, let's do it.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]  Kennedy said no, six months later he was dead.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]  Baltimore Sun.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]  NSA documents released.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]  This is what they're releasing.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]  Maybe somebody in the government was trying to warn us
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]  when these packets of documents got sent to the newspapers.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000]  Right there, ladies and gentlemen, on Infowars.com.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]  We could develop a communist terror campaign in the Miami area
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]  and other Florida cities, and even in Washington,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]  said one document prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]  We could blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]  The document says casualty lists, and I quote,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]  casualty lists in the U.S. newspapers
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]  would cause a helpful wave of indignation.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]  Casualty lists, that means dead people.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]  Casualty lists in the U.S. newspapers could cause
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]  a helpful wave of indignation.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]  I've been reading this story every week,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]  every Wednesday since April.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]  And other stories.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]  The plan is laid out in documents signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]  but never carried out.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]  President Kennedy nixed the plan in late 1962.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]  The documents are reprinted in Body of Secrets,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]  the new history of Fort Meade based eavesdropping agency
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]  being released today by double day.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]  It says here they plan to attack the Marines at Guantanamo Bay
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]  using U.S. Army dressed up as Cuban nationals
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]  as a pretext.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]  It says they plan to blow up passenger liners.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]  They plan to bomb the Capitol.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]  It was code named Operation Northwoods.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]  It says it may be the worst corrupt plan ever created
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]  by the U.S. government, he writes.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]  They also proposed that during the proposed launch
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]  of John Glenn into orbit,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]  that they would blow up the spacecraft
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]  and blame it on terrorists.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]  ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency show.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]  I want you to understand that.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]  This is the Baltimore Sun.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]  I have the New York Times right here.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]  I have MSNBC admitting that bin Laden is a known CIA asset
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]  still being funded by them.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]  You know what?
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]  It's going to feel so good to nuke Iraq, isn't it?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]  Why didn't we take Saddam out in 1991?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]  We were 50 miles from Baghdad.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]  Why did we fund China and give them the nuclear missile designs
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]  when they're giving it to Iran?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]  Why did the Chinese military have the Long Beach Naval Base
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]  and Panama Canal?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]  They're not talking about that.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]  They're talking about taking control of us, the American people,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]  using militant enthusiasm, using phony nationalism.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]  The globalists love to wave a flag in front of a people
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]  and say, support us.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]  This isn't America doing this.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]  And I'm telling you, 9 out of 10 chances that was a government bombing
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]  that you're looking at on your screen.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]  Now the designer of the World Trade Center is saying this is impossible.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]  I've had other engineers on my radio program saying that it's a bogus story,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]  saying collapsing floors could do this.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]  The building could bend and fall over sideways and break off.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]  It would not fall in five seconds symmetrically.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]  And then the next one.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]  We're getting the tape.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]  We didn't get a tape of it.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]  I saw it on the news.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]  Jeff Ward talked about it yesterday.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]  On NBC yesterday, when the first tower collapsed,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]  there was a huge explosion before it fell
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]  and fire shooting out of the bottom floors.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]  Seismographs picked up those explosions.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000]  It was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]  just like when you see them destroy a building in Las Vegas.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]  Then it goes...
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]  But all they need is their pretext.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]  And to fool enough of you,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]  we're going to be living martial law in this country.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]  And it's not going to be called martial law.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]  It's going to be called safety.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]  I've made films about this.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]  I've done a thousand radio interviews covering this.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]  I do six hours a day of radio live every day.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]  And I've told all of you,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]  there is a ray of hope in all of this government bombing we've all witnessed.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]  And then we're going to go to your calls
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000]  on this 12th of September edition of the show at 477-2288.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000]  477-2288.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000]  I want you to understand something out there.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]  This is only the beginning.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]  And you're going to see more of these events in the future,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]  as the feds lovingly told you.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]  The police get their federal riot gear
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]  and black combat uniforms delivered.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]  Yeah, let's show them that plane crashing, Mike.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]  Back that up.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]  And suddenly we have a Mardi Gras riot.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]  In Seattle, we have proof
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]  that the feds actually hired 50 provocateurs
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]  to discredit the protestors
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]  and they actually housed them in a city building
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]  and then they took peaceful people to a FEMA camp
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]  and abolished the First Amendment in Seattle
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]  and said, we can't let this happen to our city again.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]  We're abolishing the First Amendment for your safety.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]  And put people in a FEMA camp.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]  I've put up the Army documents, the website.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]  Mike, do you have that in the CG machine, the Army website,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]  where they admit they have 12 camps already built?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]  Call Violet and get her to give you that URL.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]  I didn't bring that document today.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]  So this is what we are facing.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]  Now, repeat, Baltimore Sun, New York Times,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]  documents signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]  Secretary of State, all the way up to Kennedy,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]  who said no, he was dead six months later
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]  in a military industrial complex coup.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]  He's been living in martial law ever since, folks.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]  Incrementally destroying freedom.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]  He said, I will not blow up passenger airliners.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]  I will not bomb Washington.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]  I will not attack the Marines at Guantanamo
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]  and blame it on Fidel Castro.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]  I'm not a liberal, folks.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]  I'm not a socialist.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]  The loving liberals are behind all of this.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]  Chuckie Schumer, Senator Schumer is dancing right now.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]  I saw him on TV dancing and clapping last night
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]  when they were up there singing God Bless America.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000]  He was afterwards hugging people.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]  Finally going to get what you want, aren't you, you bastard?
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Baltimore Sun
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]  on Infowars.com, there at the top of the page.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]  And we have more.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]  Let me find it.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]  I got this all confused.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000]  We have the actual MSNBC story admitting bin Laden
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]  is a CIA asset, as I've been telling you on the air
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000]  in an emergency fashion for the last five plus years.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]  Think about it.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]  Got up here a little bit late today.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]  I just put on the radio endlessly.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]  Here it is right here.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.000]  Please give me a close shot, Mr. Hanson.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000]  Bin Laden comes home to roost.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]  1998.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]  This is how powerful our archives are at Infowars.com.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]  Throw it back up, Mike.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]  This guy supposedly bombed Twin Towers,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]  supposedly bombed our embassy, supposedly bombed all this stuff.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]  And he is a CIA.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]  Put it up there.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]  A CIA asset.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]  Bin Laden comes home to roost.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000]  His CIA ties are only the beginning of this woeful story.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]  Funded.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]  Created.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]  As of last year, his family was still rebuilding
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]  and constructing U.S. Army bases in the Middle East.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]  They sit on the board of Iridium Satellite.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]  They are one of the most wealthy old families of Saudi Arabia.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]  Our ally.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]  This is Saudi Arabia doing dirty work for us.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:33.000]  Working with Israel to oppress the people of the planet.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]  Israel loves it.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]  That Nazi Sharon has invaded the West Bank.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]  They are slaughtering innocent people.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]  And I am sick of worshiping Israel.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]  Did you know back in the 1960s they bombed the USS Liberty
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]  knowing it was one of our ships?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]  Because it caught the radio chatter of them killing thousands of Palestinian children
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]  during that invasion.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]  And they torpedoed it as they begged for hours on the radio.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]  And LBJ sat there in 1963 and let them do it.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]  That is in this Baltimore Sun story.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]  I don't support the Palestinians either.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]  They are all hyped up and psychotic.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]  But Israel is going to get us nuked always backing them up like this.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000]  Israel calls the Palestinians goyim or cattle or dogs or sub-human.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]  They keep them on concentration camps.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]  I have got video of them taking Palestinian women's tomatoes they grow
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]  and breaking their water containers and stealing.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]  That is why you have this crap.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]  And our children are going to die.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]  We are going to get nuked because of this.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]  Iran has got the nukes now.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]  Syria.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]  We are going to have nuclear war.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]  Because Israel likes to go around bombing everybody.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]  I am sorry it is just the facts.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]  And Israel absolutely is beside itself with joy right now.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]  They are talking about how they are going to blow everything up.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]  How they are going to attack everybody.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]  And guess who is going to get bombed because of it.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:06.000]  I have been supportive of Israel for many years.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]  But when I found out what they do shooting little Palestinian children in the genitalia
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]  and laughing it is on video.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]  Little ten year olds walk around throwing rocks at tanks.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]  A guy sits off a half mile away and blows their testicles off.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]  They call them goyim.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]  They call them dogs.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]  They call the Arabs cattle.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]  And then the corrupt Arab governments that are in league with this government.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]  It is really a sick Hegelian dialectic.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]  Order out of chaos.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]  Bringing the world crises.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]  Bringing them terrorism.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]  So we will accept a highly dictatorial police state regime.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]  It is happening.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]  The world is a changing.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]  And they are telling you to give up your liberty for security.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]  I haven't even hit the tip of the iceberg.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]  But we are going to get through more of this today.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000]  The good news is I got a call yesterday from a statesman writer.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]  Erin Walter.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]  It is a lady.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]  And she says yes Alex.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]  I have seen your shows.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]  Your TV shows.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]  You do predict there will be a government bombing.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]  You did predict New York City.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]  You did predict that all of this would happen.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]  You said they would call for a loss of our civil liberties.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]  They are doing that.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]  She said I am concerned.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]  I have heard a story about the government planning this in 62.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]  And Kennedy saying no.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]  I can't believe it.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]  They are getting reports that there were bombs in the bottoms of those buildings.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]  That is all that could bring them down like that in five seconds a piece.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]  She said she was going to try to put all of my quotes in there.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]  But it is obvious that Richard Opel did his job and cut them all out.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]  But I am in the paper today.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]  And it is good news that folks are buying guns in record numbers.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]  After attacks weapons become a hot commodity.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]  Gun shops report swift sales.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]  Other stores say it is business as usual.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]  Gas mask guns and ammunition were
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]  stashed off the shelves of some of the stores.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]  After Tuesday mornings terrorists attacked as people who feared the worst
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]  prepared to defend themselves.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]  People are stockpiling ammunition.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]  Said Robert Key of Just Guns of South Congress Avenue.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]  I am calling the distributors.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]  The distributors are calling the manufacturers.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]  The manufacturers are saying we are out.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]  We are going to run out of ammunition in a couple of days if not sooner.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]  Ed Nutting of General Manager of Banana Bay Trading Co. in Central Austin said
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]  there was a high demand for gas masks.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]  We are getting calls from people across the state saying hold two or three for me.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]  Nutting said at noon.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]  McBride's gun said it sold out of shotguns and some ammunition.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]  Reds indoor range also had an increase in shotgun sales.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]  Alex Jones host of an access television show.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]  They know I am syndicated to 100 stations.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]  Radio.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]  Said guns represent freedom.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]  And he and many of his listeners are worried that Americans will lose
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]  civil liberties as the government tries to crack down on terrorism.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:03.000]  Americans are taking a lesson from Israel where they have a lot of these terrorist events.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]  They are going out and arming themselves to defend their families.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]  Jones said we should support local government but we should peaceably resist
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]  if they start running checkpoints and pulling people out of their cars
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:21.000]  and treating them like third world serfs.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]  And the article goes on with more.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000]  That is the statesman front page of the Metro and State today.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]  Alright that is the basics on that.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000]  You see the statesman writers, the people out there have seen me say this for years.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]  You know my spiel.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]  You know the documents.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]  I have shown the feds blowing up Oklahoma City.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]  I have shown the newscast.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]  The unexploded bombs being removed.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]  I have shown you the evidence.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]  I have taught you about the Hegelian dialectic.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]  I told you this would happen.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000]  Three weeks ago I predicted it again in a two hour show that re-aired today.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]  And morons called our comment line, the vast minority,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]  and said how dare you be anti-American.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]  We will kill you.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000]  We need to bomb them sand bleepers.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]  They said another word.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]  Sand niggers.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]  I don't agree with calling those people that.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]  They may call us the great Satan because our government is corrupt
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]  just like their government is corrupt.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]  They may be jealous of our money and our power that was built out of our free market
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]  that is now being stolen from us by the new world order.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]  But 99.9% of the people over there are innocent and we don't even know what country did it.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000]  It's probably going to be Iran.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:42.000]  And Iran announced two weeks ago, by the way we have nukes pointed at Israel long range.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000]  China is partners and allies with Iran and has nuclear engineers there.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]  The secrets we gave China have now been given to Iran.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]  And when I say we, I'm not talking about the American people.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]  So are we going to give up our liberty for security?
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]  That is the question.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]  Our forefathers fought and died.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]  The military will tell you they fight to maintain our open society, our freedom.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]  Giving up your rights isn't going to keep you safe.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]  The government opened the borders.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]  The government is announcing getting rid of the borders.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]  The government gave the Chinese military the Panama Canal.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]  Let them move missiles back into Cuba.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]  Gave them former naval bases in the Bahamas.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]  This is on the news.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000]  But that's not a threat is it when they're threatening to nuke us in their own newspapers over Taiwan.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]  And what's going to happen if we get into the Middle East War?
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]  China is going to invade Taiwan in the middle of all this.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]  This is a smoke screen for a world government realignment.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]  Why are the Russians building the biggest underground base ever seen under the Ural Mountains?
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000]  Why are they rolling out new Topolim missiles?
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]  Only the new world order to consolidate power.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]  We're hearing this term.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]  The world stands together under the UN against terrorism.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]  We must give up our rights to the world government.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]  You've been hearing them.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:12.000]  You've been seeing Henry Kissinger saying we must get over this outdated, old-fashioned, stupid moral argument of liberties and give up our liberties.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]  Who stands to gain from these bombings?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]  And how long have I predicted this?
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]  Let's take about ten calls.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]  Then we're going to break and air some footage from Oklahoma City.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]  Mike, do you have Oklahoma cover up?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]  Do you have Oklahoma cover up?
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:35.000]  Cue it up to the newscast.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]  Okay, you want me to recap.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]  People want me to recap.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:51.000]  90% chance the U.S. government did this using outside EU European Union funding to hire these terrorist groups to do this.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000]  Or to use Muslim extremist fundamentalist front men.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000]  Look at the motives.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]  Who stands to gain?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]  The government.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000]  They're now saying give up your rights, accept centralized control, accept a centralized emergency.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]  They're telling you it's going to get worse.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]  This is only the beginning.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]  They're talking about an all-out war in the Middle East.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]  China will assuredly invade Taiwan.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]  They've been threatening to nuke us.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000]  But they're our friends in the media while they move into the Panama Canal and we don't even fight them to keep it.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]  Our borders are wide open.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]  The government's done everything they could to make us wide open to this.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000]  We know these terrorists came through from Canada.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]  The buildings were brought down.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:41.000]  The designer of the World Trade Center is in the Chicago Tribune at Infowars.com right now saying that that was impossible what happened.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000]  The building could have fallen over but not straight down and not both of them.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]  Only shape charges could do that.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]  I've had structural engineers on my show.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]  They're claiming the weight of all those floors collapsing could do it.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]  Bull.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:08.000]  We know that Delta Force was launched confirmed from Fort Bragg at 7 o'clock eastern an hour and 40 minutes before the first plane slammed in and we're flying towards Washington.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]  What do they tell Delta Force?
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000]  They get them deployed and then blow up these buildings so they don't fall over and hurt other buildings?
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]  I don't know.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]  But I know this.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]  The feds blew up Oklahoma City.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]  The former head of the FBI Crime Lab is headed on my radio show.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]  The former head of Air Force Weapons Development is headed on my radio show.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]  We're now airing those interviews here on ACCESS.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]  The audio of them.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]  You see them every day.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]  Thanks to Marion who's doing a good job airing them.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]  They really straighten stuff up around here.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000]  The former head of the FBI Crime Lab will tell you the feds did it.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000]  And then I got the Baltimore Sun right here.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000]  Give me another close shot please, Mike.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:58.000]  New book on NSA sheds light on a secret U.S. terror plan called Cuban Invasion Pretext.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]  Baltimore Sun.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]  It says casualty list.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]  That's a list of dead people.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]  This is a Pentagon document released now.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]  Casualty list in U.S. newspapers could cause a helpful wave of indignation.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]  We could blow up passenger airliners.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000]  We could blow up John Glenn's spacecraft on liftoff and blame it on Fidel.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.000]  We could attack the Marines at Guantanamo Bay using U.S. Army dressed up as Cuban nationals.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]  These are confirmed.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]  Everybody signed off on it but Kennedy.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]  And he came out and gave public statements at universities.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]  I'm pulling us out of Vietnam.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]  I'm abolishing the CIA.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]  I'm issuing Lincoln Greenbacks and abolishing the Federal Reserve.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]  He only got four billion of them printed.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]  His head was blown off.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]  Kennedy may have been corrupt but he was a real man.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:54.000]  He wasn't into blowing up airliners and targeting Washington for bombings.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]  This is what it's all about.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]  How do they get you to circle the wagons?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]  How do they get the feds to circle the wagons against the American people?
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000]  They blew up a federal building.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]  Then they got their police state mechanism in.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]  Now they attack the whole country.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:15.000]  Get the people behind giving up our rights and having a huge costly war with probably innocent parties.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]  I know it feels good to hate the Arabs.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]  I grew up hating their guts.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]  I grew up talking trash about them because of this controlled media.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000]  This police state media that puts cancer viruses in your children's vaccines.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]  That feeds them Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.000]  BBC now reports twice as strong as cocaine that puts toxins in the water supply.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000]  It's telling you that a bunch of people that live in mud huts are your enemy.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]  Give me a break.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]  It feels good though, doesn't it?
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000]  You know if Saddam did this, nuking.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]  What Arab government would want to do this?
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]  Who really stands to gain?
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]  The EU currency rolling out?
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]  Already trading against the dollar?
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]  Our financial center destroyed?
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000]  13 of the 15 EU government is run by known communists.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]  Gerard Schroeder admits he's a communist.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]  Tony Blair a socialist.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]  Lionel Jospin of France.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000]  They announced a war with the US on Monday saying you're going to crash.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]  We're number one.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]  It's on my site mainstream.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]  Go there.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]  Global news wires.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]  Alright, I promise we take calls.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]  Bottom line, they're saying give up your freedom for security.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]  When they got the borders open.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000]  When they got the Chinese military threatening to nuke us in the People's Daily newspaper.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]  You heard about that on the news.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]  Saying we'll kill 200 million Americans if you get involved in Taiwan.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]  We go, okay, here's more missile secrets.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000]  Oh, give them to Iran.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000]  Go ahead.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000]  We arm China.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000]  That's the globalists.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000]  Not us.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000]  Gotta get out of we.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000]  The great Satan.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]  How's that?
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]  The CFR Federal Reserve that's destroyed this country.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]  Let's go ahead and use the Arabs term for it.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]  The great Satan arms China.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000]  The great Lucifer.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000]  And the great Lucifer arms the great demon of Iran.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000]  And the great demon of Iran.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]  The great demon of Iran wallowing amongst all this.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]  Was making deals with Ronald Reagan to hold the hostages.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]  So Jimmy Carter got kicked out.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]  They work with us.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000]  Not us.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000]  But the great Satan.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]  They're all together.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]  I tell the Muslims out there.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]  You're leaders of the great Satan too.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]  They go meet at the UN.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]  Go ahead and put a fatwa out on me.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]  I'm not scared of you.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]  You're all working for the great Satan.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]  And I've got the evidence.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]  You're all connected.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000]  You start looking at it.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]  God, it's just sick.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]  Osama bin Laden, MSNBC.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]  Give me a close shot.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]  Please.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]  CIA asset.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]  CIA asset.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000]  CIA asset.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]  MSNBC, 1998.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]  On Infowars.com.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000]  Well, hello, folks.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000]  It's Mike Hanson.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:04.000]  I'm sorry to interrupt your viewing here on YouTube.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.000]  What we're trying to do is get all these VHS tapes
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]  before they go bad.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]  If you see right here, they're already starting to go bad.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000]  So we're doing the best we can to get these thousands of tapes
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000]  up on YouTube before they completely go bad,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]  which they are pretty well going bad already.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]  You see how it flicked.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]  I'm live on the air.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000]  You see how it's starting to mess up at the bottom
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]  and flicker every once in a while.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]  That means they're getting really, really old.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000]  So what we're doing is we've hired some people.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000]  We've got a bunch of expensive equipment,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000]  and we're getting them uploaded to either Mike Hanson Archives.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:05.000]  Be sure to subscribe to Mike Hanson Archives, Hanson Archives,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:13.000]  Waco Archives, or the newest one, Trailer Park Show Archives.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:21.000]  And if you would like to contribute $25 for this effort,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]  I will send you a copy of my book that I wrote,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]  Bohemia Grove, Cult of Conspiracy.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000]  Just, if you can see that,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000]  send it to 901 St. Joseph Street,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000]  Gonzales, Texas, 78629.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.000]  Or you can call us and leave a message
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000]  and somebody will call you back and get your credit card
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000]  and we'll send you a signed copy out there.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000]  830-672-3089.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:09.000]  So we'll get right back to either Jeff Davis, Alex Jones, Steve Lane,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000]  whoever's on right now from 25 years ago.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000]  We're trying to, I think it's a good effort to try to save this history.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000]  This is history, folks.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000]  You know, where are you going to see this again from, from 95?
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:35.000]  I was the producer for Jeff Davis and Alex Jones for 15 years,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.000]  from 1995 to 2010, and we have a lot of tapes.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]  I know Alex had a lot of tapes, but he left them out in the garage or something
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]  and they completely ruined it.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000]  So getting this history up, I think, is very important.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]  And I'm making it a goal in my life.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]  Hopefully, somebody said,
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000]  that's going to take you 20 years to get all that stuff.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]  Well, no, if we can get a little donations,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.000]  we can go ahead and hire some more people and get it up faster.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000]  But the tapes are deteriorating very quickly,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]  as you can see every once in a while right here.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000]  That means these VHS tapes, these old VHS, if you're young,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]  you probably don't even know what these VHS tapes are.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:35.000]  But, you know, you got to keep them in a cool place and a clean place.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000]  Some of them are very dirty.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]  So we're trying to get them up.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000]  All right.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]  Thanks a lot and God bless, folks.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:51.000]  And call us and help us if you can.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]  Now here's Alex.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000]  You know, they could have taken this guy out.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000]  Instead, they bought an Aspen factory that supplies half of Africa
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]  with basic necessities.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000]  It's a big sick joke, but CNN can go interview bin Laden,
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000]  but we can't kill him.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]  Wake up, folks.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000]  We're wide open to real attack, but they're telling us give up our freedoms.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]  Let's take some calls.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000]  The FBI is behind this, know that.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]  Hello, caller on the air.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000]  Hold on a second.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000]  Could you come turn her up, Mike?
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000]  Thanks.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000]  Go ahead, ma'am.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]  I was watching everything yesterday on the news, all day,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]  back and forth through all the different reports.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000]  And I did hear, I heard people and I heard the reporters saying that
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]  they heard bombs going off at the World Trade Center
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000]  right before those buildings went or the first building went.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000]  Look, we have the footage coming to us, and Jeff Ward reported it yesterday.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]  He saw it.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000]  On NBC reporters out there, you know, at 920 or whatever,
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000]  when the first South Tower collapses, she's out there on the mic,
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000]  and she goes boom, and explosion.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000]  He said boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]  And she's, oh, I saw it.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000]  Others saw it.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]  I shouldn't have it.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000]  I wasn't taping that channel.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000]  I was on other TV.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000]  I mean, those buildings went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and just
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]  perfectly down.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]  And the inventor, the builder, the designer of the,
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]  says that's impossible what happened.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000]  It was built to take a jumbo jet hit.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]  Well, what I don't understand, and maybe you can help me with this,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:33.000]  is if they did put those bombs in, which I do believe they did, why?
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000]  What was the purpose of that?
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]  Was the purpose so that the buildings didn't topple over and kill,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]  you know, several thousand people?
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000]  No, it's to kill more.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000]  They would tell the Delta Force who was dispatched to the scene,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000]  who ran the stuff in Seattle.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000]  Have you seen the Delta Force running provocateurs in Seattle?
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000]  You've seen me air that, putting 500 people in a FEMA camp?
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]  Did you ever see that footage?
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000]  No, no, I didn't.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000]  It's my film, The Takeover.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]  They would tell Delta Force, gentlemen, go to the scene,
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]  blow up these buildings so they don't topple and hurt people,
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]  and they'll follow orders.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000]  You know what the Delta Force's final exam is?
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000]  What?
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000]  They have to read Machiavelli, the Prince, Machiavellian politics,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000]  the Injustifies, the Means, the Art of Suffrage,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000]  and they have to agree with Machiavelli in a ten-page report,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000]  and they have like three or four hours to read it and write the report.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]  Well, you know, there were other,
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.000]  I had seen other reporters were getting cut off when they were saying things.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000]  Oh, I know.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]  I saw them on tape saying other bombs,
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000]  and then suddenly they cut off or saying, you know, the, guess what?
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000]  Again, the Secret Service had offices in that building.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000]  You know, they're in financial stuff.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000]  They had their New York offices in that building
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000]  for counterfeiting and financial crimes.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000]  And guess what happened?
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000]  What?
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]  They were all out of the building.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]  They were told not to come to work that day.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000]  Of course they were.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000]  Just like Oklahoma City with the BATF all out of the building.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000]  Well, they were going on and on about this car bomb outside the State Building,
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]  which just automatically disappeared.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]  We never heard more about that.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000]  Well, do you see who stands to gain from all of this?
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000]  Yes, I do.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]  Can we boost her, guys?
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]  Do you see who stands to gain from all this?
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]  Yes, I do.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000]  It's the government.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]  It's what you're saying, the New World Order.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]  How long have you watched my show?
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]  About maybe about nine months.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000]  Okay, how many times did you hear me say this was going to happen
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000]  and did I show you news stories of them planning this?
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.000]  Well, I was looking for it on your website because yesterday when this all happened,
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000]  I had been watching, I had been watching the Today Show,
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]  and I saw that they came on about the first plane hitting.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]  And the first thing, I was on the phone with a neighbor
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000]  and the first thing I said was, this is a terrorist attack.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]  And she said, no, no, no, it can't be.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000]  I said, no, planes just don't fly into the World Trade Center.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000]  And then all of a sudden I remembered, and am I crazy or did you write about this
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000]  or talk about this, that there was going to be something happening
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000]  with the World Trade Center in New York?
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000]  Yes, I did.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000]  Okay, because I went and looked for it yesterday on the website
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000]  just to back it up to everyone that I had been telling this over and over to,
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]  and I couldn't find it.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000]  Well, the site is too massive.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]  Updated with over 100 stories each day.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000]  It's in the archives, just like this MSNBC bin Laden terrorist story is.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]  And that's why it's so stressful for me.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]  Let me show you that story again.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000]  That's why this is all stressful for me here on this show.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000]  What I said was, about five months ago, the second episode of Lone Gunman.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]  Right.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000]  And we have that tape being brought to us as we speak by a viewer.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000]  It's the secret government wants martial law, so they take control of a plane
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000]  and they pilot it in remote control, and at the last minute they stop it,
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.000]  they were going to ram a 747 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000]  Now this was that X-Files show, wasn't it?
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:15.000]  Yes, so what I said was, generally when they show genetically modified crops
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]  getting into other crops on the X-Files, they say aliens are doing it.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000]  No, it's called Monsanto's.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000]  But it's part of subconsciously preparing you for biological catastrophe
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000]  because of Monsanto's now spreading into all the food.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000]  When they have a movie like The Skulls, about the skull and bones at Yale,
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000]  I'm talking about it eight years ago, the movie comes out,
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000]  now you're desensitized and I'm just talking about a movie.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000]  You understand?
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000]  Right.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000]  Long before they released black helicopters on us in urban warfare training.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000]  You heard about them burning the police stations in South Texas?
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000]  Well, I watched that on your show.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000]  And I interviewed the police chief of San Antonio throwing them out and calling?
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000]  Absolutely.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]  Okay, I just want to know you saw that and that was documented.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]  Okay, here's the point.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000]  Before they ever released urban warfare training and military checkpoints in the country,
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  gearing them up for this now, incrementally training cops that it's normal,
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  all the urban warfare training, they told us people that say black helicopters exist are dangerous terrorists.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Then they hit and burned buildings from San Antonio to Kingsville.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  It's in the front page of the paper.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  Alex Jones is right, but he's still a kook as buildings are on fire.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  So they precondition you.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  Same thing.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  When I saw that lone gunman, I said, look for an attack on the Trade Center.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  They've already bombed the Trade Center once.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  The FBI trained the bombers in 93.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  That was in the New York Times, October 28, 93.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  The FBI was recorded admitting it in a meeting by a disgruntled employee.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  They had to admit it and apologize.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  It was swept under the rug.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  That was a government bombing.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  So I said the World Trade Center is a prime target months ago.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  I know I remembered something with that.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  Look, I know how they operate, ma'am.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  I know how evil they are.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  Once you've watched them long enough, you understand their paradigm.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  Once you're outside the rat maze, you understand where they're going to go.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  I mean, I understand a spectrum.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  I know what's going to happen in a certain genre.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  I don't know when it's going to happen or exactly how it's going to happen.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  I know what prime targets are.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  I know what they're pushing for.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  I know what they're doing.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  In this spectrum, in this area that I'm able to see, it's not exact what's going to happen.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  I know it's in this area.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  Well, I want to hear your take on this hijacking.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  Because personally, if there were three guys with box cutters standing in front of me,
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  hijacking a plane, I mean, what would it be for everybody in the plane to take their shoes off
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  and bomb them with their shoes, for God's sakes, you know?
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  I want to know, what do you think about that?
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  What's up with the knife?
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Well, I'll answer your question for you.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  I've had a knife pulled on me in Dallas growing up.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  Thank you, sir.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  Go ahead and get it ready, Mike.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  Get the long gunman ready.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  We appreciate it.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  Come on in.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  Come on in here for a second.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  Hold on just a second.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  Man, that's obvious BS.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  People would have taken those guys on.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  What we're being told in the media is not accurate.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  What's your name, sir?
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  Come on in here.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  You brought us the long gunman?
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  Yes, this is from my neighbor, actually.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  You've been watching the show, sir?
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  No, I've been at work.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  I mean, in the past.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  Yeah, about the reports and stuff.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  Have you ever watched this TV show before?
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  This TV show?
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  No, sir.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  I haven't.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  On the air.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Well, we've been predicting for five years this would happen.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  Wow.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  He doesn't want to be on TV, Mike.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  Well, thank you so much, sir, for bringing it.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  All right, here we go, Mike.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  Here's the long gunman.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  Cue it up.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  It's at the end of the show.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  They're going to blow up the World Trade Center.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  I hope this is SP Speed.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  God bless you, sir.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Here you go, Mike.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  I guess Mike Moore brought that up.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  I didn't bring it.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  So, Mike, thanks.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  Ma'am, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  People just came in the studio.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  I've had somebody pull a knife on me, and I had no choice.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  I had to take them on.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Now, even with the double-edged dagger that I was taking on, it's actually happened twice
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  in my life, once here and once at another place, even dealing with somebody with a knife,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  I was able to take them on.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  But with box cutters, you're just going to get a little cut.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  And, you know, school teachers charge people that have guns.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  Are you still there?
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  That's my point.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  I just don't get this.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  No, no, I don't buy it for a single second.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  They may have even put, you know, Arab terrorists who were mind-control subjects in those cockpits.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  Well, the thing is that yesterday I was thinking, okay, well, then they had plants at the airport
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  to let these people in.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  And then today when I find out, you know, that they're box cutters, what do you think
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  about these people then that called from the plane?
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  I mean, that mother today, you know, on TV this morning saying she got that call from
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  her son, I mean, that seemed pretty credible to me.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  I mean, you know, she broke my heart.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  And her son had said to her that they were claiming they had a bomb.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  I didn't hear her say anything about knives.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  She was saying that her son said they have a bomb, we're going to die anyway.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Well, the former Solicitor General's wife was on board supposing called by cell phone
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  and said they had box cutters.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  Callers, let's move through these.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  Go ahead.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment and say that one thing we can do, I guess, is just to sit
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  back and watch now and, you know, in my opinion, I ask people this question.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  I say, because this happened, let me ask you a question.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Do we need a new law because this happened?
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  And I think, of course, the answer is no.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  And I just want to sit back and watch and see who comes forth and proposes, of course,
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  it's not like they need more laws or more regulations to tighten the noose.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  They have enough already.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  But I want to see who offers further legislation in the name of this crisis.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  Well, the Gallup poll and I appreciate your calls are excellent points.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  The Gallup poll has been out.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  And about 80 percent of Americans don't want any new laws, don't want to lose their liberties.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  They know that our forefathers in these wars fought to maintain our freedoms and our open
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  society.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  And they know that the government hasn't done the first fixes they could of locking down
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  the border permanently.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  That's constitutional, militarizing the border.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  They've given the Chinese military the Panama Canal and allowed them to encircle us while
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  they're threatening to nuke us.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  I mean, this stuff just goes on and on.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  But the pundits are sure on TV saying we should give up our rights.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  See, that's why they did this, just like the Baltimore Sun says, as a pretext for control.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  Hello, caller on the air.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  I'm going to have to put them on hold.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  Now the audio is so loud it's blowing me out of here, guys.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  Can you turn that down?
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  Okay, can you turn that down a little bit for me?
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  At the box in here?
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  I don't know.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  Thanks, Mike.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  I'm sorry, sir.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  Go ahead.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  Two things.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  One, I just wanted to confer your statements about the Israeli government.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  I, through my own experiences five years ago, have seen kind of like the ugly side of them
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  because they do treat Palestinians, especially the farmers, like crap because there's this
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  one gentleman I knew of, not a trade farmer.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  And they, for some reason, what they decided to do since people were hiding behind trees
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  throwing rocks at soldiers, they decided to tear his trees down, saying they were used,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  you know, against the military.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  And then they tore them down.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  The man decided to plant them back.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  When he did, he was arrested by the government for, you know, treacherous actions against
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  the State of Israel.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  Tell you what, let me put you on hold.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  Can you guys boost this audio again now?
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  Now I've lost him.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  This box is going bad.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  I don't know why it hasn't been replaced.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  Now you know why we have a lot of mistakes here on Axis Television.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  You've been watching the national news.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  Yesterday they've been having even more screw ups than we are right now.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  All I can say is this.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  I'm no fan of the Arabs.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  They're very terroristic.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  They're very stubborn.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  They think we're all their enemies.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  And they are behind a lot of these events.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  But bin Laden is a known CIA asset.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  Bottom line, we have to talk about that.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  It's an MSNBC.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  It's a known historical fact.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  He was armed and created by this government and his family is still allowed to build
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  our military bases in the Middle East.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  Now that's not a security threat for the richest family in Saudi Arabia next to King Fahd's family.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  He's now dead.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  Who stands to gain from all of this?
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  But yes, Israel is conducting a Nazi attack on the Palestinian people.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  I have video of them killing women, killing children, bulldozing people's houses,
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  taking and killing their tomato plants, taking their buckets they use to collect rainwater.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  And all my life I was raised to hate the Arabs, hate the Arabs.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  And then last night Sharon moves in with tanks and starts slaughtering all the stuff going on there.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  The government allowed this to happen, let the terrorists do this or did it themselves
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  so Israel can be nice and safe and do whatever they want and kill everybody for labors trial.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  You know Hitler said living space.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  I don't like out off Hitler.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  I protested the Klan.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  And I don't like what Israel does calling the Palestinians goyim, subhuman.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  And I'll tell you right now Iran's run by the great Satan too.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  It's all these world governments.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  They're really on the same team to suppress and oppress the people.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  I mean here's the evidence.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  I mean we've made deals with Iran, Oliver North, the rest of them.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  Clinton's given them weapons.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  Clinton gave them a bunch of weapons to help out in attacking Serbia.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  Serbia saved our airmen and our soldiers by the thousands of World War II.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  They're being attacked by the Muslims.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  What do we do?
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  We go bomb them and let the ethnic Albanians take over so the IMF and World Bank can get all that ore and oil out of Kosovo.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  We're attacking our own allies.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  Serbia was always on our side.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  There were no mass graves.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Clinton lied to you like he did on everything else.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  See all the sides you think are really there, it's all smoke and mirrors.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  And now people are calling for total all-out war and total all-out covert war.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  Getting rid of the log and assassinating foreign leaders.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  And you're going to raise an even bigger generation of Osama bin Laden's who are going to nuke this country.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  We're going to go over there and kill innocent people.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  Imagine not having water, not having power for 11 years.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  Imagine being bombed every week or every month.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  That's what the people of Iraq have been living under.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  Do I like Saddam Hussein, an evil bastard?
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  Saddam Hussein, watch your history channel, was put into power in 1974.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  1975 by the Ba'ath Party, created by the Central Intelligence Agency to take over Iraq, to kill the Shiites,
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  and then to move in against Iran in an eight-year war in the 1980s and a 1990 April glass be five days before the invasion of Kuwait
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  told Saddam Hussein on videotape, go ahead and invade Kuwait, we don't get involved in inner Arab affairs.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  See, I know too much information.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  So we create Saddam, put him in power.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  We create bin Laden and put him in power.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  We will wind up toys to suppress their populations.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  Oh, my neck hurts, man.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  I tell you, I'm so stressed from all this.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  I've got knots all in my back.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  I'm on the radio for like 10 hours a day, normally on six hours a day.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Mike gave me a nice shot of the building blowing up and collapsing, falling in only six seconds.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  So I could pop my neck.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  There you go.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  There you go.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  They're getting more sophisticated than Oklahoma City.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  That baby coming down from the bottom up, pieces of the unstable top falling as it went.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  That a big enough spectacle for you, ladies and gentlemen, full of people, at least 30,000 dead when the numbers come out.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  So they've got our borders wide open.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  They've got China threatening to nuke us in their own newspapers, taking over the Panama Canal, moving into Cuba.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  They're high provocateurs for all these anti-globalization protests who go out and stir up a fight
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  so the military can attack the peaceful demonstrators.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  Chuckie Schumer was seen last night.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  He was in CBS.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  And there's the Senate in the House singing God Bless America.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  And Chuckie efforts laughing and clapping and going.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  You can't hear his audio, but he's sitting there talking to Tom Daschle.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  And Tom Daschle is going.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  They're like they're lovers or something.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  And they're going.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  They're just hugging and going.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  And Chuckie Schumer goes, I got it on tape.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  It's like on the 10 hours we got Mike Scott in there.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  We didn't have time to find it all.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  You'll have it in the future.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  You'll have Chuckie Schumer going.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  I mean, literally, just, I mean, I don't want to exaggerate.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  This is what Chuckie Schumer is doing.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  And Daschle is going.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  And they're going.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  Looks like that famous picture of Hitler, Mussolini, Herman Goering as they sign over Czechoslovakia
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  and Poland with the Russians.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  And Hitler's going.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  And Mussolini's going.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  You know, Hitler just didn't blow up the Reichstag when he got elected chancellor to then abolish the presidency
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  and declare himself the Fuhrer ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer, für Lebensraum, for living space.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  Horrible.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  He also, before they invaded and broke their deal with Russia,
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  they attacked a German radio command and killed about 30 soldiers.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  And later it came out they actually killed their own soldiers.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  We have been attacked by the Polish.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  Move in.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  You know how old this is?
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  There's an essay on my website with historical notes
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  with dozens of examples of problem reaction solution confirmed throughout history.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  And I keep predicting this.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  I keep telling you, number one suspects are government and the EU using Muslim Front people.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Look at the sophistication, folks.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  Let's go back to that caller.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  Go ahead, caller.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  Hey, Alex.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  Yes.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Just to finish up on that first statement, like I said, I can, you know, get the information together.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  I can, you know, send you an email about the specifics on that.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  And also the other stereotype is not all people who are Arab, you know, Palestinian, Lebanese, whatever, are Muslims.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  A good number of them are Christians.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  About a third of them are Christians.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  Yeah.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  And I just, all I have to say is for people just don't have a blind eye towards the Israeli government, that's all.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  No, the Israeli government should be able to call the Palestinians goyim.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  Women and children and blow little kids genitalia is off on national news because it's it's it's their right for more living space.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  It's labor and Stroud.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  But also my point is Israel is going to get us nuked.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  And the other thing I mentioned to your producer was earlier this morning at work,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  I saw they had all for North on TV going on about how these quote terrorists used common on like a knife.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  I have a common pocket tool as weapons to take over the airliners.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  And it just sounds like, well, here's another thing is rolling down.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  Now we need to ban knives.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  I wonder why he made deals to sell tow missiles and missile components to the Iranians.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  Yeah, I found out.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  And why are the Iranians working with the great Satan?
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  You understand these Arab governments are just as corrupt.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  Yeah, but that's all I have to say.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  Do you understand that?
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  I definitely do.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  You understand that we should retaliate against whoever did this with the same time.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  I'm telling you at the bare minimum, our government allowed this to happen.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  By their policies, opening up the borders, letting us become completely encircled.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  Just last week, Bush is getting rid of the southern border.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  Yeah, that's a great idea, Bush.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  And the northern border.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  Appreciate your call, sir.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  Understand, I'm pro-American.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  That's why we're fighting for our rights.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  Your freedoms are in the crosshairs because of this.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  They're saying you got to give up your freedoms.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  Bull!
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  Go ahead, caller.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  Hello?
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  Yes.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  Yes, I want to make a comment about Israel.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  And I will try to remain calm because I feel like you take what is happening today and disregard what has happened since Israel became a nation.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  And things have happened.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  Israel does not want to go to war.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  They wanted peace with the Palestinians.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  But they were attacked and attacked and attacked.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  And every time they had to fight back and got rule of the land, which they did not want to keep.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  It was only for security reasons.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  Because why keep more land?
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  I mean, it's just a burden to keep up more land.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  All they wanted was security, security.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  They have given it back in 1956.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  They want again.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  Ma'am, ma'am, hold on, hold on.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  See, we can't debate one little part of this.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  I'll put you on hold.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  I'll talk to you later, but you got to let me talk.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  Osama bin Laden is a CIA asset.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  Oliver North and Reagan armed Iran.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  Clinton paid off Iran to help us take over.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Us, not us, the New World Order.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  Kosovo, one third of Serbia with a hundred plus billion dollars of ore and minerals.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  And then Senator Inhofe went over there and all he saw was piles of dead Serb soldiers and blown up school buses.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  But you bought that, didn't you?
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  I bet you did.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  The little Muslims were our friends then.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  My point is this thing is all interchanged.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  Look for them to not even find out who did this or to bomb another Aspen factory.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  Because this government armed China with the newest nuclear weapons designs and delivery systems.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  And they have now armed Iran.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  And Russia has armed Syria.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  And we can't even bomb those countries now.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  We're in a stalemate.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  And there's going to be more bombings and more bombings and more bombings.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  They're going to wring their hands and something must be done.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  And they're going to say we got to give up our rights.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  My point is I have video of Arab women, Palestinian women, begging for their little rock house that's getting bulldozed.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  As Israeli soldiers strut around in black uniforms beating people up and taking their tomatoes and breaking their water jugs.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  Now those people aren't a threat.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  You want to rocket Yasser Arafat who's a pedophile.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  That's well known.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  Go ahead.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  That worm.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  But don't sit there.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  You know I'm just sick of the Israeli government has its Israel lobby in the Senate, in the House.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  They want our guns.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  They're all voting to disarm us.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  While funding, America paid for M16s for Israel.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  You want to end these hijackings?
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  In the 80s there was a call to put iron bulkheads between the pilot and the rest of the plane.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  There was a call to put guns on board.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  And I heard local radio saying oh no guns, oh no guns.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  They have guns.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  They have bullets you can buy at the store that don't even go through that thick of metal or plastic.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  They go into body flesh.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  They explode.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  They won't even shoot through a plane.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  I've bought them and shot stuff with them.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  They've got a thin metal casing and they're plastic.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  And they'll blow a hole in you that big into your flesh.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  They send a shockwave.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  They should arm the pilots now.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  Until 1949 our pilots were armed with revolvers because they carried U.S. mail.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  And up until 1940s our mailmen carried guns.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  Back when we didn't have crimes and a rape or murder was national news, everybody had guns.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  The law abiding citizens had guns.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  If those pilots had guns, if one train flight attendant had a gun, they'd have been able to take them out.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  Oh, but a child might get hurt.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  Yeah, now you've got 30,000 dead people because of box cutters.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  Now I'm not attacking Israel outright.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  I know that there are a lot of good Palestinians, a lot of good Jews on both sides that are trying to come together.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.000]  But I've seen them call Sharon, when he was a general, bombed the USS Liberty.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  And as our men were in the water, they strafed them on purpose.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  And LBJ and 63 didn't help them.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  And everybody else is seen as dogs, as slaves by Israel.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  They call the Palestinians goyim.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  Look in your dictionary.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  I don't like Adolf Hitler calling Jews subhuman.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  And I don't like Mecha calling whites subhuman.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  And I don't like any of these racists.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  And I'm telling you, Israel acts more like the Nazis every day.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  And so do the Arabs, okay?
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  They're not going to sit here while we bomb Iraq for 11 years and go, yeah, give them Arabs something.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  When a million Iraqis have starved to death, no medicine, no clean water, no electricity.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  How would you like it when we put Saddam in power and gave him the chemical weapons to hit those Kurds
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  and to fight the Iranians?
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  The government created all of this, and they stand to gain from this.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  Did you hear me when I read the MSNBC bin Laden CIA asset?
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  Or when I read Baltimore Sun?
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  New book on NSA sheds light on secret U.S. terror plan called Cuban invasion pretext.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  Washington, U.S. military leaders proposal 62, a secret plan to commit terrorist acts against Americans
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  and blame Cuba to create a pretext, an excuse, for invasion and the ouster of communist leader Fidel Castro.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  I hate Castro.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  You don't become Castro to fighting, according to a new book by the National Security Agency.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  And it is confirmed with the documents.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  We could develop a communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area and other Florida cities, even in Washington.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  Bomb Washington, said one document prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  We could blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba, the document says.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  And the U.S. newspapers could cause a helpful wave of indignation.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  The plan is laid out in documents signed by the five Joint Chiefs of Staff, but never carried out.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  President Kennedy nixed the program.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  According to writer James Bamford and Body of Secrets, the new history of Fort Meade's based eavesdropping agency
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  is being released today by Doubleday.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  This was April 24th.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  I read it every week to you.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  And it says, former ABC executive, now best-selling author, retired.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  He has the NSA documents where Israel attacked and said kill all of our soldiers.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000]  It also says we could sink a boatload of Cubans en route from Florida.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  We could foster attempts on the lives of Cubans in the United States, even an extent of wounding and killing.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  We could blow up John Glenn's spacecraft in 62 as it goes into orbit and blame it on the Cubans.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  We could blow up passenger airliners.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  It's called Operation Northwoods.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  This is the stuff that somebody at the NSA leaked, warning you back in April to the Washington Times,
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  to the New York Times, to the New York Post, to the Baltimore Sun.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  Bamford sent me copies.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  He has it from the Library of Congress, the actual minutes.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  Casualty list would be extremely helpful.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  Let's show them those buildings collapsing some more, guys.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  Then you have Oklahoma City being a government bombing.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000]  We're going to take some more calls.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  Then I'm going to air Oklahoma City segment.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  We're going to come back and recap all of this.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  Call your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  You should be calling talk radio shows.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  You should be calling Congress, the governor, the president, saying we know who stands to gain the government.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  We know you left our country wide open to terrorist attack by lowering our borders north and south,
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  by letting the Chinese military move into Panama, by giving the Chinese military the latest nuclear weapons,
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  which they've now given with the delivery systems to Iran.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  See, we can't attack Iran now.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  They got nukes, folks.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  You ready for nuclear war?
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  It's sitting there in your easy chair drinking your beer and burping and scratching your butt,
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  feeling real tough right now.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  Kill them damn Arabs.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Will you just go ahead and bomb the Arabs and watch New York disappear with a nuke?
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  The truth is your fat, stupid couch potatoes that have bought this lie
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  and think you can give up your liberty for security
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  by a bunch of sicko New World Order freaks that created Saddam
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  and created bin Laden and are laughing at you right now and stampeding you into this.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  I don't want to hear turn the medallion to a parking lot anymore.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  This isn't about mindless emotionalism.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  Kill them Arabs.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  Sure, kill a million of them if they were involved in it.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  Imagine America being bombed for 11 years, being surrounded,
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  not having any water, food or no medicine shipped in.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  The U.N. running everything.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  That's what Iraq is.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  And they could have taken Saddam out in 91,
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  but instead they've turned Iraq into a desert, which it was 80 years ago.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  Their population has quadrupled in the last 60 years.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  They were desert.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  With that oil money, they built colleges and schools and built themselves up
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  and were buddies with the U.S. and attacked the Iranians and did their job
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  and followed orders from George Bush, the former CIA director.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  And then when Saddam did his job and invaded Kuwait when he was ordered to,
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  April Glassby, U.S. ambassador on tape, saying let it go forward.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  You saw it on the news.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  They attacked him and now the U.N. runs it.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  Why didn't we take Saddam out?
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  Because it's about killing people.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  It's about U.N. population control and the U.N. taking control of that oil.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  And they needed Saddam there as the boogeyman so we could encircle them
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  and steal their oil for the U.N.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  And now the U.N. wants a Tobin tax of 1.5 trillion a year to fund their world government.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  And they're admitting we're under world government and losing our national sovereignty.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  Oh, but that's okay because the world came together against bin Laden today,
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  the terrorist, the evil Arab.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  And the caricatures just look just like Nazi cartoons
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  with the Arabs with the big noses and the evil lips like this.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  I find that very offensive.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  I find it offensive when Hitler had the Jews looking like that.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  But it's okay and the Israeli newspapers make Arabs look like that.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  If you're going to be against racism, if you're going to be against tribalism,
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  if you're going to be against all this, you've got to be against it
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  whether it's a black racist, a white racist, a German racist, a Japanese racist.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  And you've got to know the facts, Jack.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  The corrupt United States government that's no longer our government,
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  that's a new world order national security dictatorship government,
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  a crisis government.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  Oh, what have we here? We're flying towards the World Trade Center.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  Let's continue.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  Oh, look what we're flying towards right now.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  This is what it must have felt like for the people in the pilot seat.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  I wonder why TV had this on a few months ago to condition us to accept the hire later
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  without too much panic, scientifically crafted.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  It's not just this, it's everything, sophisticated mind control.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  Now, ma'am, you can finish up.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  Fader up, please.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  Why am I ranting? I'm upset. Go ahead.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  You know, we're not going to be able to take calls if that box keeps cutting out.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  Go ahead. See if it works now.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  I don't know. Go ahead and wiggle the wire in the back, please.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  I'm sorry to the callers. It's Access TV. We're having some difficulties here.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  Here's the lone gunman, their second episode, pilot.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  All right. Just turn it down a little bit now, please, sir.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  It's the third knob, closest knob to you.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  Let me try this call. Go ahead, ma'am.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Do we have her now?
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  All right. Why don't you get Bob Wilson in here
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  and get him to work on it.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  I'm sorry. This box has been broken for years. They haven't replaced it.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  And I'm not mad at the staff here. They don't make the decisions. It's all the city.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  But we need, oh, they almost missed it. Rewind that.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  In this piece, a secret government agency was going to blow up the World Trade Center for martial law.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  This was on just three or four months ago.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  And I predicted a bombing of the World Trade Center because when they do something like this,
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  oh, this must be what it felt like. Oh, here we come. Oh, whoa.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  Mike, why don't you rewind that? Why don't we air ten minutes of this?
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  Yeah, what sound? Go ahead and rewind it.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Now I'm going to get this box fixed. I have to do it myself.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to try to calmly come back and take your calls at the phone box works and recap the news.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  This is why I can't get calm. I've been telling you this was going to happen for years.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  I've been telling you they're going to come out and say give up your liberties.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  And this is only the beginning. More is going to happen.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  Now they're going to want your guns. They're going to want your property.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  The police are going to treat you like dirt at checkpoints.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  The mayor was on saying we need to give up our liberties yesterday.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  Condoleezza Rice, National Security Advisor of the sheriff locally saying they may pull us over and search us without warrants.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  This is the control. Remember the fake nuclear spill last year in Austin?
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  Remember all that? Remember the fake biological attacks downtown?
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  And I jumped in front of ABC News live and screamed it's fake. It's fake.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  And they had to admit it was fake, creating the illusion, getting you ready for this to happen.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  As they build all these FEMA camps, as we go from 1.3 million in prison two years ago to 6.5 million today in prison.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  As the police state unfolds, as the face scanning cameras go in.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000]  I told you all this would happen.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  Alright, here's Fox. We actually have the script on Infowars.com.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  Here they are conditioning you to accept the horror of four months ago just like they've done on everything else.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  And I predicted this when this show came out because they've already bombed the World Trade Center once.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  It's the apple of the Federal Reserve, IMF, World Bank power access terrorism eye.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  And they've knocked out our financial center while the EU is rolling out.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  Are you ready with that tape, Mike?
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  I want to rewind it about ten minutes.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  This is from the loan gunman. I'll take a break. I'll come back and recap.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  Then we'll go to this lady that disagrees or whatever.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  Continue with your calls. I believe this is a government bombing.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  I've been warning you. Even the statesman writer agreed with me on the phone.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  Printed my quotes but not all of them.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  The government was planning it. We have the smoking gun documents.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  Baltimore Sun, New York Times.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  They bombed Oklahoma City. They bombed it all.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  And I'm telling you, your property, your family, everything.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  A month ago, they were in the news, Fox and ABC and AP.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  And I read it on air. You'll see the reruns airing.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  Remember, this is, I'm live right now, the 12th of September, 2001.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000]  This happened on 9-11, 9-1-1, 9-11.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  Now you'll see shows from me going back several months, several years.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  And I'll be predicting all of this. My shows re-air over and over again.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  I had one air today where I predicted all of this.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  You put it in your filthy pipe and you smoke it.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000]  There's a camp ready for your kids.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000]  If there's enough of these terrorist attacks, cops will stomp your children's brains out
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  and ask for seconds.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  They're using militant enthusiasm, tribalism to get us to circle the wagons.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  Bin Laden, Saddam, they all belong to this government.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000]  They've been kept in power because they're doing their filthy jobs.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000]  Infowars.com for all the documents.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  We'll come back and we'll take your calls.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  But here is Fox News, Fox TV, throwing it in your face.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  This is what it must have looked like yesterday morning as those two planes came in.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  Stay with us.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  Your name, Eva Del Harlow, is an anagram of Lee Harvey Oswald.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  Some joke.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  I know who you really are, sugar.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  And I can tell the world in my silly little rag.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000]  Alright, try cutting electrical power.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  I've thought of that. I've thought of everything.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  We're experiencing some technical difficulties up here.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  At this time, we'd like you all to return to your seats.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000]  And kiss your asses goodbye.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  Finally, we're getting close.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  I know, I know.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000]  Damn it!
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000]  New York Center, this is Atlantic National Flight 265 heavy.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000]  We are declaring an emergency.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.000]  We have 110 souls on board, 16,000 pounds of fuel, and no dangerous goods or cargo to report.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000]  Come on, Pro Hickey.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000]  Fronts have failed, haven't they?
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  There's still hope.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  I hope my next turn out is as nice as my last.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  Hey, I need you now.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  We've got manual overriding.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  We've got manual overriding.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  We've got manual overriding.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  If we can't get to the FBI, we'll go public.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  With your testimony, we can break this conspiracy wide open.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  Bring Overlord down.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  The whole operation.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Dad.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  What is it?
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  God, I see myself in you.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  Okay, folks, just wait just about one minute.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  We'll try to get Alex back in here.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  Kind of caught us off guard here.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  That's all the film. Hold on one second.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  All right, try cutting electrical power.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  I've thought of that.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  I've thought of everything.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  We're experiencing some, uh,
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  some technical difficulties over here.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  We've got an emergency.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  We've got an emergency.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  We've got an emergency.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  We've got an emergency.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  We've got an emergency.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  We've got an emergency.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  We're experiencing some, uh,
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  some technical difficulties up here.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  At this time, we'd like you all to return your seats.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  And kiss your asses goodbye.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  Finally, we're getting close.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  I know, I know.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Damn it!
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  New York Center, this is Atlantic National Flight 265 heavy.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  We are declaring an emergency.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  We have 110 souls on board,
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  1,000 pounds of fuel,
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  and no dangerous goods or cargo to report.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  Come on, Pro Hickey.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  Fronts have failed, haven't they?
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  There's still hope.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  Hope my next turn out as nice as my last one.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  Hey, I need you now.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  We've got manual override.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  We can't get to the FBI.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  We'll go public.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  With your testimony...
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  No, the FBI, they will save us.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  There's a bad government group
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  that blows stuff up
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  to give you martial law,
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  but the good government saves you.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  I have predicted all of this.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  We have run out of fuel.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  We have run out of fuel.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  We have run out of fuel.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  We have run out of fuel.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  We have run out of fuel.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  I have predicted all of this.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  We have read the documents on the air.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  The government was planning all of this.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  Baltimore Sun, New York Times,
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  from April,
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  MSNBC,
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  from August 24th, 1998,
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  on Infowars.com.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  Bin Laden
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  is a known CIA
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  asset. He is a creation.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  And now they're telling us
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  to give up our rights
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  in exchange for security.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  There's no such thing.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  The borders are wide open.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  We are surrounded by nuclear missiles.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  Chinese and Russian subs are surrounding us.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  Our military has been cut to nothing.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  What's left is being used
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  for internal security forces.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  Bush is cutting nuclear missiles unilaterally.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  Out Clinton in Clinton.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  The Chinese military has moved missiles
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  back into Cuba. They've taken over
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  the Panama Canal. They've given nuclear missiles
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  and designs that we gave them
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  and the delivery systems to Iran.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Iran is working with the Great Satan.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  The New World Order.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  It's not the people of Iran.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  It's not the people of America.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  It's not the people of Iraq.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  It's the sick, oh, New World Order leaders.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  Now let's go to the callers.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  Hello, caller on the air.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  Let's see. Did you say
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  you have actual footage
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  of Chuck Schuman gloating
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  after the fall of the Trade Center?
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  Yes. Mike, bring me the tapes
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  Can you imagine? I was on the air
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  ten hours yesterday. I normally do
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  six hours a day of live radio.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  I taped
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  I don't know, six tapes
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  two hours. I taped 12 hours
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  high quality speed yesterday.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  This is only a small
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  portion and I don't even know which tape
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  it's on. These are only three of them.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  We have just tape after tape after
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  tape. Here, take them back, Mike.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  But I have Schumer. It'll be in a film I make.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  Don't worry.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  We've got like
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  four or five tapes, I don't know,
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  more than 12 hours in there. And I have
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  Schumer, as everybody else is crying and after
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  their singing, going
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  with Dashiell, just laughing and giggling.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  We just had him on the air.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  Go ahead and
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  finish, sir.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  You know,
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  these phones are out of control. Come turn this up for me
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  very delicately, please.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  Just turn it up
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  a little bit. Don't touch it or it'll short
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  out.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  Alright.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  You're on the air, sir. Go ahead.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  Yes, they can hear you. I can't really. Go ahead.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  Now I can. Go ahead.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  Yeah, so you're going to have not just
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  a picture of him, but the actual
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  audio with the picture, of course.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  I don't get the point
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  of your slithering comments.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  Yeah, it's
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  I know
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  what you're saying. It's just like
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  you know, my mom is so like
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  well, gotta have proof, not
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  just any pictures, but actual audio
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  with it, you know, and I'm trying. Well, I'm not trying
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  to be mean to you, sir, but have you
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  not seen my show as I predicted all of this?
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  I've been recording all your shows and
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  I'm driving my mom crazy. Alright,
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  you're a nice guy. Shouldn't have been mean to you. I don't mind people
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  disagree with me. My point is, sir,
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  yes, I have Chuckie Schumer laughing and
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  making jokes on tape. Good.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  Good.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  I can't wait to see that.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  The same guy that says arm Israel,
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  but disarm the American people.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  Okay, do you want to talk
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  to that nice lady you
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  put on hold a while back?
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  She was on your line. She hung up. I couldn't take
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  her call because the phone system was screwed up.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  Yeah, well, can you
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  explain to her nicely that
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  you weren't being mean?
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  No, I'm calling Nazi Germany
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  bad. I'm calling what Israel's doing
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  bad. No, I'm talking about her
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  thinking that you just hung up on her
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  like C-SPAN does to people who try
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  to make a point and the guy just
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  on C-SPAN would just hang
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  up on the person when they began to say
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  and Dick Cheney wouldn't
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  admit and Dick Cheney and the guy just
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  clicks this woman
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  off on C-SPAN and I think
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  C-SPAN is kind of biased on the Washington
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  Journal. Well, at least you can call
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  in. I've called in and gotten a few words
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  out, but yeah, it's pretty bad.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  Yeah, and I
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  did you hear me read the documents about how the
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  feds wanted to blow up airliners for a pretext
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  for war?
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  Yeah, I've read it on the web
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  and it is
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  so shocking. It's almost
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  it's about unbelievable. It's so
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  shocking. But you understand now they
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  came out and said what I said. They say
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  give up your rights. Now's the time to give
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  up your rights.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  Yeah, I want to tell you about the
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  the website about
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  the document about the
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  camps. When I click on it,
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  it says page not found and that
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  happens to a lot of the links and
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  not only that, but with the links you have
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  when I click on it, it's
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  new information. It doesn't
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  refer to. Yeah, that's a problem.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  We put up a hundred new links every day on the
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  website and
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  newspapers and the AP and their news
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  wires change the links.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  But I have shown
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  the document on the air. I have read it. We have
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  put the link up repeatedly and I go to it
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  routinely. Yeah, and just
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  luck. I found the link that that
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  was the urban warrior
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  and it was scary. It says
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  we're watching every keystroke you make.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  Do not even attempt to mirror
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  the site because we were watching
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  you.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  Now that is scary. And
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  so, yeah. Well, sir, have you seen the footage
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  of where they hired provocateurs in Seattle?
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  Oh, yeah, I taped it. I taped
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  it and then put 500 peaceful people
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  in a FEMA camp. Yeah.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  All right. I appreciate your call.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  Hello, caller on the air. Yeah,
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  just a comment about that movie we're showing.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  You know, I wonder if I
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  made a movie that I was going to kill someone
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  a home movie and
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  then that person
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  turned up dead and that
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  tape was shown to a jury
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  how that would look, how that would implicate me
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  and it's kind of interesting that
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  they would make this movie.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  Let me make one other observation
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  about the media and then I want you to comment on that
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  because I want to
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  say that how many times
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  out there have you all
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  looked on the TV,
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  saw, let's just, for example,
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  use a Middle Eastern crowd
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  chanting and
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  celebrating some heinous act and you've said
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  to yourself, gee,
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  those people are so brainwashed by
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  state controlled propaganda machine
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  and I want to put this out there
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  that if people are not considering
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  what you're saying about the fact that our government
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  has handed out these biological weapons,
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  if people do not do things
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  other than read the mainstream
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  media, listen to
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  Katie Couric and Tom Brokaw, if they aren't
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  questioning then they are no better
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  than those people that they are
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  sitting there and looking at
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  saying, gee, they're so brainwashed
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  that they should think about that
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  that they're no better than those people
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  if all they're doing is watching
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  their media like a little lap dog
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000]  and not asking questions.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  I hear you and I appreciate the call.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  All I can say
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  is you sit there,
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  you know, I'm not for the Palestinians, I'm not for the
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  Israelis, I'm not for anybody, that is their leaders.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  I'm for the people of
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  this world and I'm here to tell
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  you after this attack they're
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  saying the governments, it's a global
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  war against terrorism and that means
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  a war against your civil liberties.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  You're all guilty until proven innocent.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  And as I predicted when this happened,
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  before it happened, I said when it
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  happens they're going to say give up your rights.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  Meanwhile they're doing everything they can
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  creating bin Laden, creating
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  Saddam, opening up our borders,
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  arming China with the newest systems
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  to allow this
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  to happen. Let's take another call.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  Hello caller on the air. Hey Alex, Mike Moore.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  Hey Mike, what's going on?
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  Yeah, I'm glad my neighbor got that
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  tape to you and stuff and we were able to get that on the air.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  I was at a defense
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  link last night
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  and got a copy of the news transcript from the
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  Pentagon briefing
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  and something I found very interesting in it.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  One of the questions was
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  Mr. Secretary, we were getting reports from CNN
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  and others that
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  bombs are exploding in Kabul, Afghanistan.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  Are we at the moment striking
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  back and if so, is the target
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  Osama bin Laden and his organization?
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  And the guy
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  by the name of Runesfield answered.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  He said no, I believe that's
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  internal fighting but we may need
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  to hit him again. No, what he says here
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  is I've seen those reports
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  today and then he pauses
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  and he says in no way is the United States government
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  connected to these explosions.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  I actually saw the video
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  of it too. I know.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  You can obviously tell that he was going to say
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  something and then he says
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  we may need to hit him again.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  Yeah, I know.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  It's not time for discussions like that.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  Obviously there is something else
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  going on. This is from the transcript
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  right off the defense link
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  website.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  Have you seen the document we put on screen
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  about the 12 Army concentration
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  camps that already have people on them?
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  Yes, I have those
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  printed out on my desk.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000]  Well, I mean, they're on my website
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  and then people say oh no, they're not.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  They're right there right now.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  Yes, they are. All of this that I just listed
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  is there. Bin Laden,
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  CIS, MSNBC,
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  the Feds plan to blow up airlines and bomb Washington
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  as a pretext for martial law.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  That's Baltimore Sun.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  I mean, it's all right here.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  I'm not making this up.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  I wanted to get on the air today
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  and say that I have every one of the documents
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  that you have. I've got most of them from your website
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  and others from search engines.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  Those documents do exist. They are
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  real.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  Don't forget to mention the Department of the Army
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  from February 22nd
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  where they were handing
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  that information out to Mike Hanson
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  at Waco when they
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  staged that deal with the bus.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  Remember where they were pulling the people off of the buses
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  and searching them with no
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  pretext whatsoever? And they said that
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  in the document on Infowars.com
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  we've shown them many times on the screen,
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  they say that we are here to serve
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  search warrants, to attack homes,
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  call us anytime. Absolutely.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  But oh, the military's out to keep
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  us safe. I'm not anti-military.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  That's not our military's job.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  Our forefathers fought
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  to stop this from happening in the United States.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  And now they're telling us give up all our freedoms.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  Well, Alex, I want to go on record as saying
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  that I took an oath back in 1987
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  for the United States Navy to
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  uphold and defend the Constitution
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  of the United States of America
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  People need to quit looking for a
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  boogie man and start looking toward the
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  domestic front because that's where this is coming from.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  Absolutely, sir. Thank you
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  for sending us the lone gunman footage.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  Very useful.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  Hello caller, you're on the air.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  Hi. I wanted to tell you that
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  two days before this attack
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  President
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000]  Bush gives a radio speech
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  and he had
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  some governor come on right after him
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  the governor of Arizona
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  and they said that they were lifting the borders
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  they were lifting the numbers of the
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  people that could come in through both Canada
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  and Mexico. And that was
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  two days before these attacks.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  So even if those people weren't
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  in the country before then, they
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  sure had an easy way of getting
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  They last week announced
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  they're getting rid of the borders, rid of our
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  national sovereignty under the guise of
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  immigration and trade
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  and they are the ones that caused this
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  whether the government did it themselves
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  or allowed it to take place. I mean look
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  it's not my opinion
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  World Trade Center
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  93. How many shows have I read
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  the New York Times story from October 28
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  93 where they admit the FBI
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  was recorded secretly admitting
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  they cooked the bomb, trained the drivers
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  and allowed the bombing to go forward
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  Thank God cars were parked up against
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  those pylons so they couldn't get
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  their truck right up against it or one of
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  those would have been brought down.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  Amazing and then I thought
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  something else was really really strange
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  they would not
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  Pat Forgione, superintendent of AISD
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  would not allow teachers to
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  play this in their classrooms
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  They would not allow
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  students to sit in their classrooms and
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  watch this happen
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  They would not allow teachers to play this
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  history on TV and I thought well that's
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  really strange because when I was young
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  President Kennedy was killed
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  everybody went home
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  It's all part of
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  not letting kids run and play at recess
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  not letting them play dodgeball
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  training them to be little weak jellyfish
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  Yes, yes they wanted them
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  to carry on with their normal
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  activities and then you look on
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  channel 8 and there's sociologists
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  telling you what to tell your kids
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  about this. It's just amazing
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  We're all children in their system
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  ma'am how long have you been watching the show?
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  Your show? Yes
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  About a year now? How long have I been
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  predicting and reading the documents of the government
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  controlling the terrorists? As long as I've
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  been watching your show
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  and that was my first
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  that you were the first person
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  I lived in San Marcos
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  15 years before I moved here and
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  you were the first person that ever
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  ever caught my attention and
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  ever said anything about this
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  in my entire life and
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  I do thank you. I thank you very much
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  for having me overcome
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  your sometimes
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  overbearing presentation. I mean
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  that alone was enough to make me go
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  oh well no, no, no, no. But it was
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  what you said. Now I look beyond
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  I know why you get angry
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  I know why you have the tears and I
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  know why you fight so hard. It's because
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  it's the absolute God's
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  truth. Well the
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  I'm sitting here
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  and I have a hundred things I want to say
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  and they all prove what I have to say and I
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  just, I can calm down
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  on radio. I just can't get calm on
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  this TV show.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  I'm in this room with these hot lights on me and there's
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  a TV set over there with myself on it and these cameras
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  pointed at me and I'm in here alone and
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  I don't know how to interact here. I don't know how to go through the points
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  but I'll tell you what I'm going to do right now. I'm going
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  to be calm. I'm going to do a 10 minute presentation
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  a recap of what's happened. Okay?
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  Yeah. Thank you very much though
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  I look beyond that and I understand
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  your emotion now. I understand
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  you and I know and I
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  I'm actually behaving the same way
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  and almost getting fired from my job
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  because as a teacher I'm telling my
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  students the truth and they're trying to get me
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  to shut my mouth in my classroom and I
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  won't do it. So I expect
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  not to have a job soon but I'm telling
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  my students the other side.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  If that happens sue them. We'll help you
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  call us and we'll come interview
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  you. Thank you. Thank you.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  Yeah. People at work will talk about
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  how gun control doesn't
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  work and has made England's crime rate double and
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  triple and they get fired.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  Just talking about the Second
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  Amendment. Talking about stuff on the news.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  My God a slave talked about
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  guns. Oh I like the police in black
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  uniforms and ski masks but one of the
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  slaves like me just mentioned a gun.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  We're being domesticated.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  We're being trained. We're being made
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  little weak nothings. Alright let me calmly
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  go through it then we'll go back to your calls.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  All throughout
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  history.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  All throughout history.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  They have
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  used
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  acts of terrorism to create
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  the illusion
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  of fear and to create
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  the system for control. You create the
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  crisis. You demonstrate fear. The pundits
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  say something must be done. What are they
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  going to do about it? And then the government
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  announces some draconian change
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  to stop the new enemy and everybody gets
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  around it and supports it and a major
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  change can develop.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  Let me give you historical examples.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  Almost two thousand years
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  ago a very
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  corrupt Roman emperor
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  named Nero
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  had been murdering all the Christians
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  and so does his predecessor.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  Christians were becoming very popular because they would
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  sit there and
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  they had such a faith they would let the lions
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  tear them apart peaceably. They would be burned at the stake
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  crucified upside down. Have their heads
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  cut off. Many Roman leaders
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  people on the senate were becoming Christian.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  The
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  non-violent stance against the tyranny of
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  Rome was catching on. So
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  Nero later wrote about it. He got so decadent he bragged
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  that he had
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  Rome in the poor district
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  set alight and blamed it on the Christians.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  They found the stone tablets where they
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  put them up saying already made
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  the Christians set the fires.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  Later he bragged ha ha
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  that he fiddled and enjoyed himself
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  you know Nero fiddled
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  and drank a goblet of wine
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  and got to expand his palace
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  into their zone.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  He didn't like looking down on the slum and smelling
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  all the feces of the population.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  This is the historical Roman documents.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  But it worked. Suddenly the people were
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  screaming with rage kill the
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  Christians. And on my website
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  I have a whole essay documenting
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  this throughout history.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  But let's fast forward
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  to Adolf Hitler.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  Let's go to the Spanish
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  American war turn of the century Teddy
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  Roosevelt was rough riders.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  Right before he got
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  elected. They wanted
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  Spain. They wanted Cuba. They
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  wanted to get Spain out of there. They wanted Spain out of
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  the western hemisphere and their empire.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  They wanted
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  the islands for
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  shipping stations in the Pacific, the Philippines.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  And so they blew up the
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  main right there in Havana
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  Harbor as the feds
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  proposed in 62 to do again
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  here in the Baltimore sun along with
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  blowing up the capital as a pretext
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  to invade Cuba.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  And what I want to explain to you here is this.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  Then in
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  1941
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  three days
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  before and they have this in the Library of Congress.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  It's now on Discovery Channel. I've interviewed the authors
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  and the lecturers and have copies of the documents
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  that we're going to re-air those radio
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  shows here on access.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  They actually this is so key
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  had
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  communicated with Admiral Yamamoto three days
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  away saying we will steam towards
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  you will attack in the morning of December 7th.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  We will annihilate the Pacific fleet and
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  death blow to America. That's the copy from
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  Yamamoto two weeks before
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  an uncoated message was sent to all
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  diplomatic facilities
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  that didn't have the special purple code
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  coding machines in the Japanese
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  Empire. That was intercepted. All
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000]  those intercepts were taken to the office of the president
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  then serving his third term
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  after saving us from the depression
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  they created. Another example of
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  problem reaction solution
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  to bring us command
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  and control and socialism.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  It's on the History
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  Channel now. It's
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  everywhere. They had the purple
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  code broken in 1938.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  The British knew about it.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  That's common
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  knowledge. Now they allowed that to happen
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  and this is now on the History Channel.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  You're saying they wouldn't allow this to happen. They're calling
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  it the new Pearl Harbor. Notice all these movies
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  came out. Pearl Harbor, Band of
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  Brothers, all these other war films.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  All this
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  army recruiting with the army in the new black
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  uniform, the new black beret, Army of
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  2001.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  This is part of getting the New World Order going.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  Now they're saying the terrorists have attacked us.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  Let's give you another example. 1933.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  Hitler's elected chancellor
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  von Hindenburg dies.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  Hitler wants to abolish
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  the presidency and control the whole parliament.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  He blows up the Reichstag,
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  grabs a poor retarded
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  Jewish homeless man, blames it on him.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  They hang him. He declares
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  martial law,
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  confiscates the guns, builds the
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  prisons. The prison population goes from
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  100,000 up to about 6 million
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  in 3 or 4 years.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  Funny, we now have 6.5 million in prison.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  It was 1.3 million 2 years ago.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  Government's own numbers
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  out last week. We read it on air last week.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  So
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  people say why would the government do
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  something like this? Come on, that's a stupid question.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  It's not our government.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  In 1947 we have the National Security
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  Act where everything went secret.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  Everything went underground. Underground bases.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  Secret technologies.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  CIA developing
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  mind control drugs. MK Ultra
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  Senate hearings. All documented.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  And then
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  1962. One more shot please.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  And again,
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  I'm not even scratching the surface. I have an essay
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  written by a scholar.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  Scholarly gentleman on my
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  website that goes through dozens of examples
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  in modern history.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  Called the Politics of Terror.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  Baltimore Sun
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  NSA sheds light on secret
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  US terror plan called Cuban Invasion
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  pretext. Casualty list, meaning
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000]  numbers of dead people in US
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  newspapers would cause a helpful wave
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000]  of indignation. That means anger and
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  resolve. December 7,
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000]  1941.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  A day
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  that will live in infamy.
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  Let me get my phony blue blood takeover
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000]  voice down for you.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  The plan is laid out in
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  documents signed by the five Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  And confirmed.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  Kennedy said no to the plan
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  and was assassinated six months later.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000]  It was
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  signed on to by everybody
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  though. They wanted to blow up airliners.
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  Blow up John McCain's spacecraft
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  as he took off in 1962. Blame
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  it on Cuba.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  They would publicize fabricated evidence
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  that Cuba had used electronic interference
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  to sabotage the flight. The documents
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  from the NSA show.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  Somebody at the NSA leaked this
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  to the news. Bless
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  you. Praise you.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  Now we hear Bush and the liberals
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  as well together trying to pass
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  a bill last week making
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  it a crime
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000]  punishable by death
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000]  for someone in the government to leak information
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000]  to the news and to get rid of the
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000]  journalist source
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  privilege. So next time somebody
[01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000]  in the NSA leaks these documents
[01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000]  leaves them at
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000]  the Library of Congress leaks them
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000]  tells Bamford to go down there
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000]  2020 executive to find them.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000]  They're just going to get killed.
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000]  They're about to pass
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  a law to be able to assassinate whoever they want.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000]  007 powers
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000]  were really already in effect. Now
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  they're publicizing it.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  So they were going to attack
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  the Marines at Guantanamo Bay.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  The US Army dressed up
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  as
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  Cuban nationals.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  Now that was the takeout
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  Fidel. Kennedy said no.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  He announced he was going to abolish
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  the CIA get us out of Vietnam
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  started printing Lincoln greenbacks
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  say US note on it. Go to a coin shop
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  they'll have a five dollar bill says US note.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  Jack Kennedy
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  there's no Federal Reserve on it. He was
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  kicking the dictatorship out. He said look
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  I'm a blue blood but I care about
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  the people. I
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  am not about Mike
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  Mike let's get those other tapes in there brother.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  He said I am not about
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  to allow
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  you to do this to our country.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  And that's why they killed him.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  But I know the lone bullet
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  it changed all those directions. It didn't
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  even get bent up and
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  I know it was one person did it.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  I know I'm a conspiracy theorist. I understand
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  here's
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  another one. I keep going back over the basics
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000]  Ben Laden comes home to
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  roost as CIA ties are only the beginning
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  of the woeful story.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  August 24th 98 at the CIA
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  it happens often enough to have a code name
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  blow back simply defined as the term
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  that describes an agent an operative
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  or an operation that has turned on its creators
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000]  on some of Ben Laden our new public enemy
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  number one is the personification of blow
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  back and the fact that he is viewed as a
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  hero by millions in the Islamic world proves
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  again the old adage you reap what you
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  sow.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  Then it goes into Ben Laden's beginnings
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000]  as anyone who's bothered to read as far
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  certainly knows Ben Laden is the heir
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  to the largest Saudi family
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  construction fortune who at least since the
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  early 90s uses money to finance countless
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  attacks on the US interest.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  But you see before that he was the top
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  man for the CIA.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  Saddam is
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  the top man before that public
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  record
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  and they're doing their job
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  now and they will use these pretexts
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  to bring you martial law. They're not
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  going to shut down the border. They're
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000]  going to open it up in a few weeks again completely
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  wide open to get rid of our sovereignty they're bragging
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  in the front page of Time of Mexico
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  red white and green no more national
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  sovereignty for Mexico or the US
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  or Canada world government just like
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  the EU
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  the National Association
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  of the Bar Association out
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  of Chicago's lobbying to get rid of jury rights
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  and attorney client privilege
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  Fox News Houston
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  Chronicle. We've read it
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  here on the air. It's at info
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  wars dot com. Let's get a big info
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  wars up for him gentlemen.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  So we
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  have all of this
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  developing
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  and they're on the news Henry Kissinger
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  saying we have to get rid of this old fashioned
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  moral argument that we
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  shouldn't give up our liberties for
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  security. We should give up our liberties
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  we should give up our liberties
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  Frank Keating
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  one of the architects of the Oklahoma City bombing
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  the governor former FBI
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  chieftain announces we need to quote
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  give up liberty for security. We have this all
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  on tape. We're just sticking tapes
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  in the machine. We haven't even time to watch him.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  We taped yesterday just going to
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  play that play this
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  I've got
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  at least 12 hours. Mike's got about four hours
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  we'll try to have
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  some excerpts pulled out for you next week to show
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  you what we're talking about here.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  So who stands
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  to gain from this bombing
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  certainly not these Muslim
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  third world countries
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  it's the security
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  system it's the security apparatus
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  the military industrial complex
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  Lockheed Martin put in the face
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  scanning cameras and the kids
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  in 100 school districts thumb scanning
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  to get their food and
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  the armored vehicles that have been delivered to
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  police departments and the
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  all of this
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  you better get on the ball and speak out against
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  it and say I'm not giving up my rights buddy
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  if I will have
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  some terrorism
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  think about that
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  I want you to think about that
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  let me
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  put me back in the middle guys
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  oh
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  people think I might go whoop whoop
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  sliding it back and forth now
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  this is a serious show guys you know that you're doing a good job
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  um
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  I like the effects
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  but it's like third world television when I'm you know flipping
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  back and forth and coming in
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  look at that ladies and
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  gentlemen look at it drop from demolitions in the
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000]  bottom
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  look at that
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  show
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  the bottom line is your police
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  are militarized they're geared up they've been saying
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  this has been happening they're working with the military
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000]  everybody's circling the
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  wagons we gotta do something
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  they're just gonna sit back probably for
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  the next week or so and we gotta
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  do something we gotta do something we're gonna have to give up our rights
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  are you gonna bomb somebody
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  well we might bomb some Arabs who are out
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  you know hurting goats but
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000]  no Ben Laden works for us and
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  we kept Saddam in now for 11 years
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  so we can have the U.N. encircle
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  the country and he keeps them down internally
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000]  for us and murders the Kurds
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  with nerve gas we gave him in the
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  80s and uh then he gives all
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000]  the all of the U.N. and he's a good servant
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  that's what's happened
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000]  he was our big buddy in the 80s
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000]  million dead
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000]  Iraqis since the war starving to death no medicine
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000]  no power no nothing
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000]  and you
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  are complicit in supporting that
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000]  this new world order doesn't see
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000]  race it doesn't see region it controls
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  leaders to bring order out of
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000]  chaos
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  I hope you
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000]  figure that out by now
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  so these are
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000]  the news stories that we have covered today
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000]  a few of the other points
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  we have conclusively proven that Oklahoma
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  City was a
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  government bombing
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  I have interviewed the former head of the FBI
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000]  crime lab on the air who says it was
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000]  who quit over it general Benton Parton the former
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  head of air force weapons development general
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  Parton the top grand
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000]  juror Hoppy Heidelberg in the first Oklahoma
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  grand jury was threatened by
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000]  FBI at his home to stop asking questions
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  about the multiple bombs that were removed
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000]  caught on video tape by
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  local news that we've aired here
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000]  why did the feds confiscate 12 surveillance
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  cameras and then claim national security
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  when people try to get it into the court case
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  you got McVeigh pulling up to bomb that
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000]  building why not show the video
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  so we have
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000]  the evidence of that we have the World Trade Center
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  October 28th
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000]  1993 New York Times
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000]  a month or so after the bombing
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  happened in January
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000]  and then months later it came
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  out
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  that
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  they had hired provocateurs to go
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000]  in and cook the bomb train the drivers
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000]  so the New York Times three days
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  before the CIA folks they
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000]  hired said look the bombs built
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  the people are trained
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  let's
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  move in for the sting and the FBI chief of
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  New York said on tape because the guy didn't want to get
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  in trouble he recorded the FBI chief
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  saying no the bombing goes forward
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  the
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  security guard the World Trade Center tried to stop
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  the truck with two illiterate
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000]  ignorant Palestinian
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  young man who had been brought over here
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000]  because they didn't even have high school educations
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  and they were looking so suspicious
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000]  and the head security said no
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  let them park their truck
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000]  this is the New York Times
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  October 28th 1993
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  I know newspaper writers are watching
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000]  go read it for yourself with your
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000]  Lexus Nexus search system
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  it has been cut out of the micro film
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  in a lot of libraries since I've been reporting on it
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  nationwide on 100 radio stations but I
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  have copies of it we've shown it here in documentaries
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  so there's the devastation in lower Manhattan
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000]  that's what's unfolding
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  that's what's developing
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  now do you understand
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  they tried to bomb it and take one of the towers
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  out but the car couldn't park up against the pillar
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  because other cars were parked there in 93
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000]  the feds used provocateurs
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  now what happens 8 years later
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  now I'm asking you who was the prime suspect
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  same thing
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  same thing with Oklahoma City
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  same thing with Waco we know special forces were sent in
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  we have the documents we have the memos
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  we have state police officer David Key that came forward
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  we have Gene Cullen
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  former CIA chief over
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  global operations reporting that Delta Force
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  was sent in to kill the Davidians
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  we don't make this stuff
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  up folks
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  and now they're going to radically re-engineer
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  our society forever
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  unless we stand up and say
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  no you're not going to take our rights
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  shut down the border
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  get the Chinese military out of Panama Canal
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  which they now run
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  stop giving China the newest missile
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000]  designs that they're giving openly to
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  Iran see how you have that transfer
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  they're doing all this stuff to destabilize
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  the world giving chemical and biological
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  weapons from the Tanox company in Houston
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  with James Baker heading it up
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  to Saddam during the 80's
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  funding the Mujahideen headed
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  up by Rich bin Laden who builds all
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  our bases in Saudi Arabia
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  while he's the enemy
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  his company builds our bases
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  that is a fact folks
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  but they count on you to be stupid
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  they count on most of you to tune into the mainstream media
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  with the same pap over and over again
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  this is
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  so big I could be pulling my hair out
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  this is so big this is a crisis
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  let's take calls
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  hello caller you're on the air
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  yes
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  I was wondering
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  I've just tuned into your show for the first time
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  I consider myself an
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  educated intelligent man
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  and you're really
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  starting to change my opinions
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  and it's quite scary what you're saying
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  and I just want to know
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  how do we react
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  what do we do to prevent
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  things from going to the police state
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  I have links on my website
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  the army brags they got 12 camps
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  with people in them right now
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  so
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  army.mil man
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  links right to it they're bragging
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  but what do we do
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  as quote unquote
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  free citizens you call every talk show
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  you call the governor you call the president
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  and you say I know you
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  are behind this are you allowed this to happen
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  a couple months ago
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  you'll see the tape from a couple months ago with the
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  date like on the screen right now
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  re-airing where I

[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  great job and I
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  went to the articles and I put up the White House
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  and congressional phone numbers and
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  I should call them and beg them please
