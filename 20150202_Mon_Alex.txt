[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:26.080]  Texas Alex Jones you know I'm gonna do a special report on it really all that
[00:26.080 --> 00:32.800]  means is I'll actually dig up all the documentation put it on screen but I
[00:32.800 --> 00:35.160]  think I'm gonna put together a special report this week or next week in fact
[00:35.160 --> 00:41.200]  I'm going to do it where we show the CIA founding Miss magazine the Pentagon
[00:41.200 --> 00:45.760]  declassifying by the 60s that they had funded through the Department of War the
[00:45.760 --> 00:50.840]  suffrage movement so that they could basically make women awards of the
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.840]  state the entire empower women movement has turned them into pure sexual tart
[00:56.840 --> 01:03.000]  objects married to the state illegitimacy has gone from around 10% over
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.440]  50% the prison population has exploded about 800% depending on which numbers
[01:09.440 --> 01:15.680]  you look at we are a cursed nation doesn't mean that I want to dial back
[01:15.680 --> 01:19.760]  women's suffrage it's just that they will create a liberation movement not to
[01:19.760 --> 01:26.720]  liberate but to create a new form of slavery just like they got rid of one
[01:26.720 --> 01:31.240]  form of tyranny getting rid of segregation and Jim Crow laws and
[01:31.240 --> 01:36.880]  brought in another one even more evil because it really can't be seen as
[01:36.880 --> 01:42.160]  easily and then people's identity is in being slaves of the state and being
[01:42.160 --> 01:45.880]  racially based the exact opposite of what Martin Luther King tried to get
[01:45.880 --> 01:53.720]  people out of and I say that because I did tape the Super Bowl and I got off
[01:53.720 --> 01:58.120]  the radio drove home had friends and family over we had it on the background
[01:58.120 --> 02:02.920]  watch the end of it very good game according to the standards out there my
[02:02.920 --> 02:06.400]  mom was sitting there watching it going best Super Bowl ever she's the big
[02:06.400 --> 02:10.080]  football fan in the family I mean we all grew up being football fans are up in
[02:10.080 --> 02:13.360]  Dallas for heaven's sakes there's like a religion I think that's why I've kind of
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.480]  rebelled against it and then after it was over I went ahead and watched some
[02:18.480 --> 02:26.320]  swaths of it and it was just pure anti male garbage anti family garbage you
[02:26.320 --> 02:33.680]  can see the theme you've got T mobile ads saying sorry it's a boy when the
[02:33.680 --> 02:39.280]  baby's born you've got Nissan with dad the only good dad because he delivers
[02:39.280 --> 02:44.880]  his girl to join the military to be killed you've got that's an e-sion add
[02:44.880 --> 02:51.160]  it well that's a toy to add on the military front you've got a I'm gonna
[02:51.160 --> 02:56.360]  go over all this today it was simply mind-blowing how there was a unified
[02:56.360 --> 03:06.240]  theme going after fatherhood and implying that men existing suppresses
[03:06.240 --> 03:13.280]  women they had a maxi pad always add for feminine hygiene products where it's
[03:13.280 --> 03:19.280]  always like a girl I mean that's an incredibly rare statement that you
[03:19.280 --> 03:23.760]  fight like a girl you swing a baseball bat like a girl but they take that and
[03:23.760 --> 03:30.640]  rub it in to create animosity between men and women that's all that's going on
[03:30.640 --> 03:35.400]  while the globalist rape us seven ways to Sunday and are bringing in planetary
[03:35.400 --> 03:39.520]  government and bombarding women with estrogen mimicers that give them breast
[03:39.520 --> 03:43.920]  cancer at 3,000% what it was 50 something years ago there's no discussion of
[03:43.920 --> 03:47.880]  empowering women by getting them to learn how to use guns or getting women
[03:47.880 --> 03:53.280]  into jiu-jitsu or boxing no no the feminists don't want any of that they
[03:53.280 --> 03:58.840]  want chicken neck cowardly shaking women with their knees knocking together who
[03:58.840 --> 04:02.760]  were taught in peck men make them do what you say make them even weaker than
[04:02.760 --> 04:09.400]  you and that's how you're strong make boys sit down to go to the bathroom teach
[04:09.400 --> 04:15.560]  boys they're bad they should get Gardasil shots to on and on and on this is
[04:15.560 --> 04:20.880]  mind control this is psychological warfare so we're gonna break all that
[04:20.880 --> 04:24.960]  down today this will be a special report as we go over these clips but I'm gonna
[04:24.960 --> 04:28.640]  go in and get all the CIA documents all the Department of War documents the
[04:28.640 --> 04:32.080]  Edward Bernays documents I'm gonna get all these examples I'm gonna put a big
[04:32.080 --> 04:39.560]  report together showing all this feminism is to make you die alone it is to
[04:39.560 --> 04:43.800]  make you by yourself isolated so corporate and government wolves can tear
[04:43.800 --> 04:48.080]  your guts out politically and then finally physically and then suck you dry

[09:18.680 --> 09:22.400]  spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient

[09:32.920 --> 09:37.760]  supposed to have that discussion they told me to to say that they were sorry

[11:54.960 --> 12:00.840]  mix what's really behind the crisis with Russia the saber rattling the proxy
[12:00.840 --> 12:08.840]  war in Ukraine Marin Katusa has the connections and very powerful interview
[12:08.840 --> 12:13.800]  he did a few months ago with David Knight that a lot of big brains complemented
[12:13.800 --> 12:18.000]  us on so this is an interview you're definitely gonna want to hear coming
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.880]  up in the second hour today with Marin Katusa chief energy strategist for Casey
[12:26.880 --> 12:33.880]  research let me just first off tell you that we're gonna be breaking down the
[12:33.880 --> 12:40.240]  Super Bowl obviously that theme was anti-family anti-father but just bossy
[12:40.240 --> 12:44.080]  all around just like last year the first lady came out and said don't use the
[12:44.080 --> 12:49.320]  word bossy because it means that women are bossy when she's being incredibly
[12:49.320 --> 12:53.840]  bossy and control free she tells you what to eat she tells your kids what to
[12:53.840 --> 13:00.680]  eat she praises different TV shows that she thinks are putting on a good
[13:00.680 --> 13:09.640]  message she's basically our queen our god our goddess our our boss this is the
[13:09.640 --> 13:13.280]  cult government we live in they'd like to turn this country to North Korea where
[13:13.280 --> 13:17.240]  we all thank Kim Jong-un every morning or Hillary Clinton or somebody for the
[13:17.240 --> 13:23.400]  Sun coming up better vote for Hillary or you're against women so we're gonna be
[13:23.400 --> 13:27.400]  breaking that down it's just so insulting to imply that men don't love
[13:27.400 --> 13:32.320]  their daughters just as much or more than their sons my experience more they
[13:32.320 --> 13:39.240]  get spoiled more I have two daughters and they get given basically women in
[13:39.240 --> 13:47.160]  general everything in society and dads are out there with their daughters at
[13:47.160 --> 13:51.480]  softball games and baseball games and soccer games and are a hundred percent
[13:51.480 --> 13:55.920]  back in their daughters but not because they got lectured to do so by five
[13:55.920 --> 14:01.440]  different ads they aired during the Super Bowl that I caught notice it's
[14:01.440 --> 14:06.080]  thematic though there's an agenda just like when Eric Holder got up there
[14:06.080 --> 14:11.640]  before the radio and TV convention the outgoing attorney general who never left
[14:11.640 --> 14:18.920]  he resigned six eight months ago about eight months ago wasn't it he said we
[14:18.920 --> 14:22.560]  need to literally brainwash people and be repetitive and never stop with our
[14:22.560 --> 14:28.080]  message on guns and what's that that guns don't save lives that guns are evil
[14:28.080 --> 14:35.000]  that guns kill children that guns of the problem not corrupt bad people so
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.040]  guaranteed they had meetings when they said what's the theme this year you can
[14:39.040 --> 14:44.400]  see the theme everywhere it's just every dad in a TV show is a gibbering idiot
[14:44.400 --> 14:51.040]  sitcoms cartoons men in general are bad men in general are scum men in general
[14:51.040 --> 14:54.760]  have nothing to offer and then men began to see that image and think that's what's
[14:54.760 --> 15:01.520]  manly and begin to mimic it and so women get to be alone and work two three
[15:01.520 --> 15:07.160]  jobs and die alone there is no team there is no children or if there are
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.000]  children mommy raises them and your kids are three to five times were likely
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.240]  to be on drugs or in prison but so what what are you attacking a single mom now
[15:15.240 --> 15:19.000]  see they've got it all set up or you can't even point out they're trying to
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.920]  destroy the human system the human nuclear family disdaining it is something
[15:23.920 --> 15:31.600]  disgusting and bad because the state wants to be the father LFA everybody else
[15:31.600 --> 15:39.000]  is the state's hoe and we're all to be pimped out men are to be emasculated
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.160]  women are to be destroyed in their powerful traditional genetic roles and
[15:44.160 --> 15:52.920]  reduce down to spies of the system bitter and unhappy believing if they just
[15:52.920 --> 15:56.880]  serve the system a little bit more that somehow Valhalla is just over the next
[15:56.880 --> 16:07.720]  hill so we'll look at always feminine products ad always like a girl Toyota my
[16:07.720 --> 16:11.760]  bold dad presented by the bold new Camry so they were giving their walking
[16:11.760 --> 16:16.000]  orders to put out these anti-dad messages so this is a twist on it he
[16:16.000 --> 16:21.000]  delivers his daughter and what I've said a thousand times to the state this is
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.240]  really about delivering your daughters to the state she raises her everything
[16:27.240 --> 16:35.240]  and then turns over to the state as she's got her combat bag on to be deployed
[16:35.240 --> 16:39.280]  to combat you don't get that bad when you're deployed to boot camp you get
[16:39.280 --> 16:46.760]  that at boot camp she's been deployed to combat just like private Lynch and they
[16:46.760 --> 16:50.280]  killed members of her team to cover up the truth since she coward and fear and
[16:50.280 --> 16:53.760]  later came out it was to sell women on joining the military and for frontline
[16:53.760 --> 16:57.760]  combat and that's only to get rid of frontline combat with humans that's
[16:57.760 --> 17:01.520]  only to wreck the military and bring in machines that are already out performing
[17:01.520 --> 17:06.960]  the drone pilots the announcements have now been made so Toyota did the only
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.040]  twist out of all the ads that looks like it's pro dad but only because he
[17:11.040 --> 17:20.800]  delivers her to the state as a sacrifice a virgin to the gods of war this is
[17:20.800 --> 17:27.280]  hardcore folks you want to talk about cabin in the woods this is it baby well
[17:27.280 --> 17:32.680]  I'm not delivering my daughters to the state or my son to be sacrificed on your
[17:32.680 --> 17:38.880]  bloody altar they're gonna defend humanity and if they have to I know
[17:38.880 --> 17:41.040]  they're gonna grow up straight and strong they'll do whatever it takes to defend
[17:41.040 --> 17:47.560]  humanity in the info war or beyond but we don't go join this system to them a
[17:47.560 --> 17:50.520]  given deadly vaccines then maybe put on enemies less as soon as they're out of
[17:50.520 --> 17:55.880]  the military and be put on death lists not be given medical care there's one
[17:55.880 --> 18:01.040]  thing still to sacrifice your sons to the state that's always been done but
[18:01.040 --> 18:06.960]  it's a new level to sacrifice the girls other cultures just won't give up their
[18:06.960 --> 18:12.160]  women only here in America is it a sacrament to do so on the bloody altar

[24:15.360 --> 24:21.280]  intro the start of the broadcast with that silent green boil down dovetailing
[24:21.280 --> 24:27.840]  the fictional dystopic science fiction movie from the 1970s starring Chuck
[24:27.840 --> 24:36.320]  Heston with real news clips concerning similar things now happening
[24:36.320 --> 24:46.480]  currently in real time that's the backdrop is that the so-called liberal
[24:46.480 --> 24:51.080]  spokespeople are always kill the troops kill the infirm kill the old people
[24:51.080 --> 24:59.080]  abort the babies in fantaside up to age three British Australian and US courts
[24:59.080 --> 25:04.880]  are saying pedophilia is normal and born that way that's an article out today
[25:04.880 --> 25:09.880]  so the new american magazine does this sound like group of people that care
[25:09.880 --> 25:14.040]  about the average person oh they'll dangle old people and kids in front of
[25:14.040 --> 25:18.560]  us to pull on our heartstrings to like oh do our agenda accept Obamacare
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.120]  except a victim disarmament except planetary government except social
[25:23.120 --> 25:28.640]  engineering is for the children and then we line up and do whatever they say
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.120]  but their psychopaths their control freaks they could care less they're
[25:33.120 --> 25:40.720]  punching our buttons laughing at us and saying oh here's a five ads during the
[25:40.720 --> 25:48.240]  Super Bowl about how dads should behave dads you need to be there more for your
[25:48.240 --> 25:55.280]  daughters dads you need to make your daughters join the military dads you know
[25:55.280 --> 26:05.480]  it's bad that you had a son on and on on there wasn't an ad about China killing
[26:05.480 --> 26:08.920]  tens of millions of newborn girls every year oh no no that'd be politically
[26:08.920 --> 26:13.760]  incorrect because that's a communist regime you don't criticize them so I'm
[26:13.760 --> 26:17.160]  gonna play these clips coming up in the next segment and do a whole report on
[26:17.160 --> 26:28.800]  this when feminism comes to the Super Bowl it looks like hashtag like a girl
[26:28.800 --> 26:32.760]  how about an article hashtag like a girl showing women being trained how to
[26:32.760 --> 26:37.600]  use firearms oh no no no no no no no no that's not how you empower a woman no
[26:37.600 --> 26:41.560]  no no no you don't empower a woman to understand how vital it is to find a
[26:41.560 --> 26:47.000]  male who understands the family is a survival unit designed to build wealth
[26:47.000 --> 26:51.520]  and strength and security and honor and that it's dishonor that's destroyed us
[26:51.520 --> 26:54.480]  and that this has been done scientifically when you understand it's
[26:54.480 --> 27:00.840]  been done scientifically how creepy is that and that the average woman's
[27:00.840 --> 27:06.240]  identity is thinking men are screwing them over and then the men have been
[27:06.240 --> 27:15.400]  taught to act like mindless thugs and watch football all day while we're all
[27:15.400 --> 27:21.040]  being ruled over so I want to open the phones up concerning the Super Bowl you
[27:21.040 --> 27:30.880]  can give us your take on it 800-259-9231 800-2599-231 we're gonna break down this
[27:30.880 --> 27:36.600]  information play these commercials and then take your calls then we're going
[27:36.600 --> 27:42.400]  to get into Obama says it's time to get vaccinated quote get your kids vaccinated
[27:42.400 --> 27:45.640]  trying to use this measles outbreak is a big hype that it's you people that
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.000]  didn't get vaccinated to cause this when it's clearly illegals pouring in
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.400]  that's even in mainstream news and those that have been vaccinated that are
[27:54.400 --> 27:57.840]  causing the measles if that's buried the articles that yeah these Disney
[27:57.840 --> 28:01.320]  workers have been vaccinated we don't know why they well they got it right
[28:01.320 --> 28:05.400]  after they got vaccinated well the stink and insert kind of like gasoline by a
[28:05.400 --> 28:09.760]  gas tank it says flammable don't have fire or smoke around this and you pull
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.440]  a cigarette out and light it when you're pouring gas you know and your gas
[28:14.440 --> 28:19.160]  taking it blows up and you wonder why it blows up I mean it says you can give
[28:19.160 --> 28:21.800]  you measles
[28:24.240 --> 28:30.760]  and so what if you get measles whoop-de-doo the vaccines are what you got
[28:30.760 --> 28:36.320]  to worry about historically and there's another video up on prisonplanet.com
[28:36.320 --> 28:42.240]  and info wars.com he's done it again video San diegans want pets covered under
[28:42.240 --> 28:46.560]  Obamacare and he says yeah you know people make $80,000 a year should pay
[28:46.560 --> 28:49.640]  for your pet and people are absolutely and they sign the petition wanting
[28:49.640 --> 28:54.760]  something free this is a monstrously dangerous because you got to understand
[28:54.760 --> 28:58.720]  he's not cherry picking you can go to any liberal area really authoritarian
[28:58.720 --> 29:05.200]  lazy blobs that's they're not really liberals and these people will sign to

[29:28.040 --> 29:31.240]  coming to help them they're gonna keep murdering them in mass that's why they
[29:31.240 --> 29:35.320]  got old people getting euthanized all over the west because folks don't care
[29:35.320 --> 29:40.960]  about each other the republicans can't even ban partial birth abortion and so

[33:07.120 --> 33:18.160]  rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones so the
[33:18.160 --> 33:23.960]  big thing with the Super Bowl this year was quote feminism and the
[33:23.960 --> 33:31.080]  establishment brand of that women being worshipped writing giant beast men
[33:31.080 --> 33:35.360]  bowing down to them fathers being told they're not doing enough for their
[33:35.360 --> 33:40.000]  children and their daughters and ad after ad it's systematic it's pre-planned
[33:40.000 --> 33:46.280]  it's pre-deployed and there's big backlash against it but the Super Bowl is
[33:46.280 --> 33:51.720]  one of the only places that still has a larger audience over a hundred million
[33:51.720 --> 33:55.760]  then you have every other major channel reporting on what happens during the
[33:55.760 --> 34:02.760]  Super Bowl so it has that amplification factor but to be clear this is not
[34:02.760 --> 34:06.560]  feminism about empowering women it's about ensuring that they're all forced
[34:06.560 --> 34:13.760]  into the workforce so they can pay taxes so families can be broken up and so
[34:13.760 --> 34:20.120]  children can become basically wards that are raised by the state and by the
[34:20.120 --> 34:27.680]  iPhones and droid tablets that are in the news today in a major pediatric
[34:27.680 --> 34:34.040]  journal brain damaging children just one more to legions of studies this is a
[34:34.040 --> 34:40.080]  scientific takeover meanwhile you take the political correctness of zero
[34:40.080 --> 34:45.800]  tolerance in a Texas town this is in New York Daily News we have an article up
[34:45.800 --> 34:52.280]  on info wars.com fourth grader says he has the one ring school suspends him for
[34:52.280 --> 34:57.560]  terrorist threat dad says Texas boys suspended for saying he could make

[35:06.320 --> 35:14.920]  sweet as you could ever be the ring little Aiden brought to school may have
[35:14.920 --> 35:18.960]  been the true ring of power but it had enough controversy to get him suspended
[35:18.960 --> 35:26.840]  from Kermit Texas school that's right Tolkien lore led Texas boy to
[35:26.840 --> 35:30.880]  suspension after he brought his one ring to school he wanted to come and play

[35:49.680 --> 35:54.320]  you can see of a magic ring that can make you disappear that's a threat see
[35:54.320 --> 35:58.000]  it's mind control an obsessed weird country where you don't know reading
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.720]  writing or arithmetic you don't know who the founders were you don't know
[36:00.720 --> 36:04.760]  common sense don't know what due process is but you know that's a threat so
[36:04.760 --> 36:09.560]  you've got a magic ring you're kicked out of school you're like well that's
[36:09.560 --> 36:17.520]  crazy that's over the top no it's not it's totalitarianism again we've seen
[36:17.520 --> 36:20.320]  many cases where kids are seen playing with nerf guns in their front or
[36:20.320 --> 36:24.440]  backyard the neighbor calls the school and they're suspended saying it's
[36:24.440 --> 36:28.800]  against policy even though the policy isn't law and it doesn't extend to your
[36:28.800 --> 36:36.280]  home fourth graders suspended for bringing nerf gun to the show and tell
[36:36.280 --> 36:40.800]  that's one article they found the other one was school suspends boy for playing
[36:40.800 --> 36:52.200]  with nerf gun at home it's a power grab people it's social engineering remember
[36:52.200 --> 36:55.960]  what the Attorney General said to the radio TV convention he said we need to
[36:55.960 --> 37:00.240]  brainwash the public and be repetitive and literally brainwash the public
[37:00.240 --> 37:06.120]  against the guns well they're doing it against the family as well creating some
[37:06.120 --> 37:11.520]  ideas men and women husbands and wives grandparents sit around I mean there I
[37:11.520 --> 37:19.200]  am with my mom my dad the kids the family and we've eaten dinner and we're
[37:19.200 --> 37:25.920]  watching the second half of the Super Bowl and I'm pointing out propaganda and
[37:25.920 --> 37:34.040]  all this occultic garbage and it's just attacking us the it's attacking the
[37:34.040 --> 37:39.960]  human unit that it knows it's trying to suck in I mean my grandmothers knew
[37:39.960 --> 37:44.000]  that the world didn't care about their families and that family came first and
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.120]  it was an operation where people built each other up and my grandfathers would
[37:48.120 --> 37:50.840]  do anything for their wives and they do anything for their husbands and they
[37:50.840 --> 37:57.520]  were on a team and they were cool and they had their act together they wanted
[37:57.520 --> 38:01.240]  their sons and daughters to be strong they wanted them to be successful and
[38:01.240 --> 38:05.440]  honorable and I look at women today compared to my
[38:05.440 --> 38:10.360]  grandmothers they're a joke they're a joke on average I had one girl they're
[38:10.360 --> 38:16.680]  still alive at 90 years old but just smart tough as nails sweet at the same
[38:16.680 --> 38:21.880]  time very feminine but very strong and not screwed up realizing that they
[38:21.880 --> 38:31.840]  were there to hold a family together and now the average woman thinks she's on
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.480]  some football team against men when men are out of the game brainwashed brain
[38:36.480 --> 38:41.800]  damaged totally destroyed arrested development gone watch any of these
[38:41.800 --> 38:46.640]  shows the idiot guy gets the girls which is another world works and the
[38:46.640 --> 38:53.960]  dad's always a moron and lazy we all laugh at that and think it's funny and
[38:53.960 --> 38:57.080]  they start out with images that are adorable like an Archie bunker by the
[38:57.080 --> 39:00.840]  time they're done with it it's married with children and then now the dads
[39:00.840 --> 39:06.120]  every show are a complete joke a complete fool and mom runs the show and
[39:06.120 --> 39:11.800]  mom does what the state says Gloria Steinem in her book admitted and it was
[39:11.800 --> 39:17.200]  declassified that Miss magazine was started by the CIA to break up families
[39:17.200 --> 39:22.280]  and to make women feel guilty if they wanted to raise the children and run the
[39:22.280 --> 39:25.960]  house that's the cave that's the base that's everything that is what you're
[39:25.960 --> 39:30.680]  going to work to get money to fund and now they're reversing it saying dads
[39:30.680 --> 39:34.400]  need to come in and help with the kids more and mom's gonna be the executive
[39:34.400 --> 39:40.520]  and in most cases now 65% of college graduates are women most the low level
[39:40.520 --> 39:44.800]  and middle level executive jobs are now going to women by design and then they
[39:44.800 --> 39:49.480]  go out and they all have artist boyfriends who are gonna make it someday
[39:49.480 --> 39:52.960]  baby never buy them anything never take care of them and the woman sits there
[39:52.960 --> 39:57.920]  and treats them like a little boy even if they have a kid he's he's he's a
[39:57.920 --> 40:03.680]  little boy and she and it gives him the money and just like I saw growing up in
[40:03.680 --> 40:09.320]  the black communities when I'd go over to my black friends houses in nice
[40:09.320 --> 40:16.480]  neighborhoods but also in the projects football baseball you name it and I
[40:16.480 --> 40:19.760]  just remember like you never saw a dad around and sometimes dad would show up
[40:19.760 --> 40:23.760]  from work he'd usually live with his mom down the street and then he would
[40:23.760 --> 40:29.000]  come and give part of his money to the mama who was the boss and that's if he
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.560]  even worked or wasn't in prison and now that's the model and you see these
[40:33.560 --> 40:37.480]  totally unfulfilled women freaked out by the time they had about 40 they start
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.040]  looking for a real man and let me tell you they're in many of them
[40:44.600 --> 40:51.880]  you've been biologically robbed I hope you enjoy it because it's only the
[40:51.880 --> 40:55.800]  beginning they robbed you everything you could have been everything you would
[40:55.800 --> 41:02.480]  have been women are what empowers men and what empowers civilizations and you
[41:02.480 --> 41:06.960]  take women out you take down the civilization women are the heart the
[41:06.960 --> 41:13.760]  beating heart of humanity and look what's been done to him oh we got a good
[41:13.760 --> 41:22.520]  we got some free Obamacare for you it's always a free ride isn't it think you
[41:22.520 --> 41:25.280]  got that free ride
[41:26.840 --> 41:31.840]  think you got some free vaccines got some free birth control at Planned
[41:31.840 --> 41:39.880]  Parenthood before you take those sub dermal time-release drugs need to look
[41:39.880 --> 41:43.960]  into what they really do to you I'm not even gonna tell what they do to you go
[41:43.960 --> 41:50.120]  look it up just find out you're not getting a free ride just like the black
[41:50.120 --> 41:54.160]  community signed on to the great society and liberalism and it's more than
[41:54.160 --> 42:04.040]  quadrupled illegitimacy cut the jobless rate it's expanded it's doubled total
[42:04.040 --> 42:09.800]  breakdown you think that was all just a little accident this is a scientific
[42:09.800 --> 42:14.280]  plan I want to go to your phone calls at first let's play some of these clips
[42:14.280 --> 42:24.280]  let's play the always like a girl ad by always which is again a feminine
[42:24.280 --> 42:28.560]  hygiene product which implies that men everywhere are insulting each other
[42:28.560 --> 42:34.680]  saying you're like a girl when I have really probably never heard this
[42:34.680 --> 42:39.120]  statement other than Hollywood movies and notice they're always the one hyping
[42:39.120 --> 42:48.040]  racism and sexism in movies like it's really going on so here it is you tune
[42:48.040 --> 42:51.080]  in and this is what you're bombarded with in a unified and then the halftime
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.040]  show matches it all unified propaganda that's the big takeaway here you're
[42:55.040 --> 43:02.600]  being propagandized let's go to that clip show me what it looks like to run
[43:02.600 --> 43:15.880]  like a girl here show me what it looks like to fight like a girl now throw like
[43:15.880 --> 43:24.240]  a girl so do you think you just insulted your sister no I mean yeah
[43:24.240 --> 43:32.080]  insulted bad man bad man my name is Dakota and I'm 10 years old show me what
[43:32.080 --> 43:35.560]  it looks like to run like a girl
[43:35.560 --> 43:41.440]  oh see women have value throw like this epic music oh my gosh fight like a girl
[43:41.440 --> 43:46.520]  and the states empowering it's gonna take good care of you just what does it mean
[43:46.520 --> 43:54.480]  to you when I say run like a girl it means run fast as you can how about run
[43:54.480 --> 44:02.520]  like a human rewrite the rules there you go don't worry they're rewriting the
[44:02.520 --> 44:07.800]  rules the end of humanity is here could humans come together realize the divide
[44:07.800 --> 44:13.080]  realize the manipulation I don't know it's too fun to hear the epic music of
[44:13.080 --> 44:19.840]  the bad boys that want to suppress the little girls creating guilt in them so
[44:19.840 --> 44:26.000]  they'll do what they're told by the women who are the policemen of the state the
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.880]  social engineers I mean it's a fact I've read Bernays books I've read the white
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.360]  papers I've made films on it the film in game this is what's going on now this
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.720]  is a twist on it because Toyota's told this is your job you know make it about
[44:38.720 --> 44:46.360]  moms and dads make it about girls make that the focus and so Toyota comes out
[44:46.360 --> 44:49.480]  with his great dad that raises this great girl but then he delivers her with
[44:49.480 --> 44:55.000]  her combat bag to deploy to combat so he deploys her to be sacrificed directly
[44:55.000 --> 45:02.760]  to the state in the final twilight of humanity as we're being phased out we're
[45:02.760 --> 45:06.400]  now going to throw our girls down the garbage disposal of these illegal wars
[45:06.400 --> 45:12.480]  let's go to that clip being a dad is more than being a father it's a
[45:12.480 --> 45:21.400]  commitment one that will make a wonderful human being who will make
[45:21.400 --> 45:26.880]  their own choices someday that's right never direct your children in any way
[45:26.880 --> 45:31.240]  never teach you any knowledge you were handed down cut that off now don't tell
[45:31.240 --> 45:34.400]  children anything you learned let the state in the media that's what the
[45:34.400 --> 45:37.560]  media always says don't tell your kids what to believe don't tell them what to
[45:37.560 --> 45:43.000]  think don't what but but the media is the Super Bowl ads are the public
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.640]  school is going to teach a six-year-old how to how to fist sorry to use a term
[45:47.640 --> 45:54.000]  like that that's what they teach them in public school how to masturbate but see
[45:54.000 --> 45:59.680]  oh don't don't no no no you let the system program your kids you don't say
[45:59.680 --> 46:04.200]  anything to them think about how creepy this is let's go to the next one all
[46:04.200 --> 46:13.880]  emotional here's the Nissan ad with dad see dad's not home enough during this
[46:13.880 --> 46:20.360]  one-minute 30-second ad dad's bad dad's bad but it doesn't matter he still gets
[46:20.360 --> 46:22.920]  a car that makes it okay here's here's the Nissan
[46:22.920 --> 46:38.240]  ride just the other day and he was talking for a new it and as it grew he'd
[46:38.240 --> 46:42.960]  say I'm gonna be like you oh he drives away he's not there he's an ass car
[46:42.960 --> 46:53.560]  driver he's a bold man but that hurts the child
[46:53.560 --> 47:11.120]  so terrible that his dad wasn't there for him and stabs of the reason
[47:11.120 --> 47:30.040]  why dad's out there winning but he's not there over his child
[47:30.040 --> 47:44.920]  told about guilt dad's guilty but he takes his son and basically he's about to
[47:44.920 --> 47:50.560]  be 16 he's gonna give him that car it's all unseb you can tell it's alright he
[47:50.560 --> 47:56.640]  gives them a car it makes it alright very sophisticated ads because again it's
[47:56.640 --> 48:01.120]  not enough that men are out there busting their butt working so hard you know
[48:01.120 --> 48:05.360]  why companies want men you know why men sell the ships and get all that because
[48:05.360 --> 48:11.960]  when men start dying men can continue operating men's brains are designed that
[48:11.960 --> 48:17.680]  way and we'll stay on task women are designed to be able to take care of
[48:17.680 --> 48:25.480]  children and to process things and to try to have a happy society but they're
[48:25.480 --> 48:31.120]  ending that whole world and so they have to even attack men for going out and
[48:31.120 --> 48:36.400]  sacrificing and working so hard and staying at those jobs they call it a
[48:36.400 --> 48:41.200]  glass ceiling because statistically women are paid 20% less than men it's
[48:41.200 --> 48:46.080]  because women generally want to quit and have children and it's because women
[48:46.080 --> 48:49.880]  want to take more vacation and statistically women don't want to stay
[48:49.880 --> 48:55.560]  as late and I don't blame them it's men that are meant to go out and not sleep
[48:55.560 --> 48:59.360]  for three days chasing down mastodons to run them over the side of a cliff to
[48:59.360 --> 49:03.920]  haul back enough dried meat that everybody survives to the winner I
[49:04.800 --> 49:08.040]  mean you understand the journey that men and women have been through on this
[49:08.040 --> 49:12.200]  planet everything we did working together to survive and then they claim
[49:12.200 --> 49:16.440]  it's all about men suppressing women and all about this great oppression when
[49:16.440 --> 49:21.600]  when women love their sons and their daughters and fathers love their sons
[49:21.600 --> 49:28.680]  and daughters in every culture men were more valued on the surface because they
[49:28.680 --> 49:33.800]  stayed part of your clan or your group and you love them so much you didn't
[49:33.800 --> 49:38.520]  want to lose them but if you had a daughter they would then go join another
[49:38.520 --> 49:44.200]  group and leave you and why did every society have that system because it's
[49:44.200 --> 49:48.560]  the only one that worked ladies and gentlemen and the establishment is
[49:48.560 --> 49:53.640]  destroying it and notice societies falling apart we're gonna go to break and
[49:53.640 --> 49:58.320]  talk to Mark John Joe indigo kid and others that are patiently holding I'm

[56:02.160 --> 56:06.120]  point to all the listeners out there God bless everybody that's out there by the
[56:06.120 --> 56:14.400]  way the ultimate designer is Satan and all of this and it's pretty obvious in
[56:14.400 --> 56:19.200]  in the in the later chapters of Matthew where he gets to talking about you just
[56:19.200 --> 56:24.440]  talking and describing and saying you know a house divided cannot stand and
[56:24.440 --> 56:28.960]  that's the root cause of all these problems and and you take that and you
[56:28.960 --> 56:33.640]  look at some of the I guess you'd say their prophecies that he's talking
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.280]  about looking for an end of you know fathers will be against their kids
[56:38.280 --> 56:42.520]  children will be against their parents it's gonna be this all-out you know

[56:50.280 --> 56:53.960]  overtaxed I forget which part of the Bible that is we ought to find that
[56:53.960 --> 56:58.440]  verse Bible verse your children will fight against you and it'll pull it up
[56:58.440 --> 57:02.640]  but but it's absolutely what happens when we enter into this zone appreciate
[57:02.640 --> 57:07.440]  your call mark good points let's talk to John in New Jersey he wants to talk
[57:07.440 --> 57:15.840]  Super Bowl Alex hey go ahead I haven't watched the NFL since they wouldn't let
[57:15.840 --> 57:21.520]  Rush Limbaugh buy in a portion of the St. Louis Rams it was full of baloney but
[57:21.520 --> 57:25.640]  the best thing about last night was I had in four wars to listen to in the
[57:25.640 --> 57:30.120]  meantime and that was great that you were broadcasting there were you know I
[57:30.120 --> 57:35.760]  started listening to you a year ago when you did your piece on Michael Savages
[57:35.760 --> 57:40.920]  program when the Ukrainians and the Russians were coming into each other
[57:40.920 --> 57:44.400]  over Crimea and I was so impressed with your knowledge that I've been a
[57:44.400 --> 57:49.160]  listener ever since and I just got a couple of things one is I want to
[57:49.160 --> 57:54.560]  compliment Rob do on his tech portions on the nightly news man they're great
[57:54.560 --> 58:01.080]  thank you the other thing is that I'm curious as to why such little references
[58:01.080 --> 58:05.840]  made to the revolution in the Philippines that you know the whole
[58:05.840 --> 58:11.120]  society came against Marcos and his abuse of his power and they did it
[58:11.120 --> 58:18.640]  without any bloodshed and it seemed like that should be elevated as a as a as an
[58:18.640 --> 58:23.360]  example because you're getting through man I mean I'm sure there are a lot of
[58:23.360 --> 58:28.240]  people like me that that would rather have listened to info wars last night
[58:28.240 --> 58:33.960]  and in the nightly broadcast on Sunday rather than watch the rather than watch
[58:33.960 --> 58:37.440]  the football game that's a good point we should look at revolutions that have
[58:37.440 --> 58:41.960]  been successful thank you so much John Joe Indico kid and others calls are

[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:26.800]  Alex Jones very simple we're gonna be conquered by the scientific technological
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:32.240]  elite that President Eisenhower warned us about this farewell address he said
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:36.120]  a technological elite that controls the military industrial complex they always
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:41.160]  cut that part out if we're aware of their operations and if we come together
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:46.920]  on basic issues and stop infighting it's over for them that's why we can't have a
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.640]  peaceful revolution is we're too busy fighting with each other
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.040]  there were no more white people there'd be no problems no more black people
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.320]  there'd be no more problems why the men weren't oppressing the women there'd be
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:06.120]  no more problems it's the same story but the average person is all aware of that
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:11.440]  and obsessed with that but they're not obsessed with central banking and how
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.640]  these elites get free money and we don't I mean there's all these other big
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.080]  issues that are the meat and potatoes of other world works and the average man or
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.920]  woman just knows all the political correctness even if you don't agree with
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:31.360]  it you still know it and it's still there Joe in Mississippi thanks for calling
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:38.200]  go ahead hey Alex it's very convenient that the system is pushing all this
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:44.360]  vaccine stuff at this time especially with the Disney outbreak and you know
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:50.240]  it's not a law or anything except for in Mississippi and West Virginia the only
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:57.600]  exemption you can get is a medical exemption and it's having an effect on a
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.720]  group here in Mississippi trying to get the law changed to have a philosophical
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.080]  exemption
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.400]  absolutely
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:15.080]  yeah and the it takes almost an act of Congress to get the medical exemption
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:22.680]  here in the state of Mississippi and there's a recording of one of these
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:27.840]  officials and he's very vitriolic he's like whether you want your
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:34.640]  egyptian or not it's ridiculous and so all this stuff comes up you know never
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:39.520]  month sick of hearing all these people parroting all this garbage you know
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.280]  never mind that half of them almost half the people at the Disney outbreak were
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:51.960]  vaccinated you know it's hateful not to have a philosophical exemption well
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.280]  that's what we've got to do is get back in their face as they're trying to bully
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:01.360]  us again on guns on dads are bad on vaccines it's all part of this bullying
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.840]  and trying to get a bunch of idiots to get all hyped up and to get in our face
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:13.200]  great point appreciate your call indigo kid you're on the year welcome welcome
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:19.280]  sir go ahead um I saw that picture of Katie Perry on your guys site where she's
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.080]  like dressed in the flames and you have the guys of the robots that's pretty much
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:28.040]  me trying to blend transhumanism with the wussifarianism and you look at the
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.520]  transhumanist perspective globalism seems to be like they want you basically
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.240]  to start a hate group to save the environment they want to like make you
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:42.160]  into a biological Android so you propagate their propaganda but I don't
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.240]  think that really works personally because you don't have to create a
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:51.240]  spirit behind you to actually create something that's real so it's just a
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:56.000]  reason but I wrote a quick quote I wanted to read uh just to go to watch that
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.360]  movie that you're a part of state of mind the other night I've watched it a
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.240]  couple times and there it is the enemy of the state may appear as a rugged
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.680]  individual but true radicals are those who worship the state with which seeks
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:15.000]  to devour those within proximity using their displaced sense of self-sacrifice
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.840]  as slow-burning fuel comprised of trafficked souls considered to be
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:25.960]  human resources and I say displaced rather than misplaced displaced and
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:30.960]  self-sacrifice because you look at the Tavistock Institute over the whole
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.000]  prussian model of a indoctrination or out an education yeah Pavlovian robots
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.480]  they admit they were trying to build robots and they were pretty much
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.480]  successful and that's what this is this is a human rebellion against being
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:48.880]  turned into a robot a drudgereport.com has some huge breaking news that I'm

[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.760]  tipsters
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.800]  that they bring the illegals in by the millions every year
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.840]  load them on buses give them vouchers
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.440]  and then send them to democrat-controlled areas
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:59.000]  where each family's paid seven thousand dollars a month or at some cases eight
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.480]  thousand dollars a month
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.800]  to take
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.080]  three illegals and then get them all their fake ideas
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.240]  then the feds give them work permits and actually hire them
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.160]  in many cases the feds hire them themselves
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:17.360]  there's the headline with video city official admits border patrol fronting
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.840]  cash to bus illegals

[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:19.680]  2009 18 million see they should always say
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.440]  there's 15 million legals or no no the from eyes we've been told it's more
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.440]  like 35 40 million and ladies and gentlemen this is just the
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:33.520]  beginning as the third world collapses in five years
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:40.160]  18 plus millions so far 18 million foreign students and
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.480]  workers including many university trained workers
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.920]  have jumped to the u.s economy since obama was inaugurated
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.760]  and in almost every case they just issue it in a
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:55.040]  secret shadow immigration system is the quote in the document
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.360]  shadow immigration system see they have to comply with all these foreign
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.360]  un treaties just like the pacific partnership they're
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.880]  trying to ram through secretly right now
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.880]  and that's their excuse oh well we have a treaty let's keep it secret so it's a
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:16.320]  whole giant secret government we were told in january by border
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.840]  patrol that illegals were being brought in
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:23.680]  and to get down to the border it took us three four months to get down there and
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.000]  document it
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:32.480]  can you imagine what else is going on here we are a year later
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:36.800]  and now we learn what we could already tell i remember it was about six years
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.600]  ago they had a bunch of fake meat packing plant
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.480]  raids where they arrested a couple thousand illegals
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:46.080]  and then it came out a few weeks later that the feds took them right to ice
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.680]  gave them green cards work permits and then drove them back
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.680]  a day later to the meat packing plants it was all
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.680]  for public consumption
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.960]  and i can't go to guatemala or nicaragua or
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:09.120]  nigeria or taiwan not a third world country but i can't go there and just
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.600]  instantly get free welfare have a baby for free
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:14.480]  everything taken care of and then these immigrants go and complain at the

[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.800]  this is probably old news you may have video of it yourself
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:35.600]  on the ukraine uh issue isn't the video that the the u.s uh
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.480]  citizen soldier east coast accidents and get out of my face

[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:57.760]  air uh that was actually that might be my fault uh i i was the one who suggested
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:00.560]  to their staff that he can't well i think i think we should have a little
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.160]  loose back on i don't agree with some of his ideas but i agree with his analysis
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:09.040]  it's a really smart interesting fella yeah i agree a lot with what he's
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:13.280]  saying i don't know if i agree with every little detail sure exactly but i mean
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:18.000]  what's your what's your point overall though that you wanted to make
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:25.920]  well he uh had he they sent me uh material videos in january of last
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:31.280]  year they had a uh a press conference i think it was
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:36.000]  with natalia vitrinco i believe it was in paris i think it was called the paris
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.200]  socialist party had this press conference and they showed video
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:47.840]  of these people who were from the ukraine uh how these neo-nazis had been
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.600]  trained to antagonize the ukrainian police and set
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:57.280]  you know throw molotov cocktails all types of stuff i mean it was very violent
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.720]  sure that all came out that the west funded all that
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:06.960]  yeah and uh and i'm guessing that it was george soros his money that went into
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.840]  that well soros brags that he quarterbacks the

[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.920]  get so sick of i don't even i don't even people ask me can you watch the super
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.480]  ball i said no i'm not going to watch that it's so corrupt as it is they
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.520]  look at me it's police state conditioning it's
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:53.440]  you know anti-family conditioning i mean it's just a total agenda
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:57.760]  that you'd get in some dystopic nightmare you know movie
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:03.520]  not in america and it just shows that you've got a dumb down population that's
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:08.560]  like lambs of the slaughter exactly oh did you get a report about the ceo
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.440]  the head of wounded warriors that is an anti-gun i heard it on this network
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:14.480]  this morning i'm gonna have to look into that but if
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.480]  it's true that's just unbelievable yeah just look into that have it when you
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:23.520]  report or something i know this there's specialty is conservative and libertarian
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:29.440]  groups that raise money and then it turns out it's going to anti-gun groups
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.240]  like when i first talked about that 20 years ago people didn't believe me about
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:37.440]  united way and uh red cross but now it's been in the news
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.680]  about half the money you give ends up going to basically globalist
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:47.360]  anti-family anti-gun pro-abortion stuff it's like the breast cancer societies
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.560]  and you know groups that end up being connected into the planned parenthood
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:56.160]  i mean they know how to siphon our money and red cross united way are some of
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.240]  the biggest funders of folks trying to take our guns and then you know
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.360]  there's my grandma writing checks to them and you know she doesn't know
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.920]  i gotta go tell her hey they're they're not good people
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.880]  i gotta show her news articles about it so uh i don't know that's true i'm not
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:15.360]  saying it isn't uh guys look into that wounded warrior ceo
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:19.840]  just search wounded warrior ceo uh anti-gunner but you know what it wouldn't
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:22.720]  surprise me i mean there's just no end to it
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:25.680]  they'd love to get vets to give money for other vets and then have it go to take
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.720]  our guns i mean that's exactly how they operate
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.440]  it's like bill clinton gets you know Haitian children money and then keeps it
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.120]  for gun control we ought to be pleased he keeps most of it
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.320]  for himself so just for gun control anything else so chris i guess you're

[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:53.040]  colderwar.com to break down his book sir thank you for coming on today
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.240]  i want to get into russia the inside baseball
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:59.440]  wear energy policies going what's happening with the oil war
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:03.520]  thank you so much for joining us my pleasure well you've got the floor
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.760]  start start breaking down where we are right now
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.760]  from an inside perspective alex it's very scary what
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.640]  the west america the european union they're starting to play russian roulette
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:17.920]  and putin is not backing down he's putting more forces
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.160]  to eastern ukraine and now obama's leaked some
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:27.520]  documents stating that the americans may supply lethal artillery and weapons and
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:30.960]  manpower so more boots more american boots
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:36.720]  more american weaponry in ukraine you don't want to put more
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.480]  sanctions on russia because now greece is vetoed these
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:43.760]  but more importantly the existing sanctions have pushed
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:48.480]  russia and china closer together than ever before they're doing
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:52.080]  hundreds of billions of dollars worth of deals the largest construction project
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:55.840]  in the world and all this is doing is uniting the russian
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.840]  bear and the chinese dragon and that is the worst possible outcome for america
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.440]  and the west it's a very bold strategy to send in cia
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:07.200]  commandos and others to be engaging the russians in combat the last six months
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:10.960]  that's basically admitted five billion to overthrow the ukrainian government
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:14.240]  i'm not again i don't have a dog in the fight here it's just clear the west is
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:19.040]  instituting and instigating all this sure they're hurting russia right now
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.320]  driving down the price of oil but long term this is a really dangerous game
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.280]  what do you think the western powers are thinking
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.960]  well it's all about the nato expansion is trying to expand europe
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:34.960]  the european union the e u is broke you know greece now
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:38.880]  a real insignificant country when you look in the global scale and by no means
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:42.400]  is a superpower is now dictating the terms of the
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:47.120]  sanctions against russia so you can see the european union is a basket case
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.280]  and you know america is now being drawn into this because of the e u
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:55.280]  and there really is nothing here positive for the average american here
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.640]  the ukraine conflict is getting worse it's going to get worse
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:03.440]  it's going to last longer and it's just going to be a drain on the u.s economy
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.560]  well in the west attacked russian held areas in georgia
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.640]  they miscalculated the russians poured in and threatened nuclear war in europe
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:16.000]  i mean if russia is not backing down and the west isn't backing down what are
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.120]  the policy makers thinking it's not like russia's on our southern
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:22.480]  border attacking us we're attacking them
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:26.080]  exactly in the worst part of this now you look at the russian population
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.480]  within the eastern ukraine they this is a secession war this is not a civil war
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.200]  and they want to join russia look at Crimea
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.040]  Putin is now hinted that because Crimea is now part of Russia
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:42.320]  they have the sovereign right to move their nuclear weapons to Crimea which
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:45.520]  is just on edge of europe so there's a lot of risks here the
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:49.200]  difference is the russian people are solely behind the slavic warrior
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:52.640]  Putin they defend what Putin is doing they are proud of what Putin is doing
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:55.280]  because they see him standing up against the west
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:58.160]  the question i have is obama's got two years left
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:01.920]  what is the future foreign policy here if the new president continues this
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:05.600]  failed foreign policy it's just going to be a lot worse for europe and
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:08.400]  the u.s and the russians here have nothing to lose they have an
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:12.000]  expansionary program and they're fit to fight and they are
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.680]  plan on fighting they're not going to back down so the question is is what's
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:19.920]  the west going to do now well they just push and push and push because
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:22.720]  the people running the west are not americans like
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.320]  like a john winner ronald reagan they want to export
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:30.160]  george soros tyranny back to russia they want socialism
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:33.200]  for the general public and their own crony system above it
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.520]  controlling it and they're turning al-qaeda loose all over the middle east
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.880]  what do you see in the grand strategy worldwide happening right now what's the
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:44.800]  grand strategy what's happening with the driving down oil prices
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.640]  break down your book for us the colder war how the global energy trade
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.880]  slip from america's grasp alex you're nailing all the most important parts
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:56.800]  here you know i find it shocking that obama and his wife go to saudi arabia
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:00.480]  and king salman the new king of saudi arabia in our book we have a chapter
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:04.560]  called the shaky house facade how come no one's really talking about the truth
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:09.600]  of who king salman he was funding the afghani extremists that the americans
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.920]  were fighting he was fighting he was funding
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:15.360]  the bosnian muslim extremists that the west fought against
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:18.640]  this is chaos and now they're trying to show him as a great leader is a
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.400]  moderate that is all false if you look into the past of king salman
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:26.080]  he was the finance here he was the point man for all of the funding of what
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:30.720]  today is isis isis is getting stronger obama came out today and said hey let's
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:33.360]  relax you know isis is not that big of a deal
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:38.320]  really ask the japanese if isis is a big deal or not isis is getting stronger
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.160]  the saudi arabia there's very vulnerable here the price of oil is
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:45.360]  collapsing the balkan the eagleford hundreds of billions of
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.680]  dollars of debt we haven't even seen the debt
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:50.800]  roll over in the u.s there's a lot of risk and the debt
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.840]  that is potentially to blow up in the u.s shale sector
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:57.360]  could be greater than what happened to the leeman brothers this is a huge risk
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:00.160]  at the same time to try to distract things with ukraine
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:04.320]  ukraine is really an insignificant what what does e u get it's the bread basket
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:07.840]  of eastern europe there's not much going on there other than major debt
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:10.720]  the cut ukraine owes over 18 billion to russia
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:15.520]  so there's a lot of problems i see worse uh controversy more
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:19.120]  uh death more wars more battles in the middle east i see
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:23.040]  eastern europe getting worse and more importantly the emerging markets are
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:27.040]  working together supporting putin look what china is doing
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:31.280]  against the western philosophy so there really is a battle between the old world
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.120]  order and the new world order and right now it's the new world order that is
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:39.440]  winning so when you say new world order you
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:43.360]  mean the people that run the u.s england europe uh you're saying they're
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.640]  winning no actually if you look at what's going
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:50.240]  on with china they are backing the russian you're saying that's the new
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:53.920]  new world order is that new world order they're calling for
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:58.240]  that's right the emerging markets because they want the lifestyle that the west
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:01.920]  has taken granted and they are going to work together against this
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:06.000]  and you know really one-third of all of america's debt is owned by china
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.240]  and china does not play by you know the un's rules if you look at all the
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:13.680]  voting uh on the un they've always backed russia
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:17.600]  where's india here there's a reason why obama's putting so much time to india
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:20.400]  historically india is going to line themselves up with russia
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.840]  who's really supplying the military of india it's russia
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:29.360]  china russia india the emerging markets are working together against the forces
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:32.800]  of europe western europe and america and right now if you see
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.440]  ukraine is a good example of what's going on
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:40.160]  you know you really who's winning here the russians are winning in the ukraine
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:45.360]  let me raise this point we see mainstream articles in the guardian out of
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:49.600]  davos where george soros is running around with
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.720]  his minions saying you better give a hundred trillion dollars to the imf and
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:56.080]  world bank to help poor people there's going to be a global uprising against
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:00.560]  wealth and the billionaires are running off the cook islands and new zealand
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:03.920]  and other areas building armored redoubts and private
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:07.760]  long airstrips and admitting it's because of this but then meanwhile
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:11.200]  soros is trying to stir up civil unrest everywhere
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:16.080]  what do you think's behind that well there's always an agenda where his
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:19.520]  investments going you know he there's no secret that he was the funder of the
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.360]  orange revolution the rose revolution in the early 2000s against
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:26.800]  russia this time is a bit different situation the russians are working
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:31.040]  together with china and their forces are going to be working against that
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:34.000]  so soros has his agenda where his investments are
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.040]  you know no one's asking is he trying to protect his investments
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:41.200]  you know there's no secret that soros has been a big investor in ukraine
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:44.640]  he's potentially there to lose billions of dollars so he's trying to use
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.080]  the governor's money to bail out his own investments so there's a lot of things
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:51.600]  behind the scenes that we don't see again in the middle east
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:54.720]  well that's right i mean he called for a marshal plan tens of billions of
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:57.680]  dollars to be given basically directly to him
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:02.640]  exactly it's the american taxpayer that is funding his investments
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:05.600]  well i mean i agree with you that up until about six months ago
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:10.240]  putin was beating the west and again i'm not lionizing him but putin's not here
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:13.440]  running things trying to take my guns and running ads everywhere saying fathers
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.360]  are bad i mean we got a really sick elite
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.880]  make no mistake uh but i'd take the real american system any day over what
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:22.080]  russia's got so i'm not rooting against america i'm just here looking at the
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:24.960]  tea leaves but now since the soddies and others
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:28.400]  slashed oil prices are i know your next part of energy to break that down for
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:31.280]  us it seems like it's really hurting russia hurting the
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:35.120]  rubble i mean in a football game it looks like
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:38.800]  uh the devil patriots are coming back a little bit
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:42.240]  well exactly what's key to understand here for russia why they are going to
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.360]  survive your first of all the world's largest crude oil producer but they
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.040]  produce in rubles and they sell in euros and us dollars
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:52.160]  so they won't experience the dutch disease when you're a petrol state when
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:56.000]  you're a real producer of oil the worst thing you want is a decreasing
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.080]  commodity price and a strengthening dollar so i will argue that the bokeh
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.600]  and the eagleford are experiencing dutch disease here because their costs are in
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:06.560]  us dollars and they sell in us dollars so what's
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:10.640]  this all about is international market share you got the arab gulf states you
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:14.080]  know saudi arabia kuwait ua e they are major producers and they're
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:17.440]  trying to increase their market share russia's a major producer they're
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:20.880]  trying to increase their market share and then the us shale sector has been
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:23.920]  hugely successful they're trying to bankrupt that
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.480]  exactly and this is a war against the us shale sector i put an article out that
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.480]  opec declared war on us thanksgiving day where all the analysts expected
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:36.320]  opec to cut production i said no way they are not going to put a cut production
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:40.160]  because they're declaring war on america because america was
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:45.040]  the largest consumer of the opec oil but now they're a competitor against the
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:48.080]  other u.s starting two years ago as the biggest producer in the world
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:51.440]  and for those that don't know this is in the economist this is in the financial
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:54.720]  times that are established from mouthpieces they admit saudi arabian
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:57.760]  opec are waging war on us just as they are on russia
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.000]  that's a perfect example of globalism you think america against russia no
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  or you think america against russia e you the e you's getting hurt the people
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.680]  are getting hurt by what's hurting russia this only helps a few
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:14.480]  insiders having all this unfold that's right and you know no one wants to talk
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:18.720]  about alex where did saudi arabia before they saw the collapse of oil they
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:22.000]  took billions of dollars positions on the short of oil
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.280]  the shorted american companies they shorted the u.s production
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:28.720]  and they made billions of dollars on the decrease of price of oil how come no
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.400]  one's talking about that it's amazing establishment
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.400]  publications admit it but uh you know these average people out there good
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:40.560]  hurt russia it doesn't help anybody for a major country to do bad folks
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:43.920]  that ends up pulling everybody down let me ask you this seeing this global
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.880]  recessionary trend intensify are you worried about deflationary inflationary
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:52.560]  and you agree that russia having trouble will hurt europe and then ultimately
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:57.040]  pull down the middle east and then the u.s i mean i i see this as a trigger
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:00.880]  event alex i think currently we are in a deflationary
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:04.800]  resource environment and deflation is the worst thing for country planners
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:08.240]  because when you have less money to play with you can't cover up look at the
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:10.640]  arab spring what does saudi arabia do to prevent any
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:13.760]  revolutionary they just created a lot of social program spending
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.520]  that ends in a deflationary market and deflation is very bad it's gonna
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:21.440]  what results from a deflationary environment is more global conflict
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:24.560]  and that's what's we see in europe that's what we see in the middle east
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:28.320]  and right now we haven't seen it yet in the u.s but with all of these job layoffs
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.840]  that are going to come in the high paying jobs of the bokeh we are in a new
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.240]  and deflationary environment which means more crisis globally are going to occur
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:40.080]  more battles more wars more deaths energy battles
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:43.680]  i mean you see russia now moving into the north pole discuss all this and more

[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:26.160]  with maren katissa chief energy strategist kasey research
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:30.640]  talking to folks out there in the mining industry in oil and gas
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:35.360]  how long do they expect this opec saudi led war against other independent
[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.240]  energy sectors to go i know the saudis have been funding the
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:42.320]  peak oil myth forever i know they've been funding uh these
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:45.680]  attacks on any other exploration they don't control
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:48.800]  i mean i don't want to just demonize these saudis but i mean come on the
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.520]  saudi government is a joke and the president bowing down to them's an
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:56.880]  even beggar joke and it just never seems to end well where
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:00.800]  does your gut tell you all of this craziness is going
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:03.920]  it's about market share alex and i think it's going to get worse and it's going
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:07.360]  to be longer what is going to win and what i believe is going to be
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:11.600]  prevail is the american innovation the shale sector the horizontal drilling
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:15.040]  the fracking uh that that is an american innovation i think
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:19.200]  innovation through necessity is what's going to prove and end up becoming the
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.360]  victor here because the differences we can rely on our own oil and gas
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:26.400]  production whereas the shaky house Assad or Kuwait
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:29.440]  you know these are basket cases waiting to be toppled
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:33.360]  and you can't rely on long-term supply and that is why
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:36.720]  china is aligning itself with russia for example they've
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:40.640]  inked they've doubled the amount of oil they're importing from russia in just
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:45.120]  the last four months because they know they can't rely on middle east oil
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:49.040]  so i think it's gonna you know the middle east is going the opec is going to
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:52.560]  flood the markets as much as they can they're not going to cut back production
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.400]  they're going to try to increase their market share and go against
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:00.240]  and fight create a war against the us shale sector
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.800]  that's right what do you expect to happen the short term medium term
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:08.720]  between the us being drug into this e you operation
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:11.360]  because i think that was disinfo and that tape got released to them saying
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:14.960]  forget the e you we want this war i mean it's the e you and the banksters that
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.880]  want to carve up ukraine there's not even a lot of us interest there
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:21.920]  exactly and i think this is just gonna drag in and it's
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:26.240]  it's going to be kind of a death spiral for america because you know the russians
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:29.600]  are ready to fight and i'm not sure obama understands that or
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:33.440]  understands the russian mentality yet and it's just going to get worse and it's
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:36.080]  going to be longer
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:38.880]  while the war planners certainly know that the russians don't give up when
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:42.880]  it's their own land to their own area i mean it's just
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:46.880]  it really makes me wonder about the arrogance of this elite
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:50.800]  definitely and you know we have to understand the west sees this as
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:54.480]  Putin invading eastern ukraine but to the average russian
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:58.960]  they believed Crimea was always theirs they believe that eastern ukraine
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:03.280]  is always theirs to the average russian they believe Kiev is their historical
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:07.040]  founding city so for the russians they're fighting for what they believe is
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:11.360]  theirs the west america the leaders in america today
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:14.800]  but don't understand that and i don't think they're prepared for what the
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:19.040]  russians are gonna put up here and and remember the russians are not afraid
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:22.640]  of rattling the nuclear weapons and Putin's talked about it publicly and
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:26.000]  this guy is you know he's ready to play russian roulette
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.480]  my question is is the eu-28 ready to uh fight Putin i don't know well you know
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:32.960]  the russians are going to start other stuff they're going to start poisoning
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:38.560]  people they're going to have asymmetrical sabotage stuff i mean if i was
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:42.880]  all these george soros people i mean that he's he's really got to be watching
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:45.840]  his back oh definitely not just george soros

[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:28.720]  state legislators considering more than 200 bills
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:33.520]  the block federal power and going back to our guests the author of the colder war
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.920]  maren katusa i see globalist oppression globalist
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:41.360]  domination forcing states county cities
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:45.360]  micro regions around the world to just stop complying
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:48.720]  i don't care how computerized their systems are i don't care how but
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:53.600]  pushy their surveillance is i've noticed that in the face
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:57.920]  of some of the technocrats personally we've just operated how we want to and
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:01.440]  done what we want to i think the big secret is folks don't
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:07.040]  realize the real power is in just doing it to steal a phrase from nike
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.880]  definitely you know like for example look at towns in canada the fort mac where
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:14.800]  all the oil sands major layoffs cutbacks and the billions of dollars
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:18.880]  these are really high employed jobs you know starting salaries for a truck
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:23.760]  driver at $35 an hour that bam those jobs notice canada suddenly isn't pro
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.360]  carbon tax exactly because now they can't afford it
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:30.240]  and you look at a country like even saudi arabia where
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:36.000]  50 percent of the males the shiai males even though it's a sunni majority
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  uh the majority in the oil producing region of shiites and 50 percent of the
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.240]  ages between 20 and 35 are unemployed that is a
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:47.680]  uh revolution just waiting for a catalyst so
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:50.960]  you're going to see as these higher unemployment rates come
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:53.840]  you're going to see more revolutions especially in the petrol states look at
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:58.880]  venezuela that's ready to pop uh there's a lot of problems globally
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:04.160]  no kidding and again who do you see being the winner long term in this
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:08.640]  i believe that if the politicians can stay out of the way of the energy sector
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:12.720]  it will be america because we have the innovation we have the
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:16.160]  intelligence we have the entrepreneurship the american dream is
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:19.840]  still alive in the oil patch it's the politicians it's the bureaucrats that
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:23.440]  get in the way with the red tape and i would put north
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:27.200]  america i'd put the canadians with the americans there i think the biggest
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:31.440]  losers are going to be the the monarchies and then you know the the old
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:37.760]  system saudi arabia kuwait they're waiting for a pin to pop that bubble
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:42.720]  looking at uh obama and the western establishment do you
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:45.760]  what's your view or what intel do you have on whether the saudi's
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:49.440]  and opic did this on their own or whether they had approval from the west to
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:57.040]  destroy the new energy sector uh led by shale i think that obama
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:02.080]  definitely didn't prevent them from creating this war on the shale
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:06.320]  sector you know obama's mandates really make no
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:10.240]  sense where certain areas when they were economic he shut the window for
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:14.080]  exploration now in the atlantic coast he's opening up areas that are
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:18.880]  uneconomics so obama's completely oblivious to the economics of the oil
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:23.280]  sector but saudi arabia really declared war on the shale sector and it's about
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:27.360]  market share spend a minute and a half on keystone i know you're an expert on that
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:30.480]  yeah well keystone look the key there is the jones act they're going to try to
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:33.440]  switch in which is going to be a big devastation for the
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:36.960]  us marine the jobs there's over two billion dollars in jobs there that you
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:40.240]  know they're going to bring in asian ships to ship the oil within the u.s
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:43.920]  ports uh but the problem with the keystone excel
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:47.360]  is they're going to increase shipping oil by a rail that's very dangerous for the
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:50.640]  american people number two rather than building new pipelines
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:53.600]  they're going to depend on old pipelines that were built when alvis presley was
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:56.560]  singing blue suede shoes that's also a big risk and now they've missed the
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:01.120]  window at forty five dollar oil you're not building any new pipelines
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:06.080]  so recession and infrastructure building exactly you know all the companies are
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:08.320]  pulling back on it and they've missed the window
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:12.240]  and warren buffett is highly invested along with george soros
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:16.080]  in the trains that are going to trans ship it out to the west coast of canada
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:20.480]  instead of coming to us and not only that warren buffett's the largest shareholder
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:23.840]  and the largest oil sands producer in canada that's going to ship that
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:27.920]  canadian heavy oil through the rail hold on hold on can you do five more minutes

[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:35.200]  floor to talk about george soros and and warren buffett and and how they
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:38.880]  killed keystone uh show that they could then ship the
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.560]  oil to china i mean it's just you want to know economics really works folks all
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:46.400]  the screw jobs work and it's always the same criminals
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:50.400]  it's always always the same turds uh we're going to have a final uh talk with

[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:29.120]  joe and maren katusa do another five minutes with us the cold
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:34.000]  colder war how the global energy trade slipped from america's grasp
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.200]  can't wait to read this book i've only scanned over it very informative
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.440]  and he is the chief energy strategist for kasey research also the leader and
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:45.600]  owner of one of the largest uh copper mines in canada
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:49.440]  one of those evil entrepreneurs that actually those out there and explores and
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:53.040]  builds things how horrible you're just supposed to
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:56.560]  fly around in jumbo jets on taxpayer expense with red carpets
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:59.600]  to give speeches about how poor people need to be more poor
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:04.880]  for the earth uh so maren uh is our guest for a few more minutes then we're
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:08.000]  going to go directly to your phone calls and a bunch of
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.600]  really important news i haven't gotten to yet
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:16.160]  but looking at this and looking at the keystone pipeline
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:21.040]  it's a microcosm that they've spent better part of a decade trying to block
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.040]  its construction and then not letting it open from canada down into texas
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:28.720]  to refineries the feds under bush and obama have blocked
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:32.960]  opening and corpus christi and other areas we have an open one new refinery
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:36.800]  in almost 30 years this is the deindustrialization
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:42.560]  model we're only select international ship zones can have new factories or
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:45.520]  facilities built and those of course are tax exempt
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:50.080]  and you've got the standard players like warren buffett and others
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:53.680]  with their tax-free foundations that own the railroads
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:57.760]  that would bring the oil to the west coast to be sold to china and japan
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:02.560]  instead of bringing canadian oil to the united states and to the gulf of
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:07.600]  mexico to ship the oil of the world uh and in almost every case
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:13.840]  art government bipartisan chooses the path that doesn't let america have
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:17.200]  any jobs so i guess we'll just go beyond welfare
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:21.280]  or have a government job or an entertainment job they don't want us
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:25.360]  having infrastructure another great example was a pacari the head of the
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:31.280]  un climate bureau would openly lobby to have british steel mill
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:34.080]  shut down and then the last one that they shut
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.920]  down was moved to india where he and his son owned it
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:41.360]  so people ask why are all these rich people for this
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:46.000]  because they can pick winners and losers they can shut off their competition
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.680]  and there's countless examples of this but congress could investigate warren
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:54.080]  buffett congress could stop this this is a national security issue
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:58.720]  when you've got a legal lawful safe new pipeline compared to the old ones
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:01.440]  much safer and they're trying to shut it off we're trying to shut off our
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:04.800]  coal plants they it's a bunch of rich insiders all
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:08.480]  day long trying to suppress everyone's industry but theirs
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:12.000]  but notice warren buffett could have been involved in a keystone
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.240]  pipeline and made money bringing well to america
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:18.720]  there is a fundamental hatred of this republic
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:21.600]  because they they hate our great grandparents they hate the people they
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:24.720]  couldn't control it's about dominating america and these
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:28.400]  elites want to have fights with people that are already dead
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:32.160]  even though they run this country they instinctively hate the west
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:36.480]  and want to destroy it that's my view on this give me your take on it
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:40.800]  maren and then i want you to break down the details of the keystone pipeline
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:43.760]  and and why people like warren buffett killed it
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:46.960]  well alex you bring up some great points here for example let's take warren
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:51.040]  buffett not only is the sole owner of uh berlington
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:55.680]  or santa fe which brings all the oil out of the oil sands to the us to the north
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:59.120]  to the west to the east but more importantly you know there's this
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:02.880]  misconception that this canadian oil is so dirty and it's bad
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:06.080]  but why is warren buffett the american legend in investing
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:10.080]  one of the largest shareholders of the the largest oil sand producing company
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:13.040]  called suncore and yet you know he's quietly moved in
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:16.160]  there and become a major shareholder and that
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:19.440]  oil now is controlled through the shipping of him and isn't it convenient
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:23.040]  that the pipeline isn't built because he wouldn't have as much control in his
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:26.560]  railways wouldn't be supplied now the growth of the rail
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:31.120]  uh shipping oil via rail is increased by over 20 times since warren buffett
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:34.720]  bought the railway is it a coincidence hell no
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:38.720]  number two you look at george soros you know he's trying to be seen as a you
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:43.040]  know a renaissance man globally he has quietly built up a position
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:48.400]  in the largest unuh hedged us uranium producer now that
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:52.080]  doesn't really fit his image but yet now he's getting into the us
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:55.280]  uranium sector through uranium energy corp and then he's become one of the
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:58.640]  major shareholders in that company so these guys have an image that they
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:01.840]  portray in public but what they're doing with their
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:04.960]  dollars is very different and they build up it quietly so that's something
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:07.680]  that's really important to understand what's important is they use their
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:11.840]  political control to then manipulate and not let their
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:15.840]  competition operate in the market that's right it's very unamerican what's
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:18.240]  going on here especially with the keystone xl which is
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:22.160]  it's not only environmentally safe for the environment for the people
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:25.600]  it makes all the sense economically it's all high paying jobs
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:28.960]  everything about it makes sense and most importantly let's get rid of
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:34.400]  the riskiest way to ship oil is by a rail okay it's 30 times more likely to
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:37.280]  have an accident shipping oil by a rail than a pipeline
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:40.720]  and let's get rid of these old pipelines that were built before the 1960s they
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:44.640]  were never designed to still keep control of moving the oil through these old
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:47.280]  pipelines i was about to say you can track this though
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:50.880]  it's the same usual suspects soros and others that are financing the well
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:54.640]  meaning hollywood people that go and tie themselves to the pipelines
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:57.840]  and say don't build them it hurts the earth oh you're gonna kill the caribou
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:01.040]  oh you're gonna kill this and that when those pipelines are just
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:06.720]  incredibly safe and good compared to to to trains
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:09.920]  not only that i i find it shocking how
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:14.560]  katar okay the world's largest lng producer
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:17.920]  financed the hollywood movie called broken promises which is
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:22.080]  anti us shale development it's mind boggling to me that they even allowed to
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:25.600]  do this and it's mind boggling to me a gas problem the world's largest gas
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:28.480]  producers telling europe and america that
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:31.680]  shale gas is bad you know come on let's really look at the facts here that
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:34.560]  katar really cares about america's environment
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:39.680]  hell no they don't want the us shale gas eating into their international
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:43.040]  market share that's what it's about but the propaganda
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:46.160]  coming through hollywood is just creating lies for the people
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:50.160]  amazing anything else we should know dealing with pipelines because it's not
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:53.280]  just these pipelines being shut down and you just mentioned how we're about to
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:57.040]  lose contracts for us ships to carry the oil up and down the
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:59.360]  rivers that will be given to chinese companies
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:03.520]  this country's being sold out right now alex i think what you're doing is where
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:06.720]  it starts just keep bringing the truth to people and eventually the truth will
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:09.760]  prevail uh stick with the american innovation
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:13.040]  we will do well it's going to be a battle but we will win
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:16.720]  all right folks you can find the book available

[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:48.960]  unrealistic on a tenable gate says well of course not they funded the stinking
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:51.920]  thing and then state legislators considering more than 200
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:55.760]  bills to block federal power that's some good news don't play lord of the
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:59.120]  ring at school and imagine your ring makes you invisible you might get kicked
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:02.880]  out of school or arrested uh right now because there's such a free country

[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:10.720]  hey alex how you doing today good thanks for holding brother
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:15.760]  okay uh i want to read something that was printed in 1897 by ex-secretary of the
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:19.840]  navy richard thompson about to be breaking down of the family unit
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:23.760]  yes it's been going on a long time this is what he said it's the only couple
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:30.560]  sentences apart from this governing authority universal equality prevailed
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:37.120]  the principles of socialism or communism very much as now understood
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:42.320]  governed all the reductions guess where that was at alex
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:49.680]  i don't know so paraguay that was a paraguay from 1600 to 1756
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:54.160]  and the reductions were ruled by the jesuit
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:59.200]  well do me a favor read to me that that quote again
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:04.480]  apart from this governing authority universally quality prevailed
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:08.560]  the principles of socialism or communism
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:13.520]  very much as now understood governed all the reductions
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:19.520]  that's on page 175 and the rest of the sentences on page 176
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:23.280]  where it says they had everything in common and men and women
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:30.240]  were equally trained become experts and they separated men women and children
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:34.640]  and indoctrinated the children separate from their parents
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:38.560]  and the priest became the parent yes i'm aware
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:43.760]  i'm aware that in uh plantations in the caribbean and central and south america
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:47.600]  as carried out by the catholic church at that time
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:53.120]  that the models that we see in the great society and the rest of it today
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:57.680]  even go back to ancient roman systems of control on
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:02.000]  plantations you have the spartakus you know uprising and the rest of it against
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.640]  that uh that's a real uprising that actually happened
[02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:09.040]  folks it's not just a stanley cubrick movie uh and and and yes to in the
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:13.040]  family unit uh with the plantation slaves they
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:18.320]  can call them slaves they just were slaves uh they would then have men in
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:23.280]  one area women in another and children in another just as north korea does
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:27.600]  so this is a model of enslavement that's been used for thousands of years
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:31.360]  there was a book written by sir thomas mor
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:35.280]  mori who was beheaded for his treason in england he was a
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:39.040]  Jesuit uh Jesuit co-juder that worked with uh the
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:43.760]  vatican to get control of england and he wrote a book called utopia
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:48.160]  that was used by the Jesuits to control 330 000
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:54.640]  grand indians over 150 years it took two combined armies from portugal and spain
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:59.040]  to take the Jesuits out of power in peregrine took them over two years to do
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:02.400]  it and then polemic the 14th outlawed the Jesuit
[02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:07.440]  order because of their corrupt activity in 1773
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:11.280]  no i knew that and you're not supposed to have a Jesuit as the pope either
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:14.400]  again i'm not a catholic basher it's a very diverse group of people
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:20.800]  but there's no doubt that this this new pope i mean might as well be
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:24.560]  i mean linen or something i mean it's just unbelievable i mean i and look the
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:27.200]  stuff he's saying is basically the opposite of the last pope so i don't
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:30.240]  want to hear all this business that i'm just bashing popes here
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:35.200]  i mean this guy is really pushing it and uh he's a
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:40.560]  admitted socialist Jesuit linenist marxist god help us i mean it's just on
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:43.440]  every front and you got off the protestant church is pushing the same
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:48.160]  garbage i mean evil is making its move that's all i know
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:51.840]  and i'm glad you brought that up yeah i was familiar with uh
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:55.440]  i've been down to the uh some of the missions of san Antonio and

[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:13.520]  there've been a lot of different systems to roam civilization to control
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:18.560]  populations and turn humans into nothing but barnyard animals
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:21.760]  we're only taught in the united states about black people
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:27.600]  being slaves because that's just a nice new way to divide and conquer and while
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:31.280]  you're busy focusing on that having hundreds of textbooks on that
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:35.680]  there's no textbooks out there on global slavery human management

[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:45.360]  these systems of control so that you're aware of it and when you see
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:49.600]  feminism pushed everywhere it's it's men against women so that women think they
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:53.520]  get ahead by men not getting ahead they don't want
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:25:00.320]  you thinking in a win-win mentality this is the essence of these parasites
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:06.160]  and look at this article all new female ghostbusters cast chosen
[02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:10.720]  well great if you had a hit movie a show like charlie's angels
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:16.240]  that was originally about women imagine if they came up with a new thing like
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:19.680]  charlie's angels and it's all guys no the message is
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:25.440]  it's bad that you had a male cast of course in a movie orbited around
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:30.240]  sagorni weaver as if of a movie and and i see these articles admitting that
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:33.520]  there's all this pressure to make sure in the rating system
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:38.480]  that you have women as the as as as the heroes
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:42.880]  i mean women are already heroes in a bunch of stuff
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:46.000]  but the point is is that it's so that women
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.000]  it's like uh different black groups wanting to have more black movies win
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.840]  oscars i mean as if that's the only world out
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:58.480]  there that in the entertainment you've got a i mean if people go out and see
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:01.280]  movies that are the types they like you'll see
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:04.960]  more of those movies it isn't oh let's put a whole cast of women in
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:08.080]  in fact i predict this this this ghostbusters movie gets hyped
[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:11.440]  gets pushed and that it's not a tenth as successful as the original
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:15.360]  because i know these women that are the these people aren't funny
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:20.400]  they're not as funny as the cast of ghostbusters i'm sorry
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:26.720]  but but there's an example of just everything is about feminism
[02:26:26.720 --> 02:26:30.880]  everything is about race because it doesn't matter it's a distraction
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:35.360]  well the real world is Warren Buffett shutting off a pipeline so he makes
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:40.640]  billions of dollars a month off of it off shipping it by train

[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:02.720]  like being cheated and they sat around reading the newspaper having
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:04.400]  discussions about what they were going to do
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:07.600]  they got mad when somebody tried to cheat them
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:10.720]  and they built a powerful civilization because they weren't chumps

[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:53.760]  the goddess writing in the fire goddess writing the big lion
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:59.360]  it ties into some of the highest levels of masonic masonry we have links to

[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:21.760]  or the secret that whatever you believe ends up happening
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:25.440]  and that happens to a certain extent if you then put it into action but
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:29.200]  when they get hundreds of millions of people watching something
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:36.960]  out of it they want a goal and they have themes and this theme was the goddess
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:43.280]  and the empowerment of women and women on top of things but that was only
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:47.040]  at a subliminal subconscious level the subconscious understands what these
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:49.840]  messages are without even having to decode them
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:53.520]  so that people would then buy whatever else was being said openly or
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:56.480]  subliminally which is joined with the new world order
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:00.640]  it will empower you it will give you salvation
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:05.840]  when it's not going to do that so whether it's the grammys or the emies or
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:10.880]  the super bowl they're almost all a cultic now
[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:20.480]  and it's all basically symbolizing you know where she flies around as a sperm
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:24.240]  it's a star with a tail then lands in the big egg and then out of it comes a big
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:28.000]  stage it's saying she's creating she's procreating
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:32.480]  she's building a world and at a fundamental level we see a beautiful
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:36.160]  young woman the image of the goddess the image of the virgin the
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:40.160]  image of the whore all wrapped together it's extremely
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:43.200]  powerful and all they're doing is programming
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:45.840]  archetypes here
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:51.920]  and then you see the commercials put your daughter in the military
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:58.240]  dads aren't good because they work you know being male and being strong
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:03.360]  hurts females
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:07.600]  i mean it's just a very toxic assault
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:13.440]  extremely toxic assault but there's a good breakdown of it an info wars.com
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:18.240]  whoever wrote it didn't put a name on it did a don write this
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:21.440]  or was it watson i want to find out who wrote this it was a don i guessed it
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:25.040]  okay i can tell he's writing subliminal super bowl lemonade secrets revealed
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:29.840]  pop singers admitted to selling soul to satan you might want to go read it
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.000]  and the message is men are just automatons men are just robots
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:38.000]  chess pieces and the goddess writing the great beast
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:45.040]  will control you and in the truth it'll just target women first
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:48.720]  the system hates creation the system hates life
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:54.880]  women are who the system's targeting first and foremost
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:59.680]  and men have turned the world over to evil men have let other wicked men
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:02.800]  sorcerers is what they are putting at the public under a trance
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:08.320]  a high-tech mind control trance a spell good men have allowed these these
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:11.120]  people to take over
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:15.280]  and if you're a christian a conservative a libertarian a gun owner
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:19.280]  an anti-fella reserve activist who is the pentagon trained to fight
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:23.360]  us now the military's really woken up they're like why are we trained to take
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:27.280]  on the good guys they get it but this is a world where they
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:30.880]  don't want women to be women men to be men and they claim that if you just
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:35.680]  exist as a heterosexual male or you exist as a heterosexual healthy female
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:40.000]  that that hurts other people that aren't into that and that and that you need to
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:44.320]  accept it and promote it or you're hurting them
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:48.080]  the truth is you've always had people that were quote genetically or naturally
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:51.760]  attracted to the same sex or whatever
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:56.000]  and historically when societies are about to collapse that
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:01.280]  intensifies for whatever reason
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:05.280]  but they're artificially pushing it they're artificially putting chemicals
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:10.560]  in food and water that are known to flip switches in the
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:16.160]  hypothalamus and other glands to make women hyper feminine and desire women
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:20.640]  and to basically make men desire men the pentagon was working on these
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:24.800]  chemicals and successfully developed what they call a gay bomb
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:28.160]  and the media always attacks me on this when i talk about it because they know
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:31.920]  i'm hitting right at the heart of their program
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:40.800]  frogs shrimp are becoming either asexual or bisexual
[02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:44.240]  and the end goal is
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:49.040]  asexual they don't want you to be sexual at all scientists develop gay bomb to
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:52.960]  make enemy soldiers stop fighting and make love
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:57.360]  and you can spray these chemicals on a man
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:01.360]  and uh within a few days they will begin to
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:05.520]  smell the pheromones of other men and it will trick them and they won't know
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:08.880]  why they're attracted to men i mean this is this is chemical warfare ladies and
[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:14.240]  gentlemen and just know you're under it
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:21.680]  be honest about it so much of this stuff runs off that
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:26.080]  they're worried about frog populations collapsing because
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:31.680]  it's just devastating and women you should worry about being hyper
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:34.560]  feminized because it makes your sexual organs
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:38.720]  accelerate their aging sometimes at about five times the pace
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:41.680]  usually just a doubling that's why you got 25 year old women getting breast
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:45.840]  cancer at record levels because you got the breast of an 80 year old woman
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:49.760]  genetically in the code they still look just fine
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:53.840]  men's prostate you're 50 you got the prostate of 100 year old men
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:57.280]  because these chemicals attack those tissues
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:01.200]  round up grows cancer is in them
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:08.000]  you spray this stuff on frogs folks male frogs start humping each other
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:11.200]  and they make all sorts of jokes a democratic party run stuff msnbc makes
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:13.920]  jokes out of it it didn't funny i'm going to tell the young
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:18.000]  Turks and people it's not funny if your 14 year old son gets
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.360]  testicular cancer it's not funny if your 20 year old
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:27.280]  daughter gets breast cancer this isn't a game this kills animals
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:30.640]  now you may think a bunch of tumors growing all over he's cute it's not
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:35.360]  cute so we're getting jacked with get jacked with
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:39.440]  heart used to puberty when women was average age 14 now
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:42.320]  it's about nine there are thousands of cases of
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:44.720]  three-year-olds and four-year-olds going into puberty
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:48.720]  the doctors don't ever say stop eating this stop eating that you know what
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:51.920]  chemicals you're exposed to they say we're going to give your daughter
[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:55.360]  chemicals to suppress her going into puberty
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:42:00.320]  now you might want to find out why four-year-olds are going into puberty
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:04.560]  or is it just easier to make a joke about it on msnbc or young Turks or
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:07.920]  whatever because it's not funny okay
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:11.200]  all of you laughing will be touched by this guaranteed so
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:16.400]  go ahead and laugh your butts off okay go ahead and laugh long and hard
[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:23.120]  don't ever say you weren't warned let's go to john and then we'll uh go to uh
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:26.880]  no no no first i want to go to net in oregon listening on kmed
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:32.640]  880am kmed i don't remember getting a call on kmed 880am
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:35.760]  i know it's one of our affiliates uh where are you located net how are you
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:40.080]  listening uh i'm listening on am radio and i'm uh
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:44.160]  i'm located in southern oregon medford area well please tell everybody about
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:48.400]  the show every day brother i do i tell everybody especially the police
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:52.560]  department fire departments everybody that's higher up that
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:55.600]  that is ignorant about what's going on i've tried to
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:43:00.880]  enlighten the lieutenants and the uh higher people up that's
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:04.640]  that can push the information around at those levels
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:08.000]  because i believe like you said that uh eventually
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:12.480]  those are going to be the trouble parts uh that's going to uh
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:15.600]  you know ignite maybe other problems down the road for
[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:19.680]  the civilization absolutely have you had any traction
[02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:24.640]  yes oh yes uh i want to say that the uh the police department i'm dealing with
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:27.360]  is the central point police department and they are
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:30.320]  very hip people they know about you and they know what's going on that's what
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:32.880]  i was about to say though that's what's incredible and i'll let you get to your
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:36.000]  point i don't know what it is that's why i said we shouldn't fight with the
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.080]  police even though there's major problems
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:42.400]  they are i'm not going to exaggerate 20 times easier to wake up than the
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:44.800]  general public because they're in there they know
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:48.240]  already a lot of this is true military 20 times easier
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:51.600]  and you have callers calling and going nobody will listen to me i guarantee
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:54.960]  you they're talking to a bunch of slobs i mean i'm not worried about people that
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:58.000]  want to suck their thumbs all day you can knock the police but at least they're
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.040]  out there engaging people they're in the real world
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:04.640]  and they're people that take action they are ready to hear the truth
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:08.160]  they usually already know what's going on and more than we know sometimes and so
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:12.400]  that's what i thought i'd hear you say because that's my experience no wonder
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:15.440]  george soros wants us to start fighting with them
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:18.880]  because if they can just get that animosity going
[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:23.840]  that piece of crap is going to win i believe so i want to say one thing
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:27.920]  before i continue on here i need to talk to somebody in your organization about
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:32.240]  the emerald tablets of cloth by the of the atlantican
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:36.880]  by doriel i just finished reading this and this explains a lot of about the
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:41.840]  reptilian race and uh and i just need to express this to some people in your
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:44.000]  organization very quickly here before i get
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:48.880]  off the air but um i wanted to talk about basically uh
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:53.840]  i just finished reading the uh time loop book by
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:57.440]  david eich deals from the time loop and in the appendix it talks about
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:00.560]  who really runs things and he he says that uh
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:03.840]  the both the bar association throughout the world and
[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:07.440]  of course all the legal systems the money systems everything is run by the
[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:10.960]  catholic church and uh the catholic church is the
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:15.280]  is the uh church of babelon and i just wanted to pray
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:18.960]  you know spend that along to you i know you know probably a lot about that too
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:22.160]  but i really need to talk to somebody off air about these emerald tablets
[02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:25.440]  okay i'll i'll i'll look at it i've heard that before but i want to look into it
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:28.800]  more thank you so much we'll put them on holding and tell tell john specifically
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:32.160]  when he wants to get across to us look
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:37.360]  it's evil it's systems of corruption if you single out and say it's the russians
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:40.560]  or it's the catholics or it's the americans or it's the blacks or it's the
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:43.680]  cops or it's the whites there are good people in every
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:47.280]  organization and group out there unless you're talking about
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:51.360]  you know stuff like the church of satan or some pedophile group or whatever
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:55.520]  uh you know really unsavory people that are openly into evil
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:59.440]  it is good people not being involved
[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:04.000]  and not standing up against garbage that allows evil to then take over every
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:07.280]  organization that's all i'm getting it because there's a real
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:11.280]  theme here to either bass jews or catholics with some of the callers and
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:14.880]  i just don't think it's productive i mean if you call in about the catholics
[02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:17.600]  and bring up you know the jesuit's run in plantations
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:21.680]  i've confirmed that it's historically true i'll cover it
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:25.360]  and yeah their type of leftist you know liberation creates horrible slavery
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:28.640]  i'm against it is there a big leftist movement the catholic church absolutely
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:30.720]  right there's a big right wing movement as well
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:36.480]  uh it's just things are complex i just oppose socialism fascism
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:40.480]  centralization tyranny bullies garbage oppression
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:44.080]  and then that's it and then i can get people across the board to agree on that
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:48.320]  the system wants us to choose groups i'm just here to promote a culture of
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:50.960]  liberty and then i think at the end of the day we
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:53.600]  can really build a better civilization if we do that
[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:57.600]  doesn't mean you have to agree with me but thank you for spreading the word on
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:02.080]  8 80 a.m there we've got over uh almost 180 affiliates
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:05.440]  and that's commercial m and fm stations we've got over
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:08.400]  several hundred micro fm's that are out there across the country want to
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:11.280]  salute all of them as well as long as they interfere with commercial
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:14.800]  broadcast uh and people want to take action you know that's
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:17.520]  something a lot of people are doing is they're getting into little fm kits
[02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:21.120]  they plug them into their internet they stream the show and i mean you know
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:23.680]  even if you just do it on with that quarter watt or something to your
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:26.640]  neighborhood and put up signs that you get the whole neighborhood listening
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:31.120]  it'll have such a big effect they got little am transmitters you name it
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:34.560]  it's really really exciting what people are doing vincen in mexico thanks for

[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:14.720]  the block federal land grabs obama care you name it

[02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:25.760]  that the states are starting to stand up continuing here obama came out last
[02:54:25.760 --> 02:54:29.200]  night and said get your kids vaccinated you should get your kids
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:33.760]  vaccinated it's good for them really it's good for them that's why the
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:38.080]  insert says it can kill them or causes permanent epilepsy narcolepsy
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:41.200]  guion beret i mean they just lie and say it's good
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:44.960]  no that's a load of bull at least tell them the side effects
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:48.400]  that side effects of the vaccines are good what about the stuff in there on
[02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:52.880]  purpose so let's go to that clip and do you feel
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:56.480]  there should be a requirement that parents get their kids vaccinated
[02:54:56.480 --> 02:55:01.360]  measles is preventable i understand that there are families that in some cases
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:04.720]  are concerned about the effect of vaccinations
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:09.040]  the science is you know pretty indisputable we've looked at this
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:14.400]  again uh-huh is every reason to get vaccinated
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:17.440]  there aren't reasons to not are you telling parents you should get your kids
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:20.560]  vaccinated you should get your kids vaccinated it's good for them but we
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:23.120]  should be able to get back to the point where
[02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:27.840]  measles effectively is not uh existing in this country
[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:32.080]  all right let's stop right there measles some red spots in the fever whoop-de-do
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:35.200]  i mean parents give so much Tylenol to their kids they're sick for two weeks
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:38.960]  with with a low-grade fever because you won't want them to just get over it
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:42.240]  yeah your kids got a hundred and four fever give them some Tylenol to control
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:45.840]  it but if it's a hundred and one let them have it
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:50.400]  that's not rocket science but notice it's safe and effective it's undisputed
[02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:53.520]  it's undisputed global warming is real it's undisputed the ice caps are going
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:55.440]  to melt it's undisputed you can keep your doctor
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:57.760]  it's undisputed raising the debt limit doesn't raise your debt limit i mean
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:03.120]  this is pure bull but it's just it's undisputed
[02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:07.120]  we know it's been looked at it's been looked at you made a secret
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:10.400]  vaccine payoff group with secret courts to cover up all the
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:14.480]  carnage they just sit up they're going oh everything's
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:18.880]  fine it's all a big confidence game i'm in the oval office believe me
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:22.560]  don't believe all those doctors and people warning you
[02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:27.280]  and now they're going into this full tilt push i mean rob do did a report two
[02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:30.240]  weeks ago on this and another one in mainstream news they admit
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:33.280]  we don't know why these are vaccinated people that have the measles
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:38.000]  the vaccine spreading it we show the stinking insert

[03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:56.160]  that uh we find it impossible for a man to have the helices in a cave
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:01:00.480]  for 10 years both prior to 9-11 and after
[03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:04.720]  without some sort of infection or death i just feel of course the official
[03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:09.120]  story is a total fable and he wasn't buried at sea and all that's come out
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:12.240]  it's just it's just as you're saying no one else you've talked to
[03:01:12.240 --> 03:01:17.040]  who works in that area says it's possible no it's it's impossible if you
[03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:19.760]  recall back in the 90s when clinton had the
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:23.920]  a chance to uh assassinate him in a hospital in the middle east
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:28.080]  he didn't do it the main reason is that he was there is most likely because his
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:32.160]  accesses were failing him which would lead me to believe that
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:37.120]  barring some sort of infection uh he never walked out of that place
[03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:41.760]  i was i highly yeah and that's that's what the cbs news reported months after uh
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:48.800]  pacenic broke that on air right and and i i think it's very
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:53.360]  i think unfortunately no one you know obviously and the official report or
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:57.600]  the official news reports come up no one ever focuses on that
[03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:01.200]  and i think that's that's something that could really uh
[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:04.320]  really wake a lot of people up especially in medicine they see how fragile
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:08.160]  these patients are well i mean sir shell phones don't work and i've done it
[03:02:08.160 --> 03:02:12.400]  scores of times above 3 000 feet they claim a bunch of people made calls at
[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:16.560]  30 plus thousand feet without air phones it's patent horse crap
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:20.240]  the two air phone calls we have are there's gas we can't breathe
[03:02:20.240 --> 03:02:23.680]  help us nothing about hijackers and nothing
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:26.640]  they nerve gas and remote control them into the towers
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:30.800]  and abs and then remember the solicitor general's wife supposedly died
[03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:34.240]  and she made called him and then the fbi went and checked and they admitted
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:38.160]  to their credit he never called her she never called him it wasn't
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:42.000]  true absolutely god bless you john do a video on it
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.720]  speak out i mean you're just as smart as i am or smarter
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:48.400]  all of you guys that have all the angles figured out fight with me
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:52.880]  yeah and i mean fight with me together we can do it uh izik in oklahoma thanks
[03:02:52.880 --> 03:02:56.720]  for calling go ahead uh hey alex
[03:02:56.720 --> 03:03:02.320]  hey brother hey uh how was it so listen to show uh last week about uh we were
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:05.920]  talking about the billboards yes sir i was thinking of a way on the info war
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:10.880]  store how we could uh donate like pretty easy i was thinking on the
[03:03:10.880 --> 03:03:14.000]  checkout screen to where you know say you pick your product and there's a
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:17.120]  plie coupon maybe have a section to say make a
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:21.760]  donation per billboard and you put in i remember you know what buckley said that
[03:03:21.760 --> 03:03:26.000]  and a bunch of callers have said that and a bunch of emails have come in i just
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.960]  don't like asking for money i like people to buy the products is how we fund
[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:31.840]  ourselves but you know what i will put up info wars
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:37.120]  dot com seek the truth billboards um in the cities in fact we're gonna put one
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:40.800]  up in austin and and and then if the money
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:44.640]  comes in we could start doing it in in cities that have affiliates
[03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:47.680]  and then that way have the website and their call letters
[03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:50.800]  and partner with those stations by partner they would have to pay any money
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:54.080]  we would just do that for the station and yes that's how clear channel built
[03:03:54.080 --> 03:03:56.400]  their empire and talk radio was with billboards
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:00.320]  and organically if the the average billboards about three thousand dollars
[03:04:00.320 --> 03:04:04.480]  for a pretty big one if we could at checkout say make a donation
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:08.400]  to put up billboards of a dollar to up to a hundred dollars that would be an
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:11.600]  awesome idea and and and so what so we will do it
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:17.600]  absolutely awesome awesome all right all right well thanks Alex thank you
