[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000] ...
[00:05.000 --> 00:10.000] ...
[00:10.000 --> 00:15.000] ...
[00:15.000 --> 00:19.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:19.000 --> 00:47.360]  It was 16 months ago that the head of the UN's Global Rapid Response Force,
[00:47.360 --> 00:54.840]  said the goal is to go into the homes and take people out who might have COVID and take them
[00:54.840 --> 01:00.680]  to emergency centers and to see the image of vans and basically paramilitary stormtroopers dressed
[01:00.680 --> 01:08.120]  up in medical gear as a cover, disappearing all of their political enemies. Then ventilators,
[01:08.120 --> 01:12.560]  ventilators, ventilators, as the murderous governor of New York said, he will be intubated
[01:12.560 --> 01:17.560]  and murdered. The new guillotine is that plan. Documents came out years ago that they would use.
[01:17.560 --> 01:23.880]  This is the cover for martial law. You now see it around the world. Well, it's coming here,
[01:23.880 --> 01:30.120]  I told you, and the Democrats in California and in Michigan and in New York and other states have
[01:30.120 --> 01:37.840]  announced the Clinton Global Initiative with Google is tracking and tracing everything you say.
[01:37.840 --> 01:44.000]  They're reading your emails, your text messages, and if you tell someone via text message or email
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.760]  you have COVID, they're going to first have a lot of high-profile cases like the guy that
[01:48.760 --> 01:53.800]  sneezed on the elevator. They had a national manhunt like he was a child molester or something like
[01:53.800 --> 01:58.160]  them, and they showed that in Australia to get that image of this is the ultimate crime and
[01:58.160 --> 02:03.640]  helicopters and police dogs. They're then going to come for you and they're building giant centers
[02:03.640 --> 02:09.400]  everywhere. The CDC announced it last year. This is their permanent martial law. It doesn't matter
[02:09.400 --> 02:18.760]  if Texas and other schools, they have 2,000 students at one school, 600 are out sick. Waco
[02:18.760 --> 02:23.920]  school, one school alone, teachers in their 40s, totally healthy, dead from being intubated. They
[02:23.920 --> 02:29.160]  didn't give them ivermectin. They didn't give them steroids. It's the vaccinated that are sloughing
[02:29.160 --> 02:34.840]  it and causing it, and so last year was an overblown hoax. This year is completely real as the
[02:34.840 --> 02:40.520]  scientists predicted here. They're spreading it, and it's an impossible enemy to ever beat. They've
[02:40.520 --> 02:48.760]  released synthetic viruses, prion crystals that cause cancer and so much more. They're not just
[02:48.760 --> 02:53.720]  like a carcinogen. They go in and grow cancer in your body, and they just admit it in the news. Oh,
[02:53.720 --> 02:59.240]  yeah. The shot gives you cancer. No big deal. You'll get stage 4 and die. Just in the news. Yeah,
[02:59.240 --> 03:05.240]  your uterus will be cut out. You'll get lymphatic cancer. No big deal. No big deal. Just in the
[03:05.240 --> 03:10.280]  news. No big deal. And just the U.N.s coming to take you out of your house. No big deal. And so
[03:10.280 --> 03:14.120]  they did it. They killed us. It's here. They're going to blame the unvaccinated for all the mass
[03:14.120 --> 03:19.400]  death now happening. We already have more deaths happening today than we had last winter, supposedly
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.720]  during the peak of this crap. They were really counting everybody else dying of the flu or heart
[03:23.720 --> 03:30.040]  attacks or cancer. Now there are people really dying, and they're calling it, oh, polio-like disease.
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.960]  Oh, this other viral thing. Oh, this other deal. And it's prions. Because people get over it,
[03:35.960 --> 03:39.640]  and they get sick again and again and again, because it's crystals. It's mad cow disease,
[03:40.440 --> 03:46.920]  aerosolized. People are now factories of it. Unbelievable. And it was in all the studies.
[03:46.920 --> 03:51.240]  They knew what they did. They killed us. They killed everybody. Most of us are walking dead now.
[03:52.200 --> 03:56.440]  There's ways to mitigate it. I've remitted it, folks. So our enemies are battling to keep that
[03:56.440 --> 04:02.200]  from getting out because their job is depopulated. Here's Dr. Ryan, the U.N. Rapid Reaction Force.
[04:02.200 --> 04:05.640]  When we come back, it's now, I'll show you the announcements, the health department letters
[04:05.640 --> 04:10.920]  going out, that if your child was near a contact tracer, there's no proof they even have COVID.
[04:10.920 --> 04:15.800]  They're coming to put them in a FEMA camp. Here he is. And at the moment, in most parts of the
[04:15.800 --> 04:21.480]  world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now
[04:21.480 --> 04:27.160]  is happening in the household, at family level. In some senses, transmission has been taken off
[04:27.160 --> 04:35.160]  the streets and pushed back into family units. Now we need to go and look in families to find
[04:35.160 --> 04:41.000]  those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.640]  Oh, just like when they keep babies alive and harvest their organs and safe and dignified,
[04:45.640 --> 04:49.640]  when you hear that, they want camps, they want your children. And now they've specifically
[04:49.640 --> 04:57.320]  announced they're coming for your children. They want total power. They always want child
[04:57.320 --> 05:04.200]  sacrifice at the end, pedophile armies. In these insane times, I wouldn't mess around.
[05:04.200 --> 05:09.320]  I wouldn't screw around with your health and your immune system. I would do everything you can to
[05:09.320 --> 05:14.360]  boost your body's natural defenses. And at the same time, support those that are fighting the

[06:10.840 --> 06:27.480]  disinformation. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:27.480 --> 06:33.640]  It's Wednesday, September 1 2021. Democrats across the country and help departments they
[06:33.640 --> 06:38.920]  control have announced the Clinton funded and controlled contact tracers are coming to your
[06:38.920 --> 06:46.280]  house to forcibly test you and then quote take your children to a facility where they will be
[06:46.280 --> 06:51.960]  safe even if you test negative. Remember what they announced about the quote shield centers
[06:51.960 --> 06:57.400]  to protect quote those who don't have COVID yet. They want mass prisons everywhere,
[06:57.400 --> 07:02.680]  dragging people away paramilitary dressed in medical outfits to give them the shield and
[07:02.680 --> 07:06.760]  the cover story for martial law. It's been announced by the UN but announced by the CDC.
[07:06.760 --> 07:12.440]  It is happening absolutely everywhere. So what you just saw last week in Australia or the UK
[07:12.440 --> 07:17.960]  with police dogs ripping men's faces off showing their nose ripped off and the police celebrating
[07:17.960 --> 07:23.160]  police horses riding women down putting them in comas water cannons blasting people's eyes out
[07:23.720 --> 07:29.000]  locked in your homes for years. Total hell now being announced here is the headline for the
[07:29.000 --> 07:36.440]  broadcast today breaking Michigan announces plan to forcibly take children from parents
[07:36.440 --> 07:42.520]  for the mere possibility of contact with COVID carriers. This is all happening. The plan has
[07:42.520 --> 07:47.880]  always been to give you and controlled contact tracers total martial law power over every nation
[07:47.880 --> 07:52.760]  individual on earth big tech will have the power. The images from around the world of medical SWAT
[07:52.760 --> 07:59.160]  teams dragging crying children from their homes is now coming to America. But the house of medical
[07:59.160 --> 08:07.960]  tyranny cards is coming down. Both of the top FDA vaccine experts have resigned citing the dangerous
[08:07.960 --> 08:14.600]  political move by the White House to push the deadly Franken shots on children and quote COVID boosters.
[08:16.120 --> 08:20.840]  Here's what's happening in Australia now as the little girl is drug away from her father
[08:20.840 --> 08:27.560]  who has been savagely beaten in the face by police and she is drug away and forcibly inoculated
[08:27.560 --> 08:49.240]  at age 12. Here is the savage murderous evil radio listeners don't see this little girl's crying
[08:49.240 --> 08:53.800]  boom they punch him in the face slam name on the head and drag her away with pleasure.
[08:53.800 --> 09:01.720]  Now the sterilization can begin. She instinctively fights for her life. The soft kill will be
[09:01.720 --> 09:08.440]  delivered because they're the liberals. They're the good people need to get the children that
[09:08.440 --> 09:16.200]  make it out of the womb and plant them with the cancer viruses. Now let's go back to the
[09:16.200 --> 09:22.120]  director of the United Nations global rapid reaction force and notice the CDC says it's under
[09:22.120 --> 09:28.760]  UN control and they say they're over the housing they're over guns they're over your families.
[09:29.560 --> 09:32.680]  You ever wondered how the UN would take over they're in control of big tech the media
[09:33.240 --> 09:38.360]  and the holy grail is taking children out of your houses already happening around the world.
[09:38.360 --> 09:43.720]  Here's what he had to say 17 months ago and now it's happening in the United States. I'll go to
[09:43.720 --> 09:49.640]  that next. Here it is. And at the moment in most parts of the world due to lockdown most of the
[09:49.640 --> 09:54.760]  transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household at
[09:54.760 --> 10:00.440]  family level. In some senses transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into
[10:00.440 --> 10:07.640]  family units. Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick
[10:07.640 --> 10:14.200]  and remove them and isolate them in a in a safe and dignified manner. Now let's be clear they
[10:14.200 --> 10:21.240]  released a five virus cancer delivery hiv delivery system chimera that is the Nobel Prize winner
[10:21.240 --> 10:31.800]  for the discovery of hiv and isolation of the virus 1984. That was not very contagious as they
[10:31.800 --> 10:36.760]  claimed it was but if you did get it and didn't have vitamin d or zinc and get into your cells
[10:36.760 --> 10:41.560]  and kill you it was very deadly if it could infect you kind of like a red on yellow kills a fella
[10:41.560 --> 10:46.360]  coral snake in the cobra family that lives where I live in Texas and then we call it red on yellow
[10:46.360 --> 10:50.520]  kills a fella because it's there's another snake that's similar but it's different you know the
[10:50.520 --> 10:54.280]  stripes are different but you always know red on yellow kills a fella but you've got to let it
[10:54.280 --> 10:59.960]  gnaw on you for a while you it takes about 10 15 seconds a little bitty tiny fangs but it is a
[10:59.960 --> 11:04.920]  cobra it's in the cobra family it's a sea snake that lives on land and if it gets its venom into
[11:04.920 --> 11:12.440]  you you'll be dead in about 15 minutes same thing with cova didn't have big fangs this new thing is
[11:12.440 --> 11:21.880]  a king cobra with three inch fangs but what it injects you with is not as deadly but still extremely
[11:21.880 --> 11:27.640]  dangerous but it infects way more people I mean you could just be in a room with somebody that
[11:27.640 --> 11:33.400]  is sloughing and shedding these things and you will get it doesn't matter how much vitamins or
[11:33.400 --> 11:36.440]  vitamins or minerals you've got you're still going to get it now the difference is you'll be sick
[11:36.440 --> 11:40.360]  for a day instead of dying that's what all the numbers the statistics show and if you don't
[11:40.360 --> 11:45.960]  ivermectin it turns your immune system on at the right level and just like incredible and that's
[11:45.960 --> 11:50.920]  why they're battling to stop that and battling to stop medical doctors from learning about it and
[11:50.920 --> 11:55.960]  battling to learn the japanese government came out and said 100 works early stages battling
[11:55.960 --> 12:00.600]  to make sure you die just part of their criminal vicious assault on you and your family
[12:00.600 --> 12:09.000]  so next segment i'm going to get into this big big big article i've got the press releases i've
[12:09.000 --> 12:17.480]  got the local news this is getting no attention this is nbc news 25 michigan lawmaker calls for
[12:17.480 --> 12:23.160]  firing of county health director and of course they never get what's going on this is directed by
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.400]  the un i've got it all over the country happening just announced this week
[12:27.400 --> 12:32.600]  they're building the emergency centers they're saying they're going to go in and find the
[12:32.600 --> 12:36.280]  people with the contact tracers and take you to the facility and remember it's just rampant
[12:37.880 --> 12:45.240]  one school where one of my crew has family in east texas has 2000 students 600 are out sick
[12:45.240 --> 12:49.560]  with covid and feel like gorillas are sitting on their chest teachers are dying in that school
[12:49.560 --> 12:55.720]  i was just randomly reading about weiko and saw where one school in weiko uh one black lady 40
[12:55.720 --> 12:58.840]  something years old one hispanic guy 40 something years old both in good health
[12:59.480 --> 13:05.240]  dead from covid because they were sent and intubated by the way both vaccinated it said oh very
[13:05.240 --> 13:09.720]  strange they both had their shots of course they did and i've got all the statistics coming up at
[13:09.720 --> 13:16.120]  the bottom of the hour israel the list goes on and on highest death rates spike directly in the
[13:16.120 --> 13:20.760]  two weeks after they do national shots because the israelis line up and do it they're like 90
[13:20.760 --> 13:25.880]  percent injected only the hecetic jews are saying no because they're smart and
[13:28.680 --> 13:31.640]  literally they have the highest death rate in the world they're the most vaccinated and i've
[13:31.640 --> 13:38.120]  got other countries i'll show you the graphs from their government ladies and gentlemen
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.360]  but first i have the actual letters being sent out saying we're coming to take your children
[13:44.360 --> 13:49.880]  to put them in a center if the contact tracing computers at the school say they came in contact
[13:49.880 --> 13:54.360]  with someone that may have it so it's in the school your kid gets it they don't say take ivermectin
[13:54.360 --> 13:58.440]  and take antibiotics so you don't get a secondary infection they don't tell you take the oral
[13:58.440 --> 14:03.400]  steroids that work just boom amazingly no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[14:32.600 --> 14:36.040]  off the cuff mistake i'm gonna remind you about it because that's what we do in the next days
[14:36.040 --> 14:41.320]  i just said probably it's a revolving door they want to get paid off for their evil right away
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.400]  the two top vaccine heads at the FDA we haven't been hearing from it's all been the cdc in the
[14:45.400 --> 14:51.720]  white house they came out and said this is evil children don't need the shot we said they don't
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.360]  and the booster is pointless it'll make people sicker that's why we resigned and they're getting
[14:56.360 --> 15:04.360]  ready to go public yeah whoa that's badass that is just devastating to these murdering scum
[15:04.360 --> 15:09.320]  when the left tells you oh it's as good as pumpkin pie on thanksgiving oh it's as good as

[15:21.960 --> 15:26.840]  evil as hell say that so we shouldn't do this because they know what they're doing and they
[15:26.840 --> 15:33.400]  don't want to be going to nuremberg too oh you talk about rats leaving the sinking ship man
[15:33.400 --> 15:42.520]  oh yeah baby yeah there is a god and it's going to be the whistleblowers they're going to bring

[18:24.440 --> 18:29.320]  it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the
[18:29.320 --> 18:33.960]  show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information
[18:33.960 --> 18:38.360]  warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally prepared and
[18:38.360 --> 18:41.880]  one of the number one things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food
[18:41.880 --> 18:47.160]  ready to ship at very affordable prices at info or store dot com so whether it's a month or a six
[18:47.160 --> 18:52.760]  month or a year supply or specialty diets it's ready to ship right now lock your orders in before
[18:52.760 --> 18:58.040]  food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits because believe me serious times are
[18:58.040 --> 19:04.680]  coming get ready at info or store dot com it is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated
[19:04.680 --> 19:10.200]  and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see through this illusion is with
[19:10.200 --> 19:16.600]  our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride
[19:16.600 --> 19:21.800]  forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[19:21.800 --> 19:26.680]  natural functions which have been known for millennia the hindu chakras aligned with the
[19:26.680 --> 19:32.520]  endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described as
[19:32.520 --> 19:38.040]  the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[19:38.040 --> 19:44.200]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential to keeping
[19:44.200 --> 19:50.520]  our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your
[19:50.520 --> 19:56.040]  drinking water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal get them both
[19:56.040 --> 20:11.960]  today for yourself or a friend at info war store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:11.960 --> 20:30.520]  you are listening to an infowars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[20:30.520 --> 20:36.440]  you are the resistance all right let me use this cheesy star wars analogy because everybody
[20:36.440 --> 20:42.200]  seems to get those the death star getting blown up in episode four this is about as big as that
[20:44.920 --> 20:51.240]  two years ago in december of 2019 they had an emergency meeting in switzerland
[20:53.160 --> 20:58.360]  and they had the head of the un vaccine program there and she said quote the front lines wobbly
[20:58.360 --> 21:01.800]  the vaccines aren't working they're killing people our own doctors around the world are
[21:01.800 --> 21:05.800]  refusing them and saying that they're full of cancer viruses and contaminated we don't know
[21:05.800 --> 21:10.280]  we're not allowed to test them we're just giving them by our partners like bill ommel indicates
[21:10.280 --> 21:14.600]  the imf and the world bank these are all quotes we pulled it down to like 15 minute reports and
[21:14.600 --> 21:20.200]  played it here they had an eight minute report the 50 minute report that was a huge event but it
[21:20.200 --> 21:24.440]  didn't get any attention and i said if this gets attention it's like the death star blowing up
[21:25.080 --> 21:28.040]  and i said i don't know how they're going to cover this up well they'd already released
[21:28.040 --> 21:32.040]  covid and we're going to use that big crisis to pose as savers and hope we forgot about the
[21:32.040 --> 21:37.480]  gulf war illness from the shots and all the autistic kids and all the cancers and sv 40 and
[21:37.480 --> 21:42.680]  the rest of it they created even bigger disaster to cover that up which i said i said look for
[21:42.680 --> 21:45.720]  something big i don't know how they're going to get out of this i said they'll probably release
[21:45.720 --> 21:50.520]  a bio weapon and pose the savers i mean and they did that it's in their damn white paper so i
[21:50.520 --> 21:53.880]  didn't predict that it's there i just i said okay that's in the playbook i think they're
[21:53.880 --> 21:59.160]  going to run this play i'm not a top nfl coach but watching the globalist i'm a top guy no one
[21:59.160 --> 22:03.160]  they're going to play most of the time i know what's going to come out of the gates but before
[22:03.160 --> 22:07.160]  they probably even pick what they're going to do because all i do is watch these murdering scum
[22:07.160 --> 22:12.360]  i know them well i've read their books i watched their events and they are just murderous trash i
[22:12.360 --> 22:20.200]  mean hitler did not even have a shine a candle to these guys okay i mean they want your ass dead
[22:20.200 --> 22:25.080]  they have just a greed and a hatred it's like in there will be blood where you got the oil guy
[22:25.080 --> 22:30.120]  he goes i just hate people and i just want to kill people and i i just want everybody to fail
[22:30.120 --> 22:34.280]  that's supposed to be john d rockefeller the first because that's what he was like he goes i just
[22:34.280 --> 22:40.280]  want to kill people i just hate everybody i hate my children i hate my wife i just want to kill
[22:40.280 --> 22:49.320]  everybody there's a competition in me where i don't like other people see i love everybody
[22:49.320 --> 22:55.800]  i'm an alpha male that's aggressive they're alpha males that want to kill you they're wolves
[22:56.920 --> 23:03.080]  and people better get wise to it but they are floundering they don't even know what to do
[23:03.960 --> 23:09.240]  most of liberty movement since this broke 20 hours ago 24 hours ago don't even know how to respond
[23:09.240 --> 23:17.080]  to this and they're spinning it oh they disagreed on boosters no if you hear what they said which
[23:17.080 --> 23:26.760]  was extremely limited the two top neurologists that run the vaccine program at the FDA said
[23:26.760 --> 23:31.800]  three things but but but two on why they're specifically mad on policy but the big reason
[23:32.520 --> 23:41.960]  why there's three things is they said we're not running anything the cdc and the national
[23:41.960 --> 23:48.040]  institutes of allergies run by fauci is controlled by the un and they call all the shots we're the
[23:48.040 --> 23:53.400]  federal agency under law that's supposed to do this not the cdc why is the cdc saying they control
[23:53.400 --> 23:57.240]  all the rents in america and all the rental properties why are they saying they control your
[23:57.240 --> 24:06.280]  guns they don't it's a u in power grab through a captured federal agency comprenday congress
[24:06.280 --> 24:13.320]  comprenday senator paul come pre i mean the damn bureaucrats get what's going on you know i like
[24:13.320 --> 24:16.680]  trump he's a good guy because i knew how naive he was actually i knew he was really he was really
[24:16.680 --> 24:23.240]  trying i told him i said sir the cia has this project two billion dollars running media operations
[24:23.240 --> 24:29.400]  against you when he was president elect i said here's the program here's the zero hedge article
[24:29.400 --> 24:35.880]  obama just signed this into law two billion dollars to pay the media and run disinfo against you you
[24:35.880 --> 24:41.160]  need to rescind that that's when they literally started threatening to kill me and and member
[24:41.160 --> 24:44.680]  freaked out about alex jones because they're all listening to his phone calls they now admit and
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.960]  i'm telling him that obama left stay behind networks and if you don't know what a stay
[24:49.960 --> 24:55.720]  behind network is folks trump called him you know embeds they you know they they uh they had
[24:55.720 --> 25:01.640]  molds yeah stay behind networks but i'm digressing i'm sorry uh this is so huge
[25:01.640 --> 25:09.080]  huge you don't hear a word out of congress maybe ran paul and maybe senator cruiser actually evil
[25:09.960 --> 25:13.880]  because i think they're smart men they know all this maybe josh holly's really evil
[25:13.880 --> 25:17.560]  they all know how this is all run they know about the stay behind networks they know about the
[25:17.560 --> 25:23.800]  permanent bureaucracies they know the cdc's been getting you in orders just on face value
[25:23.800 --> 25:31.720]  stop that right now stop it so excuse me i'm really excited right now you have the two head
[25:31.720 --> 25:36.920]  bureaucrats scientists over vaccines for decades quote giants in their field i'll read the quotes
[25:38.040 --> 25:45.560]  leaving and saying we don't run our agency the cdc doesh and it's an advisory group
[25:45.560 --> 25:51.720]  we are a cabinet level group so that's like a college football team telling the nfl champions
[25:51.720 --> 25:59.880]  what to do in bureaucratic sense okay it's like a college team telling the nfl commission what to do
[25:59.880 --> 26:07.320]  forget the teams okay and and again that's the un controlling that and you see the power grab and
[26:07.320 --> 26:11.560]  they're like what are they doing over rents what are they doing over guns what what the hell's
[26:11.560 --> 26:16.600]  going on here and by the way children don't need this even if the vaccine was clean which it's not
[26:16.600 --> 26:22.760]  so they come out and they say this agency's out of control taking over the white house isn't a doctor
[26:22.760 --> 26:27.400]  the president is the doctor he's wrong we don't need to give children these shots they finally found
[26:27.400 --> 26:33.640]  their morals fine let's use another cheesy star wars analogy like Darth Vader throwing the emperor
[26:33.640 --> 26:37.400]  down the shaft i mean you got to choose at a certain point whether you're going to go along
[26:37.400 --> 26:43.080]  with this or not because this is damn evil folks and finally these people found their souls and said
[26:43.080 --> 26:49.080]  we do not need to give this to children this agency is out of control and is taking over our agency
[26:49.080 --> 26:55.080]  and the booster shots are not needed yeah not needed like another hole in the head already
[26:55.080 --> 26:59.960]  shots your ass twice yeah another bullet's not needed fired right through your damn heart that's
[26:59.960 --> 27:05.720]  what they're doing so and i mean that as an allegory not literally as an analogy so so so so
[27:05.720 --> 27:14.280]  here we are folks this is so huge this is so massive there it is breaking up the eight leaders quit
[27:15.160 --> 27:19.800]  after democrats pressure to approve booster shots and vaccines for children but you won't
[27:19.800 --> 27:23.320]  hear the young turds and you won't hear rachel maddoe they all get their talking points they're
[27:23.320 --> 27:29.160]  all paid they will ignore all this and glaze over all this but this is the holy grail for people
[27:29.160 --> 27:33.160]  that go oh alex jones isn't a doctor i don't want to listen to him no i've just interviewed hundreds
[27:33.160 --> 27:38.360]  of them and all i do is read the literature and the history okay well what about the two
[27:38.360 --> 27:46.200]  is head virologist at the sea at the fda saying the cbc is captured by the un what about the two
[27:46.200 --> 27:51.480]  head virologist at the fda coming on it's saying children do not need these injections and we do
[27:51.480 --> 27:59.080]  not need more shots this is asinine to just continue over and over and over again to do this at what
[27:59.080 --> 28:03.960]  point will we come up for air at what point will we stop submitting to this madness at what point
[28:03.960 --> 28:09.720]  will we stop clout swab and and and tridot on tv saying you're gonna own nothing we're gonna have
[28:09.720 --> 28:15.240]  climate lockdowns and we're gonna put you on a universal income and control everything and and
[28:15.240 --> 28:20.920]  then they look like maniacs and you've got the australian health minister going there's gonna
[28:20.920 --> 28:26.760]  be shots every couple months you i just get used to it my little pretty i mean she she freaking

[32:08.440 --> 32:14.760]  from brazil to south africa understand we're under a great reset the un globalist attack
[32:15.720 --> 32:22.360]  but none of our leaders other than balsamaro had trumped a little bit seem to understand that
[32:23.000 --> 32:29.000]  and so no one is addressing the fact that this is a 21st century corporate economic war on the
[32:29.000 --> 32:34.680]  general population and the conversion of the planet into a high-tech technocracy with a global
[32:34.680 --> 32:42.760]  ip global medical system global medical control i d and of course a carbon taxes that tied to that
[32:42.760 --> 32:47.480]  the fracture every movement this is their takeover they admitted it they've said it
[32:48.040 --> 32:52.280]  to know the prime minister canada's on tv yesterday saying this is an environmental
[32:52.280 --> 32:57.640]  takeover plan and the whole lockdowns of just talking to prepare for climate lockdowns so they're
[32:57.640 --> 33:00.600]  announcing their takeover we've got a resistance they know
[33:00.600 --> 33:26.440]  oh you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:26.440 --> 33:30.840]  such beautiful poetry
[33:35.720 --> 33:39.640]  see the stars and beyond beyond the stars
[33:39.640 --> 33:42.040]  on the gates
[33:55.800 --> 34:00.280]  hard to turn that off huh good stuff
[34:02.040 --> 34:07.880]  care how real that language is all right let's get into it right now as the globalist
[34:07.880 --> 34:13.080]  declare war on humanity and as we begin to rediscover who we are they now have fear in their
[34:13.080 --> 34:17.480]  eyes that's why they're trying to dominate us and control us but they will fall like all
[34:17.480 --> 34:23.640]  tyrants in history do question is how great will the cost be before we come to the realization
[34:23.640 --> 34:28.200]  this is the un world government takeover to respond to the bio weapon they released and
[34:28.200 --> 34:33.720]  now the vaccine that turns us into bio weapon factories and all of the evidence that absolutely
[34:33.720 --> 34:41.160]  proves it so let me calm down and be a good boy and then i've got a rule because we got 20 phone
[34:41.160 --> 34:47.800]  lines if we leave five six seven eight people on hold at the end of the shows we have time to get
[34:47.800 --> 34:51.800]  to them we'll take your number if you wanted to call you back put you on the next day so we're
[34:51.800 --> 34:55.560]  about to call back six or seven people who are still on the line i'm going to try to race through
[34:55.560 --> 34:59.960]  them and then we're going to open the phones up for everybody to respond to this FDA knows
[34:59.960 --> 35:06.840]  i think i'd love to hear from nurses and doctors and others out there to give us your take on this
[35:07.560 --> 35:11.720]  situation and i'll give that number out next segment but i want to give our call
[35:12.600 --> 35:16.600]  operators and their chance to call back to folks that were left on hold yesterday
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.640]  because most places have like five six seven phone lines we have 20 we actually have a thousand
[35:21.640 --> 35:27.960]  phone lines it's digital but we leave 20 on the board we've gotten what's our record 27
[35:27.960 --> 35:32.840]  thousand phone calls in one show before the 27 thousand phone calls we got a computer in there
[35:32.840 --> 35:38.120]  it tells us that's uh you know even national talk shows like beg for callers like please call in
[35:38.120 --> 35:44.440]  you know we're only on 100 stations it's about popularity uh our records 27 000 different people
[35:44.440 --> 35:49.320]  called us uh on a uh four hour show one day thousands always call in so that's why it's so
[35:49.320 --> 35:54.840]  hard for folks to get in but we do want to hear from you and it shows the popularity of liberty
[35:54.840 --> 36:01.400]  so i'll give the number out next segment we have a special guest joining us in the third hour i'll
[36:01.400 --> 36:07.480]  tell you about that when that comes up he had a viral video over six million views they removed
[36:07.480 --> 36:11.400]  it so i thought you might want to see the viral video and hear from the man himself that took action
[36:12.200 --> 36:17.000]  but let me just do this let me just be calm and read these headlines how about we do that
[36:18.280 --> 36:23.720]  this is out of zero hedge two senior fda officials stepping down over reported disagreements
[36:23.720 --> 36:28.760]  with the white house of their booster shots and inoculation of children and the fact that the
[36:28.760 --> 36:33.560]  white house is under the control of the united nations that's out of bloomberg that's out of
[36:33.560 --> 36:38.520]  endpoint news you can go read it all for yourself it's up on info wars dot com uh two senior fda
[36:38.520 --> 36:44.040]  vaccine leaders stepped down as agency faces decision on boosters they go into what a giant
[36:44.040 --> 36:51.560]  below it is that the two top virologists that they call mountains in their time well let's read it
[36:51.560 --> 36:58.840]  it in a major bloat of vaccine efforts senior fda leaders stepping down two of the fda's most
[36:58.840 --> 37:03.400]  senior vaccine leaders are exiting from their positions raising fresh questions about the
[37:03.400 --> 37:10.760]  bide administration and the way it's sidelined the fda that's statutorily in charge maryon gruber
[37:10.760 --> 37:15.880]  director of the fda's office of vaccine research and review you know that's who does it a 32 year
[37:15.880 --> 37:20.520]  veteran of the agency will leave at the end of october all the crimes before i guess we're okay
[37:20.520 --> 37:24.280]  but this is just too big yeah exactly did they figure out they're not going to get away with it
[37:24.280 --> 37:31.800]  or finally found their soul and ovar deputy director phil cross who's been at the fda for
[37:31.800 --> 37:37.640]  more than a decade will leave in november the news first reported by bio century is a massive blow
[37:37.640 --> 37:45.480]  to confidence in the agency's ability to regulate vaccines uh it's a massive blow that the white
[37:45.480 --> 37:50.680]  house is under un control targeting children with dangerous dangerous experimental vaccines that did
[37:50.680 --> 37:57.880]  not get fda approval that's why the fda heads are quitting if they did not get fda approval they
[37:57.880 --> 38:03.480]  are not fda approved the fda said we've extended the emergency authorization but then they call
[38:03.480 --> 38:09.400]  the head of the agency who approved oxy cotton and fentanyl the monster woman who's been brought back
[38:09.400 --> 38:15.400]  monster woman said well we'll just say it's approved when it's not that's why they're leaving
[38:16.760 --> 38:21.160]  i mean folks the globalists are committing crimes that are so huge i shudder to think
[38:22.440 --> 38:26.520]  what the bigger crime is that's coming they think it's going to cover this up i mean this is i mean
[38:26.520 --> 38:28.920]  folks this is like a nuclear war it's just done through shots
[38:28.920 --> 38:41.640]  the bombshell announcement comes as a particularly cruel moment crucial moment
[38:41.640 --> 38:46.680]  as boosters and children's shots are being weighed by the regulator the departure also
[38:46.680 --> 38:51.800]  come as the administration has recently jumped ahead of the fda's reviews of booster shots
[38:51.800 --> 38:57.240]  announcing that they might be available in the week of september so the fda saying hey we don't
[38:57.240 --> 39:01.720]  think this is needed hey this causes a problem hey this children certainly don't need to take it
[39:01.720 --> 39:07.320]  they just go oh we just say you say it's approved well we didn't say that we don't care your boss
[39:07.320 --> 39:13.080]  approved fentanyl yeah the chinese got that from us mit developed fentanyl 50 to 100 times
[39:13.080 --> 39:19.800]  stronger than heroin depending on the way you make it a former senior fda leader told end point
[39:19.800 --> 39:26.600]  that they are departing because they are frustrated that the cdc and the acip committee
[39:26.600 --> 39:33.080]  are involved in decisions that they think should be up to the fda the former fda are also said
[39:33.720 --> 39:40.920]  is that they are upset that the cber director peter marx is not insisting that those decisions
[39:40.920 --> 39:46.200]  be kept inside the fda what finally did it for them was the white house getting ahead of the fda on
[39:46.200 --> 39:55.160]  booster shots fdh former acting chief scientist lucenia marino added on twitter the fda is losing
[39:55.160 --> 40:00.680]  two giants who helped bring us many safe and effective vaccines over the decades of public
[40:00.680 --> 40:07.240]  service yeah right and it just goes on from there so there you have it let me give you some more
[40:07.240 --> 40:12.360]  bomb shells move that little document you have shot up here a little bit higher thank you look
[40:12.360 --> 40:19.480]  at this this is out of the american journal red cross says vaccine takers can't donate plasma
[40:19.480 --> 40:25.080]  to covid patients in japan just totally banned the moderna shot because all over the country
[40:25.080 --> 40:31.960]  they found liquid metal in it and it was killing people magnetic liquid metal yeah think they
[40:31.960 --> 40:38.440]  launched an attack on us think it's a little bit of a takeover yeah it's far worse than we even know
[40:39.080 --> 40:43.400]  i mean ladies and gentlemen there are people that were injected vaccinated with this stuff
[40:43.400 --> 40:51.320]  that are dropping dead everywhere just like we had that whistleblower phd an educator on from
[40:51.320 --> 40:58.120]  ohio who went super viral last week and he looked at him he said you understand from all the studies
[40:58.920 --> 41:02.840]  that they did in animals that this is going to kill a large portion of those the next few
[41:02.840 --> 41:09.080]  years that took it you understand your schools will all close you will all get sick and now
[41:09.080 --> 41:14.040]  schools are closing everywhere because the majority of teachers have got bloody rashes and blood coming

[46:20.120 --> 46:26.760]  balsamaro and just a few others are addressing it for what it is to their people a foreign
[46:26.760 --> 46:34.440]  anti-human anti-family anti-god takeover of the very biological system of humans this is a corporate
[46:34.440 --> 46:39.560]  takeover of our bodies of ourselves with the world ID the medical tracking system that will be
[46:39.560 --> 46:46.120]  tied to the carbon taxes it's all been announced it is a dystopic nightmare and humanity is starting
[46:46.120 --> 46:51.560]  to organize but our leaders aren't we need senator paul and senator holly and others that have shown
[46:51.560 --> 46:57.240]  some understanding of this and senator cruz to organize against this foreign multinational
[46:57.240 --> 47:01.640]  corporate takeover through big pharma big banks and big tech or we have no hope
[47:01.640 --> 47:09.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:09.320 --> 47:13.000]  you
[47:21.640 --> 47:32.600]  live from austin texas fighting back if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[47:32.600 --> 47:38.840]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[47:39.560 --> 47:50.360]  wednesday september 1st 2021 8777892539877789 alex i want to hear from callers their situations
[47:50.360 --> 47:55.400]  with covid their situations with inoculations their family they don't want your voice heard
[47:55.400 --> 47:59.000]  they want to smother you they want to silence you while they quietly kill you and then suck all
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.560]  your money this is a takeover by psychotics in big tech with big banks and big pharma
[48:05.560 --> 48:11.800]  and much of the medical system they have taken over 8777892539 but they've bitten off way more
[48:12.600 --> 48:21.800]  than they can shoot so i've got so many graphs and so much proof that it's just unbelievable
[48:21.800 --> 48:26.040]  that i'll hit next hour out of israel and other countries that right when they take
[48:26.040 --> 48:30.760]  the first shot mass death they call it covered right when they take the second shot mass death
[48:30.760 --> 48:35.880]  they call it covered and now the booster shot mass death they call it covered and they've done
[48:35.880 --> 48:41.480]  studies mathematicians have a statisticians i've got the articles right here where it corresponds
[48:41.480 --> 48:46.840]  to the number of people injected is it corresponds to how high the death rate is
[48:46.840 --> 48:56.600]  is it is real and in Greece both two very authoritarian globalist controlled societies
[48:58.520 --> 49:01.560]  and it's the same graph you can basically put the graphs over each other
[49:01.560 --> 49:07.640]  unbelievable i mean i knew this was all coming i knew it was in operation lock step i knew it
[49:07.640 --> 49:10.600]  was in all their plans but man we're living this
[49:10.600 --> 49:17.800]  gosh i've talked to probably five people in person yeah in the last two weeks
[49:18.760 --> 49:24.680]  who have friends and family that went blind after they took the Pfizer and Moderna shots
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.840]  it just forms blood clots right on the optic nerve and inside the eye
[49:33.320 --> 49:37.720]  wow and then i've got studies saying it does it
[49:37.720 --> 49:42.920]  and all these mass heart attacks in young people all over the world who take the shot i mean this
[49:43.480 --> 49:48.440]  is incredible and then you've got all the bureaucrats and the lawyers and the leftists
[49:48.440 --> 49:53.720]  and the media being paid off acting like we're the bad guys acting like we're the criminals
[49:59.320 --> 50:04.600]  but let me hit this first okay i'm gonna go over all that after i take calls
[50:04.600 --> 50:09.640]  but look at this this is so huge
[50:12.120 --> 50:17.240]  and it's again the name of the show today that hope you share is breaking michigan announces plan
[50:19.480 --> 50:24.040]  to forcibly take children from parents for possible contact with covid carriers now remember
[50:24.040 --> 50:31.960]  what i covered three weeks ago the cdc shield plan from last year and their designating centers
[50:31.960 --> 50:38.680]  sports stadiums all over the country and other facilities to quote take at-risk groups
[50:40.280 --> 50:44.840]  who may have been in contact with a covid person to protect them and put the children
[50:44.840 --> 50:47.960]  in one area the women in another a man in the other and they even have forced labor
[50:49.880 --> 50:53.480]  and there it is interim operational considerations implementing the shielding approach
[50:54.040 --> 50:59.400]  to prevent covid-19 infections in humanitarian settings and the uk europe and australia new
[50:59.400 --> 51:04.280]  zealand have all built the camps and are now doing it saying it's not just if you fly back to australia
[51:04.280 --> 51:11.320]  or the uk we put you in there for two weeks at a quarantine jail cell now we're going to come out
[51:11.320 --> 51:14.920]  and check if we think you were near somebody even if you don't have it we're going to take you away
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.640]  and hold you even if your test is negative i mean it's just the total power total control
[51:21.480 --> 51:24.440]  the queensland regional quarantine facility a well camp
[51:24.440 --> 51:29.000]  camp and they say get used to shots all the time
[51:31.480 --> 51:35.800]  so when we i wrote this headline this morning it should be democrats across the country announce
[51:35.800 --> 51:40.200]  plan but it's michigan specifically because california new york have said similar things
[51:40.200 --> 51:46.600]  we've got that but look at this michigan lawmaker calls for firing of county health director
[51:46.600 --> 51:54.360]  algin county health director but it's all over the state since this article came out we found a
[51:54.360 --> 51:59.720]  bunch of them around the state and what does it say michigan state rep steve johnson we should get
[51:59.720 --> 52:05.240]  him on posted a picture on his facebook page now everybody else is doing it which appears to be
[52:05.240 --> 52:11.800]  a letter from the county health department to a patient or guardian the letter discusses covid-19
[52:11.800 --> 52:16.600]  protocols regarding a child who has come in close contact to a covet nineteen individual
[52:16.600 --> 52:21.080]  and has determined the person is to be a carrier of the covet so it's all just computers and big
[52:21.080 --> 52:24.840]  tech and the clinton foundation that run this along with soros and gates they're all bought into
[52:24.840 --> 52:30.120]  these groups they get billions per state of money to then run this crap the letter also says you are
[52:30.120 --> 52:36.760]  hereby notified you're required to cooperate with the county health department in an effort to prevent
[52:36.760 --> 52:40.840]  or control the transmission of this serious disease or illness which they put in us through the
[52:40.840 --> 52:47.800]  vaccines at one point the letter states if you fail to take the actions prescribed in this warning
[52:47.800 --> 52:53.400]  notice the county health department shall petition the court to see in order to compel
[52:53.400 --> 52:58.840]  your compliance which may result with you being taken into protective custody to protect the public
[52:58.840 --> 53:04.760]  as well and then goes on to say also to take your children representative johnson posted the
[53:04.760 --> 53:11.080]  following on his facebook page will probably be banned now the algae and county health director is
[53:11.080 --> 53:16.200]  threatening to take parents to court if the department has reasonable belief that their
[53:16.200 --> 53:20.840]  child has been exposed to a covet nineteen and they don't follow their every order this can
[53:20.840 --> 53:25.160]  include actions by the county to take the child away from the parents and into the government's
[53:25.160 --> 53:30.920]  custody the county commissions needs to step up and fire this reckless and tyrannical health
[53:30.920 --> 53:35.720]  director for threatening to take away people's kids for the possibly coming in contact with someone
[53:35.720 --> 53:40.920]  who has covered this absolutely should not be happening in this county and then i've got it
[53:40.920 --> 53:44.600]  all over the country all over the world that's their announcement that's their plan i just
[53:44.600 --> 53:51.800]  showed tv viewers the cdc plan for the country last year for this year and they're putting in
[53:51.800 --> 53:58.200]  all of the world it's all you indirectly here's the actual letter where they tell them all of the
[53:58.200 --> 54:03.720]  threats and all the rest of the garbage and other letters that other folks have found so
[54:05.400 --> 54:11.000]  that's where all this is going and here's the health code they try to use
[54:14.040 --> 54:18.520]  says take into custody and transport the individual to an appropriate emergency care and treatment
[54:18.520 --> 54:24.280]  facility for observation examination testing diagnosis and treatment if they suspect they
[54:24.280 --> 54:28.760]  might have covered which is now widespread in more than half the country's had conservatively
[54:29.480 --> 54:35.080]  which they know it's never going to get fixed because it is a prion crystal they have introduced
[54:35.080 --> 54:44.120]  aerosolized mad cow disease that causes spongiform encephalography into the public and i've had
[54:44.120 --> 54:51.080]  medical doctors and scientists on laying all that out and now in new york and illinois and texas and
[54:51.080 --> 54:57.080]  everywhere else i've seen every day i see articles about judges saying i'm taking your children because

[1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:18.680]  they're trying booster shots they're angry that this is going after children wow and the media
[1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:24.440]  is trying to spin it to boosters alone no it was about children and about politics and about the
[1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:31.080]  fda being ordered to say this is an authorized shot when it's not because they're like the number
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:38.200]  two and three people at the fda vaccines one of the most important areas the head lady that did

[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:46.040]  certificate bonus right you know absolutely depending on the state and how you get the federal
[1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:50.280]  money some people they murder they get like a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars but
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:56.760]  us today admits 53 thousand to innovate them 53 thousand to snake that down there and let me tell
[1:13:56.760 --> 1:14:00.600]  you they look at you like a cash crop you go in the corrupt hospitals they're not all corrupt
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:04.920]  they're all apples and oranges they're night and day and they don't give you medicine they don't
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:07.960]  give you steroids they don't give you antibiotics they don't give you ivermectin they don't give
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:12.360]  you zinc they don't give you vitamin d you get nothing and they just sit and wait for you laying
[1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:16.680]  there because with covid you're supposed to walk around and stuff and then they can snake that tube
[1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:21.240]  down that throat and get that death warrant money because see your dad your dad would get his social
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:25.560]  security and all his payments millions of dollars if he lives another 15 years they're not they're
[1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:30.760]  going to murder him and then give them just a little piece like the captain the globalist the
[1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:35.240]  banks get like 20 pieces of gold and they kill your dad and they give a half piece of gold or maybe
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:40.520]  a piece of silver to the people that murder him see how that works yeah yeah well thanks
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:45.480]  kurt confirming my suspicions and like i said they all the doctors laughed at us and because
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:49.800]  they're all told because steven cobert makes jokes about ivermectin doesn't matter it's approved
[1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:54.440]  in humans doesn't matter it won the Nobel prize doesn't matter it's known to be antiviral doesn't
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:58.840]  matter it turns your immune system on doesn't matter doesn't matter because it doesn't matter
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:05.560]  if african countries handed out and have no uh covid deaths in the countries that do they don't care
[1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:08.520]  and i don't i don't understand how they go home and look at themselves in the mirror
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:15.560]  well i mean they're unconscious and then they follow orders just like nazis so they feel safe
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:22.920]  and under the nuremberg code following orders to commit crimes does not protect you well thanks
[1:15:22.920 --> 1:15:27.640]  again for confirming my suspicions i'm going to get on my family if possible if you couldn't hand
[1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:32.520]  me off to rob do maybe he can give me some of the online sites that will give him a a fair consult

[1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:25.720]  home deaths seven hospitalizations and the boosters aren't even approved under emergency

[1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:55.800]  those of your listeners that have autoimmune issues please do not take the vaccine any of them
[1:21:56.440 --> 1:22:01.880]  a family of remember mine i tried to warn them i tried to do everything went and got the Pfizer
[1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:07.400]  vaccine after the first dosage they never told me they never told me that she had massive headaches
[1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:12.840]  and it was throbbing like the vein was popping out of her on one part of her brain uh the second
[1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:17.400]  dosage goes and gets a second dose of three weeks later massive tingling throughout the
[1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:24.920]  body and all that two 15 days after the second dosage uh in the emergency room the whole body
[1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:29.880]  shaking you would not believe it they had to put her on a height monitor on a beta blocker
[1:22:29.880 --> 1:22:34.680]  she was blaming it on the anxiety this was ridiculous they give her the MRI they gave her
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:41.400]  the cascades whatever she's got a blood clot in her arm uh then the doctors the two neurologists
[1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:46.600]  while she had the second hospitalization said to her reported on bear because we acknowledged
[1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:52.280]  this that we concurred that this could be an answer's effect from the vaccine but we're not
[1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:59.640]  at liberty to report it because it's more than 14 days for crying a lot it was a 50 day right now
[1:22:59.640 --> 1:23:06.840]  um she uh oh she went to see the endocrinologist to see she also had scraped disease and then
[1:23:06.840 --> 1:23:11.160]  under canal just trying to push a booster on her for crying out she just had the Pfizer and all of
[1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:16.200]  a sudden she's having all these reactions and telling her it's okay to take the booster i couldn't
[1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:20.840]  believe it i just couldn't yeah these guys do what they're told yes she's in deep trouble uh i'm not

[1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:44.840]  cancer anti spike protein and that stuff is just replicating her body did a good job it ordered
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:51.720]  her body to produce this to supposedly stop it and then it starts eating holes in her capillaries
[1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:57.400]  and so that's what's happening and it starts eating holes in her brain eating holes in her lungs

[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:57.800]  fizer's own reports but they've confirmed are releasing it onto us and and but it's worse than
[1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:02.840]  that they're also finding new spike proteins that are different than the shot in texas and florida
[1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:08.280]  and they're pretty sure that the globalist hit texas and florida by spraying it into the air
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:13.640]  so they could then try to have us be really sick and then fall to our knees i mean this is a foreign
[1:26:13.640 --> 1:26:18.040]  globalist bio weapon takeover brother so your family member is doing the right thing getting
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:24.840]  hell out of there yeah also quick note here in vegas on the news this morning i've regretted you
[1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:32.920]  can't buy at any uh jones feed store nothing like that unless you have a photo proof of you with a
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:37.800]  horse they will not sell you i've regretted here at the feed store absolutely my wife was up in
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:44.040]  Omaha and a bunch of her family had covered so she went to Whole Foods to get uh colloidal silver
[1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:50.600]  which a new nih study just came out of mexico city a two-year study with corona virus family and
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:54.760]  then they did the last year uh with corona and i don't sell any silver products folks they try to
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:59.720]  say i was selling it's a cure i was never selling it's a cure but there was that big study saying
[1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:04.600]  that it does kill viruses well of course silver does hospital spray all over everything so they
[1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:10.200]  don't want you to know about anything and so that is so disgusting uh that that's going on i mean
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.920]  wow well that you just go out to a horse rental place like you're on horseback riding and
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:19.160]  take a photo with a horse and you know go do it i mean that's i mean if your life depends on i've
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:24.200]  never said steal or civil disobedience but if your family member's dying it was me i'd go in there
[1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:29.320]  and i'd steal the freaking i've remitted and leave the ten dollars for it screw them but again oh
[1:27:29.320 --> 1:27:34.840]  i'm sorry i don't know if it's a story my wife goes into Whole Foods and they said oh we don't sell
[1:27:34.840 --> 1:27:42.600]  that anymore this is leasing Omaha because people think it treats covid so again anything you might
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:47.880]  protect yourself with anything that might give you a shot they don't want it because why they want
[1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:54.200]  us dead i i didn't see the story where'd you see this on the news uh here in vegas this morning
[1:27:54.200 --> 1:27:59.480]  it was on the local news uh i believe it was channel eight news this morning guys look that up so

[1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:23.080]  of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet but now it's come to the surface
[1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:28.760]  that's actually a positive thing and so yeah trump did an overall great job they stole the election

[1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:57.000]  fontanamo bay up in canada and how veterans that criticize that are being called terrorist and
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:02.520]  censored i mean it's just it's absolutely insane but it shows the love affair that the globalist
[1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:07.480]  tab with radical islam we've got some big developments in afghanistan turns out biden set the whole thing

[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:26.520]  in a moment but i want to just tell listeners something a lot of times things are hiding in
[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:33.560]  plain view and even i don't realize it and then the lord works the mysterious ways we got a limited
[1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:38.280]  supply of a high quality multivitamin in there was a whole food multivitamin which means it's
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:45.960]  the high end and it's organic it's concentrated and then it sold out pretty quick and we'd only
[1:34:45.960 --> 1:34:51.080]  put a limited order in well i had told our research crew hey you can come out with a few
[1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:53.880]  supplements that you think are best sellers that are high quality that people are going to like
[1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:58.520]  and then i'm like a month ago when it came in i said hair and beard formula they go hey that's
[1:34:58.520 --> 1:35:02.920]  a really popular product and i said why don't you just say hair beard and nails and skin this is
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:06.760]  just as good for women i wouldn't look at the ingredients i said man this is really nice it's
[1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:12.280]  really strong formula too and then yesterday i was a couple days ago i was sitting in my
[1:35:12.280 --> 1:35:17.400]  office looking at the multivitamin bottle and i was looking at this bottle and i'm like this
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:22.920]  has got all the same stuff and in some cases even more and i said this is really a multi

[1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:41.960]  it's confirmed they're killing us it's confirmed it's causing strokes and heart attacks it's
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:46.360]  confirmed it's causing cancer they knew it in all the studies on previous animal studies with
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:51.480]  similar vaccines uh i mean i just can't believe it even i'm blown away at the same time the two
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:55.880]  head fda scientists came out and said you shouldn't have boosters you shouldn't give it to kids and
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:00.520]  you shouldn't be under un control and we shouldn't have said it was authorized it's not authorized
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:06.200]  it's a still emergency i mean that is a big deal it didn't brother praise god oh yeah honestly i think
[1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:11.800]  that has to be the nail in the coffin to be honest because i mean you i go after these
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:15.880]  vaccinated people you know i try to find the statistics giving them you know the documents
[1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:20.520]  and all the good stuff you know that you know you've provided through your research and all that
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:25.080]  good stuff and you know i show them well you know i show them the documents and they call it
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:30.840]  junk science they call it mumbo jumbo they call it fake news now i'm like are you kidding me these
[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:36.840]  are documents these aren't coming off snopes these are not coming off some kind of phony you know
[1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:44.440]  basement if no uh you know websites up anything like that and it's mostly your family that comes
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:51.320]  at you like i don't know what i have to gain to guide you i'm sure i have i have quote long-term
[1:38:51.320 --> 1:38:57.240]  friends i've known that basically i go you never call me anymore i call this one guy up i've known
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:03.080]  for 10 years and he goes listen you need to take the shot and i said well i guess or he said or i'm
[1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:08.600]  done i'm not i said good we're not friends anymore i told them fu too i said fu you're a coward to
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:13.640]  hung up so i mean screw these people man they're idiots they cannot believe this is happening
[1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:18.520]  they have stock home syndrome and they're going to find out so screw them all right and i'm sorry
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:22.520]  if your family doesn't get it i wouldn't and i'm just telling you i wouldn't even be nice to him
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:26.440]  about it i'd say hey listen you want to murder yourself go ahead but i'd keep delivering them
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:30.680]  documents delivering them articles and never shutting up because because somebody's going to
[1:39:30.680 --> 1:39:34.520]  get sick and then the others are going to wake up but if you don't warn them up front they'll
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:39.880]  stock home syndrome and will never admit it happened but you'll have limited damage if you
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:44.680]  keep getting to their face that makes sense yes sir let me here's an example if you knew
[1:39:46.200 --> 1:39:52.440]  that there was a black widow that you saw crawl into the sheets of say let's say you were visiting
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:55.640]  your brother's house you go to the bathroom you're walking by you see a black widow
[1:39:55.640 --> 1:40:00.680]  crawl into the sheets and you go back you tell your brother hey i saw a black widow you might
[1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:05.560]  want to kill it and he says i don't believe you i'm getting in the bed right now well he you're
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:10.040]  his brother he should trust you but wouldn't you physically try to stop your brother let's say well
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:14.920]  let me show your brother you know you don't touch my bed and then he slaps you you know it doesn't
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:20.280]  make sense but see it's so scary to them subconsciously that they're being targeted like this that
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:24.360]  they it's too scary you understand that the government and the cdc wants to kill them does

[1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:09.800]  basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:14.520]  holding on to a job and i heard dr griffon your show and i listened to it so the first one i got
[1:45:14.520 --> 1:45:19.480]  was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you
[1:45:19.480 --> 1:45:22.760]  came out with that too you have you know with the deep burden source you know and i got really
[1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:28.200]  excited about that so i took it and then in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:33.720]  like my brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again
[1:45:33.720 --> 1:45:38.760]  and over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take
[1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:43.160]  basically all of your supplements they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like
[1:45:43.160 --> 1:45:48.040]  recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but
[1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:52.920]  anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist system
[1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:57.800]  and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother

[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:17.800]  sight the vision the strength the satanists don't know what they're missing believe me i've dipped
[1:48:17.800 --> 1:48:23.640]  into the devil a little a long time ago i know their energy source and the power of the holy
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:31.560]  spirit is infinity compared to their weakness this is real strength this is honor this is will
[1:48:31.560 --> 1:48:37.640]  this is determination this is life and i am simply a tiny pathetic vessel
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:47.880]  it's reflects a microscopic amount of god's light back wow got a big special guest joining
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:51.240]  us is being censored being attacked we'll tell about it when we get there we got a bunch of
[1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:55.160]  news that ties into it only afghanistan thing i've not covered afghanistan a lot compared
[1:48:55.160 --> 1:49:00.360]  everybody else because it's all part of a larger psi op and unless you just cover the whole psi
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:05.640]  op it actually helps to get on me but we're gonna be breaking it down and looking strategically
[1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:09.480]  where this goes and how it's part of breaking down the borders to europe and destabilizing the whole
[1:49:09.480 --> 1:49:14.920]  planet part of the great reset but let's rampage through more of your calls right now anonymous

[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:43.960]  position a chair of the department of medicine um just really quick i'm just gonna say what
[1:49:43.960 --> 1:49:50.760]  i what they i'm gonna read this more than 40 years of continuous nih funding and numerous
[1:49:50.760 --> 1:49:57.320]  research grants from the department of defense um served as a principal investigator on more than
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:50:05.720]  half a dozen COVID-19 clinical trials including those that test the effectiveness of Pfizer
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:15.000]  biotech COVID-19 vaccine and remdesivir treatment um he was on channel five news for over a year
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:19.640]  talking about the vaccine talking about the you know the whole COVID
[1:50:19.640 --> 1:50:30.680]  um you know the all the the cases um yesterday we got a notice that he was he died unexpectedly
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:39.480]  and it blows my mind wow and of course he'd been vaccinated correct i don't know you know i don't
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:45.400]  know but i i don't i don't want to say he was because i honestly don't know i just feel like
[1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:53.800]  he was so into it you know what i mean but then again it was he not taking it and big did they
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:58.040]  all get a kickback i mean i don't know well we know that you kickbacks a little but let me explain
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:04.440]  this to people right now i didn't need to see the statistics that came out a month ago of massive
[1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:09.400]  increases of hospitalizations and death i talked to doctors i see it i talked to people around the
[1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:13.480]  country now it's all over the news and i'm not saying oh i'm smart i'm saying i can see it there
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:18.360]  are so many people dying right now including young people and a lot of times they test negative they
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:23.480]  go oh you've got something else but the point is it is the prions it is shedding i feel really sorry
[1:51:23.480 --> 1:51:28.040]  for medical workers that have got to be around this or those that have to administer this stuff
[1:51:28.040 --> 1:51:31.880]  because i had a top former board Dietrich scientist on your stage you talked about how
[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:36.120]  they were you know getting infected with stuff they were making back in the 80s and 90s and so
[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:39.800]  stuff that wasn't supposed to leave a dangerous because of where they're cooking these cell
[1:51:39.800 --> 1:51:45.320]  structures up where they're making these vaccines is in these vats of human cells that are already
[1:51:45.320 --> 1:51:52.680]  contaminated and so that's really the big problem here and then you're like oh well great the new
[1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:58.200]  mRNA system you know it'll it'll fix that no it's grown in human tissue as well and using human genome
[1:51:59.080 --> 1:52:04.360]  and so the entire human genome so you're a medical worker what is your view on all this and where
[1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:11.640]  this is going no i don't take care of patients but i've been working in the in the hospitals for
[1:52:11.640 --> 1:52:19.800]  over 25 years but the only thing i can say is that i i know this this is not right i know it's not
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:25.640]  really a vaccine i won't go near the vaccines i'm not giving it to my daughter i don't believe in
[1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:31.960]  any of this and i i'm not going to get it so i'm not probably not going to have a job soon um and
[1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:37.720]  uh i don't even know i can't even say any more than that it's just i i don't trust it and that's it
[1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:45.480]  absolutely god bless you thank you for calling this is a revolution it's a genetic engineering
[1:52:45.480 --> 1:52:51.720]  resolution revolution that's claus schwaub that heads up the fortune 500 all combined forces they
[1:52:51.720 --> 1:52:56.360]  all agree and it's the corporation's forcing all this he says it's a revolution where we take your
[1:52:56.360 --> 1:53:03.240]  body over i mean it's a world id the medical id off that he says we're gonna have a carbon tax
[1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:07.080]  that tracks everything you do and controls you we will then shut down the main economy
[1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:11.480]  and make you serve us and do what we want we want to get rid of voting and rid of you having any
[1:53:11.480 --> 1:53:17.000]  freedom i mean his wikipedia says he wants to get rid of nation states and rid of people voting
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:24.200]  and only have the un stakeholders run things it's freaky he says he wants global dictatorship
[1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:30.600]  and the response of the new york times is oh alex jones is mean he questioned a mass shooting
[1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:36.360]  the same new york times it lies about wmds i mean it's there it's here they're assaulting us
[1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:42.760]  all right up next here carlos in canada thanks for holding her on the air welcome thank you
[1:53:42.760 --> 1:53:49.800]  very much alex well you know claus schwaub may have wet dreams but for for me i'm not impressed
[1:53:49.800 --> 1:53:55.560]  he's just the president i'm sort of organization like president of the chamber of commerce uh no
[1:53:55.560 --> 1:54:01.240]  no i agree but even but but they now have corporate global power because they run the un as well
[1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:08.120]  well they have corporate absolutely but the people that own the shares of those corporations
[1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:14.120]  have been accumulating those shares by creating economic panics over the centuries since the
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:21.000]  year 1773 i think we discussed this in the past and what we see here is nothing but a manifestation
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:24.920]  of what about the roth childs or with the british empire staging panics to buy everything up and
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:30.520]  that's what the great reset is and they have the shares okay in the hands of people let me let me
[1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:35.400]  explain to you a little bit about the mechanism the mechanism is that they have the shares signed
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:43.160]  but not dated and these are deposited so people like uh zuckerberg and etc etc i would like to
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:49.160]  have them show the shares of their holdings because they're in the hands of of portfolio managers
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:56.920]  and brokers two of them vanguard and black rock are the largest holders to 20 trillion dollars
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:55:03.160]  okay and black rock is trying to bankrupt the small rental market to buy it up yeah among other
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:09.560]  things but this is predictable unless something is done to turn this inversion okay uh let me
[1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:14.760]  explain uh you and i had a conversation about you were a guest on the show you're you're a you're a
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:20.360]  big smart guy up in canada evolving government everything else let me give you a little point
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:27.320]  two points of information you when you and i were in together we had 1.1 million downloads
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:33.080]  within four days and what people wrote to me from all over the world but what was shocking to me
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:39.480]  was how these very important people people that i thought would never have followed were actually
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:45.160]  saying hey i saw you carlos i didn't know hey wow you know and it was amazing but what i want to
[1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:50.520]  tell you is this this is an inversion and i tell people these very same things look you don't try
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:55.640]  to convince people that are in in stuccom syndrome don't don't try to convince them they would they
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:56:01.320]  cannot listen to you because i know they're psychologically at magill university i came
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:08.200]  in 14 years after cameron at magill university was doing the experiments on the brain etc so you
[1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:15.320]  know i i know a little bit about this okay montreal was a center for this kind of research i tell you
[1:56:15.960 --> 1:56:25.720]  bill gates video it's dated 2000 in 2005 april the 13th he gave a presentation to the cia
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:33.240]  and in that presentation he talked to vaccines and how he had the wherewithal to the cia to implant
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:41.400]  these whatever elements of the vaccine in the brain so that he could create and this mantle
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:46.280]  i know what part of the brain he was talking about the right the right temporal lobe area
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:51.560]  where you have people have religious experiences etc when you're stimulated you know i forgot about
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:55.880]  his speech to the cia tell us about that because i want to do a whole special on her i want to have

[1:57:50.760 --> 1:57:55.480]  on the air trying to move quicker hey alex welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:58:00.040]  voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:06.840]  hold of you for a year okay i'm a double amputee and i have bacteria infection on my lung that
[1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:12.760]  will never go away uh living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years
[1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:18.280]  that almost killed me living defense brought me back i wanted to just quote from the bible
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:25.400]  jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:32.920]  up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[1:58:32.920 --> 1:58:38.760]  and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another that's
[1:58:38.760 --> 1:58:43.320]  right where we're at brother and that's because god's name is on the founding of this country no
[1:58:43.320 --> 1:58:50.280]  matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because god created this country i've
[1:58:50.280 --> 1:58:56.120]  been fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop
[1:58:56.120 --> 1:59:01.560]  their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[1:59:01.560 --> 1:59:07.160]  operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flatfooted
[1:59:07.160 --> 1:59:13.720]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why
[1:59:13.720 --> 1:59:18.600]  it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:23.240]  show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information
[1:59:23.240 --> 1:59:27.560]  warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda and we've also got to get personally prepared
[1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:31.160]  and one of the number one things to do is high quality storable food we've got the best food

[2:00:08.440 --> 2:00:15.320]  there is no longer any doubt the globalists have gone for full de depopulation collapse of
[2:00:15.320 --> 2:00:20.280]  civilization ops people ask why are they building more buildings why are they buying up houses
[2:00:21.240 --> 2:00:25.320]  they intend to move the third world to the western world we're being given the most deadly
[2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:30.520]  injections in the west because we expect money we expansion funds we expect new process they want
[2:00:30.520 --> 2:00:36.200]  to get rid of that american dream get rid of that western dream and just have slave colonies they own
[2:00:36.200 --> 2:00:41.480]  and control and they also have two different economy tracks that are operating at the same time
[2:00:41.480 --> 2:00:46.680]  but but but carlos i held you over you were going to finish up that point and that question
[2:00:46.680 --> 2:00:51.240]  i had for you and get back into the date of that again i think the crew was able to pull it up but
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:55.160]  i'd forgotten about that billgate speech where they talked about implanting things through
[2:00:55.160 --> 2:01:01.320]  vaccines in our brain i mean back at the time i made a video called vaccine brain eating vaccines
[2:01:01.320 --> 2:01:05.960]  was the headline because the pentagon others said oh we'll give troops with ptsd a shot that makes
[2:01:05.960 --> 2:01:10.360]  them happy it'll destroy the part of the brain associated with you know religious experiences
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:16.520]  high brain waves also depression just take that out make people emotionless uh and so and so what
[2:01:16.520 --> 2:01:21.000]  do you think about them finding nano metal and everything the japanese government confirming
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:25.080]  the spanish government confirming i know that's where you're originally from spain i mean that
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:31.080]  they're they take it's all coming out but they're still just moving forward uh carlos well the danger
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:38.200]  of course is from what i said to you before you've got people like a real software salesman
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:44.920]  bill gates essentially has no authority whatsoever intellectually or academic whatsoever to inform
[2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:51.560]  the cia about the how the human brain area where the mirror neurons are people who know the brain
[2:01:51.560 --> 2:01:56.360]  know a little bit about this but the mirror neurons are empathic they give you empathy
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:02:01.240]  this is something robots will never have okay and these mirror neurons are in children they're in
[2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:06.360]  animals they're in you and me and everybody else and they give the impression to you as a human
[2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:11.720]  being in the in the ego of self what experience someone else is having when they're being chopped up
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:17.880]  or or shot or bombed or whatever and your your feelings of emotion and kindness and the willingness
[2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:23.480]  to help this this empathy is in the mirror neurons and they're part of your brain well here is mr bill
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:30.680]  gates a software salesman telling the cia that he's has a wherewithal to inject through a vaccine
[2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:38.600]  so that he can eliminate in human beings those feelings those those fundamental ideas of religion
[2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:49.560]  and belief in god etc etc the video on youtube is called a 2005 bill gates pitch to cia etc etc
[2:02:49.560 --> 2:02:57.640]  so you say it one more time on the two yes say one more time 2005 bill gates pitch to cia
[2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:05.080]  all right well i mean i knew he had patents on implantable nano particles that direct to
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:09.880]  kia is they can control i knew they were rolling it out and by the way did you see the un's new
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:15.160]  global directive on the world id medical id system carbon id it is written by the bill
[2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:20.840]  and the gates foundation the rockefeller foundation it says blockchain controlling your
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:27.880]  activities with the app so now they're coming up blockchain as his patent showed to control us and
[2:03:27.880 --> 2:03:34.280]  and and and track us through that pretty incredible yes but we have to stop alex you and i and everybody
[2:03:34.280 --> 2:03:39.720]  else stop returning the tennis balls these keep people keep throwing problems and problems at us
[2:03:39.720 --> 2:03:45.080]  and we keep returning them meanwhile they have an agenda of unlimited tennis balls that keep
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:52.120]  throwing us and we keep responding listen god's seventh cavalry it's on its way let me tell you
[2:03:52.120 --> 2:03:57.000]  why i know a little bit about this around four o'clock in the morning you and other people like
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:03.720]  myself have woken up with clairvoyance with a clarity of thought with ideas that we thought
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:10.440]  my god yes that's the answer and we know exactly what to do in history in religion that's called
[2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:16.440]  the holy spirit coming down as a tongue you know from whatever okay but in reality what it is it's
[2:04:16.440 --> 2:04:22.040]  it's what you call discernment and discernment is coming all over the world soldiers military and so
[2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:26.120]  on oh there's no doubt that i'm being given knowledge it didn't come from my brain i mean
[2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:29.880]  it's always right it's like god's going to give us the super weapon systems to defeat them that's
[2:04:29.880 --> 2:04:35.720]  what you're saying yes and there are individuals all over the world trust me some of them are leaders
[2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:43.160]  of countries that are having these these evening early morning clairvoyant ideas at this vision

[2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:19.240]  all right people want me to talk about afghanistan what's happening over there you're going to get
[2:06:19.240 --> 2:06:25.560]  what you want right now it's very important compared to them giving us gmo shots that turn
[2:06:25.560 --> 2:06:30.120]  our bodies into factories of deadly synthetic spike proteins that give you cancer and blood clots
[2:06:30.120 --> 2:06:33.480]  that are going to kill billions of people are going to die the next few years i mean it's already
[2:06:33.480 --> 2:06:37.800]  happening it's just insane i've got all the statistics out of israel out of greece in places
[2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:41.800]  where they give the shots and the mass deaths happen already showed that last hour i've had medical
[2:06:41.800 --> 2:06:46.360]  doctors scientists on i have all the previous animal studies they try to suppress i mean they
[2:06:46.360 --> 2:06:51.960]  plan this out very very well but afghanistan is important because it's part of the great reset
[2:06:51.960 --> 2:06:58.120]  it's part of migration replacement migration they want to break the social construct and the
[2:06:58.120 --> 2:07:04.040]  social compact in the western world under cloud and pivot strategies to bankrupt everybody and
[2:07:04.040 --> 2:07:08.200]  they want the u n to then direct these giant migration flows are saying four to five million
[2:07:08.200 --> 2:07:13.000]  afghans almost all of military age men on their way most of people that quote got rescued
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:17.800]  for military age men because under islam it's forget the women and children men go first
[2:07:17.800 --> 2:07:25.720]  biden doubles down on afghanistan exit triumph in belated recycled rambling speech that was
[2:07:25.720 --> 2:07:29.480]  pathetic but it's designed to be that way to demoralize the country ahead of him stepping
[2:07:29.480 --> 2:07:34.440]  down and bringing in kamala biden national security advisors says us may give economic aid to taliban
[2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:42.440]  which is al qaeda house republicans lead opposition to taliban funding this is just insane facebook
[2:07:42.440 --> 2:07:49.080]  instagram blacklist account of mother of slain marine because she criticized biden but the
[2:07:49.080 --> 2:07:53.720]  taliban is on facebook and twitter i'm not on facebook and twitter but the taliban that chops
[2:07:53.720 --> 2:08:00.040]  people's heads off if they're uh you know not in the taliban that's okay and fox news reports
[2:08:00.040 --> 2:08:04.680]  taliban could use social media to paralyze america with footage of citizens left behind
[2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:11.480]  which is all part of the demoralization globalist plan taliban supporters hold mock funerals with
[2:08:11.480 --> 2:08:20.200]  coffins draped with american flags and it just goes on from there so this gentleman's a well-spoken
[2:08:20.200 --> 2:08:26.680]  uh veteran of the infantry in canada jeremy mckinsey he put out a video that got over six
[2:08:26.680 --> 2:08:31.160]  million views it got taken down on the newspapers were calling him an extremist because he doesn't
[2:08:31.160 --> 2:08:38.520]  want to bring millions of afghans which where they want to take them to canada so uh raging descent
[2:08:38.520 --> 2:08:44.200]  dot com is the website he's a 14-year combat veteran canadian infantry and serve in afghanistan
[2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:50.360]  he's a comedian professional boat rocker and host of rage cast live show where he talks about
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:55.720]  politics culture and current events for the past three years currently residing in sesquacher won
[2:08:55.720 --> 2:09:00.920]  canada until he is taken to the gulag for wrong thing which is actually happening and so if you
[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:05.240]  see canada today america tomorrow they're now announcing in california michigan other areas
[2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:09.400]  are going to come to your house if your child was near someone with covet and take them for 14 to
[2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:14.760]  15 days to a covet facility will you let them take your children away that's always the final thing
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:20.600]  the tyrants do to see if you're fully under their control and so here's a little bit of one of the
[2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:25.880]  videos they took down uh that they're so angry at they're calling extremist here it is oh yeah my
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:29.960]  name is jeremy mckenzie i'm a canadian forces afghanistan combat veteran i deployed the second
[2:09:29.960 --> 2:09:35.400]  battalion world canadian regiment in 2007 um to fight these people actually to fight oh mark
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:40.680]  otter's extended family they're all participate they love the taliban in which he was a member of
[2:09:40.680 --> 2:09:45.960]  and i absolutely detest and abhor the fact that they would even call him such a thing as a child
[2:09:45.960 --> 2:09:51.240]  soldier calling him a soldier at all is an insult to the waffen ss let alone me these are not people
[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:55.560]  that wear uniforms these are not people that obey things like the rules of war or the gene of the
[2:09:55.560 --> 2:10:00.040]  conventions they use women and children as human shields they burn people with acid for not reading
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:05.880]  the right magic books they're horrendous they're monstrous human beings they were raping children
[2:10:05.880 --> 2:10:09.480]  they didn't care they would blow up there as many of their own civilians as they would do us
[2:10:09.480 --> 2:10:14.520]  that it didn't matter at all and now canada is leaving 150 million dollars on the table meant
[2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:17.960]  for veterans because well we just don't have the time for that while the government spends more
[2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:24.120]  money since 1870 than than any other government in canadian history in this environment no we
[2:10:24.120 --> 2:10:28.760]  just don't have enough money but we will make oh mark otter the taliban terrorist a multi-millionaire
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:31.480]  and we're going to tell everybody that's got a problem with that to leave the building and
[2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:36.120]  leave the premises it's including me including other canadian forces veterans and i have to be
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:40.760]  here to say this because many of the people from my platoon that were killed by oh mark otter's
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:46.520]  little club aren't here to say that anymore they're all dead christianics isn't here anymore
[2:10:46.520 --> 2:10:51.320]  sergeant donnie lucas isn't here anymore so that's why i'm here because this is outrageous this is a
[2:10:51.320 --> 2:10:56.360]  travesty and i i'm sick of i'm sick of staying home and staying on the couch and watching everybody
[2:10:56.360 --> 2:11:01.240]  just not saying anything because this is wrong this is not what canada stands for it's not the
[2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:04.840]  country that i signed up to fight for and it is certainly not the country that those men and women
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:10.600]  died for when i was over there fighting against him and his family and his friends so i guess i'm
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:15.000]  the bad guy now if that's how it's going to be then that's how it's going to be okay and i guess
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:20.200]  that's what's him going on to an event where they worship the communist leader of canada worships
[2:11:20.200 --> 2:11:23.800]  uh the guy that says you're gonna have to have your bank account taken if you don't take injections
[2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:29.080]  they worship this oh mark otter character who got over 10 million dollars because because he got
[2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:35.080]  arrested in afghanistan and detained and then put in guantanamo bay poor baby and so here to
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:39.800]  talk about it is jeremy mckenzie jeremy you're an evil demon you're a veteran you're a bad guy
[2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:44.840]  and you don't want all these precious afghans to come to your country well i mean that's part of
[2:11:44.840 --> 2:11:50.200]  it alec i mean it's just another facet of the you know a multifaceted attack on western civilization
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:53.960]  you talk about it a lot of other people talked about it and that was that was a couple years ago
[2:11:53.960 --> 2:11:59.400]  now and i wish things had gotten uh better since then that is you know worse it's gotten so much
[2:11:59.400 --> 2:12:04.120]  worse since then it's it's almost indescribable i mean we've been talking about this for a long
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:08.360]  years ago you've been proven right about this yeah what the hell's going on in canada because we know
[2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:12.040]  everything happening to you is now moving here you're the you're the beta test so is australian
[2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:19.640]  what is your view as a veteran of afghanistan about why this is happening uh man well i mean you
[2:12:19.640 --> 2:12:24.200]  hit it earlier it's um you know well besides the the multinational you know the banking cartel and
[2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:28.200]  all the money involved and everything which is what this is really all about but the demoralization
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:34.360]  campaign it's very very difficult to believe for a second this is not intentional this is
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:39.160]  incompetence to a level that i i have trouble believing and i have a pretty good imagination
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:43.320]  i can i can get going and i have a really difficult time believing that this is um
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:47.480]  this is an accident we just biden's just incompetent the enjoin chiefs are just
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:51.240]  and everybody's just incompetent we're just going to leave america potentially canadian
[2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:55.880]  citizens we don't know we can't get a clear answer there um it's treason i i've been saying this
[2:12:55.880 --> 2:13:01.160]  it's treason we're really 80 million dollars of equipment we're gonna and it turns out biden was
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:04.520]  as you know now the documents go out was telling the government cover up there's going to be a
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:11.240]  collapse don't tell people so they wanted this to happen absolutely and i think that i think
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:15.960]  that you're right it is a demoralization campaign because it's it fits the pattern of of what i've
[2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:20.920]  been seeing and if you look at it it's not just the military it's everywhere it's academia education
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:25.800]  on tv on your netflix on your phone everywhere you go our people have been under a sustained
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:31.640]  psychological warfare attack now for 18 months never mind the previous you know 10 years or so
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:37.720]  if you look up something called the biterman report by e b i not biden by ed er m a n dr
[2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:42.040]  alford biterman he actually debriefed and maybe you're familiar with this um american g i's and
[2:13:42.040 --> 2:13:47.480]  p o w's that were captured by the koreans and uh and chinese and the korean war and uh when you
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:53.080]  look at the methods that they used to elicit uh you know compliance from from them that's where
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:58.360]  all the modern brainwashing came out of there exactly brainwashing it's that's how they perfected
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:02.360]  it and they're doing all of the same things to our people right now this is weaponized psychological
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:07.320]  warfare obama repealed these rules way back years ago making propaganda legal to use on american
[2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:11.320]  citizens i don't even think we had those rules here in canada and it's just non-stop all the time
[2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:14.200]  there it is right there they want to break you mentally they want to demoralize you because
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:19.160]  demoralized people give up demoralized people don't fight and you know and you know what's wrong
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:24.440]  with you and i and our listeners because the more they do this the more i get angry and fight them
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:29.960]  the more energy i get so how do we take the what's why is it not working on us how do we transfer
[2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:36.040]  that to other people i'm not sure it could just be the head injuries i've had i'm not i'm not sure
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:41.160]  i have a lot of injuries too joe rogan thinks that might be the secret actually it could be you
[2:14:41.160 --> 2:14:44.920]  gotta get punched in the face a few times you have to or else you're just not living your
[2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:49.080]  life to your full potential but uh you know again the demoralization so i mean it's it's
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:52.680]  literally our job and our responsibility to uh the people that see this and if you're willing
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:14:55.640]  anybody that's willing to go out there and take a stand and say this is wrong we're not doing this
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:15:00.280]  this is not our way of life this is not america this is in canada this is this is crazy not this
[2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:04.280]  is communist nonsense and uh you know if you guys want to you know hop on our backs and you know
[2:15:04.280 --> 2:15:08.920]  we got big backs and big shoulders let's go you know this is um you want to fight let's go and
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:13.000]  you're seeing signs of it everywhere i like to you were talking earlier about the you know the
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:18.040]  death star analogy it's been bad for years things have been really you know blackpilling and scary
[2:15:18.040 --> 2:15:23.400]  and insane but i'm starting to see you know as if the the the earth itself is paved over in concrete
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:27.160]  and little blades of grass are just starting to poke up somehow and they're they're losing their
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:31.400]  minds they got a sensor everybody they got to block everything and ban every and they still
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:37.080]  can't win that's right this giant power grab is an exercise of weakness because they know their
[2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:40.920]  neural orders coming to an end because of a giant spiritual awakening or whatever you want to call

[2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:14.040]  never defeated the british 250 years ago if we didn't have a lot of optimism and we didn't persevere

[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:19.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show we've got jeremy mckinsey who's a popular talk show host and a
[2:20:19.640 --> 2:20:25.880]  well-spoken guy and a lot of his videos end up getting censored so i wanted to get him on so that
[2:20:25.880 --> 2:20:30.680]  he could get you get this out to a larger audience as well but i wasn't trying to say why are we
[2:20:30.680 --> 2:20:38.040]  special mr mckinsey seriously we know darpa we know the pentagon you know the globalist up on top
[2:20:38.760 --> 2:20:44.120]  are trying to suppress individuals and leaders of every race color and creed and so we really
[2:20:44.120 --> 2:20:49.560]  should ask why is this audience so awake why do the globalist fear it and and i think the answer
[2:20:49.560 --> 2:20:54.600]  is we're awake we've had live experiences we've seen things we understand how things integrate
[2:20:54.600 --> 2:20:59.800]  together and so much of the public is actually i think your head injury comment is is a arc type of
[2:20:59.800 --> 2:21:04.920]  it kind of the extreme end of it they've never had life experiences they've never gone through pressure
[2:21:04.920 --> 2:21:09.640]  they've never gone through stress they're domesticated and so they really are almost in a trance
[2:21:09.640 --> 2:21:14.760]  they don't know any better and can't believe that predators have taken control that's why they embrace
[2:21:14.760 --> 2:21:19.000]  radical islam that's why they embrace all these forms of tyranny because they just want to run
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:24.520]  up a white flag to it in a form of mass Stockholm syndrome give me your take on that and and what you
[2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:30.360]  think of afghanistan and where you think this is all going and how do we ignite that survival
[2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:38.600]  instinct in people everywhere to promote western civilization again before it's too late yeah i
[2:21:38.600 --> 2:21:41.720]  mean i think you i think you nailed it earlier i've been talking about it the same i mean we
[2:21:41.720 --> 2:21:45.880]  always come back to the same point is fear people are afraid they don't want to believe that this
[2:21:45.880 --> 2:21:49.640]  could be possible that these people that they've trusted that their institutions they trust the
[2:21:49.640 --> 2:21:53.880]  tv all of this stuff is actually working against them it doesn't like them in fact it hates them
[2:21:53.880 --> 2:21:57.480]  and it's making them do things that are going to hurt them and it's just it's such an evil thing
[2:21:58.280 --> 2:22:02.280]  to comprehend and you're probably right it does take some kind of life experience for me
[2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:07.160]  it was um you know the military in afghanistan the whole thing and i just alex i i two plus two
[2:22:07.160 --> 2:22:11.880]  has to equal four at the end of the day and i'm we're burying guys and i'm going to funerals and
[2:22:11.880 --> 2:22:15.560]  i'm seeing people you know the no more social media updates because he's committed suicide and
[2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:20.360]  he's gone and they're gone two plus two must equal four what is going on what are we doing why did
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:24.440]  this happen what and there are no answers and now there's no accountability they're going to do this
[2:22:24.440 --> 2:22:29.240]  in afghanistan they're going to and and this to see it as it's heartbreaking and as it's
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:34.040]  simultaneously as much as it's heartbreaking it's enraging at the same time and like i i said before
[2:22:34.040 --> 2:22:38.200]  the break there the little blades of grass are starting to come up you're seeing guys uh quitting
[2:22:38.200 --> 2:22:42.600]  a lot of guys are not okay with this and to see you know decades of work and sacrifices go down
[2:22:42.600 --> 2:22:46.920]  the tube and if they're not even acknowledged that they've made a mistake or that this is wrong
[2:22:46.920 --> 2:22:50.520]  and we're going to and just arm the taliban and give them all of our money and guns and you've
[2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:53.640]  got guys like that i don't know if you're familiar with this guy marine corps lieutenant colonel
[2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:59.000]  steward shellor who's resigned his commission oh we applied the client administration yeah
[2:22:59.720 --> 2:23:04.520]  oh yeah you think he's going to be the last guy hell no there are so many marines i mean
[2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:09.000]  they sign up they believe this stuff this isn't a job to them this isn't a job to nine to five kind
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:13.480]  of thing they live they breathe this these guys get branded we get tattoos like these flags this
[2:23:13.480 --> 2:23:17.400]  stuff this means something to us this this is a huge this is part of our way of life this is who
[2:23:17.400 --> 2:23:21.240]  we are as a people if you think we're just going to roll over and go away you're going to come here
[2:23:21.240 --> 2:23:25.720]  and you're going to target our people our children now let's bring this let's bring this up society
[2:23:25.720 --> 2:23:29.240]  let's bring this up in canada they're saying veterans of the main terror threat in the u.s.
[2:23:29.240 --> 2:23:33.080]  they're saying they're main terror threat they're claiming we're all white supremacists if we believe
[2:23:33.080 --> 2:23:38.040]  in sovereignty in the west they're trying to start a war general honoree general austin general
[2:23:38.040 --> 2:23:44.200]  milley they're really trying a marxist linanist playbook i believe they're preparing false flags
[2:23:44.200 --> 2:23:50.280]  to blame us they say the evil right-winger terror attacks are coming clearly they really do have some
[2:23:50.280 --> 2:23:54.680]  plan to try this i don't think it's going to work most of the military i know and most of the police
[2:23:54.680 --> 2:24:00.120]  i know have really woken up yeah me too i don't think it will either i think they're arrogant
[2:24:00.120 --> 2:24:03.960]  and i think they've been high you know riding high on the hog for 20 years since 9 11 and they've
[2:24:03.960 --> 2:24:08.280]  just been winning and winning and we're like defeated by success if you will you know you can't
[2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:12.200]  the hunger to fight and win is defeated when you're living in you know sleeping in silk
[2:24:12.200 --> 2:24:19.240]  no you're right prosperity kills adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters that's right and
[2:24:19.240 --> 2:24:23.080]  you know there's there's going to be a pushback and there's a lot of like these guys take a while
[2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:28.440]  to get going it's the guys that are the most capable and the most likely to stand up and say that
[2:24:28.440 --> 2:24:33.960]  you know like i like this clip from uh star trek uh the one with the board the car what was it uh
[2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:38.200]  this far no farther this is the line that's it there's there's no cut that's it i'm getting off
[2:24:38.200 --> 2:24:42.840]  the couch now and uh these guys because they know what it means and they know it's a stake and they
[2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:45.800]  know what the consequences are what you said before you're going to break i want you to elaborate on
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:50.440]  that the the the blades of grass the globalists hit the panic button their own internal documents
[2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:54.280]  have come out four or five years ago when trump got elected not that trump was perfect for balson
[2:24:54.280 --> 2:24:58.440]  arrow they saw that as a sign of the populace uprising and they said oh my god our whole agenda
[2:24:58.440 --> 2:25:03.160]  is in trouble implement operation lockstep which is the virus release they didn't do this out of
[2:25:03.160 --> 2:25:09.880]  strength they did out of desperation they boiled the pot too fast alex the frog is getting out of
[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:14.440]  the pot they got greedy and they want to go go go and too many people and and sometimes i i wondered
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:19.080]  about this like are things going better or worse than you think and and if they weren't what's the
[2:25:19.080 --> 2:25:22.840]  what's the sun's zoo quota if you're strong you you project weakness you want your enemy to walk
[2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:26.840]  into a trap and destroy himself if you're weak you project strength and they're threatening people
[2:25:26.840 --> 2:25:29.400]  we're going to do this to you we're going to do that we're going to vaccine passports there's
[2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:33.320]  going to be consequences you're going to pay we're going to destroy i'm they're bluffing i'm
[2:25:33.320 --> 2:25:37.080]  going to i'll call their bluff i think they're full of crap and i think they're scared and i think
[2:25:37.080 --> 2:25:41.320]  they're worried about it and we've got an election happening in canada right now all the establishment
[2:25:41.320 --> 2:25:46.280]  parties are the same they're all in the same page truto is being chased out of every town he goes to
[2:25:46.280 --> 2:25:51.960]  and the tv says he's polling at 35 percent very popular ridiculous and the other guy is defending
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:55.320]  him saying there's no place for this there's only one and then you've got the ppc in canada max
[2:25:55.320 --> 2:25:59.320]  bernie the only ones defending canadian values and they're pretending they don't exist and he's
[2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:03.880]  getting the wrong paul treatment they're the other party we won't even say their names on television
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:08.520]  it's a charade and uh they're scared you wouldn't need to do this if you're strong this is something
[2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:14.520]  you would do if you're weak and i i smell it i smell blood alex i agree with you and here's
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:17.800]  what i want to say to all the veterans i know and i know it's stressful and i know they come back
[2:26:17.800 --> 2:26:23.720]  and then they don't know what to do don't commit suicide go help other people that are worse off
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:28.040]  than you empower yourself you know believe in god or reach out to however you have to do it
[2:26:28.040 --> 2:26:31.880]  to the universe to fight this evil and i don't want the violence against the globalists because
[2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:36.120]  we're winning politically we're winning culturally they could short circuit that but but at the same
[2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:42.840]  time fight with everything you've got politically and and culturally to say no to this long before
[2:26:42.840 --> 2:26:47.240]  you blow your own head off and then if we do have a civil war don't go out and just shoot cops and
[2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:52.600]  people on the street like they trace the dude you know there's a globalist that i really want to see
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:57.480]  live until there's nuremberg too but at the same time if we're gonna have a war you know the top
[2:26:57.480 --> 2:27:03.960]  guys are the enemy not the cops yeah and and these guys are like i say the same thing don't do it
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:07.560]  because your family needs you your community needs you and you maybe think a lot like terrible
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:10.920]  about yourself i know a lot of these guys and they just feel like garbage you know and they
[2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:14.680]  leave the military they don't want to do and they deploy to forward operating base living room couch
[2:27:14.680 --> 2:27:18.760]  and then they get into the bottle and it's a downward spiral people think the world of
[2:27:18.760 --> 2:27:22.840]  you guys and you could make such a difference and have such an impact you matter you're so
[2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:27.000]  important and people are going to need you and if this does go crazy if things go sideways
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:30.680]  we're not going to be the ones to start it all right like you said we're not we're not we are
[2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:34.920]  not terrorists we're the we're the opposite of that we're the people they are coming up to go
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:42.280]  ahead with it we need to be smart and we need to go after target well yeah i mean we won't
[2:27:42.280 --> 2:27:45.400]  start it but we'll finish it you know what i mean don't start something you can't finish guys and
[2:27:46.280 --> 2:27:49.640]  i'm not going to attack anybody or do anything like that but if they're stupid enough if they like
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:54.120]  your you know joe rogan has said this if they open that door and those floodgates come open you
[2:27:54.120 --> 2:27:58.520]  are going to open the door to something a dimension that you cannot even fathom and the stuff that
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:02.280]  is going to come pouring out of there you're going to rue the day i guarantee you that
[2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:07.480]  yeah these globalists really are isolated in their own world they have no idea how much
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:12.840]  trouble they're in you know and and on top of this i want to point this out have you noticed
[2:28:12.840 --> 2:28:17.960]  that there's listen to this that you've got soft unit special operations forces have now gone rogue
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:22.600]  to rescue american citizens in afghanistan because that's who americans are that's who canadians are
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:26.360]  that's who the western man is you're not going to wait for somebody to tell me to go rescue our
[2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:31.400]  own people women and children to leave a single person behind is treason and we don't believe
[2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:35.880]  though the first flights out were nothing but afghan men that those guys literally climbed over
[2:28:35.880 --> 2:28:41.400]  women to get on those airplanes on yeah and i want to say this because you know some of those people
[2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:45.240]  risked so much for us the interpreters or families that they were killed and they didn't you tell us
[2:28:45.240 --> 2:28:49.880]  you were over there tell us when we come back great interview jeremy mckenzie raging dissonant

[2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:18.920]  the un globalist attack but none of our leaders other than bolsynaro had trumped a little bit
[2:31:18.920 --> 2:31:24.920]  to seem to understand that and so no one is addressing the fact that this is a 21st century
[2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:31.400]  corporate economic war on the general population and the conversion of the planet into a high tech
[2:31:31.400 --> 2:31:39.320]  technocracy with a global id global medical system global medical control id and of course a

[2:33:15.560 --> 2:33:20.920]  remember listeners i love you to death the globalist work around the clock to try to
[2:33:20.920 --> 2:33:25.560]  suppress everybody this is a test to see if they can kill us a test so they can silence us a test
[2:33:25.560 --> 2:33:31.320]  that they can take over but these two top scientists the directors of vaccine program
[2:33:31.320 --> 2:33:38.040]  the number one and number two guy leaving the fda and saying we did not authorize this it's not
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:42.840]  authorized they lied this is political don't take the booster shots don't give shots to kids i mean
[2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:50.600]  that is just so huge so massive and we have the big chinese whistleblower lady it was on a few
[2:33:50.600 --> 2:33:54.360]  days ago she's in the war room today with even more information to look for that at three p.m.
[2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:59.000]  today but your calls are coming up next segment jeremy mckinsey really well-spoken guy when
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:03.400]  about him back soon i've been kind of ranting the last two segments you were trying to make a point
[2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:08.920]  about uh you know leaving the women and children and all the rest of what you saw in afghanistan
[2:34:08.920 --> 2:34:13.480]  so you've got the floor of the rest of the segment just as a veteran of afghanistan to vent and also
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:18.840]  i know this was a couple years ago and they censored it but uh this omar qadar guys just to
[2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:22.680]  give people an example of why would trudeau give him ten and a half or whatever it was million
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:28.840]  dollars because he was a portable taliban or whatever well his rights were violated
[2:34:31.160 --> 2:34:33.320]  but then it's okay of all of our rights get violated
[2:34:33.960 --> 2:34:38.040]  guantanamo bay that's right he was detained in guantanamo bay his father was actually his
[2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:42.280]  father was also a convicted terrorist bailed out by john kretschen in the 90s it's interesting
[2:34:42.280 --> 2:34:46.920]  and we don't know how far the liberal government of canada's ties go to the taliban to to the cotter
[2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:51.720]  family it's very suspicious and they would rather pay this guy out and then fight however they are
[2:34:51.720 --> 2:34:56.120]  going to fight us in court i'm involved in a in a mass tort litigation howie sacks and henry
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:34:59.320]  over the mefliquin poisoning of all of our guys the malaria medication they gave us they knew
[2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:02.840]  it was toxic they knew it was poisonous they did it anyway because that's what they do and that's
[2:35:02.840 --> 2:35:06.280]  another thing like you think i'm going to take these vaccines the last time the government told
[2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:09.560]  me to just take it it's good for you don't worry about it now i got brain damage now all these
[2:35:09.560 --> 2:35:13.080]  guys have brain damage and all these guys have you know committed suicide as a result of this
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:17.560]  yeah i'm gonna wait i'm gonna wait i'm gonna wait and see what happens um and again it's just one
[2:35:17.560 --> 2:35:21.720]  facet of it and that was that was what you know spawned all of this i needed to know what was going
[2:35:21.720 --> 2:35:26.600]  on i needed to figure it out and and uh it's everywhere it it turns out you know a lot of
[2:35:26.600 --> 2:35:31.240]  people yourself included have been right about this there there is a cadre if you will of people
[2:35:31.240 --> 2:35:35.560]  that are more interested in uh you know this international clique of bankers that are just
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:38.920]  taking everything over they're going to run everything it's international communism you're
[2:35:38.920 --> 2:35:42.520]  not going to have any rights you're there is no going back to normal people i just want to go to
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:47.720]  it's like go back to normal there is no more normal man it's fight or die that that's where we're at
[2:35:47.720 --> 2:35:51.240]  and there's i think believe in edmund burk quote i can't remember if that's what it is but
[2:35:51.800 --> 2:35:55.800]  too many people our government's included uh there's a couple of guys you mentioned ran paul
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:35:59.560]  you know down in the states and and we have a couple people up here max burney here in canada
[2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:02.600]  however the rest of them are content to do nothing and the quote says something like
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:07.960]  for evil to succeed all that it doesn't require your consent it doesn't require your support all
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:12.360]  it requires is that you do nothing just do nothing and that's what everyone's content to do i'm
[2:36:12.360 --> 2:36:16.120]  going to look away i'm going to bury my head and say and i'm going to do nothing you're helping
[2:36:16.120 --> 2:36:21.160]  you're helping this transpire by not intervening you know and uh that that upsets me and and it's
[2:36:21.160 --> 2:36:25.080]  so important especially down there you know you guys the united states and uh there's not a lot
[2:36:25.080 --> 2:36:29.160]  of us up here in canada but we're we're crazy we're maniacs okay we've got lumberjacks and we
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:32.600]  we're out of our minds we'll we will fight to the end okay the devils brigade we've got a we've
[2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:37.560]  got a history together but if they get america if america goes down that's it that's curtains
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:41.080]  because who's going to come who's going to come save you uh you know you see that the horror of
[2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:45.000]  this stuff that's happening in australia and the united kingdom and that sucks but it's like uh going
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:48.680]  down on a plane you got to put your own respirator on first before you can help someone else we got
[2:36:48.680 --> 2:36:53.640]  to dig our own our own uh you know ourselves out of our holes here first and then you know
[2:36:54.360 --> 2:36:57.960]  if we're fortunate enough maybe we can we can go help them bail them out absolutely in trudeau
[2:36:57.960 --> 2:37:02.600]  just to interrupt trudeau just came here instead we're using this is the great reset we're going
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:07.800]  to have environmental lockdowns this is just the new way of life claus schwaab the un says that
[2:37:07.800 --> 2:37:13.720]  as you said this is a permanent takeover they say oh just comply you'll be able to go outside oh sorry
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:20.280]  more shots still can't go outside i mean are people going to figure this out i don't i don't
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:23.560]  know i think a lot of them are afraid and i think that i mean this is their only this is the only
[2:37:23.560 --> 2:37:27.720]  shot we got i'm just coming at it with like just unapologetic confidence like i don't care what
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:32.120]  you do to me i don't care if it takes four months or 400 years you can kill me if you want i'll you
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:36.760]  know with my last breath i will spit blood in your in your face and say f you uh i'm i'm never
[2:37:36.760 --> 2:37:41.720]  gonna give up okay and uh you know they're gonna keep coming they're gonna keep trying it's um
[2:37:41.720 --> 2:37:44.840]  you know it's gonna be a long haul but people need to see that confidence they need they need
[2:37:44.840 --> 2:37:49.080]  leadership and that's a huge problem they need they need to be you know inspired and led and we
[2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:54.360]  don't have that right now for now but it's slowly i totally agree the biggest problem is our leaders
[2:37:54.360 --> 2:37:58.840]  that are half awake are not addressing it as a global government corporate authoritarian
[2:37:58.840 --> 2:38:04.040]  banking takeover the great reset a post industrial world guys roll the b-roll of the combat robots
[2:38:04.040 --> 2:38:07.560]  walking around the united states because they want to replace humans because humans won't
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:12.280]  follow criminal orders all the time i mean this is literally in claus wobb's own word a robot
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:19.160]  takeover a post human world right and and there the foundation of their ideology and what they
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:23.720]  want what drives them their fuel that makes them get up in the morning is greed control me me me
[2:38:23.720 --> 2:38:27.960]  you know it's evil the and manipulation and deceit that's what gets them going that's what fires
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:32.440]  them up what we have is the love of our children and our people and our communities and our culture
[2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:36.040]  and our history which one do you think is going to win the long game i'm totally comfortable
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:39.720]  with our position i know there's going to be worse days ahead think we're going to have losses it's
[2:38:39.720 --> 2:38:44.280]  going to get rough it's going to get ugly but ultimately in the end there is literally we can't
[2:38:44.280 --> 2:38:48.440]  we literally can't lose it's impossible unless they're unless they want to destroy the earth and
[2:38:48.440 --> 2:38:52.520]  kill themselves i mean if that's their plan i don't think so i think they've been off more than
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:57.000]  they can chew they're not their grandfathers they are not the original you know 1800s like the
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.560]  rockefellers and the warburgs and the duponts and all these people these are not hard hunter

[2:43:08.360 --> 2:43:13.880]  experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:19.400]  the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80 of the population hooked
[2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:25.000]  up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who have
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:30.600]  awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see

[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:20.920]  from the live feed the alex jones show right now from free world news dot tv because currently
[2:48:20.920 --> 2:48:25.000]  that's the new url that we're now four or five months they've not banned remember all the other
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:29.800]  ones like 79 days of hell and all the rest of ones that they then banned on twitter and facebook
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:34.120]  and instagram well this one's been going for a while it's still going to be a great url you
[2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:37.960]  may make a website out of it or something i've also been contacted by some folks who want to use it
[2:48:37.960 --> 2:48:41.720]  for a website i'll probably just let them do it but as soon as it gets banned on twitter and facebook
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:46.360]  and the rest of it we've got some other urls ready but that's how you get over the enemy they
[2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:51.160]  wouldn't be censoring if they had total control they don't they have gone for broke though that gives
[2:48:51.160 --> 2:48:56.120]  them a real power they're fully committed they're mass murdering they're depopulating they know that
[2:48:56.120 --> 2:49:01.080]  will trigger stock home syndrome in most people but it won't do it to all of us and their own people
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:05.000]  are going to start leaving in droves as i've predicted the achilles heel and now it's happening
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:11.080]  at the fda the number one and number two heads of vaccine programs say you shouldn't have boasters
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:16.840]  you shouldn't give it to children it's not been approved the white house just said this is an approved
[2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:27.560]  vaccines it's not whoa ultra ultra ultra ultra ultra massive in fact i never tell all and i never
[2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:33.800]  tell that the morning show uh american journal harrison smith what to put a headline up or
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:42.280]  what to cover i'm saying i want this covered front and center this is ginormous gigantor colossal
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:51.080]  megalodon oh huge all right who's up who's been holding the longest i really appreciate you guys
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:50:00.200]  holding that would be gradient in pennsylvania welcome gradient hello alex how are you doing
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:05.560]  today i'm just pretty i'm ready for war i'm just totally that's probably i just feel like i can
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:11.000]  take on about a hundred people go ahead yeah i feel the same way i get where you're going with us
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:17.240]  it's uh it feels like we're living in a dream a bad dream one of the themes it seems to be today is
[2:50:17.240 --> 2:50:24.680]  is you know not just but people around you uh just don't get it you try to talk to about it
[2:50:24.680 --> 2:50:30.520]  they quote mainstream media a few people get it very close to me that's about it but i work in a
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:35.640]  quite a few different environments i'm a contractor for for it so i'm out in the field all the time
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:43.640]  primarily supporting medical environments and their systems and people they don't they don't
[2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:49.160]  get it um if they're living in fear i mean everybody's mask and i've used to people driving
[2:50:49.160 --> 2:50:54.360]  around in math and i think they buy out of the narrative that we're in this together we're in
[2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:58.280]  danger we're safe together even though they're being hit with the vaccine and turning into
[2:50:58.280 --> 2:51:02.840]  factories that grow it to kill themselves and those around them turning them into viral suicide
[2:51:02.840 --> 2:51:09.640]  bombers oh i i see people around me who have taken it and their costs won't go away they've
[2:51:09.640 --> 2:51:13.720]  got acne that won't go away so they get something else that they think's going to treat it it's not
[2:51:13.720 --> 2:51:20.040]  getting any better it's getting worse um we saw the biggest crowds trump got up to 200,000 in
[2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:25.720]  pennsylvania so i know it's a paradox you know the cities are hell holes in pennsylvania but a
[2:51:25.720 --> 2:51:29.800]  lot of the rural communities and in the small towns seem to really be awake i mean so i i
[2:51:29.800 --> 2:51:35.640]  guess we're you like in philadelphia no i'm in pettsburgh right in the center of the democrats
[2:51:35.640 --> 2:51:44.920]  man surrounded uh corrupt voting allegedly um all that stuff but what i wanted to bring up as well
[2:51:44.920 --> 2:51:50.920]  was we talked about people not being awake and all this stuff it keeps coming up a comment i started
[2:51:50.920 --> 2:51:56.200]  to bring it up to a guy at work and uh he goes you know what i don't know won't hurt me and i said well
[2:51:56.200 --> 2:52:02.600]  yes it it does that's that's the worst thing you can possibly say perception is reality it's not
[2:52:02.600 --> 2:52:09.880]  correct and he went on to say he's comfortable living at home because he works remote i don't
[2:52:10.680 --> 2:52:15.880]  living at home watching netflix and just letting the world go by and there's a lot of though that
[2:52:15.880 --> 2:52:20.200]  they're counting on that to cause the collapse he doesn't get that the great reset is designed to
[2:52:20.200 --> 2:52:27.160]  cause mass starvation in the third world and then final enslavement here i i get that you're right
[2:52:27.160 --> 2:52:33.880]  and i just wanted to say thank you very much for for being on the on the front lines of this
[2:52:34.440 --> 2:52:38.440]  i'm almost the point where i'm going to be out there myself because people don't get it i see
[2:52:38.440 --> 2:52:42.520]  the world getting angry or angry i'm i drive quite a bit between well that's what claus
[2:52:42.520 --> 2:52:47.080]  swab said see this guy's happy as he's at home other people aren't it's going to cause a collapse
[2:52:47.080 --> 2:52:53.080]  of that's what we know you're angry soon you will burn the city's our great reset see what he's doing
[2:52:53.080 --> 2:53:03.000]  oh yeah and you've said it before to people stay calm it's take a step back take a deep breath
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:09.480]  this is all real you're going to cry you're going to realize that oh my god i was wrong
[2:53:09.480 --> 2:53:18.920]  not necessarily alex is right but you were this is huge this is big wake up breathe realize
[2:53:18.920 --> 2:53:24.760]  process that's the hardest thing to do is process this but once you do it's going to get easier
[2:53:24.760 --> 2:53:30.680]  and you can be awake and in the end it's going to get better but people keep saying absolutely
[2:53:30.680 --> 2:53:34.920]  just admit it's a war but no that's part of human development and just get right with god
[2:53:34.920 --> 2:53:40.440]  and then and just don't be violent up front if you're ready to be violent use that energy
[2:53:40.440 --> 2:53:44.200]  and information war to warn others and be a leader god bless you great and great points

[2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:36.520]  would say it's just just as a reminder it's not if it's when they're going to require us to have
[2:54:36.520 --> 2:54:41.080]  these shots and if we don't want the shots we're going to need to go off grid or we're going to
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:47.880]  need to i totally agree and the amish don't have autism did you know that i yeah and they also don't
[2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:52.920]  have uh a bdv there uh there's a lot of things that they don't have because they uh and they
[2:54:52.920 --> 2:54:57.560]  they treat everything homeopathically as well i mean i could talk about i was in florida and i ran
[2:54:57.560 --> 2:55:01.720]  into a bunch of amish families that had gone to the beaches to walk and i saw their sons and daughters
[2:55:01.720 --> 2:55:05.480]  and they all look so alive they were like little creatures that were looking at us and interested
[2:55:05.480 --> 2:55:09.160]  when we smiled at them and then you saw everybody else were like zombies not wanting to look us in
[2:55:09.160 --> 2:55:15.160]  the eyes was so sad yeah they're they're unbelievable people they they love uh they love special kids
[2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:19.960]  you know they uh they have a lot of schools for special needs kids here again i could go off on
[2:55:19.960 --> 2:55:24.680]  the amish for a long time what i want to talk about though is is uh supply chains at the moment now
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:28.840]  i'm i'm i have a lot of products made unfortunately overseas because it's the only possible way to
[2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:34.520]  do that and supply chain is in a really rough spot i know you kind of jokingly and passing instead
[2:55:34.520 --> 2:55:39.080]  multiple times that you're going to think about buying a buying a log cabin in the woods and going
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:43.720]  off grid i would just say alex if you're thinking about doing that do that now i know i'm sorry
[2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:48.520]  too late for me i'm gonna i mean i'm gonna i'm gonna go down with the show but give me a call
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:53.560]  my friend give me a call if you need some uh something for uh durable power i i still have
[2:55:53.560 --> 2:55:58.200]  to i understand brother no no i mean that's great i'm just saying i'm putting my full energy into
[2:55:58.200 --> 2:56:03.640]  fighting them i've got an exit plan uh but yeah absolutely i mean this is just i prefer everybody
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:07.560]  else isn't going to be politically active or engaged yeah that's a whole other area of research
[2:56:07.560 --> 2:56:12.040]  but you're right moving in close to the amish i think you're saying is a smart move you got to
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:17.480]  do what they do you have to focus on clean clean energy that that you create you have to focus on
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:22.200]  clean water clean but wouldn't you agree getting a piece of property right up next to them and then
[2:56:22.200 --> 2:56:25.720]  and then get in an element because they work with people they're nice folks isn't that smart to
[2:56:25.720 --> 2:56:30.280]  kind of move in close to the amish yeah if you're not if you're and if you're not super close by
[2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:34.200]  you got to build the network they're they're a little standoffish but you got to provide value
[2:56:34.200 --> 2:56:39.400]  to them to get into their community which i have but um you know that's the thing is we got to live
[2:56:39.400 --> 2:56:43.640]  like them because they they don't take the shots they're not doing it like i said i i said it in
[2:56:43.640 --> 2:56:48.120]  past and again they were made to do that leaving switzerland in germany 500 years ago four or
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:51.800]  fifty years ago because they were being oppressed their kids were being taken they weren't having
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:56.680]  their rights and they just exited and left and i really appreciate your call we're out of time there

[2:57:49.800 --> 2:57:55.800]  michael indell that he's so optimistic that he's so positive no it's that type of optimism that
[2:57:55.800 --> 2:58:00.440]  built this country we would have never defeated the british 250 years ago if we didn't have a lot
[2:58:00.440 --> 2:58:05.960]  of optimism and we didn't persevere george washington lost most of his major battles that he kept
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:10.600]  fighting for six years and finally we won well michael indell has been fighting as a man in the

[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:25.640]  generations and they've got four children that go there and they said you're gonna take the shots
[3:02:25.640 --> 3:02:30.200]  when they come out and you're gonna wear a mask and so they just said this year just like a month
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:34.440]  when school started they got a big building right across the street not to mess with the school just
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:39.880]  what they're able to get available and half the school and and half the people that have donated
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:43.960]  over the years the grandparents and all that gave money and they just moved across the street
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:48.120]  and now they have more people than the school has and that other school is probably gonna fold

[3:06:09.960 --> 3:06:15.160]  hello and welcome to the fourth hour of the alex jones show i'm your guest host dr andrew
[3:06:15.160 --> 3:06:23.400]  kaufman and we are facing a very serious time right now and no one is facing a dimmer future than
[3:06:23.400 --> 3:06:30.600]  the children and right now it is back to school time of year so we're thinking about the children
[3:06:30.600 --> 3:06:35.880]  going back into the public schools around the country and what they're going to face so let's
[3:06:35.880 --> 3:06:51.800]  take a look at this video before we talk about this very important topic
[3:06:51.800 --> 3:07:08.520]  i expected school to be a little bit different in the beginning but i didn't think it would stay
[3:07:08.520 --> 3:07:13.880]  this way all year long every one of us knows that young children are not affected by this virus
[3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:17.400]  we've shoved it to the side and we've said we don't care you're still gonna wear a mask on your face
[3:07:17.400 --> 3:07:22.520]  every day five and six year olds you still can't play together on the playground like normal children
[3:07:22.520 --> 3:07:27.960]  seven and eight year olds we don't care we're still going to force you to carry a burden that was never
[3:07:27.960 --> 3:07:37.400]  yours to carry shame on us i grew up looking into the faces of my friends holding their hands
[3:07:37.400 --> 3:07:47.080]  kisses hugs sharing crayons learning beside them laughing as i was pushed down the side
[3:07:47.800 --> 3:07:56.760]  as i play catch but now i won't know i were all like that i must live in fear
[3:07:58.840 --> 3:08:03.000]  two years ago would you have sent me to a school who never let me touch anyone
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:08.840]  no sharing or i had to walk in lines and never be close to anyone
[3:08:10.280 --> 3:08:16.600]  never see my friends faces and cover mine would you have sent me to a school like that
[3:08:17.240 --> 3:08:24.280]  because a stranger said they know what's best for me all for a virus that will never kill me
[3:08:24.280 --> 3:08:33.480]  we have no idea what will happen to us how damaged we will be please stand up
[3:08:34.520 --> 3:08:39.000]  because if you don't who will stand up for me
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:58.120]  it gives me chills every time i see that piece to be observing the effect it's having on these
[3:08:58.120 --> 3:09:04.200]  children and now we have actual real live data about some of these effects i just
[3:09:04.200 --> 3:09:10.120]  want to briefly review before we bring our guests because at the end of the show once we talk to
[3:09:10.120 --> 3:09:15.240]  our guests who's coming on i think that you'll see how we can take matters into our own hands and
[3:09:15.240 --> 3:09:21.080]  really do a lot to protect our children and allow them to have the freedoms that that they deserve
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:27.480]  that we had growing up but if we could first just look at the first slide which is a report from the
[3:09:27.480 --> 3:09:35.720]  cdc about emergency department visits and there was an already ongoing study that captured data
[3:09:35.720 --> 3:09:43.880]  from 2019 so we're able to compare how many times children went to the emergency department related
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:49.880]  to mental health complaints and these include things like suicidal thoughts as well as substance
[3:09:49.880 --> 3:09:59.160]  abuse issues including overdoses and we've seen a huge increase 24% in younger children and over
[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:06.840]  30% in teenagers going to the ER for mental health conditions and if we go to the next slide and look
[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:15.880]  at suicide attempts we see that among teenage girls there was a 51% increase in suicide attempt
[3:10:15.880 --> 3:10:22.600]  presentations at emergency departments across the country and this is the cdc's own data so
[3:10:22.600 --> 3:10:29.640]  we've had already clearly quite an effect on the emotional health of the young people in our nation
[3:10:30.440 --> 3:10:37.160]  now if we go to the next slide we can look more specifically at masks and what the effect they
[3:10:37.160 --> 3:10:43.480]  have and there was a study that came out this summer where they looked at the amount of carbon
[3:10:43.480 --> 3:10:49.320]  dioxide that children are breathing in when they wear masks for an extended period of time
[3:10:49.320 --> 3:10:56.360]  and found that it was actually six times higher than what was considered unsafe by the German
[3:10:56.360 --> 3:11:05.000]  government and our own EPA has similar numbers in terms of their regulations so what we're saying
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:11.320]  is that these children are actually breathing in huge amounts of carbon dioxide which is not the
[3:11:11.320 --> 3:11:17.880]  normal state and what happens is when this gets into their blood they end up with an
[3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:25.000]  acidotic state it decreases the pH of their blood making it more acidic which is associated
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:31.480]  with all types of negative health outcomes and finally I want to summarize some of the
[3:11:31.480 --> 3:11:37.720]  psychological harms if we could go to the next slide because I was retained as an expert witness
[3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:46.280]  to try and help parents remove the requirements from school because of the psychological effects
[3:11:46.280 --> 3:11:52.760]  and we see that first of all in terms of understanding speech and language children who
[3:11:52.760 --> 3:11:59.160]  are developing these skills while they are in school at those younger ages especially
[3:11:59.160 --> 3:12:06.280]  use visual information including lip reading and other types of visual cues from the face
[3:12:06.280 --> 3:12:13.080]  in order to help interpret language so this means that by using face masks we're impairing the
[3:12:13.080 --> 3:12:19.480]  ability of them to understand what people are saying to them and since they're developing these
[3:12:19.480 --> 3:12:26.520]  skills at these young ages there is the potential for these problems or lack of appropriate development
[3:12:26.520 --> 3:12:33.160]  to persist throughout their lifetimes and they could end up with all types of deficits in their
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:41.160]  speech abilities if we can go to the next slide some other psychological domains that are impacted
[3:12:41.160 --> 3:12:46.520]  by mask wearing has to do with one recognizing people and their face in other words their
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:52.680]  identity because this is also something that's very important and young school age children are
[3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:58.920]  still developing these abilities and you could imagine how scary it would be not being able to
[3:12:58.920 --> 3:13:07.880]  recognize adults who come into the room often posing in a role of authority and the child
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:13.560]  doesn't even recognize them because of their face being covered and then lastly reading
[3:13:13.560 --> 3:13:19.560]  emotions and this is very very important for social development because in order to form
[3:13:19.560 --> 3:13:24.680]  appropriate social relationships not only with peers but also with adults including teachers
[3:13:24.680 --> 3:13:29.640]  and school aides and other people there needs to be an ability to understand the emotional
[3:13:29.640 --> 3:13:36.280]  state of the other person and there are many emotions that you need to read cues from the
[3:13:36.280 --> 3:13:42.280]  mouth area specifically and that area is completely covered up by the masks and interestingly
[3:13:43.160 --> 3:13:49.000]  happiness and disgust are two emotions that really require this area of the face so
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:55.240]  so many students will not be able to fully read emotions including very important emotions from
[3:13:55.240 --> 3:14:00.920]  other people and this will have a very negative impact on their ability to form relationships
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:09.160]  now that we've seen that there is not only so much potential harm but actual harm being realized
[3:14:09.160 --> 3:14:15.960]  from these policies impacting the freedom of our children I want to talk about our guests
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:21.800]  coming on and her name is Layla Centner and she is the co-founder of the Centner Academy which
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:29.240]  is a private school in Miami Florida and she has done what I have been advising people to do for
[3:14:29.240 --> 3:14:36.280]  a long time which is to take things into their own hands and to say no and set things up the
[3:14:36.280 --> 3:14:42.840]  way that you want them to be and so she has established her school as free from these mandates
[3:14:42.840 --> 3:14:51.160]  so let me welcome Layla Centner to the show Layla are you with us hi doctor how are you hi it's
[3:14:51.160 --> 3:14:58.200]  great to see you Layla so we only have a minute to finish out this segment but perhaps you could
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:05.400]  just tell us briefly what was the inspiration for you having the courage to take on this major task
[3:15:06.840 --> 3:15:12.200]  the inspiration was our children our future they're everything and if we allow this in
[3:15:12.200 --> 3:15:18.840]  doctor nation if we allow this child abuse in schools we're setting our next generation
[3:15:19.400 --> 3:15:27.000]  up to be obedient servants to a tyrannical government and so we need to put our foot down now
[3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:34.520]  not wait just say no and any parents that have their kids in these type of schools need they really
[3:15:34.520 --> 3:15:40.360]  need to do whatever they can to pull their kids out of schools home school form a pod find a
[3:15:40.360 --> 3:15:46.360]  like-minded community whatever you can because our future is at stake by what we're doing to our

[3:20:15.400 --> 3:20:20.200]  hello and welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your guest host dr andrew caltman
[3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:28.040]  and today we have lila sentner with us who has taken things into her own hands and established
[3:20:28.040 --> 3:20:35.080]  the only school that i'm aware of which has not adopted any covid restrictions is that true leila
[3:20:35.080 --> 3:20:41.560]  are are are you the only school in the world like this you know i'm definitely the only school that
[3:20:41.560 --> 3:20:46.760]  i know of like this unfortunately but i'm trying to lead by example and i'm helping more schools
[3:20:46.760 --> 3:20:53.480]  would follow uh school owners can put their foot down and say no from the moment reopened when we
[3:20:53.480 --> 3:20:59.160]  reopened last september we didn't force masks we didn't do plexiglass we didn't socially distance
[3:20:59.160 --> 3:21:06.440]  kids and we are reopening again next week and while all the schools around us are mandating
[3:21:06.440 --> 3:21:12.520]  masks and seem to have even harsher measures we aren't doing any of it in fact none of my teachers
[3:21:12.520 --> 3:21:17.800]  are wearing a mask and they're very very excited about next school year we have a meet and greet
[3:21:17.800 --> 3:21:26.600]  today um we've had over 80 uh parents walk through the door not one of them have wore a mask and the
[3:21:26.600 --> 3:21:32.120]  teachers aren't wearing masks and everybody is smiling and happy and just so excited about
[3:21:32.120 --> 3:21:38.600]  school restarting without any of the restrictions i have some friends that um go to schools near me
[3:21:38.600 --> 3:21:45.800]  and they're already on lockdown the school hasn't even started and they're the quarantine classes
[3:21:45.800 --> 3:21:51.720]  because somebody's grandfather was tested positive for covid i mean it's it's crazy
[3:21:52.680 --> 3:22:00.120]  yes it is i mean gosh disrupting school before it even begins so back last year when you had the
[3:22:00.120 --> 3:22:09.080]  idea that you were going to operate school like usual what type of pushback did you experience
[3:22:09.080 --> 3:22:14.760]  you know did you lose students what about the community did you get calls from the school
[3:22:14.760 --> 3:22:22.280]  district or the government well fortunately i work for i'm a private school so the government
[3:22:22.280 --> 3:22:28.280]  does not control me i did get a lot of backlash though when i reopened last september i had a
[3:22:28.280 --> 3:22:34.200]  lot of parents who believed that if other children were not wearing masks they were a danger to their
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:40.680]  child so i probably let out maybe 14 kids more 14 um kids from their contract in the
[3:22:40.680 --> 3:22:45.400]  middle of the school year between september and december because the parents were irate with me
[3:22:45.400 --> 3:22:51.320]  they were mad that the teachers weren't masks wearing masks and so what i tell people is look
[3:22:51.320 --> 3:22:55.160]  you need to go where you're aligned and you're obviously not aligned with us because i really
[3:22:55.160 --> 3:23:00.520]  believe with all my heart and soul that children need fresh oxygen their brain needs it their lungs
[3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:06.760]  needs it and they most importantly they need to see their teachers facial expressions they need to
[3:23:06.760 --> 3:23:11.000]  see their smile they need to feel their warmth and they need to read their lips in many cases
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:18.440]  especially for the foreign language class so uh and then from from from january through april we
[3:23:18.440 --> 3:23:25.880]  gained 45 new parents who who came all across the country uh to find us because they wanted
[3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:32.920]  this freedom that we're offering and um when the vaccine media blitz hit um of me not wanting my
[3:23:32.920 --> 3:23:39.320]  teachers to get vaccinated well that caused about 40 parents to leave my school because of it but
[3:23:39.320 --> 3:23:45.640]  then i gained new parents a lot more new parents from all over the country that are actually happy
[3:23:45.640 --> 3:23:51.480]  to be at a school where the owner is willing to stand up for the rights of our children and stand
[3:23:51.480 --> 3:24:01.400]  up for our own immune system and um just mind body and soul wow it's uh just quite a fantastic story
[3:24:01.400 --> 3:24:07.480]  so you're saying that you didn't get any calls from the health department at all because i know
[3:24:07.480 --> 3:24:14.120]  for example and and this may vary in different states but in new york state the even the private
[3:24:14.120 --> 3:24:18.920]  school still have vaccine requirements for the children and they get inspected from the health
[3:24:18.920 --> 3:24:25.480]  department and so you haven't received any type of even a phone call uh from in that context
[3:24:26.760 --> 3:24:32.520]  you know i think it goes to what state you live in based on your governor obviously we've got the
[3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:40.440]  santa's who's a uh um a pro choice governor and allows parents to make wants parents to make the
[3:24:40.440 --> 3:24:47.160]  decisions and does not want to mandate masks so it kind of trickles down unfortunately new york
[3:24:47.160 --> 3:24:53.000]  in california and certain states like that where you've got you know governors who are really just
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:59.480]  trying to take the rights away from parents and push schools to do what their belief is because
[3:24:59.480 --> 3:25:04.280]  obviously this is a belief there's no science behind masking a child for eight hours a day
[3:25:04.280 --> 3:25:08.200]  but there's plenty of evidence that it's harmful to them emotionally and physically
[3:25:08.200 --> 3:25:15.480]  you know it's become a political game that's right i just want to remind everyone out there
[3:25:15.480 --> 3:25:21.000]  that if you look at the actual studies on masks and there are quite a number of them because they
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:27.320]  studied masks long before the covid pandemic um they studied them for the flu and for colds
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:35.080]  and what they found time and time again is that there is actually no benefit in terms of reducing
[3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:41.800]  infection rates either for healthcare workers or for the general public and this is why we never
[3:25:41.800 --> 3:25:46.760]  were asked to wear masks before and and if you worked in a hospital you weren't asked to wear
[3:25:46.760 --> 3:25:52.440]  masks either and you know it's just it's crazy because you know you have all these doctors and
[3:25:52.440 --> 3:25:58.920]  nurses that are they see all the cases of of the flu every year and then but they never get sick
[3:25:58.920 --> 3:26:05.400]  themselves you know so there's just absolutely no reason for it and i understand that the governor
[3:26:05.400 --> 3:26:13.640]  dissent has actually issued an executive order banning schools from making specific requirements
[3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:21.800]  and somehow this was overturned did that impact you at all it's fortunately did not i will tell
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:27.720]  you though i have an amazing group of teachers who actually went to that school board meeting to
[3:26:27.720 --> 3:26:33.320]  protest these masks on behalf of our public school children because they love children and
[3:26:34.040 --> 3:26:41.080]  they don't want any kids wearing masks much less you know a state where the governor even said
[3:26:41.080 --> 3:26:48.360]  it's illegal to mandate it um and unfortunately we've got a school board who is very very left
[3:26:48.360 --> 3:26:53.800]  leaning and they're not looking out what's for what's in best interest of our children they're
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:26:59.800]  only focused on you know this is they're they're following their politics and at the expense of
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:05.880]  our children so somehow they were able to decide on their own and again this impacted only public
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:13.080]  schools however many private schools are following along i mean i have i know people who are going
[3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:17.000]  to private schools where they're spending thirty five thousand dollars a year at a private school
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:22.280]  and they have no choice they're have to send their their kids to school in a mask for eight
[3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:27.960]  hours a day and you imagine spending thirty five thousand dollars the governor said it's illegal
[3:27:28.520 --> 3:27:35.480]  and your school goes and mandates it anyway i mean you know i've been having inquiries
[3:27:36.040 --> 3:27:41.960]  non-stop for for enrollment that's happening even though school is starting in one week
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:46.120]  because of all these crazy mandates and in fact i'm looking for two more teachers to hire
[3:27:46.120 --> 3:27:51.640]  because i've had to open up two more classrooms i mean i'm like the only school doing this and i
[3:27:51.640 --> 3:27:57.160]  don't understand that i'm telling other school owners look there are plenty of people that
[3:27:57.160 --> 3:28:02.920]  believe in freedom and if you're afraid of being sued just have the parents sign an agreement saying
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:08.440]  if their kid catches covid it's not your responsibility right and of course we can't make it
[3:28:10.200 --> 3:28:15.720]  of course it's not your responsibility right i mean we're all responsible for our own health
[3:28:15.720 --> 3:28:23.000]  um you know the school is not uh now although i would say that when the school requires you to
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:29.080]  do procedures that are unhealthy and unwarranted and it causes you harm that they do have liability
[3:28:29.080 --> 3:28:34.440]  in that case yeah absolutely i mean there are kids that are passing out because they're out
[3:28:34.440 --> 3:28:41.080]  in the field running with a mask on i mean i met a mom who whose child literally passed out
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:47.960]  on the field it's like you know i think it's interesting it's a real tragedy leila and
[3:28:48.600 --> 3:28:54.520]  you know it's so um awesome that you are working around this so we'll talk more about it in just
[3:28:54.520 --> 3:28:58.840]  a moment you know the listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic

[3:29:17.400 --> 3:29:22.120]  level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut
[3:29:22.120 --> 3:29:26.120]  down everybody else they crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole
[3:29:26.120 --> 3:29:31.240]  new world order comes out in the open our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken
[3:29:31.240 --> 3:29:35.880]  off there that's why america has got to be taken down you can't have all these other nations enslaved

[3:33:27.320 --> 3:33:34.040]  before the break we were talking a little bit about some of the harms from masks on school
[3:33:34.040 --> 3:33:40.920]  children and i wanted to ask how your kids have been handling the last year and you know
[3:33:40.920 --> 3:33:45.880]  be knowing that they're at a school that's very different so what's your experience been like
[3:33:45.880 --> 3:33:53.160]  with the children well i'll tell you they were doing amazing we had killed covid cases of course
[3:33:53.160 --> 3:33:59.720]  but most of the kids were asymptomatic not one child went to the hospital we had teachers that caught
[3:33:59.720 --> 3:34:05.240]  covid most of the teachers were also asymptomatic and none of them went to the hospital either
[3:34:05.800 --> 3:34:11.400]  so we got through it with no issues and you know this year we're going to have covid cases as well
[3:34:11.400 --> 3:34:20.600]  but we're not mandating uh testing we're not mandating uh um um quarantining the entire class
[3:34:20.600 --> 3:34:26.760]  like some places are doing i mean it's just if you're sick stay home right basically what we've
[3:34:26.760 --> 3:34:34.040]  already known and what we've done all our lives right exactly it's nothing different i mean you
[3:34:34.040 --> 3:34:41.720]  know we had a teacher just yesterday who was sick what she do she's staying home so it's not it's not
[3:34:41.720 --> 3:34:48.280]  rocket science and i feel like this disruption that they're causing kids by stopping them you know
[3:34:48.280 --> 3:34:54.600]  okay somebody in your class got covid now you have to stay home for 14 days then they go back the
[3:34:54.600 --> 3:34:58.840]  next person's going to get covid so what are they going to be home the majority of the year how much
[3:34:58.840 --> 3:35:04.680]  psychological damage is that going to do to a child if they're spending most their time at home
[3:35:04.680 --> 3:35:10.600]  and they're not even doing zoom anymore they're taking home packets right well you know i mean
[3:35:10.600 --> 3:35:17.720]  it's extremely defragmented and disruptive and basically you know i mean i almost think that
[3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:23.560]  really part of the intention of having these policies pushed from the federal level down
[3:35:23.560 --> 3:35:29.240]  is really to dumb down the children and make sure that the biggest thing that they learn right is to
[3:35:29.240 --> 3:35:35.400]  be scared and to do what they're told and in fact last week on the show i had a guest who
[3:35:35.400 --> 3:35:42.600]  is a hypnotist michael grady and he analyzed some video materials put out by the los angeles
[3:35:42.600 --> 3:35:50.120]  school district and what we were able to glean from that is that they're essentially convincing
[3:35:50.120 --> 3:35:57.560]  children that they are responsible for the health of all the adults right the teachers their parents
[3:35:57.560 --> 3:36:02.680]  their family and that that's the reason they need to go along with all these things but that
[3:36:02.680 --> 3:36:09.640]  is simply not the not the case and imagine the amount of guilt and um unfair responsibility
[3:36:09.640 --> 3:36:16.600]  put on the children with that kind of programming yeah absolutely i mean i've heard kids say oh i'm
[3:36:16.600 --> 3:36:23.480]  wearing the mask to protect my grandma i'm wearing the mask to protect you first of all that is not
[3:36:24.040 --> 3:36:31.320]  think about that psychologically you are telling a child to harm your body even though it's causing
[3:36:31.320 --> 3:36:37.000]  you pain because i'm telling you i saw it with my own eyes i saw kids come with headaches dizziness
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:44.120]  nauseousness i witnessed this you were telling a child to harm their body to please somebody else
[3:36:44.120 --> 3:36:50.520]  what does that sound like to you when you know what happens to a young girl that grows up and
[3:36:50.520 --> 3:36:58.040]  lets a guy touch her and she doesn't want to say no because it's pleasing him we are indoctrinating
[3:36:58.040 --> 3:37:05.640]  our youth in a very dangerous direction to silence them and not let them defend themselves or even
[3:37:05.640 --> 3:37:13.640]  say that they're hurting because they're feeling guilty that they're not protecting someone else
[3:37:13.640 --> 3:37:23.800]  it's just like psychologically it's not before how do you do you talk to your students about
[3:37:23.800 --> 3:37:29.080]  these issues because they must be getting these messages from other you know aspects obviously
[3:37:29.080 --> 3:37:36.040]  not from your school but you know do you have any forum to talk about some how the kids are dealing
[3:37:36.040 --> 3:37:44.200]  with these kinds of issues well you know fortunately the majority of our kids by the end
[3:37:44.200 --> 3:37:50.440]  of the school year were not wearing a mask because they we probably had maybe five percent of the
[3:37:50.440 --> 3:37:56.360]  kids left that were wearing masks because as as teachers as educators at you know as a school
[3:37:56.360 --> 3:38:01.480]  owner we were leading by example so when the kids see that we're not wearing masks and they see
[3:38:01.480 --> 3:38:05.480]  their friends not wearing masks they realize wait a minute this is a little bit in conflict
[3:38:05.480 --> 3:38:12.520]  from what I'm hearing outside and we're safe so so one by one the masks started coming off what I
[3:38:12.520 --> 3:38:19.640]  had to do is I had to educate the parents so I brought in experts I brought in Dr. Larry Pilevsky
[3:38:19.640 --> 3:38:24.760]  who's an amazing pediatrician that as you know he's also a freedom fighter fighting the good fight
[3:38:24.760 --> 3:38:32.280]  I brought in Tammy Clark and Kristen and and I had to really teach parents the other side
[3:38:32.280 --> 3:38:37.320]  I had to teach them the harmful impact of masks and I think all of this education
[3:38:38.040 --> 3:38:42.520]  ended up opening their eyes where many of them signed the mask exemption and sent their kids to
[3:38:42.520 --> 3:38:48.120]  school without a mask and then spoke to their kids and told their kids no you're okay you don't need
[3:38:48.120 --> 3:38:53.880]  to wear a mask that's the way I handle it really educating the parents and leading by example for
[3:38:53.880 --> 3:39:01.400]  the kids wow that's fantastic I could imagine though where the parents resistant to to this
[3:39:01.400 --> 3:39:07.560]  discussion I mean you you did have a number of them leave were there any strong emotions
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:14.680]  going or difficult situations that you had to deal with absolutely I had parents some parents
[3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:22.760]  were screaming at me and I had to just say look I'm sorry I I will not mask a force a child to
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:29.960]  wear a mask for your fears our school is all about not living in fear our school is a mindfulness
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:35.560]  school our kids meditate every day we're teaching them by the way the noise in the background is
[3:39:35.560 --> 3:39:45.560]  we're having meet and greet today so our kids and parents are here that's what I love so with
[3:39:45.560 --> 3:39:51.640]  teaching them to not live in fear you know the ones that were completely in fear they just got
[3:39:51.640 --> 3:39:58.120]  angry with me and left and I'm okay with that I'm really okay with that and the new kids that have
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:05.160]  signed up the families are just ecstatic I had so many families tell me today thank you thank you
[3:40:05.160 --> 3:40:09.960]  for all you're doing thank you for standing up for the kids like we were gonna homeschool if we
[3:40:09.960 --> 3:40:15.560]  didn't find your school we're so happy that we found your school and for me I see their smiles I
[3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:20.520]  see the parents smile and I see the kids smiles and it's everything for me it's why I do what I do
[3:40:21.160 --> 3:40:27.080]  you know my husband I we sold our company three years ago this really is a passion project for
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:33.480]  me to help transform education and do my part to create little leaders who are critical thinkers
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:39.640]  and who don't just who aren't just kids that are taught to do what you're told no
[3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:47.560]  challenge us ask us why you know push back come up with your own credit creative solutions don't
[3:40:47.560 --> 3:40:53.080]  let us just tell you do this because I said so that's not a that's not the way to live and that's
[3:40:53.080 --> 3:40:58.520]  not how we should be teaching our next generation of kids well I couldn't agree more and this is
[3:40:58.520 --> 3:41:06.040]  really possibly the most important thing that's going to help us in the future to remain free and
[3:41:06.040 --> 3:41:13.320]  to keep progressing towards you know becoming a better people right better individuals better
[3:41:13.320 --> 3:41:19.560]  men and women is that we always need to think for ourselves and we need to challenge you know
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:26.520]  ideas and not just accept what we're told and it's the exact opposite of the message that
[3:41:26.520 --> 3:41:32.440]  children are getting in the public compulsory school system and many private schools as well
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:43.000]  and it really just never continues to astonish me that people who seem to have importance in
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:48.920]  some of the things such as spiritual philosophy and development or people that are really into yoga
[3:41:48.920 --> 3:41:56.520]  and meditation or if they're into alternative health and Chinese medicine for example and all
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:42:02.520]  of these philosophies are consistent with exactly what you're doing right which is allowing people
[3:42:02.520 --> 3:42:09.240]  to take personal responsibility and to you know realize that they are in control of their health
[3:42:09.240 --> 3:42:16.360]  and well-being but yet so many in fact almost all people who espouse those philosophies are just
[3:42:16.360 --> 3:42:24.280]  caving in and going along with the mainstream so it's really just amazing to see you decide to
[3:42:24.280 --> 3:42:29.880]  do the right thing and of course as I've said many times that when you take it upon yourself
[3:42:29.880 --> 3:42:35.080]  to take these risks do the right thing for the right reason and there's no better reason than
[3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:42.280]  protecting our children's future then the world the universe will reward you and it's happened in
[3:42:42.280 --> 3:42:48.440]  your case right because people are inspired and obviously you're getting more and more
[3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:53.560]  students and interest in your school so let's talk more about that in a moment show them what a real

[3:45:08.920 --> 3:45:15.800]  other than bolsino and trump a little bit seem to understand that and so no one is addressing the
[3:45:15.800 --> 3:45:22.040]  fact that this is a 21st century corporate economic war on the general population and the conversion
[3:45:22.040 --> 3:45:28.680]  of the planet into a high-tech technocracy with a global ip global medical system global medical

[3:47:14.440 --> 3:47:18.680]  hello and welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your host dr antero calvin i
[3:47:18.680 --> 3:47:24.840]  have educator extraordinaire who is defying the covid restrictions leila sentner with me this
[3:47:24.840 --> 3:47:30.600]  afternoon and we have some footage from the sentner academy i'd like to show you to see
[3:47:30.600 --> 3:47:36.760]  what kind of experience that children can get in a school these days despite what's going on in the
[3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:54.600]  world i'm in fifth grade at sentner academy and i love this school so much it's um really great
[3:47:54.600 --> 3:48:00.040]  because in my old school we had to wear a mask all the time and we haven't ever saw each other
[3:48:00.040 --> 3:48:05.320]  without masks but in this school we don't need to wear a mask and then we can communicate easier
[3:48:05.320 --> 3:48:08.280]  connect with each other and it's easier to breathe as well
[3:48:12.200 --> 3:48:16.760]  it was very nice too because it felt like nothing changed since covid and it felt like
[3:48:16.760 --> 3:48:22.280]  everything has just been the same and you have asthma as well yeah when in the first few days
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:26.680]  when you were wearing a mask before you took it off yeah weren't you having a hard time breathing
[3:48:26.680 --> 3:48:31.160]  yeah it was very hard for me to breathe i have some uh at some points i would have to like sit down
[3:48:31.160 --> 3:48:37.160]  take off my mask hoping no one would see me and um i almost fainted a few times too
[3:48:45.320 --> 3:48:49.640]  how can you have a PE program with a mask on where you're depriving kids of oxygen
[3:48:49.640 --> 3:48:54.360]  so these kids just have oxygen-rich blood running through their bodies and most importantly they're
[3:48:54.360 --> 3:49:02.360]  just helping them out
[3:49:02.360 --> 3:49:14.360]  oh
[3:49:14.360 --> 3:49:18.360]  i
[3:49:29.560 --> 3:49:36.200]  well leila uh that uh video is so heartwarming and it's just such a treat to see children um
[3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:42.200]  enjoying life and school the way that they're meant to so uh thank you so much for doing this
[3:49:42.200 --> 3:49:47.320]  thank you doctor it's really a great pleasure of mine and i enjoy it with all my heart and
[3:49:47.320 --> 3:49:53.080]  soul and i hope any other educators out there see this and they're inspired to stand up for
[3:49:53.080 --> 3:49:59.160]  our kids and just say no don't comply the more people that don't comply the sooner this will end
[3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:06.360]  it's the biggest problem we have right now too many people are just walking in a line like sheep
[3:50:06.360 --> 3:50:12.520]  with their eyes closed and doing as they're told even though it doesn't make any sense whatsoever
[3:50:12.520 --> 3:50:19.720]  have any other um owners or administrators of uh school's been in touch with you to that uh you
[3:50:19.720 --> 3:50:25.400]  know they secretly perhaps um are admiring what you're doing or they uh you know actually want
[3:50:25.400 --> 3:50:32.040]  to find out can is this possible from my school as well i have i've had some school owners reach
[3:50:32.040 --> 3:50:37.000]  out to me i've sent them our masking exemption forms that our lawyers have put together um i'm
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:42.360]  really just trying to support them in any way i can there is there is a will there is a way i mean
[3:50:42.360 --> 3:50:47.720]  imagine if you have a school even in new york and and all the parents sent their kids to school
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:53.160]  without a mask what would the school do if all the parents walked in on the same day and said
[3:50:53.160 --> 3:50:58.680]  here's our here's a note that says we're withdrawing our kids from school what would the school do
[3:50:58.680 --> 3:51:04.760]  most likely there would be an emergency meeting and they'd revisit these laws but because no one is
[3:51:04.760 --> 3:51:11.880]  not because hardly any i mean most people are not saying no they're getting away with it and
[3:51:11.880 --> 3:51:17.320]  they're continuing to do with it i mean i spoke with a couple parents yesterday who are in a
[3:51:17.320 --> 3:51:21.400]  different state and i said so your child has to wear a mask eight hours a day and they're like yeah
[3:51:21.400 --> 3:51:26.840]  we don't know what else to do we have no choice and i'm like you do have a choice figure it out
[3:51:26.840 --> 3:51:33.000]  i think that's for your kids out whatever you can leila that is such a key thing that you
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:37.960]  have to look at the reality of this situation because there are no parents who are being
[3:51:37.960 --> 3:51:42.920]  you know held down with a gun pointed at their heads saying order your child to put a mask on
[3:51:42.920 --> 3:51:49.560]  right now it's always a choice and also you know you had mentioned that there are laws but there
[3:51:49.560 --> 3:51:57.880]  are actually no laws even requiring this what there are are you know policies executive orders
[3:51:57.880 --> 3:52:04.600]  mandates and those are not things that we have to follow as individual men and women and in fact
[3:52:05.240 --> 3:52:11.240]  these policies are actually breaking many many laws for example in new york state we have a
[3:52:11.240 --> 3:52:18.760]  specific criminal law called obstruction of breath and it's clear that when you force someone to
[3:52:18.760 --> 3:52:25.160]  wear a mask or coerce them to do so you're actually guilty of that crime and there are many many others
[3:52:25.160 --> 3:52:31.000]  because you know one other thing that we see rampant now and this doesn't just apply to school
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:38.920]  officials but we see all kinds of agencies giving out medical advice now it used to be that you had
[3:52:38.920 --> 3:52:44.840]  to be a licensed health care practitioner to provide medical advice but we see school districts
[3:52:44.840 --> 3:52:54.040]  right teachers principles politicians saying that this vaccine is you know safe and effective
[3:52:54.040 --> 3:53:00.200]  and recommending for people to take it right making treatment recommendations it's people
[3:53:00.200 --> 3:53:07.080]  have overstepped their boundaries and you know taken dominion away from individuals and we have
[3:53:07.080 --> 3:53:15.480]  to realize that we actually have the ability to do this so for my area you know i decided and
[3:53:15.480 --> 3:53:21.960]  fortunately my children's mother agreed that we would homes educate the children because they're
[3:53:21.960 --> 3:53:28.440]  what they were already in a private school which adopted i think they were more concerned about
[3:53:28.440 --> 3:53:34.760]  following the cdc recommendations than the public school system and they wouldn't even let me attend
[3:53:34.760 --> 3:53:41.000]  a meeting to discuss it without wearing a mask but what's happened is that the community has
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:48.120]  self-organized and we have now several groups we have a homeschool gym class we have homeschool
[3:53:48.120 --> 3:53:54.280]  art classes and we're expanding this and these are basically people self-organizing pooling our
[3:53:54.280 --> 3:54:01.480]  resources someone has something to teach and then you know it provides a way to get all the children
[3:54:01.480 --> 3:54:07.880]  together to socialize in a more normal setting so no matter where we are or what the situation right
[3:54:07.880 --> 3:54:14.600]  we can actually make our own decision and provide a good setting and education for our children isn't
[3:54:14.600 --> 3:54:21.880]  that right leila that's right why did we bring our children into this world if we're just going to
[3:54:21.880 --> 3:54:29.000]  pass them off and send them off into a building where they are being abused where their future
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:34.280]  is being ruined because of all the ptsd that they're going to have all the psychological damage
[3:54:34.280 --> 3:54:42.600]  that's happening by you know them being beaten into submission i mean you have to think about
[3:54:42.600 --> 3:54:48.360]  all these things do whatever it takes i mean if it means you know you have to sacrifice income
[3:54:48.360 --> 3:54:54.440]  whatever you need to do to save your child from this tyranny it's and and it starts with the mask
[3:54:54.440 --> 3:55:01.720]  what's next now it's the vaccines what's after the vaccines i mean look at communist china
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:07.480]  they start slowly and now i mean um i was just watching something yesterday where
[3:55:08.200 --> 3:55:15.480]  the kids are limited to how many hours they can be uh on a device the government is limiting people
[3:55:16.120 --> 3:55:21.720]  their own in their own homes how many hours they can be on a device so you start small and then it
[3:55:21.720 --> 3:55:26.280]  just spirals and spirals because they're like oh let's see what else we can get away with it
[3:55:26.280 --> 3:55:34.040]  i heard a lady in a school board meeting say parents do not have the right to to parent
[3:55:34.040 --> 3:55:40.600]  their children the way they want to parent their children well so the school is parenting our
[3:55:40.600 --> 3:55:47.160]  children it doesn't even make sense uh you may not even be aware that in some of the socialist
[3:55:47.160 --> 3:55:54.280]  european nations that people are not allowed to homeschool their children it's against the law
[3:55:54.280 --> 3:56:02.760]  they have to allow the state sanctioned strangers to educate their children so it in actuality right
[3:56:02.760 --> 3:56:10.520]  this movement is to take the parenting away from the parents and to have the state act as the parents
[3:56:10.520 --> 3:56:17.560]  and that legal philosophy is called parents patriae wow i've i have heard of that and it's
[3:56:17.560 --> 3:56:24.280]  heartbreaking i can imagine not being not being able to have the choice to pull my kids out of the
[3:56:24.280 --> 3:56:30.200]  system and create my own system because ultimately that's what we need to do here in america we need
[3:56:30.200 --> 3:56:37.640]  to create our own systems we need to create our own communities as long as the public schools
[3:56:37.640 --> 3:56:42.600]  and the other schools want to stay where they're at it's a lot easier to just say fine i'm going to
[3:56:42.600 --> 3:56:48.200]  create it myself whether it's a little pod whether it's just a few people whether it's your own school
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:55.240]  like i've done stop trying to fight the system and create our own system because we have the power
[3:56:55.240 --> 3:57:03.480]  to do that still in america that is just a fantastic message leila i knew you know as soon as i saw you
[3:57:03.480 --> 3:57:08.680]  speak uh we were at a conference together a few months ago i was so inspired because
[3:57:08.680 --> 3:57:14.440]  it's really one of the first and only positive messages that i've seen that if you have the
[3:57:14.440 --> 3:57:21.480]  courage to take matters into your own hands this is what you and i and all the other brothers and
[3:57:21.480 --> 3:57:29.160]  sisters out there can make happen we can make a good future for ourselves despite all of the
