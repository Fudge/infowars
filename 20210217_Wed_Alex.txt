[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  I don't play air raid sirens to scare you, I play air raid sirens because you're under
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  attack and you know what's going on, you understand this is a war.
[00:33.000 --> 00:34.680]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:34.680 --> 00:43.400]  I have a skeleton crew and we have limited power back on in the studios here and a lot
[00:43.400 --> 00:47.680]  of listeners will say to me, well you're Mr. Prepared, why aren't you Prepared, want to
[00:47.680 --> 00:49.400]  eat some of that swirable food.
[00:49.400 --> 00:52.960]  When I've told people that we should all take our vitamins and be in shape, I'm pointing
[00:52.960 --> 00:58.120]  three fingers back at myself and one finger at you but I'm obviously saying why I think
[00:58.120 --> 01:02.480]  the best thing to do is, the city of Austin was here two years ago and wouldn't give us
[01:02.480 --> 01:09.280]  the permits for a full power generator system that we wanted to put in here and you could
[01:09.280 --> 01:13.440]  I guess move locations, we don't have the money to do that so we're just like the average
[01:13.440 --> 01:18.640]  folks and I don't have power, most of my family doesn't have power and so I've been going
[01:18.640 --> 01:23.200]  around dealing with frozen pipes and things like that and I'm not complaining, I just
[01:23.200 --> 01:26.720]  saw some of the comments on Band-Aught Video and really what I'm doing here at the start
[01:26.720 --> 01:32.880]  of the broadcast is just doing a little bit of bitching because the information is so
[01:32.880 --> 01:40.400]  heavy, the information is so insanely intense that I'm going to be covering here today as
[01:40.400 --> 01:45.720]  I broadcast from a building that's 99% dark except for the studio and we've got three
[01:45.720 --> 01:51.920]  generators running just to keep this going 24 hours a day, I bring you this information
[01:51.920 --> 01:56.800]  because this is the end of the Republic, the end of the country, the end of the world as
[01:56.800 --> 02:02.640]  you know it, this is the global extermination plan and now they're so far into it, I'm able
[02:02.640 --> 02:08.960]  to track the type it is, I knew they had different models to first launch test attacks and then
[02:08.960 --> 02:13.280]  prepare and then a few years later launch bigger attacks each time killing more of us
[02:13.280 --> 02:19.400]  but they've decided to go ahead and just accelerate all the way now and I would say by a year
[02:19.400 --> 02:24.080]  from now they'll release a bio weapon that probably kills 4 million people so they may
[02:24.080 --> 02:30.080]  even have Biden stand down and receive a first strike to our military bases from China and
[02:30.080 --> 02:33.720]  I'm just telling you what I really think, okay so this is the ultimate black pill broadcast
[02:33.720 --> 02:38.520]  today and I just want you to understand what we're facing, now I already knew this and
[02:38.520 --> 02:44.400]  I said this on Monday, I have a short special report on my little globalist tracker slave
[02:44.400 --> 02:50.080]  made iPhone and the skeleton crew got it uploaded to our servers and systems that aren't in
[02:50.080 --> 02:54.720]  Texas and the blackouts was able to get out and I said watch this blackouts gonna last
[02:54.720 --> 03:00.480]  weeks, it's all a psychological test and now they've come out and announced it's gonna
[03:00.480 --> 03:06.320]  last weeks, that was just announced one hour ago, it's going to last for weeks, so there
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.800]  is the headline, Joe Biden's dark winter is here, U.S. now under agenda 2030, electrical
[03:11.800 --> 03:17.600]  lockdown and Bill Gates says that's good to have blackouts get used to it in North Korea,
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.040]  in Romania, under Chilchescu and other dictatorships that they do this on purpose, I helped write
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.280]  the excellent analysis that Greg Rees put out last week and I'm not taking credit, he
[03:28.280 --> 03:32.320]  wrote about 90% of it but there's the part in there about next they're gonna turn your
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.960]  power off and give you rolling blackouts and I predicted that would be imminent and of
[03:36.960 --> 03:42.000]  course it's now imminent and now it's here because I also noticed everything Q said
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.480]  was the enemy bragging, it was the enemy, the mouth of Sauron and so Q said when the
[03:48.480 --> 03:52.600]  lights go out that's when the roundups begin and indeed they are starting to swat team
[03:52.600 --> 03:55.800]  and pill and round people up, they're in the blackouts but it's us that's getting rounded
[03:55.800 --> 04:05.600]  up, not them so also that's some of the sick, sick irony of President Q, yep so there you
[04:05.600 --> 04:11.880]  go ladies and gentlemen this is a hellish situation, absolutely nightmare situation
[04:11.880 --> 04:17.440]  and I have not even begun to give you the intel when we come back, Biden openly last
[04:17.440 --> 04:23.400]  night on the communist news network said that GZP is good and that the takeover of Hong
[04:23.400 --> 04:29.920]  Kong is good and that the death camps are good, you're like this is incredible, yes
[04:29.920 --> 04:34.200]  I want to play the video next segment, this is the externalization of the completely satanic
[04:34.200 --> 04:44.960]  method and they got me, beta is over baby, beta is over so America has fallen, America
[04:44.960 --> 04:51.480]  is gone, America is dead and only admitting that gives us any chance of turning around,
[04:51.480 --> 04:56.040]  we are now completely overrun, the FBI has completely paid off and hell on earth is now
[04:56.040 --> 05:05.680]  being released, finally we're seeing major state governments in the United States running
[05:05.680 --> 05:12.680]  TV and radio ads saying everybody take your vitamin D3, take your zinc and take your C,
[05:12.680 --> 05:17.600]  it's essential for your body cells to maintain your health, essential means you must have

[06:35.960 --> 06:37.640]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:37.640 --> 06:46.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, February 17th, the year is 2021 and we're going to
[06:46.560 --> 06:53.160]  be here live for the next four hours, Lord willing, very thankful to the crew, some of
[06:53.160 --> 06:56.560]  them working around the clock, those are able to get out of their homes, those that didn't
[06:56.560 --> 07:02.040]  live in the hills, many people are completely locked in their homes because of half foot
[07:02.040 --> 07:08.440]  thick sheet of black ice, after this giant blue norther pound of the state and much of
[07:08.440 --> 07:12.880]  the rest of the country and more is on its way, again, thank you for joining us, I am
[07:12.880 --> 07:21.120]  Alex Jones, your host, let me just do the best job I can right now and just read you
[07:21.120 --> 07:29.360]  these headlines, Joe Biden officially endorses communist China and the invasion of Hong Kong,
[07:29.360 --> 07:35.120]  he officially endorses the Uyghurs in death camps working in slave factories for apple,
[07:35.120 --> 07:41.160]  so that is official, we have the video for you, this would be like Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[07:41.160 --> 07:48.160]  in 1943 saying Hitler is a good person, this is just over the top, super whopper and it's
[07:48.160 --> 07:53.240]  on purpose, so they were wondering where Joe Biden was going to behave because they own
[07:53.240 --> 07:58.160]  him and have him on the short airs, you now know totally controlled by Chinese intelligence,
[07:58.160 --> 08:07.320]  so is most the senate, not just the democrats but also Mitch McConnell, it's just unbelievable,
[08:07.320 --> 08:13.440]  so we have that, we also have an extremely chilling statement from Bill Gates and one
[08:13.440 --> 08:21.600]  from Saki, the White House press secretary, saying, oh, we hope someday the lockdowns
[08:21.600 --> 08:28.160]  and the mask end, so now it's, we hope someday, and they're now saying seven years, ten years,
[08:28.160 --> 08:33.040]  twenty years, it's completely over, contact tracers coming to your house soon, already
[08:33.040 --> 08:36.760]  coming to people's houses across Europe, Australia, and there actually is contact tracers now
[08:36.760 --> 08:43.040]  actually showing up with armed police at people's doors for their Facebook post about
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.760]  not wearing masks, in Florida, places like Broward County, they are now sending police
[08:48.760 --> 08:53.160]  in the middle of the night without warrants to your house to tell you that you better
[08:53.160 --> 08:58.720]  not organize a no mask protest, see the contact tracers are the political enforcers, remember
[08:58.720 --> 09:06.160]  Obama said we need a group just as big and just as strong as our military, remember
[09:06.160 --> 09:11.880]  that, we need a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military
[09:11.880 --> 09:15.240]  and it's called the Bill and the Gates Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative, they've
[09:15.240 --> 09:20.120]  divided it up and the UN three groups all have their own accredited training now for
[09:20.120 --> 09:27.720]  millions of the new enforcers that have the power to disappear you to a secret facility,
[09:27.720 --> 09:32.480]  and of course I told you they would use a deadly virus as the cover for this twenty
[09:32.480 --> 09:41.120]  years ago and it was even the plot fifteen, sixteen years ago to V for Vindetta, so they're
[09:41.120 --> 09:51.600]  thrilling it in your faces, so we have that and we have Mark Zuckerberg in a leaked video
[09:51.600 --> 09:57.920]  saying that he doesn't trust the vaccine because it mutates the DNA of the body which
[09:57.920 --> 10:01.880]  is what it does, it does cause mutations which you might know as another name, it's called
[10:01.880 --> 10:06.640]  cancer, it's not very much fun to get her to die, but why would he tell his insider
[10:06.640 --> 10:13.760]  executive class, well they all get the warning, I mean you don't actually take the vaccine
[10:13.760 --> 10:18.640]  do you, certainly not, and I'm going to explain something when we come back in the next segment,
[10:18.640 --> 10:27.040]  it's the most important thing ever, okay and it's this, everything with them is actually
[10:27.040 --> 10:31.360]  a truthful statement except it's inverted, so Bill Gates says we're fighting the equivalent
[10:31.360 --> 10:35.520]  of World War II, you have that clip coming up, we're fighting the equivalent of World
[10:35.520 --> 10:45.080]  War II and the virus is World War II and climate change is like World War II, when
[10:45.080 --> 10:50.520]  he says we're fighting the virus, you're the virus, they call human overpopulation and
[10:50.520 --> 10:57.320]  free speech and everything and Christians and white males the virus, so they say it's
[10:57.320 --> 11:03.000]  like a world war and suddenly he's on every channel constantly, Joe Biden isn't seen but
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.360]  about once a week, they say Joe Biden won't meet with a world leader for two months and
[11:07.360 --> 11:11.640]  they're teaching us that Bill Gates does the talking along with Kamala Harris and now it's
[11:11.640 --> 11:16.640]  in the news that Bill Gates talks to world leaders now for Joe Biden and he talks for
[11:16.640 --> 11:24.400]  the president of France, he speaks for him and he speaks for the prime minister of England,
[11:24.400 --> 11:32.760]  a month ago the prime minister said we have the rotating G8 seat in 2021 and that Bill
[11:32.760 --> 11:38.200]  Gates will run that for him and that Bill Gates is really the head of the G8, Boris
[11:38.200 --> 11:44.040]  Johnson, Bill Gates is really the head of the G8 and they're getting used to technocracy
[11:44.040 --> 11:51.040]  where Bloomberg's and Gates's of the world, they are your leader and then presidents and
[11:51.040 --> 11:59.880]  prime ministers step back and the Jeff Bezos and the Bill Gates has actually ruled over
[11:59.880 --> 12:04.400]  all of us and tell us about our medical future and tell us about the economy and tell us
[12:04.400 --> 12:13.760]  about our energy use, in fact here's an article, here's an article from a couple years ago
[12:13.760 --> 12:19.760]  and it says backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos breakthrough energy ventures place bets
[12:19.760 --> 12:36.920]  on power outages, power outages, they place their bets on there being big power problems
[12:36.920 --> 12:40.360]  and so that they're going to have ways to quote store it and then look Texas wholesale
[12:40.360 --> 12:49.400]  electric prices spike more than 10,000% amid outages oh and here's the big news, they planned
[12:49.400 --> 12:54.520]  this power outage, they did it on purpose and I even have articles where they have admitted
[12:54.520 --> 12:59.720]  this in the past, remember Enron, I'm going to break all that down to each one of these
[12:59.720 --> 13:04.200]  big topics and Bill Gates coming out and saying you're not going to have me anymore
[13:04.200 --> 13:11.720]  and world governments here and I'm in control of your life and Mark Zuckerberg video saying
[13:11.720 --> 13:16.760]  oh yeah and I don't trust this vaccine, it's not really a vaccine, it changes the RNA and
[13:16.760 --> 13:25.520]  the DNA and then we've got the big one is Biden just saying GZPing is doing a wonderful
[13:25.520 --> 13:33.480]  job, now what Enron did was create the rolling blockouts to create the artificial scarcity
[13:33.480 --> 13:39.640]  perception where they would overcharge billions a day sometimes to people on the west coast
[13:39.640 --> 13:45.200]  with leisure, they had fake computer models and fake computer reporting to the state and
[13:45.200 --> 13:49.240]  it was all fraud, the state knew it was and see they just burned Enron and Ken Lay back
[13:49.240 --> 13:52.920]  then because there was still a little bit of an FBI, a little bit of the court system
[13:52.920 --> 13:58.400]  and just you know you can't plus Enron was kind of its own company, oh no that doesn't
[13:58.400 --> 14:03.320]  just belong to you, we're going to take that technology and total energy fraud and roll
[14:03.320 --> 14:09.240]  that because it was Enron came up with the carbon tax in 1987, I mean you knew that right,
[14:09.240 --> 14:17.200]  Ken Lay hatched all this and then we all heard he committed suicide on house arrest and then
[14:17.200 --> 14:23.920]  or does he's down in Paraguay, so that's how all this works ladies and gentlemen, I study
[14:23.920 --> 14:30.280]  how these boys operate, how they do it and Schwarzenegger got together with Enron and
[14:30.280 --> 14:34.520]  cooked all that up and then recalled the Democrat governor remember, well who I wasn't
[14:34.520 --> 14:37.920]  for either but then they made it even worse and then old Swartz he ripped everybody off
[14:37.920 --> 14:44.440]  and continued the scam going and that's how it operates and of course folks are worried
[14:44.440 --> 14:48.800]  that China is taking control of the U.S. electric grid but big deal, I mean they're good folks,
[14:48.800 --> 14:53.440]  it's their cultural norm to have 3 million Muslims in death camps, a million Christians
[14:53.440 --> 14:57.600]  and a million Buddhists, I mean there's at least 5 million people in death camps, death
[14:57.600 --> 15:03.200]  camps and they, one camp estimate till about 5,000 a day and we've showed you the footage
[15:03.200 --> 15:08.040]  of the mass executions, the stations complain about it, I understand it, mass executions
[15:08.040 --> 15:13.200]  aren't fun but you know when George Floyd was killed everybody showed it so we could
[15:13.200 --> 15:18.160]  burn the country down over what one cop did wrong, so it's okay to show that snuff film
[15:18.160 --> 15:23.680]  right, you just don't want to show those death camps in China, those mass executions and
[15:23.680 --> 15:28.040]  then walking up and just machine gunning people are hanging them, no you're not supposed
[15:28.040 --> 15:35.000]  to, oh come on have some decency Jones, let's not show that, so only having a full total
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.600]  awakening that you're under attack, it's a sadness, I mean it's every ounce of courage
[15:41.600 --> 15:47.560]  I have not to evacuate the United States right now, I mean it's that bad and by the way it's
[15:47.560 --> 15:50.680]  totally easy to do, you just have to make the decision but that's what courage is, it just
[15:50.680 --> 15:54.560]  continually being replaced every millisecond but you better have courage because if you
[15:54.560 --> 15:58.760]  don't stand up, they're going to kill all of us very soon, we'll be right back, stay
[15:58.760 --> 15:59.760]  with us.

[16:13.720 --> 16:18.240]  the difference between life and death, you probably already believe that, I certainly
[16:18.240 --> 16:23.120]  do, so here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based

[18:11.440 --> 18:17.000]  image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will, being
[18:17.000 --> 18:23.040]  given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[18:23.040 --> 18:27.720]  an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're
[18:27.720 --> 18:32.240]  able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty
[18:32.240 --> 18:36.560]  of your wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[18:36.560 --> 18:41.720]  of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and
[18:41.720 --> 18:47.720]  that itself is what God teaches us is worship, so don't worship the globalist, don't worship
[18:47.720 --> 18:52.680]  the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God because
[18:52.680 --> 18:58.000]  we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate pre-speech while you still have
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.760]  it, while you still have it.
[19:00.760 --> 19:06.200]  My enemies are your enemies, they're the globalists, they're the extremists, they're
[19:06.200 --> 19:11.560]  consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles, control for each devil, worshipers, vampires,
[19:11.560 --> 19:17.280]  wherever you want to call them, that are highly predatory, that are setting up a false
[19:17.280 --> 19:23.560]  famously land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs and electromagnetic
[19:23.560 --> 19:30.920]  radiation to change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they
[19:30.920 --> 19:36.520]  can control like a pawn on a chess board, the bottom line is they want to play God,
[19:36.520 --> 19:41.120]  they are playing God and the news is only going to tie it around our necks from here
[19:41.120 --> 19:46.280]  on out, so many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news and want to
[19:46.280 --> 19:50.000]  only cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order, but at the end of the
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.400]  day it's all about depopulation, it's all about world government, it's all about the
[19:53.400 --> 19:57.920]  end of the human system as we know it, it's actually the nightmare being built, only
[19:57.920 --> 20:06.200]  admitting it can turn around and stop it, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:27.920 --> 20:35.680]  There's two types of civilizations, those based on barbarism and torture and evil
[20:35.680 --> 20:47.280]  and intrigue, backstabbing, feudalism, serfdom, and then there's those based on goodness
[20:47.280 --> 20:53.080]  and chivalry and strength, where people get together and decide to try to build a strong
[20:53.080 --> 20:57.400]  virtuous system because they don't want their children to be slaves and they want to have
[20:57.400 --> 21:06.800]  their security and they want to build a beautiful system, but man is fallen and as soon as you
[21:06.800 --> 21:13.800]  don't recognize that, as soon as you don't fight corruption, it takes over like cancer.
[21:13.800 --> 21:21.280]  And so I've been on air 27 years and as you know, if you're a regular listener, I probably
[21:21.280 --> 21:25.600]  didn't say this is the most important broadcast I've ever done for five years, about five
[21:25.600 --> 21:29.160]  years into my broadcasting career and research career, I've started to say this is the most
[21:29.160 --> 21:33.080]  important thing I've ever done and maybe I've said that every couple of years and then
[21:33.080 --> 21:36.000]  I've said every couple of months and now I say it every week because things just get
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.240]  more intense.
[21:39.240 --> 21:49.320]  To have Joe Biden come out in a town hall on CNN standing 20 feet away from Anderson
[21:49.320 --> 21:57.920]  Cooper, the Aster air, the eugenics air, Aster's heavily funded Bill Gates, the population plan,
[21:57.920 --> 22:00.160]  he's the heir to the entire fortune.
[22:00.160 --> 22:03.920]  Oh, but he owns nothing like Bill Gates.
[22:03.920 --> 22:05.600]  He just puts it all in his install tax free.
[22:05.600 --> 22:06.600]  He's such a philanthropist.
[22:06.600 --> 22:09.840]  Oh, and he's gay too, so it's okay.
[22:09.840 --> 22:14.240]  You know, if he supports death camps in China, as long as you're gay and look like Anderson
[22:14.240 --> 22:22.680]  Cooper, Tim Cook, it's okay because they're good people because they're gay, but anyways,
[22:22.680 --> 22:26.720]  because they're not having any children, that's the really important part, isn't it?
[22:26.720 --> 22:33.880]  And there they are and he says that China's doing a good thing in Hong Kong.
[22:33.880 --> 22:40.560]  We have a treaty with Hong Kong, the British do, protectorate agreement.
[22:40.560 --> 22:43.920]  China has an agreement with them to not do what they're doing, to not take over for another
[22:43.920 --> 22:49.600]  20 years, but they've got trips by the hundreds of thousands stationed there.
[22:49.600 --> 22:52.680]  They're attacking people, torturing them, killing them.
[22:52.680 --> 22:59.280]  And Joe Biden says that's good in total violation of US policy, US law, common sense.
[22:59.280 --> 23:03.040]  He just says it right out loud.
[23:03.040 --> 23:04.040]  And then he went further.
[23:04.040 --> 23:07.280]  He said, oh, he didn't deny they were killing the Uyghurs.
[23:07.280 --> 23:14.720]  He didn't deny there were 3 million of them in death camps that make components mainly
[23:14.720 --> 23:18.920]  for Apple.
[23:18.920 --> 23:19.920]  That's all on record.
[23:19.920 --> 23:24.760]  Apple doesn't deny that.
[23:24.760 --> 23:36.360]  And all the videos come out of the...
[23:36.360 --> 23:46.400]  So we have reached this incredible point where you notice all these Democrat leaders, one
[23:46.400 --> 23:50.320]  of the Democrat party leaders in California, remember two weeks ago said, we need to be
[23:50.320 --> 23:53.800]  like Gigi Peng and put Americans in camps like the Uyghurs.
[23:53.800 --> 23:56.680]  And people went, man, you even name it.
[23:56.680 --> 23:59.120]  It's like they're endorsing it.
[23:59.120 --> 24:01.560]  And they're on the news saying we want to arrest Americans.
[24:01.560 --> 24:04.800]  We want to put Americans in camps.
[24:04.800 --> 24:14.880]  We are the new single party like the Communist Party, 1949, that took over China.
[24:14.880 --> 24:25.160]  And it's just completely and totally and absolutely out in the open.
[24:25.160 --> 24:28.320]  They have killed more than 30 million.
[24:28.320 --> 24:30.480]  The Chinese party says, baby's already born.
[24:30.480 --> 24:36.320]  They've had a one-child policy to where there's probably 100 million more boys in China than
[24:36.320 --> 24:37.320]  there are girls.
[24:37.320 --> 24:42.040]  So they export Chinese men to colonies and tell them get an African wife, get a Latin
[24:42.040 --> 24:45.200]  American wife, get an American wife.
[24:45.200 --> 24:51.480]  They forcibly rape the Uyghur women and up to 10 men at a time.
[24:51.480 --> 24:52.480]  That's in mainstream news.
[24:52.480 --> 24:53.480]  They don't deny it.
[24:53.480 --> 25:04.560]  To forcibly make them Chinese instead of the group they are, which basically is Chinese.
[25:04.560 --> 25:17.520]  It's a dark day, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:17.520 --> 25:19.000]  It's a dark day.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.720]  I'm going to play this clip in a moment, but this is all being done on purpose.
[25:22.720 --> 25:27.280]  This is rubbing our faces in it, and we got another bad piece of news.
[25:27.280 --> 25:28.280]  He wasn't perfect.
[25:28.280 --> 25:33.800]  He got snuckered into wars, loveless wars, but he wasn't American, and he was at Loyal
[25:33.800 --> 25:34.800]  of the Country.
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.520]  He meant well, and he fought the Communist, Rush Limbaugh.
[25:39.520 --> 25:41.720]  American radio host dead at 70.
[25:41.720 --> 25:48.880]  So just another disgusting, sickening omen.
[25:48.880 --> 25:53.320]  And folks, I've learned at 47 to go, oh, my God, it's never wrong.
[25:53.320 --> 25:59.200]  The United States is facing imminent destruction.
[25:59.200 --> 26:04.400]  My gut's never been wrong, and I keep having very intense nightmares the last month, but
[26:04.400 --> 26:07.960]  the United States is going to be hit by nuclear weapons by China, and it's going to stand
[26:07.960 --> 26:12.480]  down, and it's going to receive the attack.
[26:12.480 --> 26:13.720]  And I've looked at all the evidence, too.
[26:13.720 --> 26:18.800]  They're preparing us with staying in your homes, oh, your power's off, but they turned
[26:18.800 --> 26:19.800]  the power off.
[26:19.800 --> 26:20.800]  I'll prove that coming up.
[26:20.800 --> 26:24.960]  But they admitted, by the way, it's in the fine print, and they're just getting us ready
[26:24.960 --> 26:25.960]  for the disaster.
[26:25.960 --> 26:26.960]  They're not going to hit the main cities.
[26:26.960 --> 26:32.640]  They're going to hit the military bases, and that's why they want to keep National Guard
[26:32.640 --> 26:39.200]  in D.C. so that the states can't organize and have a response, they'll be cut off in
[26:39.200 --> 26:40.200]  D.C.
[26:40.200 --> 26:43.920]  That's why they're doing this purge the military that it is 60 days stand down to go through
[26:43.920 --> 26:48.040]  and create lists of who they're going to kill right away and who they're not.
[26:48.040 --> 26:53.520]  I mean, if you don't want to stay and fight this, I would evacuate the United States right
[26:53.520 --> 26:55.020]  now.
[26:55.020 --> 26:59.080]  Very good chance that they're going to either blow the entire power grid with the MPs, which
[26:59.080 --> 27:01.520]  they've been conditioning us to get ready for, or they're going to hit us with a first
[27:01.520 --> 27:03.960]  strike, and you're like, oh, that's crazy.
[27:03.960 --> 27:06.080]  Now, this is war, folks.
[27:06.080 --> 27:07.080]  America's over.
[27:07.080 --> 27:08.080]  It's gone.
[27:08.080 --> 27:09.080]  Trump was removed.
[27:09.080 --> 27:10.320]  Of course, he won in a giant landslide.
[27:10.320 --> 27:12.440]  They weren't going to allow that to happen.
[27:12.440 --> 27:16.600]  And that's why when you look at the press secretary and all the Biden's people, they are scared.
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.520]  If I was them, I'd be scared too because they're going to be removed as soon as the Chinese
[27:20.520 --> 27:21.520]  take over.
[27:21.520 --> 27:24.040]  So I just I've got to be honest with you, folks.
[27:24.040 --> 27:25.040]  It's all over.
[27:25.040 --> 27:26.040]  Okay.
[27:26.040 --> 27:27.040]  It's all over.
[27:27.040 --> 27:28.040]  We're about to be hit with nuclear weapons.
[27:28.040 --> 27:29.040]  The military stood down.
[27:29.040 --> 27:30.040]  Everything's going.
[27:30.040 --> 27:31.040]  So I'm sorry.
[27:31.040 --> 27:32.040]  It's over.
[27:32.040 --> 27:33.040]  Cut is gone.
[27:33.040 --> 27:34.040]  It's all over.
[27:34.040 --> 27:35.040]  I mean, I'm not giving up.
[27:35.040 --> 27:37.640]  I'm admitting that the death star is orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.
[27:37.640 --> 27:40.840]  If we don't stop the globalist, if they aren't stopped, it's over.
[27:40.840 --> 27:42.440]  You think they just steal elections for no reason?
[27:42.440 --> 27:44.960]  You think they're saying veterans are terrorists for no reason?
[27:44.960 --> 27:48.040]  It's interesting, all white men are terrorists.
[27:48.040 --> 27:52.520]  Under this Chinese regime, folks, they're going to take all white men in for reeducation.
[27:52.520 --> 27:57.080]  And then it'll be every other group after that because they know that white men coming
[27:57.080 --> 28:02.760]  from a Scottish, Irish, English tradition, even the continent of Europe, Europe didn't
[28:02.760 --> 28:04.320]  get free about 150 years ago.
[28:04.320 --> 28:09.360]  Germans were still surfs 150 years ago, slaves in the Austrian Hungarian Empire.
[28:09.360 --> 28:11.640]  They were under a king.
[28:11.640 --> 28:17.600]  British services, oppressions were owned, men, passions were sold as mercenaries.
[28:17.600 --> 28:24.280]  So you had a bunch of wars in the British Isles over tribalism and who ran things.
[28:24.280 --> 28:26.760]  And then that grew into our system of freedom.
[28:26.760 --> 28:28.480]  That's where it all came from, folks.
[28:28.480 --> 28:29.560]  It all comes out of England.
[28:29.560 --> 28:30.560]  It all comes out of Scotland.
[28:30.560 --> 28:31.960]  It all comes out of Ireland.
[28:31.960 --> 28:35.420]  That's where all the freedom comes from, mainly England.
[28:35.420 --> 28:39.360]  People demanding their freedom because they were going to have another group dominating
[28:39.360 --> 28:40.360]  them.
[28:40.360 --> 28:41.680]  They weren't even telling me what to do.
[28:41.680 --> 28:43.960]  The Scots are going to have the English telling them what to do.
[28:43.960 --> 28:44.960]  The Brits, the British.
[28:44.960 --> 28:49.120]  The Irish aren't going to have the English telling them what to do.
[28:49.120 --> 28:53.880]  That's where all this comes from and it's all just been washed away.
[28:53.880 --> 28:59.640]  All of it, so just admit it.
[28:59.640 --> 29:05.320]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and
[29:05.320 --> 29:10.360]  pull horses head if you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[29:10.360 --> 29:16.960]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really up in their game and they are trying
[29:16.960 --> 29:19.720]  to destroy all independent forms of media.
[29:19.720 --> 29:22.680]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[29:22.680 --> 29:28.160]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate,
[29:28.160 --> 29:31.440]  everything you warned your friends and family about has to be true.
[29:31.440 --> 29:34.200]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[29:34.200 --> 29:39.520]  The power structure should have silenced those of us that they can, but it's up to all of
[29:39.520 --> 29:43.200]  us to not let them silence any of us.
[29:43.200 --> 29:49.240]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[29:49.240 --> 29:54.320]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't
[29:54.320 --> 29:55.320]  come.
[29:55.320 --> 30:00.320]  So be the polar bearer as you are.
[30:00.320 --> 30:06.920]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government, but world government
[30:06.920 --> 30:09.320]  is only the control grid.
[30:09.320 --> 30:15.240]  Now, intermembers of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[30:15.240 --> 30:20.800]  and attain immortality, but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[30:20.800 --> 30:23.920]  of all carbon-based line forms.
[30:23.920 --> 30:26.040]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[30:26.040 --> 30:29.760]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[30:29.760 --> 30:31.640]  They are playing God.
[30:31.640 --> 30:38.400]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[30:38.400 --> 30:41.400]  to carry out this transformation.
[30:41.400 --> 30:45.840]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on
[30:45.840 --> 30:46.840]  record.
[30:46.840 --> 30:49.280]  You have been warned.
[30:49.280 --> 30:53.760]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[30:53.760 --> 30:57.400]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[30:57.400 --> 31:00.560]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[31:00.560 --> 31:04.440]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[31:04.440 --> 31:09.400]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought
[31:09.400 --> 31:11.120]  down to nothing.
[31:11.120 --> 31:16.200]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[31:16.200 --> 31:19.120]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[31:19.120 --> 31:26.320]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[31:26.320 --> 31:29.120]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[31:29.120 --> 31:31.440]  The enemy can't help itself.
[31:31.440 --> 31:35.480]  The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy.
[31:35.480 --> 31:41.120]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it, we should, but once
[31:41.120 --> 31:46.640]  it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[31:46.640 --> 31:50.960]  us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[31:50.960 --> 31:53.160]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[31:53.160 --> 31:56.800]  You're going under judgment just like all the children that were aborted.
[31:56.800 --> 31:58.440]  This is the truth.
[31:58.440 --> 32:00.280]  This is the InfoWars.
[32:00.280 --> 32:05.320]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[32:05.320 --> 32:07.680]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[32:07.680 --> 32:13.040]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though
[32:13.040 --> 32:17.680]  it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and
[32:17.680 --> 32:19.160]  euphoric effects.
[32:19.160 --> 32:24.520]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[32:24.520 --> 32:29.280]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[32:29.280 --> 32:33.960]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[32:33.960 --> 32:35.160]  loosen up a little.
[32:35.160 --> 32:40.080]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[32:40.080 --> 32:46.080]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[32:46.080 --> 32:48.680]  herbs including, but not limited to.
[32:48.680 --> 32:52.800]  German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balarian Roots.
[32:52.800 --> 33:03.560]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[33:03.560 --> 33:29.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:29.560 --> 33:35.000]  I'm guessing when it comes to this, they are strongly considering the decapitation of the
[33:35.000 --> 33:36.000]  United States.
[33:36.000 --> 33:45.000]  You're like, oh, the military won't let that happen, the military is compartmentalized.
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.580]  This country is run by the technocrats now, and they're telling us Bill Gates is the president
[33:49.580 --> 33:51.080]  of the world.
[33:51.080 --> 33:55.240]  Klaus Schwab is the administrator of the United Nations.
[33:55.240 --> 34:00.080]  They have the entire Fortune 500 lockstep.
[34:00.080 --> 34:01.920]  They are shutting the world economy down.
[34:01.920 --> 34:03.560]  They are imploding the third world.
[34:03.560 --> 34:09.920]  They're creating a migrant crisis out of which they will bring in total world government.
[34:09.920 --> 34:16.200]  The mRNA vaccine that Zuckerberg told his employees do not take will cause autoimmune
[34:16.200 --> 34:25.040]  disease, bare minimum, bare minimum, and miscarriages in women to take it, and destruction of the
[34:25.040 --> 34:27.440]  placenta.
[34:27.440 --> 34:30.960]  And I just told you, if you're a new listener and you think I'm joking, or maybe you're
[34:30.960 --> 34:33.800]  a new listener, you think it's good, like, oh, yeah, we love G.G.
[34:33.800 --> 34:36.000]  Ping.
[34:36.000 --> 34:48.160]  I have a longtime producer here, the oldest employee here, 17 years, used to live in Minnesota.
[34:48.160 --> 34:50.680]  His sister pledged allegiance to G.G.
[34:50.680 --> 34:57.560]  Ping, and is an academic, and she's main line in Minnesota.
[34:57.560 --> 35:00.720]  They pledged allegiance to G.G.
[35:00.720 --> 35:01.720]  Ping.
[35:01.720 --> 35:03.320]  Think I'm joking?
[35:03.320 --> 35:05.520]  Look at the Washington Post.
[35:05.520 --> 35:06.520]  Can G.G.
[35:06.520 --> 35:11.560]  Ping destroy Donald Trump to save America?
[35:11.560 --> 35:12.560]  Wow.
[35:12.560 --> 35:15.720]  Let me give you a little news flash.
[35:15.720 --> 35:23.720]  And Jeff Bezos' newspaper is telling you that we need the communist dictator that runs a
[35:23.720 --> 35:28.960]  country that's killed three or four times what Hitler did, that we need to be like them.
[35:28.960 --> 35:36.360]  We got a problem, Houston.
[35:36.360 --> 35:42.400]  So here he is saying, Hong Kong, green light invaded, totally taken over, which they've
[35:42.400 --> 35:45.880]  already basically done.
[35:45.880 --> 35:49.600]  And then it gets worse over here.
[35:49.600 --> 35:57.960]  Just hear it from Joe Biden with the CIA operative, Anderson Cooper, heir to the third-richest
[35:57.960 --> 36:01.840]  family from the Robert Barrett's, the Astros.
[36:01.840 --> 36:06.480]  Again, I want you to know these people all are, they're all intermarried.
[36:06.480 --> 36:08.120]  Gates is related to the Astros.
[36:08.120 --> 36:10.040]  It's all one group.
[36:10.040 --> 36:15.960]  And what crazy is, is it is weird, crazy white people.
[36:15.960 --> 36:17.200]  But they're not like Hitler.
[36:17.200 --> 36:22.680]  They want to kill all the poor people, and a lot of them are Jewish at the top of it.
[36:22.680 --> 36:26.240]  It's very, very sick, very, very sick, and you notice they're locking up all the Jews
[36:26.240 --> 36:32.960]  in Israel and arresting the Orthodox Jews in mass because they won't take the vaccines.
[36:32.960 --> 36:37.320]  I mean, they're going to come after everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:37.320 --> 36:38.320]  This is the cult.
[36:38.320 --> 36:41.720]  I met a film 14 years ago about Bill Gates called In Game.
[36:41.720 --> 36:44.440]  People used to say, why are you obsessed with a Microsoft nerd?
[36:44.440 --> 36:47.760]  I'm like, he runs the show.
[36:47.760 --> 36:55.040]  There's people behind him, but these globalists die.
[36:55.040 --> 36:59.280]  And Bill Gates is willing to be the front man, and he was hired to do this, and he's
[36:59.280 --> 37:00.640]  out there doing it.
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.600]  And he doesn't even contain himself when he's like, sorry, we're never going to reopen.
[37:05.600 --> 37:06.600]  Humans are a virus.
[37:06.600 --> 37:07.600]  Old people are a virus.
[37:07.600 --> 37:08.600]  That kills everybody.
[37:08.600 --> 37:14.760]  But, oh, his dad, he kept him alive forever, because they're important.
[37:14.760 --> 37:16.040]  They get to have jet airplanes.
[37:16.040 --> 37:17.760]  They get to have stakes.
[37:17.760 --> 37:21.240]  They get to have a bunch of children, and then his evil little daughter is now becoming
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.720]  a medical doctor, and she's wearing a yellow, excuse me, a pink sweater just like daddy.
[37:26.720 --> 37:31.680]  It's all PR firms, and she's making jokes about you conspiracy theorists claiming that,
[37:31.680 --> 37:34.800]  oh, they're going to put microchips in the vaccine.
[37:34.800 --> 37:37.360]  He has fricking patents on it.
[37:37.360 --> 37:41.040]  They're just not doing it with this one.
[37:41.040 --> 37:42.360]  So they always apple and orange it.
[37:42.360 --> 37:43.640]  And then people are like, read more.
[37:43.640 --> 37:53.040]  He has all these patents on delivering vaccines through mosquitoes.
[37:53.040 --> 37:55.280]  So these are very dangerous people.
[37:55.280 --> 37:58.880]  They tried to recruit my dad.
[37:58.880 --> 38:04.840]  Oh, my dad just fit the exact type they were looking for.
[38:04.840 --> 38:10.400]  Let me tell you.
[38:10.400 --> 38:11.400]  You know, there's types.
[38:11.400 --> 38:16.360]  You can look at somebody and tell they've been a marine or an army officer.
[38:16.360 --> 38:26.600]  You can tell somebody, they look at, but these globalists are short, nice, friendly little
[38:26.600 --> 38:31.160]  doctors, usually with, for whatever reason, dark hair.
[38:31.160 --> 38:32.160]  That's what my dad looks like.
[38:32.160 --> 38:36.200]  And he's on top of his class, and they tried to recruit him.
[38:36.200 --> 38:41.360]  My dad didn't tell me that till, again, my mother was watching in, gave him my office
[38:41.360 --> 38:42.360]  before it came out.
[38:42.360 --> 38:44.840]  And she looked at my dad and said, David, this can't be true.
[38:44.840 --> 38:48.760]  And he said, no, they recruited me at UT, planned to, gave me this whole speech, world
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.960]  government eugenics, call off the herd, you know, this is what happens, folks.
[38:53.960 --> 38:57.880]  My dad was in high school at the University of Texas being told about world government
[38:57.880 --> 39:00.440]  and depopulating the population.
[39:00.440 --> 39:04.720]  So, see, that's how far down the rat hole we are.
[39:04.720 --> 39:10.440]  And we just sit here and take it.
[39:10.440 --> 39:12.080]  And maybe Bill Gates is right.
[39:12.080 --> 39:14.920]  You deserve to die because you're putting up with it.
[39:14.920 --> 39:20.880]  I just want everybody to know that that's going along with this, that they are insane.
[39:20.880 --> 39:25.160]  I mean, I guarantee you that White House Press Secretary, she's destroying her children's
[39:25.160 --> 39:26.960]  future.
[39:26.960 --> 39:31.600]  All these people sign on and say, we've got to get rid of evil Western culture for peace
[39:31.600 --> 39:34.240]  and global government to stop problems.
[39:34.240 --> 39:39.800]  We've got to merge with China to have peace, but it isn't peace they're setting up.
[39:39.800 --> 39:41.440]  It's hell on earth.
[39:41.440 --> 39:45.600]  Okay, here, since I keep talking about it, is the most incredible thing ever.
[39:45.600 --> 39:51.600]  And you just know it's going to get worse from here on out.
[39:51.600 --> 39:58.440]  Here, ladies and gentlemen, is Joe Biden endorsing Communist China's death camps and takeover
[39:58.440 --> 40:00.480]  militarily of Hong Kong.
[40:00.480 --> 40:07.240]  Just unbelievable in your face, treason over the top, it's only going to get crazier from
[40:07.240 --> 40:08.240]  here.
[40:08.240 --> 40:09.320]  Here it is.
[40:09.320 --> 40:14.240]  You know, Chinese leaders, if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been
[40:14.240 --> 40:19.880]  the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven't been
[40:19.880 --> 40:21.680]  unified at home.
[40:21.680 --> 40:28.840]  So the central pro to vastly overstated the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there
[40:28.840 --> 40:32.560]  must be a united, tightly controlled China.
[40:32.560 --> 40:36.400]  And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.
[40:36.400 --> 40:41.080]  I point out to him, no American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn't
[40:41.080 --> 40:43.600]  reflect the values in the United States.
[40:43.600 --> 40:49.160]  And so the idea I'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what
[40:49.160 --> 40:56.560]  he's doing with the Uyghurs in Western mountains of China and Taiwan trying to end the one
[40:56.560 --> 41:04.280]  China policy by making it forceful, I said, and by the he said he he gets it culturally.
[41:04.280 --> 41:09.920]  There are different norms at each country and they their leaders are expected to follow.
[41:09.920 --> 41:14.880]  You catch that he said, he said, I'm not going to criticize it like he was saying he would
[41:14.880 --> 41:21.000]  criticize it, sick, evil lawyer crap.
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.640]  Now who else recently, oh, the Prime Minister of Canada said to a group of women who got
[41:26.640 --> 41:30.400]  really excited when he said it, it was so manly.
[41:30.400 --> 41:36.120]  He said, I like the Communist Chinese system of total dictatorship.
[41:36.120 --> 41:39.800]  And I like Xi Jinping, I like total dictatorship.
[41:39.800 --> 41:45.920]  And the women just all were like squirming in their seats and just wiggling around like
[41:45.920 --> 41:51.280]  they were at a, you know, men's or woman's gentleman club, what do you call those LaBear
[41:51.280 --> 41:54.160]  the guys with the bow ties, but that's all they're wearing.
[41:54.160 --> 41:59.680]  I mean, they were just giggling and snickering and hopping up and down.
[41:59.680 --> 42:05.040]  It's so sexy to have death camps, so sexy to have rivers that catch on fire.
[42:05.040 --> 42:07.720]  She's dumped the toxic waste right and it's so sexy.
[42:07.720 --> 42:11.280]  People that work 18 hours a day and they chain their kid up to a power pole and the child
[42:11.280 --> 42:14.800]  defecates on the side of the road and gets one meal a day and they're lucky.
[42:14.800 --> 42:17.960]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[42:17.960 --> 42:21.360]  And George Soros says China will lead us into the world government.
[42:21.360 --> 42:26.760]  And four years ago at Davos, Xi Jinping came and said, I will crush Trump and I will crush
[42:26.760 --> 42:28.160]  America.
[42:28.160 --> 42:35.440]  And Jean-Claude Yunker, the heir of the Supreme Nazi Order said, you will, we will crush them
[42:35.440 --> 42:40.320]  with economic war and economic weapons.
[42:40.320 --> 42:48.680]  And they are crushing us and we love it because we're Americans and we got the NFL and we're
[42:48.680 --> 42:51.480]  free and nobody can do anything to us.
[42:51.480 --> 42:59.600]  But oh, Gigi's choice, destroy Trump or save him or weaken America.
[42:59.600 --> 43:02.720]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[43:02.720 --> 43:08.080]  Because they work, they're real, they're powerful and because it's a giant market.
[43:08.080 --> 43:10.720]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[43:10.720 --> 43:12.220]  Because it works.
[43:12.220 --> 43:14.160]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[43:14.160 --> 43:22.320]  So whether it's saw palm meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostaguard
[43:22.320 --> 43:27.600]  or whether it is the super high grade organic bottom of the B12 and ultra 12 or whether
[43:27.600 --> 43:34.720]  it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force or the pure deep breath crystal iodine X2, these
[43:34.720 --> 43:41.480]  are all the very best supplements you're going to find in already great market of high quality
[43:41.480 --> 43:42.480]  products out there.

[43:56.640 --> 43:57.640]  InfoWareStore.com.
[43:57.640 --> 44:08.480]  In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.760]  Even before I had an access to the show in the mid-1990s, I wouldn't stall that movie
[44:12.760 --> 44:14.320]  and thought, man, that looks fun.
[44:14.320 --> 44:18.880]  In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[44:18.880 --> 44:19.880]  because you're real.
[44:19.880 --> 44:21.880]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[44:21.880 --> 44:22.880]  We're not worthy.
[44:22.880 --> 44:23.880]  We're not worthy.
[44:23.880 --> 44:29.880]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because
[44:29.880 --> 44:33.040]  these topics are so huge or so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[44:33.040 --> 44:34.040]  I'm trying to get it right.
[44:34.040 --> 44:35.200]  And most of the time we do.
[44:35.200 --> 44:36.840]  The globalists love lying to you.
[44:36.840 --> 44:38.200]  They love manipulating you.
[44:38.200 --> 44:40.840]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[44:40.840 --> 44:45.600]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[44:45.600 --> 44:48.200]  That for me is really set down and disgusting.
[44:48.200 --> 44:53.880]  So you've got to pledge for myself and all of them for the worst crew that we will never
[44:53.880 --> 44:54.880]  join the globalists.
[44:54.880 --> 45:00.640]  We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[45:00.640 --> 45:02.720]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[45:02.720 --> 45:09.080]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[45:09.080 --> 45:11.920]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[45:11.920 --> 45:16.360]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[45:16.360 --> 45:19.480]  And I understand why people learn to believe that because this is scary what's going on.
[45:19.480 --> 45:21.760]  The global government and the New World Order.
[45:21.760 --> 45:25.360]  Now that people woke up to the fact that that's real, they won't try to come save them from.
[45:25.360 --> 45:27.360]  Well, Trump sure has held pride.
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.440]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled for quadruple, depending on the
[45:31.440 --> 45:33.680]  drug once you buy it and sign that executive order.
[45:33.680 --> 45:35.600]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[45:35.600 --> 45:39.680]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed and now people are
[45:39.680 --> 45:42.480]  going to feel the sting and the pain.
[45:42.480 --> 45:43.480]  Energy costs, everything else.
[45:43.480 --> 45:48.360]  What's really illustrated this is the trial of the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are
[45:48.360 --> 45:53.040]  attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all
[45:53.040 --> 45:58.160]  sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in, folks, the swamp is deep.
[45:58.160 --> 46:00.200]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[46:00.200 --> 46:01.760]  We told you it was coming.
[46:01.760 --> 46:06.120]  Under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore, for eight months they've made the citizens
[46:06.120 --> 46:11.280]  wear bracelets on their arms that make some social dishes and report them back to spell
[46:11.280 --> 46:12.760]  towers to track for every movement.
[46:12.760 --> 46:15.560]  This is for everybody, the way it gets better.
[46:15.560 --> 46:20.480]  Now France has programs in their factories, government push and sponsor to make everyone
[46:20.480 --> 46:26.120]  wear actual dog collars so they can make their social distance and report back to their computers.
[46:26.120 --> 46:28.480]  They're turning us into a commodity.
[46:28.480 --> 46:30.840]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[46:30.840 --> 46:31.960]  It's all being announced.
[46:31.960 --> 46:37.120]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations
[46:37.120 --> 46:42.960]  downplay that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they've produced.
[46:42.960 --> 46:43.960]  Do you understand?
[46:43.960 --> 46:47.400]  It is a takeover of the entire species at the genetic level and now they're coming with
[46:47.400 --> 46:51.600]  dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S. starting next year it
[46:51.600 --> 46:52.600]  will begin.
[46:52.600 --> 46:53.680]  Did you hear me?
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.720]  Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[46:57.720 --> 47:03.160]  Imple Wars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[47:03.160 --> 47:24.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:24.680 --> 47:48.760]  In the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[47:48.760 --> 48:03.880]  Listen, I'm not trying to be negative and say things to scare you.
[48:03.880 --> 48:09.160]  I remember many years ago, I was in an off record meeting talking to one of the main
[48:09.160 --> 48:14.760]  representatives of the New World Order and they said, Jones, you just scare them for
[48:14.760 --> 48:15.760]  us.
[48:15.760 --> 48:16.760]  We're not really worried about you.
[48:16.760 --> 48:19.840]  Years later, they figured out there were a lot of folks that weren't scared and actually
[48:19.840 --> 48:20.840]  decided to take action.
[48:20.840 --> 48:27.720]  They're not as cowardly as we thought, let's shut all the speech down.
[48:27.720 --> 48:30.760]  But they thought I was actually scaring people for them with fear porn.
[48:30.760 --> 48:32.920]  See, I don't care about the cowards.
[48:32.920 --> 48:35.800]  The cowards aren't going to be in this fight anyways.
[48:35.800 --> 48:40.480]  I'm here telling you how bad things are so you figure out that this is a total takeover
[48:40.480 --> 48:42.560]  and you realize that you've got to resist it.
[48:42.560 --> 48:50.560]  I can't help because my brain wargames every facet of this, but think about selling out.
[48:50.560 --> 48:53.040]  I want to be clear.
[48:53.040 --> 48:56.120]  I'm not wanting to sell out.
[48:56.120 --> 49:00.440]  I'm not going to sell out.
[49:00.440 --> 49:06.760]  It's that just knowing that option is there and then your brain molds it over, well, why
[49:06.760 --> 49:08.000]  don't I sell out to them?
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.040]  Well, because they're Satanists and they're so unhappy and they're bad and God's real
[49:12.040 --> 49:18.160]  and God is in control and it's a trap what they've gotten into and it's just horrible
[49:18.160 --> 49:22.760]  and I don't want to be part of exterminating 99% of people.
[49:22.760 --> 49:24.840]  That's the real number.
[49:24.840 --> 49:28.640]  I mean, I look at these globalist minions and they're not happy people.
[49:28.640 --> 49:33.000]  They're scared and they're scared at night and they're not empowered and they're not
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.440]  close to God and they just live in fear and I will not be with these people.
[49:37.440 --> 49:41.200]  So this broadcast is not about fear, but it's about reality.
[49:41.200 --> 49:47.040]  We're seeing things done to the country like cutting main oil and gas pipelines off that
[49:47.040 --> 49:51.280]  cost 20-something million dollars a bill and just telling the builders of it, stick it
[49:51.280 --> 49:52.920]  up your rear end.
[49:52.920 --> 49:56.040]  We're seeing the border completely dissolved.
[49:56.040 --> 49:59.520]  We are seeing the public told, stay locked down.
[49:59.520 --> 50:03.280]  You're not essential and it goes on and on and on.
[50:03.280 --> 50:04.400]  You've got to get angry.
[50:04.400 --> 50:09.800]  You've got to get tribal as a human with red blood and realize the globalists are assaulting
[50:09.800 --> 50:16.960]  you, they're coming after you and things are only going to get worse until you realize
[50:16.960 --> 50:20.680]  that.
[50:20.680 --> 50:26.240]  You know, I have stacks of articles here where the feds are SWAT teaming people who were
[50:26.240 --> 50:30.000]  just peacefully at the capital rally and they're doing that to scare people.
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.280]  Hey, you better not ever go out in public.
[50:31.280 --> 50:32.280]  We'll come to your house.
[50:32.280 --> 50:35.600]  They're just getting you used to seeing that in the news and all this is going to lead
[50:35.600 --> 50:42.160]  to is a horrible, bloody civil war that the chai comms also want.
[50:42.160 --> 50:45.760]  So I'm just going to tell the FBI and I'm going to tell the military and I'm going to
[50:45.760 --> 50:47.800]  tell everybody else this right now.
[50:47.800 --> 50:50.880]  They brought in a bunch of Obama appointees as officers.
[50:50.880 --> 50:54.720]  Trump couldn't get rid of them and we've got globalists in control of the military.
[50:54.720 --> 50:57.240]  There are some good people in the military.
[50:57.240 --> 51:09.120]  But the FBI and the military know that this is a plan to trigger a civil war that will
[51:09.120 --> 51:14.640]  actually take them out for the next phase, a Chinese attack on the United States.
[51:14.640 --> 51:18.200]  And the globalists are only not doing that because they're worried that Russia might
[51:18.200 --> 51:19.200]  get involved.
[51:19.200 --> 51:24.240]  The United States approached Russia in the 60s and asked if they wanted to join in on
[51:24.240 --> 51:27.280]  the joint strike on China, Russia declined.
[51:27.280 --> 51:30.320]  That was declassified a long time ago.
[51:30.320 --> 51:35.880]  And so this is the type of stuff that goes on at this level of the real world.
[51:35.880 --> 51:38.800]  And so America's not invincible.
[51:38.800 --> 51:41.360]  America's not all powerful.
[51:41.360 --> 51:45.760]  And America doesn't have control of the space-based weapons and all this.
[51:45.760 --> 51:49.440]  The globalists have control of all of that.
[51:49.440 --> 51:54.880]  Now they want to mop up the decent Americans that aren't going to let their kid go to drag
[51:54.880 --> 51:59.240]  king story time, that aren't going to take an mRNA vaccine, that aren't going to salute
[51:59.240 --> 52:00.240]  foreign flags.
[52:00.240 --> 52:04.480]  That's why they always have the flag of half mass for some death to demoralize you.
[52:04.480 --> 52:08.600]  Why they always take a knee at the Super Bowl or they take a knee at the basketball game
[52:08.600 --> 52:17.560]  because it's all about everything you stand for, everything that was there is going away.
[52:17.560 --> 52:26.160]  So you can pretend all day long that this is going to just, you know, turn out okay.
[52:26.160 --> 52:30.160]  And so many people, I was on Steven Crowder's show, dad's really nice, his mom's really
[52:30.160 --> 52:33.520]  nice, met them, he's a really good guy.
[52:33.520 --> 52:37.200]  But there he is watching cancel culture and just try to have fun and, you know, smoke
[52:37.200 --> 52:40.000]  a cigar, have a glass of whiskey or whatever.
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.400]  And I had a lot of fun going up in Dallas and seeing him.
[52:44.400 --> 52:48.520]  But I mean, I just told them, you know, after the interview, I said, you know, it's all
[52:48.520 --> 52:49.520]  over.
[52:49.520 --> 52:50.520]  You know, they're never turning the power back on.
[52:50.520 --> 52:51.520]  This is a take-off.
[52:51.520 --> 52:56.720]  And people look at me and they understand they're concerned because, hey, you don't
[52:56.720 --> 52:59.320]  think I just want things to go back to where I go to the bowling alley whenever I wanted
[52:59.320 --> 53:02.120]  to or go get a pizza with my kids whenever I want to.
[53:02.120 --> 53:03.120]  It's all over, folks.
[53:03.120 --> 53:05.320]  They're just getting you used to it's all over.
[53:05.320 --> 53:09.840]  I mean, there's a very chilling clip I'm going to play next hour with this socky lady.
[53:09.840 --> 53:12.760]  Everybody pointed out, oh, they asked how we're going to help small businesses during the
[53:12.760 --> 53:18.480]  COVID lockdown, and she says, oh, we appointed a woman the head of it.
[53:18.480 --> 53:20.600]  They're like, oh, that's magic.
[53:20.600 --> 53:22.680]  That'll fix everything.
[53:22.680 --> 53:23.680]  Just cocanism.
[53:23.680 --> 53:29.800]  But that isn't what's important in the two-minute clip that she put out.
[53:29.800 --> 53:31.800]  No.
[53:31.800 --> 53:39.680]  What's important is she says, they go, will we ever get back to normal?
[53:39.680 --> 53:40.880]  She goes, you can hope.
[53:40.880 --> 53:41.880]  We can all hope.
[53:41.880 --> 53:47.560]  We can all hope that maybe, maybe, now it's maybe in 10 generations.
[53:47.560 --> 53:54.680]  I mean, maybe in 5,000 years, and I have so many people I know, friends and family.
[53:54.680 --> 53:59.640]  My dad's a smart guy, and this morning I was over at his house because he's got power
[53:59.640 --> 54:07.120]  and water, and I'm taking a shower because you've got to wash that ass, and it's a quote
[54:07.120 --> 54:14.600]  from the Red Fox, and he's like, son, don't worry.
[54:14.600 --> 54:17.800]  There'll be all sorts of doctors and people out there that'll wink, wink, claim you've
[54:17.800 --> 54:21.480]  had the vaccine when you haven't, and then you'll be able to travel.
[54:21.480 --> 54:30.800]  And I said, dad, they said it doesn't matter how many shots you take, you still can't travel.
[54:30.800 --> 54:31.800]  It's all bull.
[54:31.800 --> 54:33.300]  It's all over.
[54:33.300 --> 54:34.800]  It's a problem you can't fix.
[54:34.800 --> 54:36.800]  Why do you think Pfizer?
[54:36.800 --> 54:38.920]  It has been kicked out of India.
[54:38.920 --> 54:42.000]  Why do you think they've been kicked out of South Africa?
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.200]  Why do you think they're having to suspend it all over the place?
[54:44.200 --> 54:47.400]  I mean, the country of India banned Bill Gates' main vaccine.
[54:47.400 --> 54:49.280]  Gates is behind the Pfizer one.
[54:49.280 --> 54:50.280]  It's the worst one.
[54:50.280 --> 54:51.280]  It's the first one.
[54:51.280 --> 54:52.280]  It's the big one.
[54:52.280 --> 54:53.280]  It's the meanie.
[54:53.280 --> 54:54.280]  The others are bad as hell, too.
[54:54.280 --> 54:56.480]  These mRNA suckers.
[54:56.480 --> 55:02.720]  And I just preached to my parents for about 10 minutes, and my mom said, I know it's all
[55:02.720 --> 55:03.720]  true.
[55:03.720 --> 55:04.720]  I know you're right, son.
[55:04.720 --> 55:06.760]  I'm going to pray and God's in control.
[55:06.760 --> 55:07.760]  And I said, absolutely.
[55:07.760 --> 55:12.600]  But you've got to warn other people, because my sister was over there with her husband.
[55:12.600 --> 55:15.520]  They're all having fun, drinking coffee and everything else, because my sister's powers
[55:15.520 --> 55:16.520]  out, too.
[55:16.520 --> 55:18.800]  So we're all back at mommy's house.
[55:18.800 --> 55:21.440]  And I just said, do you think I want to sit here and give you this speech?
[55:21.440 --> 55:24.000]  Every person has to inform everybody around them now.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.400]  Soon there won't be shows, folks.
[55:26.400 --> 55:28.440]  We're not going to be on air soon.
[55:28.440 --> 55:30.640]  Do you understand that?
[55:30.640 --> 55:32.080]  People keep going, how are you doing, Alex?
[55:32.080 --> 55:33.080]  Oh, boy.
[55:33.080 --> 55:34.080]  They're sure mean to you on the news.
[55:34.080 --> 55:35.840]  They're sure mean to you in those lawsuits.
[55:35.840 --> 55:39.680]  Those lawsuits are wonderful compared to this.
[55:39.680 --> 55:42.040]  That's old DNC moves.
[55:42.040 --> 55:46.160]  That's why the big DNC isn't funding the lawsuits against me anymore, because there's
[55:46.160 --> 55:55.760]  not going to be a country anymore.
[55:55.760 --> 55:56.760]  I'm going to go to break.
[55:56.760 --> 56:01.440]  I'm going to come back, you know, speak of the devil.
[56:01.440 --> 56:03.440]  Everybody around here goes, oh, Alex, don't worry.
[56:03.440 --> 56:04.440]  I stole it from Trump.
[56:04.440 --> 56:06.560]  At least you'll have more listeners now that Biden's in.
[56:06.560 --> 56:09.520]  No, I said, no, people are going to give up.
[56:09.520 --> 56:12.200]  And the censorship is going to get worse, and we'll have less funds coming in.
[56:12.200 --> 56:15.040]  And sure as hell, I was right again, because my gut's always right.
[56:15.040 --> 56:18.320]  I can analyze later why my gut's right, but it's always right.
[56:18.320 --> 56:19.320]  It's right.
[56:19.320 --> 56:20.320]  It's right.
[56:20.320 --> 56:21.320]  My spirit knows.
[56:21.320 --> 56:27.080]  It's a lot smarter than just this gray matter, and it interfaces with my gray matter.
[56:27.080 --> 56:33.560]  And I'm telling you that you better get right with Jesus right now, okay?
[56:33.560 --> 56:40.200]  This is a takeover, a military takeover, and they are going to purge the living snot out
[56:40.200 --> 56:41.200]  of them.
[56:41.200 --> 56:45.480]  They're going to kill probably a third of our military veterans and people.
[56:45.480 --> 56:47.720]  And they'll just fly over the helicopter and bomb your house.
[56:47.720 --> 56:49.720]  I mean, that's what's going to happen.
[56:49.720 --> 56:52.840]  And the public will be out there like this because they don't want to get killed.
[56:52.840 --> 56:57.720]  The average American is a cowardly sack of demonic devil-worshipping garbage.
[56:57.720 --> 57:01.720]  Your neighbors will watch the NFL while your ass is drugged out and put in a femicam so
[57:01.720 --> 57:05.520]  some potbelly pedophile can screw your kids in front of you.
[57:05.520 --> 57:06.520]  Okay?
[57:06.520 --> 57:10.280]  It's all about raping you, and you're going to find out now.
[57:10.280 --> 57:12.720]  They're going to rape you and enjoy it.
[57:12.720 --> 57:20.720]  So just remember, if you want to fund us so we can stay on air, who knows how long.
[57:20.720 --> 57:28.720]  I would get the pro-pure $50 off, pro-pure pro, their biggest, best, and most still model.
[57:28.720 --> 57:32.520]  There's tens of thousands of gallons to get out of stream, a lake, a pond, whatever.
[57:32.520 --> 57:33.520]  Everybody should have water filtration.
[57:33.520 --> 57:35.440]  It's one of the first and foremost things.
[57:35.440 --> 57:38.800]  If you don't have it, infowarstore.com is one of the only items that we don't ship out
[57:38.800 --> 57:39.800]  of our things.
[57:39.800 --> 57:40.800]  It's the rest of our things.
[57:40.800 --> 57:43.040]  Shut down for a few more days, but you'll get your orders.
[57:43.040 --> 57:50.200]  But this is out of Utah, so you can ship it out to you within 24 hours, infowarstore.com.
[57:50.200 --> 57:56.480]  Infowarstore is an archetypal, classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against
[57:56.480 --> 57:57.480]  tyranny.
[57:57.480 --> 58:02.960]  You built infowarstore, you spread the word, you prayed for us, you bought the products,
[58:02.960 --> 58:07.760]  you called in, you made recommendations, infowarstore.com is as much yours as it is
[58:07.760 --> 58:08.760]  mine.
[58:08.760 --> 58:13.280]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the de-platforming, under all the DNC lawsuits,
[58:13.280 --> 58:18.160]  under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger with band.video, redesigned
[58:18.160 --> 58:24.480]  infowarstore, all of our great crew with documentary films and 10 hours of live, radio
[58:24.480 --> 58:28.480]  and TV a day, we are the resistance, you are the resistance.
[58:28.480 --> 58:33.800]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about
[58:33.800 --> 58:38.080]  it and to continue for you to support, because this is something we built together.
[58:38.080 --> 58:42.400]  It's not just a national treasure, it's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and
[58:42.400 --> 58:44.360]  they know it and they can't stand it.
[58:44.360 --> 58:47.680]  And as everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together.
[58:47.680 --> 58:48.680]  So I salute you all.
[58:48.680 --> 58:55.400]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[58:55.400 --> 58:56.400]  of the two.
[58:56.400 --> 58:59.480]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[58:59.480 --> 59:05.120]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[59:05.120 --> 59:08.520]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[59:08.520 --> 59:13.760]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[59:13.760 --> 59:14.760]  it.
[59:14.760 --> 59:20.040]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[59:20.040 --> 59:22.440]  of total mass high-tech slavery.
[59:22.440 --> 59:26.600]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[59:26.600 --> 59:30.360]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the facts that they are truly the slave
[59:30.360 --> 59:31.360]  masters.
[59:31.360 --> 59:35.320]  A global permanent lockdown is here, it is already causing millions and millions of
[59:35.320 --> 59:36.600]  starve to death.
[59:36.600 --> 59:38.800]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[59:38.800 --> 59:42.480]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and the top general have come out
[59:42.480 --> 59:46.720]  and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[59:46.720 --> 59:47.720]  That's the facts.
[59:47.720 --> 59:54.040]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[59:54.040 --> 1:00:23.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:38.520]  I'm going to lay out all of it in the next hour piece by piece with each clip with precision.
[1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:43.240]  We're also going to show the culprits and who's behind it and the fact that they believe
[1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:46.720]  they're emboldened, they believe they're above the law, they believe they're invincible,
[1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:50.320]  they have tested this stuff out all over the world and they believe they're about to get
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:01:01.600]  away with all of it because we have a nittying, servile population that is into playing victim
[1:01:01.600 --> 1:01:06.920]  and into playing baby so they can then be abused by the system.
[1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:10.160]  And if people don't wake up to that and if people don't speak out and if people don't
[1:01:10.160 --> 1:01:16.520]  have a come to Jesus moment, a transformative moment in your life, you are going to be a
[1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:23.560]  victim of these people and you will continue to be a victim until you are dead.
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:29.680]  They're carrying out a depopulation program and they enjoy every finger licking bit of
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:30.680]  it.
[1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:37.600]  It's not that they don't care about you, they ravenously want to torture you to death and
[1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:41.720]  tear you limb from limb and murder your children in front of you.
[1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:47.520]  So if you don't understand the enemy, I do understand the enemy, I have been around real
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:53.520]  hardcore Satanist, I told you all that folks, I didn't make a damn word of it up, I have
[1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:58.720]  been around the Satanic energy, I know I have dialed into them and I'm going to explain
[1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:07.000]  to you again, Satan is 1 trillion percent real.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:11.400]  And when we didn't start standing up for other people and our children and our old people,
[1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:16.960]  the hedge of protection has been lifted and God is going to let Satan literally annihilate
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:17.960]  us.
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:24.560]  So I hope everybody enjoys it and I hope all the Satanist and I hope all the dumbasses
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:34.720]  that serve it have fun because the Satanist fear those above them and then love to torture
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:42.880]  those beneath them and that's how these psychos operate, yet no amount of art or literature
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:52.480]  or no HP Lovecraft, nothing can even approach, approach the hellish desire to vandalize the
[1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:58.040]  human species in our genetic code and then absolutely torture us and turn us into quivering
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:08.800]  piles of filth.
[1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:17.480]  And again, we have discernment through Christ, the enemy has its own sickening form of discernment
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:22.560]  and has a large understanding of the space time continuum and is able to make long term
[1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:33.680]  very accurate predictions that are almost like future crystal ball powers, but not.
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:43.280]  And they have foreseen basically most of what has already transpired and I can tell you,
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:48.480]  things are not going good for Satan, of course, you can read Revelation, things don't go well
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:53.520]  for him, he gets power for a year or so, full power and then his worship and fixes a bunch
[1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:56.640]  of problems and then everybody's like, oh, this is great, and then he turns around and
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:00.000]  starts killing everybody.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.440]  And then finally governments get freaked out, get reorganized, there's just a giant worldwide
[1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:07.520]  war, nuclear weapons, everything, I mean, it's all there folks, all described and fine
[1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:08.520]  to tell.
[1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:12.560]  And you can say, oh, that's, you know, that's a predictive programming or whatever you want
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:19.040]  to call it, whatever it is, baby, you got front row seats to it on this planet.
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:24.040]  God help us, I just cannot believe it's moving this fast.
[1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:29.280]  I mean, we are living in such historic times, I am just flabbergasted at how much danger
[1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:30.280]  everybody's in.
[1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:31.280]  I don't mind.
[1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:39.160]  I mean, folks, we are in the middle of a world government psycho science takeover with the
[1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:43.120]  most vicious, crazy, just out of control maniacs you've ever seen.
[1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:47.400]  I mean, these people are unbelievable.
[1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:51.440]  And all I could say is brace for impact because if you think things are bad now, you have
[1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:55.040]  not seen anything yet.
[1:04:55.040 --> 1:05:04.800]  Finally, we're seeing major state governments in the United States running TV and radio ads
[1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:11.440]  saying everybody take your vitamin D3, take your zinc and take your C. It's essential
[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:14.560]  for your body cells to maintain your health.
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:16.160]  Essential means you must have it.
[1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:18.680]  It's been sold out for months.
[1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:20.080]  It's winter sun.

[1:06:40.280 --> 1:07:10.120]  Well, you have lived to see it, the takedown of the western world, the end of the republic,
[1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:22.280]  but humans are not resurrected from the dead unless you're Jesus Christ or Lazarus.
[1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:27.800]  But ideas and republics can be risen from the ashes and it's the idea that America embodied
[1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:34.200]  that made the enemy so upset and you saw their counter offensive to President Trump, Bolsonaro
[1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:39.120]  and others and you saw the former mayor of London that became the prime minister, Boris
[1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:40.720]  Johnson was always a double agent.
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:46.480]  You now see him swearing allegiance to Bill Gates saying Bill Gates is in charge of the
[1:07:46.480 --> 1:07:49.320]  G8 nations.
[1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:54.720]  The UK is on the board every eight years.
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:08:01.160]  The UK is in charge of the G8 and that means NATO, the nuclear weapons, the inner pole
[1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:03.160]  and everything.
[1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:07.160]  And he said Bill Gates is in charge of that and made the statement and now, oh, it's being
[1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:10.680]  announced everywhere, Bill Gates is in charge of this, Bill Gates is in charge of that,
[1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:14.520]  Bill Gates just rubbing it in that he's our boss.
[1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:18.920]  Oh, and he's got a helper.
[1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:22.640]  He's got a helper.
[1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:23.640]  You know who the helper is?
[1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:28.000]  Oh, that's right.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:38.360]  He's got good old Michael Bloomberg.
[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:39.360]  That's right.
[1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:42.600]  Boris Johnson meets Bill Gates discussed plans to prevent future pandemics.
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:46.960]  Oh, the big lockdown system and QR codes that track everywhere we go to make sure we've
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:50.280]  got all our shots that they admit don't even protect us and are causing all these health
[1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:53.440]  problems and are getting banned in all these countries because people are getting sick and
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:54.440]  dying.
[1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:58.920]  Okay, because Bill Gates wears a pink sweater.
[1:08:58.920 --> 1:08:59.920]  Let me do it this way.
[1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:02.800]  I mentioned a lot of the news at the start of the show, but let me just let me just read
[1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:06.440]  you these headlines that I get to some of the ones I did and then I'm going to drill
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:09.560]  into a few of these and open the phones up to balance the transmission.
[1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:10.560]  Here's this one.
[1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:11.560]  It's on infowars.com.
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:14.040]  We played the video last hour.
[1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:22.320]  Biden dismisses China's Uyghur genocide as difference in cultural norms on CNN.
[1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:27.920]  If you know anything about Chinese history, oh, oh, the Chinese history, let's kiss their
[1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:28.920]  imperial ass.
[1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:33.200]  If you know anything about Chinese history and how the commoners had no rights and were
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:38.240]  slaves and how wonderful it is, sorry, if you know anything about Chinese history, it
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:43.240]  has always been a time when China has been victimized by other world.
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:44.960]  Oh, the outer world.
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:50.720]  Oh, so because China got invaded by the Huns and by the Mongols and because Japan was mean
[1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:55.520]  to them and all that, well, they get to run death camps now and on Hollywood.
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:09:57.160]  Oh, poor China.
[1:09:57.160 --> 1:10:03.160]  You know, Xi Jinping openly of speeches how he admires Stalin and Hitler and it's like,
[1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:05.160]  oh, that's okay because he's Chinese.
[1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:07.160]  He's allowed to like Hitler.
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:11.160]  Oh, George Soros ran, he helped the Nazis round up Jews.
[1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:12.160]  It's okay.
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:13.160]  Jewish though.
[1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:14.160]  Okay.
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:15.160]  Okay.
[1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:16.160]  Fine.
[1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:17.160]  Sorry.
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:22.440]  China's history, it has always been the time when China has been victimized.
[1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:26.360]  Oh, they're a victim like Black Lives Matter when they burned down your grocery store or
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:27.360]  your restaurant.
[1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:30.880]  Oh, now I understand.
[1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:37.040]  If you know anything about China's history, it's always been the time when China has been
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:42.440]  victimized by the outer world is when they haven't been unified at home.
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:44.480]  Oh, they need to be strong.
[1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:49.640]  Notice, he's dividing us, he's turning our power off, he's degrading us.
[1:10:49.640 --> 1:10:54.880]  Let's see, he's telling you how China's got to be strong though, said Biden, going on
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:11:01.160]  to say that President Xi Jinping is aiming to achieve a tightly controlled China.
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:05.200]  And remember what, again, the Prime Minister of Canada said, he said, oh, my favorite type
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:10.840]  of government is a strong dictatorship like China.
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:13.480]  Everybody's got to kiss that chai-com ass, boy.
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:20.320]  Oh, Xi Jinping, that dictator, man, you know, they murdered his sister, murdered his brother,
[1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:24.280]  he ratted out his dad, sent his dad to a slave camp.
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:31.440]  A man, Xi Jinping is a good guy, man, why he ratted out his family and helped kill his
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:37.080]  siblings within a youth movement, helped beat his sister's brains out.
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:40.480]  Man, he's good, man, he serves evil, man, he'll do bad things.
[1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:42.040]  This is a great person.
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:43.800]  He's a survivor.
[1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:49.400]  Well, after all, I mean, China was a victim, so he had to kill us, help kill his family.
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:53.680]  I mean, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, fuck, I mean, come on, he was a
[1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:54.680]  victim.
[1:11:54.680 --> 1:12:00.160]  If you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been the time when China has
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:06.280]  been victimized by the outer world, it's when they haven't been unified at home, said Biden.
[1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:12.760]  Going on to say that President Xi Jinping is aiming to achieve tightly controlled China.
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:19.360]  I'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what he's doing with
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:23.840]  the Uyghurs in the western mountains of China.
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:30.000]  Culturally, there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.280]  to follow.
[1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:38.280]  And the Asturair, one of the richest men on earth, his brother, you know, got thrown
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:40.800]  off the balcony and died because he didn't like what was being done to him.
[1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:41.800]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:47.720]  Yeah, that's part of the training, little young Anderson, when he was nine years old,
[1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:51.360]  handed over to the day runway strip system.
[1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:54.560]  That was, I'm sure, fun for him, but mommy was very proud of it.
[1:12:54.560 --> 1:12:59.440]  The other brother didn't like it too much and, you know, he killed himself, but anyways,
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:02.800]  it's okay, though, see, because it's Tim Cook's cake.
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:07.160]  And so you've got all of this going on right here, and Anderson Cooper's on there just
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:12.800]  looking pleased as punch to be hearing all this, and Anderson Cooper was also on with
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:14.560]  Bill Gates about how there's a war.
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:18.000]  It's like World War II, and the war is against carbon.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:19.640]  And of course, we're made out of carbon.
[1:13:19.640 --> 1:13:21.000]  Everything we do is based on it.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:27.680]  So here you have these psychotic rich people on TV announcing that they're going to have
[1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:31.240]  a war on us and that the war is never going to end.
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:33.800]  Yeah, look at that satanic photo.
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:44.680]  You have satanic black mass iconography, and you've got Lady Astor there with Cooper and
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:45.680]  his brother.
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:49.520]  Yeah, that doesn't look satanic or anything.
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:53.120]  None of this is scary or anything.
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:58.000]  Hey, boys, you're in a really sick club now.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.080]  Ha, ha, ha.
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:01.080]  Hope you enjoy.
[1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:04.840]  If you're a radio listener, you're not having to see this.
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:07.680]  Look at those poor children's eyes.
[1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:10.480]  Just look at those eyes.
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:12.480]  But oh, they decided to join the club.
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:17.200]  You're either going to survive or you will be thrown off a balcony.
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:25.720]  And you look at these elite families, they usually kill the firstborn son.
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:32.400]  Just something they do, you know, the devil demands a little coin.
[1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:38.560]  And that's why Pharaoh, on record, people to the 10 commandments of the Bible, oh, yeah,
[1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:39.560]  right.
[1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:45.280]  Ramses, the second or whatever, he really said kill all the firstborn of the Israelites.
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:47.240]  He did to a bunch of groups they had living there.
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:51.200]  And they actually found now the Sanskrit, and they actually found the hieroglyphs where
[1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:52.200]  he did it.
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:54.920]  Why do you want to do that?
[1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:57.640]  Because they never stop, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:57.640 --> 1:14:58.640]  It never ends.
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:00.960]  It's the same crap from the Satanist.
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:08.160]  Over and over and over and over and over again.
[1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:12.600]  So, I covered that.
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:18.040]  Let me come back, Saki says, and I'll talk about the Japanese drink, I mean the little
[1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:19.840]  redhead beauty.
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:25.000]  We will be a couple months before Biden meets the world leader.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:29.400]  We don't let spot out very often, but he'll be allowed out on a very short leash for a
[1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:30.400]  little while.
[1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:31.400]  That's what they love.
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:34.560]  It is having like a somewhat Chinese system, like some Chinese emperor didn't know who
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:35.560]  he is.
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:38.040]  And they can just do whatever they want.
[1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:41.360]  And when they're done, just flush him out and bring in whoever they want after that.
[1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:44.520]  It's just like the Vatican's going to have multiple popes at the same time.
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:46.520]  We told you all this years ago, you're going to have multiple presidents.
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:50.240]  You're going to have it just interchangeable because then we have the idea of leadership
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:53.280]  or a country or a president or anything.
[1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:57.440]  It's all just these globalists running everything with their war on men.
[1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:58.440]  Hey, everybody.
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:01.600]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:02.600]  Me too.
[1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:06.800]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:09.520]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:13.900]  That immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[1:16:13.900 --> 1:16:15.640]  You probably already believe that.
[1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:16.800]  I certainly do.
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:17.800]  So here's the thing.
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:22.200]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:26.280]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:32.040]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.
[1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:33.600]  No cures or treatments there.

[1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:42.640]  support product based on that research called Immune 10x.

[1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:05.680]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden, and now that all the
[1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:09.760]  lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:14.400]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:19.000]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:24.920]  It is the Patriots of the World versus everybody else.
[1:17:24.920 --> 1:17:31.640]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:37.800]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:44.280]  to the same, that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation for purpose
[1:17:44.280 --> 1:17:50.920]  of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:54.880]  So help me God.
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:18:02.720]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:04.040]  I just love it.
[1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:05.720]  I can't get enough of it.
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:08.680]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:09.880]  That's what fills my mug.
[1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:11.040]  That's what fills my belly.
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:12.600]  That's what fills my soul.
[1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:14.240]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:18.600]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:19.600]  Years.
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:20.600]  Never raised the price.
[1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:21.600]  Never.
[1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:22.680]  The Wake Up America blend.
[1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:23.680]  The best coffee.
[1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:24.840]  The crew here loves it.
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:25.840]  We drink it every day.
[1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:30.920]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support info wars here.
[1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:33.080]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody.
[1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:37.840]  Why not support info wars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America
[1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:38.840]  Patriot Blend?
[1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:40.280]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:41.680]  Pretty much perfect review there.
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:42.680]  4.9 star.
[1:18:42.680 --> 1:18:47.360]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody
[1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:48.360]  gets a five star.
[1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:51.240]  So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody gives it a five star, except
[1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:52.240]  maybe one or two people.
[1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:59.200]  Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:01.200]  My enemies are your enemies.
[1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:03.200]  They're the globalists, they're the starmasters.
[1:19:03.200 --> 1:19:09.960]  They are a consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers,
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:15.040]  vampires, wherever you want to call them, that are highly predatory, that are spreading
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:22.000]  up a false famously land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs and electromagnetic
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:29.400]  radiation to change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:33.360]  can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:38.280]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the news is only
[1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:40.680]  going to tie it around our necks from year on out.
[1:19:40.680 --> 1:19:44.720]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news, and want to
[1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:48.400]  only cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order, but at the end of the
[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:51.680]  day it's all about depopulation, it's all about world government, it's all about
[1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:56.360]  the end of human system as we know it, and all its ashes and nightmare being built, only
[1:19:56.360 --> 1:20:01.480]  admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[1:20:01.480 --> 1:20:09.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:14.960]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:22.160]  So again, we have a normalcy bias here in the western world with the left of Christendom,
[1:20:22.160 --> 1:20:27.880]  and that we have new process, that people are good, they're nice, they're helping, they
[1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:31.600]  stop on the side of the road if you need help, notice that doesn't really happen anymore
[1:20:31.600 --> 1:20:36.120]  in cities, and even most rural areas because we've been taught to hate each other, we've
[1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:42.840]  been taught to only care about ourselves, we've been divided, and we've been conquered.
[1:20:42.840 --> 1:20:47.680]  And so we still have this normalcy bias that, oh, we have free and fair elections, oh, you
[1:20:47.680 --> 1:20:52.360]  know, we wouldn't be sold out to China, and we're describing how at every level we're
[1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:56.160]  being positioned to end the dollar.
[1:20:56.160 --> 1:21:01.120]  And Biden and the globalists are holding America underwater because personally, they're just
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:08.760]  minions, imagine the dollar signs, and just floating up in the air, their bank accounts
[1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:14.920]  are going up, their stocks, their bonds, their investments are exploding because for 40 years
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:20.680]  they have had prohibited laws in the west to not be able to do business here.
[1:21:20.680 --> 1:21:22.400]  So everything is moved.
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:27.080]  The British government paid to have Sheffield Steel move to India.
[1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:32.120]  The British government paid to have their last coal power plant move to India.
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:36.400]  I'm going to explain that again, they didn't just shut down the last British coal power
[1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:44.680]  plant, whatever it was 10 years ago, they paid to move it to the company.
[1:21:44.680 --> 1:21:50.680]  This is called greasing the skits, and I'll cover all the energy news next segment.
[1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:55.040]  But let me give you an example, I was so busy yesterday up here trying to get the power
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:59.840]  back on and also flying up in my buddy's helicopter that he flew me up there and I
[1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:06.320]  appreciate it, and up there on Crowder Show, and when I drove to the office, I drove by
[1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:10.760]  the one Wendy's that was open nearby.
[1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:15.840]  There was a line around the corner and down the block that looked like it went two miles,
[1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:17.920]  it just never ended.
[1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:23.080]  The road about a mile away was a hill, so I couldn't see if it ended.
[1:22:23.080 --> 1:22:28.240]  And of course, I was driving into work this morning, and my buddy who's got a four-wheel
[1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:32.320]  drive truck came and picked me up, I've got a four-wheel drive vehicle also that's being
[1:22:32.320 --> 1:22:37.040]  used to ferry in the crew to get here, because a lot of them can't make it, don't have the
[1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:38.520]  right vehicle, I understand.
[1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:43.960]  So I had one of my associates ferry me in this morning in his truck, and I said, I bet
[1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:48.320]  when we get to the Wendy's, it's closed, I bet they ran out of food.
[1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:57.280]  And sure as hell, sure as Joe Biden being evil, there was no one there and it was closed
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:22:59.240]  out of food.
[1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:03.440]  And see, that's just on time delivery, only have enough for what you're currently doing,
[1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:04.640]  that's what they've got is so positioned.
[1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:10.400]  So literally, we're eating food from the gas station, I brought some food from my house,
[1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:17.600]  and we do have a 10-year supply of food for a family here at the office, and we are literally
[1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:22.600]  out there with a generator, with a stove we brought here to the office, boiling up a bunch
[1:23:22.600 --> 1:23:27.040]  of fettuccine alfredo and a bunch of other food from my Patriot supply.
[1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:32.800]  So here we are in the year 2021, and we are actually cooking the delicious, healthy, good
[1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:37.320]  food from my Patriot, go to preparewithalex.com.
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:42.160]  And not just for this blackout, I've got articles where Bill Gates bet on blackouts,
[1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:45.680]  and that's why he's doing alternative energy, knowing there'll be blackouts from windmills,
[1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:47.680]  he's coming up with other systems.
[1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:51.160]  It's all planned out, I'll cover it next segment.
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:56.000]  And so yes, if you're a TV viewer, you can see this, this is footage in Austin of people
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:03.600]  lined up down the block, hundreds of yards to get into H-E-B, the grocery store.
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:05.680]  Why do they not have food at home?
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:14.720]  I have a multi-year food supply, and I have a lot of other staples there, and now I'm
[1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:18.000]  able to bring food to the office, and I understand a lot of folks don't have extra money.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:22.040]  I'm just saying, the New World Order is all about keeping control of you, so I would go
[1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:28.720]  to preparewithalex.com, where you can get $50 off the Alexa Pure Pro, their biggest, nicest,
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:32.000]  stainless steel portable filter, great for your house, great for your cabin, great for
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.400]  a trailer, great for RV, great for work.
[1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:37.680]  You can get out of pond water, lake water, anything, it's gravity-fed, cuts everything
[1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:45.000]  bad out, it's the highest rated at a very low price, and $50 off at $216, leading competitors
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:48.280]  are $300 to $400, and don't work as good.
[1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:51.120]  And maybe that's the answer, maybe I should charge a lot more than people think it's better
[1:24:51.120 --> 1:24:55.160]  than I'd actually have extra money around here, instead of, you know, the folks we get
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:59.640]  it from making $40, we make $30 or whatever, maybe that's the problem, maybe I just treat
[1:24:59.640 --> 1:25:03.680]  people like I want to be treated, but everybody needs this unit, you need to get it, it's
[1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:07.900]  preparewithalex.com, and it's the lowest price you're going to find on high-quality
[1:25:07.900 --> 1:25:12.760]  good food that doesn't have additives and crap in it, and that has 2,000 calories per
[1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:13.760]  meal.
[1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:17.920]  A lot of other places say, oh, our food's half the price of that, well yeah, it's 1,000
[1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:19.400]  calories or whatever.
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:25.800]  It's not a meal, 2,000 calories is a meal, they've got everything, specialty foods, desserts,
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:30.120]  the whole nine yards, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of products from
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:36.520]  macaroni and cheese, to travelers stew, to beef, to just chicken, they got it, and it's
[1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:40.560]  made right here in America, and they got four big facilities, and they've got the biggest
[1:25:40.560 --> 1:25:47.000]  warehouse I've ever been in, and this company only started 14 years ago, but they exploded
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:50.240]  because they had quality and they had the lowest price, and they're very, very aggressive
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:51.240]  about that.
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:56.120]  He just took 100% of his profits in the last year and put it into this Gigantor warehouse
[1:25:56.120 --> 1:25:59.480]  that was the biggest warehouse I've ever seen, I mean, you could park a Star Destroyer in
[1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:03.600]  there, they were a real thing, I mean, it was just, you could park an aircraft carrier,
[1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:09.480]  the damn thing, and he's expanding as he believes, and he knows what's coming, so get
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:21.680]  prepared at infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139, 888-2599, I can't remember anymore, my brain
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:26.280]  is so fried, with all this stuff going on, what is the toll-free number, I need to try
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:34.560]  to get it right in my head, I know the calling number, 888-253-3139, 888, that's right, so
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:42.040]  the number I was giving out is correct, Rush Limbaugh died today at 70, that's terrible,
[1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:45.360]  because, I mean, he meant well and he did a lot of good and he got more hardcore over
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:50.200]  the years, I mean, at least his world guard came out in the open, he grew up a lot, I
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:57.000]  remember him saying the CFR didn't exist 30 years ago, bless his soul, but now, I know
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:01.200]  he became a reader of info wars, and a fan of info wars, I got told that by multiple
[1:27:01.200 --> 1:27:06.560]  people close to him, but I never got a chance to talk to Rush Limbaugh, I really like to
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:15.280]  talk to him, he's a friend, but Rush Limbaugh, American radio host, dead at 70, made the
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:21.240]  jump into hyperspace, Rush Limbaugh, the radio host who dominated conservative media for
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:26.880]  three plus decades, died today, at the age of 70, he was diagnosed with advanced lung
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:34.480]  cancer in February, held on and worked throughout most of his illness, Limbaugh received a presidential
[1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:39.520]  medal of freedom, we don't show that, from President Trump at the 2020 State of the Union
[1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:46.760]  address, just one day after revealing his diagnosis to his listeners, he is the greatest
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:51.800]  fighter and winner you'll ever meet, Trump said at the time, Rush Limbaugh, thank you
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:56.840]  for your decades of perilous devotion to the country, by the way, I know that Trump really
[1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:00.760]  liked Rush Limbaugh, because he was always telling me how much you like Rush Limbaugh
[1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:03.720]  and how you listen to Rush Limbaugh, do you like Rush and you're going to be the new Rush,
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:09.160]  when he retires and blah blah blah, I mean, I think almost every time I talked to Trump,
[1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:15.760]  he talked about Rush Limbaugh, I mean, he loved Rush Limbaugh, loves Rush Limbaugh, and Trump
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:20.520]  really tried to save the country, he tried to co-opt the system, tried to go and come
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:24.480]  on, let's not destroy America for China, let's not do this, let's not teach five-year-olds
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:29.480]  how to get blowjobs, let's not sterilize all our boys, let's not, and they just said,
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:34.960]  no, we're doing it, and that's where we are, and so it's really sad, and that's why I
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:39.600]  go back to the Q thing, I tried to warn all the people, they're like, Alex, the lockdown
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:43.720]  is so they can round up all the pedophiles, Alex, the power is going to go out soon,
[1:28:43.720 --> 1:28:46.880]  so they can arrest everybody, and I go, yeah, when Biden gets in, he's going to turn the
[1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:51.680]  power off, all right, I'm going to come back and I'm going to prove and document all of
[1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:58.680]  that, the energy news on the other side.
[1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:28.680]  Let's go to handgunconversion.com, that's handgunconversion.com.
[1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:58.680]  Let's go to handgunconversion.com.
[1:30:21.680 --> 1:30:28.680]  Let's go to handgunconversion.com, that's handgunconversion.com, that's handgunconversion.com,
[1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:58.680]  let's go to handgunconversion.com, that's handgunconversion.com, that's handgunconversion.com,
[1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:28.680]  let's go to handgunconversion.com, that's handgunconversion.com, that's handgunconversion.com,
[1:31:51.680 --> 1:31:58.680]  let's go to handgunconversion.com, that's handgunconversion.com, that's handgunconversion.com,
[1:32:21.680 --> 1:32:28.680]  we're going to give up and threaten because we are effective.
[1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:31.840]  Great awakening is here.
[1:32:31.840 --> 1:32:37.840]  Go to band.video, download the videos and share.
[1:32:37.840 --> 1:33:04.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:07.840 --> 1:33:25.440]  There's a way out of this. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. You've got to study the
[1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:28.720]  globalist. You've got to learn their attack plan. And then you're going to know what they're
[1:33:28.720 --> 1:33:33.240]  going to do next and how to warn others. And if you warn people before it happens, then they'll
[1:33:33.240 --> 1:33:39.000]  listen to you later. That's why we're so dangerous, because we successfully did that. And remember,
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:42.440]  I don't know how long infowars.com can stay on there. I don't know how long we can stay on
[1:33:42.440 --> 1:33:47.720]  there here. This is a systematic takedown, a takeover of civilization and society.
[1:33:49.480 --> 1:33:51.960]  So let me lay out what we're facing and what we're really dealing with.
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:33:58.600]  I have a moral responsibility to tell you what's going on, even if I'm going to be
[1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:05.480]  attacked for doing it. So I have sworn on the altar of God that I will do that. Now, only those of
[1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:08.840]  you that have been listening on a regular basis will know everything I'm saying has already been
[1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:13.880]  said exactly as I'm saying it now. And you see exactly as I said, it's now unfolding. This is a
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:19.080]  program. This is a plan. They've all beta tested this before. And they act the same. These dictators,
[1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:24.600]  these authoritarians do the same crap. I said just last week in a report that I helped write with
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:28.760]  Gregory's that they'll soon start having rolling blackouts and turning the power off within days
[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:34.440]  that happen. Not hard. That's what they're doing, cutting off the pipeline, cutting off the drilling
[1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:40.200]  to 60% of the country. I mean, they mean business. So let me show TV viewers some photos,
[1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:48.280]  very powerful videos on Twitter. Go to infowars.com. The image of only downtown Austin,
[1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:53.640]  only the skyscrapers, only the big buildings, only the government buildings having power.
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:57.080]  Can we put that back on screen? You were just showing it a moment ago for TV viewers.
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:03.080]  And when you see those photos, that's just one of them. There's even more dramatic ones that show
[1:35:03.080 --> 1:35:10.120]  the whole downtown. One of the articles you'll find it in is on infowars.com.
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:16.360]  Downtown Austin glowing bright while thousands went, no, millions went without power. It's
[1:35:16.360 --> 1:35:23.800]  complicated. Austin Energy says, oh, Austin Energy says, I'm going to lay out what really
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:27.240]  happened and what's really going on and what's coming next in a moment. And again,
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:34.520]  it's not that I'm that smart. I know the enemy. It's like, say, when you're fishing for bass
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:39.960]  with a purple worm, you know, when that big bass hits that worm, give them a second to eat it
[1:35:39.960 --> 1:35:44.920]  and then pull up on it. So you plant the hook and then start reeling them in. It's a big fish.
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:49.960]  Let them run out and get tired. It's like teaching a child how things are. It's a globalist, though,
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:57.560]  act just like a bass does. They've got the way they do things. So they've got us down right now,
[1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:02.520]  and they are kicking the living hell out of us. And until we wake up to it and realize they just
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:09.400]  put a dictator in and so they don't care. And until there's a mass total awakening and mass
[1:36:09.400 --> 1:36:15.800]  demonstrations everywhere, it's only going to get worse. So again, I'm not telling you it's
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:19.560]  going to get worse to scare you. I'm saying it's only going to get worse till you figure it out
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:23.160]  and say no. And I know the general audience knows that, but I'm talking to the law sheep out there.
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:29.800]  But see, they can't have me on air anymore, can they? Because everything we say is accurate,
[1:36:29.800 --> 1:36:34.840]  basically, and folks are actually listening. I can basically convince anybody of the truth,
[1:36:34.840 --> 1:36:39.080]  showing them the facts. The problem is, then they go, well, what do I do? They don't see themselves
[1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:42.440]  as leaders. We need to get them moving forward. But let me just get back to this.
[1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:49.880]  How many times have I said, shall Chescue like to only keep the power on in the central district
[1:36:49.880 --> 1:36:55.240]  of the capital city? The Romanian dictator.
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:04.520]  And he did that as an act of power and control. And there's film footage and photos of it.
[1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:11.000]  And where you see the lights on in his palace, but nobody else had the lights on.
[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:16.920]  And you notice Joe Biden said during the debate with Trump, a dark winter is coming. This is
[1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:20.440]  going to be a really bad winter with COVID. And I'm not going to take my boot off your neck. And
[1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:24.920]  there's going to be all sorts of power problems because he's there cutting the power off.
[1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:31.720]  So let me show you some of the history of this. And again, I don't have the document
[1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:35.720]  cam shot because most of the equipment's still down because we have the generators,
[1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:39.240]  but not wired in correctly because there's so many electrical wires and systems.
[1:37:39.240 --> 1:37:43.640]  So a problem we failed, we probably won't even fix it. We'll probably just shut down. I don't
[1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:46.760]  think I'm actually capable to keep this place going much longer. I'm trying. The crew's great,
[1:37:46.760 --> 1:37:50.200]  but, you know, I paid a live crew's great, but the people that have the discipline to run the
[1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:55.080]  show are the best. But I just, I don't know anymore. I'm just being honest. Inron link to
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:38:00.840]  California Blackouts. Now this is from a long time ago, MarketWatch. I just thought I'd pull
[1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:07.720]  this up from 15 years ago because it came out in court that they would do rolling blackouts to
[1:38:07.720 --> 1:38:14.200]  convince people that was a power shortage so they could raise prices. And the only reason they got
[1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:19.560]  shut down was because they weren't a total globalist player and the globalist, one of this technology
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:22.840]  for themselves. And it turns out that other globalist companies have been doing this in third
[1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:32.040]  world nations and other nations in Europe for a very long time. So there it is. Biden rescinds
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:37.880]  Trump order banning Chinese communist involvement in U.S. power grid. That just happened a month ago.
[1:38:40.920 --> 1:38:46.760]  Urcott power outages in Texas could last an indeterminate amount of time. I was listening
[1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:51.880]  to local talk radio. They had a spokesman on about three hours ago on 590 and they said it'll
[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:59.160]  be until next weekend. Not this weekend, but another week after that. Oh, and now they say
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:03.480]  critical infrastructure might have to be turned off just to play the Kabuki theater with you
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:07.720]  since they notice all the big city stuff still kept on. Now they're going to turn some of that off
[1:39:07.720 --> 1:39:13.240]  and say, oh, see, we lost power too. But they admit that they're commanding where the power's on,
[1:39:13.240 --> 1:39:18.920]  where the power's off. They've turned off most of the city because we're a good liberal city
[1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:24.120]  in the Urcott system and we don't own a coal plant. The city shut down an old coal plant
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:32.120]  and two big brand new ones under Obama. They were so proud of it. Obama didn't even order no
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:37.560]  shutdown. The city of Austin divested the billions of dollars it took to build it starting in the
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:43.800]  80s and 90s and just ordered it completely shut down. But there was one part of the Fayetteville
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:49.960]  facility that they didn't own. It's one giant modern plant still going and the city of Austin
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:56.680]  has been battling and suing stakeholders, as they're called out of Houston in that plant,
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:40:03.720]  battling to have our last generator blown. So we even did joke videos from Empire Strikes Back where
[1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:08.760]  you got the Admiral or the General and he's down there in Imperial Walker. He tells Darth Vader,
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:14.680]  we've reached the shield, you may start your landing, target generator, maximum firepower,
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:20.600]  and they destroy it. I mean, literally blowing our generators, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:40:21.880 --> 1:40:26.840]  that's what these people are doing. It's an act of war. Oh, and then it gets better.
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:37.000]  It turns out Bill Gates has been betting on power outages and power shortages and so he's been
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:42.440]  investing in all these other systems that he's going to force you to buy and force you to take.
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:48.600]  Here's an article out of Geekwire about him and Jeff Bezos. So they don't even hide any of this.
[1:40:48.600 --> 1:40:55.080]  They're all very, very proud of the whole thing. Now, here's another big question. Was that giant
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:41:05.880]  Arctic vortex blast weather modification? And the answer is, we don't know. We know that HARP
[1:41:05.880 --> 1:41:13.320]  is up in Alaska. There are other major arrays and other major systems and
[1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:21.320]  they are able, with that Arctic stream, to control it and punch it through and steer it
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:25.480]  and make it break into areas it wouldn't normally break into. But there's a reason growing up here
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:31.240]  in Texas every house has fireplaces because, you know, when my dad was little, it snowed and a lot
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:35.480]  in Texas and it snowed more when my mother was little. And then we went through a little bit
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:40.600]  of a warm spell. It goes up and down. We know that from the mud samples and the studies and
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:43.640]  the ring structures of the trees. We know things go through these cycles.
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:51.480]  But they do have these technologies. These technologies do exist. And here's the CIA director
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:58.600]  six years ago on C-SPAN at the Council on Farm Relations admitting to this along with Joe Biden
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:07.720]  talking about dark winter. Here it is. We're still, we're still facing a very dark winter.
[1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:14.920]  We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter. Truthfully, we remain in a very dark winter.
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:22.360]  Another example is the array of technologies, often referred to collectively as geoengineering,
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:25.800]  that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:31.240]  One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection or SAI,
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:36.200]  a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:42.600]  in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do. An SAI program could limit global temperature
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:47.560]  increases, reducing some risks associated with fire. Oh, yeah. So you cool the atmosphere off
[1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:51.400]  and then we get Arctic blast. I see. But then you're not supposed to even say they have this
[1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:56.200]  technology. I'll come back with a full clip on the other side. Target, maximum firepower.
[1:42:57.240 --> 1:43:03.320]  I sell supplements for two reasons. Because they work, they're real, they're powerful,
[1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:08.920]  and because it's a giant market. But again, why is there a giant market? Because it works.
[1:43:09.640 --> 1:43:14.520]  That's why it exponentially grows. So whether it's salt palm meadow and other key ingredients
[1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:22.920]  in our prostate formula, prostagard, or whether it is the super high grade organic bottom and
[1:43:22.920 --> 1:43:30.200]  B12 and ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force, or the pure deep
[1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:35.720]  earth crystal iodine on the next two, these are all the very best supplements you're going to find
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:41.960]  in an already great market of high quality products out there. And it funds the info award.
[1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:45.480]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're funding the info awards,
[1:43:45.480 --> 1:43:51.080]  you can't lose info awards delivers in space. Please visit info or store.com and get the
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:56.040]  products today. Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at info or store.com.
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:44:02.920]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with
[1:44:02.920 --> 1:44:08.680]  facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental
[1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:15.240]  condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com. Studies have suggested
[1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:21.560]  that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:27.240]  levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:34.680]  responses and joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA
[1:44:34.680 --> 1:44:41.960]  fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:44:41.960 --> 1:44:48.520]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts
[1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:54.520]  that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at
[1:44:54.520 --> 1:45:03.000]  info wars store.com. I knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:10.360]  double talking agents of the enemy. A lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like,
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:15.400]  oh no, it's 3G chest, 5G chest, he's invincible. And I understand why people wanted to believe
[1:45:15.400 --> 1:45:19.400]  that because this is scary what's going on. The global government in the New World Order and
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:22.440]  now that people hold up the facts that's real, they won't somebody to come save them from.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:27.880]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried. My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:31.240]  or quadrupled, depending on the drug, once you buy it and sign that executive order.
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:35.320]  We pay the most money by the world. That's just one case of hundreds of things
[1:45:35.880 --> 1:45:39.880]  that Trump had reversed and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain,
[1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:44.760]  the energy cost, everything else. But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate
[1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:49.400]  where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:55.720]  and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks. The swamp is deep.
[1:45:55.720 --> 1:46:01.880]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it. The entire New World Order system is about making
[1:46:01.880 --> 1:46:07.960]  you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:12.920]  your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have
[1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:19.160]  being given free will. Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:25.000]  of an entire universe, an entire system. And the fact that you're able to commune with God,
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:29.400]  the fact that you're able to see the beauty of a sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean
[1:46:29.400 --> 1:46:33.880]  or the beauty of your wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge,
[1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:38.280]  the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:44.840]  energetic and that itself is what God teaches us is worship. So don't worship the globalist,
[1:46:44.840 --> 1:46:50.120]  don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God
[1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:55.080]  because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while
[1:46:55.080 --> 1:47:06.040]  you still have it, while you still have it. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:25.480]  Red Alert, Red Alert. Next hour I'm taking your calls. I'm your host Alex Jones 877-789-2539.
[1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:32.360]  I'd like to hear from people in Texas who have been without power who'd like to tell your stories
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:41.960]  and give your take on the situation. 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539. And I'm not trying to be negative.
[1:47:41.960 --> 1:47:45.720]  Info Wars has had a long, hard, strong run in the fight against the globalists,
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:52.600]  but there is basically no money coming in at infowarstore.com. People were so excited about
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:57.000]  Trump. They thought he was invincible. They were mad at me because I was saying he was being set up
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:01.720]  and surrounded and was begging for help. And I mean, I was talking to Rod Stone, I was talking
[1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:05.080]  to lawyers at work with Trump and I've talked to Trump quite a bit on the phone. I mean,
[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:08.680]  I knew what was going on and people who didn't want to believe me and they got pissed at me,
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:12.200]  you know, not lying to you. I'm just not going to lie to you. We're in deep trouble.
[1:48:13.240 --> 1:48:16.600]  And so if you'd like to keep us on air and get great products you need already,
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:23.160]  I'd go to infowarstore.com. We won't be able to ship out of the warehouse until next week.
[1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:28.600]  We are not an essential group like Walmart or like Target. They're all open, doing great right now.
[1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:33.080]  We are scum. We're Americans that have a warehouse and have real products we make and
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:39.480]  sell and we're all scum. Our office doesn't have power. We're not essential. Our backup
[1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:44.280]  batteries went out after about six hours. We have generators, but something this big,
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:49.800]  the city wouldn't let us at this facility have the permit for the generator we needed.
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:55.240]  Everybody else can have them. We can't. That's how it is with Alex Jones, folks. You don't get
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:58.920]  bank accounts. You don't get, oh, you're Alex Jones. You're not getting a permit for that.
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:04.040]  Everybody else gets it. So if you want, these are communists and I'm not a victim. I just
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:07.560]  have been experiencing what you're going to be experiencing soon for a long time.
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:14.760]  So if you order the Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system at infowarstore.com,
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:18.280]  that is going to be shipped to you within a day out of Utah and they're up and running and know
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:24.280]  how to deal with the snow. And that funds our operation. We got to sell a lot of those at $50
[1:49:24.280 --> 1:49:28.200]  off because there's not a lot of profit in them, but it's something everybody needs. So if you
[1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:32.040]  sat on the fence about having a stainless steel water filter that you can get out of a snowy
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:36.040]  puddle or you can get out of a lake, get out of a creek, it makes everything safe to drink,
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:41.160]  cuts out all the garbage, infowarstore.com. Everybody needs one and it takes money to
[1:49:41.160 --> 1:49:47.480]  run this operation. I mortgaged my house last year to help fund the operation. Then the pandemic
[1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:50.600]  came along and it brought in a little bit more funds. We kind of dug ourselves out of a hole
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:55.320]  from a year before. And then now I'm watching the hourglass run through the money with the crew
[1:49:55.320 --> 1:49:59.880]  that's paid and they're great and everything. But I mean, I just, I mean, I don't have $100,000
[1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:04.200]  is kind of the proper generator systems with all the damn stuff. They want me to build a building
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:10.440]  and then do all this crap. So yes, I know I should have generators for the whole system. I know that.
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:14.520]  You know, I should have it all at my house. I've got some solar panels. They're hooked up.
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:19.320]  They can run a few appliances. But no, I mean, my power is off. I'm over there,
[1:50:19.320 --> 1:50:25.160]  but my parents taken a bath. I waters off. Oh, and I knew it yesterday. The city said,
[1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:30.600]  there's a rumor that the water will not be coming to you soon. That's not true. And then I confirmed
[1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:35.160]  with city people. I know that the water went off in my house yesterday and they said, Oh, no,
[1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:40.600]  it's it's not frozen. The plumber told us who also works for the city. He said, they just turned
[1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:45.800]  the water off to most of the city. So when you hear them say we're not going to turn your water off,
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:50.360]  people always do in communist countries. Don't believe something until it's denied.
[1:50:51.960 --> 1:50:55.480]  And then as soon as you hear something out of his mouth, you know, it's a lie.
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:51:00.680]  But hell, Biden's so evil. He doesn't care. He stole the election. Why didn't he have to campaign?
[1:51:00.680 --> 1:51:04.520]  Why do you tell a group of people to rally? I don't need you to win.
[1:51:06.280 --> 1:51:11.080]  I don't need you to win. I don't need you to campaign to win. And I went, look, folks, he's telling you
[1:51:11.080 --> 1:51:19.000]  because they're trying to demoralize us and destroy our morale. They think humiliating us like this
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:24.920]  will make us give up. And you're like, well, Jones, you're talking about giving up. I'm not giving
[1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:31.720]  up. I'm giving out like a horse has been carrying too much too long. I want you to know how serious
[1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:39.080]  this is. You want us to go off the air? You want us to just shut it down? Because if people don't
[1:51:39.080 --> 1:51:44.120]  get serious and understand what's happening, I'll never sell off the boat. But at a certain point,
[1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:49.000]  ladies and gentlemen, there's not enough serious people around me. This crew in here because
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:54.840]  they work with me and they're great. They're serious and they kick ass. But almost everybody else I know
[1:51:55.400 --> 1:51:59.880]  doesn't give a rat's ass. And once you just sit there and watch Netflix, now some of them are
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:06.680]  pissed because the power's off. And so all I'm getting at is everyone needs vitamin D3. We have
[1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:10.840]  the highest quality with vitamin K for your immune system and all the stuff they're releasing and
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:14.120]  the crap they're pulling. If you don't have that and if you're not digging it, you're crazy.
[1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:22.520]  It's 25% off. Selling out infowarstore.com. We have Ultra 12, 50% off, highest quality V12,
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:29.800]  get them together, 40% off. And as soon as we can turn the power back on in our warehouse,
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:35.480]  we'll ship it to you. But I told you on Monday, I said, they're not turning the power on Tuesday
[1:52:35.480 --> 1:52:39.960]  night. They're not turning it on Wednesday night. They're not turning it on Thursday night.
[1:52:39.960 --> 1:52:44.040]  They're not turning it on Friday or Saturday or Sunday or Monday or Tuesday. They'll never
[1:52:44.040 --> 1:52:50.600]  turn it on if you don't get mad. Ever. This is who they, you understand? The White House Press
[1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:56.680]  Secretary said, they said, she's reading questions and she goes, will the lockdowns ever end? She
[1:52:56.680 --> 1:53:06.840]  goes, or will the, she goes, you can hope. Probably no, never. You can hope though. And they all
[1:53:06.840 --> 1:53:11.880]  get raises and they get electricity and they get medicine because they're the elite. They're the
[1:53:11.880 --> 1:53:17.800]  big guys. That's all. There's, there's, there's, they get off on the exclusivity of it all.
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:24.040]  I thought Hollywood was interesting. I like some movies. So I actually got out to Hollywood and
[1:53:24.040 --> 1:53:29.000]  invited out there a lot and I didn't like it. And I hated it. It was empty and gross and fake. And
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:33.400]  all these people just getting off and like pretending they're powerful and they're
[1:53:33.400 --> 1:53:39.160]  famous and they're rich and all the exclusivity and oh, they're getting the latest exclusive thing.
[1:53:39.160 --> 1:53:43.560]  And they're so exclusive and they worship things and it's all they care about.
[1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:49.160]  And they are the most empty, soulless people on earth. And let me tell you, I look at Obama
[1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:53.960]  because that's who Biden is. I look at Obama's puppet and I look at, at, at, at, at the press
[1:53:53.960 --> 1:53:59.800]  secretary and how hateful and weird she is and just how committed to evil they are. And I just
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:08.280]  think God, I'm not one of these people because I mean, these people, they're just of their father.
[1:54:08.280 --> 1:54:16.680]  They are, they're bad people, ladies and gentlemen. And they're disgusting and they're fake and they
[1:54:16.680 --> 1:54:21.160]  try to glare at you with a fake smile. Like they've got something you don't have. No folks,
[1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:28.200]  you've got something they don't have. And it's all collapsing. All the blue cities are collapsing.
[1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.440]  All the communist systems are collapsing and that's why they want to collapse you because
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:38.280]  they are so miserable and unhappy and alone that they don't know what to do.
[1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:45.960]  So it's declassified that harp systems can take the Arctic vortex and break it down through warm
[1:54:45.960 --> 1:54:52.040]  air and actually drive it as far south. Many experts have said as the equator, if they wanted to,
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:57.080]  it would cause violent storms, the likes of which have never been seen. Was that what we just saw?
[1:54:57.080 --> 1:55:01.480]  No, because we know that these Arctic blasts have been regular thing anyways, but can they
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:06.120]  control them? Yes. Is it legitimate to ask the question, did they do it? Yes. Couldn't they? Yes.
[1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:12.920]  Do they selectively turn off all the neighborhoods except downtown, the elite area? Yes. Do they
[1:55:12.920 --> 1:55:20.280]  throw it in your face? Yes. They're teaching you that you're not essential. And I told you,
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:25.400]  next we'll be rolling power outages. Enron did it. Enron came up with carbon taxes. Enron wrote
[1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:31.240]  the book. Here's the former CIA director when he was currently CIA six years ago on C-Span.
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:37.880]  A method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat
[1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:44.120]  and much the same way that volcanic eruptions do. An SAI program could limit global temperature
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:48.600]  increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:54.760]  world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels. This process is also relatively
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:56:00.520]  inexpensive. The National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost
[1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:07.400]  about $10 billion yearly. As promising as it may be, moving forward on SAI would also raise a
[1:56:07.400 --> 1:56:12.360]  number of challenges for our government and for the international community. On the technical side,
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:17.400]  greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:23.480]  change effects, such as ocean acidification, because SAI alone would not remove greenhouse
[1:56:23.480 --> 1:56:29.960]  gases from the atmosphere. On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:36.440]  patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:44.680]  opposition by some nations. On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather
[1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:52.920]  patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp
[1:56:52.920 --> 1:57:01.960]  opposition by some nations. And so what you do is just give Nobel prizes out for it in 1992 for
[1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:07.240]  geoengineering with the airplane exhaust, having aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and even radioactive
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:10.920]  ice tubs added to create nuclear on the atmosphere and block out the sun, which they've been doing.
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:14.600]  That's the class five. $5 billion a year Department of Energy alone just haven't added the fuel.
[1:57:16.920 --> 1:57:22.680]  Unbelievable. And Vinny just talks to you like you're a baby. He goes, oh, that doesn't exist.
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:27.800]  What are you talking about? There's no weather modification going on. These aren't the droids
[1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:33.320]  you're looking for. Other cheesy Star Wars analogy. Weather, climate, what caused Hurricane Sandy?
[1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:39.800]  Folks, they've been controlling and steering hurricanes declassified in 2004. They've been
[1:57:39.800 --> 1:57:44.280]  doing it since the 1960s. We'll be right back with our number three in your phone.
[1:57:48.440 --> 1:57:53.720]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply, secure your own safe source of food supply
[1:57:53.720 --> 1:57:57.400]  sale. It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food. They're
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:02.520]  going to find at infowarstore.com. The subsection is prepared with alex.com. And it's all these
[1:58:02.520 --> 1:58:07.320]  globalists do this. And as they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you
[1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:12.760]  need 25 year food supply at the last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year supplies,
[1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:16.680]  and it's the highest quality you're going to find. And it's just good to have that checkbox
[1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:20.600]  taken care of. And you know, you're getting good food at a very good price. And you know that a
[1:58:20.600 --> 1:58:25.000]  small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:30.360]  So prepare alex.com or infowarstore.com. You can find prepare in this section there,
[1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:34.360]  water filtration, air filtration. It's all there. The technocrats are getting ready to bring in
[1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:38.200]  all the force GMO and more. It's time to start getting prepared. It starts with self defense.
[1:58:38.200 --> 1:58:42.040]  It starts with being prepared. It starts with horrible food. It starts with digging into the
[1:58:42.040 --> 1:58:51.400]  long globalist fight. You'll win in the end. In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie that
[1:58:51.400 --> 1:59:00.520]  came out called Wayne's World. Even before I had access to your show in the mid 1990s,
[1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:05.560]  I wouldn't call that movie and thought, man, that was fun. In fact, you speak out, have your own
[1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:09.800]  ideas. And even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real. Well, what
[1:59:09.800 --> 1:59:16.440]  do they say in Wayne's World? We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Every day when I cover these
[1:59:16.440 --> 1:59:20.760]  huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge are so real.
[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:24.200]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right. And most of the time we do.
[1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:29.880]  The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity.
[1:59:29.880 --> 1:59:35.480]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them. That for me is really
[1:59:35.480 --> 1:59:40.360]  such a disgusting. So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole Info Wars crew
[1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:45.880]  that we will never join the globalists. We will never knowingly manipulate you
[1:59:45.880 --> 1:59:47.240]  because we know we're all in this together.
[1:59:47.240 --> 1:59:53.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:02.920 --> 2:00:07.080]  All right, welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Blackpilling everybody just because we hope
[2:00:07.080 --> 2:00:11.000]  turned things around with Trump. We fought hard. I told you how much desperate trouble he was in.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:17.400]  But CIA psych warfare operation with Q is just too powerful. They hit us too hard.
[2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:20.680]  So it's people stood down and now we're going to get hurt really, really bad.
[2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:25.320]  I'm going to go to break here in a few minutes. This is a short segment. Come back and take calls.
[2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:28.920]  I've got a lot of other clips I haven't gotten to Mark Zuckerberg admitting that oh,
[2:00:28.920 --> 2:00:32.120]  don't take the vaccine. It's dangerous. I mean, just incredible stuff.
[2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:35.320]  By the way, he knew all this was going to get leaked that they had their employees leaked this
[2:00:35.320 --> 2:00:41.960]  stuff. There's a PR campaign to cover his ass. Let's full spectrum dominance. I'll explain
[2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:46.280]  that again in dialectic they're using on the other side. And then, of course, go to your phone
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:55.080]  calls at 877-789-2539. But seriously, if I don't get into business of getting listeners to understand
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:00:59.160]  that we have to fund ourselves by you buying products, we won't be here.
[2:00:59.160 --> 2:01:04.200]  Or I'm going to have to lay a lot of folks off. So please listen very carefully.
[2:01:05.240 --> 2:01:11.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to decide what you're going to do in the future. Now,
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:15.320]  you've got to decide what you're going to support and who you're going to promote.
[2:01:15.960 --> 2:01:21.400]  Info wars has proven without a shadow of a doubt that we know what we're talking about,
[2:01:21.400 --> 2:01:25.800]  that we're fearless, and that we are the antidote to the globalist. But listen,
[2:01:25.800 --> 2:01:31.800]  I can't run this operation without your financial support. I can't do it. And I understand when
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:35.240]  Trump was in, it was the bandwagon effect that we were invincible and we were the Super Bowl
[2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:39.320]  champions and everything was going to be fine. I explained it was more like a beach head in
[2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:44.520]  globalist territory and that we better understand that they could either kill Trump or removing
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:49.960]  via fraud. They've now done that. Now they're shutting everybody down and moving in with rolling
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:54.520]  blackouts and moving in with the lockdowns and moving in with the race war and moving in with
[2:01:54.520 --> 2:02:00.440]  a roundup of patriots. And it's going to be more important than ever that we stay on air during
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:05.960]  this critical time. Every day we stay on air has a huge effect every week, every month. And so I'm
[2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:11.080]  committed to stay here, to stay in the US and go down with the ship because there's a chance
[2:02:11.080 --> 2:02:16.200]  we can save the ship if I stay at the helm. But I'm not fully at the helm. Neither are you.
[2:02:16.200 --> 2:02:20.280]  Together, collectively, if we raise the alarm and warn the American people, we can do it.
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:25.320]  So spread the word about the broadcast, that it's on the air at band.video and local stations.
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:30.760]  And spread the word about infowars.com and newswars.com and say, listen, this is a takeover.
[2:02:30.760 --> 2:02:36.920]  Learn the truth. Here it is. This is the guy that exposed Q as a fraud. Q was designed to
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:41.240]  grab the liberty movement, discredit it and make people no longer promote freedom.
[2:02:41.240 --> 2:02:45.880]  And it was devastatingly successful, but not completely successful. So say this is the guy
[2:02:45.880 --> 2:02:50.200]  that exposed the whole New World War first, who's been accurate, who exposed the Q thing. Because
[2:02:50.200 --> 2:02:53.800]  they're going to tell you, oh, you're a Q guy. There's no New World War. There's no pedophiles.
[2:02:53.800 --> 2:02:58.040]  There's no Chinese takeover, even though it's all happening. And so you've got to then tell them,
[2:02:58.040 --> 2:03:03.640]  hey, it's on air and you've got to financially support. Everybody needs our winter sun. Everybody
[2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:08.520]  needs our ultra 12. Everybody needs the over-the-top turbo force. People take it and say, my God,
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:10.920]  this is the strongest thing I ever took. I'm going to take a quarter packet,
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:14.600]  truck driver take a half a packet. And they've got, you know, burn on adrenals. It's like I do.
[2:03:14.600 --> 2:03:20.120]  It's over-the-top strong. It's at infowarstore.com. Chill force, vitamin
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:25.400]  mineral fusion comes back in next week. Knockout has been sold out for months.

[2:03:58.040 --> 2:04:02.040]  It's all there. We have the ultimate fish oil, the ultimate krill oil. We have the super male
[2:04:02.040 --> 2:04:07.560]  vitality. And one reason we were able to stay on air is we don't have big stockpiles of things
[2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:11.960]  anymore. And a lot of that's just the supply chain broke down. So that's why I mean, it's
[2:04:11.960 --> 2:04:16.040]  like the walls are closing in ladies and gentlemen. And I'm just not going to lie to you about any of
[2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:22.600]  it. And I don't care about my career and being on air. This is a war. And Rush Lombaugh just died.
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:25.240]  I'm not happy about that, even though I'll probably get a bunch of his radio stations.
[2:04:25.880 --> 2:04:32.040]  It's total war. We're all in this together and we need you to continue to commit, sign up for
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:36.120]  auto ship with this shaltem percent off. But you're getting deals so good on a lot of these items

[2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:14.520]  war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[2:06:14.520 --> 2:06:27.080]  We got on a hot plate in the dark studio that limited power here. And if it wasn't al dente,
[2:06:27.080 --> 2:06:33.960]  it tastes as good as restaurant fettuccine Alfredo and prepare with Alex.com. So I am sitting here
[2:06:34.600 --> 2:06:39.320]  in the studio with, you know, it's no TV wall. It takes a lot of power in Texas with the power off
[2:06:39.320 --> 2:06:45.320]  with emergency generators, barely keeping us on air. Glenn Beck's off air. So many others are
[2:06:45.320 --> 2:06:50.200]  off air right now. Stephen Crowder's house doesn't have power, but the studio does is next door
[2:06:50.200 --> 2:07:03.000]  to a hospital. And it's seen as essential. An incredible time to be alive. So that is really
[2:07:03.000 --> 2:07:09.400]  tasty. That is really delicious. So that is so good. And the storeable food and the water
[2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:13.480]  filtration is shipped out of Utah and three other facilities around the country. So they're ready
[2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:19.320]  to ship to you next day. infowarstore.com has gotten so good that unless it's the weekend,
[2:07:19.320 --> 2:07:25.480]  we ship next day. Not going to lie to you. Not now. The power is turned off at our warehouse
[2:07:25.480 --> 2:07:31.480]  because we're not Amazon. We're not Apple. We're not Google. We're not Facebook. We're not Twitter.
[2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:36.920]  We're not Walmart. We're not H.E.B. We're not Target. They're all open.
[2:07:39.320 --> 2:07:43.400]  But nobody else is because you don't have power. Oh, sorry. Well, like, why are all these restaurants
[2:07:43.400 --> 2:07:48.040]  closed? Why are all these bodegas closed? Why are all these because they're not essential?
[2:07:50.600 --> 2:07:53.480]  Everybody's wearing their little mask and going along with it. I'm going to stop
[2:07:53.480 --> 2:07:57.800]  plugging. It's just that, you know, when the shoe fits, I mean, here we are saying get your
[2:07:57.800 --> 2:08:01.400]  storeable food now while you still can. There's more and more crazy stuff is coming in the future.
[2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:05.080]  It is an absolute default. We have the best food at the best price. All right, here's the deal.
[2:08:06.600 --> 2:08:10.120]  I'm going to take calls for the rest of this hour into the next hour.
[2:08:10.120 --> 2:08:14.840]  And then John Robbaport pops in for the last 30 minutes. I have a lot of news I've not hit yet.
[2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:21.320]  I've mentioned a lot of it. But Zuckerberg in a leaked video telling his employees,
[2:08:21.320 --> 2:08:27.400]  I don't trust the vaccine. You know what all that is, right? You know, he's the aid to camp to
[2:08:27.400 --> 2:08:33.320]  Bill Gates, but he sees Bill Gates being vaporized. And look, I love Project Veritas and they're
[2:08:33.320 --> 2:08:36.920]  getting censored right now. They're good guys. They're amazing. They're the catch me now.
[2:08:38.680 --> 2:08:44.280]  But these Zuckerberg things were leaked on purpose. All this stuff about I want to work with Biden.
[2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:48.840]  And I think it is too big a responsibility that we're censoring everybody. And I just don't like
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:53.320]  doing it because he knows he's getting heat. And now he's like, I don't know about these vaccines.
[2:08:53.320 --> 2:08:57.480]  They're untested and dangerous. And I just don't know if we should be taking them as a company.
[2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:03.560]  That's all a cover story. And I told you they do this. And I told you they were going to burn
[2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:09.640]  Cuomo. I told you they were going to burn Cuomo because they want sacrificial lambs to act like
[2:09:09.640 --> 2:09:14.920]  Cuomo sent old people to die in nursing homes. Cuomo is in a torture dungeon most of the day,
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:19.960]  hanging up by his, you know, literally, that's the word. It's come out. That's what he does is,
[2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:25.000]  you know, I'm not going to get into it on air. The guy's a pervert. And so he doesn't even know
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:29.640]  what side is up. And of course, I told you, I told you six months ago, they're going to destroy
[2:09:29.640 --> 2:09:36.680]  Cuomo. They may have destroyed Newsom because they like to feed their own into the system.
[2:09:37.720 --> 2:09:43.240]  And sure enough, that's all happening as well. So we're going to break that down. But the power
[2:09:43.240 --> 2:09:48.200]  they admit was turned off in select areas on purpose because they claim it went too high.
[2:09:48.200 --> 2:09:54.200]  And now they can't turn it back on because the windmills are frozen. I talked to the engineers,
[2:09:54.200 --> 2:09:57.640]  those windmills are the same ones they've got on the coast of Spain, the same ones they got on the
[2:09:57.640 --> 2:10:02.600]  coast of Connecticut, same ones they've got. No, no, it's all lies, folks. They just turned
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:07.400]  the power off and in Ron that came up with this whole scam. And the carbon tax was the first to
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:13.960]  do it. And they got caught decades ago doing it. And I showed all that last hour. So they are
[2:10:13.960 --> 2:10:18.680]  positioning us for total collapse to sell the world the fact that America is not open for business
[2:10:18.680 --> 2:10:25.080]  and that America is over. So everybody moves to China and to other countries. This is total war.
[2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:30.920]  And only becoming aware of it gives us any future. They're going to charge you 10 times what fossil
[2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:36.920]  fuel costs on systems that don't work. And they're going to have waivers for all of their systems
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:41.720]  and their jets and their programs. This is taking cheap energy away from the general public is the
[2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:45.800]  main way you make someone poor. I'm going to explain it again. How is food inexpensive?
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:49.240]  How is medicine inexpensive? How do you get everything?
[2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:55.400]  Cheap energy. You can't do business without it. China's energy cost a third of ours. Now it's
[2:10:55.400 --> 2:11:07.240]  going up more where you cannot do business here. All right, let's go to your phone calls, ladies
[2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:14.680]  and gentlemen. We're talking to folks in Texas. I mean, that's what I called for. I see these
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:20.120]  calls from everywhere. Are you out of power? What do you think of this? What do you make of
[2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:24.360]  this experience? At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to show you Greg Abbott got an award last
[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:30.120]  week for the windmills by the globalists. Have what a good globalist he is. Oh, and Rick Perry
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:38.360]  was on Fox News this morning talking about how terrible the windmills are and how the green
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:43.560]  New Deal did this. Rick Perry is the one that got all the accolades as a good Republican,
[2:11:43.560 --> 2:11:48.520]  shutting off the coal power plants and putting in the windmills. So they think we're stupid.
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:11:52.600]  And I'm not even attacking Rick Perry. I mean, Rick Perry just did what he was told.
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:55.960]  He's not like out to get the country. It's just that he at least he's criticizing it now that
[2:11:55.960 --> 2:12:03.400]  he's not in office. But my God, this is out of control. All right, David, Paul, Jay, Randy,
[2:12:04.040 --> 2:12:13.000]  Rudy, Levi, Jeff, Adam, John, Ben, Kelsey. I'm going to go to all of you. No need to thank me.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:16.200]  No need to get right to your point. We'll move the next person we get to everybody.
[2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:21.400]  I really appreciate everybody calling in today. Let's go to Jay in Texas. Jay, thanks for holding
[2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:32.600]  you're on the air. Hello, Alex. Welcome. I'm in Deer Park. I'm a truck driver and I love your
[2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:40.040]  products. I love the turbo force. Bottom line is the power went out. I've been here since Saturday
[2:12:40.040 --> 2:12:45.000]  and really I got an electric scooter. So I got out on the electric scooter on the ice.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:51.880]  Wow. And I found they got barriers out there. So you can't get on 225 and you can't get over to
[2:12:51.880 --> 2:12:58.040]  10 and get out of here. And the power was often at the love of truck trucks. We couldn't even go
[2:12:58.040 --> 2:13:02.360]  in there. Let's explain that. Let's explain that. They just have closed most of the highways.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:07.160]  A lot of our employees crew members can't get here because they just closed the roads.
[2:13:08.120 --> 2:13:13.880]  Yeah. And you'll get a ticket. And the roads don't even look bad. I went up on top of the
[2:13:13.880 --> 2:13:20.280]  overpass to look at 225 and it looks as clear as it was in a helicopter yesterday and most of the
[2:13:20.280 --> 2:13:28.200]  roads are completely clear. They're just locking us down. It's retarded. I mean, I got I got a
[2:13:28.200 --> 2:13:35.080]  bunch of those barrels of food that from the Patriots there at my house. And it's I'm kicking
[2:13:35.080 --> 2:13:40.360]  myself in the ass for not carrying one in the truck because I usually do my shopping about once a
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:46.280]  week. And I I'm only three miles from Walmart. And because of the electronic log, I don't want
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:52.280]  to drive over there and stop by moving my clock, which at this point now, it doesn't matter anymore.
[2:13:52.280 --> 2:14:01.080]  I lost my load. But it's not even open over there. And you can't get in there. And so now the water
[2:14:01.080 --> 2:14:06.920]  is out. You can't use the toilet inside the truck drivers know how to take care of the business,
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:14.680]  what they got to do, you got to do. But it sucks. I mean, I hate to I've been listening to you for
[2:14:14.680 --> 2:14:19.960]  probably 12 years, in all honesty. And yeah, you sounded a little off for a little while,
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:23.720]  but you're not off. I mean, you're totally we were on point. And it's not in it just
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:28.440]  I want to scream I want to yell I want to go I didn't want to come on here and tell people
[2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:34.680]  Trump was surrounded. I mean, I met with people high level US intelligence in DC three years ago
[2:14:34.680 --> 2:14:38.120]  who claimed their conservatives. And they were talking crap about Trump to me. And I thought
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:42.520]  it was a loyalty test. And it wasn't they were trying to recruit me against Trump. He is surrounded
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:46.520]  by enemies. He was so I didn't want to sound like a negative person. Is that what you're saying?
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:51.400]  I sounded lost or what did you think I was full of it maybe? No, I never thought you were full
[2:14:51.400 --> 2:14:59.080]  of it. What you know, everything that you've said over the years in that show the end game is it
[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:03.640]  just sounded really out there, something that was never going to happen in my life. But it's
[2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:09.800]  everything that has happened in my life. I mean, I've worked real hard. I'm 56 years old. Everything
[2:15:09.800 --> 2:15:14.280]  that's paid for the house and the cars and everything and life is good. I got money in the bank.
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:19.160]  And that today I just I had my wife send some money off to buy some more gold and silver.
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:24.120]  I'm a little afraid of the Bitcoin. But I guess I got it. I'm just worried about you because
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:27.720]  they're talking about keeping things locked down for another week. Again, they're using this to
[2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:31.640]  train us to live under martial law to bankrupt the economy and to show us looking like a bunch of
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:37.000]  idiots. They put Biden look like a joke. Kind of rags they control him. It's about humiliating us.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:41.640]  Don't let them break your morale. Admit how much trouble you're in and decide we can only come up
[2:15:41.640 --> 2:15:45.640]  from here and we're going to fight back in the info war. God bless your brother. Good to have you
[2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:49.960]  on board for 12 years. Hope there's another 12, but I'm not sure. We're all in deep trouble. We
[2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:56.760]  are afraid of Jesus. We'll be right back with more calls. Attention radio listeners, if you're
[2:15:56.760 --> 2:16:02.360]  concerned about the coming chaos after the November elections, this will be an extremely
[2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:08.520]  important message. Here's why. No matter what the outcome in November, catastrophic social upheaval
[2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:14.520]  is a very real possibility. Here's why this is important. Listen, we all know that silver and
[2:16:14.520 --> 2:16:20.280]  gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain waves of social chaos and unstable
[2:16:20.280 --> 2:16:25.960]  currencies. But did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:31.880]  when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold? It's true. Open pollinated
[2:16:31.880 --> 2:16:37.640]  seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value in the coming hard times ahead.

[2:19:01.320 --> 2:19:09.480]  With millions left without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left
[2:19:09.480 --> 2:19:16.760]  without food. The lines that the grocery stores are getting longer and longer while most of the
[2:19:16.760 --> 2:19:25.320]  store shelves are left bare. Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures
[2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:32.600]  in over a century, your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat and turn off
[2:19:32.600 --> 2:19:39.480]  the water. Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.

[2:19:54.440 --> 2:20:02.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:25.400 --> 2:20:34.200]  I'm here for Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. Yeah, she's getting closer.
[2:20:41.320 --> 2:20:42.200]  You're gonna have to take it.
[2:20:45.720 --> 2:20:49.560]  Don't let the globalists oppress you. This is war. Push back and get strong.
[2:20:49.560 --> 2:20:56.760]  Let's go ahead and take phone calls. But just remember, Alex Jones, you're back live.
[2:20:58.600 --> 2:21:07.240]  We remember that our grandpas and grandmas and other people warned us about this when I was growing
[2:21:07.240 --> 2:21:13.480]  up. The naked communists, the naked capitalists were on the bookstore shelves at my grandmother's
[2:21:13.480 --> 2:21:24.600]  house, my father's, father's house, Cleonskousen. Guys, look up on the naked communists was written
[2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:33.880]  by Cleonskousen. Late 50s, early 60s. All of it came true. So we've known who bit up against this
[2:21:33.880 --> 2:21:40.280]  whole time. They tried to take over in the 60s. It failed. They funded that whole cultural revolution.
[2:21:40.280 --> 2:21:45.880]  They did the Vietnam War, had us losing on purpose, that's all declassified. It's all a big war game,
[2:21:45.880 --> 2:21:54.920]  all a big test. 1958. Yeah, remember that same red cover.
[2:21:59.640 --> 2:22:03.560]  All right, Levi, in Texas, thanks for holding here on the air.
[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:08.920]  What's your view on this whole situation? All right, thank you, Alex.
[2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:16.200]  Look, I just wanted to say, okay, that what's it going to take for the people of this country to
[2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:23.320]  wake up? Your nation is judged and you have been found wanting. And I've got information for you,
[2:22:23.320 --> 2:22:28.680]  Alex, that is imperative. I can't get into it, over the line, but I'm going to tell you right now
[2:22:28.680 --> 2:22:37.480]  that there are 360 million lives at stake right now. And all I'm asking for you is 15 minutes of your
[2:22:37.480 --> 2:22:44.120]  time. If I give you this information and you hear it, you'll know it's the truth. And it's going to
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:49.640]  answer a lot of questions that you have had that you have not been able to get answers to. I'm a man
[2:22:49.640 --> 2:22:54.600]  of God. I'm a prophet of God. All right, brother, listen, I'll get your info. But I mean, here's the
[2:22:54.600 --> 2:22:58.920]  deal. Everybody always used to talk to me privately. I don't know why we can't. You've got a point
[2:22:58.920 --> 2:23:03.800]  to make it on air, but I hear you. I think this is his judgment. And God is letting these evil
[2:23:03.800 --> 2:23:07.960]  people do this to us because that's their nature and they can't help it. They want to bankrupt.
[2:23:07.960 --> 2:23:12.040]  They want to steal. They're making huge profits under the lockdown. They've doubled their profits.
[2:23:12.040 --> 2:23:16.760]  Now they're going to triple their profits even more. They turn the power off. They admit they
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:21.880]  turned the power off. Now they say they can't turn it back on. It's all BS, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:23:21.880 --> 2:23:28.440]  It's all BS. They turned it off by shutting down over 100, 120-something power plants in the US
[2:23:28.440 --> 2:23:32.520]  under Obama. Trump only got a couple of them reopened because people knew that Trump wouldn't
[2:23:32.520 --> 2:23:36.120]  be there long. And so they're like, we're not going to rebuild or turn all these things on when
[2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:41.880]  it costs hundreds of millions of dollars just to turn one back on. And so I watched the city of
[2:23:41.880 --> 2:23:48.200]  Austin shut down three giant modern coal plants that are totally clean. I appreciate you put them
[2:23:48.200 --> 2:23:51.640]  on hold and get his info and see what he's talking about. And if it's some kind of intel,
[2:23:51.640 --> 2:23:55.320]  then I'll do it. But if it's like some, you know, word from God or whatever, he seems to do it on
[2:23:55.320 --> 2:24:00.520]  air. Look, and I'm not pooping what you're saying, sir. I just, I have to run around here like a
[2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:05.000]  chicken with my head cut off. And I got to make sure food gets here for the crew. And I'm in there
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:10.680]  on a hot plate cooking up my Patriots supply food. Okay. So I'm not complaining. I'm just saying
[2:24:11.480 --> 2:24:18.040]  I'm literally, you know, don't know what my wife's doing at home with the power off and no water.
[2:24:18.600 --> 2:24:22.680]  I don't know what she's not answering the phone. It's just there's a lot of stuff going on here.
[2:24:22.680 --> 2:24:27.080]  And so I'm just here explaining what's going on and how dependent they've got us. Now we're off
[2:24:27.080 --> 2:24:32.520]  the land now. And now they say they're going to exploit that and use that till we're so bankrupt.
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:37.880]  We live in 250 square foot coffin apartments with communists and socialists minding us and
[2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:43.000]  controlling everything we do. That's their plan to bankrupt you to live in a communal
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:48.440]  coffin apartment where you live in a coffin. And then everybody spies on you tracks you,
[2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:53.720]  fries you with 5g inside the buildings, feeds you GMOs, makes you take dozens of vaccines a year
[2:24:53.720 --> 2:24:59.720]  until you die. I mean, it is a, it is a freaking dystopia. People are like, he's crazy. Why is
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:06.920]  it coming true? They all wrote about it. It's a damn plan, people. They're not playing games.
[2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:13.560]  Let's go to the next caller, Adam and Wichita Falls, Texas. Or is that Wichita Falls, falls,
[2:25:13.560 --> 2:25:17.080]  Kansas? I don't know. You're on the air from Wichita Falls. Is that Texas, Adam?
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:20.600]  That is Texas, Alex. All right, brothers. So tell me your view on this.
[2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:27.400]  Well, I'm out here and yeah, we've been, we've been hit with the weather storm just like anybody,
[2:25:27.400 --> 2:25:35.080]  you know, powers out in various places. And I just recently moved. I stay in an area that is,
[2:25:35.080 --> 2:25:38.920]  it's pretty nice. It's really rich. I mean, there's a lot of two-story houses out here,
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:43.720]  you know, and I'm like, I'm just grateful to have a new place. But then I'm hearing with
[2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:48.200]  everybody like, you know, in places where I don't know, it's just not as well off. You know what I'm
[2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:53.160]  saying? The sunny side, just places that just would be a little more rundown, but they're
[2:25:53.160 --> 2:25:57.160]  completely without power. They don't have any power. And I expect that in something like this,
[2:25:57.160 --> 2:26:00.920]  maybe they'll last a day or two, you know, but to be going for this long, you know,
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:03.800]  and you got family members calling and they're saying that we ain't got power. We didn't
[2:26:03.800 --> 2:26:07.560]  got water. It's always the same psychology. Oh, it'll be back on a day, back on a three,
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:12.680]  back in a week, back in two. Now the White House says the mass never come off. The lockdown never
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:16.520]  stops. And they're going to do it one way or another because America is being under sanctions
[2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:22.280]  for Trump reversing a bunch of Chinese deals. So we are to be punished and kept close one way
[2:26:22.280 --> 2:26:28.120]  or another. And they're doing it to us right now. Yeah. And this is humiliation for Xi Jinping to
[2:26:28.120 --> 2:26:33.080]  watch this and enjoy this. What do you think of Biden going on TV and saying China can invade
[2:26:33.080 --> 2:26:39.560]  Hong Kong and China can put people in death camps? Yeah, you know, honestly, man, I have not kept up
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:43.880]  with you that much than the past few days, because I've been so focused on what's going on here.
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:48.200]  I don't agree with it, but I've been following you for years. You know, I learned about you
[2:26:48.200 --> 2:26:52.600]  originally on a radio show called Coast to Coast. I love Coast to Coast. I need to get back on
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:56.440]  Coast to Coast. I've been on there an over a year and a half. Yeah, I did have a phone out with
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:27:00.760]  George Norrie. I've just been so busy and a couple of times I was supposed to be on and fell asleep.
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:04.600]  I think I pissed off George Norrie. So I apologize. But I mean, that's the thing. All right,
[2:27:04.600 --> 2:27:07.640]  God bless you. I wasn't trying to bring myself up, sir. I was I was asking
[2:27:07.640 --> 2:27:13.480]  what you think or did you hear that Joe Biden endorsed Chinese death camps?
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:19.640]  But I thought it was pretty interesting that the clip you just showed where the guy talks about
[2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:25.320]  aerosoling in spring, the atmosphere, and people have been saying that Kim Troll has been going
[2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:30.280]  on for years and now they just openly admitted it on a live world public forum. But again,
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:33.240]  they talked to us like we're children. That doesn't exist. That's not happening,
[2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:37.960]  sweetie cake and control the weather. But we can't let the public know on TV. They're saying
[2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:41.960]  I appreciate your call, brother. Thank you. Hey, can I give you a thing for a go? Go ahead.
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:47.480]  Okay, so one thing that I've followed just as much as I followed you for years is the Philadelphia
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:51.640]  Church of God. And I just want to highly recommend that either you or somebody that's in your
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:56.280]  organization to research this and listen to this and hear what they have to say because they've
[2:27:56.280 --> 2:28:00.920]  been spot on just as much as you. So if anybody is any whether it's you or somebody else could
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:05.560]  take the time to look at this, I think it'll really help you as well. Philadelphia Church of God.
[2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:12.920]  I watch preachers all the time. And my wife's like, why are you always watching black preachers?
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:16.120]  I go, maybe I was a black preacher in other lives. I don't believe in reincarnation. I was just a
[2:28:16.120 --> 2:28:20.520]  joke. She's like, I was a bit savvy. And then the other day was black preacher, Brandon Ravens.
[2:28:20.520 --> 2:28:24.520]  He's like, what's going on? Like, I was some black preacher. They're talking about, you know,
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:28.440]  how we're going under judgment and the rest of it. I forget his name. All right, we're going to be
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:35.480]  right back. How about black preachers copy me? We'll be right back on the other side of this
[2:28:35.480 --> 2:28:39.800]  break. And we'll go to your phone calls. We've got a bunch of people that are patiently holding
[2:28:39.800 --> 2:28:44.680]  Rudy and David and Paul and Randy and John and Kelsey and we're going to get to everybody,
[2:28:44.680 --> 2:28:48.600]  but just be ready. Bam, bam, bam. When we come back and I'm sorry, I'd say all this horrible
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:52.760]  stuff, but I mean, don't don't you want to know? I'm telling you, I got a bad feeling, the worst
[2:28:52.760 --> 2:29:00.280]  feeling ever. I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off. The
[2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:06.120]  success is simple versus that. If you're paying attention, you know we've done together. But
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:13.800]  I'll tell you this. The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all
[2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:19.560]  independent forms of media. They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance. So now is
[2:29:19.560 --> 2:29:24.360]  the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate. Everything you
[2:29:24.360 --> 2:29:28.760]  warned your friends and family about us are going to be true. So it's now that your credibility is
[2:29:28.760 --> 2:29:35.560]  way up. The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't. But it's up to all of us
[2:29:36.200 --> 2:29:42.920]  to not let them silence any of us. We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and
[2:29:42.920 --> 2:29:48.600]  setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long
[2:29:48.600 --> 2:29:51.720]  dark night doesn't come. So be the polar bears you are.
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:30:05.320]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[2:30:06.520 --> 2:30:14.520]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date. Super male vitality, specifically

[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:07.480]  to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought down to nothing. All of you
[2:31:07.480 --> 2:31:13.000]  that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team. You're about to find out how
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:21.080]  pathetic you are. So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[2:31:22.200 --> 2:31:28.680]  The enemy is about to expose itself. The enemy can't help itself. The enemy comes to kill,
[2:31:29.240 --> 2:31:35.960]  steal and destroy. We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it. We should,
[2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:42.680]  but once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[2:31:42.680 --> 2:31:49.480]  us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it. So prepare yourselves, America. You're going
[2:31:49.480 --> 2:31:55.480]  under a judge but just like all the children that were aborted. This is the truth. This is the info
[2:31:55.480 --> 2:32:03.080]  war. I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee. I just love it. I can't get enough of it.

[2:32:40.840 --> 2:32:45.320]  thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody
[2:32:45.320 --> 2:32:49.000]  gets a five star. So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody gives it a five star,
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:56.280]  except maybe one or two people. Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available at infowarsstore.com.
[2:32:56.280 --> 2:33:12.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:20.120]  Look, you know what it's like to read all the global
[2:33:20.120 --> 2:33:24.840]  documents that know it's true and other gonna do this and now it's happening and then I know what's
[2:33:24.840 --> 2:33:28.600]  going to happen next. I don't know exactly when they're going to do it, but they've already laid all
[2:33:28.600 --> 2:33:36.520]  this out. And I'm mad about it. And I just look at all the corporate yes men and all the governors
[2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:42.440]  and legislatures that sit there like dumb fools. I mean, the US Senate is still going, we're going
[2:33:42.440 --> 2:33:49.320]  to have a hearing to see if there is censorship. And then meanwhile, they're like, we're going to
[2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:53.080]  shut every American down that questions us. We're going to reeducate them. We're going to arrest
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:34:04.040]  them. We're going to take their guns to slash Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Josh Holly, who I think
[2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:08.440]  are good guys is why they want them to resign and step down. They're coming after them. They all know
[2:34:08.440 --> 2:34:15.080]  everything I know and more. And by the way, behind the scenes with these people, they're just like,
[2:34:15.080 --> 2:34:19.720]  oh, Alex Jones, you're absolutely right about everything. And they all listen. And I'm not
[2:34:19.720 --> 2:34:24.680]  outing them or getting them in trouble. It's just that they all, there's just as smart as I am,
[2:34:25.320 --> 2:34:31.640]  probably smarter. They're smart. Ted Cruz especially, but so is Rand Paul. They're up there.
[2:34:32.760 --> 2:34:37.400]  About as smart as you can get. And they're not out to destroy the country. Well, they better get
[2:34:37.400 --> 2:34:43.880]  on their damn horse and lead us. Because a new old order was worried about me being a leader. I
[2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:49.160]  never tried to be one, but they assassinated my character to enough people. And I've done a lot
[2:34:49.160 --> 2:34:56.120]  of wild stuff too, that I am not statesman like enough. We need statesmen to lead us out of this.
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:35:01.640]  And they need to pray to God publicly and ask for God to, to, to, to, to anoint them
[2:35:04.120 --> 2:35:08.280]  to do this job. Because you can only do this if you have God on your side. And again,
[2:35:09.160 --> 2:35:12.280]  I'm not up here on some high horse like I'm the perfect person.
[2:35:12.280 --> 2:35:20.840]  I know this, I'm not out to get humanity. I mean, I like to beat the hell out of people. They
[2:35:20.840 --> 2:35:26.280]  try to fight with me. That's not Christian. I like to, you know, I'm a lustful person too.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:31.080]  I'd like with God's finest creation women. But at the end of the day, I love humanity. See,
[2:35:31.640 --> 2:35:35.160]  and I'm not here trying to screw people over. And so I'm going to go to your phone calls right now.
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:40.600]  I'm just telling you, this is it. This is the big globalist move. This is the new world order.
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:46.360]  This is every level you can imagine. Joe Biden endorsing death camps in China and the invasion
[2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:51.960]  of Hong Kong and, and, and sake saying, Oh, he won't be seen for months now. I mean,
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:36:00.440]  I've got the clips. These people are out of control. Biden dismisses China's Uyghur genocide as
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:08.600]  different cultural norm. All right, I'm going to rattle through your calls quick here. Who's
[2:36:08.600 --> 2:36:15.480]  been on the longest now? Let's talk to David in Texas. Thanks for holding David. You are on the
[2:36:15.480 --> 2:36:22.360]  air. We'll go to Rudy. Hey, Alex, what's up? Man, I just totally freaked out. It's, it's going to
[2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:28.280]  just get worse from here on out. Hey, hey, hey, chill, chill, chill. Remember, remember, Alex,
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:32.840]  half the people in America are under 30 years old. That's older guys. We've been through all this
[2:36:32.840 --> 2:36:39.400]  stuff. And you need to go out and get Biden and mineral fusion in the next two. But I got, you
[2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:45.720]  know, ever since the bullets ran out back to 2012, my power has stayed on here because we're on
[2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:51.960]  Denton County co-op. My, my in-laws, they're on, on corn, whatever. They have to, they're bailed in
[2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:56.280]  here with me for the last three days. They're all freaked out because they're big old Biden vote
[2:36:56.280 --> 2:37:03.240]  liberals. And I've said here, reloading 44 Magnum stuff, get, get all my bullets lined up and
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:06.280]  everything. They'll probably report you. They'll probably, they'll probably, they'll probably,
[2:37:06.280 --> 2:37:09.320]  they're liberals are probably robbing, killing, take your house. I'm sorry. They're probably not
[2:37:09.320 --> 2:37:12.680]  that bad, but here's the deal. They will later when there's less resources. Do they realize that
[2:37:12.680 --> 2:37:16.840]  they're King, God, Biden and Obama cut our coal power off? That's why they don't have power.
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:21.880]  Are you educating them? Yeah, I've been showing them the article. I said, you know,
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:26.680]  and we got two more coal plants here in Texas, East Texas is fixed to be cut off in the next year or
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:32.200]  so. And I told them, I said, geothermal 12 foot down in the ground, right here in Carrollton,
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:36.200]  it's 64 degrees. All you got to do is drill some holes, put some copper pipes in there,
[2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:41.480]  and you got your heat, your cooling. It's no big deal, y'all. I'm a Kansas country boy. We,
[2:37:41.480 --> 2:37:45.400]  we've been through all this. I said, don't be skits down about all this. And for those that
[2:37:45.400 --> 2:37:51.080]  don't know, we got more lignite than China does in East Texas. It's all there right under the
[2:37:51.080 --> 2:37:55.640]  surface, good coal. And yeah, they're shutting all those babies down that you supply all the
[2:37:55.640 --> 2:38:02.760]  surrounding states. These liberals don't know it. Then the jet stream brings all China's crap in
[2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:07.800]  and throws it right down here on Texas. And we have to breathe it. But, but they're finally
[2:38:07.800 --> 2:38:13.320]  starting to realize that and now living with me thinking I was crazy, having 12 propane,
[2:38:13.320 --> 2:38:17.640]  you know, 100, 100 pound propane tanks and all these heaters and food and everything else.
[2:38:17.640 --> 2:38:23.320]  Well, they don't think I'm so crazy right now. But hey, Godspeed to Rush Limbaugh
[2:38:23.320 --> 2:38:27.480]  and may Jesus send His angels protect info wars of your family.
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:31.320]  You too, brother. What a great call. God bless you and thank you, David, for holding, listening to me.
[2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:38.600]  I just wish we could wake all these people, but this doesn't have to happen. People are just
[2:38:38.600 --> 2:38:43.800]  throwing away the country, throwing away prosperity, throwing away God, throwing away our children
[2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:51.080]  on Hollywood, because they tell us to screw them. Man, I don't even watch Hollywood movies
[2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:56.360]  ever anymore. I don't, I just, I don't want any of it. I just, I hate them. God, I hate them.
[2:38:57.240 --> 2:39:02.840]  They're just scum. They know we hate them. They want to make us miserable. This is all,
[2:39:02.840 --> 2:39:07.720]  these people make me sick. I'm explaining to you, they turned the power off on purpose.
[2:39:07.720 --> 2:39:11.000]  It's all admitted. I showed it all last hour. It's all staged.
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:14.920]  Nobody's at the ERCOT place down the road from me. I'm going to go there and protest tomorrow.
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:20.280]  None of this is going on. I mean, this is just total power to test us and see what happens.
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:22.840]  Rudy in South Texas, how are you doing?
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:32.680]  Going on over 60 hours of no power. And, you know, I got a one year old, one year old.
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:39.320]  And it's cold, man. It's cold. Not very happy right now. I wish people had the same type of
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:45.400]  energy to want to investigate what's going on as, you know, put that type of energy into
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:49.400]  the investigation of the stolen election, but that's not going to happen. It's kind of too late.
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:52.680]  Oh, you're not allowed to say that. That's terrorism, the question, the election.
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:56.840]  Oh, oh, Biden really got more votes than anyone in history. He's so popular.
[2:39:58.280 --> 2:40:01.480]  You know, the, the people down in this area, they're
[2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:06.840]  built without water. I mean, it's probably, it's all over text, to be honest with you.
[2:40:06.840 --> 2:40:10.920]  I'm literally five minutes away from the border. We still got illegals flooding in over here,
[2:40:10.920 --> 2:40:15.000]  but guess what? They have light, they have water, they got heat, they got three squares a day.
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:20.200]  And that's because they got beautiful, they got beautiful coal, as Trump would say, beautiful
[2:40:20.200 --> 2:40:26.360]  coal. Burns clean, burns pure, burns straight, never goes out, never runs out. We're just sitting
[2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:32.040]  on top of a planted a coal and boy, Mexico built all those new plants. They got cheap energy in
[2:40:32.040 --> 2:40:38.200]  there, ready to start your factory. So, you know, about the, the head of Ercott,
[2:40:38.200 --> 2:40:42.920]  Sally Colbert, she doesn't even live in Texas. She's from Michigan. She's a Governor Gretchen
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:49.080]  Whitmer appointee. I knew that Ercott was a globalist company. We're looking into them,
[2:40:49.080 --> 2:40:54.680]  but no, I did not know that. Tell us more about this witch. Yeah. She is a Gretchen Whitmer
[2:40:54.680 --> 2:41:00.200]  appointee. She was, she was a head of the environmental, environmental services
[2:41:00.200 --> 2:41:05.640]  in Michigan. You know, the whole Flint water disaster. Oh, yeah, I've heard of her. Oh,
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:09.800]  but is it, oh, but they gave the governor a reward for the windmills. Isn't that good?
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:15.880]  Ridiculous, man. It's ridiculous. Disgusted, utterly disgusted with the,
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:19.960]  with the way this country is headed, man. Yeah. Tell me that piglet's name again,
[2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:23.560]  because I want to look her up. It's Sally Talberg.
[2:41:23.560 --> 2:41:32.360]  Talberg? No, Talberg, T-A-L-L-B-E-R-G. Yep. Well, I'm going to be paying them a little friendly
[2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:37.560]  visit tomorrow protesting. We're going to be announcing that sometime today, because it's
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:42.040]  right here in Austin, Texas. And yeah, they control the whole grid and they just decide who's essential,
[2:41:42.040 --> 2:41:47.000]  who isn't, and they're teaching us, oh, your family grown, your family grocery store is not
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:55.880]  essential, but your big Walmart is. See how that works? Do you have any input on the
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:02.200]  Biden opening up the power grid to China? They couldn't even answer the question
[2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:08.760]  the other day. They're going to circle back to it. Oh, yeah, she said, Saki. Saki said,
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:12.920]  she said, I'm not going to answer that question about China taking over the power grid. Oh,
[2:42:12.920 --> 2:42:16.440]  it's no big deal. They're just saying they're going to nuke us and attack us any day and that they may
[2:42:16.440 --> 2:42:21.400]  have that. And then what do you make of Biden actually groveling and saying you're allowed to
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:27.400]  attack Hong Kong? We love death camps. It's a disgusting and people don't say anything about it
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:32.040]  because they're not being shown that, you know, mainstream media does a great job of covering
[2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:36.840]  up big tech social media. She smiles and goes, but we're putting women in positions of power
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:40.360]  in and we're going to give free money to black people. Yeah, if you kill them with a vaccine,
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:46.360]  you're lying, bucktooth, raggedy and piece of crap. Excuse me, folks. I shouldn't even be on air. I'm so
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:51.800]  pissed right now. We'll be right back as the new dark ages are here. Stay with us. Thank you, Paul.
[2:42:51.800 --> 2:43:00.600]  Thank you, Rudy. I sell supplements for two reasons because they work. They're real. They're
[2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:06.520]  powerful. And because it's a giant market. But again, why is there a giant market? Because it
[2:43:06.520 --> 2:43:12.520]  works. That's why it exponentially grows. So whether it's saw palm Meadow and other key ingredients
[2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:20.600]  in our prostate formula, prostaguard, or whether it is the super high grade or panic
[2:43:20.600 --> 2:43:26.200]  bottom of the B12 and ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ of the CoQ 10 in DNA force,
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:33.080]  or the pure deep breath crystal iodide on an X2. These are all the very best supplements you're
[2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:39.000]  going to find in already great market of high quality products out there. And it funds the
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:43.240]  info war. So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're fun of the info
[2:43:43.240 --> 2:43:49.000]  wars. You can't lose info wars delivers in space. Please visit info war store.com and get the
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:53.960]  products today. Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at infowarstore.com.
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:44:01.240]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:09.960]  that this is all a test. This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning. It's God
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:15.240]  giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension. So we can decide where we want to
[2:44:15.240 --> 2:44:19.960]  spend eternity and what level we want to go to. And it really does come down to that. So
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:24.600]  as saddest things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and
[2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:32.120]  realize that God is the author of our consciousness. God is the author of us having our own will. God
[2:44:32.120 --> 2:44:38.600]  is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing. When you look at
[2:44:38.600 --> 2:44:44.440]  mainstream media in Hollywood, this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass
[2:44:44.440 --> 2:44:49.240]  cult, it's all about dominating your free will. It's all about telling you your dirty, your ugly,
[2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:53.880]  your bad, because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the
[2:44:53.880 --> 2:45:02.600]  universe. I knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking
[2:45:02.600 --> 2:45:09.880]  agents of the enemy. A lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like, oh no, it's 3G chest,
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:14.200]  5G chest, he's invincible. And I understand why people wanted to believe that because this is
[2:45:14.200 --> 2:45:18.280]  scary what's going on. The global government and the New World Order. Now that people woke up
[2:45:18.280 --> 2:45:23.080]  to the fact that's real, they want somebody to come save them from. Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[2:45:23.080 --> 2:45:27.640]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug
[2:45:27.640 --> 2:45:31.720]  once you buy it and sign that executive order. We pay the most of anybody in the world. That's just
[2:45:31.720 --> 2:45:35.880]  one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed and now people are going to feel
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:41.320]  the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else. But what's really illustrated this is the
[2:45:41.320 --> 2:45:46.440]  trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he
[2:45:46.440 --> 2:45:52.200]  lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in, folks.
[2:45:52.200 --> 2:45:55.640]  The swamp is deep. Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:03.000]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:08.280]  you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God
[2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:13.640]  and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will. Being given free will,
[2:46:13.640 --> 2:46:21.000]  being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system. And the
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:24.600]  fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:29.320]  sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your wife or your husband or the
[2:46:29.320 --> 2:46:34.600]  beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:41.400]  that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[2:46:41.400 --> 2:46:46.280]  So don't worship the globalist. Don't worship the NFL. Don't worship all the things in the system,
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:51.480]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:55.000]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[2:46:59.080 --> 2:47:01.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:01.720 --> 2:47:21.000]  It was 20 years ago or so, but I got a contact from the Air Force and they said the director of
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:26.120]  Hart, the civilian head, would like to come on the show because he heard General Benton K.
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:33.160]  Parton, the military head of Hart, previously on your show. Talk about it. And sure enough,
[2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:36.520]  it was an Air Force Colonel on the line. They put the civilian head of it on. I look up,
[2:47:36.520 --> 2:47:40.840]  it's the real guy. He came on about a week after the Air Force called me, but when he admitted
[2:47:40.840 --> 2:47:45.080]  that they could control the weather, they could actually ignite the upper atmosphere on fire
[2:47:46.120 --> 2:47:51.640]  and steer the Arctic blast south if they wanted to.
[2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:57.000]  The Air Force guy got real mad, got on the line and said the interview is over during
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:01.240]  the break and hung up on me. And I've never been able to find that interview. It was a big
[2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:07.000]  interview. It was crazy that the military wanted to come on my show. It's just one of those bizarre
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:13.240]  things. And there's that interview, but yes, they can sit there with the Alaska system that's also
[2:48:13.240 --> 2:48:17.720]  meant to be over the horizon radar, where they ionize the atmosphere, and then they're able
[2:48:17.720 --> 2:48:23.320]  to bounce signals off of that and see fighters over the horizon. That's the supposed one use
[2:48:23.320 --> 2:48:29.240]  of it. And they have those patents. And Parton said that's what it was for. But when it comes
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:32.840]  to weather modification, they can absolutely do it and they admit it. But they talk to you like
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:36.280]  you're five years old and say, oh, no, that doesn't exist, even though it's in all the literature.
[2:48:36.280 --> 2:48:40.920]  It's in the Smithsonian. It's in the Journal of Nature. It's in science. They have C-span
[2:48:40.920 --> 2:48:45.320]  symposiums about it. And if you're for weather modification, oh, then it's great and it's good.
[2:48:45.320 --> 2:48:49.800]  Here's a Nobel Prize. But if you say, hey, I don't want that or let us know the details, oh,
[2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:57.960]  I'm sorry, it doesn't exist. And they just play that game. But they have New York Times articles
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:02.680]  going, there's no such thing as the Great Reset, while the Deimos Group talked about it two weeks
[2:49:02.680 --> 2:49:08.600]  ago for a whole week and said they published bestselling books about it. I told people 20 years
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:12.040]  ago they're going to have synthetic meat and make you eat bugs because they said that was the plan.
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:17.480]  Oh, shut up. You're crazy. Now it's all happening because it's a plan, folks, like you go to a
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:21.560]  play and they give you a program. There's the first act, second act, third act. And you go, oh,
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:26.840]  you know, I'm watching Macbeth or you're watching whatever it is and you know it's coming up next
[2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:33.640]  because it has a program. So in one article, it's great and good. We're going to starve you
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:37.320]  to death because it's good for the earth. Oh, it doesn't exist when we like go to Congress and say,
[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:42.600]  please protect us. We're going to go back to your phone calls. But just briefly,
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:48.600]  I had an idea. I called my patriot that is preparewithallux.com. Get the very best deals.
[2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:51.880]  They're full catalog. They're in our back-end daily. They take the orders. They drop ship.
[2:49:51.880 --> 2:49:55.160]  So even though Texas is shut down, our main warehouse won't be able to ship stuff out until
[2:49:55.160 --> 2:50:00.520]  next week or who knows when. We're not essential. We're not Walmart. But my patriot has four
[2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:04.360]  locations across the country. And we have to all load my stuff up in an 18-wheeler and send it to
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:09.800]  their place and ship. We've already talked about those partnerships. But you have the whole spectrum
[2:50:09.800 --> 2:50:17.400]  of their swarble food ready to ship at infowarstorm.com. That's the main umbrella site or go to
[2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:21.720]  preparewithallux.com. It takes you right to all of the high quality swarble foods,
[2:50:22.600 --> 2:50:26.840]  the Alexa pure water filtration system that's discounted. And I called them this morning.
[2:50:26.840 --> 2:50:30.440]  Speaking of the devil, they brought me some macaroni and cheese. Thank you, sir. Speak of the devil.
[2:50:30.440 --> 2:50:37.560]  They brought me some macaroni and cheese. I called them and they're going to give you
[2:50:37.560 --> 2:50:42.680]  additional 10% off. They weren't going to do specials for a long time. They hadn't done
[2:50:42.680 --> 2:50:47.960]  sales in years. They had a bunch of sales last year. This is a huge deal. We knew it was coming.
[2:50:47.960 --> 2:50:54.440]  The price of food could not last as this low rate for much longer. And now even major brands
[2:50:54.440 --> 2:51:01.000]  like Kraft Heinz, Conagra are announcing plans to start passing these soaring food costs on to you.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:06.360]  With millions of Americans nationwide becoming aware of the impact of the global pandemic
[2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:11.720]  and lockdown and forced statewide outages to our power grid, there has never been a better time
[2:51:11.720 --> 2:51:18.360]  to stock up on swarble food while you still can. In response to these outages, we are leading to
[2:51:18.360 --> 2:51:24.760]  food lines in Texas. I didn't write this. I talked to the crew about 30 minutes ago.
[2:51:26.120 --> 2:51:30.200]  And I said, please write this up. And I guess this was written hastily, so I can't really
[2:51:30.200 --> 2:51:36.440]  even understand this. But let me just tell you this, ladies and gentlemen. You need to get prepared
[2:51:36.440 --> 2:51:42.760]  now with all the craziness that's going on. You need to take action. And I would get high-quality
[2:51:42.760 --> 2:51:46.680]  swarble food right now while you still can, ready to ship to you within a day. I mean,
[2:51:46.680 --> 2:51:51.800]  they get the orders out generally within one day at super fast four locations across the country,
[2:51:51.800 --> 2:51:57.800]  ready to ship to you, swarble food, mfullwarsstore.com, 10% off. And they just brought me in this very
[2:51:57.800 --> 2:52:03.320]  distracting macaroni and cheese. And again, when you got the power out, you're going to
[2:52:03.320 --> 2:52:08.280]  mama's house to get food. My mom's got power and food and all that. This, my patriot supply,
[2:52:08.280 --> 2:52:17.400]  is incredibly delicious. Well, still one to Jennifer Macaroni, about an eight. But there,
[2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:27.400]  that cheese and Alfredo was a nine. That tastes as good as expensive box stuff at the store,
[2:52:27.400 --> 2:52:32.840]  but it's a fraction of the price. It's amazing. Okay, let's go ahead now and go back to your
[2:52:32.840 --> 2:52:38.040]  phone calls. We appreciate you holding while we cover this insane garbage. Let's talk to
[2:52:38.040 --> 2:52:42.120]  Paul in Texas. How are you dealing with this and what is your view on it?
[2:52:46.840 --> 2:52:48.760]  Yes, sir, Paul, go ahead. What is your view on all this?
[2:52:51.640 --> 2:52:54.920]  We'll put him on hold, see if he comes back. Okay, I'm gonna still put you on hold. We're
[2:52:54.920 --> 2:52:59.880]  just gonna relax and enjoy ourselves and take a few minutes here, just chill out
[2:53:00.520 --> 2:53:04.760]  and just have a really, really good day here. And then when Paul's ready, we're gonna go to him
[2:53:04.760 --> 2:53:14.680]  with a drum roll. Paul in West Texas. Thank you for holding. Welcome. Can you hear me? Yes,
[2:53:14.680 --> 2:53:22.840]  I can. Go ahead. Okay, yeah, power's been out since Sunday. No water. So it's been, oh,
[2:53:22.840 --> 2:53:28.200]  but what they did do after two days with no power, you know, like they'll turn it on for a few hours
[2:53:28.200 --> 2:53:35.080]  and they'll take it off. You know, you're not essential. So we'll give it to you when we want.
[2:53:35.240 --> 2:53:38.040]  That's what I've been experiencing with my power. I totally agree.
[2:53:39.320 --> 2:53:42.280]  What do you make of the fact that I guess the whole crew knew it? I didn't even know it. I was
[2:53:42.280 --> 2:53:48.600]  looking into ERCOT. ERCOT is just like Enron run by a bunch of Democrats. Oh, I wouldn't doubt it.
[2:53:49.160 --> 2:53:55.960]  I mean, if all the plants that we've lost, I mean, you know, there's nothing really much left,
[2:53:55.960 --> 2:54:01.320]  you know, and so it kind of makes you wonder what's going to happen next, you know,
[2:54:02.520 --> 2:54:06.520]  because if they're going to control our power like this and our family
[2:54:06.520 --> 2:54:11.560]  and their well-being when they're at home, you know, what's our next move? Like, what do we do?
[2:54:11.560 --> 2:54:14.840]  And that's, you know, those conversations we're gonna have to start having and they're messing
[2:54:14.840 --> 2:54:20.360]  around with, you know, blue collar people where I'm from Texas, born in Texas. I've worked on
[2:54:20.360 --> 2:54:25.480]  drilling rigs. I've done roofing. I've worked on generators now. I've worked on compressors, light
[2:54:25.480 --> 2:54:29.640]  towers. You're messing with the wrong people that know how to do stuff, you know how to work
[2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:33.080]  and you start, you start messing with our families. You've got something going on.
[2:54:33.720 --> 2:54:37.480]  I agree, sir. I am seriously pissed off and I've been having anger issues because
[2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:41.720]  I know they're running the scam. I know they turned off most of our plants. I know they
[2:54:41.720 --> 2:54:46.040]  fought Trump trying to reopen them and now they're going to put their foot on our neck when China
[2:54:46.040 --> 2:54:51.720]  opens three new coal plants a week. Mexico opens one every week or so. Everybody else can have power
[2:54:51.720 --> 2:54:57.480]  but us. We are slated for destruction and the average liberal is so dumb and so disconnected
[2:54:57.480 --> 2:55:02.920]  they fetishize their own destruction. Can you believe this? Oh yeah, and then, you know, that
[2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:07.320]  they're stirring up some people that they don't want to stir up and it's really, you know, they
[2:55:07.320 --> 2:55:11.720]  want that civil war. We don't want it. I'm the same. I'm a loving guy. I love, you know, I love my
[2:55:11.720 --> 2:55:17.720]  kids. I love to give and I love to eat barbecue but you start taking that away from us and then
[2:55:17.720 --> 2:55:24.920]  you're going to see a side of us you don't want. That's right. China is moving into coal. We have
[2:55:24.920 --> 2:55:31.560]  been banned and he says within four years he wants basically all coal plants silenced and so
[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:37.240]  folks, they said still 60% of our power is from coal. All the other stuff isn't reliable.
[2:55:37.240 --> 2:55:42.120]  We're literally looking at not having power anymore and the left will love it. They'll love
[2:55:42.120 --> 2:55:48.280]  being homeless. I appreciate your call. God bless you brother. Jeff, first time caller from Arkansas.
[2:55:48.280 --> 2:55:51.640]  I know you've had power outages there as well as ERCOTS all over the country.
[2:55:53.640 --> 2:55:59.400]  Break this down for us, Jeff. What's your view? Alex, I'm a 20-year listener and love the show
[2:55:59.400 --> 2:56:05.640]  but here's the thing. We live in a state that has an energy surplus. We produce more energy than we
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:12.680]  need yet we still had rolling blackouts. Not like Texas but we still did. My dad who is disabled
[2:56:12.680 --> 2:56:18.520]  paralyzed from a stroke. I'm his caregiver yesterday morning. It was eight below zero
[2:56:19.240 --> 2:56:26.360]  and here we are. There's no power. Thank God we have the wood stove and we get in there and I mean
[2:56:26.360 --> 2:56:32.280]  it's in just a matter of a couple of hours the temperature went down to 36 of course in the
[2:56:32.280 --> 2:56:39.000]  house and I'm soaking the wood stove. Thank God for that. Eight hours later the power came back on
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:43.480]  but the point that I'm trying to make is they were just saying hey look we've got the energy here
[2:56:43.480 --> 2:56:48.600]  but we're just going to show you that we can do it and I'm telling you that we have a humanitarian
[2:56:48.600 --> 2:56:54.040]  crisis in Texas and if Trump were in office right now they would be demonizing him because
[2:56:54.040 --> 2:56:58.440]  he's not sitting down aid a national guard. Well they would have never done this if Trump was in
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:57:03.800]  office. Listen, listen, Enron did this all over the world. Dictators do this with power. This is a
[2:57:03.800 --> 2:57:09.000]  move they do all the time. They did this on purpose. I have family. They used to run power plants.
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:12.360]  One of them is dead now but I've got family. I'm not going to get into it because they don't want
[2:57:12.360 --> 2:57:17.080]  me to but I called them in Houston and I called others and they said 100 percent this is all
[2:57:17.080 --> 2:57:23.080]  fake to jack-of-prices which they've now announced they're going to increase prices 10,000 percent.
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:28.760]  How's that sound buddy? Well and that's the thing I know people from Eastern Europe that lived in
[2:57:28.760 --> 2:57:34.440]  communist times and this was the norm and they're conditioning us Alex. We have only scratched
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:39.800]  the surface. Let me tell you. Stay there. Don't hang up. Jeff, Doug, Ben, Kelsey. I'm going to
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:47.880]  kill you after Jeff. We're going to come right back to you. The need for storable foods are
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:57.160]  increasingly apparent with millions left without power including most grocery stores. Many Texas
[2:57:57.160 --> 2:58:04.360]  residents are left without food. The lines of the grocery stores are getting longer and longer
[2:58:04.920 --> 2:58:13.080]  while most of the store shelves are left bare. Now we know that in the most historic record
[2:58:13.080 --> 2:58:19.640]  freezing temperatures in over a century your government can simply turn off the power turn
[2:58:19.640 --> 2:58:26.840]  off the heat and turn off the water. Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're
[2:58:26.840 --> 2:58:34.920]  able to feed your family. Go to infowarstore.com and get at least a year supply of storable foods
[2:58:34.920 --> 2:58:41.720]  to make sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable. Get your storable foods at
[2:58:41.720 --> 2:58:51.640]  infowarstore.com. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful
[2:58:51.640 --> 2:58:56.760]  dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this
[2:58:56.760 --> 2:59:03.160]  degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[2:59:03.160 --> 2:59:08.840]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood
[2:59:08.840 --> 2:59:14.840]  pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing
[2:59:14.840 --> 2:59:21.160]  reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have
[2:59:21.160 --> 2:59:27.960]  suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the
[2:59:27.960 --> 2:59:35.000]  concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:41.320]  and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil
[2:59:41.320 --> 2:59:45.720]  for a friend, family member or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:45.720 --> 3:00:02.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:07.400 --> 3:00:12.440]  You can run for a long time. I'm Alex Jones, your host. I'm a destroyer. It's going to be coming
[3:00:12.440 --> 3:00:16.440]  in at three o'clock to host. I've got so much to say and so much I didn't get to because I've
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:19.720]  been really upset. I didn't get to a lot of it. I'm going to go ahead and call us with Owen
[3:00:20.680 --> 3:00:26.600]  at least an hour. So look for that. I'll take off 30 minutes and go try to get an extra generator
[3:00:26.600 --> 3:00:31.240]  in here and try to get an electrician in because part of the systems when the generators went on
[3:00:31.240 --> 3:00:35.080]  blew up. And so that's why our backup system didn't work quite like it was supposed to.
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:41.720]  And it's just, it's been a mess and I'm not complaining. I just, and I'm not being gloom
[3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:45.880]  and doom because of our own problems here in Texas. I've harped on this power issue
[3:00:46.440 --> 3:00:50.840]  and people are like, why do you care about power? No one thinks about power lines and plugs. That's
[3:00:50.840 --> 3:00:56.920]  what I do is I study the globalists. They're obsessed with taking your power away. If your
[3:00:56.920 --> 3:01:02.440]  power is expensive, you can't have a thriving country. Period. It's another tax.
[3:01:02.440 --> 3:01:11.960]  And I have a warehouse that's got a bunch of employees and we actually do warehouse work
[3:01:11.960 --> 3:01:16.440]  for other people and other companies to try to pay the bills here. I got other businesses
[3:01:16.440 --> 3:01:22.600]  that I run to try to pay the bills here. I'll leave it at that. And so I take money and I feed it
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:29.960]  in here. You understand that? And all the other big warehouses are allowed to stay open. They're
[3:01:29.960 --> 3:01:35.720]  all essential. They get power, but we don't. And that's the essence of this technocracy,
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:41.080]  is they can go right down the line, down to neighborhood at neighborhood. You saw those maps
[3:01:43.240 --> 3:01:47.480]  where Antifa would only hit certain targets and they were all the maps where JPMorgan Chase
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:51.560]  wanted to buy something. This is all very precise. They're testing a new form of war
[3:01:52.120 --> 3:01:57.320]  where there are people burning only certain targets. Only certain things are allowed to stay open
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:02:01.080]  and then they all just vertically integrate. This is for a technocracy. I mean, my God,
[3:02:02.280 --> 3:02:06.840]  Jeff Bezos doubled his wealth in one year under the lockdown. You understand that?
[3:02:08.840 --> 3:02:12.520]  These people aren't playing games, okay? And we're just sitting here like sitting ducks
[3:02:12.520 --> 3:02:16.920]  and now they're taking all the money and they're funding it into buy all the politicians.
[3:02:16.920 --> 3:02:21.480]  This is criminal. This is dangerous. I said I'd go to your calls. Jeff, first time caller,
[3:02:21.480 --> 3:02:25.240]  finishing up. You're making some great points about Arkansas. Yes, I know that Arkansas,
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:31.400]  like Texas was 10 years ago, is still a net seller of energy. Texas used to be the king
[3:02:31.400 --> 3:02:35.560]  supplying everybody. Now we can't even supply ourselves so they can make fun of us and call
[3:02:35.560 --> 3:02:41.000]  us names, but they notice they turned your power off for eight hours just to show you who's boss.
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:43.720]  And it came out in the Enron documents that that's a tactic they do.
[3:02:45.400 --> 3:02:51.240]  Exactly. And I got the text message the night before. Interestingly, the coldest night out
[3:02:51.240 --> 3:02:56.440]  of this whole storm, I get the text from the energy company from energy and they said,
[3:02:57.160 --> 3:03:02.520]  you be ready because we may turn off your power because everybody's consuming too much,
[3:03:02.520 --> 3:03:06.280]  turn down your thermostat, all this kind of stuff. And sure enough, I'll wake up the next
[3:03:06.280 --> 3:03:12.440]  morning and it's off. Remember when they put the smart meters in 10 years ago and even brag,
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:18.760]  they said, governments want to be able to control your thermostat remotely so that you don't use
[3:03:18.760 --> 3:03:23.400]  too much carbon. So now that'll be the excuse is we've got a remote control your thermostat with
[3:03:23.400 --> 3:03:27.080]  the smart meter that's already there or it'll cause more blackouts. See how it works?
[3:03:27.800 --> 3:03:31.800]  Alex, the smart meter, they told me they said, if you don't want a smart meter,
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:37.640]  you're going to have to pay extra money if you don't want a smart meter so that they
[3:03:37.640 --> 3:03:42.600]  really kind of force you financially to get smart meter. But they're going to get you down the road
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:47.880]  ripping you off with it. Well, of course. Yeah. I mean, you come out the loser at the end of the
[3:03:47.880 --> 3:03:54.520]  day. And all I got to say is you have to be self-reliant, make sacrifices where you can.
[3:03:55.320 --> 3:04:00.440]  If folks that are listening, I mean, when this blows over, don't forget about it. Hit a wood
[3:04:00.440 --> 3:04:06.840]  stove if you can. Not only that, but get not only your house right, but get your spiritual life right.
[3:04:06.840 --> 3:04:10.520]  And I'm just going to take advantage of this platform right now. I like some people are going
[3:04:10.520 --> 3:04:14.920]  to get offended. But if you don't know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you can have
[3:04:14.920 --> 3:04:19.000]  everything else right. But if your spiritual house is not in order, what's the whole point?
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:22.600]  Get in the hole. No, I agree. What would a prophet man in the whole world lose his soul? Let me
[3:04:22.600 --> 3:04:28.600]  last this last thing. Biden has signed on to agenda 2030 that says ban all space heaters,
[3:04:28.600 --> 3:04:33.080]  ban all wood heaters and all oil heaters. Europe's already adopted it. For radio listeners,
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:37.880]  I just showed the articles. Biden is preparing to announce fines of thousands of dollars for any
[3:04:37.880 --> 3:04:42.520]  type of fire. They're training you with these fire bands to get ready for it. But now they're
[3:04:42.520 --> 3:04:46.840]  going to ban heaters in your home. You will freeze the death. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:04:54.120 --> 3:05:01.320]  Finally, we're seeing major state governments in the United States running TV and radio ads saying
[3:05:01.320 --> 3:05:08.200]  everybody take your vitamin D three, take your zinc and take your C. It's essential for your body
[3:05:08.200 --> 3:05:13.880]  cells to maintain your health. Essential means you must have it. It's been sold out for months.

[3:06:10.360 --> 3:06:15.640]  four. Owen Schreuer is going to be hosting for three hours. I'll be there for part of the show
[3:06:15.640 --> 3:06:22.360]  remotely. I'm going to be out on the road. We're going to your phone calls right now. But let me
[3:06:22.360 --> 3:06:26.680]  just show you some of these headlines since I mentioned them. Wood burners, most polluting fuels.
[3:06:26.680 --> 3:06:31.800]  Oh, they're bad. Wood burning has always been evil on the earth. And then it creates potash that
[3:06:31.800 --> 3:06:37.160]  goes into the atmosphere and forms nuclei that forms rain. And the burning cycle of wood and
[3:06:37.160 --> 3:06:43.160]  things has been known for millennia as what creates the nitrogen and things back into the soil. But
[3:06:43.160 --> 3:06:51.160]  oh, oh, that fire you love. It's dirty. It's evil. It's bad. And San Francisco, of course, is as
[3:06:51.160 --> 3:06:57.880]  signed a law to ban your fireplaces. You will be fine if you were caught. So we're going to turn
[3:06:57.880 --> 3:07:03.080]  your power off Norway to ban the use of oil for heating buildings by 2020. And that was three
[3:07:03.080 --> 3:07:10.840]  years ago. And they did it. Bay Area cities go to war against gas stoves in homes and restaurants.
[3:07:10.840 --> 3:07:16.280]  Yes. Yes, you can't have gas either, even though it's totally clean. Well, it creates a little
[3:07:16.280 --> 3:07:24.680]  carbon dioxide. Sorry. They're never going to stop. Never going to stop. Never going to stop for the
[3:07:24.680 --> 3:07:31.320]  Green Police. And Mark Zuckerberg in a new leak video says he's not going to take the vaccine,
[3:07:31.320 --> 3:07:36.120]  doesn't trust him. That's okay, because you are. Aren't you? All right, I got something big. I'm
[3:07:36.120 --> 3:07:40.280]  going to hit next segment. I want to get to your calls. Right now, though, I'm going to get my
[3:07:40.280 --> 3:07:45.720]  ducks in a row here about Greg Abbott and this private Democrat run company that turned our power
[3:07:45.720 --> 3:07:51.880]  off. But this is all well planned operation. And this is so they can make fun of the whole
[3:07:51.880 --> 3:07:57.160]  texate, you know, like Brexit, Texas movement to succeed, which has really gained a lot of steam.
[3:07:57.160 --> 3:08:00.360]  I've had like, I wanted to see my doctor to check up and he was telling me about it.
[3:08:01.320 --> 3:08:04.760]  And then the female doctor came in to the rest of the check up, but she was telling me about it.
[3:08:04.760 --> 3:08:10.040]  I mean, people are really, really on fire with all this. Joe Biden's dark winter is here, ladies
[3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:18.760]  and gentlemen, Sally Tolberg, her co-chairwoman lives in Michigan and works for governor kill
[3:08:18.760 --> 3:08:27.240]  the old people, Whitmer. All right, Jeff. Jeff, a lot of great points. I had you hold over to finish
[3:08:27.240 --> 3:08:32.760]  and I appreciate your calls. They bought a Jeff. Let's go ahead and talk to John in the great city
[3:08:32.760 --> 3:08:38.120]  where I was just yesterday with Stephen Crowder of Dallas, my hometown. Go ahead, John. Hey,
[3:08:38.120 --> 3:08:43.000]  how are you doing? I'm just new. So I'm freaked out, man. I just, I just know it's gonna get worse
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:48.200]  and worse. Hey, I'm freaked out too. I wanted to talk to you. I was alone when we get out,
[3:08:48.200 --> 3:08:53.320]  but I wanted to kind of talk to your listeners real quick and let you know about the doctors that
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:08:56.840]  is involved in the reset. They've been involved for a while. And I wanted to kind of let you know
[3:08:56.840 --> 3:09:02.600]  what was going on in my situation. Tell us. Yeah. Okay. So I'm the disabled veteran. I'm 40 years
[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:09.640]  though. I've been disabled for 18 years. 2018, I hired Ted Cruz to the governor said I owed him
[3:09:09.640 --> 3:09:16.760]  $16,000. Ted Cruz went in and fought for me. He won the VA didn't like that because they had to
[3:09:16.760 --> 3:09:24.120]  pay for a lot of my college too. I have $3 degrees. 2019, they tried to deem me disabled. I mean,
[3:09:24.120 --> 3:09:31.080]  not disabled because they see me at a Donald Trump rally. And they also see me in 2018 when
[3:09:31.080 --> 3:09:35.640]  Donald Trump came down for the done thing in Dallas. I was in all the newspapers with my pistol
[3:09:35.640 --> 3:09:43.320]  on my side. And the VA didn't like that for some strange reason. And then fast forward when Donald
[3:09:43.320 --> 3:09:49.400]  Trump came down in October, they see me at the rally. I posted and also have a bitch with Donald
[3:09:49.400 --> 3:09:53.720]  Trump. They didn't like that. And Donald Trump wrote me two letters. They didn't like that. So
[3:09:53.720 --> 3:09:58.600]  they pulled me aside. So they didn't like that. And they, they told me I wasn't a veteran anymore.
[3:09:58.600 --> 3:10:04.920]  So what they did, they stripped out my money from me. And 2020 January, I broke, I became,
[3:10:04.920 --> 3:10:09.320]  I've been a veteran for 18 years. All of a sudden, I'm not a veteran. So I started
[3:10:09.320 --> 3:10:14.360]  complaining against them, the VA, of the discrimination, discrimination against my
[3:10:14.360 --> 3:10:19.720]  disability for political views. And right now I'm still going through with them. But COVID-19 is
[3:10:19.720 --> 3:10:26.200]  slowing everything, everything down. So they, oh yeah, they used COVID to not give us access to
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:31.480]  the courts. That's another reason they did it. Yeah, they sold everything down. And you write
[3:10:31.480 --> 3:10:35.320]  about access to courts. That's what's going on too. They won't even do virtual with me.
[3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:40.200]  And they said, I got to wait in order just to get my money back, my back, they all that.
[3:10:40.200 --> 3:10:45.320]  So then the VA, the people in the VA, they were biting the border. They contacted Social Security.
[3:10:45.320 --> 3:10:49.880]  And I told them I was going to use what Donald Trump had to where I can go and I can go to
[3:10:49.880 --> 3:10:54.280]  an outside doctor and use that. So they contacted Social Security. So Social Security cut out my
[3:10:54.280 --> 3:10:58.440]  money. So I was getting two checks for the rest of my life. Now I don't get a veteran's check.
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:11:02.360]  Now I don't get a Social Security check. That's the thing about the technocracy is Biden wasn't
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:07.720]  elected. And so it's not just you now. It's everybody. They're going to kill the old people.
[3:11:07.720 --> 3:11:12.600]  They're going to take the checks from the veterans and the disabled. And Biden just tripled
[3:11:12.600 --> 3:11:17.800]  prescription drug prices. It's even more for Ed's one. And now they're going to cut Medicare and
[3:11:17.800 --> 3:11:23.080]  Medicaid. But it's okay because he's Joe Biden. Because like he told voters, I don't need you
[3:11:23.080 --> 3:11:27.560]  to vote for me. I'm going to win. I don't need to campaign. So yeah, but here's the good news,
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:32.520]  brother. They're coming after everybody now. So all these people, you were fighting and you
[3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:36.600]  lost what you had because you fought for what was right. Now all these people that sat on the fence
[3:11:36.600 --> 3:11:40.120]  and did nothing, they're going to lose what they got. What do you think is going to happen? Here's
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:44.840]  the thing about tyrants. They can't help it when they do this. They're going to push and push until
[3:11:44.840 --> 3:11:48.360]  somebody stops them. Thomas Jefferson was once asked, what is the limit with tyranny will go?
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:53.080]  He said, as much as you let them take, they can't help it. So the bad news is they're crazy and
[3:11:53.080 --> 3:11:56.600]  aren't going to stop. The good news is they're crazy and aren't going to stop. So it's going to
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:12:01.240]  get so damn bad. They're going to get stopped. You see what I'm saying? And I see exactly what
[3:12:01.240 --> 3:12:05.640]  you said. I've been listening for 10 years. I love you, man. I'm saying like this. I don't appreciate
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:13.160]  how they're doing me. And I want to fight on the frontline. I want, if Trump, if he has, if he's
[3:12:13.160 --> 3:12:19.720]  going to come back 2024, I want to fight with him because they have taken everything from me. I have
[3:12:19.720 --> 3:12:25.400]  four service animals. And I've been in this little electricity grid that they took from me.
[3:12:25.400 --> 3:12:30.840]  I contacted Encore. And Encore told me that they couldn't tell me back home. They said,
[3:12:30.840 --> 3:12:36.760]  I have to prove my disability. So I sent them some paperwork to prove my disability. And they
[3:12:36.760 --> 3:12:41.320]  wouldn't even, this is what they're telling me. They said it has to be updated. This letter you
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:47.320]  sent us from 2019. We won't want it. They all played bureaucratic games. And here's what you do.
[3:12:47.320 --> 3:12:50.840]  You just start going and protesting in front of their facility every day until they arrest you.
[3:12:50.840 --> 3:12:54.680]  You make a news item out of it. You just fight back. And then other people are going to start
[3:12:54.680 --> 3:12:59.160]  joining you, brother. This is the time to protest every day. I love you and I appreciate you, John.
[3:12:59.160 --> 3:13:03.320]  All right. Some more great calls. Ben in Quebec. Thank you for holding up in Canada.
[3:13:03.320 --> 3:13:08.760]  Then we'll talk to you. No, actually, Kelsey's first then Ben as our last caller. Kelsey, thanks
[3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:13.960]  for holding in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, once a great steel city. Pour and steal again. Not now.
[3:13:13.960 --> 3:13:22.440]  Obama pledges to shut that down. So, Kelsey, go ahead. Hi, Alex. Welcome. Hi. I'm sorry. I love you.
[3:13:22.440 --> 3:13:27.480]  I have never called him before, but I mean, this is crazy what's going on in Texas right now.
[3:13:29.000 --> 3:13:33.880]  And I feel so bad for everyone in Texas. Well, I have family that works inside and that they
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:36.920]  say it's all made up. I already knew that, but it's all made up. They have plenty of power.
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:44.600]  It's all made up. They're just ripping us off. Yeah. I don't know. This is so crazy. It's
[3:13:44.600 --> 3:13:50.840]  scary. It's really scary. Everything that's going on. I think a lot of people are waking up,
[3:13:50.840 --> 3:14:00.280]  but I don't think it's happening fast enough. And I don't know. Well, let me say this. What do you
[3:14:00.280 --> 3:14:05.160]  make a Biden cut in the Keystone pipeline off? That's enough power to fund half the country,
[3:14:05.160 --> 3:14:10.600]  literally. I mean, if people are denying that they're cut the power off,
[3:14:11.320 --> 3:14:14.600]  they admittedly are doing it. We're under damn attack. Can you believe this?
[3:14:15.480 --> 3:14:20.360]  Oh, man. My husband, he's a union worker. He actually worked with a shell plant here in
[3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:29.640]  Manaca, Pennsylvania. And most of the guys there on the job site, they voted for Trump, but
[3:14:29.640 --> 3:14:37.960]  I mean, there's still a lot of guys there that are, it's really weird with the union guys.
[3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:43.720]  I mean, they grew up Democrat and like all the old heads, it doesn't matter. It's like,
[3:14:44.440 --> 3:14:51.080]  there's people that are like, you know, vote blue no matter who, but they're really worried now.
[3:14:51.640 --> 3:14:54.840]  I mean, that really shocked them whenever he shut that pipeline down.
[3:14:54.840 --> 3:14:59.880]  Absolutely. And you notice that it came out that time magazine article bragging how they
[3:14:59.880 --> 3:15:06.200]  stole the election that the head of the AFL-CIO worked with the chamber of commerce that's famous
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:11.560]  for shipping our jobs overseas, worked with the union busters to beat Trump to steal the election.
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:17.960]  So I mean, it's just sick. It's so Trump totally went to bat for this country. He wasn't perfect.
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:22.120]  And now people are seeing this, but see, Biden doesn't care because he's a dictator
[3:15:22.120 --> 3:15:27.480]  and he's about to cause a civil war coming for the guns. That's another thing. My husband,
[3:15:27.480 --> 3:15:32.520]  I mean, he goes every morning. Well, not every morning, but on the weekends, you know, he works
[3:15:32.520 --> 3:15:39.480]  through Monday through Friday, but whenever he can, he goes up to the AMO store and he gets AMO
[3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:44.680]  every morning. Well, he's smart. He's lucky to have a lady like you. I hear that baby in the
[3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:48.760]  background. God bless you. All right. Another caller hung up from Quebec. That's okay. I got

[3:17:23.400 --> 3:17:27.640]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my
[3:17:27.640 --> 3:17:32.920]  mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:32.920 --> 3:17:36.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:41.960]  they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait

[3:18:48.040 --> 3:19:01.800]  The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent. With millions left without power,
[3:19:02.520 --> 3:19:08.280]  including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left without food.
[3:19:09.560 --> 3:19:15.880]  The lines at the grocery stores are getting longer and longer while most of the store shelves
[3:19:15.880 --> 3:19:24.280]  are left bare. Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:31.080]  your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[3:19:32.680 --> 3:19:37.400]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[3:19:38.040 --> 3:19:45.480]  Go to infowarstore.com and get at least a year supply of storable foods to make sure you and your
[3:19:45.480 --> 3:19:52.360]  family are prepared for the unimaginable. Get your storable foods at infowarstore.com.
[3:19:52.360 --> 3:20:12.360]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:30.840]  So, heavy metal rock bands from Germany know it. Jesus told you. Now you see it. America was a
[3:20:30.840 --> 3:20:36.920]  Christian nation. We had our problems. We had wars over fixing them. But now we've got just
[3:20:37.560 --> 3:20:43.400]  people that want to absolutely steal and rob and manipulate and have raw power over you.
[3:20:43.400 --> 3:20:52.360]  This is all about raw power over you, raw power over your family, over your power.
[3:20:53.320 --> 3:20:56.440]  Literally, it's not a pun. They want power over your power. They want power over your body,
[3:20:56.440 --> 3:20:59.480]  they want power over your genetics, they want power over your children, they want power over
[3:20:59.480 --> 3:21:07.080]  your soul. They want power over your very essence. And let's put up the ERCOT executive who we're
[3:21:07.080 --> 3:21:12.920]  digging into. And I knew this group was just as bad as Enron. Enron wrote the book. I showed it
[3:21:12.920 --> 3:21:19.640]  last hour, how Enron got caught in other countries and in the U.S., jacking up prices by saying there
[3:21:19.640 --> 3:21:24.360]  were power allergies and not enough power. And they found that if you said there wasn't enough power,
[3:21:24.360 --> 3:21:30.680]  people would then accept higher power prices. That's how it works. And there's a Wall Street
[3:21:30.680 --> 3:21:35.800]  Journal article, a market watch article from back in 2002, 18 years ago, admitting it. So there's
[3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:40.680]  documentaries on it, congressional hearings. This is a fact. And the weird thing about criminals
[3:21:40.680 --> 3:21:44.840]  is they do the same thing over and over again, more than even the general public. Criminals are
[3:21:44.840 --> 3:21:51.000]  very OCD. And so they're doing it. And I told you last week, I said they're going to have rolling
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:54.920]  blackouts now, now that Biden's shut down the Keystone pipeline. And I said, it's not because
[3:21:54.920 --> 3:22:02.200]  that pipeline shut down, that never got opened. It was almost completed. Like 98% done. That's
[3:22:02.200 --> 3:22:12.200]  crazy. It's like $20 billion to build. But now they'll start turning the power off just to train
[3:22:12.200 --> 3:22:16.360]  you because they found if you're starving to death or you don't have money, you're not going to be
[3:22:16.360 --> 3:22:21.720]  complaining politically. You're going to sit there and take it. And the big bang's going to make more
[3:22:21.720 --> 3:22:29.080]  money. So let me show you some of these articles. And what's unfolding. Governor Greg Abbott received
[3:22:29.080 --> 3:22:37.560]  Tri Global Energy Wind Leadership Award, PR Newswire. He received it February 9th. Well,
[3:22:37.560 --> 3:22:46.440]  that was just, that was just like 10 days ago. Eight days ago. The global energy, a leading US
[3:22:46.440 --> 3:22:51.320]  originator and developer of utility scale renewable energy products. You mean crap.
[3:22:51.320 --> 3:22:59.320]  Today, announced that Texas Governor Greg Abbott is the recipient of the Tri Global Energy Award for
[3:23:00.040 --> 3:23:03.880]  signing into law more windmills and shutting down cold plants.
[3:23:11.160 --> 3:23:17.720]  Meanwhile, there's an article here for the posting by Carol Dutton. I looked this up.
[3:23:17.720 --> 3:23:22.760]  There's SWAT teaming people's houses with regular pickup trucks with people dressed in what looks
[3:23:22.760 --> 3:23:30.120]  like US Army uniforms, probably our army. Because someone, the neighbors said he looked like he was
[3:23:31.000 --> 3:23:35.560]  at the Capitol, even though he wasn't the guy they saw at the Capitol. Doesn't matter. Now,
[3:23:35.560 --> 3:23:39.320]  just you're at the Capitol. Well, here comes the SWAT team. Because we've got to disappear you.
[3:23:39.320 --> 3:23:46.040]  But here it is, back by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, right through energy ventures,
[3:23:47.960 --> 3:23:53.480]  places, first bets on power storage because of coming power outages. That was three years ago.
[3:23:54.440 --> 3:23:59.080]  Gee, they can do the math if they cut off all the coal power that was supplying 80% of the country
[3:23:59.080 --> 3:24:05.160]  15 years ago. Now it's like 55, 60%. Wow. This other systems don't work. They already did it in Spain.
[3:24:05.160 --> 3:24:11.480]  Spain never came out of their depression since then. Meanwhile, here it is,
[3:24:12.680 --> 3:24:18.760]  Biden rescinds Trump order banning Chinese Communist involvement in US power grid. And just last week,
[3:24:18.760 --> 3:24:24.120]  or week and a half ago, they asked Saki about it. Remember, and Saki just said, I'm not going to
[3:24:24.120 --> 3:24:31.320]  comment on that. Okay. But she does comment on bringing Biden's dogs are going to be coming to the,
[3:24:31.320 --> 3:24:35.480]  I guess, the press conference. Oh, look, he has dogs. He's nice. Oh, well, it's cultural for
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:39.240]  Xi Jinping to eat them, though. You know, he just came out and said, well, it's their culture to
[3:24:39.240 --> 3:24:43.160]  attack Hong Kong. It's their culture to have millions of people in death camps that work for
[3:24:43.160 --> 3:24:50.280]  Apple and slave labor. You know, it's he said that I played it last hour. Terrible, terrible situation.
[3:24:51.560 --> 3:24:58.440]  So since we mentioned that, let's play Saki. I've lost my list of videos here, but let's,
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:25:07.320]  let's play Saki, the press secretary, a little lonesome person. The big news was that Saki
[3:25:08.520 --> 3:25:13.240]  came out and said that, well, let me tell you what we'll do for small business to shut down
[3:25:13.240 --> 3:25:17.560]  by COVID. We put a woman in charge of that. Oh my gosh, a woman's, well, it doesn't matter
[3:25:17.560 --> 3:25:22.360]  if I go bankrupt now. I mean, a woman is in charge of the small business initiative that Biden's
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:26.600]  trying to shut down. Well, I mean, absolutely fine. Blow up all the small businesses now.
[3:25:26.600 --> 3:25:31.240]  A woman's in charge. I can't criticize it. But what she said in there is, oh,
[3:25:32.120 --> 3:25:34.920]  you want to know when the lockdown ends, you want to know when the mask wearing stops?
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:41.240]  We can hope someday. Now it's hope someday. You know, just out there, Bill Gates says never.
[3:25:41.240 --> 3:25:47.160]  Here, here is Saki talking about that. Would like to know your thoughts about a very
[3:25:47.160 --> 3:25:51.800]  controversial and divisive issue. General, please. Hi, it's Jen Saki, the White House
[3:25:51.800 --> 3:25:57.240]  Press Secretary. I'm back again to answer your questions that you sent on Twitter. What is the
[3:25:57.240 --> 3:26:04.360]  American Rescue Plan? It's a $1.9 trillion package that does three things. Has funding to get vaccines
[3:26:04.360 --> 3:26:09.320]  into the arms of more Americans. Two, it has funding to reopen schools. I'm a mom. I know how
[3:26:09.320 --> 3:26:14.600]  important that is. And three, it gets relief to Americans who need help the most. When will we
[3:26:14.600 --> 3:26:21.240]  get another stimulus check? What's happening is the House committees are negotiating the pieces of
[3:26:21.240 --> 3:26:25.800]  the package through their committees. Once they're done, it will go to the Senate. Once it comes through
[3:26:25.800 --> 3:26:30.280]  that process, the President's looking forward to signing it, and we're hopeful that's as soon as possible.
[3:26:31.240 --> 3:26:36.600]  When can Major Enchamp come to a press briefing? Major Enchamp, this is for you. You're invited
[3:26:36.600 --> 3:26:41.800]  anytime to the briefing room. I will have snacks and treats in there right behind the podium that
[3:26:41.800 --> 3:26:47.160]  will just be for you. When will we be getting vaccines? What we're working to do here from the
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:52.040]  White House and from the administration is get more vaccine supply out to states. So if you're
[3:26:52.040 --> 3:26:58.040]  eligible in your state, if you're over 65 in many states, you should be able to get the vaccine,
[3:26:58.040 --> 3:27:02.600]  but it's going to take some time. It's going to take several months to ensure that every American
[3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:08.920]  has access to that. Shut her up, please. You have to show the phone that you've had it
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:14.040]  to do whatever you want, to go wherever you want, to do whatever you want.
[3:27:14.040 --> 3:27:19.560]  Again, it's about the global ID. It's about the global tracking, and Xi Jinping designed it. They
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:24.760]  give him credit. The Chinese designed it, and we have to adopt it. It's like, oh, Xi Jinping.
[3:27:25.800 --> 3:27:31.320]  You're allowed to invade Hong Kong. You're allowed to act like God. You're allowed to run
[3:27:31.320 --> 3:27:37.240]  death camps for Buddhists and Muslims and Christians. He said that yesterday, but it's okay
[3:27:37.240 --> 3:27:41.640]  because Tim Cookskay and so was Anderson Cooper. He's like, you know, I'm not going to get the
[3:27:41.640 --> 3:27:45.160]  way of what they do. That's their culture. They need to do it to make China strong.
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:51.800]  The only thing I've heard crazier is the Prime Minister of Canada saying, quote,
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:56.360]  I like the strong dictatorship of China. I admire dictatorship. I mean,
[3:27:56.360 --> 3:28:01.720]  these people are telling you they admire dictatorship, and they're not giving you a
[3:28:01.720 --> 3:28:05.320]  strongman dictatorship that's so popular he gets elected. So he's not a dictator,
[3:28:05.320 --> 3:28:09.800]  but he does act as an autocrat. It's not like it's even an autocrat that's for the people.
[3:28:09.800 --> 3:28:14.520]  You know, those are the philosopher king types still has a big problem, because what happens
[3:28:14.520 --> 3:28:19.800]  when Putin goes, you know, it'll just go back to what it was. But the point is, is that this is
[3:28:19.800 --> 3:28:25.480]  an unelected real dictator who's super unpopular, who goes to bat against you.
[3:28:27.800 --> 3:28:32.760]  You understand? All right, we're going to come right back with a key clip of Zuckerberg admitting
[3:28:32.760 --> 3:28:38.040]  that the vaccine is dangerous, leaked video, and we're going to get some comments from the one,
[3:28:38.040 --> 3:28:45.640]  the only John Rappaport of NoMoreVacueness.com. I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com, band.video.
[3:28:45.640 --> 3:28:50.120]  Download every video, share it, save it on hard drive. Who knows how long we'll even be here.
[3:28:53.320 --> 3:28:57.800]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic,
[3:28:58.520 --> 3:29:04.120]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:29:04.120 --> 3:29:09.080]  and for word of mouth. And then we're all in this together. And you know, it gets old having to
[3:29:09.080 --> 3:29:12.520]  come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:29:12.520 --> 3:29:16.440]  But it's true, we're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this
[3:29:16.440 --> 3:29:21.240]  level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut
[3:29:21.240 --> 3:29:25.240]  down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups. And we're still here. And as this whole
[3:29:25.240 --> 3:29:30.360]  new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken
[3:29:30.360 --> 3:29:34.040]  off air. That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations
[3:29:34.040 --> 3:29:39.000]  enslaved, and America's still quasi-free. You can't have info wars has been proven right,
[3:29:39.000 --> 3:29:43.800]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold. Because if you think stuff's bad now,
[3:29:43.800 --> 3:29:48.440]  just get ready. So thank you all. And get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election
[3:29:48.440 --> 3:29:52.200]  shirts, supplements and so much more. They're wonderful products, and they support the info.
[3:29:52.200 --> 3:29:58.040]  We're thanking you. In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out,
[3:29:58.040 --> 3:30:06.280]  called Wayne's World. Even before I had an access to a show in the mid-1990s,
[3:30:06.280 --> 3:30:11.240]  I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that was fun. In fact, you speak out and have your
[3:30:11.240 --> 3:30:15.400]  own ideas. And even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real. Well,
[3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:21.960]  what do they say in Wayne's World? We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Every day when I cover
[3:30:21.960 --> 3:30:25.800]  these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you. Because these topics are so huge,
[3:30:25.800 --> 3:30:29.160]  are so real. But I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right. And most of
[3:30:29.160 --> 3:30:33.960]  the time we do. The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy
[3:30:34.600 --> 3:30:40.280]  destroying humanity. They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[3:30:40.280 --> 3:30:44.520]  That, for me, is really sick to have. And disgusting. So you've got to pledge for
[3:30:44.520 --> 3:30:50.040]  myself and the whole info wars crew that we will never join the globalists. We will never
[3:30:50.040 --> 3:30:54.920]  knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together. I've been thinking a lot
[3:30:54.920 --> 3:31:00.200]  lately about playing devil's advocate on there. About looking at the world from the perspective
[3:31:00.200 --> 3:31:04.200]  of the globalist, that the public so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their
[3:31:04.200 --> 3:31:08.600]  future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be
[3:31:08.600 --> 3:31:14.120]  killed. Yes, that's the position of the globalists. They play God. And they think because we don't
[3:31:14.120 --> 3:31:20.040]  stand up, they have a right to do this to us. And I've told you that the globalists have tried
[3:31:20.040 --> 3:31:25.480]  to hire me. They try to get me to join them. But metaphysically, at a spiritual level, I have
[3:31:25.480 --> 3:31:29.960]  the Holy Spirit. I'm connection with God. And I know that God does not like that. So I cannot
[3:31:29.960 --> 3:31:35.640]  join the enemy. But I'll tell you at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go
[3:31:35.640 --> 3:31:39.480]  along with the system, believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power out of it.
[3:31:40.120 --> 3:31:45.080]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[3:31:45.080 --> 3:31:50.360]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of
[3:31:50.360 --> 3:31:57.560]  the universe doesn't like. And that's a fact. I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[3:31:57.560 --> 3:32:04.440]  I just love it. I can't get enough of it. We've got a fresh brew right now. That's what fills my mug.
[3:32:04.440 --> 3:32:09.160]  That's what fills my belly. That's what fills my soul. Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee. Folks,
[3:32:09.160 --> 3:32:15.880]  we have had this coffee for years at infowarstore.com. Years. Never raised the price. Never. The Wake
[3:32:15.880 --> 3:32:20.680]  Up America Blend, the best coffee. The crew here loves it. We drink it every day. And of course,
[3:32:20.680 --> 3:32:26.520]  that's just one of the great ways you can support Infowars here. Everybody drinks coffee or just
[3:32:26.520 --> 3:32:31.720]  about everybody. Why not support Infowars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake
[3:32:31.720 --> 3:32:35.880]  Up America Patriot Blend? Of course, read all the great reviews. Pretty much perfect review there.
[3:32:35.880 --> 3:32:40.680]  4.9 star. When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless
[3:32:40.680 --> 3:32:44.920]  literally everybody gets a five star. So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody
[3:32:44.920 --> 3:32:49.800]  who gives it a five star except maybe one or two people. Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee, only
[3:32:49.800 --> 3:33:12.760]  available at infowarsstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:12.760 --> 3:33:17.240]  John Rabaport is always loaded for bear. He's about to take over. And I'm going to introduce
[3:33:17.240 --> 3:33:23.160]  him with this video of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO admitting that he just doesn't trust the
[3:33:23.160 --> 3:33:27.880]  vaccine, the side effects. Really, India just banned it. Merck pulled out. South Africa is
[3:33:27.880 --> 3:33:31.800]  banning it. Australia banned their vaccine. Now they've got another one. I mean, they are really
[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:35.240]  acting suspicious where they're like putting revivals out. Like be careful. It's dangerous. But
[3:33:35.240 --> 3:33:40.360]  oh, you got to take it to have a job. And we got a global ID and Israel is the most draconian right
[3:33:40.360 --> 3:33:43.960]  now. My God, they're arresting acidic Jews and masks because they won't take the vaccine.
[3:33:43.960 --> 3:33:49.400]  I mean, it's getting bad. Let me go back to Sally Talberg, ERCOT chairwoman. Remember,
[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:55.880]  ERCOT is the new Enron. But it's in bed with Governor Whitmer and of course Cuomo and of course
[3:33:55.880 --> 3:34:01.480]  Biden. And so she's up in Michigan. She runs ERCOT. We went over to ERCOT earlier today. It's
[3:34:01.480 --> 3:34:05.800]  totally empty. Like two cars in the giant parking lot. It controls all the thousands of little
[3:34:05.800 --> 3:34:09.800]  power plants around Texas that Obama was trying to shut down. He shut down about half of them.
[3:34:09.800 --> 3:34:16.200]  We used to supply 10, 15 states around us. Now that's not the case. This is all about them going
[3:34:16.200 --> 3:34:21.400]  in and controlling all the new smart thermostats with the smart hub, as they call it, the smart meter.
[3:34:22.040 --> 3:34:26.280]  And then they're going to say, oh, we've got to control everything now because there's not enough
[3:34:26.280 --> 3:34:30.360]  power. And we got to control your refrigerator. And we got to control your computer. And we got
[3:34:30.360 --> 3:34:35.480]  to talk to your digital assistant. So it's about the AI moving into your house. The contact tracers
[3:34:35.480 --> 3:34:40.200]  then come to your house. They have little social worker conversations with you, analyze what's
[3:34:40.200 --> 3:34:45.960]  going on, call the cops, call CPS, call elder care. Looks like things aren't good. And then later,
[3:34:45.960 --> 3:34:50.840]  they come with the police to take your guns. It's all an admitted plan. Here's another one.
[3:34:51.480 --> 3:34:57.560]  The heads of ERCOT board of directors don't even live in Texas. Honeywell is giving utility
[3:34:57.560 --> 3:35:03.800]  companies access to your thermostat. Forbes. That's from many, many years ago, seven years ago,
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:08.120]  eight years ago, how utility companies lower electricity use by controlling your thermostat.
[3:35:08.120 --> 3:35:11.480]  I remember when I was young, people 20 years ago, they were planning it because I've watched, like,
[3:35:11.480 --> 3:35:15.080]  you know, the hearings and stuff. They're like, oh, it's for postures. I don't want to do that.
[3:35:16.760 --> 3:35:24.120]  So that's what this is. He's about to take over. He is no more fake news.com. Here's a two minute
[3:35:24.120 --> 3:35:30.120]  clip, though, of the latest coup by Project Veritas. Zuckerberg in leaked video saying we just don't
[3:35:30.120 --> 3:35:36.440]  know the long term side effects basically modifying people's DNA and RNA. He put that out on purpose.
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:40.680]  These leaks have been on purpose. I don't think the folks at Project Veritas are bad. They're great,
[3:35:40.680 --> 3:35:45.480]  but I want to work with Biden. I don't like censoring. I don't like the vaccine. This is to
[3:35:46.120 --> 3:35:52.200]  boost his credibility because he works for Bill Gates, his direct aid to camp. He is the heir
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:58.440]  to Bill Gates, not Bill Gates's little rat-like children. And so let's go ahead and play that
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:03.240]  clip and then John Rapport will take over. We just don't know the long term side effects of
[3:36:03.240 --> 3:36:09.800]  basically modifying people's DNA and RNA. DNA is inherent in your own. We do yourself.
[3:36:10.680 --> 3:36:15.560]  We just don't know the long term side effects of basically modifying people. Last week, Facebook
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:21.000]  announced they are, quote, expanding their efforts to remove false claims on Facebook and Instagram
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:26.360]  about COVID-19 vaccines. Let's take a look at Facebook's most updated COVID-19 vaccine policy.
[3:36:26.360 --> 3:36:31.080]  The real kicker is right here in the policy where Facebook says it would remove any content that,
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:38.120]  quote, claims the COVID-19 vaccine changes people's DNA. Well, we just got a new leak
[3:36:38.120 --> 3:36:45.160]  tape from Zuckerberg himself, the CEO of Facebook, basically violating his own code of conduct.
[3:36:45.720 --> 3:36:51.320]  He would be censored on the platform today for what he said. I share some caution on this because
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:57.480]  we just don't know the long term side effects of basically modifying people's DNA and RNA.
[3:36:57.480 --> 3:37:02.840]  So when Zuckerberg said, quote, basically the vaccine is modifying people's DNA,
[3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:07.800]  it seems pretty clear modifying is synonymous with changing. Again, Zuckerberg would be banned
[3:37:07.800 --> 3:37:14.040]  from Facebook for saying this. This video of me showing the CEO of Facebook talking might be banned,
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:19.880]  but then Zuckerberg on November 30th in a public live stream Q&A appears to somewhat changes tune.
[3:37:19.880 --> 3:37:25.320]  I mean, my understanding is that these vaccines do not modify your DNA or RNA.
[3:37:25.320 --> 3:37:32.440]  No. First of all, DNA is inherent in your own nucleus cell. Sticking in anything foreign
[3:37:32.440 --> 3:37:36.280]  will ultimately get clear. Well, I'm glad we can clear that up.
[3:37:37.480 --> 3:37:41.320]  Yeah, I'm glad we could clear that up. Isn't it interesting that Zuckerberg can vastly
[3:37:41.320 --> 3:37:46.360]  involve his thinking on the subject of vaccines as soon as he's made up his mind or appears
[3:37:46.360 --> 3:37:50.840]  to have made up his mind on the topic. He just allows the almost three billion Facebook users
[3:37:50.840 --> 3:37:56.440]  to do the same rules for thee, but not for me. Seems a little bit hypocritical.
[3:37:56.440 --> 3:38:02.840]  All right, the full reports on info wars.com. But I mean, they do this as a proviso to metaphysically
[3:38:02.840 --> 3:38:07.640]  there to protect themselves. It's a rule they follow. He has to tell his employees,
[3:38:07.640 --> 3:38:11.080]  he has to let you know out there one place the truth, then come out and say this other thing.
[3:38:11.080 --> 3:38:15.800]  But what it does is it programs your cell to create this protein. And the top scientists
[3:38:15.800 --> 3:38:20.200]  say that when the cell dies or divides, it will offset that where you're now going to have an
[3:38:20.200 --> 3:38:25.080]  autoimmune response to that. That's just one of the problems. John Rappaport will be joining me
[3:38:25.080 --> 3:38:28.760]  in the next few days on my full show. I cut him short today. I appreciate him still being here
[3:38:28.760 --> 3:38:35.080]  for a segment and a half. John Rappaport, give us the latest, my friend. Thank you, Alex. Very good.
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:43.960]  Mark Zuckerberg. Wow. Wow. Wow. Speaking out of both sides of his mouth, how unusual. Okay.
[3:38:43.960 --> 3:38:53.400]  First of all, folks, I want to comment on a gentleman named Alfie Oaks. You can see his
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:39:03.240]  video recently on band.video at info wars, a very fine piece of work by a man who owns a grocery
[3:39:03.240 --> 3:39:11.560]  store in Naples, Florida, who wants business owners to stand up and open up on March 1.
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:20.200]  Regardless of restrictions, regulations, lockdowns, what have you, because he's been running a
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:28.200]  grocery store in Florida all this time where masks are not mandatory. Voluntary, you want to wear,
[3:39:28.200 --> 3:39:37.880]  find, you don't find. And he understands that this is a crackdown in destruction of the economy
[3:39:37.880 --> 3:39:45.560]  that is completely anti-constitutional, violates every legal freedom and natural freedom that
[3:39:45.560 --> 3:39:54.040]  we have. And he is encouraging other business owners across the country to join on March 1
[3:39:54.040 --> 3:40:05.160]  and open up, open up the economy. I would say this is a very vital thing. I only, not only would say
[3:40:05.160 --> 3:40:15.160]  it is Alfie Oaks, you'll find his video at band.video on info wars. And I certainly commend and
[3:40:15.160 --> 3:40:23.960]  congratulate him for not only speaking out, but keeping his business alive through thick and thin
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:32.600]  all during this whole insane ordeal. So in the time remaining today, I want to
[3:40:32.600 --> 3:40:46.120]  begin launching an effort to show you a weak spot, a major weak spot in the globalist enemy program
[3:40:46.920 --> 3:40:54.680]  that can be defeated with your help. You know, it's one of these deals where
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:41:01.560]  lots and lots and lots of people pay attention to important information, but then there's a
[3:41:01.560 --> 3:41:09.400]  question of what do you do with it? Do you just absorb it or do you share it and pass it on?
[3:41:10.280 --> 3:41:15.800]  Because there is a thing, and I assure you it's true because I've seen it,
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:22.360]  there is a thing called critical mass of information. And when it reaches that critical mass,
[3:41:22.360 --> 3:41:32.440]  all kinds of unpredictable things happen that are good if the information is true. All kinds of
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:39.560]  good things happen at critical mass when the information is true. So I want to start launching
[3:41:39.560 --> 3:41:45.800]  this today here. I won't have time to explain it completely, but I'll be on next week for sure
[3:41:45.800 --> 3:41:54.360]  doing that. And that weak spot in the opponent is the PCR test, because I'm talking about the
[3:41:54.360 --> 3:42:00.600]  lockdowns, the shutdowns, the destruction of the economy, the brutalization and destruction of many
[3:42:00.600 --> 3:42:08.200]  lives all over the planet on purpose, as we have been saying to usher in the great reset
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:19.960]  and the technocratic revolution that demolishes what is human in humanity. The test, the PCR test
[3:42:19.960 --> 3:42:30.920]  that presumably detects the virus, is the key to the enemy's scientific position. All of the case
[3:42:30.920 --> 3:42:36.040]  numbers are based on it, and the lockdown supposedly are based on the case numbers.
[3:42:36.040 --> 3:42:42.840]  But the test is completely fraudulent, and I have explained it, and I will explain it again
[3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:51.000]  in significant detail. But it means nothing unless you pass on the information. See you
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:55.320]  right after the break. Stay with us. The ultimate fluoride-free charcoal

[3:43:50.680 --> 3:43:59.160]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[3:44:00.120 --> 3:44:07.880]  that this is all a test. This experience, this mindfulness planet is a reckoning. It's God
[3:44:08.680 --> 3:44:13.400]  giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend
[3:44:13.400 --> 3:44:19.400]  eternity and what level we want to go to. And it really does come down to that. So as sad as
[3:44:19.400 --> 3:44:23.960]  things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:30.360]  is the author of our consciousness. God is the author of us having our own will. God is the
[3:44:30.360 --> 3:44:37.000]  author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing. When you look at mainstream
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:43.160]  media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult,
[3:44:43.160 --> 3:44:46.840]  it's all about dominating your free will. It's all about telling you you're dirty,
[3:44:46.840 --> 3:44:51.080]  you're ugly, you're bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God,
[3:44:51.080 --> 3:44:58.520]  the creator of the universe. I knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by cowards
[3:44:58.520 --> 3:45:06.280]  and by double talking agents of the enemy. A lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like,
[3:45:06.280 --> 3:45:11.320]  oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible. And I understand why people learn to believe
[3:45:11.320 --> 3:45:14.760]  that because this is scary what's going on in the global government and the New World Order.
[3:45:14.760 --> 3:45:18.360]  And now that people woke up in fact that's real, they won't somebody to come save them from.
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:23.480]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried. My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just
[3:45:23.480 --> 3:45:27.160]  tripled for quadruple depending on the drug once Biden signed that executive order.
[3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:31.240]  We pay the most of anybody in the world. That's just one case of hundreds of things
[3:45:31.800 --> 3:45:35.880]  that Trump had reversed and now people are going to feel the sting of the pain,
[3:45:35.880 --> 3:45:40.680]  the energy cost, everything else. But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate
[3:45:40.680 --> 3:45:45.320]  where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election
[3:45:45.320 --> 3:45:51.640]  and just engaged all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks. The swamp is deep.
[3:45:51.640 --> 3:45:57.720]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it. The entire New World Order system is about making
[3:45:57.720 --> 3:46:03.800]  you feel pathetic and making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take
[3:46:03.800 --> 3:46:08.840]  your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:15.080]  being given free will. Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed
[3:46:15.080 --> 3:46:20.920]  of an entire universe, an entire system. And the fact that you're able to commune with God,
[3:46:20.920 --> 3:46:25.320]  the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean
[3:46:25.320 --> 3:46:29.800]  or the beauty of your life or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge,
[3:46:29.800 --> 3:46:34.200]  the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is
[3:46:34.200 --> 3:46:40.760]  energetic and that itself is what God teaches us is worship. So don't worship the globalist,
[3:46:40.760 --> 3:46:46.040]  don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God
[3:46:46.040 --> 3:46:51.000]  because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while
[3:46:51.000 --> 3:47:16.280]  you still have it, while you still have it. If you are receiving this transmission,
[3:47:16.280 --> 3:47:23.480]  you are the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host,
[3:47:23.480 --> 3:47:31.000]  John Trappaport. Okay, last segment of this hour, I'm talking about the PCR test,
[3:47:32.040 --> 3:47:40.440]  which is a great weak point in the enemy's position. If you will take the truth and pass it
[3:47:40.440 --> 3:47:48.200]  on to many, many people and in this segment only have time to dip into this because there are many,
[3:47:48.200 --> 3:47:56.120]  many details here that are vital. First of all, different labs come up with different results
[3:47:56.120 --> 3:48:03.160]  for the PCR test. This has been known as an open secret in the testing community for decades now.
[3:48:03.160 --> 3:48:11.320]  That is to say, a person could get tested at one lab, negative another lab, positive.
[3:48:12.840 --> 3:48:21.000]  That is fantastically important. Strategy. Imagine what would happen if a person armed
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:28.200]  with a good lawyer would be tested three or four times, let's say within a very short space of time
[3:48:28.200 --> 3:48:34.200]  in three or four different geographic areas to be sure that the test would be going to three
[3:48:34.200 --> 3:48:41.640]  or four different labs and they came back with different results. Positive, negative, positive,
[3:48:41.640 --> 3:48:50.200]  negative. If that isn't a basis for a lawsuit, I don't know what is. That's a note to lawyers.
[3:48:50.200 --> 3:48:59.640]  That's a note to clients, potential clients. That's called a strategy, real life, real time strategy
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:09.400]  that has legs, that has guts. That can be publicized at the same time that it can be entered as a
[3:49:09.400 --> 3:49:19.960]  case in court. Number two, let's take this requires a bit more explanation. Let's say that
[3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:26.840]  you're a person that has been told they have to get tested for whatever reason, tested for the virus.
[3:49:28.520 --> 3:49:35.240]  So you have a good lawyer and you go in to get tested and you say, hold on, before I get tested,
[3:49:35.960 --> 3:49:46.280]  I want the lab that is going to process this test to issue a sworn affidavit stating how many
[3:49:46.280 --> 3:49:53.720]  cycles they run the test at. Okay, now I have to provide a little background. What does that mean?
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:50:05.240]  The PCR test is done in cycles. Each cycle is a quantum leap in amplification of the test sample
[3:50:05.240 --> 3:50:12.360]  swab taken from the patient. That's the way the test is done. So you have one cycle,
[3:50:12.360 --> 3:50:18.680]  magnifies the test sample, two cycles, magnifies it much bigger on and on and on.
[3:50:19.960 --> 3:50:28.920]  It is common knowledge and we have the citation from Anthony Fauci that when a test is run higher
[3:50:28.920 --> 3:50:44.280]  than 35 cycles, the results are meaningless, useless, deceptive. However, and all of this is cited in
[3:50:44.280 --> 3:50:50.840]  my articles at nomorefakenews.com where I'm doing a series now that I've launched on the PCR test.
[3:50:50.840 --> 3:51:02.600]  However, the guidelines for labs in America issued by the FDA and the CDC recommend doing
[3:51:02.600 --> 3:51:11.160]  the PCR test up to 40 cycles to find the virus. That means that labs are going along with that.
[3:51:11.160 --> 3:51:17.400]  That means that labs are going to be running this test at levels that are meaningless,
[3:51:17.400 --> 3:51:23.560]  deceptive, and spin out false positive results like a fire hose.
[3:51:26.040 --> 3:51:29.640]  If that isn't a basis for a lawsuit, I don't know what is.
[3:51:30.680 --> 3:51:38.600]  So client, lawyer go in to get tested and they say, oh, wait a minute. We want to
[3:51:38.600 --> 3:51:46.440]  sworn affidavit from the lab that's going to process this sample and test it as to how many
[3:51:46.440 --> 3:51:53.720]  cycles they're doing the test at. If the lab refuses to come across to that information,
[3:51:54.520 --> 3:52:02.600]  lawsuit. If the lab comes across with the information and it's higher than 35 cycles,
[3:52:02.600 --> 3:52:11.240]  lawsuit. Now imagine let's say 100 or 200 such clients and lawyers around the United States
[3:52:11.240 --> 3:52:20.760]  filing these lawsuits and the publicity that would attach to all of this as a way of detonating
[3:52:22.200 --> 3:52:32.760]  consciousness, truthful consciousness about the deceptive PCR test, which is the basis of all
[3:52:32.760 --> 3:52:39.800]  claims of case numbers and the basis for all of the lockdowns and economic destruction.
[3:52:39.800 --> 3:52:48.200]  Are you getting my message here? Now to put a capper on this, and again I have the citation
[3:52:48.760 --> 3:52:58.440]  in the New York Times, labs in America do not report the number of cycles they run the test at
[3:52:58.440 --> 3:53:06.120]  to doctors or patients. They just simply don't do it. That's very interesting, isn't it?
[3:53:06.120 --> 3:53:14.280]  You wonder why? Well I've explained why because if they admit that they're running the test at
[3:53:14.280 --> 3:53:23.400]  higher than 35 cycles, they're libel. They're committing a crime. They're deceiving people and
[3:53:23.400 --> 3:53:34.040]  calling them positive for the virus, which is a lie. This is a fantastic scandal folks,
[3:53:34.040 --> 3:53:40.760]  and this is just the beginning of the scandal. Now I know there are lawyers out there listening
[3:53:40.760 --> 3:53:52.280]  to this program. I've handed you two strategies for making a serious inroad on the official
[3:53:53.240 --> 3:54:00.360]  lying position on the PCR test, and if you're willing to pick up the ball and run with it,
[3:54:00.360 --> 3:54:07.320]  all kinds of things can happen. And for people who are watching and listening, all kinds of good
[3:54:07.320 --> 3:54:15.480]  things can happen if you spread this information. The information contained in this program,
[3:54:16.440 --> 3:54:21.480]  this segment that I'm doing right now, and in the articles that I'm publishing at No More Fake
[3:54:21.480 --> 3:54:30.920]  News about the PCR test, alerting to the public what the truth is and the lies are behind this
[3:54:31.480 --> 3:54:44.040]  fabricated operation, a covert operation, using a fatally flawed test to deceive the public,
[3:54:44.040 --> 3:54:53.960]  jack up case numbers and bring upon the destruction of the economy through these brutal lockdowns.
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  That's the chain of events. That's what people have to understand more and more clearly.
[3:55:05.640 --> 3:55:13.640]  I have already exposed and will be exposing again statements in official medical literature
[3:55:13.640 --> 3:55:21.320]  from the World Health Organization, from the CDC, from the FDA, admitting that their own test
[3:55:22.120 --> 3:55:32.520]  is irreparably flawed, the PCR test. Not my words, their words. They admit it in their own literature,
[3:55:32.520 --> 3:55:38.440]  and I have the statements, and I've quoted them before in articles, and I'm reprinting those
[3:55:38.440 --> 3:55:47.000]  articles again. So there's more to this than I have the time to explain here in these two segments today.
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:57.960]  When there is a war, and there is a war, and if you're listening here on info wars, you know
[3:55:57.960 --> 3:56:03.880]  there is a war. There is a war against freedom. There is a war against the individual. There's a war
[3:56:03.880 --> 3:56:15.000]  against sane society, open society, freedom, liberty, all of the things that make life meaningful
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:27.000]  and worthwhile. Then what we need to do is to look at the enemy, the technocrats, the globalists that
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:38.040]  want to destroy everything that is good about life, and say they're not overwhelming. Come on.
[3:56:39.720 --> 3:56:50.760]  What is their weak point? What are their weak points? And there are several at least.
[3:56:50.760 --> 3:57:03.240]  I'm pointing to one major one here, the test, the PCR test, which is geared to produce all these
[3:57:03.240 --> 3:57:11.320]  false numbers that are hypnotizing the public via the news, that are being used by governors,
[3:57:11.320 --> 3:57:18.600]  presidents, premiers to institute these brutal lockdowns and the destruction of economies
[3:57:18.600 --> 3:57:28.840]  across the world as a prelude to the dystopian technocracy that they want to impose on humanity.
[3:57:31.320 --> 3:57:36.600]  Stay tuned because there's going to be a lot more here. Pass along this information. This is
[3:57:36.600 --> 3:57:41.240]  John Mappaport. Thank you and for wars. See you next time.
[3:57:41.240 --> 3:57:49.240]  I sell supplements for two reasons, because they work, they're real, they're powerful,
[3:57:49.240 --> 3:57:54.760]  and because it's a giant market. But again, why is there a giant market? Because it works.
[3:57:55.480 --> 3:58:00.360]  That's why it exponentially grows. So whether it's Saupon Meadow and other key ingredients
[3:58:01.240 --> 3:58:07.960]  in our prostate formula, Prostagard, or whether it is the super high grade,
[3:58:07.960 --> 3:58:14.040]  organic vitamin B12, and ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force,
[3:58:14.840 --> 3:58:20.920]  or the pure deep breath crystal iodide on an X2, these are all the very best supplements you're
[3:58:20.920 --> 3:58:26.840]  going to find in already great market of high quality products out there. And it funds the
[3:58:26.840 --> 3:58:31.080]  info war. So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're finding the info
[3:58:31.080 --> 3:58:37.320]  wars, you can't lose info wars delivers in space. Please visit infowarstore.com and get the products
[3:58:37.320 --> 3:58:41.880]  today. Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at infowarstore.com.
[3:58:43.640 --> 3:58:51.000]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government. But world government is only
[3:58:51.000 --> 3:58:57.960]  the control grid. Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become
[3:58:57.960 --> 3:59:04.200]  gods and attain immortality. But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[3:59:04.200 --> 3:59:10.920]  of all carbon based line forms. That's why they say carbon is bad. They are rewriting the entire
[3:59:10.920 --> 3:59:17.640]  genetic code of the planet. They are playing God. They believe they have been inspired by
[3:59:17.640 --> 3:59:24.200]  interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[3:59:24.760 --> 3:59:30.120]  I know this sounds insane. But if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on record.
[3:59:30.120 --> 3:59:37.000]  You have been warned. You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[3:59:37.000 --> 4:00:01.000]  This is the end of all life on earth as we know it. This is the alien takeover of earth.
