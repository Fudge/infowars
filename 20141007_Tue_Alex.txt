[00:00.000 --> 00:13.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.200 --> 00:31.780]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it's the
[00:31.780 --> 00:37.080]  Alex Jones show live on this Tuesday October 7th edition I'm Paul Joseph Watson once again
[00:37.080 --> 00:42.960]  filling in for Alex we've got another jam-packed show coming up David Knight in studio as well
[00:42.960 --> 00:48.240]  as Anthony Gucciotti next hour we've got Robert David Steele who of course is a former CIA
[00:48.240 --> 00:54.680]  officer wrote a book which I read recently the open source manifesto he's gonna talk about a
[00:54.680 --> 00:59.960]  prediction he made last month in which he said that Ebola would be used in the United States as
[00:59.960 --> 01:06.000]  a false flag event we're gonna dig down into that also gonna get into some solutions about how
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.360]  Steele lays out the hierarchical control the top-down system how that can be reversed how we
[01:12.360 --> 01:18.320]  can turn it into a grassroots populist uprising which is of course what the elite are concerned
[01:18.320 --> 01:24.480]  about given the CFR's recent proclamation about the American distemper which is the fact that
[01:24.480 --> 01:30.280]  this uprising this populist revolution is on the horizon Steele has made similar comments to that
[01:30.280 --> 01:36.280]  effect so we're gonna get into that and more in the next hour obviously first hour we're focusing
[01:36.280 --> 01:43.800]  on the latest Ebola news because it gets even more ridiculous we have an article here at the
[01:43.800 --> 01:50.520]  Daily Mail President Obama's basically outlined his mission to defeat Ebola Obama's new airport
[01:50.520 --> 01:56.760]  screening plan uses customs agents to spot Ebola as president concedes we don't have a lot of
[01:56.760 --> 02:03.240]  margin for error so basically the same people that rifle through your bags at the airport are going
[02:03.240 --> 02:09.640]  to be checking people for Ebola and if you have confidence in customs agents to do that then you
[02:09.640 --> 02:15.640]  probably missed the next article which went up on info wars.com yesterday we're gonna play this
[02:15.640 --> 02:22.640]  clip after the break CNN reporter returning from Liberia horrified by lack of airport Ebola screening
[02:22.640 --> 02:29.640]  so this CNN reporter and several of her colleagues basically traveled through Atlanta Airport and
[02:29.640 --> 02:37.000]  were quote shocked by the complete lack of screening for Ebola they outright told the airport
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.360]  officials the customs officials that they had just traveled back from West Africa that they could
[02:42.360 --> 02:47.960]  potentially have been exposed to Ebola basically they weren't even asked any questions they were
[02:47.960 --> 02:54.600]  allowed to go on their way no checks were taken so if that is the character of the provisions that
[02:54.600 --> 03:00.840]  the Obama administration is now taking in the fight against Ebola as now the WHO in Europe warns
[03:00.840 --> 03:08.280]  that it's basically inevitable that Europe will see an Ebola outbreak after a case in Spain yesterday
[03:08.280 --> 03:13.320]  we've now got articles suggesting there could be potentially 56 other people exposed to the
[03:13.320 --> 03:20.360]  Ebola virus at this hospital in Spain they see 56 being monitored in Spain after Ebola infects nurse
[03:20.360 --> 03:26.040]  so the WHO is really taking this seriously in Europe saying this this could lead to an outbreak
[03:26.040 --> 03:33.400]  whereas in the United States there's no talk whatsoever of banning flights US not considering
[03:33.400 --> 03:39.160]  a travel ban amid Ebola outbreak says the White House and again they stuck to that line for you
[03:39.160 --> 03:44.920]  know over a week now basically but if you thought that was crazy then take a look at this out of
[03:44.920 --> 03:52.040]  the Daily Mail Dallas Ebola victim stepdaughter who took him to hospital as he was vomiting wildly
[03:52.040 --> 03:59.240]  is given all clear to return to work as a nursing assistant so this is the stepdaughter of patient
[03:59.240 --> 04:06.760]  zero Thomas Eric Duncan of course was taken ill in Dallas last week with Ebola after they sent him
[04:06.760 --> 04:12.280]  home for a period of days having failed to detect the virus even though Duncan told them he had
[04:12.280 --> 04:19.080]  traveled back from Liberia now they're sending his stepdaughter who was in the apartment with him
[04:19.080 --> 04:25.240]  with the vomit stained blankets and towels she was in the ambulance with him as he traveled to
[04:25.240 --> 04:32.680]  the hospital and again it can take up to 21 days for people to show symptoms of Ebola and yet the
[04:32.680 --> 04:42.200]  CDC has given the all clear to send this individual back to work as a nursing assistant absolutely
[04:42.200 --> 04:47.800]  unbelievable and that's just the tip of the spear we're going to get more into Ebola going to cover
[04:47.800 --> 04:52.760]  some police state news later as well Robert David Steel coming up David Knight in studio

[08:25.160 --> 08:31.640]  joseph octson filling in for alex now we're gonna go to a cnn clip and let's just preface this with
[08:31.640 --> 08:37.720]  a quote from josh urnis the white house press secretary on the subject of ebola he said quote
[08:37.720 --> 08:42.920]  there is a very sophisticated multi-layered screening system in place to ensure that the
[08:42.920 --> 08:50.120]  traveling public is safe that's the white house press secretary josh urnis a couple of days ago
[08:50.120 --> 08:56.040]  talking about the preparations that they're making for ebola of course they've refused to shut down
[08:56.040 --> 09:01.240]  any flights coming in from west africa now we're going to have customs agents the same people that
[09:01.240 --> 09:07.240]  rifle through your bags supposedly screening for ebola in airports even though technically
[09:07.240 --> 09:14.520]  that can be sidestepped you can take ibuprofen and not registers having a high fever so it is
[09:14.520 --> 09:19.720]  indeed completely useless obama's new airport screening plan uses customs agents to spot ebola
[09:20.680 --> 09:26.440]  so josh urnis the white house press secretary ensures us that the traveling public is safe
[09:26.440 --> 09:32.600]  because now they've got these measures in place to catch ebola at the border before it arrives in
[09:32.600 --> 09:39.320]  the united states at the airport which is not the experience of cnn reporters who travel through
[09:39.320 --> 09:44.840]  atlanta airport last week let's go ahead and roll that clip i expected that they were going to
[09:44.840 --> 09:49.080]  take my temperature they were going to ask me lots of questions but they didn't i said i'm a
[09:49.080 --> 09:54.680]  journalist i've come back from liberia i was covering ebola and the the gentleman who was
[09:54.680 --> 09:59.160]  helping me the officer he started to hand my passport back and say welcome home but instead
[09:59.160 --> 10:03.720]  he said oh wait a second i got an email about passengers like you hold on a second and he
[10:03.720 --> 10:06.920]  went and conferred with someone and he didn't know and they conferred with someone else and in the
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.960]  end he said you need to watch yourself for signs of ebola and i said well what am i watching for
[10:11.960 --> 10:16.840]  and he couldn't tell me now is it that weren't bad enough robin i was traveling with two colleagues
[10:16.840 --> 10:21.160]  a photojournalist and a producer and they weren't told anything and they also said that they were
[10:21.160 --> 10:25.400]  journalists you've been covering ebola so we were all kind of shocked and pretty horrified at the
[10:25.400 --> 10:29.560]  lack of screening in u.s airports but you know as we've been talking about that may be changing
[10:29.560 --> 10:35.000]  they may be doing more to screen passengers who are coming in from west africa so again that's a
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.520]  cnn reporter and a couple of her colleagues basically saying that she went through the airport
[10:40.520 --> 10:46.120]  in atlanta they barely even asked her any questions they said oh yeah we got an email about it we
[10:46.120 --> 10:51.240]  might want to ask you about that but you know nothing happened and again we go back to the
[10:51.240 --> 10:57.800]  fact that people can take painkillers ibuprofen to fool these temperature detectors anyway
[10:57.800 --> 11:05.960]  so the threat of ebola tourism as was rumored in the case of patient zero very much remains in place
[11:05.960 --> 11:11.320]  so the y-house again has refused to shut down any air travel any air flights coming in from west
[11:11.320 --> 11:18.440]  africa and now the cdc has gone one step further in its complete insanity in its response to this
[11:18.440 --> 11:24.440]  ebola crisis with this story out of the daily mail dallas ebola victim stepdaughter who took him
[11:24.440 --> 11:30.520]  to hospital as he was vomiting wildly is given all clear to return to work as a nursing assistant
[11:31.240 --> 11:36.520]  the stepdaughter of texas ebola victim thomas duncan who called 911 and rode in the ambulance
[11:36.520 --> 11:43.720]  with the man she calls daddy has been told she can return to work miss jalla whose contact with
[11:43.720 --> 11:48.520]  contact with mr duncan who remains in a critical condition was far more intimate and prolonged
[11:48.520 --> 11:55.160]  than that have her husband told mail online on monday the cdc came yesterday they said i can go
[11:55.160 --> 12:01.080]  back to work but i do not know what i will do i will not go back yet doctors say that no one is
[12:01.080 --> 12:05.960]  at risk of catching the virus unless they come into contact with a sufferer who is exhibiting
[12:05.960 --> 12:12.520]  symptoms which as we'll get on to in a moment is apparently not the case a new york times article
[12:12.520 --> 12:19.960]  from 2000 suggests that even people who aren't exhibiting symptoms of ebola can infect other
[12:19.960 --> 12:26.760]  individuals and again going back to this family when they were holed up in the dallas apartment
[12:26.760 --> 12:33.640]  as the cdc sent unprotected workers to clean up the vomit on the sidewalk we we showed you
[12:33.640 --> 12:40.680]  those pictures a couple of days ago as they were holed up in there given no advice by the cdc
[12:40.680 --> 12:46.600]  and as the family told the media they quarantined themselves they were not even told initially
[12:46.600 --> 12:53.640]  by the cdc to remain in quarantine later you had armed men show up with guns who had to keep them
[12:53.640 --> 12:59.560]  in quarantine because basically they were given no information whatsoever so now the cdc has told
[12:59.560 --> 13:05.480]  the stepdaughter of the ebola victim that she can go back to work as a nursing assistant
[13:05.480 --> 13:11.400]  the potential for her to infect other people is vast working in that environment in fact
[13:11.400 --> 13:16.360]  we had the founder of ebola just yesterday come out and give an interview to the guardian
[13:17.080 --> 13:22.520]  in which he said one of the main threats was indian workers who were in west africa at the
[13:22.520 --> 13:30.920]  moment traveling back to india working in hospitals and infecting people that way so the very discoverer
[13:30.920 --> 13:36.760]  of ebola of the ebola virus back in the 70s is warning against this that you can't send people
[13:36.760 --> 13:42.680]  back to work in hospitals willy-nilly there you see apocalyptic scenario discoverer of ebola virus
[13:43.400 --> 13:49.720]  fears it could mutate and he's saying that because it's infecting so many people now even though it
[13:49.720 --> 13:57.080]  hasn't to all our knowledge gone airborne that it could mutate and go airborne eventually and he's
[13:57.080 --> 14:02.680]  saying that basically a lot of these workers these hospital workers in west africa could go back to
[14:02.680 --> 14:10.600]  india and infect other people that that doesn't seem to concern the cdc who have told the stepdaughter
[14:10.600 --> 14:16.280]  of patient zero and this is not out of the onion this is not a satirical article this is being
[14:16.280 --> 14:23.720]  reported widely today that she can go back to work immediately as a nursing assistant even
[14:23.720 --> 14:29.560]  though she was in the ambulance with the ebola victim she was handling the the vomit the sweat
[14:29.560 --> 14:35.000]  the bloodstained sheets of the ebola victim and bearing in mind that these symptoms can take
[14:35.000 --> 14:41.880]  up to 21 days to show and yet the cdc has said that she can go back to work she should be in
[14:41.880 --> 14:47.800]  quarantine for at least three weeks they should be running numerous tests on her because as we
[14:47.800 --> 14:54.280]  will see in a moment a lot of these tests turn out to be false negatives they can test for ebola
[14:54.280 --> 14:59.720]  and the initial test says that ebola is not found later tests can confirm it so we're going to get
[14:59.720 --> 15:06.840]  into that into a moment but the cdc is ordering not ordering but suggesting that the stepdaughter
[15:06.840 --> 15:13.720]  of the ebola victim can return to work even though she could be infected with the virus and just not
[15:13.720 --> 15:20.040]  showing symptoms for the next three weeks and this is key because the new york times reported back
[15:20.040 --> 15:29.560]  in 2000 some may carry ebola without showing any symptoms this is 14 years ago we knew about this
[15:29.560 --> 15:34.200]  the ebola virus which has caused death from high fever and bleeding in african outbreaks can also
[15:34.200 --> 15:40.600]  infect without producing illness according to a new finding by african and european scientists
[15:40.600 --> 15:46.280]  the possibility of asymptomatic infection was only suggested in earlier studies they said in
[15:46.280 --> 15:51.000]  last week's issue of the lancet now they said they documented such infections for the first
[15:51.000 --> 15:56.360]  time they found that the ebola virus could persist in the blood of asymptomatic infected
[15:56.360 --> 16:03.320]  individuals for two weeks after they were first exposed to an infected individual so everything
[16:03.320 --> 16:09.640]  we've been told so far by the cdc is that you can't infect anybody else unless you're already
[16:09.640 --> 16:16.040]  showing symptoms that has been discounted in this study which was published in the lancet
[16:16.040 --> 16:23.880]  a prestigious medical journal 14 years ago and yet this nurse is being sent back to work having
[16:23.880 --> 16:31.720]  had direct contact with patient zero there you see the article out of the new york times and then
[16:31.720 --> 16:37.960]  there's this out of newsweek why it's important to do multiple tests on suspected ebola victims
[16:37.960 --> 16:44.600]  before releasing them and it gets into the fact that people have been tested for ebola and the
[16:44.600 --> 16:49.560]  results have come back with a false negative they're tested again subsequently and they're
[16:49.560 --> 16:55.240]  found to have the ebola virus so all of these individuals that have been in contact with patient
[16:55.240 --> 17:02.120]  zero they're in Dallas we don't know how many have been tested we can't really trust the cdc
[17:02.120 --> 17:08.520]  given that they've been so lax on dealing with that family alone you know the vomit stained
[17:08.520 --> 17:14.600]  sidewalks were cleaned up with people without protection it took almost a week for an actual
[17:14.600 --> 17:20.920]  properly trained properly equipped hazmat crew to completely clean and disinfect and sterilize
[17:20.920 --> 17:28.360]  that apartment and then we have false negatives so people could be being tested for ebola it comes
[17:28.360 --> 17:33.800]  back negative and yet they could still have the virus and yet they're sending the nurse back to
[17:33.800 --> 17:40.920]  hospital where she could potentially infect hundreds or thousands of other people the insanity
[17:41.480 --> 17:48.680]  absolutely knows no bounds now we've got the border situation again no interdiction at the
[17:48.680 --> 17:56.200]  border whatsoever even though according to this report government figures indicate that 112
[17:56.200 --> 18:03.240]  individuals were interdicted illegally crossing into the United States from Guinea 231 from Liberia
[18:03.240 --> 18:10.760]  and another 145 from Sierra Leone the three ebola hotspots the period of these apprehensions was
[18:10.760 --> 18:16.680]  one in which we had a larger border patrol presence on the actual border than we do now so there were
[18:16.680 --> 18:24.200]  more border patrol agents in service back then when these figures were recorded now there are less
[18:24.200 --> 18:32.040]  and this doesn't even include all the people who were not interdicted by border patrol agents so
[18:32.040 --> 18:38.680]  god knows how many more hundreds of individuals from Liberia from Sierra Leone crossing the US
[18:38.680 --> 18:45.400]  border potentially having been exposed to ebola and again we had the speculation that patient zero
[18:45.400 --> 18:53.400]  Duncan had engaged in what's now being called ebola tourism because he um told his boss that he
[18:53.400 --> 18:59.480]  was traveling to the United States to get treatment having himself been infected with ebola after
[18:59.480 --> 19:06.440]  taking one of his pregnant family members to hospital in Liberia so this could really start
[19:06.440 --> 19:12.280]  a wave we had an article a few days ago there you see boss co-workers of US ebola patient
[19:12.280 --> 19:18.040]  he knew he had ebola US for it was desperate attempt to survive so speculation that he
[19:18.040 --> 19:23.480]  bordered the plane simply to get to the US to get treatment because West Africa is of course
[19:23.480 --> 19:30.360]  completely overwhelmed um he would have likely died or suffered a really long illness without

[24:24.520 --> 24:34.760]  the Alex Jones show live with me Paul Joseph Watson we got breaking news here
[24:34.760 --> 24:40.680]  Connecticut governor declared state of emergency over Ebola as a precaution so it seems that where
[24:40.680 --> 24:47.000]  as the White House has dropped the ball on this it's now being picked up by the states
[24:47.560 --> 24:53.160]  Connecticut government Daniel Malloy has declared a public health emergency for the state as a
[24:53.160 --> 24:58.280]  precaution during the Ebola epidemic that is affecting several countries in western Africa
[24:58.280 --> 25:02.520]  he signed an order declaring the emergency on Tuesday and it gives the commissioner of the
[25:02.520 --> 25:08.280]  state department of public health the authority to quarantine and isolate people whom the commissioner
[25:08.280 --> 25:14.920]  quote reasonably believes have been exposed to the Ebola virus so that's a higher standard of proof
[25:14.920 --> 25:21.880]  than the CDC requires of course we had the CDC measures reported back a couple of months ago
[25:21.880 --> 25:29.240]  where they said anybody with any respiratory illness could be quarantined or indeed anybody who
[25:29.240 --> 25:36.040]  was a healthy person they use the words well persons that were coming in into the airports
[25:36.040 --> 25:41.480]  that they could be quarantined by the CDC now the Connecticut governor is taking it one step
[25:41.480 --> 25:48.680]  further there you see the executive order from Obama anybody with respiratory illnesses this
[25:48.680 --> 25:54.600]  from the Connecticut governor is a higher burden of proof reasonably believes has been exposed to
[25:54.600 --> 26:02.280]  the Ebola virus is the quote so now they're taking their own steps to try and deal with this Ebola
[26:02.280 --> 26:08.920]  threat even as the administration and the CDC completely drops the ball here's a clip from
[26:09.640 --> 26:16.040]  local news channel reporting on a border patrol agent a national border patrol council union
[26:16.040 --> 26:22.280]  blowing the whistle on the threat of Ebola from individuals entering from Liberia and Sierra Leone
[26:22.280 --> 26:27.560]  let's go to the clip recently agents caught immigrants from Liberia one of the West African
[26:27.560 --> 26:33.400]  countries hit the hardest by Ebola now the border patrol union is saying if immigrants did bring
[26:33.400 --> 26:41.160]  the virus it'd be hard to contain the CDC issued a level three warning for US citizens to avoid
[26:41.160 --> 26:47.160]  traveling to West African countries experiencing an outbreak of Ebola but according to Chris Cabrera
[26:47.160 --> 26:52.760]  with the national border patrol council immigrants from those countries are already making their way
[26:52.760 --> 26:59.960]  here not too long ago we did catch some people I believe from Liberia during the 2013 fiscal year
[26:59.960 --> 27:07.560]  statistics show border patrol agents apprehended 112 immigrants from Guinea 231 from Liberia
[27:07.560 --> 27:13.720]  and 145 immigrants from Sierra Leone the three countries with the most cases of Ebola
[27:13.720 --> 27:17.400]  our main concern that like it's always been is the health and safety of our agent
[27:17.400 --> 27:22.440]  Cabrera worries that agents are not properly protected in case they come across an immigrant
[27:22.440 --> 27:28.360]  with the Ebola virus our agents are trained however we're not we're not medical professionals
[27:28.360 --> 27:33.160]  and if an immigrant with the disease does make it pass agents he worries they could pass the
[27:33.160 --> 27:38.280]  contagious disease to other immigrants while in a stash house like they saw recently during a
[27:38.280 --> 27:44.200]  scabies outbreak some of our agents did contact contract scabies and some of the other things
[27:44.200 --> 27:49.560]  that that the illegal aliens had luckily it's not something that's deadly like like Ebola customs
[27:49.560 --> 27:55.240]  and border protection confirms agents are trained to recognize signs of illnesses including Ebola
[27:55.240 --> 28:01.080]  and are told to contact the CDC immediately if they find someone they believe to be infected
[28:01.080 --> 28:05.880]  but the union worries immigrants with the disease may slip by because many times
[28:05.880 --> 28:12.200]  symptoms do not show up for two to 21 days we need to be more proactive and preventing from
[28:12.200 --> 28:16.920]  coming in as opposed to trying to contain it once it's already here and customs and border
[28:16.920 --> 28:21.640]  protection tells me they continue to work with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
[28:21.640 --> 28:26.760]  to develop procedures to identify travelers or immigrants that are bringing over contagious
[28:26.760 --> 28:33.960]  diseases in Granjeno Nadia Glendo action for news so that's the situation on the border there
[28:33.960 --> 28:39.880]  hundreds of individuals from Liberia from Sierra Leone being caught there and again just think of
[28:39.880 --> 28:43.960]  all the ones who were not caught and this was at a time when there were more border patrol
[28:43.960 --> 28:50.520]  agents there to interdict them it's amazing the fact that they can't even recognize people who
[28:50.520 --> 28:56.200]  dress up as ISIS terrorists and carry out stage beheadings as we had with their own Joe Biggs
[28:56.200 --> 29:03.000]  also James O'Keefe going across the Canadian border in a speedboat they failed to pick up that
[29:03.000 --> 29:09.560]  and yet were expected to trust them that they can detect people with signs of Ebola we keep hearing
[29:09.560 --> 29:15.640]  this thing about how the authorities have proper training and yet the hospital in Dallas where
[29:15.640 --> 29:20.840]  patient zero arrived they had gone through the Ebola training before he arrived yet they sent
[29:20.840 --> 29:27.960]  him home with antibiotics even though he told them he was from West Africa and of course that
[29:27.960 --> 29:34.760]  led to the situation now where his own stepdaughter is being sent to work as a nursing assistant
[29:34.760 --> 29:41.080]  even though she was exposed to him complete dropping of the ball by the CDC complete incompetence
[29:41.080 --> 29:46.600]  or is it more we're going to get into that with Robert David Steele and the at the next hour

[33:37.480 --> 33:42.840]  we've also got robert david steel former cia officer coming up and of course if you saw the
[33:42.840 --> 33:48.200]  video up on infowalls.com yesterday he gave an interesting prediction last month he said that
[33:48.200 --> 33:53.720]  an Ebola staged false flag attack was coming so we're going to drill down we're going to ask him
[33:53.720 --> 33:59.640]  if what we're seeing now with the Ebola outbreak is what he characterized during his appearance on
[33:59.640 --> 34:05.080]  the alex jones show last month but there's an interesting article given that we've considered
[34:05.080 --> 34:10.760]  we've reported numerous times the threat that the Ebola virus could mutate and go airborne to at
[34:10.760 --> 34:17.400]  least a limited extent experts worry virus may spread more easily than assume this is out of the
[34:17.400 --> 34:25.240]  la times uh dr cj peters who battled a 1989 outbreak of the virus among research monkeys
[34:25.240 --> 34:31.320]  housed in virginia and who later led the cdc's most far-reaching study of Ebola's transmissibility
[34:31.320 --> 34:37.320]  in humans said he would not rule out the possibility that it spreads through the air in tight quarters
[34:37.320 --> 34:43.080]  quote we just don't have the data to exclude it said peters who continues to research viral diseases
[34:43.080 --> 34:48.760]  at the university of texas in galveston so david you wanted to talk about that
[34:49.720 --> 34:53.640]  yeah paul we're seeing two different types of responses we're seeing a medical response and
[34:53.640 --> 34:58.920]  we're seeing a political response and on the political side it has been downright reckless
[34:58.920 --> 35:02.760]  that's why we've run articles saying that they're standing down that they're doing everything that
[35:02.760 --> 35:08.120]  they can to spread this it goes way beyond just trying to keep people from panicking and not
[35:08.120 --> 35:12.600]  spreading fear what they're doing is putting people recklessly at risk the way that they're
[35:12.600 --> 35:17.160]  portraying this and i think the person that best represents this is the guy who really
[35:17.160 --> 35:22.840]  is at the center of what's happening in dallas and that's this judge jinkins up there he also has
[35:22.840 --> 35:27.640]  he's a district county judge uh he's somebody that first kind of came to light back in the summer
[35:27.640 --> 35:32.760]  he was trying to get thousands of children as they were saying at the time they had all these
[35:32.760 --> 35:37.560]  unaccompanied children young children with teddy bears coming across the border by themselves
[35:37.560 --> 35:42.680]  making the thousands of miles journey across the border so he was going to house them and he very
[35:42.680 --> 35:48.120]  notably went door to door intimidating people about not protesting this saying that they weren't
[35:48.120 --> 35:52.760]  going to put up with any protests of people bringing that in that got him a seat across the table when
[35:52.760 --> 35:57.880]  obama came to dallas even though rick perry was seated at the far end of the table an interesting
[35:57.880 --> 36:03.080]  picture that you can find that where you can see the expression on uh on perry's face but the bottom
[36:03.080 --> 36:08.680]  line is this guy is a rabid pro illegal immigration advocate he's up for election in a couple of
[36:08.680 --> 36:13.080]  weeks and he's been telling people that there is no risk and he's been the one who's been issuing
[36:13.080 --> 36:18.440]  the quarantine orders quite a bit late but then also going into the apartment making a big show
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.240]  with the fact that he's going in without any protective clothing going to a press conference
[36:23.240 --> 36:28.040]  afterwards and saying i'm wearing the same shirt that i went in and hung out with him in the apartment
[36:28.040 --> 36:34.200]  and then i transported them and their belongings in my personal car for 45 minutes and uh i'm wearing
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.680]  the same shirt at this press conference that i wore with them i'm not afraid of this there is
[36:38.680 --> 36:45.560]  no risk is what he said that's his quote there is no risk well the reality of it is is that the
[36:45.560 --> 36:51.800]  materials in the apartment just as they quarantined the ambulance uh because it might be contaminated
[36:51.800 --> 36:56.600]  just as they tracked down that homeless man and under this judge's orders put him under quarantine
[36:56.600 --> 37:01.560]  they tracked him down not once but twice they brought him in once and they tested him they
[37:01.560 --> 37:06.200]  didn't find any symptoms he then subsequently left they did another manhut to bring him back and
[37:06.200 --> 37:11.800]  then put him under isolation so we're seeing a very schizophrenic approach to this but he goes out and
[37:11.800 --> 37:17.080]  tells people that there is no risk well the reality is that you can come down with it it's been
[37:17.080 --> 37:23.000]  reported by the new york times you can catch it from materials and it is present for up to hours
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.960]  or sometimes days depending on the material depending on the condition whether it's exposed to sunlight
[37:27.960 --> 37:32.920]  he was so late in doing anything at the apartment that he may very well have not exposed himself
[37:32.920 --> 37:39.000]  to any risk but what he's doing is modeling reckless behavior for the people in america that might
[37:39.000 --> 37:44.120]  come into contact with us you know the cemeteries in liberia are filled with the bodies of people
[37:44.120 --> 37:49.000]  who never thought they could get Ebola and so what he's doing is a big disservice to people
[37:49.000 --> 37:56.600]  this virologist dr philip k russell who was part of that experiment um i'm sorry he was not one of
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.200]  the persons who was part of that experiment he's with the us army's medical research development
[38:00.200 --> 38:06.840]  he says to be dogmatic is i think ill advised because there are too many unknowns here now
[38:06.840 --> 38:10.840]  there was another guy who was part of that experiment that you referred to where the monkeys
[38:10.840 --> 38:15.720]  got out of control and basically and his name is charles bailey he supervised the response
[38:15.720 --> 38:20.040]  and he said what he learned from the episode informs the suspicion that the current strain of
[38:20.040 --> 38:25.880]  ebola that is afflicting humans might be spread through tiny liquid droplets prepare propelled
[38:25.880 --> 38:30.360]  into the air by coughing or sneezing in other words by aerosols which is exactly what they
[38:30.360 --> 38:35.960]  were doing the other day when they were pressure washing without any protective equipment the
[38:35.960 --> 38:40.200]  area where he had thrown up on the sidewalk not coordinating it off from the public then the
[38:40.200 --> 38:45.240]  next day they send in a hazmat team to clean the apartment that's the kind of inconsistency the
[38:45.240 --> 38:50.360]  kind of nonsense that we're seeing the difference between the medical response and the political
[38:50.360 --> 38:55.880]  response and of course we had the university of illinois study which i reported on a few days ago
[38:55.880 --> 39:01.800]  which again they were talking about the potential aerial transmissibility of the Ebola virus they
[39:01.800 --> 39:07.080]  were saying that it could transmit more than three feet which is the current understanding
[39:07.080 --> 39:11.960]  with people coughing and sneezing so yeah we have that and we have the canadian study that you had
[39:11.960 --> 39:17.160]  talked about and what this guy continues to say about these monkeys that were dying of ebola he said
[39:17.160 --> 39:21.480]  they were dying in a pattern that was certainly suggestive of coughing and sneezing some sort of
[39:21.480 --> 39:25.640]  aerosol movement they were dying and spreading it so quickly from cage to cage that we finally
[39:25.640 --> 39:32.360]  came to conclusion the best action was to euthanize them all that's the way they stopped it and of
[39:32.360 --> 39:37.480]  course i mean we had the the public health agency of canada they admitted on their website
[39:37.480 --> 39:43.800]  as of august that was the last time it appeared on the website that ebola they strongly suspected i
[39:43.800 --> 39:50.280]  believe the exact words were that ebola had gone airborne in humans at least to a limited extent
[39:50.280 --> 39:56.360]  that was subsequently censored in light of the the most recent spate of outbreaks in western
[39:56.360 --> 40:02.200]  africa and they completely deleted that information from their website altogether so i mean david do
[40:02.200 --> 40:07.320]  you think this this process of deleting information which we've seen in a couple of other cases in
[40:07.320 --> 40:13.480]  fact the german virologist who went public and said that basically this this wouldn't end until
[40:13.480 --> 40:19.800]  the population of libiria was basically wiped out he talked about five million dead his quotes
[40:19.800 --> 40:26.600]  were later removed from that article when we highlighted them in an info wars dot com article so
[40:26.600 --> 40:32.360]  i mean david do you think this attempt to remove information is part of a deliberate cover-up or
[40:32.360 --> 40:38.840]  is it just a botched attempt to prevent hysteria it is a deliberate cover-up i believe it goes
[40:38.840 --> 40:42.840]  beyond just trying to control hysteria look he could control hysteria by telling people
[40:44.040 --> 40:47.480]  educating people so that they would understand what their risk was he wants to go into the
[40:47.480 --> 40:52.920]  apartment and he wants to tell people but i think it's safe because it's been so many days
[40:52.920 --> 40:57.400]  but instead he just says there's nothing to worry about there is zero risk and they're
[40:57.400 --> 41:02.680]  like you pointed out they're removing information they're also pushing this narrative that we're
[41:02.680 --> 41:07.720]  going to somehow be saved by pharmaceuticals if you look at the article that's up on
[41:08.360 --> 41:12.520]  us a today and i'm trying to find it here my stack of articles i got so much information here but
[41:12.520 --> 41:18.520]  they basically what they were focusing on was the various times that people have been given
[41:18.520 --> 41:24.440]  experimental drugs what they don't tell you is that dr kent brantley and the lady that was also
[41:24.440 --> 41:29.960]  working with him who were both given z-map who both recovered i don't know about her but he was
[41:29.960 --> 41:34.120]  definitely given a blood transfusion at the same time that he received that experimental drug
[41:34.920 --> 41:39.640]  two others were also given that experimental drug one of them and they both died in other
[41:39.640 --> 41:45.560]  countries one of them was a spanish priest where now we see that ebola has transferred to somebody
[41:45.560 --> 41:50.280]  for the first time outside of africa so not only did he die but now there's one person
[41:50.280 --> 41:55.480]  there was reports yesterday about a possible second person i don't know if that's changed or not yet
[41:56.280 --> 42:00.920]  but at least one person has contracted ebola there and that was from a patient who was treated
[42:00.920 --> 42:05.640]  with z-map and subsequently died now there's another experimental drug that was used on another
[42:05.640 --> 42:12.520]  doctor uh that was different from that uh he subsequently was cured but he also received
[42:12.520 --> 42:17.640]  a blood transfusion he was sent a blood transfusion from dr kent brantley the fellow who recovered
[42:17.640 --> 42:23.880]  because he uh had received that transfusion from a patient that he had treated in liberia
[42:23.880 --> 42:29.080]  he sent that to him so that doctor also received a blood transfusion from someone who had recovered
[42:29.080 --> 42:34.680]  who had antibodies in their plasma and at the same time that he got the experimental drug
[42:34.680 --> 42:39.400]  now he is back in the hospital they were saying that it is not a recurrence of ebola they weren't
[42:39.400 --> 42:43.240]  saying exactly what it was but today it was interesting in this us a today article they
[42:43.240 --> 42:49.880]  said the fda has blocked any further trials of that judge of that drug because it produces
[42:49.880 --> 42:56.600]  some severe flu like symptoms so it may be that it is secondary side effects of that drug that
[42:56.600 --> 43:01.320]  maybe it did cure him of ebola but there are these secondary side effects and then there's
[43:01.320 --> 43:08.280]  this new drug that they're using on mr duckin and dallas the librarian patient and that is a drug
[43:08.280 --> 43:14.840]  that they have used in the past to treat viruses and although it has killed it in in vitro in a
[43:14.840 --> 43:21.080]  glass there is absolutely no evidence that it has been responsive in treating it in people
[43:21.080 --> 43:25.080]  and i don't know if they've done any animal testing or not so that's really kind of a wild
[43:25.080 --> 43:31.400]  shot that they're just putting out there so i mean in 2009 with the swine flu we saw this huge
[43:31.400 --> 43:37.160]  hysteria there were reports of potentially troops on the streets uh in reaction to this to this
[43:37.160 --> 43:42.600]  hysteria which could occur the difference then is they had the the drug the vaccine lined up
[43:42.600 --> 43:49.000]  and everybody took it even though only elderly sick and young people were at risk of contracting
[43:49.000 --> 43:55.560]  swine flu so for the large majority of the population of the global population that wasn't a threat at
[43:55.560 --> 44:00.760]  the time they played it up like it was doomsday like it was the end of the world with the ebola
[44:00.760 --> 44:06.280]  crisis here we've seen a slow burn do you think david that they're they're really going to ramp
[44:06.280 --> 44:11.960]  up the hysteria once they get a drug in place whether it's effective or not i absolutely
[44:11.960 --> 44:15.720]  believe that's what they're waiting for and as a matter of fact we covered last week on the
[44:15.720 --> 44:23.480]  nightly news there was information that the gates foundation and several pharmaceutical companies
[44:23.480 --> 44:30.280]  were coming together to mass produce the z-map vaccine the one that is basically had a 50 success
[44:30.280 --> 44:34.920]  rate so far and you can't necessarily even say that it's that high because as i pointed out at
[44:34.920 --> 44:39.560]  least one of the patients who recovered one of the two uh had also received a blood transfusion
[44:39.560 --> 44:44.600]  but they are ramping up to produce that massively and of course that is something that is genetically
[44:44.600 --> 44:51.000]  uh there's a lot of genetic modification uh transgenetic uh modification going on with the process
[44:51.000 --> 44:57.000]  of that drug at the moment it is a plant-based genetic modification but they're getting ready
[44:57.000 --> 45:03.640]  to move it to an animal-based genetic modification which brings up all kinds of issues about rushing
[45:03.640 --> 45:08.600]  to market with something like this and creating a panic or forcing people to take this kind of
[45:08.600 --> 45:14.840]  vaccine i'd point out that this drug that is being given to doctor or to mr. Duncan now in
[45:14.840 --> 45:21.800]  Dallas is also i believe genetically modified to the company they created is called chimerics
[45:21.800 --> 45:26.840]  that might be as to what they're focused on they call they biopharmaceutical company so
[45:26.840 --> 45:32.200]  not a really good sign there as to what's really involved there but it has been effective at the
[45:32.200 --> 45:39.240]  adenovirus uh interesting that back in march there was a young boy who was suffering from
[45:39.240 --> 45:44.440]  cancer he had a marrow blood marrow a marrow transfusion and got the adenovirus and they
[45:44.440 --> 45:50.680]  could not get access to that under compassionate use they had to create a social media campaign
[45:50.680 --> 45:59.400]  they got 24 000 29 000 signatures on facebook and basically forced the company and the FDA to
[45:59.400 --> 46:04.520]  allow this young boy to have that he subsequently recovered but they knew that it was effective
[46:04.520 --> 46:08.200]  against the adenovirus it had been tested for quite some time against that this is a completely
[46:08.920 --> 46:14.120]  new experiment that they don't know about now this this story which i read this morning again
[46:14.120 --> 46:19.480]  it's not out of the onion it sounds like it could be but they're actually sending the the step daughter
[46:19.480 --> 46:27.080]  of patient zero the Ebola victim in Dallas back to work as a nursing assistant seven days after
[46:27.080 --> 46:34.440]  they first detected this Ebola case of course we know 21 days is the maximum up until when Ebola
[46:34.440 --> 46:39.800]  symptoms can be detected they can remain dormant until then we've also got reports that people
[46:39.800 --> 46:45.240]  can carry Ebola without showing symptoms and be able to infect other people that was a new
[46:45.240 --> 46:51.000]  york times article and indeed a scientific study which was published in the Lancet back in 2000
[46:51.000 --> 46:58.440]  and yet the CDC has told this nursing assistant that she can go back and work in a hospital
[46:58.440 --> 47:05.000]  despite the fact that she was exposed to this Ebola victim she handled the towels the bedsheets the
[47:05.640 --> 47:11.480]  vomit the blood stained material that this Ebola victim had been in contact with she
[47:11.480 --> 47:17.880]  rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital um david night i mean another example of the
[47:17.880 --> 47:24.040]  CDC i mean it gets to a point where this doesn't even look like dropping the ball anymore it looks
[47:24.040 --> 47:29.880]  like deliberate incompetence absolutely um that's a very good case in point if you look at the two
[47:29.880 --> 47:33.720]  families that were involved there there are two households that were put under quarantine uh
[47:33.720 --> 47:38.760]  incidentally neither of them after they were put into quarantine were given any food uh even
[47:38.760 --> 47:44.280]  Judge Tinkins was talking about how compassionate he was that was given by uh private uh agencies
[47:44.280 --> 47:48.440]  by the red cross and when the people brought it in of course they were not wearing protective clothing
[47:48.440 --> 47:53.640]  nevertheless the two different households uh one of them were the people who were directly living
[47:53.640 --> 47:59.400]  in that apartment that he was staying in she got involved this stepdaughter got involved because
[47:59.400 --> 48:05.400]  she sent her children over there on a friday night uh while he was very sick and that i believe was
[48:05.400 --> 48:10.280]  the day before and that was the day that he went to the hospital the first time when she found out
[48:10.280 --> 48:15.480]  that he was sick she had her children taken back but then she went on sunday to take care of him
[48:15.480 --> 48:19.720]  as she pointed out there's a a very detailed narrative from the new york times talking about
[48:19.720 --> 48:23.800]  how she bought bought him a blanket wrapped him in the blanket took care of him and she was a one
[48:23.800 --> 48:28.280]  who got the ambulance to come because he didn't want to go back to the hospital again he had been
[48:28.280 --> 48:32.120]  there and they had just basically sent him away without doing anything so he was reluctant to go
[48:32.120 --> 48:38.120]  back when the as a nurse uh when the ambulance drivers came in she said don't come in unless
[48:38.120 --> 48:43.720]  you put on gloves and a mask he's been to liberia and there may be viruses she didn't use the term
[48:43.720 --> 48:49.160]  ebola so she was very much involved with his care uh they didn't say that she wrote in the
[48:49.160 --> 48:55.320]  ambulance with him but she took the blanket that he had been sick in with her to the hospital
[48:55.320 --> 49:02.200]  and set it there in the emergency room with her where she was now they have not ever taken really
[49:02.200 --> 49:06.440]  the position that she couldn't that she was totally quarantined like her children they continued to
[49:06.440 --> 49:10.840]  allow these children to go to school for another couple of days then took them out then put temperature
[49:10.840 --> 49:17.080]  monitors in the schools where these children had gone then they told this lady and her husband
[49:17.080 --> 49:22.760]  that they could go to the stores to get groceries but the kids had to stay in the house then seven
[49:22.760 --> 49:27.400]  days later and that is the very minimum time i've seen anywhere most of the places say you will not
[49:27.400 --> 49:33.400]  manifest symptoms until eight to ten days later and as long as 21 days later but the cdc tells her
[49:33.400 --> 49:39.160]  seven days after exposure go back and work as a health care worker i mean that is when you look
[49:39.160 --> 49:45.240]  very worse situation to be absolutely absolutely it's just mind boggling what they have done
[49:45.800 --> 49:52.280]  and yet they're making a a hero out of we're seeing articles in time magazine in the washington post
[49:52.280 --> 49:58.120]  talking about how this judge is fighting fear and ebola and dallas and how courageous he is and
[49:58.120 --> 50:02.520]  how he's taking the lead in all of this there was an interesting article i mentioned to you
[50:02.520 --> 50:09.160]  that i saw in form policy talking about the toxic politics of ebola and the subtitle said in guinea
[50:09.160 --> 50:13.240]  the epidemic isn't just killing people it's threatening to tear the country apart in other
[50:13.240 --> 50:18.040]  words it's not just that people are dying we could lose our political power here which is really
[50:18.040 --> 50:23.000]  all they care about and that's why we're seeing the kinds of responses it's to bolster the
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.520]  political people as well as to make money for the pharmaceutical companies once they get a drug
[50:28.520 --> 50:33.800]  they're going to come on with a full panic we've already seen a connecticut governor sign a bill
[50:33.800 --> 50:40.120]  giving himself authorization to use emergency force whenever he feels like it we'll be back
[50:40.120 --> 50:44.920]  in the next segment with more ebola news we've also got robert david steel coming up he of course
[50:44.920 --> 50:49.480]  made a very interesting prediction last month on the alex joneshow where he said that there would
[50:49.480 --> 50:54.840]  be an ebola false flag so we will question him on that we've also got anthony gucciardian studio

[53:55.080 --> 54:11.000]  before it's time to survive it's time to prepare
[54:11.000 --> 54:28.440]  we're back it's Tuesday October 7th Alex Jones show live still talking about the latest Ebola news
[54:28.440 --> 54:33.000]  with David Knight here in studio and just during the break we were making the point that you know
[54:33.640 --> 54:39.320]  old bomber has said that they're going to enforce these new measures these customs protection agents
[54:39.320 --> 54:46.520]  at the airports are going to check people for signs of Ebola probably a week too late in that
[54:46.520 --> 54:50.840]  case obviously we know from the from the previous CNN report that they're not even doing that they're
[54:50.840 --> 54:57.080]  not even asking basic questions but don't worry because the TSA is still going to grope your junk
[54:57.080 --> 55:02.760]  they're still going to confiscate your alcohol tobacco and they're going to protect us from the
[55:02.760 --> 55:09.720]  deadly threat of snow globes that's all safe that's taken care of if you've got Ebola though
[55:09.720 --> 55:15.000]  you can go right on through no questions asked maybe they'll give you a questionnaire but this
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.560]  is the insanity of the CDC and the federal government's response now we've got an article
[55:19.560 --> 55:24.520]  up on drudge report dot com which is talking about how the troops are traveling there American
[55:24.520 --> 55:30.440]  troops in Liberia will come in direct contact with infected of course we've had hundreds of
[55:30.440 --> 55:37.240]  health workers in West Africa die as a result of being infected by Ebola victims despite the
[55:37.240 --> 55:42.440]  fact that they obviously would be expected to take the utmost precautions hundreds of health
[55:42.440 --> 55:47.640]  workers have died now thousands of American troops are going to be sent into harm's way
[55:48.200 --> 55:53.880]  to have direct contact with Ebola patients David Knight Paul you mentioned in the last you asked
[55:53.880 --> 56:00.120]  me in the last question section is this deliberate or is it just incompetence when you look at this
[56:00.120 --> 56:06.040]  policy of sending thousands of American troops into that area to have direct contact with people
[56:06.040 --> 56:10.760]  the military has said they're not equipped to deal with this that's not their mission
[56:10.760 --> 56:17.240]  to go do that so that is not just stupidity and that's incompetence that is deliberate exposure
[56:17.240 --> 56:23.240]  to people and so that alone will tell you what's behind all this but I think it's interesting
[56:23.240 --> 56:28.520]  you mentioned that the news media is reporting that Obama is going to step up his game in terms of
[56:28.520 --> 56:32.680]  screening at the airport the way the New York Times headlines that they say Ebola screening at
[56:32.680 --> 56:37.960]  airports will increase says Obama they're not doing it at all we just had that report you play in
[56:37.960 --> 56:43.000]  the first hour from the lady from CNN when she comes back and she says we were in Liberia we
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.680]  were covering Ebola and they go oh wait I think I heard something about that yeah watch yourself
[56:48.680 --> 56:52.280]  well what's there watch for I don't know I have no idea and they don't check the other people
[56:52.280 --> 56:57.560]  that are traveling with her even though they're also saying that she was appalled and amazed
[56:57.560 --> 57:04.440]  just like Chris Matthews was appalled and amazed that that Ebola even came here after he had
[57:04.440 --> 57:10.520]  assurances from Obama that it wouldn't happen so that's the kind of thing that we're being
[57:10.520 --> 57:16.920]  fed by the media as well as by Obama but it is a deliberate policy of exposure to spread this
[57:16.920 --> 57:21.880]  long I've also seen and I think this is tied to the deployment of the troops I saw an article
[57:21.880 --> 57:28.280]  in Stars and Stripes and it was an op-ed piece written by someone who was a consultant for the
[57:28.280 --> 57:35.320]  CFR a fellow rather at the CFR and she was saying that it's great that we have obama care because
[57:35.320 --> 57:40.440]  that's going to take care of Ebola because now anybody that's sick doesn't have any reluctance
[57:40.440 --> 57:47.320]  to go get health care and it's like really the combination of obama care and Ebola crossing
[57:47.320 --> 57:50.680]  our borders whether it's at the airports or whether it's coming through the southern border
[57:50.680 --> 57:57.400]  the combination of those two can destroy us not only financially but destroy millions of people
[57:57.400 --> 58:04.120]  it has that potential so it isn't that we somehow have a magical elixir obama care we have an
[58:04.120 --> 58:09.080]  a finite capacity both in terms of beds as we pointed out last week I think what was it 19
[58:09.080 --> 58:13.960]  beds in the United States that are isolation units only one in the UK even in western companies we
[58:13.960 --> 58:19.240]  have finite resources we can't treat everybody in the world but obama care pretends that we do and
[58:19.240 --> 58:24.520]  so does the military now we also got the the training in the hospitals they're saying they're
[58:24.520 --> 58:29.160]  completely unprepared for it US nurses are protesting about that we'll get into it after
[58:29.160 --> 58:35.880]  the break more with David night Robert David steel coming up next hour it's info wars.com stay tuned

[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:29.880]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:39.160]  we're back live on the alex jones show tuesday october 7th edition i'm filling in for alex today
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:45.000]  and paul josie foxen with david night in studio just mentioned this before the break reuters
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.240]  reports us nurses say they are unprepared to handle Ebola patients nurses the frontline care
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:57.480]  providers one of whom will be the Ebola victims step daughter shortly thanks to the cdc say they
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.720]  are untrained and unprepared to handle patients arriving in the hospital emergency departments
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:08.600]  infected with Ebola so we've heard these assertions these these claims by the cdc that the hospitals
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:14.040]  are all prepared yet around a week ago we in fact had nurses protesting out on the street
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:19.000]  saying that they weren't prepared they weren't given proper training for Ebola and indeed the very
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.400]  hospital in dallas where thomas eric duncan arrived they had received Ebola training but of course it
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:31.080]  proved to be completely useless since they couldn't detect symptoms of Ebola even though he told them
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:36.120]  he had traveled from west africa they basically had not ignored the threat gave him some pills
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:40.440]  and sent him home but david night you're going to be back in the final hour to talk about some
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:46.440]  financial issues so let's tease that yeah there's some interesting updates and financial information
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.640]  we've had an increase in the budget deficit last year of over six percent we've got house prices
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:57.320]  house prices that are not recovering ben Bernanke can't even refinance his home and here's a guy who
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:02.680]  is making he's a multimillionaire in terms of his salary every year he's got a house that's a
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.960]  jumbo loan which should actually be easier to refinance but because of increased regulations
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:17.000]  in the wake of the the crash that we had in 2008 because they wanted to socialize the losses into
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.720]  these banks they came back and said but that's okay we'll we'll match that with increased regulation
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:27.400]  well those regulations are even keeping somebody who is refinance trying to refinance a home that
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:32.280]  is a very small portion of his income from from being able to do it the former head of the federal
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:38.520]  reserve and of course there's some new updates on the live war scandal which is probably one of the
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:44.360]  most corrupt and far-reaching scandals we've seen the financial community since i can remember
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:50.600]  because the live war is the basis on which interest rates are set up for adjustable interest rates
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:56.920]  and people gaming that system made billions and billions of dollars of profit off of other people
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.800]  so there's some update on that as well that we'll have and i mean just on the economy obviously
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.360]  we had the the foreign affairs article which i discussed a few days ago they were talking about
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.880]  how median household income in the united states has basically stagnated since 1989
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.520]  people's living standards are either against stagnating or indeed dropping and they're very
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:21.400]  wary of this threat that's what they're scared could cause the populist uprising we're going to
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.720]  get into that with robert david steel after the break but david i mean just having been here nine
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:31.960]  years ago before the financial collapse i noticed that there's basically a panhandler on every other
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:38.200]  corner in austin texas it really seems that there's there's more poverty in evidence since before
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:45.400]  the financial collapse back in 2008 well actually the economy here in austin is quite strong compared
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.480]  to other places i think a lot of these panhandlers are coming here because of the weather because of
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.120]  the strong economy and because of kind of the attitude perhaps of the police department some
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.280]  places they really crack down on them in some places they take a more of a laissez faire approach but
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:04.520]  the real estate market here especially in austin is very strong compared to the rest of the country
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.680]  if you look at house prices this essentially come back to the peak here and in south north
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:17.320]  dakota where there's a energy-based economy where it plays a large part of the economy
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:23.480]  but in many other places they're looking at housing prices that are down 15 percent 33
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:29.480]  percent in florida i think it's like 15 percent in california that they've plummeted that's a very
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:35.080]  serious matter because that's more equity than most people have and when you add a trillion dollars
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:41.080]  in just one year to the deficit as we just did that is going to create an economic malaise that
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:46.120]  we're not going to get out of i'm going to be back david's going to be back in studio final hour
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:51.480]  to cover some more news issues but coming up in the next segment robert david steel to talk about

[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:46.200]  david steel who i'm very excited to talk to having recently read his book the open source
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:53.480]  everything manifesto robert david steel former cia clandestine services case officer activist
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:59.320]  and promoter of open source intelligence and we're going to get into ebola the open source
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.920]  everything manifesto and more mr steel welcome to the show hey please call me robert i'm
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:10.520]  glad to be here it's good to have you two weeks ago roughly you came on the alex jones show and
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:17.320]  talked about a potential ebola false flag event of course two weeks before the first case emerged in
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:23.080]  the united states is that what we're seeing unfold now in the aftermath of this dallas case
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:29.080]  i think it's too soon to tell i mean when when when i was hearing the chatter about a false
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:35.960]  flag that was prior to ebola becoming actually a very serious threat spawned in large part because
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:43.960]  of the incompetence of the cdc i believe the cdc is lying to the president and misrepresenting
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:50.600]  the danger and right now that has moved ahead of false flag as as my concept of what the greatest
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:56.520]  threat is so do you think this is going to tie into any kind of october surprise obviously
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:02.200]  we've got the midterm elections coming up do you see the ebola threat whether it be hijacked or
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:07.160]  or you know exploited by the administration playing a part in those midterm elections
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:11.880]  or could we indeed see some kind of other a false flag incident that could play a role
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.280]  well there are always false flags going on i mean the the the one that still
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:23.400]  rings my chimes is the fbi trying to bribe a a retarded muslim kid into leaving his mother
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:30.040]  and starting a cell paying him three thousand dollars to do that false flag is a deep part of
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:36.840]  the american government psyche at least among the rogue elements um your october surprise is
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:42.120]  interesting of course somebody is going to try and do something to influence the elections but
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:48.440]  right now i think everything is pointing toward the the um the republicans retaking the senate
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:54.040]  obama has lost the initiative he's giving no semblance of having a coherent government that
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:11:00.120]  knows what it's doing the intelligence community is an abject failure tom engelhardt just wrote a
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:06.280]  brilliant book which i'll review shortly as well as a brilliant article uh on the failure of the
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:15.960]  intelligence community uh so right now whether obama let me just say ebola is going to play
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:22.600]  in the elections you're absolutely right uh whether false flag plays in i don't know what is
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.160]  certain is that the u.s. government is giving every evidence of being totally incompetent
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:32.360]  and this will assuredly hurt the administration we're talking to robert david steel the website
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:37.640]  by the way is five beta iota dot net we can get that up on screen for people there you see it the
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:43.080]  public intelligence blog now of course you wrote the book the open source everything manifesto
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:48.520]  which we're going to get into shortly but there's also a pretty good article by a nefisa med i believe
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:52.600]  out of the guardian which kind of summarized what you pointed out in that book and some of the
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:57.400]  speeches you gave afterwards you gave a speech earlier this year in which you said that all the
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:04.680]  major preconditions for revolution which you originally set out back in 1976 were now present
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:09.880]  both in the united states and britain they see the article out of the guardian the open source
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:16.600]  revolution is coming and it will conquer the 1% x cia spy so in terms of these preconditions for
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:22.760]  revolution highlight exactly what some of those are and give us a you know an idea of the timescale
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:28.680]  that we're looking at in terms of this revolution as you call it i'd be very glad to do that but
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:33.720]  let me just come back and close the loop with you on obola because i see four separate distinct
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:39.160]  threats on obola all four from very very bad for both the public and the administration the first
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:45.480]  of course is cdc malfeasance just to give you an example the the n85 mask or whatever it is
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:52.360]  they're recommending uh that will stop things that are three microns in size obola is 0.08
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:59.000]  microns in size so they are severely misleading the first responders and the health professionals
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:06.440]  cdc is not being honest uh the second is saudi importation of obola through the uh through the
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:13.560]  saudi diplomatic pouch and then uh infecting uh 20 saudi students distributed across the
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.920]  united states among the 100 000 or more saudi students that are in universities across the
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:25.640]  country uh the third is the false flag which is still up there for me um and the fourth is actually
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:31.160]  a successful isis martyr initiative in which people generally western and appearance are
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:35.720]  brought in through airplanes because we're not screening at airports and neither is the united
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:41.800]  kingdom now coming back to your preconditions a revolution i did my first thesis on this and
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:46.520]  and it's all available free online at five beta iota but the bottom line is concentration of
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:53.720]  wealth loss of legitimacy of the government um severe unemployment the actual unemployment rate
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:59.960]  in the united states is 22.4 percent according to shadow stats dot com not the ridiculous
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.600]  six to seven percent that the administration claims and then their whole wealth of other
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:10.760]  ideal cultural and techno demographic conditions which include very young people coming out with
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:16.520]  a college degree and not being able to get work older people like me not being able to get work
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:23.560]  and our veterans i cannot overemphasize how much the us government fears our veterans because
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:30.920]  these people are armed dangerous and their patriotism cannot be questioned uh so we have all
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:36.200]  of the preconditions of revolution in the united states what we do not have an Ebola or a major
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:42.280]  failure in Ebola as perceived by the public what we do not have is a precipitate for moving the
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.400]  people into the streets and actually firing every sitting congressman and and actually
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:53.880]  reelecting someone new just for the sake of having someone new so do you think you know the us is
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:59.560]  going to see a tunisian fruit cell a moment or is it more kind of a general malaise a lowering of
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:04.920]  living standards as you said a collapse in the economy is it going to be just going to break
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:10.840]  um there are a lot of there are a lot of bad things about to happen i'll give you one simple
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:18.120]  example uh there is a huge fracking bubble in wall street in the city of london a great many
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:23.240]  fracking wells have been dug they're being sold on the derivatives marketplace and what people
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:29.880]  don't realize is that fracking is on and off on or off it's not it's not a smooth decline
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:37.960]  in production the way uh natural gas and and oil is fracking you get it or you don't and so what's
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.360]  going to happen here is all of a sudden the city of london and wall street the people who are buying
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.160]  these things are going to realize that they've been sold a bill of goods with fracking wells that
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:53.160]  will not produce that will run out and that could set off a new financial panic uh you combine that
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:58.600]  with a bowl that you combine that with a thousand wells going dry across california and texas is
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:05.560]  arizona and you're really beginning to see what could become a perfect storm probably not before
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:14.600]  the elections in november but possibly uh we are in my 62 years the united states of america is as
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:21.240]  low as i have ever seen it get in every possible respect and in terms of this perfect storm that
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:27.960]  you just mentioned um i wrote an article last week which was based on a series of essays in the cfr's
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:33.640]  publication foreign affairs and basically they acknowledge that this populist uprising these
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:39.160]  preconditions for revolution both on the right and the left um with the tea party with the occupy
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:44.680]  movement and the anti-eu movement in europe were coalescing there you see the article
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:49.720]  establishment desperate to co-opt populist uprising so they acknowledge that there's this american
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:55.080]  distemper growing as you have documented but in their own words they said quote that they've got
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:01.720]  to co-opt this uprising and kind of squirrel it away into issues of little or no significance so
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.920]  so as to quell the american distemper i mean how do you think they're going to try because of course
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:11.880]  we know to a certain extent with the arab spring with some of the other uprisings they there were
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:17.800]  attempts to co-opt them by the establishment do you see a similar process occurring in the united
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:23.880]  states and throughout europe you've you've raised what for me is the single most important and
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:28.920]  interesting possibility in this century i mean you've you've really brought up something that we
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:35.960]  could talk about for hours um as as you know as well as anyone uh during the student uprisings in
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:44.040]  the 1960s the cia funded a wide variety of student movements and the whole idea was to let a thousand
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:50.600]  flowers bloom so they wouldn't talk to each other and that has been the strategy of the of the foundations
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:56.600]  as well uh there's an article out about the NGOization of everything which basically means
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:05.880]  fragment them all um mica safari uh safari um i'm sorry um mica sifri has just published this book
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:13.400]  which is an absolutely utterly brilliant book um that is not available on amazon i i think the
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.120]  publisher is to be castigated for that it's one of the single most important books i've read in
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:24.840]  the last few years and what it says is that all of the nonprofit organizations from echo villages
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:30.760]  to intentional communities to uh energy uh and education and health foundations they are all
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:36.600]  fragmented they all want to use their hashtag they refuse to actually share information have a
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:41.800]  common strategy and come out so the foundations have succeeded now let me give you what i think
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:50.920]  is the 64 trillion dollar bonanza the elites have broken ranks lady roth child in london has
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:57.240]  sponsored a conference on inclusive capitalism the mars family has just sponsored a journal
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:03.080]  issue of the brewery called mutuality economics and there are a number of billionaires on the west
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.080]  coast what i call the black sheep billionaires and i understand there's some black sheep billionaires
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:13.480]  in europe as well that are talking about redemptive capitalism what this boils down to is the elites
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:19.320]  are now divided i would say roughly three quarters of the elites still think that they can just trash
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:24.920]  everybody and fragment everybody and continue business as usual for for the next decade that's
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:31.560]  not going to happen um the smarter elites the elites that understand that the pitchforks are
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:37.960]  there and that there aren't enough guns to hold back everybody those elites that small handful of
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:45.080]  elites is opening the possibility for people like me to be heard um and i thank you for the exposure
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:53.640]  on the alex jones show because i believe that we can preserve protect and not attack the existing
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:58.600]  concentrated wealth as long as the elites will fund okay we'll be back after the very

[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:34.040]  oxen talking to robert david steel the website is fight beta iota net former cia case officer
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:39.320]  who of course wrote the excellent book which i read recently the open source everything manifesto
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.640]  robert you got cut off just on the break there we were talking about how the elite plan to quote
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:49.000]  co-opt this populist uprising or these preconditions for revolution just finish your point on that
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:55.080]  well thank you because what i was trying to stress was that the elite have broken ranks
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:00.040]  lady roth trials in london has sponsored a conference on inclusive capitalism
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:06.200]  the mars family which has been an honest wealthy family for a very long time has sponsored a journal
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:11.880]  issue on mutuality economics which means everybody needs to get ahead and finally what the what i call
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:16.440]  the black sheep billionaires on the west coast and also in europe are talking about redemptive
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:23.800]  capitalism so i believe there's a a way forward in which we can get a segment of the elite to sponsor
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:31.560]  open source everything to sponsor um a a unification of all of us under an umbrella strategy to
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:37.160]  create infinite wealth for the five billion poor it'll be a different kind of uh it won't even be
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:43.080]  capitalism it'll be focused on land and labor uh so i actually feel very positive i think that
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.600]  we're moving toward a perfect storm and out of that perfect storm will become will come an entire
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:55.000]  new economy and i'm tentatively adopting the mars family uh concept of mutuality economics
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:26:00.920]  and in your book i believe when you talk about the five million million five billion poor sorry
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:06.440]  this is a process of um you know educating them arming them with cell phones with the internet
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:11.000]  with information and i believe you make the point that the elite simply won't be able to cope with
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.240]  the tide of five billion more awake informed individuals is that the case well yes and and
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:22.440]  vatlav havel has written an excellent book called power of the powerless and and howards in of course
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:28.920]  wrote the power government cannot suppress um five billion poor people right now are being
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.640]  blocked from creating infinite wealth because the vestiges of capitalism particularly in the
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:41.480]  telecommunications and computing arena um are they're like a quagmire they're like a big mud
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:48.280]  tar pit into which the dinosaurs will sink so open base transceiver station which is open free cell
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:53.480]  phones is one of the first steps toward unleashing the five billion poor and there's some wonderful
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.440]  work being done on this in mexico and other places and there are other opens that will
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:04.760]  essentially allow the five billion poor to take their time energy equation and turn it into infinite
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:09.880]  wealth this i am absolutely certain of i'm going to take your calls for robert david steel at one
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:17.560]  800 259 92 31 after the break but his book the open source everything manifesto robert let's just
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:23.160]  break that down what is the open source manifesto from the blurb it's it's the transition from top
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:27.880]  down secret command and control to a world of bottom up consensual collective decision making
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:33.160]  as a means to solve the major crises facing our will today so how does this top down system of
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:40.200]  control currently operate and how can we begin to turn it around well it operates because we've
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:46.440]  allowed it to operate uh we've allowed the fencing of the commons the criminalization of private
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:53.480]  behavior we've allowed governments to basically dictate what we should do and and how we are
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:59.000]  educated and so forth what is happening now is that states are failing in a big way and i certainly
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:07.240]  include the united states in the united kingdom as states of questionable viability um localization
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:15.160]  is coming up uh in new york to take an example fracking is forbidden by most of the towns and
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:19.720]  villages across the entire state in new york and this is driving the fracking industry which is a
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:30.280]  criminal industry uh crazy um what i see is an end of top down a an end of secrecy uh and a rise of
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:36.600]  local face-to-face politics and local face-to-face economics in which money is pulled out of the
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:41.960]  remote banking system in fact i would say absentee banks absentee landlords and absentee
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:49.720]  governments are going to be on the uh trash heap of history and just bring us the origins of this this
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:55.400]  was a 1992 conference where you first introduced these ideas and i believe you got a lot of pushback
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:01.800]  from the cia tell us about that well it's good of you to actually look at the history um i left
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:07.000]  the cia to create the marine core intelligence center and i paid 20 million dollars for my
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.880]  analyst to have access to all of the secrets and i had a small pc over in a corner and to my

[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:32.360]  live on the alex jones show i'm paul joseph opson info wars dot com for the latest breaking news
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:38.440]  we're talking to robert david steel former cia officer and author of the open source everything
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:43.480]  manifesto robert we've got a long segment now so feel free to elaborate but we were just touching
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:49.400]  on it before the break you had this landmark conference in 1992 where despite opposition
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:55.800]  from the cia you got to get together all these um intelligence professionals basically 620 of them
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:01.240]  and gave them this this lecture on the open source manifesto so let's try and break down
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:06.600]  what exactly the open source transformation represents and why it represents also such
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:11.880]  a threat to the establishment well i i love the way you've done your homework and i i thank you
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:16.520]  for that uh let's start with the fact that cia when it first agreed to my conference said that
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:22.440]  they would come only if it was secret and us citizens only and i had to go to admiral stuteman
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.080]  and admiral stuteman god bless him supported me and informed cia that they would attend
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:36.760]  um cia calls me open source s o r e s uh they see open source as a major threat
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:43.000]  because a great deal of the mystique of cia which which i love as an organization i want to save it
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:52.280]  in in many ways it's an important place uh but cia is living a lie apart from the atrocities
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:57.320]  that they're committing with drones and rendition and torture which i have opposed from day one
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:02.360]  they're not actually collecting secret intelligence they're taking handouts from foreign liaison
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:09.160]  they're doing legal traveler debriefings they don't know anything they have children um being spoon
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:16.120]  fed secrets that cover less than three percent of what we need to know um so essentially alvin
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:22.520]  toford called me the rival's store when he wrote a chapter about the future of the spy in 1993
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:27.320]  i'm still the rival's store but frankly i'd like to come in and do a hostile takeover and get these
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:34.360]  people cleaned up um we need intelligence intelligence's decision support i've written
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:39.000]  an article in counterpunch called intelligence for the president and everyone else and let
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.280]  me stop there and throw it back to you bottom line is decision support is what would be saving
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:49.480]  us from abola it would keep the americans from invading the middle east again it would keep the
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:55.960]  government honest we don't have intelligence because we don't have integrity and from what i've
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:01.400]  read in your book i mean it's it's this attitude of intelligence being an enclosed community and
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:08.200]  the cia and other agencies placing so much credence in this secret intel that they then ignore the vast
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:13.720]  majority of open sense open source intelligence which in many cases is more accurate than that
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:18.520]  secret intel because that's an echo chamber is that correct well you're you're you're absolutely
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:23.960]  right and it's it's really two parts the the first part is the intelligence community knows nothing
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:30.520]  um i am i am appalled as an intelligence professional and from the 1990s i was outlining
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.240]  precisely what needed to be done in order to make it a serious professional community and and i was
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:41.320]  ignored in part because my ideas would have been grounds for tripling the amount of intelligence
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:47.560]  we could produce and cutting the budget in half the intelligence community is a secret pork pie
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.920]  that's all it is it moves the money as bill benny and others have said and i really want to
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:59.960]  encourage everyone to look up uh tom engelbart's new article just out today called failure is success
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:05.400]  engelbart has rendered a huge national service in in publishing that article and i've written a
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:10.760]  very strong comment at the end of it the other half of the problem which paul pilar has addressed in
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:16.600]  his book is that the white house does not make policy based on intelligence it makes policy
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:22.520]  based on who has paid to be heard so we have traders running the u.s government we have financial
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:29.640]  traders ideological traders and religious traders and these people are not scrubbed out because the
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:35.400]  fbi has essentially been put in a straight jacket and is not allowed to do its job let's like a
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:43.400]  quick call for robert david steele janaro in arizona you're on the air go ahead yes hi paul hi uh robert
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:49.640]  uh i first of all i want to tell paul thank you for your work i really appreciate all the work
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:55.240]  that you do on info wars as well as the entire team there and robert thank you for your work
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:00.920]  over your entire career you're a true um hero and your activism for the american people
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:11.080]  so my question um is for robert uh yesterday paul i had sent in an email um bringing out
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:20.120]  the flagrant disregard of um the judge judge dankens in how he handled going to the apartment
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:29.240]  with no protection whatsoever but yet he had everybody in the entire apartment quarantined
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:34.440]  taking out their items but he himself doesn't have to get quarantined he himself does not
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.840]  have to wear any protection so my question is uh robert do you think that this is that
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:48.280]  false flag event that you mentioned um in that they would uh simulate an Ebola attack in which they
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:55.160]  use biochemical weapons that dissipate and pretend that it's Ebola because who in their right mind
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:39:02.120]  would walk into an apartment that has Ebola everywhere from the guy that was living in that
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:10.520]  apartment with vomit and diarrhea and blood everywhere and put his life as such risk and put
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:17.240]  everybody else that he comes in contact with at risk i think you've got a you've got a very good
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:24.520]  point uh and in fact i've outlined four distinct uh possibilities as we face this Ebola threat
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:32.360]  and and that uh that blog is is at uh at five beta iota and you can look it up as roberts
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:38.520]  feel Ebola today alex jones today um so i've outlined four specifics and there's absolutely
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:45.320]  nothing to prevent a blending of these four certainly i expect people to do some false flag
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:52.440]  uh drills um homeland security is famous for wanting to take the head uh take the uh headlines
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:57.640]  and and be active and be seen as doing something and i think you have identified something that's
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:03.160]  called an indicator i don't think the judge is stupid i think very talented people tend to
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:07.880]  become judges and and they tend to have a lot of influence a lot of smarts so the judge has
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:14.360]  basically shown us that he is so unconcerned about Ebola that it probably is not Ebola in this
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:19.320]  specific instance okay thanks for the call um just want to switch to a different topic before
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:23.240]  we throw back to the callers and that is an article that appeared on your website
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:30.200]  david labeling truth seekers as conspiracy theorists and this was about the uh the conspiracy
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:35.560]  theory term and how it's been weaponized as a tool as a pejorative to demonize freedom of thought
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:40.600]  just get into that for a moment for us well i i have to give credit to the cia i mean there was
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:45.720]  a time when i was a covert operations specialist and and media influence operations were part of
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:51.960]  what i did although i was focused mostly on international opinion and and and uh basically
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:58.840]  crafting the worldwide opinion on el Salvador uh so cia coined this conspiracy theorist term
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:05.000]  and the whole idea is to marginalize people now if your readers want or if your viewers want to
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:13.160]  go to phi beta iota and use the search box they can enter the words conspiracy and sane and they
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:18.440]  will immediately get to some wonderful headlines from many other people i don't post a lot myself
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:25.240]  on the on the on the website i curate about 80 others that post um the bottom line is there
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:32.840]  have been 33 conspiracy theories so labeled that have been proven true and the research is now out
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:38.920]  showing that people who have been labeled conspiracy theorists are by and large not only more intelligent
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:48.520]  but correct in relation to the facts and this is of course the foundation was a 1967 document i believe
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:55.640]  from the cia which utilized the conspiracy theory term to demonize any questioning of the Warren
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:02.280]  commission narrative so as far back as 67 they were set on using this term as a pejorative
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:08.360]  to silence any criticism of any official narrative and of course in that case with the assassination
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:13.400]  of jfk let's go to another call for robert david steel mike in california you're on the air go ahead
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:19.240]  yeah two quick questions for the guest um one was he mentioned about uh
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:27.960]  which is just possible for uh in texas and possibly for uh elections for the pr do you
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:34.520]  see the possibility of the hit term election basically a census used in the electronic
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:40.600]  voting for uh where they need to target uh false voting tally that's the first question the second
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:49.480]  one was when you mentioned the autonomy do you uh uh see uh network marketing or more multi-level
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:57.960]  marketing that's one of the avenues for the five billion or to uh be able to uh uh you know make
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:06.440]  a living or uh even prosper i'm sorry the call is so broken up i cannot understand
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:11.480]  robert he was saying do you see multi-level marketing as a tool which could be used by the
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:18.280]  five billion poor to empower themselves i i'm not even sure what that means what i see the five
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:25.160]  billion poor doing is dumping the entire western capitalist system on its ass because the five
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:29.640]  billion poor need two dollar refrigerators you can bury in the ground they don't need zero
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:34.440]  degree refrigerators in fact they don't need anything that we've got to offer
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:40.120]  they will create their own economy the un has just come out and said that the only sustainable
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:47.320]  agriculture is local organic agriculture um i believe in the um global village construction
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:53.880]  set in the use of open source design open source engineering um i believe that the five billion
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:59.720]  poor essentially going to create a new civilization that is much closer to that of the indigenous
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:07.080]  native americans uh than what we have now uh and if i understood vaguely the other question about
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:13.560]  the the election um i do believe that we will have a very corrupt election and i do believe
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:19.480]  that the republicans will dominate both the deep old machines that are completely totally
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:26.200]  um corrupt and i do believe that obama is going to be put in the box for the rest of his administration
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:32.200]  skits in nebraska you're on the air with robert david steele go ahead thank you kind sir for
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:36.680]  taking my call it's a good thing the guy on the other end of the telephone is as good looking
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:45.640]  as the one on this hand uh robert do you you come out with the best news that i have heard in the
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:53.720]  last 10 years now uh do you can you are you at liberty to give out the names of some of the
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:59.640]  black sheep billionaries you mentioned something like about the mars family is it spelled m a r s
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:07.000]  tell us about that well the mars family is not one of the black sheep billionaires um the black
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.800]  sheep billionaires for obvious reasons don't want to be well known by the gates and buffets of the
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:18.360]  world uh and i'm waiting to see what happens i'm only indirectly uh being told about them i don't
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:25.640]  have any direct connection what i do believe though is that there are a lot of really smart people in
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:31.960]  fact i just wrote uh an invited op-ed for the guardian and i want to outline four big pots of
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:38.600]  money that i see coming down the pike the united nations just got a commitment for 2.3 billion
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:45.560]  dollars for 17 sustainable development goals and they're thinking about how to how to manage that
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:51.960]  money so that they don't do what they usually do which is waste 80 percent of it on overhead and i
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:57.000]  hope that i will have a small role to play in helping them create an intelligence activity
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:02.680]  that is completely open that will help move the money directly to villages through electronic
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:09.320]  bank accounts and completely bypass the the corrupt NGO infrastructures that tend to go for
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:15.640]  salaries and lear jets and all this other stuff the second pot of money is the billionaires that
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:22.280]  i'm talking about the black sheep billionaires they're getting tired of giving money out to
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:29.000]  1400 michael bloomberg for example who is not a black sheep billionaire has given out uh over
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:35.560]  over 500 billion a million dollars to over 1400 non-government organizations what this means is
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:41.880]  he's giving out tokens he's not doing serious sustainable work but if we can get everybody
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:47.000]  to focus on an umbrella organization with a strategy and get all of these people to work
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.960]  together and to share information then there's some real possibilities the third big pot of
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:58.520]  money comes from CEOs they were recently pulled by oxford university and they're all realizing
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:04.040]  that the companies they are managing are dinosaurs that are about to die on a tar pit and they're
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:09.960]  all looking for ways to redirect capitalism so that it's actually sustainable and paul hawkins
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:16.520]  and herman daily would call this cradle to grave green capitalism and the last pot of money is
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:23.640]  the u.s. government i have gotten omb to agree twice to an open source agency and if obama wants
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:30.760]  my help in saving what's left of his administration to include saving the senate i know how to do that
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:36.840]  and i do that with an open source agency announced before the election and with electoral reform
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:42.760]  also announced before the election and robert i mean thanks for the call by the way um we've
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:49.240]  had comments recently from top u.s. ambassadors regarding russia of course the situation with
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:54.920]  ukraine escalated over the past six months or so saying that russia has been ostracized from quote
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:48:00.360]  the new world order do you see the bricks nations who are emerging financially of course and with
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:06.680]  the recent energy infrastructure projects as a genuine alternative to the unipolar system that
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:12.520]  currently rules the world or do you see that as not being particularly relevant to this general
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:18.920]  oh no no on the contrary the the the bricks are the alternative and then there's a third and a fourth
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:27.000]  alternative um the city of london and wall street gave it up uh i am absolutely stunned at the at
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  the libor scandal and the manner in which goldman sacks has been allowed to destroy multiple economies
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:38.520]  including the u.s. economy with absolutely no consequences for anybody of note uh at the highest
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:44.440]  levels um the bricks are creating their own internet their own world bank their own international
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:51.080]  development organization the bricks are smarter wealthier and tougher than we are but that's
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:56.520]  not something washington wants to hear they're in denial now let me also point out that russia is
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:04.360]  about to make huge strides in the arctic uh it has long been announced by russia that they were playing
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:09.560]  the long game and that the arctic was their financial reserve and there's some headlines out
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:14.280]  today and yesterday that essentially say that the russians have broken through to a major new
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:20.760]  oil field uh i anticipate the arctic becoming a major transportation hub across the north pole
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:26.280]  that will be owned by the russians not by the americans the the open ice is along the russian
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:33.320]  border not the canadian border um so for me if i were advising the strategic commander anybody
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:39.560]  with a brain in washington dc i would say get it get a grip on the truth the truth at any cost
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:46.680]  lowers all other costs and right now washington is living a catastrophic lie and we've recently
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:53.080]  seen comments from chinese pla officials regarding uh the west do you see the west as initiating
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:58.680]  violence against the bricks countries whether that be over ukraine or or any any situation in
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:05.480]  asia geopolitically as a means of curtailing their growing influence well you know i i for 15
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:10.840]  years i was a circuit rider for the u.s special operations command and i love special operations
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:18.040]  dearly but but i have to say special operations in its pure form is white it is pure it is good
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:25.160]  special operations has been severely corrupted by the move toward black assassination killer
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:31.560]  operations and i'm very distressed by what i see as a corrupt special operations in which
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.640]  we're taking kids right out of boot camp we're sending them into the field and we're doing
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:41.800]  indiscriminate killing what the americans don't seem to understand is that everybody else is at
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:48.280]  least as smart if not smarter than they are um yes we are going to be sponsoring rendition

[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:37.000]  steel go ahead yeah one quick point about the judge jenkins or two quick questions uh i saw a
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:44.200]  bright part article that something about dps uh investigation to the judge uh over exposing his
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.680]  daughter potentially to ebola i don't know if you guys have heard about that and then the quick
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:55.080]  questions i have is uh mr steel do you believe that uh or do you know obama might be our last
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:58.440]  president it's something that worries me greatly whether our country will make it or not and then
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:05.320]  i also want to ask about the depletion of our the u.s nuclear arms and meanwhile other countries
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:10.440]  like russia are ramping up massively while they're skirting our coasts with their bombers and and
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:17.880]  what not well we have not had a real president since john f kennedy was assassinated i've reviewed
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:25.160]  a number of books on the kennedy assassination we now know that he was killed by a team that included
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:32.360]  robin from israel george bush senior in dallas um j edger hoover the cuban mafia based in new
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:41.320]  orleans linden baines johnson um and every president since then has been essentially informed upon being
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:46.280]  entered into office that they will either do what they're told or they will be assassinated
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:52.760]  i'm told that jimmy carter cried his eyes out when he understood the reality here um so be
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:58.680]  under no illusions about obama actually being president um now having said that i have enormous
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:04.280]  faith in the average american and the goodness of the american people and i believe we're coming
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:11.000]  up to a perfect storm and out of this perfect storm i don't think it's possible to suborn the
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:17.640]  american people i think the only possible outcome of any perfect storm is new growth a resurrection
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:24.600]  a second american republic um on nuclear i don't really know much about that other than to say that
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:30.920]  in my view nuclear is not going to be used by anybody there are so many other ways to
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:36.440]  decapitate this country to include c4i i mean the dirty little secret of nsa is that the
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:42.040]  chinese have been riding the electrical circuits into their computers for 10 years so nsa is a
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:50.520]  joke it's a lie it just got too much power because nobody understood just how idiotic nsa is um so
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:56.040]  unbalanced please let me just go on the record i am an optimist about the next 10 years in america

[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:11.080]  defense department claimed despite the fact that health officials have failed to contain Ebola
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:16.200]  which is now spreading on multiple continents during a pentagon news conference today us army
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:21.320]  general david rodri where's the commander of us africa command african said the military is using
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:26.200]  quote strict protocols to protect the troops and will implement careful reintegration once they
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:32.760]  return to the us so we've had hundreds of health workers over in west africa become infected
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:37.960]  despite the fact that they would be normally expected to take the utmost precautions against
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:43.000]  the virus and yet now obama is sending in thousands of troops who will have direct contact with
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:49.560]  Ebola patients and the pentagon is already on the defensive as to whether those troops will
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:54.760]  receive adequate protection so a lot of questions being asked about that gonna go to more of your

[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:08.840]  a little bit of help and i just wanted to mention it since i was able to get through today and it
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:14.760]  starts at 36 27 on august 30th and he's pushing back on some very corrupt forces and i wanted to
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:19.720]  just give a shout out so people might could listen to that and last week's show he's on there as well
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:25.160]  okay thanks for the call rain california you're on the air go ahead well you're on the air go ahead
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:31.320]  ray yeah um i want to talk about a couple of things uh first of foremost i want to state that um
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:38.680]  they went after jesse ventura first and um they discredited them as you know and then what happened
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:44.120]  next is they removed conspiracy theory with jesse ventura from the entire internet i can't get access
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:51.240]  anywhere on youtube of the full length videos and if you go to two tv apps they won't allow you to
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:58.120]  rent them in the united states anymore they used to charge a dollar 99 and then at two tv's uh webpage
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:05.000]  you can't access any episodes either and then something happened to tyrell ventura he's no
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:11.320]  longer on buzzsaw and the last time he was on buzzsaw was april of 2014 so something may be going
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:17.880]  on with that all right exactly i mean we saw ventura ostracized from the huffington post a couple
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:22.680]  of years ago he wrote an article about 9 11 he was basically kicked off the huffington post they
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:28.520]  refused to carry his articles also with the conspiracy theory show of course they retroactively
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:33.720]  removed it from people's t-votes even though they'd already recorded the episode to their t-vo hard
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:41.240]  drives those episodes i think it was the fema camp episode was remotely deleted so definite censorship
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:47.320]  of information there uh with jesse ventura will continue to track it more of your calls coming
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:52.280]  up after the break we've got anthony gucciotti in studio to talk about more issues surrounding a

[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:35.960]  joseph what's in for alex jones on the alex jones show live tuesday october 7th edition
[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:40.600]  we're going to switch back to ebola now we've got the report out the guardian which just broke
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:45.560]  and it's health professionals in Madrid have blamed substandard equipment and a failure to
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:50.200]  follow protocol for the first case of Ebola to be contracted outside west africa so of course
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:57.000]  yesterday we had the spanish nurse who had treated the spanish priest infected with ebola up to 56
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:03.080]  other potential individuals exposed to ebola and it seems that just as in the united states the
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:09.320]  spanish hospital there in madrid was unprepared to receive this patient as nurses in the united
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:15.640]  states also claimed that they haven't received ebola training the hospital in dallas that took
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:21.400]  in patient zero last week they had got the training but obviously it was pretty useless
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:26.120]  because they sent him home with antibiotics even though he told them he had come from west africa
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:31.640]  and he was allowed to circulate in the local population potentially exposing others but
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:36.600]  were joined now in studio by anthony gucciotti to talk about some of the response and some of the
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:42.440]  natural treatments in relation to ebola anthony welcome to the show well thank you paul and
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:47.640]  isn't it amazing it's just a blame game with ebola they just say oh well it was someone else's fault
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:51.720]  it's not a big deal everyone just stay calm and i want to talk about some of the research that's
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:58.200]  out there some dating back to 2009 for natural plant compounds inhibiting some of the growth of ebola
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:03.160]  in animal studies and how no one's talked about that and what that really means and specifically
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:09.000]  which compounds but first i want to talk about this paradigm of illogical behavior this paradigm
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:16.280]  of nonsensical behavior by society at large by the mainstream media and i want to talk about how
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:21.640]  the media has now turned this whole situation into a debate when there's no debate it reminds me of
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:27.320]  the open borders it reminds me of the video that you guys did with joe biggs crossing the border
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:33.720]  dressed as osama bin laden with an isis flag with a decapitate decapitated human head walking
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:40.440]  across the border and there's now this magical debate of should we just let isis into the united
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:44.680]  state should we just keep the borders wide open and let that go on should the border patrol stand
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:50.040]  down because otherwise it could be racist it reminds me of this whole debate should we let
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:56.520]  people come in fly in from ebola affected countries who could even be exhibiting signs of ebola
[02:10:56.520 --> 02:11:01.400]  without even pre-screening them i apparently they see if they have obvious signs like if they're
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:06.760]  vomiting but then the cdc official i think it was a cdc official he's having something along
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:11.080]  lines of well we hope that it's not an issue because they'd probably be too sick to travel
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:17.480]  anyway if they had ebola well that's highly reassuring right so the whole issue here is it's
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:21.960]  now this phony debate it's this phony politically correct debate should we just let everyone in
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:26.040]  who may have a bowl should we just keep the borders open when is it going to be too late
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:31.160]  when is it going to be that there is a serious ebola crisis in the united states when is it
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:35.720]  going to be that thousands are affected if it comes to that if we don't have serious procedures
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:40.680]  to where we say okay fine now we can actually do something and i see this debate time and time again
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:47.080]  whether it's with gun control open borders ebola anything is this worthless worthless debate do
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:52.840]  you not find that over and over again exactly and now you know that jesse jackson is heading down to
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:59.080]  visit the the ebola family the family of patient zero down there so there seems to be an effort to
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:06.040]  racialize this bizarrely as if it is if it could even be thought of in that context now jesse jackson
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:10.680]  uh we had the article up on info wars today is heading down to that region because the the family
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:17.000]  feel they're being discriminated against so as this get links to the border obviously with isis
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:22.840]  many concerns over that with the the joe bigstone the james o' keith stun as people link this to
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:27.160]  the border rightly because threats could be pouring in because it can't be about logic though it has
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:31.960]  to be about race because that's that's interesting they they put it as if it's like select it's like
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:37.720]  tmz now it's not hey these people have a bola on average in liberia we should screen them and maybe
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:43.160]  talk about banning some travel or have some type of protocol i mean you were telling me in china
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:46.680]  when there was a sars outbreak what did they do they went through with the thermometer and checked
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:50.840]  everyone in hazmat suits they got on the plane before we were even allowed to get off the plane
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:55.560]  there were teams in hazmat suits that got on checked every individual passenger with the
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:13:00.920]  temperature gauge and no one was allowed to leave the plane until that procedure being completed
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:05.560]  and the complete opposite is the case here now we've got china wasn't criticized for being racist
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:12.600]  now obviously they're the paragon of freedom now but i mean you saw the cnn reporter earlier no
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:17.880]  questions asked whatsoever they were allowed straight through obama's promise to step up the
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:22.440]  that he's going to use the customs and border people at the airports to carry out these temperature
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:28.040]  checks again are they properly trained to spot these signs well let's talk about what is actually
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:33.000]  going on here because there's a few conclusions i'd like to talk about and all of them are scary to
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:39.320]  a degree but i think the activity by this administration by the cdc overall is only fueling
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:44.840]  the so-called conspiracy culture with reason i mean what do you expect people to think there's
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:51.240]  a few options either the cdc and the officials at large right now are so stupid and lazy that they
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:55.800]  just aren't doing anything that they just figure oh whatever it'll be fine i think that's highly
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:14:01.960]  unlikely the second one is that they're so decadent and absorbed in other things and so corrupt
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:07.080]  that the system and the bureaucracy is so scattered and locked down and sludge down that they can't
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:12.120]  actually do anything which i think is you know to a degree possible but then there's the third
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:20.680]  option in which they are for whatever reason not doing something with intent so there's wide ranges
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:26.200]  here within this scope to talk about and there's from extreme fringe conspiracy people that you
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:31.160]  know obviously it's here to wipe out all of x amount race or something like that to the more
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:36.680]  conservative viewpoint that these people are oftentimes corrupt and they've allocated resources
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:43.080]  to other things or they simply are incompetent which you know who knows the case but the reality
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:48.200]  is there's no good conclusion there's no conclusion that oh well a bull is not that bad so they obviously
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:52.920]  are highly intelligent smarter than us and they're keeping the borders open so isis can come in and
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:56.520]  shake our hands and there's no real threat despite the fact they keep raising the terror
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:00.760]  alert and freaking everyone out while keeping the borders open or oh a bull is fine except for the
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:05.240]  fact that the cdc director says he wants everyone to be scared and that is a major crisis and top
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:10.280]  scientists are saying it could be a pandemic so what is it you know that's the whole thing
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:15.480]  we've reached these conclusions time and time again and they're all bad there's no good answer
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:20.200]  the mainstream media acts like it's a debate a debate should we be concerned should we close
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:25.560]  off travel there is no debate the answer is obvious i mean i could entertain the fact that the
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:30.040]  initial case the patient zero was a case of incompetence that they sent him home even though
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:35.080]  they had the training of course even if we entertain that i mean is it incompetent though to
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:41.400]  send his stepdaughter the nursing assistant back to work after she was exposed to the to the virus
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:47.000]  seven days after coming into contact with it that the cdc told her she can go back to work in a
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.200]  hospital i mean that goes beyond incompetence but why are we surprised there was a patient zero to
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:58.440]  begin with if tens of thousands of people are getting Ebola and we don't have any bands on travel
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:02.600]  and no real pre screening and then they also by the way oh they'll tell you there's free screening
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:07.160]  we see if people are vomiting and and if they're showing obvious signs of Ebola we'll do something
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:11.960]  about it but then the next day they criticize and say well Africa has no real health care systems
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:16.200]  that's why Ebola is so bad because they can't pre-screen properly here it won't happen because
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:20.840]  we can pre-screen and we can isolate and then they rely on the next day they're pre-screening
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:26.440]  don't worry guys they're pre-screening travel so it's a total facade and then we wonder why
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:29.480]  there's a patient with Ebola in the United States there's going to be more there's no question
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:33.000]  they're going to fly over here because it's incubation period of what 21 days they're going
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  to fly over here and there's going to be multiple Ebola cases unless they shut something down
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.320]  but that's probably not going to happen until more outrage happens that's why the media it's so
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:47.000]  funny it's a debate there's no debate but it's we should not be surprised when there's patient 500
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  we should not be surprised because they're not doing anything about it I mean again it goes back
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:57.640]  we're told that people can only infect other people if they have the symptoms if they're
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:02.600]  showing symptoms yet we have an article that was published in the Lancet from 14 years ago which said
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:07.960]  that people even without Ebola symptoms who have contracted the virus can infect others
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:13.480]  so everything that we're being told by the CDC now is being disproven by studies that occurred
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:18.440]  as much as 14 years ago they don't even really know they don't even care they're but they they
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:23.640]  care enough to remove information from official websites like the public health agency of Canada
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:28.280]  who said it was probably airborne it was strongly suspected it had gone airborne they
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:33.320]  removed the information so it's about controlling information not controlling the disease and that's
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:38.360]  a big threat I've read the interviews with top medical experts where they say the sweat on your
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:45.080]  hand is enough to transfer it and just going on holding on to a railing or something that sweat
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:48.680]  can sit there for a long period of time the virus can stay alive for very long periods of time
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:53.640]  depending on the weather depending on numerous things so it is a real issue there's no question
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:58.520]  you know it's not like it's something like the flu which could spread much more quickly but
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:01.880]  is much less deadly but that's the whole issue is that Ebola is more deadly but many of us know
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:07.640]  this but I think the question really is should we be surprised about this the lack of outrage
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:13.960]  against the CDC when we're in a society where many people worship celebrities who cannot pass an
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:19.160]  elementary school spelling bee I mean is that the issue is it just that people don't care enough
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:22.680]  is that really what it is they don't know the actual science they don't know what's going on
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:27.240]  and I also want to talk about the fact that no one's warning people I mean we could talk about
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:30.840]  when we come back a little we'll get into a little bit right now no one's warning people about how
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:37.160]  they can prepare themselves no one's talking about the research as far back as 2009 on plant
[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:42.360]  compounds inhibiting the growth of Ebola and I'm not saying that these plant compounds are the
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.360]  answer they're going to save your life no I'm saying we're spending all this money waiting
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:50.840]  for Bill Gates to give us some magical vaccine when they're not really even looking into what
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:54.920]  that's going to do and you sure they're going to go test it on African kids and most of them are
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:19:00.200]  going to die if not all of them we're not worried about how to protect ourselves we're saying please
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:05.960]  Bill Gates go and develop us a vaccine to test on African babies while we sit here cowering and
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:11.000]  fear while the CDC does nothing doesn't even issue travel bans we're not looking and saying hey
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:16.120]  there is a plant compound called Genestine right and has not only does have 150 health
[02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:21.240]  benefits on record from PubMed studies across 50 map physiological pathways this is from green
[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:26.840]  men info but they found through the archives of virology from the UT medical branch right around
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:33.480]  here down the corner that the plant compound when compiled with this drug it actually had
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:40.120]  through treating animals the inhibitor it led to a significant increase in survival
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:46.120]  and other signs of this disease so it was inhibiting it to a degree and it's not completely
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:51.080]  conquering it but these plant compounds are doing amazing things against the Ebola virus but no one's
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:55.000]  funding that no one's talking about that no one's talking about iodine no one's talking about any
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:58.840]  of this they're just letting you sit there and saying we'll help you but we're actually not
[02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:02.120]  going to do anything we'll be back after the break stay tuned the benefits are trying to ban

[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:11.320]  all right
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.880]  back on the alex joneshow anthony gucciotti in studio we're talking about the vola we're talking
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:35.640]  about the public relations campaign behind the situation which is kind of gaining more traction
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:41.560]  more attention than the disease itself now and i mean the question we're going to ask is when are
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:46.280]  people going to draw a line in the sand when are they going to bang on the doors of the cdc when are
[02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:51.400]  they going to freak out about this i mean anthony in a moment is going to talk about what he saw
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:57.160]  during hurricane sandy where of course you know a huge amount of population there in new york was
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:02.280]  basically crippled they were cut off from all their electronic devices they couldn't charge
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:07.640]  their iPhones god forbid and people were dumpster diving people were freaking out as a result of
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:14.440]  that situation what would it take for this Ebola crisis to generate that same level of hysteria
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:22.200]  at anthony well you know i was in the heart of hurricane sandy and honestly it it was large hurricane
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:27.320]  but it was not that bad and i was in philadelphia at the time i had actually planned a trip to new
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:31.720]  york and i went to new york afterwards when there was taxis being pushed down the road due to the
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:37.320]  floods and there was like rats in the street it was it was pretty disgusting scenario but it was
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:42.760]  by no means apocalyptic in philadelphia where it wasn't even that bad there were people at the
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:47.160]  door of a cbs which is a drugstore banging on the door there were signs on the door saying sorry
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:51.160]  we're closed you know due to hurricane sandy we're out of water and stuff like that there are people
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:56.680]  freaking out they were just totally freaking out in a weird state of frenzy and i have taken
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:01.800]  some pictures and everything there was no water in some of the shelves imagine what will happen
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:06.280]  when people there's already hysteria i've been to dallas since this has happened there's already
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:11.640]  people freaking out about it saying oh my god i think my uncle has Ebola he has a fever you know
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:19.880]  freaking out imagine when if the cdc continues to be whatever they are impotent then another
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:24.920]  patient pops up in california another patient pops up in florida five patients pop up in new york
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:29.640]  four patients pop up in texas again over and over again people are going to go into a frenzy
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:33.000]  and whether or not it's warranted it doesn't matter they're going to do it they're going to
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  start stockpiling they're going to start freaking out and unfortunately they're not even going to
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:42.200]  know how to really prepare themselves because the cdc isn't telling them about genestine
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:45.240]  they're not telling them about iodine they're not telling them about storeable foods they're not
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:49.480]  telling them about water filtration devices that's just the biggest way to protect yourselves
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:52.520]  they're not talking about any of that they're telling them nothing so they're going to go to the
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:56.040]  grocery store they're going to freak out they're going to go to their doctor and ask for antibiotics
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:00.520]  which is for they're going to create antibiotic resistant bacterias which by the way can be
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:06.120]  conquered research shows with garlic which is the biggest new thing on the horizon garlic is going
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:11.800]  to be the answer once antibiotics are completely worthless and garlic extracts but anyway the
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:16.840]  problem comes when the cdc continues to do nothing and people freak out and they're going to be
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:21.320]  forced to do something and it's not going to be good that's where you talk into isolation that's
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.760]  where you talk into sending troops on the street because not even because it's full martial law
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:32.360]  just because people are going to literally demand that because nothing has been done and when 50
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:36.200]  people have a bull in the united states they're going to freak out if it comes to that although
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:40.920]  i mean in africa we've seen quite a laxadaisical response from the population there obviously
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:45.320]  it's ravaged several countries in africa well they think that the united states is coming in
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:49.880]  just to harvest their organs and that a bull isn't real and that if they don't like worship their
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:54.120]  witch doctors or whatever then they're going to get a bull i mean it's the totally crazy system over
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:28:00.520]  there here it's almost like we're almost as uneducated on the subject as well though thinking
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:06.760]  that basically if the god of cdc doesn't do something we're all going to die which in many
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:12.840]  ways if the cdc doesn't do something it's an issue but we're almost as uneducated in many ways
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:17.400]  i mean if they do go ahead with these mass quarantines once they've obviously botched the
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:21.640]  reaction the initial containment of the virus which it now appears they're doing everything
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:26.600]  in their power to achieve you know how many million gun owners in america are going to how
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:30.680]  are they going to respond to people coming door to door to try and quarantine their families it's
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:34.680]  going to be a serious issue because also you have to understand not everyone's locked into the news
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:38.200]  not everyone even knows what's going on there's people in east texas when you knock on their door
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:42.440]  they're just going to start shooting i mean that's the whole issue that's why it's so important to
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:45.720]  understand why they're not doing anything right now when you were talking about we should put a
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:49.000]  poll up and we should take calls i'm not going to be in the next segment you're going to be on with
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:54.520]  david night should take calls we should put a poll up on info wars dot com put it up shortly after
[02:28:54.520 --> 02:29:03.000]  this asking what is the motivation are they just lazy stupid impotent are they doing this on purpose
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:08.600]  do they really think this Ebola issue is a non threat what do they think and i'd be interested
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:14.120]  to see what the informed public has to say because i'm pretty sure they're not just lazy and i'm not
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:20.200]  also saying at the same time it is a crazy fringe conspiracy what it is i think is corruption and it
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:25.160]  is definitely by choice that they're doing this okay we're going to try and get that poll up on
[02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:31.640]  info wars dot com is this merely incompetence is it some kind of uh facet to bring obama to bear
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:37.160]  as the the king make right before the midterm elections is he going to be invested with even
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:42.200]  more power we'll be back on the alex joneshow we're going to talk to david night in studio

[02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:13.240]  of giants above the creeping fog of disinformation that clouds the american union this is one of
[02:33:13.240 --> 02:33:20.360]  the wisps and this is the last light radio your last beacon of truth and defiance i've always started
[02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:26.120]  my shows by saying that all ships lost in the night search for the lighthouse on the rock of the
[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:32.760]  enlightened but good truth seekers out there the battery is fading and the light is dying i see
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:38.600]  that freedom has failed us and with no light the night's gonna be a long one when he got three
[02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:46.440]  said this land is your land this land is my land great words but this land is their land now
[02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:58.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he it's alex jones
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:01.080]  on the gcn radio network
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:16.040]  back live on the alex jones show david nighting studio coming up what you heard there was
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:21.800]  steven king on shooter gennings his album black ribbons of course shooter gennings has been a
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:27.400]  previous guest he played a dj whose radio station was being shut down by the government as martial
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:33.160]  law was being declared the reason we play that is that steven king went on huff post live i believe
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:39.240]  yesterday gave some very interesting comments and we're going to roll that clip now go ahead it's
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:47.800]  tiring to look at and to say the world looks more and more like george orwell's vision in 1984
[02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:55.240]  where war is a constant thing um we went in uh to the mid east in my view in the wrong direction
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:35:02.520]  with george bush's adventures in iraq uh when the real problem and the basis for the brain down the
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:10.680]  the towers was in afghanistan but it's been since that happened uh that region has become
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:16.360]  destabilized i don't hold any brief for sunam hussein i think that he was a terrible man but there
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:21.640]  was a stability and checks and balances at that time that doesn't exist anymore there's a kind of
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:29.800]  anarchy and it's a little bit like a bump under the rug um we we dealt as well as we could with
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:36.760]  al-qaeda for years and now we've got iso and uh you know pretty soon it will be somebody else and
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:42.760]  it's impossible for us to put boots on the ground everywhere that we go we can't police the entire
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:49.240]  world so it's it's just a little bit depressing there's steven king on huff post live talking
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:55.240]  about permanent war for permanent peace and of course the characteristic of a banana republic
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:36:01.800]  is expansion abroad empirical expansion abroad while the police state grows at home they see
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:07.720]  steven king fears the world is starting to look like all wells 1984 we also got another clip which
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:14.360]  ties into this regarding the police state cash is now criminal possession of cash is being
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:20.600]  treated as a criminal offense in and of itself by some police departments here's a clip from john
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:26.840]  oliver public trust in the police is one of the most vital elements in a civilized society but for
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:32.600]  many americans that trust has been undermined by a procedure called civil forfeiture now i know it
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:39.000]  sounds like a gwyneth paltrow euphemism for divorce but but incredibly it's actually even worse than
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:46.520]  that civil asset forfeiture is really a mechanism by which the uh state and federal government can
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:53.480]  seize people's property without having to convict them of a crime most people can't afford to hire
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:58.760]  a lawyer to challenge it it's really legalized robbery by law enforcement and think about it that
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:04.520]  is a tough crime to report to the police give me a description of what the guy looked like well to
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:09.640]  be honest he looked a lot like the guy currently asking me what the guy looked like and if you think
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:15.000]  this sounds bad just wait until you see how it looks because the washington post recently published
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.120]  a major investigation featuring stories like that of this man who was driving from michigan to san
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:25.960]  francisco with 2400 dollars in cash that his dad had lent him to start a new job when he was pulled
[02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:32.360]  over in nevada i gave him my life since registration and then as he was looking at that information
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:36.120]  he asked me how much money i was traveling with ali told him about the money his dad gave him
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:42.280]  which he kept in the trunk he told me to turn on my air vents on high and roll up my windows
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:48.040]  and get out of the car because he was gonna run a canine around it dove didn't find drugs but he
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:53.160]  did find the 2400 dollars he said no i'm gonna keep the money because i've concluded through my
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:59.640]  investigation here that you are traveling from michigan to california to purchase drugs wow i mean
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:05.400]  there is so much wrong there including the fact that any policeman who genuinely believes you
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:10.920]  need to travel from michigan to california to purchase drugs needs to be introduced to the
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:17.400]  concept of the university of wisconsin madison okay that's the clue and it's basically you know
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:22.760]  your property is guilty until proven innocent david night this is about the criminalization of
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:26.600]  merely possessing cash well i'm glad to say that mainstream media is starting to talk about this
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:30.920]  i remember back in the 90s when i was involved with the libertarian party we were screaming at the
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:38.200]  top of our lungs about civil asset forfeiture and the way that it was destroying the fabric of our
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:43.400]  society law enforcement the courts everything they can go in and charge an inanimate object with a
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:47.960]  crime and they've done it over and over again and this was really old news back in the 90s early 90s
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:51.720]  before the internet they would go in and they would you would see court cases where it was
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:56.120]  u.s government versus learjet serial numbers blah blah blah they confiscate why they confiscate
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:39:03.240]  that learjet because a guy who offered essentially a contract taxi service if you will had flown a
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:07.400]  couple of individuals out of the country into canada and then back they subsequently found
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:11.800]  that those individuals were involved in a drug deal they arrested them they charged them they
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:16.600]  never charged the guy who owned the plane they never asserted that he had any culpability in
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:21.560]  any of this any knowledge of what was going on yet they still would confiscate his plane i could
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:25.960]  tell you stories for a half hour about what was going on with this i'm glad they're finally paying
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:32.120]  attention to it but look at the situation with libor for example we've got a london banker a
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:39.000]  senior banker for a london bank pleading guilty to fixing the liborate is facing up to 10 years
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:44.520]  in jail now he hasn't been sentenced yet in other words that's the maximum he's going to get people
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:49.480]  who are found guilty of possessing a small amount of marijuana thanks to the reagan
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:54.440]  administration's mandatory minimums can get more than 10 years just for that but this is a guy
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:40:00.680]  and these are banks where they they say according to this rt article they fraudulently boosted
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:07.320]  their profits they say a senior banker has pled guilty to a conspiracy to defraud and manipulate
[02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:12.680]  the libor and they're saying that he colluded his bank and other banks colluded together this is a
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:17.800]  conspiracy this is a real conspiracy folks it really happens they're charging them with the
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:22.840]  crime of conspiracy they colluded with other banks to manipulate the overall rate a rate
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:27.720]  and these other banks are banks like the royal bank of scotland the dutch bank credit swiss and
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:34.040]  jp morgan and city group and of course we've seen other organizations like hsbc and bank of america
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:40.040]  when they were involved in money laundering for drug dealers nobody went to jail they got a fine
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:45.640]  that was a slap on the wrist compared to the amount of money that they had made so we see this
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:51.080]  difference in the way people are treated it's absolutely outrageous it destroys everything
[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:54.840]  that our legal system is based on that they could confiscate your property by the legal
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:59.400]  fiction that your property committed a crime even though you while you were operating your plane
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:04.280]  or had your cash did not commit a crime it's absolutely outrageous and going back to one
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:09.880]  of those cases there i mean i've got the quote of an officer who this was his justification for
[02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:17.480]  confiscating a driver's cash quote common people do not carry this much u.s currency so in the case
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:23.960]  that it was 2400 dollars which in today's world with the inflation is not a great deal of money
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:28.840]  especially if you're going on a long trip i mean i've been interrogated before for taking over
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:34.760]  2000 euros through an airport so it really is insane how they're treating just the carrying
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:39.640]  of cash and i guess i want to understand too that cash is probably not going to make it back to the
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:44.600]  police department it's going to go in the pocket of that corrupt cop most likely that's the another
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:49.320]  issue is that it corrupts law enforcement it doesn't just destroy our due process it corrupts
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:53.640]  law enforcement and that's what happens when we try to solve a problem that is essentially
[02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:59.160]  a medical problem a psychological problem a spiritual problem we try to solve it with this
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:04.440]  hammer called force you know that's the the using the government against it it failed with alcohol
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:09.000]  prohibition but at least they had the decency and the respect for the law to enact a constitutional
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.600]  amendment they didn't even bother with that for everything that they're doing that were on drugs
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:16.600]  they don't even have the authority that can give themselves the authority under the constitution to
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:22.600]  do it they're just using raw intimidating force and i mean it becomes endemic to a point where
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:27.240]  you know if the cops see other people doing this they see them stealing the cash pocketing it in
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:33.160]  some cases just like the tsa where they would steal your ipad steal numerous other valuable
[02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:38.440]  items it becomes kind of expected kind of embraced and accepted by the other employees that this is
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:44.520]  just how this is just the way it's done so you know it feeds off itself in a way david yeah it's
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:49.560]  absolutely disgusting and i hope that people are finally as i said it's good to see the mainstream
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:55.480]  media picking it up comedians joking about it even though it is kind of a black humor hopefully we
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:59.320]  will do something about as we talked about earlier in our last week when you and i were here in the
[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:05.080]  studio the incarceration rate that america has is just outrageous compared to every other country
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:10.440]  we put a much larger percentage of our population in jail than even uh repressive communist regimes
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:15.640]  have done in the past what's interesting about the fact that it is you know in a in a comedy piece
[02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:22.440]  is the fact that those comedy shows particularly comedy central they're only beaten now by fox news
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:27.240]  in terms of viewers all the top evening fox news shows get the most viewers obviously but now the
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:33.720]  likes of comedy central the daily show are beating cnn beating msnbc because at least they give you
[02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:38.440]  a little bit of truth in with all the satire whereas you're not going to get that with the big
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:42.760]  networks obviously but moving on david you wanted to mention this american journalist who caught a
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:48.280]  bowler yeah we're saying and again this goes back to the we talked about earlier the difference
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:53.320]  between the way it's treated politically and the way that it's treated medically and of course the
[02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:58.760]  political aspect has a political correctness aspect that we have this story on info wars.com
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:04.360]  neighbors of Ebola patients say that they feel discriminated against well the reality is is
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:11.320]  that if you look back at the apartment complex where this lady that mr. Duncan caught it from lived
[02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:17.800]  nine people are dead there both of her parents have Ebola her brother has already died of Ebola
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:25.080]  mr. Duncan has it so basically that apartment complex has essentially become a death sentence
[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:28.840]  for everybody over there and this is what they said they said we've been through this over and over
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:33.480]  again we tell people no matter how much you love the person it is the health authorities responsibility
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:39.240]  to pick up the sick people that's the message that we're not getting from the cdc from judge
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:44.280]  jinkens they're giving people just the opposite message they're cavalierly coming into these areas
[02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:49.640]  and and just talking about how there's zero risk and of course risk is not a binary thing it isn't
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:53.400]  like there's 100 chance you're going to get it or a zero percent chance you're going to get it
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:58.520]  it's an analog function there's a varying scale of risk as you all as we all know we've all been
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:04.680]  in situations where someone has been sick with a cold or virus and some people and that were in
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:10.200]  close proximity of them would get it others wouldn't but why would we take that that chance with it
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:15.320]  and of course this story comes out from abc news about a u.s. journalist who's just being brought
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:21.080]  back for treatment to the united states said that he got Ebola while cleaning an infected car
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:26.120]  so what does that tell us about this sloppy cleanup work where these guys were pressure
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:33.000]  washing with no protective equipment air turning whatever was on the sidewalk into aerosol days
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:37.880]  afterwards but they just left it there for days by that time perhaps the virus was dead being
[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:43.880]  exposed to the light being exposed and left there from at least sunday until thursday afternoon
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:48.520]  when they did it that was there for a full lot four days but so it may have been dead by that
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:53.640]  point hopefully it was but during that time during that time when he threw up on sunday
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:59.560]  to the time that it died however long that was people who walked by there were exposed to that
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:04.440]  going to go so quick call now mike in pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead
[02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:10.600]  hi gentlemen i you guys are on the perfect topic if this is what i was calling to try to get out
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:18.520]  here if it's we're going to know very soon uh you know within 20 days here so if these uh practices
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:26.760]  that they're not doing okay and being very sloppy with really are you know the the true
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:31.160]  true Ebola virus because people are just going to start getting it everywhere with the way they've
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:36.840]  handled it i mean this is absolutely ridiculous number one they don't seem to be very concerned
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:44.200]  about it okay so i mean in a month from now if we don't have cases breaking out everywhere
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:49.480]  it's a given it was a false lie i mean because if nobody in the right mind would do these things
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:57.000]  under any normal situation well i mean the cdc again people are contradicting it on every level
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:01.480]  i mean i've got this article here u.s nurses say they are unprepared to handle Ebola patients
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:07.240]  these are the nurses working in the actual hospitals where any potential of Ebola victims will be
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:13.960]  taken and again the the hospital that took in patient zero Duncan last week they had all received
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:20.840]  Ebola training before he arrived and yet they sent him home anyway now we have hundreds of nurses
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:27.080]  last week i believe protesting against the fact that they had not received proper Ebola training
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:32.360]  we also have this article out of Reuters today there you see up on it for us dot com the shocking
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:39.320]  truth the u.s medical system is woefully unprepared for Ebola so david i mean the problem is if this
[02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:44.680]  does become more widespread we're not going to be ready to handle it clearly that's absolutely
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:49.400]  true paul and you know just as you were talking to robert david steel he made the comment that the
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:55.160]  cdc was not being honest with medical care workers he said and i didn't get the numbers that he had
[02:47:55.160 --> 02:48:00.600]  but basically what i bowled down to was that the particular size of the Ebola virus is smaller than
[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:05.160]  the filters that they're recommending for the health care workers that kind of echoes what
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:10.360]  we're hearing out of spain where we now have four people including one nurse hospitalized
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:14.360]  they're looking at them for Ebola it has definitely been confirmed on one of the health care workers
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:19.720]  and of course we've had over 300 health care workers die in west africa treating people
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:24.760]  they're very upset the union there is saying that they are accusing the government of providing
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:29.720]  hospital staff with inadequate protective clothing and according to the guardian they say staff at
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:35.000]  the hospital said waste from the rooms of both patients had been carried out in the same elevator
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:40.840]  used by all personnel the hospital is also reportedly not evacuated when the second patient
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:46.600]  came in to receive treatment so they're getting under a lot of pressure to explain their approach
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:52.520]  to this and there's going to be a lot of people very angry if this expands here in the united
[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:57.560]  states and of course we've had a top doctor say on fox news that he would not be surprised if the
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:03.480]  u.s. has another Ebola case so once this happens people are going to start asking some really
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:09.880]  hard questions of these health care officials who are offering casually dismissing the risks
[02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:16.360]  involved in this now we have reports 50 to 75 percent chance of Ebola hitting the uk i mean
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:20.680]  the question is we've had months to prepare for this and it seems that people have been caught
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:25.960]  on the back foot in in spain in the united states and potentially other countries going forward
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:31.560]  mike mike's gone we got evan in minnesota you're on the air go ahead evan yes how are you guys
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:40.280]  doing today good evan what's your point okay the cdc is there a private organization just like the
[02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:47.880]  federal reserve the cdc the question the cdc is just like the federal reserve it's a private
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:58.200]  organization why does the cdc own 70 patents of Ebola that means 70 variations along with the
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:03.880]  world's health or or not the world's health organization the national health organizations
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:14.120]  has the patent to make a um with bill gates a vaccine just like monsanto this is the question
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:20.040]  that came up david um weeks ago now because because the fda blocked several Ebola treatments
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  before this outbreak even began and then we've got reports that the cdc has all these
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:30.360]  patents on different strains of Ebola so is is the profit motive there in creating the panic
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:34.840]  then creating the vaccine with these patents we'll get your answer after the break going to go to
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:41.640]  more of your calls we've got james in florida sue in tennessee coming up and casey in oklahoma

[02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:36.920]  tomorrow but now the cfr a senior fellow at the cfr has found the cure for Ebola and it's obama care
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:40.760]  david night yeah this is pretty amazing and this kind of goes along with the press conference
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:45.480]  that kitt daniels wrote the story about uh they had a press conference today saying don't worry
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:50.440]  we're going to send these soldiers who really it's i have a question as to what their mission is
[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:55.000]  military men have a question as to what their mission is end harm's way in direct contact with
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:59.480]  Ebola but don't worry because they're going to have careful reintegration once they return to the
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:03.720]  us presumably the same way that they're reintegrating this nurse that they told she could go back to
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:08.040]  work as a healthcare worker after seven days after she was exposed to this Ebola patient
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:13.880]  but we see that this is a full offensive there's an article in stars and stripes and this was from
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:19.240]  lori garrett she is a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and the headlines
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:26.600]  says obama care may hold the key to saving the us from Ebola now don't worry soldiers if you go to
[02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:33.320]  africa and you get Ebola obama care and the va have your back that's essentially the bottom line here
[02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:37.720]  she pushes back against the what she calls false claims that the virus has spread through the
[02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:42.200]  air between monkeys house and military facility in the 90s we talked about that earlier we had
[02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:47.080]  quotes from the scientists who are actually there but she apparently believes otherwise
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:51.480]  and then she talks about how in hong kong when they forced quarantine they still got it the question
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:56.600]  is not whether it was 100 effective but whether it lowered the spread of the disease but this is
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:56:01.160]  the key takeaway article this is how she finishes it she says america's special vulnerability to
[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:08.360]  ebola is its limitations on access to healthcare so in times of contagion societal risk rises with
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:12.840]  every uninsured or underinsured individual who struggles to work or go off to school the fever
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:19.000]  avoiding bankrupting visits to health providers one doesn't have to have a political position up
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.880]  or down on obama care to recognize that it can solve this problem so we have infinite resources
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:29.320]  where we can take care of everyone in america and everyone in the world if they just come here
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:34.760]  obama care will save them but i mean they couldn't even take care of one ebola patient they sent
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:40.120]  him home they were trained for ebola yet it completely failed them and again nurses everywhere
[02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:46.040]  protesting that these hospitals are not prepared for admitting people potentially exposed to ebola
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:51.400]  so god knows how obama care is going to help the situation where what is it 40 percent of the people
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:56.840]  who've got this virus have died so in tennessee quick final call you're on the air go ahead
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:03.480]  my call reason i'm calling today is i've not heard any questions or anything brought up
[02:57:03.480 --> 02:57:10.920]  up one of your callers just called in and he never got an answer uh looking at the article the
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:17.720]  government of the u.s as represented by the department of health and human service center
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:27.240]  disease control the patent says the invention provides the isolated human ebola viruses denoted
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:35.960]  as ebola bun be fostered with the centered disease control in atlanta georgia in 2007
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:43.400]  there's a patent online and everybody's ignoring it i've sent it and sent it i've sent it to every
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:49.640]  news station and i'm not even heard antho wars mentioned it what they will tell you is that
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:54.520]  their patent is on the handling of it and the growing of it and that sort of thing but i'm
[02:57:54.520 --> 02:58:00.760]  very troubled by the fact that we have the cdc an organization like the federal reserve in so much
[02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:06.360]  control of what's happening here and i'm not very happy with the misinformation that has been coming
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:11.880]  out of there and the examples that they've been giving to people i firmly believe that they're
[02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:15.960]  going to allow this to grow they're looking at the bill millen the gates foundation and boroughs
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:20.280]  welcome are working on changing z-map so they can it's going to take them longer to do it but
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:25.720]  they're going to mass produce it in a different way after i think it has started to spread amongst
[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:30.680]  our soldiers and in the united states that's going to wrap it up for today's edition of the
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:35.320]  alex joneshow alex will be back in the hot seat tomorrow keep up to date with the latest news at
