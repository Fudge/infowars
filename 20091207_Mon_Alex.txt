[00:00.000 --> 00:11.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.040 --> 00:18.600]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.600 --> 00:35.280]  Texas Alex Jones it has begun the Copenhagen United Nations meeting taking
[00:35.280 --> 00:40.400]  place in Copenhagen Denmark United Nations climate change conference notice
[00:40.400 --> 00:45.640]  it's no longer global warming conference it's if the weather changes you need to
[00:45.640 --> 00:51.640]  pay a tax and have home inspectors in your home and only have one child because
[00:51.640 --> 00:55.800]  weather changing has never happened before the entire planet was a
[00:55.800 --> 01:06.680]  continual 76 degrees 365 days out of the year for millennia upon millennia upon
[01:06.680 --> 01:13.320]  millennia the oceans were always at the same level there were always the same
[01:13.320 --> 01:21.160]  number of continents Pangea never existed volcanoes don't put out carbon
[01:21.160 --> 01:25.320]  dioxide even though they do carbon dioxide that plants breathe and then
[01:25.320 --> 01:32.400]  exhale give off oxygen that humans breathe that is a conspiracy theory
[01:32.400 --> 01:40.760]  carbon dioxide is deadly it has begun the open takeover by world government a
[01:40.760 --> 01:47.120]  declaration of tyranny against free humanity a public declaration of world
[01:47.120 --> 01:55.320]  government is now upon us war has been declared upon the people of the planet
[01:55.320 --> 02:03.080]  and I will detail this after the break EPA sets carbon crackdown that's out of
[02:03.080 --> 02:11.520]  the New York Times a carbon crackdown on carbon dioxide methane and scores of
[02:11.520 --> 02:22.840]  other so-called global warming greenhouse gas causing gases they are
[02:22.840 --> 02:31.360]  finalizing in the next week in line with the Copenhagen Global Directorate to
[02:31.360 --> 02:39.320]  list carbon dioxide as a dangerous toxic waste EPA ABC News headline
[02:39.320 --> 02:45.760]  greenhouse gases in danger human health including carbon dioxide ladies and
[02:45.760 --> 02:50.000]  gentlemen this is the equivalent of listing water as a poison oxygen as a
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.920]  poison mother's milk as a poison this is absolutely outrageous but it's what the
[02:57.920 --> 03:04.640]  dumbed-down decadent public deserves if they don't wake up and say no Russia
[03:04.640 --> 03:08.880]  today did a devastatingly powerful interview with Lord Monkton the best
[03:08.880 --> 03:14.240]  I've ever seen him with precision laying everything out I'm gonna air this
[03:14.240 --> 03:19.520]  coming up in the next segment and he points out what I point out this is a
[03:19.520 --> 03:24.840]  famous anti-russian a famous anti-communist the biggest anti-communist in
[03:24.840 --> 03:28.880]  England he's listed by many publications as being the biggest anti-communist
[03:28.880 --> 03:36.320]  openly saying that Russia is 20 times freer than England and it is England has
[03:36.320 --> 03:41.720]  some of the most hardcore police state systems in the world by any measure so
[03:41.720 --> 03:47.640]  does the United States now that's pretty sick because Russia is not that free
[03:47.640 --> 03:51.920]  ladies and gentlemen there's big problems with Ned Yedyev and with
[03:51.920 --> 03:57.600]  the pootie and everybody else over there but that's how far we've fallen that a
[03:57.600 --> 04:03.520]  hardcore anti-russian I mean he's been anti Russia forever is saying Russia is
[04:03.520 --> 04:08.600]  more free but it's the truth and the truth is the truth is the truth is the
[04:08.600 --> 04:14.800]  truth is the truth and that's why the New World Order last 888 launched sneak
[04:14.800 --> 04:19.200]  attacks on Russia last year trying to get World War three started because they
[04:19.200 --> 04:22.840]  can't stand it that the New World Order doesn't completely control Russia and
[04:22.840 --> 04:29.000]  that Russia is threatening to torpedo the Copenhagen event and I'm sorry to
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.960]  tell you Russia and China are our best hopes and saying no to this but China
[04:34.960 --> 04:37.840]  has been bought off in his communist so they're gonna probably go ahead and go
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.760]  with it show is India completely corrupt and sniveling a lot of great
[04:42.760 --> 04:46.920]  people over there completely enslaved by the system it's free humanity against
[04:46.920 --> 04:53.280]  the globalist but yes what your baby exhales what you exhale five and a half
[04:53.280 --> 04:59.920]  pounds of a day on average now being listed as a deadly toxic chemical
[04:59.920 --> 05:04.920]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[05:04.920 --> 05:09.520]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[05:09.520 --> 05:13.440]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[05:13.440 --> 05:18.080]  turned menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[05:18.080 --> 05:22.720]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[05:22.720 --> 05:27.080]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[05:27.080 --> 05:32.360]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[05:32.360 --> 05:36.680]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[05:36.680 --> 05:40.160]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[05:40.160 --> 05:45.400]  check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[05:45.400 --> 05:51.080]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD
[05:51.080 --> 05:56.280]  at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[05:56.280 --> 06:03.080]  prison planet dot TV hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions if
[06:03.080 --> 06:06.960]  you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm how much

[07:00.120 --> 07:03.640]  want to tell you about the a cola blue atmospheric water generator that produces
[07:03.640 --> 07:06.640]  pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air no this isn't
[07:06.640 --> 07:10.000]  science fiction it's very real I know because I use one every day in my own

[07:52.680 --> 08:02.960]  cola blue on the web at www.ECOLOVLUE.com today ease the t-rex of political
[08:02.960 --> 08:08.600]  talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:08.600 --> 08:28.120]  if you were a eugenicist that wanted to set up a planetary regime to carry out
[08:28.120 --> 08:36.080]  forced Planned Parenthood style eugenics euthanasia of the old sterilization of
[08:36.080 --> 08:40.320]  the general population one child policies for people who can even get the
[08:40.320 --> 08:46.600]  license how would you do it you would shut off the resources you would declare
[08:46.600 --> 08:53.800]  the gas that all animals from chickens to cockroaches from blue whales dolphins
[08:53.800 --> 09:06.240]  polar bears of Bengal tigers lions grizzly bears fire ants caterpillars all animal
[09:06.240 --> 09:16.360]  life down to bacteria exhale give off carbon dioxide that is the life cycle
[09:16.360 --> 09:20.760]  now I know the listeners the regular listeners of this show know that you
[09:20.760 --> 09:24.640]  didn't need me to tell you that but the general public does not understand this
[09:24.640 --> 09:31.600]  and many times we've made the point and we've even played the famous pen and
[09:31.600 --> 09:34.280]  teller piece where they went out and did it but the Australian television has
[09:34.280 --> 09:38.360]  done it as well we've done it it's coming up in an upcoming film you'll
[09:38.360 --> 09:42.960]  walk out to the public with a fake petition saying yes dihydrogen monoxide
[09:42.960 --> 09:52.040]  it's horrible it can cause bloating it can cause urination we need to ban it
[09:52.040 --> 09:57.080]  it's being released by factories will you please sign the petition to ban it
[09:57.080 --> 10:03.640]  and 90 plus percent of people will sign the petition if you go to an
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.560]  environmental outdoor park meeting 99% in fact we never found someone who
[10:09.560 --> 10:15.080]  wouldn't sign it at one of the events neither the pen and teller everyone said
[10:15.080 --> 10:20.920]  they would ban dihydrogen monoxide dihydrogen monoxide may sound scary but
[10:20.920 --> 10:28.400]  it is H2O it is water similarly if you give someone the scientific name for
[10:28.400 --> 10:33.960]  salt sodium chloride 90 plus percent will say ban it I've done it in the
[10:33.960 --> 10:39.480]  airports I've done it on trains I've done it the street anytime I'm arguing with
[10:39.480 --> 10:42.480]  a fake environmentalist really a eugenicist cult member that doesn't
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.920]  understand what they're part of talk about mind control they're Nazis and
[10:46.920 --> 10:51.200]  don't even know it and I'll say should we ban dihydrogen monoxide should we
[10:51.200 --> 10:58.960]  ban sodium chloride they will say yes yes yes well ladies and gentlemen they
[10:58.960 --> 11:06.360]  are now banning carbon dioxide attacks on breathing New York Times EPA sets
[11:06.360 --> 11:13.080]  carbon crackdown greenhouse gases in danger human health they call it a
[11:13.080 --> 11:16.760]  form of toxic pollution Obama administration will formally declare
[11:16.760 --> 11:23.200]  danger of carbon dioxide at the Copenhagen event the United Nations
[11:23.200 --> 11:27.480]  climate change conference December 7th December 18th where they will attempt to
[11:27.480 --> 11:37.480]  ratify the treaty and in the treaty is total UN control over every nation on
[11:37.480 --> 11:42.240]  earth and once you sign on to it you cannot get out of it unless there is a
[11:42.240 --> 11:53.080]  unanimous 191 country signatory vote to let you out absolute total end of
[11:53.080 --> 11:56.520]  America we've already got world government but now it's setting up an
[11:56.520 --> 12:08.560]  ironclad dictatorship we have more United Nations documents powerful article
[12:08.560 --> 12:14.720]  written at info wars.com with links directly to the United Nations own
[12:14.720 --> 12:21.120]  website where one of the directors of the climate change conference openly has
[12:21.120 --> 12:26.200]  written letters saying we will create a global religion of the earth built
[12:26.200 --> 12:30.360]  around world government and that the entire elite of the planet have a
[12:30.360 --> 12:35.080]  consensus for population reduction and that the general public doesn't know
[12:35.080 --> 12:40.240]  this or understand it and that it's a good thing I'm gonna be covering that
[12:40.240 --> 12:48.040]  as well today one of hundreds of government documents admitting this not
[12:48.040 --> 12:51.640]  hundreds thousands I really think about it there are hundreds of documents
[12:51.640 --> 12:57.720]  sometimes 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 100 times per book per white paper calling for it
[12:57.720 --> 13:05.320]  so it's in the thousands this is just an absolute nightmare scenario that we are
[13:05.320 --> 13:10.320]  facing as a society I want to go ahead and go to break and come back with a
[13:10.320 --> 13:16.680]  few more minutes of Lord Moncton on Russia today because he lays it out so
[13:16.680 --> 13:22.440]  clearly Lord Moncton will be joining us tomorrow from Copenhagen Jesse Ventura
[13:22.440 --> 13:27.120]  is going to be joining us live tomorrow as well other huge guests coming up
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.760]  throughout the week but here is part of the interview we have you want to see
[13:31.760 --> 13:37.120]  the video it's up on info wars.com of the Russia today interview with Lord
[13:37.120 --> 13:46.600]  Moncton here it is on the eve of their Copenhagen summit on greenhouse
[13:46.600 --> 13:50.680]  gases I'm talking to Lord Christopher Moncton a renowned climate change
[13:50.680 --> 13:55.920]  skeptic he's attending Copenhagen to persuade delegates that the science is
[13:55.920 --> 14:00.040]  faulty Lord Moncton and thanks very much for talking to RT today first of all
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.840]  could you just explain your general stance on climate change the climate has
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.920]  always changed the climate is changing the climate will continue to change
[14:08.920 --> 14:14.320]  humankind does not have the power to do very much about it and we would be
[14:14.320 --> 14:18.320]  arrogant to assume that we can. What evidence do you have that climate change
[14:18.320 --> 14:23.840]  isn't man-made? The scientific question amounts to this are the greenhouse gases
[14:23.840 --> 14:30.520]  that we add to the atmosphere sufficient in quantity and in global warming
[14:30.520 --> 14:38.360]  potential to stop outgoing heat energy bouncing in from the sun hitting the
[14:38.360 --> 14:42.720]  earth and then going back out into space again are they strong enough to stop it
[14:42.720 --> 14:47.280]  going out into space so that it stays down here and causes a little bit of
[14:47.280 --> 14:52.440]  warming well we know that they cause a little bit of warming because the entire
[14:52.440 --> 14:58.240]  atmosphere keeps the planet around 18 or 20 Celsius warmer than it would be if we
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.400]  didn't have an atmosphere so the greenhouse effect of all the greenhouse
[15:02.400 --> 15:08.320]  gases now existing in the atmosphere is only 18 or 20 Celsius it's tiny so the
[15:08.320 --> 15:14.080]  idea that changing one two thousandth of the composition of the atmosphere from
[15:14.080 --> 15:19.200]  oxygen to carbon dioxide as we may do this century if we go on burning fossil
[15:19.200 --> 15:25.400]  fuels as much as we like will somehow cause a warming of anything up to six
[15:25.400 --> 15:30.600]  Celsius degrees or something like a third of the effect of the entire
[15:30.600 --> 15:36.600]  existing atmosphere is plainly nonsense. Do you think that climate change as it
[15:36.600 --> 15:42.480]  stands at the moment is a political fad? Of course it is these scares come and go
[15:42.480 --> 15:47.760]  you may remember the millennium bug you may remember swine flu which is another
[15:47.760 --> 15:50.760]  scare that's running at the moment virologist making a fortune out of
[15:50.760 --> 15:54.680]  saying it's all very terrible in fact the number of people killed by swine flu
[15:54.680 --> 15:59.040]  is smaller than the number of people killed by ordinary flu that's now blinding
[15:59.040 --> 16:03.240]  the obvious it always was blinding the obvious but the virologist got in there
[16:03.240 --> 16:07.000]  whipped up the scare made lots of money just as the climatologists have been
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.400]  very successfully doing for 20 years this is the biggest scientific scare
[16:10.400 --> 16:14.720]  that's ever got off the ground but now it has come to an end and it's come to a
[16:14.720 --> 16:21.200]  complete end because recently after 20 years of careful measurement using the
[16:21.200 --> 16:25.200]  earth radiation budget experiment satellite we have been able to determine
[16:25.200 --> 16:31.600]  that the amount of outgoing radiation escaping into space is almost as great as
[16:31.600 --> 16:35.800]  it always was the extra greenhouse gases were adding are making some difference
[16:35.800 --> 16:40.120]  but very very small so we might be looking over the whole of the next
[16:40.120 --> 16:45.560]  century at a global warming of at most one perhaps one and a half Celsius
[16:45.560 --> 16:50.320]  degrees more likely just half a Celsius degree something which is negligible and
[16:50.320 --> 16:54.680]  generally beneficial certainly nothing that requires any policy action
[16:54.680 --> 17:00.240]  whatsoever except to have the courage to do nothing and if what you say is true
[17:00.240 --> 17:05.760]  why would the climate change lobby and governments either exaggerate or totally
[17:05.760 --> 17:11.400]  invent the threat of global warming well we know that the class politic and the
[17:11.400 --> 17:16.960]  class scientific the the great and the good are conspiring together to make up
[17:16.960 --> 17:24.840]  the evidence because just weeks ago it was revealed that at the climate
[17:24.840 --> 17:29.640]  research center at the University of East Anglia and among scientists in league
[17:29.640 --> 17:35.480]  with that center right across the world data had been blatantly fabricated to
[17:35.480 --> 17:39.680]  produce the desired result of pretending there was a problem when there isn't one
[17:39.680 --> 17:46.320]  and so this news that data have been fabricated computer models have been
[17:46.320 --> 17:51.960]  tinkered with computer code has been tampered with things have simply been
[17:51.960 --> 17:56.840]  made up temperature records have been simply created out of nothing all of
[17:56.840 --> 18:01.080]  this news doesn't come as a surprise to me because the people who were named in
[18:01.080 --> 18:06.880]  those emails are people on whom I've had my eye for some time others I'm in
[18:06.880 --> 18:11.840]  contact with have been noting the political and financial connections
[18:11.840 --> 18:17.480]  between these scientists and politicians and so it's very clear that what has
[18:17.480 --> 18:22.880]  happened is yet another attempt by the governing class of the world if you like
[18:22.880 --> 18:29.080]  to take advantage of the little guy to conspire against the governed to have
[18:29.080 --> 18:35.280]  another excuse for exaggerated levels of taxation and of regulation and of
[18:35.280 --> 18:40.360]  interference isn't it a fact that the polar ice cap is melting a hundred years
[18:40.360 --> 18:44.400]  ago people used to skate on the Thames River just in the last few weeks we've
[18:44.400 --> 18:49.040]  had enormous floods in Cumbria aren't these all evidence that climate change
[18:49.040 --> 18:55.280]  is in fact happening you notice climate phenomena happening you say oh well we
[18:55.280 --> 18:59.880]  don't know why these climate phenomena are happening we don't even check whether
[18:59.880 --> 19:05.920]  they've happened before so we'll just say we'll invent a scare and we'll say
[19:05.920 --> 19:10.040]  that it's humankind that is causing these changes to happen and if I explain
[19:10.040 --> 19:15.080]  it that way you can see how absurd that entire line of argument is yes the
[19:15.080 --> 19:22.820]  North Polar ice cap lost 27% and that is exactly we're gonna back that up and
[19:22.820 --> 19:28.200]  come back because they can say oh look it got 27% smaller in the summer but it
[19:28.200 --> 19:32.880]  came back the next winter but see they play little statistical games and when
[19:32.880 --> 19:36.480]  you read the Club of Rome and you in documents from the 60s 70s 80s and 90s
[19:36.480 --> 19:42.200]  they talk about inventing they think you're so stupid they have public
[19:42.200 --> 19:47.080]  reports talking about how they just invented it to make you the enemy so
[19:47.080 --> 19:52.120]  they can cut your resources off and not let you have children they know it's a
[19:52.120 --> 19:57.720]  fraud do you understand that they know it's a fraud and the emails just prove
[19:57.720 --> 20:06.640]  that that much more this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill gun cells are
[20:06.640 --> 20:10.280]  on a staggering pace gun prices are going through the roof and that means
[20:10.280 --> 20:14.760]  desperate vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get
[20:14.760 --> 20:18.560]  them now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from

[24:02.600 --> 24:08.200]  okay let's go back to Lord Montyn
[24:08.360 --> 24:17.400]  the argument is yes the North Polar ice cap lost 27% of the ice that is normally
[24:17.400 --> 24:22.040]  there at the summer minimum in 2007 compared with that which we had known
[24:22.040 --> 24:27.440]  was normal from 30 years of satellite observations but it's grown back by 24%
[24:27.440 --> 24:32.960]  in the last two years so that shows the enormous volatility of the Arctic
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.560]  climate it's famous for it and the floods in Cumbria a thousand year event but
[24:37.560 --> 24:41.280]  you see if you take a hundred different micro climates which exist in Britain
[24:41.280 --> 24:45.280]  and there are 10 different climatic extreme events that could happen in each
[24:45.280 --> 24:49.400]  one you're going to get a thousand year event once a year these extreme weather
[24:49.400 --> 24:54.160]  events come around just as they always have in any chaotic object mathematically
[24:54.160 --> 24:58.600]  speaking you would expect this to happen it tells us nothing about whether the
[24:58.600 --> 25:05.000]  world is steadily warming yes it has been warming for 300 years during 280 of
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.640]  which we couldn't have had anything to do with it and the Antarctic ice cap is
[25:09.640 --> 25:16.400]  expanding the sea ice in the Antarctic reached a record extent in 2007 three
[25:16.400 --> 25:21.600]  weeks after the record minimum in the Arctic there was a record maximum in the
[25:21.600 --> 25:27.160]  Antarctic the IPCC has a huge body of seemingly solid scientific evidence
[25:27.160 --> 25:31.920]  behind it and they say that it's 90% likely that climate change is man-made
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.880]  how do you refute that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for saying
[25:37.880 --> 25:42.120]  there is a 90% probability that most of the warming of the last 50 years was
[25:42.120 --> 25:46.760]  caused by humankind none whatsoever you could go for instance to a paper by
[25:46.760 --> 25:51.720]  Scafetta and West just last year saying that 69% of all the warming of the last
[25:51.720 --> 25:56.480]  50 years was caused by the Sun I'm not entirely convinced by that argument
[25:56.480 --> 26:02.000]  either the fact is we have no means of knowing what are the influences that
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.600]  cause the climate to fluctuate in the short term upwards or downwards this is
[26:06.600 --> 26:11.280]  simply beyond our capacity to measure or analyze what we do know and this we can
[26:11.280 --> 26:15.400]  do by laboratory experiment and by a little bit of elementary mathematics is
[26:15.400 --> 26:20.040]  what the maximum possible effect of adding co2 to the atmosphere can be and
[26:20.040 --> 26:25.320]  the answer is it's very very very small even if climate change theory hasn't
[26:25.320 --> 26:29.640]  been entirely put to the test isn't it better to do something now rather than
[26:29.640 --> 26:34.280]  wait for flooding drought and temperature rises the precautions
[26:34.280 --> 26:40.040]  themselves let us say in the shape of replacing one-third of the world's
[26:40.040 --> 26:45.560]  agricultural land which grew grew food with growing biofuels instead so we
[26:45.560 --> 26:48.920]  were once growing food for people that needed it now we grow biofuels for
[26:48.920 --> 26:54.160]  clunkers that don't result a doubling of world food prices in just over a year
[26:54.160 --> 26:58.960]  three-quarters of which was attributed by the World Bank to this biofuel scam
[26:58.960 --> 27:03.800]  which comes out of the global warming scare result if we have to pay twice as
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.760]  much for our food it's inconvenient if you're in a poor country that difference
[27:08.760 --> 27:14.040]  of a hundred percent in the price of your food is the difference between life
[27:14.040 --> 27:20.560]  and death there have been major food riots in a dozen regions of the world
[27:20.560 --> 27:24.840]  hardly reported at all in the West because they're so busy reporting on
[27:24.840 --> 27:29.520]  every little icicle putatively dribbling in Greenland and those food
[27:29.520 --> 27:34.560]  riots are happening because people are dying by the million of starvation who
[27:34.560 --> 27:39.960]  would not have died at all had this climate scare not engendered this dash
[27:39.960 --> 27:44.360]  for biofuels what do you think will happen to the climate in say the next
[27:44.360 --> 27:49.280]  hundred years I asked the world's greatest expert on climate that and that
[27:49.280 --> 27:54.040]  is professor Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
[27:54.040 --> 27:59.200]  generally recognized with a man who knows more than anyone else in the
[27:59.200 --> 28:04.600]  world about how the atmosphere will behave and I said to him dick I said I've
[28:04.600 --> 28:09.920]  been asked to make a bet on whether it's going to be warmer or cooler in the
[28:09.920 --> 28:16.520]  next 50 years can you tell me he said yes I can it will be either warmer or the
[28:16.520 --> 28:21.520]  same as today or cooler and the chances that it'll be warmer are exactly the
[28:21.520 --> 28:26.720]  same as the chances that it will be cooler and you're going to the Copenhagen
[28:26.720 --> 28:31.320]  Summit on greenhouse gases what's your objective there my objective at
[28:31.320 --> 28:36.800]  Copenhagen will be to say to the leading delegations there in particular the
[28:36.800 --> 28:43.880]  Americans the Canadians the Japanese okay I'm gonna come back and play the
[28:43.880 --> 28:47.000]  last two minutes of the interview where he talks about what his objective in
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.520]  Copenhagen will be and what all of our objectives should be and I'm gonna give
[28:50.520 --> 28:57.200]  you the latest developments on climate gate we are also going to get into the
[28:57.200 --> 29:02.320]  treaty itself the establishment of world government and the biggest news now
[29:02.320 --> 29:06.640]  this is old news for our listeners but it's they're really doing it the EPA has
[29:06.640 --> 29:11.560]  announced this morning they will list by the end of the Copenhagen event
[29:11.560 --> 29:20.360]  December 18th it goes for 11 12 days they will announce carbon dioxide as a
[29:20.360 --> 29:28.760]  toxic waste this is unbelievable scientific fraud this is a fraud as big
[29:28.760 --> 29:37.080]  as saying the moon is made of cheddar cheese or of Swiss cheese it is just
[29:37.080 --> 29:44.440]  absolutely insanely ridiculous and shows how much contempt the globalist have
[29:44.440 --> 29:51.840]  of the general public this is unbelievable we're on the march the

[32:07.080 --> 32:11.240]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control
[32:11.240 --> 32:15.280]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[32:15.280 --> 32:19.160]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[32:19.160 --> 32:23.440]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[32:23.440 --> 32:27.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[32:27.600 --> 32:31.920]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[32:31.920 --> 32:35.640]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number

[33:11.080 --> 33:16.960]  all right let's finish up with Lord Moncton with what he's going to be doing
[33:16.960 --> 33:22.240]  at the Copenhagen event that started this morning started about eight hours
[33:22.240 --> 33:28.000]  ago in Denmark the world government openly being announced this is what he
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.360]  is planning to do he is scheduled to be joining us tomorrow for a full hour via
[33:34.360 --> 33:41.000]  cell phone from the conference that should be wild but here it is and you're
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.040]  going to the Copenhagen Summit on greenhouse gases what's your objective
[33:45.040 --> 33:51.560]  there my objective at Copenhagen will be to say to the leading delegations there
[33:51.560 --> 33:55.800]  in particular the Americans the Canadians the Japanese Australians the
[33:55.800 --> 33:58.960]  New Zealanders I shan't bother with Europe because that is decided by
[33:58.960 --> 34:03.200]  commissars whom we don't elect can't hold to account can't remove and can't
[34:03.200 --> 34:07.560]  persuade we are no longer a democracy in Western Europe but I'm going to be
[34:07.560 --> 34:10.480]  talking to the delegations of the democracies and I'm going to be saying
[34:10.480 --> 34:15.640]  to them one by one very quietly first of all here's the science it no longer
[34:15.640 --> 34:20.840]  adds up and everybody knows it no longer adds up and your voters now know it no
[34:20.840 --> 34:25.080]  longer adds up we're moving away from that now and we're moving towards a
[34:25.080 --> 34:30.160]  world in which once again the skepticism which is the proper approach of the
[34:30.160 --> 34:36.320]  scientist is becoming instinct in the ordinary voters mind we be talking to
[34:36.320 --> 34:42.840]  the Russians yes I will because although the present Russian leadership has had
[34:42.840 --> 34:50.920]  not always a very kindly press in Britain I will tell you this the Russian
[34:50.920 --> 35:00.000]  democracy is 20 times more democratic than the British democracy has become
[35:00.000 --> 35:07.960]  because we now have 90% of our laws made for us by commissars that is the
[35:07.960 --> 35:10.960]  official German word for the commissioners of the European Union whom we
[35:10.960 --> 35:16.840]  don't elect can't question can't remove and can't replace they make 90% of the
[35:16.840 --> 35:22.080]  laws of Britain but you have a do mark you have a parliament in Russia which
[35:22.080 --> 35:28.840]  makes a hundred percent of Russia's laws you are now a true democracy God bless
[35:28.840 --> 35:32.680]  you for it of course I'll be talking to your delegation because I'll be talking
[35:32.680 --> 35:37.720]  to the delegation of a democratic administration we no longer have one I
[35:37.720 --> 35:43.480]  shall not be bothering to talk to the British delegation all right ladies and
[35:43.480 --> 35:48.720]  gentlemen and that is the bottom line under the Lisbon Treaty and other
[35:48.720 --> 35:55.360]  treaties under EU expansion an unelected group of bureaucrats rule the 25 member
[35:55.360 --> 36:02.680]  nations of the EU including England who has never been allowed to have a vote
[36:02.720 --> 36:07.040]  Scotland and England have never been allowed to even have a vote on whether
[36:07.040 --> 36:11.120]  they want to be under its control they have just gone under its control laws
[36:11.120 --> 36:18.480]  against free speech environmental laws and taxes total control and when you
[36:18.480 --> 36:24.440]  read the Club of Rome documents when you read the statements that we cover in my
[36:24.440 --> 36:28.280]  film in game blueprint for global enslavement when you look at the SPP
[36:28.280 --> 36:32.720]  security prosperity partnership documents when you read the statements of the
[36:32.720 --> 36:37.000]  European Union when you read the public statements by the new head of the
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.440]  European Union Herman von Rumpu I was calling Herman von Rumpi it's von
[36:43.440 --> 36:47.520]  Rumpu is how it's actually pronounced utterly ridiculous sorry if your name
[36:47.520 --> 36:52.000]  happens to be wrong poohy just it's doesn't roll off the tongue too well they
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.240]  are saying that this will be a global Europe that the European Union is the
[36:56.240 --> 37:03.160]  center of the spoke the core that the big-moneyed Rothschild and and and other
[37:03.160 --> 37:09.160]  interest the Saxe-Coburg Guthers of England and of Europe they are the
[37:09.160 --> 37:13.080]  dominant force they loaned the money to JP Morgan when he died it came out in
[37:13.080 --> 37:16.840]  mainstream newspapers he was a British slash European agent they loaned the
[37:16.840 --> 37:24.400]  money to the Rockefellers they loaned all the money to set up the robber baron
[37:24.400 --> 37:28.760]  blue blood elite of the United States they had tried to take us over again in
[37:28.760 --> 37:35.080]  1776 they tried to finance the south in the 1830s to overthrow Jackson but
[37:35.080 --> 37:39.400]  because he was a southerner from South Carolina and then Tennessee he was able
[37:39.400 --> 37:43.480]  to beat it they then funded the south again trying to break up the United
[37:43.480 --> 37:47.400]  States and I'm not taking sides on the north and south my entire family was on
[37:47.400 --> 37:52.480]  the south and colonels and generals and they were being abused by the north so
[37:52.480 --> 37:56.200]  the British came in and manipulated that to try to break up the country but
[37:56.200 --> 38:02.880]  failed again this is imperial divide and conquer that we're dealing with and
[38:02.880 --> 38:08.400]  when you talk about the British they are a royal house out of Europe and you
[38:08.400 --> 38:15.400]  read in the Treaty of Rome 1957 that they planned a European Union that would
[38:15.400 --> 38:23.120]  then take over the planet and they discuss how Hitler did it wrong using
[38:23.120 --> 38:27.800]  force that needed to be done by stealth and we see that again and again in the
[38:27.800 --> 38:32.320]  latest documents that have been released via four year request and lawsuits in
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.760]  Canada the US England and the continent of Europe that it's all being done by
[38:36.760 --> 38:43.800]  stealth now in 1998 when George Bush was running for reelection as governor I went
[38:43.800 --> 38:46.920]  to a press conference even given the same speech over and over again they had
[38:46.920 --> 38:49.960]  said he would take questions then they announced he wouldn't take questions he
[38:49.960 --> 38:55.680]  gave the speech at the end of his speech because his speech was online when it was
[38:55.680 --> 38:59.480]  the end of the speech I asked the question I said if you care about Texas so
[38:59.480 --> 39:03.880]  much what about the CFR what about Europe taking over America through the
[39:03.880 --> 39:07.680]  private fellow reserve I knew it was that banking system getting everyone in
[39:07.680 --> 39:11.880]  debt getting the states in debt to implode us through derivatives as they
[39:11.880 --> 39:16.560]  done in third world countries over and over again then in March of 2002 over
[39:16.560 --> 39:20.400]  a thousand pages of secret IMF and World Bank documents got leaked to Greg
[39:20.400 --> 39:26.200]  Palace of BBC stating they were planning it in the next eight years in Europe in
[39:26.200 --> 39:32.920]  the US to bankrupt us just like Argentina to bankrupt us just like
[39:32.920 --> 39:38.160]  African countries and Asian countries Nigeria is one of the best examples we
[39:38.160 --> 39:43.600]  know their game plan that's how we're able to lay all this out again I use the
[39:43.600 --> 39:48.160]  parable of the TV guide if I come home and tell my wife at five o'clock when
[39:48.160 --> 39:53.360]  we're eating dinner on Monday night hey honey the Bengals are going to be
[39:53.360 --> 39:58.320]  playing the Cowboys tonight and then the Bengals and the Cowboys come on at
[39:58.320 --> 40:02.960]  seven eight o'clock at night for an NFL game she doesn't say my gosh honey you
[40:02.960 --> 40:09.080]  you've got psychic powers how did you know this no it's the TV guide they told
[40:09.080 --> 40:16.120]  us what they would do it's public it's public they're going to bankrupt
[40:16.120 --> 40:20.280]  everything they want you to riot they're then going to turn regular army and
[40:20.280 --> 40:24.800]  paramilitary troops loose on you to sell the idea that we have to have martial
[40:24.800 --> 40:29.240]  law they won't call it martial law they'll call it security crackdown
[40:29.240 --> 40:34.680]  they're going to take over everything this is a hot takeover they're getting
[40:34.680 --> 40:40.840]  ready for not a cold war against freedom war is being declared on humanity
[40:40.840 --> 40:46.000]  world government is here do I need to play Al Gore do I need to play Vaughn
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.560]  Roompi do I need to play Bankind Moon saying world government do I need to
[40:51.560 --> 40:58.720]  play the president Obama saying global governance do I need to play these
[40:58.720 --> 41:03.600]  clips again you've all heard them or if your neighbors or friends haven't get
[41:03.600 --> 41:08.800]  the film follow the Republic where they're on video saying it we need to
[41:08.800 --> 41:14.200]  warn people now we're being politically conquered this is a economic
[41:14.200 --> 41:19.560]  political corporate coup of every sovereign nation and these people are
[41:19.560 --> 41:24.520]  Nazi eugenicists and I use the term Nazi they're not really Nazis that's just
[41:24.520 --> 41:31.000]  one flavor of one spin-off group of these people Hitler learned everything he
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.280]  did from England in the US and this is a more liberal version of that where they
[41:36.280 --> 41:42.840]  say we're going to sterilize and kill everybody do you understand this is the
[41:42.840 --> 41:48.640]  only issue this is the issue this is everything happening now now here I am
[41:48.640 --> 41:56.200]  11 years ago having my arm almost twisted off my back they they grabbed it
[41:56.200 --> 42:01.120]  twisted it all the way up to the top of my back to this day my shoulder
[42:01.120 --> 42:05.360]  rockator cuff is ripped from this and I roll over at night wrong shooting
[42:05.360 --> 42:12.360]  pangos through me for simply asking a question and saying isn't it Europe
[42:12.360 --> 42:19.440]  that's taking us over and now what is happening this is the antichrist comparatively
[42:19.440 --> 42:22.840]  to our Declaration of Independence it is the opposite of that it is a
[42:22.840 --> 42:29.040]  declaration of tyranny over all resources and what humans exhale happening
[42:29.040 --> 42:36.080]  now and Obama is going to sign that stinking treaty you watch now here it
[42:36.080 --> 42:42.840]  is here is George Bush an endorsement of a philosophy I believe in my heart of
[42:42.840 --> 42:47.520]  hearts the victory in 1998 is going to be good for Texas and that's the most
[42:47.520 --> 42:51.600]  important thing about the campaign wouldn't sir certainly abolish the
[42:51.600 --> 42:55.600]  Federal Reserve and the CFR that's the real reality that none of you will talk
[42:55.600 --> 43:01.520]  about most of your members that's what's destroying this country governor don't
[43:01.520 --> 43:07.280]  you stand for America sir what about the Federal Reserve and CFR you people will
[43:07.280 --> 43:10.760]  be lied to this country's been taken over by Europe and I'm being drug up
[43:10.760 --> 43:22.920]  laugh at it all right ladies and gentlemen you can if you want to watch
[43:22.920 --> 43:27.280]  that video it's all over the web just Google Alex Jones gets arrested for
[43:27.280 --> 43:39.360]  asking George W. Bush a question again how did I know 11 years ago 11 years
[43:39.360 --> 43:44.160]  ago what the threat was the private banking dictatorship controlled by
[43:44.160 --> 43:52.000]  Europe because I read their own documents but now they're openly
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.120]  establishing the world dictatorship so they have to admit what they're doing
[43:56.120 --> 44:00.880]  but put a spin on it like they're doing it to help everyone if you will simply
[44:00.880 --> 44:06.280]  warn everyone you know this can be stopped and I want to tell the bureaucrats
[44:06.280 --> 44:12.360]  the enforcers the corporate minions the police something when you go along with
[44:12.360 --> 44:16.760]  this system when you violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution when you hunt
[44:16.760 --> 44:21.400]  the American people when you think of us as animals when you're conditioned by
[44:21.400 --> 44:26.280]  television and movies that beating us and tasering us is cute and funny when
[44:26.280 --> 44:30.600]  you are trained to snatch people's children with no due process when you
[44:30.600 --> 44:35.640]  are trained to forcibly inoculate the population you are siding with the
[44:35.640 --> 44:41.240]  greatest evil ever manifested on this planet I know most of you are good men
[44:41.240 --> 44:45.640]  and women that serve this system your compartmentalized and you need to
[44:45.640 --> 44:51.120]  understand the true cost of what we are facing as a society and as a planet
[44:51.120 --> 44:58.560]  you need to know and to be told and to be reminded that there is an important
[44:58.560 --> 45:07.880]  choice that you need to make everyone listening to my voice must call every
[45:07.880 --> 45:12.160]  talk show they can about the global government takeover you've got to call
[45:12.160 --> 45:16.800]  every talk show you can about what taxing carbon dioxide will do you've
[45:16.800 --> 45:20.600]  got to call everyone you know and you've got to call Congress and tell them do
[45:20.600 --> 45:27.080]  not ratify this treaty in the US Senate do not pass the government takeover of
[45:27.080 --> 45:30.520]  healthcare that gives these eugenicists control over our lives they want you
[45:30.520 --> 45:35.240]  dependent on them do not let them legalize all the illegals and open the
[45:35.240 --> 45:39.320]  borders up for the North American Union to further bankrupt the states that's
[45:39.320 --> 45:44.040]  starting now in Congress we have got to take our states back we've got to
[45:44.040 --> 45:48.760]  educate our legislatures we've got to have the states declare their ninth and
[45:48.760 --> 45:53.800]  tenth amendment just powers over the rogue federal government we have to just
[45:53.800 --> 45:58.320]  chant with one voice the government is criminal the government is illegal the
[45:58.320 --> 46:02.920]  government is been hijacked by foreign corporate interest we must get that word
[46:02.920 --> 46:06.880]  out on every hill and mountain and every valley and never stop because the
[46:06.880 --> 46:15.280]  people are now ready to hear the truth the people are now ready to awaken the
[46:15.280 --> 46:19.840]  people were stalled the people were hamstrung they were lied to they were
[46:19.840 --> 46:23.880]  told there is no carbon tax there is no global government there is no UN
[46:23.880 --> 46:29.080]  takeover there is no plan to bankrupt the banks to bankrupt the country there is
[46:29.080 --> 46:33.600]  no plan there is no private Federal Reserve there is no UN takeover there
[46:33.600 --> 46:39.200]  is no North American Union there is no NAFTA Super Highway just three years
[46:39.200 --> 46:44.280]  ago CNN would do newscast saying there's no such thing as a trans Texas corridor
[46:44.280 --> 46:47.840]  and NAFTA super highways even as the federal government announced it and put
[46:47.840 --> 46:54.280]  up billboards but the flat out lying I mean how dumb do they think you are how
[46:54.280 --> 46:57.760]  dumb do they think we are to sit there and tell you there's no North American
[46:57.760 --> 47:04.120]  Union when they officially signed the treaty in 2005 how dumb do they think
[47:04.120 --> 47:11.360]  you are to tell you there's no global government being set up how stupid do
[47:11.360 --> 47:18.000]  they think you are I see cars all over Austin driving around with bumper
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.600]  stickers saying Terra pass and that's what the global government says you're
[47:21.600 --> 47:25.680]  gonna have an ID card through your net national system that tracks all the gas
[47:25.680 --> 47:29.240]  you buy all the food you buy everything you buy and when your carbon credits
[47:29.240 --> 47:33.760]  run out the taxes only increase every item you buy will already have taxes on

[48:19.680 --> 48:23.640]  and windmills all these things that sound reasonable one at the core it's a
[48:23.640 --> 48:28.720]  police state tracking grid to further bankrupt all the poor families in the
[48:28.720 --> 48:32.960]  country and then you're gonna have CPS assessments and when you're poor they're

[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:46.560]  we are calling to confirm if what bill is saying is accurate now i believe his
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:50.560]  tone i've talked to a million callers but sometimes
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:54.240]  people make mistakes the reason preliminarily i
[1:08:54.240 --> 1:08:58.960]  believe it is because i'm already aware of this happening in some gun shows
[1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:04.640]  in texas and what they do is they over the years they get gun shows on one or
[1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:10.880]  two little violations of batf code most of the time made up
[1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:15.600]  then they intimidate them and say look if you work with us we'll leave you
[1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:18.640]  alone and they mount hidden cameras all over
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:22.240]  they'll have batf up in the ceiling or on the second floor
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:25.840]  or they'll have a walled off area with wall separators
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:31.520]  and the batf fbi federal marshals state police groups are all there
[1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:35.040]  surveilling everyone and an old man will come in sell his
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:38.000]  dear rifle walk out they'll arrest him in the parking lot and
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  charge him as a gun dealer it doesn't matter if it's legal
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:46.800]  to privately transfer firearms when you do the
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:50.480]  nix system you are instantly registered as a gun owner
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:53.920]  and the gun shops always love to say oh no we're not registering people
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:57.360]  because they don't want to scare folks off but you are being registered and i
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:00.720]  always explain that they would then without a judge without a jury without
[1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:04.000]  a conviction just say oh well you can't own a gun now
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.280]  because you're a person of interest you're on the homeland security list i
[1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:11.680]  said this before we had homeland security now they have the no fly no buy
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:15.120]  bill in the house but they don't care if the bill hadn't passed
[1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:18.160]  all over the country veterans people with no criminal record
[1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:22.320]  are going into buy guns and said sorry homeland security's got you on the list
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:25.200]  people that are suddenly on the no fly over a million
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:29.360]  200 000 since they made it secret a year ago they were adding 25 000 names a
[1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:31.280]  month federal marshals came out and said they were
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:35.440]  ordered to put innocent people on the list they had a quota no judge no jury
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:38.960]  you're just on a secret list we also know that
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:45.920]  Schwarzenegger got a law passed where you've got to be registered thumb printed
[1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:49.360]  to buy ammo ammo has to be behind the counter
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:53.200]  here in texas i've talked to one of my great uncles
[1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:56.640]  i've also talked to one of my cousins i haven't been in walmart to buy ammo or
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:02.800]  guns in years so i don't know but walmart nationwide
[1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:06.560]  and i've also seen this in the news gets id and
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:10.720]  makes a copy of your driver's license and makes you signed to buy ammo
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:14.000]  so total gun and ammo registration is happening
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:19.440]  but except for places like new york and california
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:24.160]  new york city and california it's being done extra judicially it's just
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:28.480]  random color of law it's criminal there should be congressional
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:32.480]  investigations the batf should be in trouble where are the supposed second
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:37.520]  amendment lobbies all over the nation realtors
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:41.360]  anyone that comes in your house are being paid
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:46.400]  the companies are being paid the big realty companies the plumbers
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:50.640]  the construction companies to spy and this has come out in the news
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:53.760]  what kind of guns do you have is there a gun case
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:58.160]  what did they look like try to take a photo with your iphone if you can
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:01.040]  doesn't matter if you think it's legal go ahead and call
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:04.640]  the local police they've got an intelligence bureau they file
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:08.720]  a lot of big cities the plumbers get basically a
[1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:12.720]  smaller check the people that are in your house get a smaller
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:17.600]  check just for the reports and so a lot of cities
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:21.600]  you go online and they file these reports a giant
[1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:26.240]  secret police archipelago that makes east germany look tame
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:31.600]  it's just everywhere a total grid of unamerican crime
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:35.840]  and they're going through the documents for the site right now
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:43.040]  but according to bill the tanner gun show ask for the last four digits of

[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:57.840]  we need more calls on this subject problems of callers getting through
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:01.680]  we need more people to send us emails to writers and info wars dot com and show

[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:34.000]  was happening inside bill well like i said
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.680]  we walked in we were the first eight or ten people
[1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:41.600]  and uh being sunday we had a snow storm up here there was less than a hundred
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:44.960]  that showed up for the whole show during the day but anyway
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:50.960]  after we paid our money and she stamped the back of each one of our hands
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:54.720]  we turned to walk in past the table and there were two ladies standing there
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:59.680]  with uh books in their hands and the lady says the last
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:04.160]  four of your social security number please and uh
[1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:06.960]  everybody started shouting out their numbers and they're writing down as
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:11.040]  fast as they could they could and we walked right on in
[1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:15.440]  but uh like i say we were the first eight or ten in the show and you could
[1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:20.960]  see four teams of two and these men were running
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:24.080]  to certain tables picking up certain weapons
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:27.600]  checking so we wanted to have a little fun so we
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:33.120]  darted over by this one team and he was quickly picking him up
[1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:38.400]  turning him over checking so my buddy you know being a clown he picked one up
[1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:41.680]  he's hey bill look at this got a switch on this is
[1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:46.960]  full and the guy almost had a heart attack him and his partner turned so fast
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:50.560]  they almost lost their heads and he looked at him and smiled and
[1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:54.320]  winked and put it back down he says have a nice day kids
[1:14:54.320 --> 1:14:58.400]  now we're older men we're we're close to 70 years old but you could tell these
[1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:02.240]  two of these two were they were agents and the other
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:05.440]  three teams were running around the room checking
[1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:11.600]  and uh i don't call uh i don't call them law enforcement officers i call them
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:15.840]  trouble makers and i'm very very surprised to hear
[1:15:15.840 --> 1:15:19.680]  what you've been saying about men of my age and
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:23.920]  ex-military and everything that uh we're going to be
[1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:27.600]  unable to defend our homes and our wives and our grandchildren
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:34.160]  that that hurts me immensely um well sir we have a completely
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:39.040]  rogue government with spy grids publicly brainwashing the kids
[1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:43.120]  i have the local austin training videos where they give the kids 200 bucks to
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:46.960]  report on their parents this is the opposite of freedom
[1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:50.880]  the opposite of the land of the free home of the brave but the issue of the
[1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:54.480]  social security number and everyone just submitting
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:58.880]  but notice how they got your money first it's like at disney world
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:06.080]  or at or at mall of america or at seaworld when you go through you pay
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:09.600]  your 20 30 50 bucks 100 bucks depending on
[1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:13.600]  you might be 85 dollars to get into disneyland disney world
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:17.360]  you pay and then you walk up and they say oh we're going to take a digital photo
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:21.840]  and a hand scan now and everyone just submits like people going into a gas
[1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:25.440]  chamber knowing you've already paid your money
[1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:29.280]  now i always say no and then they just let me through
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:32.000]  uh saying yeah we get some people that don't submit
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:36.160]  but this is the cashless control grid we're being trained for
[1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:39.520]  and those cops that were in there they love drinking fluoride
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:43.280]  and chlorine and mercury and lead that's in the water for their kids they love it
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:47.920]  when their 10-year-old gets leukemia they love serving the new world order
[1:16:47.920 --> 1:16:51.120]  they love taking the inoculations and trusting the system
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:55.520]  they love hunting the people down they love helping the cps grab a
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:58.640]  20-month-old baby as it cries in its mother's arms
[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:01.840]  ripping it away they get off on the power i've been at these things when
[1:17:01.840 --> 1:17:05.440]  it's happening and the cops kind of get this demonic look on their face to
[1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:09.200]  getting off on it oh they just love butchering america
[1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:13.200]  and we need to recognize who these people are and just how evil
[1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:17.760]  they are i and and and it's just sick sick
[1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:23.840]  to see this and uh it just makes me want to vomit
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:28.240]  in fact i'm going to open our phone system up because the genesis system is

[1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:15.600]  of registering gun owners
[1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:21.040]  but to get in the gun show after you pay just to get in not to go buy a firearm
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:25.200]  and most states it's not illegal to have private sales from person to person at
[1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:29.360]  the gun show they don't like that
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:33.920]  it's just incredible and we open the phones up for about 60 seconds and 11
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:37.760]  calls got through because we can take basically unlimited calls
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:42.000]  but we're going through these person after person having to show their id
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:45.920]  to get ammo or social security to get into gun shows
[1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:48.800]  and so it'll be next segment before we go to those people as we're having to
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:52.400]  answer all those calls let's go to adam in missouri i'm also going to be
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:55.760]  covering the kopenhagen summit the global government takeover happening
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:59.280]  right now adam in missouri are on the air
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:03.120]  thank you sir for taking my call i just want to commend you and uh... the
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:06.800]  listeners out there uh... that we are fighting a good fight
[1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:12.320]  and uh... i do have a few questions uh... one is about the uh... global
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:16.960]  warming back in the eighties uh... were about the same age uh... and uh...
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:19.120]  back in the eighties i remember in grade school
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:23.440]  they were saying carbon monoxide not dioxide but monoxide
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:28.320]  was actually harmful to the atmosphere and uh... and and that's one thing i
[1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:31.840]  think people are getting misconstrued thinking that the carbon dioxide out
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:34.480]  there and it is because people are asleep
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:37.600]  and uh... they need to be woken up because they're complacent with their
[1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:42.400]  video games and what have you but uh... but uh... which what your take do you
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:45.760]  think that we know you're absolutely right people are program without work
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:50.480]  is i get emails all the time saying how dare you say carbon monoxide isn't bad
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:56.080]  i'm saying dioxide that's what they're going to tax dioxide carbon dioxide
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:25:59.600]  not monoxide if you think we should
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:03.440]  i'm sorry go ahead no it's just it's just absolute idiocy
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:08.720]  and i was wondering do you think though uh... despite of the global dominance
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:13.280]  that they have on this market uh... do you think though that we should take
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:19.040]  measures to uh... renewable energies clean fuel things like that
[1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:22.160]  yes but what they do is they can decode their agenda
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:26.960]  around clean cars and windmills and you know technologies that certainly have
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:31.040]  some good usage it has nothing to do with that these are private banks
[1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:35.440]  that you'll have to buy carbon credits for they're already making hundreds of
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:38.880]  billions a year before it even officially launches
[1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:43.360]  on the new york chicago london berlin
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:49.520]  paris and other carbon trading exchanges okay so just ahead of the
[1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:52.560]  Copenhagen summit last week i was seeing the numbers
[1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:57.440]  of just billions being made a day on the carbon credits
[1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:01.280]  it's just made up derivative crud everything is a fraud
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:05.440]  so of course the fortune 500 and the big banks are all for this because they
[1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:10.480]  made the plan you you pay a tax to banks for derivatives
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:15.680]  they just make up taxing thin air it's the biggest fraud in the galaxy thank
[1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:20.400]  you adam mike in illinois you're on the air mike
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:24.240]  alex uh... let me introduce myself my name is mike saint trawler on the way
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:26.800]  i work closely with we are changing chicago

[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:40.320]  a wing radio white ring radio uh... to expose their problems but what i do is
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:43.360]  i'd like your listeners to try this psychology on them
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:45.680]  it's called a compliment sandwich and it works
[1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:49.440]  uh... fairly well what you do is you call in this is so you don't get hung up
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:53.360]  on uh... you call in and uh... you compliment on the show
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:56.800]  uh... you slam them with something very hard which which kind of puts them in a
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:00.560]  a a a pause and then you kind of end up in a show saying
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:03.840]  you know i'll be calling in later see you know if you checked in or looked into
[1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:06.080]  that it's worked out

[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:12.960]  and you gain a little respect that way they don't just block your number
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:17.600]  or uh... they you know what absolutely a lot of people that try to sneak past
[1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:20.960]  the establishment screeners will kind of rush it out
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:25.760]  or or act suspicious and then the people are on guard just calmly say hey

[1:33:24.240 --> 1:33:27.520]  to having to give their social security numbers or driver's license to go in
[1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:31.200]  gun shows or to buy ammo at places like walmart

[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:56.880]  wherever they take scrap aluminum to and anyways one of the things was uh they

[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:04.160]  and i just handed her in plastic and she said uh you have to take it out of
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:07.280]  there because i have to scan this and what it is that goes into the computer
[1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:09.440]  right system to make sure you're not stealing
[1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:12.800]  aluminum and here's the deal it's guilty until proven innocent i remember

[1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:49.840]  either late september or october and it was the first gun show i went to and
[1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:52.720]  while we were in the parking lot walking towards the entrance i actually
[1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:56.400]  noticed federal agents walking through the parking lot looking at license
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:40:59.920]  plates and me and my friends were like all right that's kind of strange
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:03.520]  yeah they're intimidating us into giving up our second amendment
[1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:07.920]  it's like we're jews and nazi germany and the wolves are swarming around us
[1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:11.440]  they can't wait to get into our flesh
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:15.120]  yeah and then we'll the funny thing is we go to the entrance and
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:19.280]  i paid with the card and she asked for my license and she took it and
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:22.720]  she was writing stuff down on a pad of paper and i honestly didn't think anything
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:25.840]  of it until i was listening earlier today and you brought it up
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:30.800]  and then i went inside and um the place looked like there was a lot of it
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:34.160]  seemed like the um kind of glenn bet crowd the fake
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:38.240]  patriot crowd there and there's also a lot of um
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:41.040]  it looked like there's a lot of federal federal agents walking around and they
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:44.480]  love the government they love being registered and put on a list
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:48.000]  the beat they they just kiss up to any uniform
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:52.800]  oh they can't wait till they're drug away to the fema camp they love it
[1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:56.480]  yeah i know and the the weirdest thing was there was this one table
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:00.080]  and there was no one around it and it was selling books and they had like
[1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:03.440]  the turner diaries and these other white supremacist folks and they had
[1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:08.320]  always federally run always there's a camera up in the ceiling above those
[1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:11.840]  and they're just right anybody buying that you're being put in a database
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:15.840]  next time you go to buy a gun they'll say sorry can't buy a gun now
[1:42:15.840 --> 1:42:18.960]  they actually did have a hidden camera above it one of those like
[1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:23.200]  of course no i have this from insiders no they're all surveilled
[1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:26.720]  it's all criminal yeah and then they had like the anarchist cookbook and then
[1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:29.120]  they had these other really weird books where i was looking through it and it
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:33.520]  was like yeah it's never mainline patriot stuff it's all for the news media
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:38.560]  to come in too and show it to demonize gun shows it's all in operation
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:42.320]  yeah exactly i mean they had these weird books and it was like guerrilla tactics
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:46.720]  and like urban warfare but it wasn't like it wasn't like a military manual this
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:50.400]  was like almost like a terrorist book or something and i'm thinking like
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:54.080]  you know this is so obvious that you know it's batf or their informants
[1:42:54.080 --> 1:42:58.240]  behind the counter fbi full surveillance the number one enemy of the
[1:42:58.240 --> 1:43:02.000]  globalist is the american people the entire homeland security system is for
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:05.280]  the american people uh the banks have taken over
[1:43:05.280 --> 1:43:08.560]  and and they're totally scared just like goldman sacks is arming to the teeth
[1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:12.480]  with weapons against the american people bloomberg reports they know they've
[1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:15.600]  committed crime they know they want to take over
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:19.280]  and they are scared to death of the american people i appreciate your call
[1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:22.400]  all right thank you now what's going to happen is when they implement martial
[1:43:22.400 --> 1:43:25.600]  law suddenly all gun owners credit cards aren't going to work

[1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:36.560]  when you pull up uh you know uh heavy you'll swing out from the back of a
[1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:39.360]  truck and the minute you don't go out they're just
[1:43:39.360 --> 1:43:43.200]  going to open up on you and and then in a few spots they'll kill a few cops and
[1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:45.680]  say you did it and put your dead body on the news

[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:43.360]  okay well first of all i thought maybe it's because i looked

[1:48:27.920 --> 1:48:30.880]  uh some ladies who were sitting there you know and they were asking for the
[1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:33.920]  last four digits of the social i mean we didn't have to pull out any
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:37.040]  id or anything again the feds have ordered this
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:39.920]  it's but see they don't need that they haven't listened they have a license
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:44.080]  plate reading cameras they're just checking that and then they flag even
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:47.600]  more whoever doesn't give it to you yeah i mean could you can see them all through
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:50.560]  the parking lot you know their golf carts going around and
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:53.760]  you know they don't even need that they're taking notes they can they can scan
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:58.080]  six thousand license plates a minute with the slower units when you drive in
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:01.840]  it's all being homeland security scanned then when you get out they've
[1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:05.680]  normally got a camera mounted on the roof they get a face scan then a
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:09.440]  satellite i'm not kidding dials in if they've got the sat time but they're
[1:49:09.440 --> 1:49:11.680]  but that's why they're launching hundreds more to do this
[1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:15.280]  then then they get your heat resonance they're using the gun shows to get your
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:21.200]  heat resonance uh a biometric uh body print uh to then track this is
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:24.080]  done in iraq as well it's a total grid you're now
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:27.680]  uploading to the sat grid and they can track you from space off your heat
[1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:30.320]  resonance pattern how do you like that that's not like a
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:33.440]  free country to you buddy uh no sir not at all
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:37.120]  how about i just go ahead and lay it all on you lay it on me

[1:49:56.720 --> 1:50:00.080]  well when i first when she first asked me for it i thought

[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:06.320]  she didn't ask me for an id so i just said one two three four
[1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:09.040]  and she looked down at her page and you can see where
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:12.880]  she was writing it down you know she was writing down you can see where she
[1:50:12.880 --> 1:50:16.640]  wrote like one two three four probably this is dog training this is dog
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:18.720]  training next like you just heard the caller
[1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:22.400]  they're gonna want to scan it but but they know how to incrementally train
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:26.640]  the psychologists have said that if you just let them be in control and not
[1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:30.320]  show anything you watch in one year you go back there
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:33.680]  they're gonna want to scan everything next they're gonna have a hand scanner
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:36.960]  there so what did she say when she wrote one two three four down

[1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:44.000]  he's coming by your guns now and it's like they were
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:48.400]  training you then and now you know they're they're asking for the last
[1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:51.520]  four digits and i guess next time and what they're gonna do when they launch
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:53.360]  their op what they're gonna do when they launch their
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:56.240]  operation is they're gonna gun patriots down on the news
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:50:59.120]  they're gonna kill cops and say we did it and then they're gonna have a full out

[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:07.840]  ladies and gentlemen three years ago google came out and said they're using
[1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:11.840]  the audio and video cameras on all new computers
[1:54:11.840 --> 1:54:16.720]  with ai computers inside your house to record everything you're saying and
[1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:19.920]  doing and they said don't worry a computer's just
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:24.560]  creating a text file that's that's been analyzed for advertising
[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:26.880]  imagine if your neighbor came to your house and said hey mind if i put a
[1:54:26.880 --> 1:54:30.720]  camera in your home watching you you'd you'd you'd freak out on them
[1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:33.600]  but google just announces it like it's no big deal that's what we've got to
[1:54:33.600 --> 1:54:37.280]  really start using start page dot com it's really just a proxy that goes
[1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:40.240]  through google but blocks them getting your data
[1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:44.160]  it says google ceo secrets are for filthy people
[1:54:44.160 --> 1:54:47.360]  eric schmidt suggests you are scandalous behavior
[1:54:47.360 --> 1:54:50.240]  before you complain about the company invading your privacy
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:53.920]  that's what the google ceo who's a big global warming tax guy
[1:54:53.920 --> 1:54:56.960]  told maria
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:01.120]  barter remo during cnbc's big google special last night
[1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:04.320]  an extraordinary pronouncement for such a secretive guy
[1:55:04.320 --> 1:55:08.800]  so here they are using all this data against you forcing you to give social
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:13.040]  security numbers to buy ammo outside the law just doing it the feds
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:15.600]  ordering it nationwide these companies aren't doing it
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:18.960]  by themselves we're going to go back to billy sherry jim and others this has
[1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:22.080]  happened to in a moment but here is the google
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:25.520]  ceo throwing it in your face that you're guilty
[1:55:25.520 --> 1:55:29.600]  until proven innocent no warrants no nothing all given to the feds
[1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:33.040]  we've got to guess the last hour about yahoo doing the same thing
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:37.520]  here it is we're treating google like their most trusted friend
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:42.080]  should they be well i think judgment matters
[1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:47.280]  eric schmidt is google ceo if you have something that you don't want anyone to
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:50.400]  know maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:54.960]  but if you really need that kind of privacy the reality is that search engines
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:55:58.560]  including google do retain this information for some time
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:02.400]  um and it's important for example that you we are all subject in the united
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:06.240]  states to the patriot act it is possible that that information could be made
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:12.720]  available to the authorities everything google is the nsa but
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:16.960]  so is every other major tech company you need to know that
[1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:21.920]  you need to understand that this is the global domination system
[1:56:21.920 --> 1:56:25.680]  okay period but don't let it chill you they're out announcing their
[1:56:25.680 --> 1:56:29.840]  surveilling you so you shut up and get scared you got to say look crux we don't
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:33.360]  like what you're doing and start videotaping them start putting
[1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:37.600]  their information out in the public see how they like it
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:41.680]  billy in pennsylvania what happened to you
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:47.120]  uh is go ahead
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:53.200]  hear me yes i can billy okay so i was at the valley force gun show
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:57.280]  and they had um like multiple boots set up
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:01.040]  and multiple bracelets you got when you went into the show
[1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:04.560]  uh one of them everybody had to show an i-day
[1:57:04.560 --> 1:57:08.160]  but they had another booth where you could uh go through
[1:57:08.160 --> 1:57:12.000]  our pennsylvania instant check if you wanted to
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:18.400]  and uh for go having to pay the entry fee for the gun show
[1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:23.920]  oh then they said that uh if you took the instant check
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:27.440]  there that you wouldn't have to do it if you bought a gun
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:31.200]  but that wasn't true because i ended up buying one and i thought these are
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:34.720]  criminals of course they lie
[1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:40.080]  so that's what happened to me and so you went ahead and went through it and
[1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:43.440]  then you went to buy a gun and they said no you got to do it again
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:47.200]  yeah well that's i didn't know anything about this and actually at the gun
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:50.640]  show is where i got my first copy of anything and see none of the gun
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:54.080]  magazines are reporting it no one's talking about it

[1:58:09.680 --> 1:58:13.120]  but when i say owned it's a total government front part of the national
[1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:17.600]  security grid okay well i went in there not to buy
[1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:21.520]  ammo or a gun but i went in there simply to get a land owner's permit for
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:26.880]  hunting and they had they required your driver's license

[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:33.120]  month ago but it was his last year hunting

[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:46.640]  pretty much knew it and he had trouble walking but we got him to the
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:50.640]  deer stand and then as a landowner in texas you can drive somebody else's
[2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:53.600]  deer to the processor they were taking it to have it made into
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:57.040]  steaks and sausage and in freestone county but

[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:09.600]  after call after call naming the gun shows where this has happened
[2:12:09.600 --> 2:12:13.840]  and i've already confirmed it's going on it's just good to actually hear it
[2:12:13.840 --> 2:12:18.640]  from the people the government just orders the gun shows to do it
[2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:22.960]  no law they're just intimidated by the batf goons to do it
[2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:26.800]  it is absolutely devastating let's take one more call on that subject
[2:12:26.800 --> 2:12:29.520]  then we're going to shut down my phone system and only open on special
[2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:33.680]  occasions and go back to the genesis calls for everybody that's holding
[2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:36.880]  perhaps genesis and give me a new call list
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:41.040]  because those calls have been holding for a while a fresh call list so i can
[2:12:41.040 --> 2:12:43.280]  make sure i'm going to callers that are actually there
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:47.200]  i appreciate the genesis phone calls for holding while i went over all that
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:50.400]  but let's get through a bunch of your calls right now
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:55.840]  uh let's go ahead and go to jim in utah jim what's your story
[2:12:55.840 --> 2:13:01.120]  well my story is in price utah i went to k mart to do some christmas shopping
[2:13:01.120 --> 2:13:07.840]  and i filled up a buggy full of merchandise went to buy my son a 22 rifle
[2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:11.760]  noticed there was no guns so i asked the service person
[2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:15.920]  where was there 22 rifles and they told me
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:22.560]  that the k mart have chosen not to sell the american people
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:28.560]  guns or ammunition or archery or any of that anymore
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:33.040]  yeah that happened with rosie o donald originally
[2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:36.480]  she called for them to stop selling guns and they did a few years
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:42.320]  after that but uh did you hear all the callers who
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:45.040]  were having to give drivers license to buy ammo
[2:13:45.040 --> 2:13:49.680]  yeah i went into walmart and uh was going to buy ammunition
[2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:54.240]  and they had a clipboard there and the first question now the mouth was is
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:14:00.640]  this for a handgun or a rifle and i asked them why they needed to know
[2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:06.480]  and they said before they could sell it to me that's the question they had to ask
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:10.160]  and then every walmart in the country takes your driver's license
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:15.280]  and scans it did did did they ask for that uh you know we didn't even get to
[2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:18.800]  that point i told them if i had to do all that i was going to live like a
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:22.000]  slave and in both cases i left both
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:26.080]  buggies of merchandise for them to restart themselves
[2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:29.200]  so anybody you know if they're not going to sell us guns and ammo i'd say go
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:32.640]  somewhere else and shop well i hear you and god bless you jim here's what's
[2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:36.400]  happening they can't pass the gun laws they want
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:40.400]  federally though they're trying they've got gun laws where the vatf
[2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:44.640]  can recommend to the attorney general and he can ban any guns he wants it just
[2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:48.160]  gives him imperial power that bill's got cosponsors right now
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:52.400]  they've got the no fly no buy no judge no jury no conviction no arrest no
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:55.440]  indictment they won't tell you how you got on the list you can't get off the
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:14:57.920]  list they just say you can't buy a gun anymore
[2:14:57.920 --> 2:15:01.200]  they're already doing that even though the bill hadn't passed that's already
[2:15:01.200 --> 2:15:05.440]  been implemented but in california and many other states
[2:15:05.440 --> 2:15:08.880]  texas has already tried this they make you thumb print
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:12.880]  and register to buy ammo every time you buy ammo but where they can't get it
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:16.240]  passes a law the vatf comes in and i've seen
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:20.560]  them do it with shaved heads their little mafia mustaches or goatees
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:24.000]  i mean they i mean they look like guys right out of a if i was casting for a
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:27.520]  hollywood movie and wanted criminals i would go hire vatf because they just
[2:15:27.520 --> 2:15:31.920]  look like real criminals they just a vapor of evil comes off of them
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:35.840]  it's it it's unbelievable and they come in and they go
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:39.200]  looks like you spelled this guy's name wrong you know they'll go through five
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:42.160]  thousand forms and find one spot where you didn't
[2:15:42.160 --> 2:15:46.560]  dot an i and they'll say i got you for fraud with firearm sales this is how
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:51.280]  they shut down most of the gun shops and they'll say or
[2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:54.880]  you start getting social security numbers anybody that buys ammo
[2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:58.400]  or buys a cleaning kit and i won't put you in prison
[2:15:58.400 --> 2:16:02.720]  you work for me now punk and they'll sit there and wet their pants and roll over
[2:16:02.720 --> 2:16:08.000]  in america dies by a million cuts and this is how they run america
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:12.080]  and they go in those gun shows and they say one old man sold three rifles
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:15.760]  in one month here we think that's firearms trafficking even though they're
[2:16:15.760 --> 2:16:18.960]  legally allowed to sell the guns we're gonna say you're allowing trafficking
[2:16:18.960 --> 2:16:23.200]  we're gonna indict this gun show for felonies unless you let us put
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:26.400]  surveillance cameras in and you get social security numbers from everybody
[2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:30.080]  do you understand and you know the you know the decadent weak
[2:16:30.080 --> 2:16:33.600]  gun shop owners like i don't care about the second amendment i just want money
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:36.560]  hell i'll help you put everybody in prison
[2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:41.200]  i'll do what you say i'll do it right now and that's how america dies and
[2:16:41.200 --> 2:16:44.160]  quietly the secret police are recruiting the kids
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:47.040]  and brainwashing them and having them write dossiers on their parents
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:50.400]  nationwide and the police are taking blood without warrants on the side of
[2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:53.680]  the road and they're questioning people's kids and taking them into
[2:16:53.680 --> 2:16:57.280]  and strip searches whenever they want and they're forcibly inoculating kids
[2:16:57.280 --> 2:17:00.720]  all over the country when the parents get mad they say shut up we're gonna do
[2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:03.280]  what we want and the government's just practicing
[2:17:03.280 --> 2:17:06.960]  criminality practicing evil practicing oppression
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:12.480]  practicing dominating everyone just like more than half a million women
[2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:16.480]  from 1922 to 1987 according to the
[2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:20.960]  seattle post intelligentser were taken and had their
[2:17:20.960 --> 2:17:25.680]  uterus is cut out they didn't just uh they didn't just tie their tubes
[2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:29.200]  they removed the entire uterus because they had an added soft kill
[2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:32.480]  and would debilitate a lot of them that's added fun
[2:17:32.480 --> 2:17:37.920]  44 percent of native american women were sterilized from 1970 1975 alone
[2:17:37.920 --> 2:17:41.040]  they weren't any type of health care they weren't told what the procedure was
[2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:44.960]  they were just knocked out and sterilized that's what this government is
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:48.480]  that they're putting drugs in your water they're sterilizing you they're
[2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:52.000]  giving your children bone cancer they admit it
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:56.640]  they brag that your animals and stupid and that there's nothing you can do to
[2:17:56.640 --> 2:17:59.360]  stop them they love it and these government bureaucrats love giving
[2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:03.760]  their kids big glasses of fluoride it's a giggling demonic spirit they always
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:06.080]  laugh about it you tell one of these evil servants of
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:08.960]  tyranny about how they're being hurt by the system they'll just giggle and give
[2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:12.800]  this little piggy smiles what i call it and it's just a spirit of submission
[2:18:12.800 --> 2:18:15.280]  to evil as long as they can hurt people under them
[2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:17.920]  they don't mind if they're getting hurt from those on top
[2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:22.000]  it's all about just cowardice a lot of people are scared of evil and scared of
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:25.760]  darkness and scared of the power of evil and so in a subconscious level they
[2:18:25.760 --> 2:18:30.000]  decide to join it and serve it and that's why we're an evil people we
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:33.520]  wear skulls and death and murder and the trappings and the
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:37.440]  symbols of our nation are all the colors and symbols of the
[2:18:37.440 --> 2:18:42.320]  nazis and the soviets and and and death and destruction is what we love
[2:18:42.320 --> 2:18:45.440]  and because we're just being bathed and prepared for the feast
[2:18:45.440 --> 2:18:50.400]  we're being washed and scrubbed and brought out on a silver palette to the
[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:53.120]  devils to you know to literally tear us to pieces and the
[2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:56.320]  globals will do what they did in the soviet union and in malice china and
[2:18:56.320 --> 2:19:00.320]  nazi germany they're just gonna murder and kill and slaughter and torture
[2:19:00.320 --> 2:19:04.960]  children and the whole grid is in place and they're just yes our great time of
[2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:08.240]  murder is almost here we've always hated america
[2:19:08.240 --> 2:19:12.560]  we've got secret police in place they're ready to wage war the public's lost
[2:19:12.560 --> 2:19:16.400]  their spirit to stand up soon the murder will begin
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:20.000]  it's not enough that we see ps and kill the kids in many cases and test
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:23.520]  radiation on foster children it's not enough that we radiate
[2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:27.440]  and and spray nerve gas on the troops and project shed and kill thousands and
[2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:32.080]  main thousands it's not enough that we put hiv and the factor eight drug
[2:19:32.080 --> 2:19:35.760]  product to give our million people hiv it's not enough we put hundreds of
[2:19:35.760 --> 2:19:39.760]  chemicals in the water it's not enough that 20 of the populations on prozac
[2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:43.280]  literally eating holes in their brains it's not enough we're feeding them gmo
[2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:46.960]  that sterilizes all the rodents when they tested on them it doesn't matter
[2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:50.240]  that's all just the setup this country's ready to be raped

[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:33.840]  can't make this up erin tell the story of what happened to you
[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:36.880]  trying to get a license a hunting license an ammo at walmart yeah i was in
[2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:39.120]  walmart last year getting a hunting license so i could
[2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:43.120]  hung with my dad my brother and i was posted right there you got to
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:47.760]  show your social security number because of child support bill
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:52.240]  blah blah blah it's like us code forty two six six six
[2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:55.520]  i said that's weird i don't want to give my social security number
[2:24:55.520 --> 2:24:58.720]  and i pointed at it and the employee kind of laughed he's like yeah that is
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:01.760]  weird he didn't end up taking my number but then again it's
[2:25:01.760 --> 2:25:06.320]  probably in that system already anyway but uh it's kind of freaky you know
[2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:09.280]  because they talk about mark of the beast and there it is in the bill
[2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:12.400]  number it's well you know the law says they can give a license it's
[2:25:12.400 --> 2:25:15.280]  illegal under the prophecy act of 86 to ask for
[2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:18.080]  social security so soon as you said no he didn't make you
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:21.280]  yeah yeah see how it's all just color along
[2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:24.000]  and it was never supposed to be for identification by the way clinton signed
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:27.200]  an executive order in 1997 this is in my film
[2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:31.760]  no 1994 but the film's in 1997 when i got arrested refusing a thumb scan
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:33.920]  and i handed out the executive order where they said they're going to take
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:37.840]  blood and urine at the dmvs now they never implemented that
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:41.200]  but now they're taking blood at checkpoints and they've admitted oh at
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:45.200]  birth we take every baby's blood for an illegal dna database
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:48.000]  is that the right bill jaren printed off i don't think so
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.880]  well the point is we need to dig that up and we need to go in there with a
[2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:54.480]  camera to walmart and show people that yeah it was posted right there i pointed
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:58.560]  right at it and the guy was like wow you know it does say 666
[2:25:58.560 --> 2:26:01.680]  i mean everyone knows well if you ever notice most bills are boring but if you
[2:26:01.680 --> 2:26:07.600]  just go to thomas.loc.gov and type in hr 666 or s 666
[2:26:07.600 --> 2:26:11.760]  it's always some really evil bill it's like a little joke with these guys
[2:26:11.760 --> 2:26:15.520]  oh yeah i mean it but i mean who would want to be associated
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:18.080]  with that number knowing what it's associated with
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:21.680]  and then it always is every time you have to imprint or give your id or
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:25.040]  you know embrace the government system basically well you know the barcodes
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:28.960]  algorithm is based on a key of 666 and i heard that like 12 years ago didn't
[2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:32.880]  believe it then i had the inventor of the barcode on and read papers on it
[2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:37.600]  the key code used to make it work is it's based on a 666
[2:26:37.600 --> 2:26:41.280]  yeah well it's you know it's real close to two-thirds in math so
[2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:44.320]  of course that's why the egyptians had it as the calculation in their temples to
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:47.440]  the sun it was 666 so yeah it's the sun god
[2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:51.360]  calculation yeah but that's like 33 to have it associated with the
[2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:57.120]  the 666 is a doubling of 33 and 33 is pi right yeah
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:00.800]  there's thirds repeating six yeah so i mean but let you have understanding
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:03.840]  that's the number that this system works with computers on
[2:27:03.840 --> 2:27:07.280]  how'd they know that 2000 years ago erin that's for
[2:27:07.280 --> 2:27:11.360]  can't answer that for you but it's strange but uh they shouldn't be
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:14.320]  associating that with it's just telling us we're slaves
[2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:18.400]  with anyone who can read that number knows what it means
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:21.920]  666 hey you ought to take a still camera
[2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:24.720]  i know i think the little cameras are gone right now with the crew but we need
[2:27:24.720 --> 2:27:28.880]  to buy some more little hidden cameras and we need to get in there
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:34.880]  uh and uh people don't know this is going on they don't understand
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:40.080]  it's real though it's sold in walmart which is already like mark of the beast land
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:43.200]  how was your trip to florida to interview dr paul craig roberts
[2:27:43.200 --> 2:27:46.480]  oh it's nice he knows so much you know and he's getting sick of the tyranny i
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:50.080]  think you think so maybe he seems fed up with it yeah
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:54.320]  maybe he's uh maybe he's evil maybe homeland secret maybe we're all bad
[2:27:54.320 --> 2:27:57.600]  maybe the government's really good erin maybe they're doing this all for our
[2:27:57.600 --> 2:28:00.480]  safety erin dinecore and halibut running the
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:04.000]  child kidnapping rings publicly yeah it must be
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:08.560]  yeah they're doing it for everyone's safety 666
[2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:11.760]  again that's for your safety
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:18.800]  it's for your safety erin i see it just creeps me out i mean it really does
[2:28:18.800 --> 2:28:22.320]  i don't want to deal with these people anyway but and now they've announced the
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:25.440]  head of the u n and al gore and all of them announced oh it's a global
[2:28:25.440 --> 2:28:29.120]  religion we're launching and you must be part of it
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:33.120]  a glow i mean it you can't make this up i mean it's all happening the churches
[2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:37.520]  are on the government payroll almost all of them total tyranny is coming in
[2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:40.000]  i'm going to come back and go to calls and then i'm getting into the latest
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:43.520]  climate change development where they openly have been caught more fraud

[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:51.760]  involving the fraud total criminality coming out

[2:28:54.880 --> 2:28:58.320]  which the us can't get out of unless a unanimous vote
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:02.880]  by 190 something signatures that's not good
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:05.840]  does that sound like freedom where your country can't get out of it
[2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:08.800]  just like the united nations treaty where everything's backwards to our
[2:29:08.800 --> 2:29:13.120]  constitution yeah well it gives you 29 great freedoms
[2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:16.000]  gives you it says oh we give you this whereas our

[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:26.560]  their system says in then in article 29 30 oh by the way you have none of these
[2:29:26.560 --> 2:29:29.600]  rights when we say but most of their so-called rights are your right to be
[2:29:29.600 --> 2:29:33.440]  subjected to their eugenics system and see you hear them wanting to ban
[2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:36.640]  christmas music and malls that's the new thing it's just about them setting the
[2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:41.760]  precedent like no we give you the culture we want

[2:33:31.520 --> 2:33:35.680]  but more importantly the the stuff that funds our operation is also the
[2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:38.640]  information that blows the new world order sky high
[2:33:38.640 --> 2:33:43.040]  so i want to encourage all of the listeners to not procrastinate
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:47.520]  and do order fall of the republic on dvd my greatest film
[2:33:47.520 --> 2:33:51.120]  america's last stand make the choice liberty or tyranny
[2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:54.560]  fall the republic documents how an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting
[2:33:54.560 --> 2:33:57.600]  the u.s economy by design leaders are now declaring that world
[2:33:57.600 --> 2:34:00.640]  government has arrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new
[2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:03.200]  global currency president obama has brazenly
[2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:06.000]  violated article one section nine of the u.s constitution
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:09.120]  by seating himself at the head of the united nation security council
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:12.080]  thus becoming the first u.s president to chair the world body
[2:34:12.080 --> 2:34:15.280]  a scientific dictatorship is in the final stages of completion
[2:34:15.280 --> 2:34:18.320]  and laws protecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide
[2:34:18.320 --> 2:34:22.240]  an iron curtain of high-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet
[2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:25.360]  a worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite
[2:34:25.360 --> 2:34:29.520]  is implementing a planetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human
[2:34:29.520 --> 2:34:32.800]  activity and establish a system of neo feudal slavery
[2:34:32.800 --> 2:34:36.400]  the image makers have carefully packaged obama as the world savior
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:40.000]  he is the trojan horse manufacturer to pacify the people just long enough for
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:43.520]  the globalists to complete their master plan this film reveals the architecture
[2:34:43.520 --> 2:34:45.840]  of the new world order and why the power elite
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:49.120]  have in store for humanity more importantly communicates how
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:52.640]  we the people can retake control of our government turn the criminal tide and
[2:34:52.640 --> 2:34:57.920]  bring the tyrants to justice when you get follow the republic until christmas

[2:35:08.160 --> 2:35:11.760]  several different selections there i added those because some of the obama

[2:35:14.800 --> 2:35:18.400]  at least the other shirt which i think is one of my other favorites
[2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:22.800]  available at info wars dot com and your purchase supports this operation that
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:24.880]  we're trying to expand against the globalist

[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:32.240]  to call eight eight eight two five three three one three nine
[2:35:32.240 --> 2:35:36.400]  and uh until christmas we've done this every year for almost six years
[2:35:36.400 --> 2:35:40.720]  prison planet dot tv five and a half months free so you pay for six and a

[2:38:04.480 --> 2:38:08.960]  waking up with 22 years old um i have a new lease on life now my first
[2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:12.160]  question um i have a suggestion i asked my first suggestion
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:15.520]  uh then a question is uh you should get this guy's name is jack van impie
[2:38:15.520 --> 2:38:18.720]  uh he he talked about the new world order a christian guy
[2:38:18.720 --> 2:38:23.040]  um i think he talks on a christian station
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:27.440]  uh his name is jack van impie my question is um i hear about all this um
[2:38:27.440 --> 2:38:31.360]  world government and it's apparent it's obvious that you know that it's uh
[2:38:31.360 --> 2:38:36.160]  that it's coming but um my question is like you talk about this um
[2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:39.600]  uh one world religion that they talk about um
[2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:43.280]  my question is like what who do you think uh would be the head
[2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:50.800]  of this uh one world religion expand on that like um
[2:38:50.800 --> 2:38:54.960]  the bible would call it the antichrist um my question is like who do you see like
[2:38:54.960 --> 2:38:58.160]  i mean not even not even biblically speaking um
[2:38:58.160 --> 2:39:02.800]  who do you see as kind of being groomed to be the head of it
[2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:06.800]  would you rule out prince charles or
[2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:12.240]  well regardless it's world government and people make the parallels a
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:15.120]  revelation a world religion being announced by the
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:18.160]  un and the e you a global system where all human
[2:39:18.160 --> 2:39:22.640]  activity is tracked and traced and controlled uh it's it's it's just a
[2:39:22.640 --> 2:39:27.840]  hellish system that's being set up my uh my suggestion is that uh i don't
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:31.280]  know if you guys are like uh if you guys would get that guy on jack van impie
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:33.840]  but he seems to know what he's talking about

[2:40:16.400 --> 2:40:20.400]  from the uh uh anchorage second amendment task force and i wanted to let you
[2:40:20.400 --> 2:40:23.360]  know that they are affecting some change up there in anchorage
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:28.080]  they actually got uh palmer which is right next to lost over where
[2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:32.400]  your friend sarah pale came from uh they got him to drop some
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:38.080]  uh gun laws that were restricting the uh free carry of people in the
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:41.440]  in the city uh because people spoke up about their
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:45.040]  tension and they got him to drop it i want to bring that to you
[2:40:45.040 --> 2:40:49.680]  recently yes when we fight back against the gun
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:53.200]  control the victim disarmament we gain ground
[2:40:53.200 --> 2:40:56.400]  that's why we have to get angry and be focused and know
[2:40:56.400 --> 2:40:59.920]  the globalist strategy is to restrict our guns at the county city
[2:40:59.920 --> 2:41:03.600]  and state level and through color of law fraud
[2:41:03.600 --> 2:41:07.600]  the feds have all the major gun shops and gun shows
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:11.360]  registering people to buy ammo when there's only
[2:41:11.360 --> 2:41:15.920]  laws on that in chicago new york city and in california now
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:21.120]  so we've we've got to fight because this victim disarmament this slave disarmament
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:24.880]  is really expanding right now i sent the uh link
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:28.880]  to erin so maybe you got to put it up and show people that when you speak up
[2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:31.520]  and what you're talking about you can't affect change
[2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:37.440]  good job dan appreciate the call jim in texas jim you're on the air welcome
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:42.800]  hey let's take my call man welcome jim hey uh i'm a non-commissioned officer
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:46.000]  up here at fort hood and uh there's a couple things you might
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:49.520]  actually already talked about this before but uh there's a base
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:54.080]  sticker you have to get it required it's required to get on post
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:58.320]  and uh with that it's uh you get an rf5d tracking chip in your window
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:02.320]  and uh recently i guess it's recently they just started
[2:42:02.320 --> 2:42:07.120]  uh doing facial scans and uh let me also state that none of my opinions stated
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:10.640]  here reflect that as a department of defense i don't want to get
[2:42:10.640 --> 2:42:15.840]  any trouble here well remember that when we got the homeland security
[2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:18.720]  documents and broke them in the myack reports
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:22.240]  it states al qaeda is not one homeland security for
[2:42:22.240 --> 2:42:26.720]  the number one enemy of north com and homeland security
[2:42:26.720 --> 2:42:30.000]  because they're controlled by offshore banks they're criminal
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:34.560]  is the veterans gun owners libertarians and conservatives
[2:42:34.560 --> 2:42:37.760]  and then notice how that was repeated by the adl
[2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:42.000]  that the big enemy the big threat is people that don't want big government
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:46.320]  that don't want socialism that don't want to have their guns taken
[2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:49.760]  and so the entire homeland security system
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:53.520]  just like it came out in the newspapers months after we first broke it the army
[2:42:53.520 --> 2:42:57.280]  internally sent us that document others published it
[2:42:57.280 --> 2:43:01.600]  the baltimore sun reported on it that the in the fed rallies
[2:43:01.600 --> 2:43:04.960]  have army intelligence watching them ron paul
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:09.040]  myself and it says as potential terrorists know
[2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:15.840]  the people following first amendment protesters around saying we're terrorists
[2:43:15.840 --> 2:43:20.160]  are the terrorist right and i wanted to share with you
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:23.520]  something else uh it's the department of defense
[2:43:23.520 --> 2:43:29.040]  directive 1344.10 and that's what protects soldiers
[2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:32.800]  and their ability to go write letters to newspapers
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:37.520]  to express their opinions and to be heard on shows like yours
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:41.600]  i heard the active duty soldier call in and say that he could get in trouble
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:43.920]  for what he was doing but that's actually
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:48.640]  false as long as you kind of follow the guidelines set up for you and that you
[2:43:48.640 --> 2:43:51.680]  can do just as i'm doing that's right when you're off duty
[2:43:51.680 --> 2:43:56.240]  as long as you don't talk bad about the commander in chief or your superiors
[2:43:56.240 --> 2:44:01.840]  or directly against policies uh as a soldier you can talk
[2:44:01.840 --> 2:44:05.840]  when you're wearing the hat of a civilian all you want
[2:44:05.840 --> 2:44:09.920]  and look sir they're just letting you know you're being face scanned you were
[2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:13.200]  always being face scanned face scanning cameras have been in for 20 years
[2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:16.480]  DARPA put them in uh license plate readers have been in
[2:44:16.480 --> 2:44:21.200]  for at least 20 years now off the license plate reader
[2:44:21.200 --> 2:44:25.360]  then the ground-based camera can identify off your license plate that that's
[2:44:25.360 --> 2:44:29.840]  joe smith getting out of his car then they get a heat
[2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:33.120]  resident scan off your face that's now uploaded
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:37.360]  they get a overview shot to your heat residents
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:41.600]  and then with satellites they can track your heat residents
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:45.600]  i mean sir it's so buck rogers that's why the head of google
[2:44:45.600 --> 2:44:48.880]  is out there saying yeah we watch everything you do you know that's why
[2:44:48.880 --> 2:44:52.640]  yahoo is openly announcing that they just give everything to the feds no
[2:44:52.640 --> 2:44:56.480]  warrants that the local police can get everything they want no warrants
[2:44:56.480 --> 2:45:00.240]  it's just a lawless criminal government bloomberg's reporting
[2:45:00.240 --> 2:45:03.760]  the goldman sacks is arming itself with weapons against the public
[2:45:03.760 --> 2:45:07.360]  they know they've robbed us blind they know they're illegitimate
[2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:10.720]  just like stalin and hitler and mal armed against the people
[2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:16.640]  and they want our guns and um i mean did the military at ford hood wake up
[2:45:16.640 --> 2:45:19.920]  when the mayak and homeland security report came out saying the number one
[2:45:19.920 --> 2:45:25.440]  threat to america is veterans
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:28.560]  i've always been a pretty big advocate of the constitution
[2:45:28.560 --> 2:45:31.680]  and i pass out pocket constitutions to my soldiers
[2:45:31.680 --> 2:45:35.440]  and i regularly quiz them on uh what we're what we're held
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:39.360]  by uh you know by by law and by our god to hold up
[2:45:39.360 --> 2:45:42.080]  and that is the constitution of the united states of america and that is to
[2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:46.000]  protect the people so there are there are lawful orders
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:50.240]  uh we are uphold to protect and and support but at the same time
[2:45:50.240 --> 2:45:55.120]  uh we have a right to defend that document over unlawful orders
[2:45:55.120 --> 2:45:58.400]  hey then to that my friend i appreciate your call jim
[2:45:58.400 --> 2:46:02.720]  how many soldiers are waking up out there on the base
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:07.520]  um how many soldiers um i'm in a smaller unit
[2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:10.640]  so i couldn't really be specific on that but
[2:46:10.640 --> 2:46:15.920]  uh you see a lot less of the uh of the george bush stickers on
[2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:20.080]  obviously you got office but uh and on all that you don't see the uh
[2:46:20.080 --> 2:46:23.520]  the neoconservative banner like you did before
[2:46:23.520 --> 2:46:27.040]  and obviously with the new administration uh
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:31.680]  he uh you see a lot i'm trying to not be specific on certain things not put
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:35.760]  myself in any sort of trouble but you see a lot of change and uh
[2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:40.560]  everybody's waking up out here alex so the troops are aware of the new world
[2:46:40.560 --> 2:46:45.840]  order absolutely well we uh we've been uh
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:48.400]  it's a lot of stuff that i'd love to say
[2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:52.080]  but uh you know i don't want to i don't want to uh paint myself
[2:46:52.080 --> 2:46:56.080]  into are the troops suspicious of the shooting out there
[2:46:56.080 --> 2:47:00.800]  um well alex let me just uh comment on that real briefly
[2:47:00.800 --> 2:47:04.160]  and i had a a good friend of mine a non-commissioned officer fellow
[2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:07.600]  non-commissioned officer he was there and he was actually
[2:47:07.600 --> 2:47:11.520]  helping uh with the wounded soldiers and getting them
[2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:14.880]  to the ambulances and holding the IVs and whatnot
[2:47:14.880 --> 2:47:18.240]  and and he said to me that he saw the shooter on the ground
[2:47:18.240 --> 2:47:21.600]  now this could be just attributed to all the adrenaline rush but you know most
[2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:25.360]  of us have felt before in warfare uh but he said he saw the shooter on the
[2:47:25.360 --> 2:47:28.960]  ground disarmed uh shot several times and he still
[2:47:28.960 --> 2:47:32.400]  heard gunfire so now whether that's true
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:36.160]  or not i'm not well that's what all the reports are from hood
[2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:40.000]  and it turns out they knew everything he was doing he thought he was emailing
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:44.800]  al-qaeda he was lcaida he was emailing the cia posing as al-qaeda
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:49.600]  he was being protected they used that imam who's who who's the honey pot for
[2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:53.360]  all these all these synthetic al-qaeda they've got they do
[2:47:53.360 --> 2:47:56.720]  find mentally ill people like him and they protected him
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:00.560]  and congress has asked homeland security in the pentagon for that data
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:04.160]  and they've declared national security on it so bare minimum
[2:48:04.160 --> 2:48:08.000]  it's like the first world trade center bombing uh where their own
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:11.920]  informant said they told me cook the bomb train the drivers then
[2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:15.840]  we were supposed to bust them but they said no let the bombing go forward
[2:48:15.840 --> 2:48:20.400]  and so bare minimum this was a provocateur action
[2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:23.280]  i mean no one else would be allowed to be running around the base
[2:48:23.280 --> 2:48:26.640]  and when he was in medical school saying i love suicide bombers
[2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:30.560]  anybody else said that they'd have been out in 10 seconds he was protected
[2:48:30.560 --> 2:48:36.720]  the entire time and allowed to do this and it's disgusting
[2:48:36.720 --> 2:48:40.960]  on that but uh my heart goes out to all those that were
[2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:44.880]  that were shot and and all the families that were affected but uh
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:48.640]  but it does seem a little odd to us to some of us but you know once again
[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:53.120]  there's not a whole lot uh yeah well most of my family are former military
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:56.080]  and they all just said and a lot of them don't even agree with me politically
[2:48:56.080 --> 2:48:59.120]  they go that's something's going on that's a bunch of bull
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:03.440]  i mean anybody who knows has got their head screwed on knows the staged event
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:06.400]  when you see it god bless you and i appreciate your call jim
[2:49:06.400 --> 2:49:10.640]  we don't know exactly what happened but it stinks to high heaven doesn't it
[2:49:10.640 --> 2:49:14.800]  stinks to high heaven uh let's play vaughn rompy uh now there are so many
[2:49:14.800 --> 2:49:18.160]  i could play the u n head bancai moon i can play al gore
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:22.560]  saying copenhagen is the heart of world government for global governance and
[2:49:22.560 --> 2:49:27.120]  this is the year of world government now if you talk about this though
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:30.560]  homeland security the adl and everybody else
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:33.600]  are going to say you're wearing nazi underwear what does this have to do with
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:36.640]  nazis only that hitler wanted a european union
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:40.640]  so i guess those that want a global union are actually for hitler
[2:49:40.640 --> 2:49:43.920]  but doesn't matter you're wearing swastika underwear if you play this clip
[2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:50.480]  here's the head of the eu two weeks ago 2009 is also the first year of global
[2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:54.160]  governance with the establishment of the g20 in the middle of the financial
[2:49:54.160 --> 2:49:58.720]  crisis the climate conference in copenhagen
[2:49:58.720 --> 2:50:04.160]  is another step towards the global management of our planet
[2:50:04.160 --> 2:50:08.400]  our mission our presidency is one of hope
[2:50:08.400 --> 2:50:15.600]  supported by acts and by deeds okay now i'm going to continue into the next

[2:50:43.760 --> 2:50:51.680]  energy and green infrastructure uh and then just uh two weeks ago
[2:50:51.680 --> 2:50:55.200]  the house of representatives passed the waxman

[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:12.960]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[2:52:12.960 --> 2:52:16.160]  americans at home i have turned a tremendous influence
[2:52:16.160 --> 2:52:20.160]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:25.440]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[2:52:25.440 --> 2:52:28.640]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation

[2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:19.680]  from krypton.org yahoo is threatening to sue them
[2:54:19.680 --> 2:54:23.520]  right now here's the info wars dot com headline from curtain
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:27.280]  memo yahoo threatens krypton over leaked
[2:54:27.280 --> 2:54:30.960]  surveillance document no warrants no nothing
[2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:35.040]  the police want your data they want your emails they want your instant messages
[2:54:35.040 --> 2:54:39.360]  it's just given for a small fee and then i thought i would just pull one
[2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:43.520]  article up from a few years ago Missouri tracks scoff laws via
[2:54:43.520 --> 2:54:46.880]  pizza delivery databases that give me a document cam
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:52.720]  shot of this and it says that and this is from many years ago
[2:54:52.720 --> 2:54:56.480]  usa today actually running an ap article and it says yeah
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:55:00.240]  all the big pizza chains when you call to get a pizza they run a background
[2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:02.640]  check on you let the police know where you're at
[2:55:02.640 --> 2:55:06.560]  see everything is a control grid face scanning cameras
[2:55:06.560 --> 2:55:11.120]  license plate reading cameras heat resonance uh remember i tell you 14
[2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:14.400]  years ago how all babies in commonwealth countries including the us were
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:18.240]  really a basically a commonwealth nation of the same agreements
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:22.480]  had your blood taken for a dna database declassified earlier this year
[2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:26.560]  exactly as i told you uh because i was reading university of texas documents
[2:55:26.560 --> 2:55:31.840]  how they were one of the four suppositories uh in uh
[2:55:31.840 --> 2:55:38.960]  the country suppository depository uh in the nation for that
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:42.400]  information and and and they're just holding your blood
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:46.000]  and they're using it for dna testing member dick cheney in the september
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:48.640]  20 of 2000 and rebuilding america's defenses
[2:55:48.640 --> 2:55:52.080]  document he said we've got to legitimize through the media
[2:55:52.080 --> 2:55:56.320]  the use of race specific bio weapons and you have the cold springs harbour
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:56:01.040]  human genome program remember my film in game three years ago i exposed dr
[2:56:01.040 --> 2:56:04.800]  watson as a top u genesis who doesn't believe blacks or humans
[2:56:04.800 --> 2:56:11.360]  he's the discoverer of the double helix of dna these are the crypto nazis the
[2:56:11.360 --> 2:56:15.120]  underground because the hitler got all his ideas from the us in england
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:20.400]  he thanked us u genesis and british u genesis in my comp for my struggle
[2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:25.520]  and so the human genome project's main goal is race specific bio weapons
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:28.720]  the problem is we're all so closely interrelated
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:32.240]  that say of israel which looked into this with south africa
[2:56:32.240 --> 2:56:35.680]  wants to create a race specific soft kill weapon or hard kill weapon for the
[2:56:35.680 --> 2:56:42.000]  arabs they can't because so many jewish people actually are
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:45.520]  sephardic and so they actually have that middle eastern blood and it'll just
[2:56:45.520 --> 2:56:48.800]  wipe them out and kill them and you know that's the problem
[2:56:48.800 --> 2:56:52.240]  well i mean hiv clearly we've had top virologist and scientists and genetic
[2:56:52.240 --> 2:56:56.560]  engineers on it has the the the the couplers
[2:56:56.560 --> 2:57:02.560]  for the white blood cells in black people and northern europeans do not
[2:57:02.560 --> 2:57:06.640]  even have the couplers it's very hard for a northern european
[2:57:06.640 --> 2:57:09.840]  and the studies are there that whites who even have similar
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:13.280]  high-risk sex partners especially northern europeans
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:18.800]  it's very hard to get hiv but blacks pretty much instantly get it
[2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:22.160]  but i'm i'm now digressing the point is they're taking your blood
[2:57:22.160 --> 2:57:25.600]  and if they want to create a race specific bio weapon just for you
[2:57:25.600 --> 2:57:29.200]  the state of the art science is there they just go remove the sample
[2:57:29.200 --> 2:57:33.600]  they can make the bio weapon just for you and then kill you better in a hammer
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:39.360]  so that's how this loving system works and so i thought we would go over some
[2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:42.240]  of that but i i already digress i was just
[2:57:42.240 --> 2:57:48.160]  getting into the overall surveillance grid uh of control they've got your blood
[2:57:48.160 --> 2:57:51.760]  they've got your heat resonance scan they're tracking you
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:55.680]  they're they've got psychological algorithms on all your web surfing in
[2:57:55.680 --> 2:57:59.920]  fact i said we finish al gore finish up with al gore and then let's get
[2:57:59.920 --> 2:58:04.400]  uh mr schmitt when he's not calling for global taxation
[2:58:04.400 --> 2:58:08.320]  bragging about how they're surveilling everyone and saying it's no big deal
[2:58:08.320 --> 2:58:11.680]  you're guilty until proven innocent but first here's al gore
[2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:19.360]  excess but it is the awareness itself that will drive
[2:58:19.360 --> 2:58:23.520]  the change and one of the ways it will drive the change is through
[2:58:23.520 --> 2:58:28.960]  global governance and global agreements but the many business leaders who have
[2:58:28.960 --> 2:58:35.600]  been present here are among those taking leadership in other ways
[2:58:35.600 --> 2:58:42.240]  we talked for example about they ride back with the final hour
[2:58:42.240 --> 2:58:50.320]  you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[2:58:50.320 --> 2:58:53.840]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[2:58:53.840 --> 2:58:57.040]  power generator number one new climate legislation
[2:58:57.040 --> 2:58:59.280]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:58:59.280 --> 2:59:03.520]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:59:03.520 --> 2:59:07.120]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[2:59:07.120 --> 2:59:10.640]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:14.320]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:59:14.320 --> 2:59:17.280]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:59:17.280 --> 2:59:21.120]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:24.480]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[2:59:24.480 --> 2:59:28.240]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[2:59:28.240 --> 2:59:31.120]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:59:31.120 --> 2:59:34.160]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[2:59:34.160 --> 2:59:36.880]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more
[2:59:36.880 --> 2:59:42.160]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[3:00:08.480 --> 3:00:12.880]  okay here's what's gonna happen for two segments i've got the webmaster of
[3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:16.480]  cryptome.org really doing a great job
[3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:23.120]  reporting on just the open surveillance no Bella rights no constitution
[3:00:23.120 --> 3:00:27.120]  just need to let you know what's going on there then the last 30 minutes i'm
[3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:31.280]  going to get into the latest on Copenhagen and the EPA
[3:00:31.280 --> 3:00:34.640]  in line with that saying they're going to list carbon dioxide that
[3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:38.480]  humans exhale that plants live off of that they respirate with
[3:00:38.480 --> 3:00:43.120]  then they put off oxygen that's the cycle of life taxing that and Maurice
[3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:46.480]  Strong is on record at the UN saying we're going to destroy industrial
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:49.760]  society make people so poor they can't have children
[3:00:49.760 --> 3:00:52.800]  then the state is going to take everyone's children at birth and raise them
[3:00:52.800 --> 3:00:55.760]  in government dormitories that's also in the White House
[3:00:55.760 --> 3:00:58.960]  science czar's book how they're going to put chemicals in the water to
[3:00:58.960 --> 3:01:03.600]  sterilize you and the family just so happens the 150 plus on average
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:06.880]  some it's over 300 chemicals added to your water supply
[3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:10.960]  under the product named sodium fluoride it's not just sodium fluoride
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:14.000]  just so happen to sterilize all known mammal species
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:17.920]  massively reduced fertility and cause bone cancer brain cancer
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:22.480]  and attack the thyroid so enjoy yourselves out there while you're
[3:01:22.480 --> 3:01:25.520]  drinking that and of course you don't believe me just google eco science
[3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:28.960]  calls for global government adding chemicals to water to sterilize
[3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:33.120]  you'll get ap and Reuters on that this is your loving government
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:36.800]  this is who runs things this is this is the people who openly say they're
[3:01:36.800 --> 3:01:40.880]  already killing you we're just supposed to sit here and
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:44.400]  take it and go watch the football game and go oh i love it that you take all
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:49.520]  the baby's blood at birth for your bio weapons program oh it's so nice of you
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:52.800]  let's play this clip of schmidt then i'll jam in a few calls if we have time
[3:01:52.800 --> 3:01:56.720]  here's the head of google who had turned out his houses you can't see what
[3:01:56.720 --> 3:01:59.760]  street view his houses you can't see what satellite photos
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:04.080]  his information is all protected and he admitted three years ago
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:08.000]  uh through a patent that google got they're using the audio
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:11.920]  sensor the microphone and the video camera to listen to you in real time
[3:02:11.920 --> 3:02:15.600]  but he said don't worry humans aren't computers are creating text
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:20.560]  like nsa text echelon text that then do an algorithm to this if they hear a dog
[3:02:20.560 --> 3:02:23.600]  barking dog food ads pop up oh you didn't know that's why that's
[3:02:23.600 --> 3:02:26.320]  happening it's not just cookies of where you go
[3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:30.240]  it's already in place just they're listening to you openly bragging
[3:02:30.240 --> 3:02:34.880]  and this is what he has to say about it on cnbc or treating google like their
[3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:41.120]  most trusted friend should they be well i think judgment matters
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:46.320]  eric schmidt is google ceo if you have something that you don't want anyone to
[3:02:46.320 --> 3:02:48.960]  know maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place
[3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:52.000]  huh but if you really need that kind of privacy
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:55.680]  the reality is that search engines including google do retain this
[3:02:55.680 --> 3:02:59.280]  information for some time um and it's important
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:02.960]  for example that you we are all subject in the united states to the patriot act
[3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:07.840]  it is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities
[3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:11.520]  what a great setup for our next guest coming up
[3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:17.680]  see oh from do no evil don't be evil uh to oh we don't surveil any of you don't
[3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:22.240]  worry it's no big deal just look we got satellite scans all your heat
[3:03:22.240 --> 3:03:26.480]  residents we're totally controlling you uh we're already spiking your water
[3:03:26.480 --> 3:03:29.520]  supply ha ha ha there's nothing you can do i mean it's just
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:34.240]  hey you know you don't deserve to live in privacy you don't deserve
[3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:38.000]  there's no fourth amendment you are going to be surveilled
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:41.280]  that's the way it is and we're going to use microphones to listen to you in
[3:03:41.280 --> 3:03:46.080]  your house by the way you don't believe me just use google google google to use
[3:03:46.080 --> 3:03:49.840]  cameras in computers to surveil you we wrote articles about that three years
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:54.320]  ago with links to press releases by google
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:03:58.080]  and then and then yahoo came out and said oh our system's better
[3:03:58.080 --> 3:04:02.080]  we're surveilling you better and then again this is the in
[3:04:02.080 --> 3:04:09.760]  your face system it's way past 1984 it's way past and
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:12.960]  here's another tidbit notice the movies every movie i see now
[3:04:12.960 --> 3:04:17.440]  has people being tasered and it's funny torture is funny and pain compliance
[3:04:17.440 --> 3:04:21.680]  is taught to all our police now you know you can't torture lc iada

[3:04:24.640 --> 3:04:28.080]  fake confessions but then oh pain compliance you can take a pro life
[3:04:28.080 --> 3:04:31.520]  for sitting on a sidewalk and break their arm with their bones sticking out
[3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:36.160]  like i show in my film marshal law and the police go to federal court and they
[3:04:36.160 --> 3:04:40.480]  say yeah pain compliance they taser people to give urine samples now

[3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:41.840]  so that eugenics can be carried out against the population
[3:08:41.840 --> 3:08:44.720]  so that is coming up but for the next 30 minutes
[3:08:44.720 --> 3:08:49.760]  we are joined by john young of cryptome.org one of the best uh it was
[3:08:49.760 --> 3:08:55.120]  it was kind of wiki leaks before wiki leaks on issues of government spying
[3:08:55.120 --> 3:08:58.160]  surveillance illegal surveillance you name it
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:01.680]  and uh they're really a clearinghouse posting and publishing a lot of this he
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:04.320]  pointed out to me in an email that he didn't even break this
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:07.920]  they just hosted the documents yahoo threatens cryptome
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:10.960]  over leak surveillance document yahoo the internet
[3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:14.560]  corporation notorious for helping china implement the totalitarian censorship
[3:09:14.560 --> 3:09:18.800]  of the web has instructed its lawyers to go after cryptome a site that functions
[3:09:18.800 --> 3:09:23.200]  as a repository for information about freedom of speech cryptography spying
[3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:27.600]  and surveillance michael t gershberg of the law firm
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:31.360]  and it goes on to send a dmc takedown order notice to john young
[3:09:31.360 --> 3:09:35.040]  cryptome webmaster on december 3rd the law firm claims that cryptome
[3:09:35.040 --> 3:09:38.640]  has violated yahoo's intellectual property rights and copyright by posting
[3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:43.360]  yahoo's compliance guide for law enforcement young has refused to remove
[3:09:43.360 --> 3:09:46.560]  the document from his website the takedown order is posted on the cryptome
[3:09:46.560 --> 3:09:50.480]  website and we've got his comments here pointing out they never
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:54.560]  registered it as copyrighted and he's being pretty sarcastic with him
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:59.040]  but it's good to have him here with us today mr young thank you for joining us
[3:09:59.040 --> 3:10:03.120]  it's a pleasure tell us just briefly about cryptome.org i mean
[3:10:03.120 --> 3:10:05.600]  a lot of my listeners are big supporters of it i've been
[3:10:05.600 --> 3:10:09.200]  learning a lot for many years from it but for those that don't know a snapshot
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:12.320]  of cryptome.org and this is only the latest
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:16.720]  persecution and and and visitation that you guys have had
[3:10:16.720 --> 3:10:19.600]  over the years so perhaps give us a little bit of background on that and
[3:10:19.600 --> 3:10:24.480]  then this latest trip into orwellville.
[3:10:24.480 --> 3:10:30.400]  Great good opportunity to speak with you Alex. We set this site up 13 years ago
[3:10:30.400 --> 3:10:34.320]  to publish information that the government didn't want the public to see
[3:10:34.320 --> 3:10:38.560]  if it's only purpose. We since expanded into
[3:10:38.560 --> 3:10:42.960]  commercial stuff but businesses don't want the public to see but most of it
[3:10:42.960 --> 3:10:45.280]  had to do with publishing government documents that
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:50.560]  they had rather the public not see so we people send us documents if they have
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:10:56.400]  access to or we get them through FOIA or they show up from unknown sources so
[3:10:56.400 --> 3:10:59.760]  we publish it without editorial remarks in
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:03.680]  most cases and let the readers decide what they think about it
[3:11:03.680 --> 3:11:07.520]  so it's more like a library than a blog and so we have about
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:11.600]  45,000 documents now on the website that have been
[3:11:11.600 --> 3:11:15.520]  collected and put up for public reading. The most recent
[3:11:15.520 --> 3:11:20.160]  series we've been putting up are telecom
[3:11:20.160 --> 3:11:24.320]  law enforcement compliance guides in which they are obliged to provide
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:28.320]  access to telecom records through the
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:32.240]  through official legislation established for this purpose.
[3:11:32.240 --> 3:11:35.520]  Most of these guides are kept private because the telecoms don't want the
[3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:39.200]  public to know that they're selling this information to the government.
[3:11:39.200 --> 3:11:43.840]  Christopher Sologion broke this story a week ago on his website. He's a
[3:11:43.840 --> 3:11:47.760]  student at Indiana University and he'd been doing research on this and
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:51.200]  asking for FOIA information and he was refused
[3:11:51.200 --> 3:11:55.760]  but he did get copies of letters from Verizon and Sprint objecting to the
[3:11:55.760 --> 3:11:58.320]  release of what they call confidential business
[3:11:58.320 --> 3:12:02.800]  information because if the public saw it they would be very upset with us.
[3:12:02.800 --> 3:12:06.640]  Well, lo and behold a day or two later someone sent us a copy
[3:12:06.640 --> 3:12:10.560]  of Yahoo's lawful compliance guide so we put it up
[3:12:10.560 --> 3:12:14.480]  and now they have thankfully verified it's authentic by saying yes
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:18.720]  that's ours just like the climate gate swindlers the top U.N. scientists all
[3:12:18.720 --> 3:12:21.120]  colluding and fraud to hide the decline in global
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:24.800]  temperatures in the last nine years they came out admitted yeah those are
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:27.920]  hard somebody stole them so it's always a nice verification.
[3:12:27.920 --> 3:12:32.800]  That's right and so along with the Yahoo's we've got about eight or nine
[3:12:32.800 --> 3:12:35.920]  others from telecom companies that have similar
[3:12:35.920 --> 3:12:40.160]  policies in place which they've never disclosed before
[3:12:40.160 --> 3:12:44.880]  and so that's now on our website and the Yahoo one is the one that's gotten the
[3:12:44.880 --> 3:12:48.480]  only response from the owners of these documents
[3:12:48.480 --> 3:12:53.360]  so they claim and sent us a standard DMCA takedown.
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:56.640]  We've gotten these DMCA takedowns several times over the years
[3:12:56.640 --> 3:13:00.720]  and have tried our best to resist them. There's a lot of fake ones too we've
[3:13:00.720 --> 3:13:03.600]  noticed most of the ones we've gone through have been fake
[3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:06.720]  we always challenge it with the federal filing and federal court
[3:13:06.720 --> 3:13:10.080]  and have beaten them but that's if they try to carry the
[3:13:10.080 --> 3:13:14.880]  the takedown order through of course that's hard to do with all of our
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:18.640]  different servers we use the CDN systems we use
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:21.760]  but i don't want to get into the architecture of how you resist those.
[3:13:21.760 --> 3:13:25.760]  John specifically with this new case let's let's start at the beginning
[3:13:25.760 --> 3:13:29.600]  what do the documents i've read over some of them what do they show
[3:13:29.600 --> 3:13:32.800]  you know the shopping list of hey warrants we don't need no stinking
[3:13:32.800 --> 3:13:36.480]  warrants it's all yours just pay us some taxpayer money we'll give them to you
[3:13:36.480 --> 3:13:40.800]  very quickly let's break that down and then and then now the latest threats
[3:13:40.800 --> 3:13:44.480]  by Yahoo and why you believe you don't have to remove it.
[3:13:44.480 --> 3:13:48.960]  Well nearly all these are the same as they they have set up policy to comply
[3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:53.440]  with the so-called CALEA requirement which is communication assistance for
[3:13:53.440 --> 3:13:57.840]  law enforcement which the law passed back in the late 90s to
[3:13:57.840 --> 3:14:01.680]  force telecom companies to comply with requests from
[3:14:01.680 --> 3:14:05.680]  law enforcement agencies so they set up policies to comply with this but also
[3:14:05.680 --> 3:14:09.120]  set up fees for providing the service it turns out
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:12.320]  there's nothing controversial about the compliance part is the fees that they
[3:14:12.320 --> 3:14:15.440]  want to keep quiet which has never been publicized because they think that's
[3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:19.600]  confidential business information so that's what they're fighting about
[3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:23.760]  is the money they're making off this well i've had the fed show up here a
[3:14:23.760 --> 3:14:28.320]  couple times and they just say just give us people's names and i go no
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:31.120]  go get a subpoena and they have subpoenas
[3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:35.680]  twice but and the and the feds are like well usually people don't make us have
[3:14:35.680 --> 3:14:39.680]  a warrant. Well one of the things that that chris
[3:14:39.680 --> 3:14:44.480]  slogan found out was that there is an in-run that can be made with internet
[3:14:44.480 --> 3:14:47.440]  information most of the type restrictions are on
[3:14:47.440 --> 3:14:51.120]  wiretap of telephones that's the that's the legacy of legislation but for
[3:14:51.120 --> 3:14:54.240]  internet that they can go around by providing
[3:14:54.240 --> 3:14:57.200]  information through loopholes in the law and that's what they've been doing and
[3:14:57.200 --> 3:15:01.040]  that's what people didn't know about it which which chris revealed
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:04.240]  and that's what these documents show they they put up a brave front of showing
[3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:07.200]  they're complying but they're in fact providing information
[3:15:07.200 --> 3:15:11.120]  that is not covered in the legislation.
[3:15:11.120 --> 3:15:15.440]  And that's their emails that's the instant messages
[3:15:15.440 --> 3:15:19.360]  and it's all itemized you know you want it yahoos got it.
[3:15:19.360 --> 3:15:24.000]  That's right and it turns out um it's a very lucrative business
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:26.960]  that's what was surprising chris found out was that how much money they're
[3:15:26.960 --> 3:15:31.520]  making off this. I saw a story last week where sprint
[3:15:31.520 --> 3:15:36.000]  got eight million law enforcement requests last year alone
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  for gps location off the cell phones which is part of the
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:45.360]  telecom act of 1996 by law October 1st 2001 all cell
[3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:49.440]  phones have to be tracked in real time off the gps triangulation from the cell
[3:15:49.440 --> 3:15:51.840]  towers down to 15 feet it's really three feet
[3:15:51.840 --> 3:15:56.000]  but the law is 15 feet and they can dial in and listen to
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:15:59.120]  what you're doing even when the cell phones off.
[3:15:59.120 --> 3:16:03.040]  So it's just a massive system and and and as insiders told me over a decade
[3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:06.480]  ago the phone companies aren't tapped by the nsa
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:10.560]  they are the nsa they have whole floors of their installations
[3:16:10.560 --> 3:16:14.160]  where everything goes through it it's like radio stations aren't
[3:16:14.160 --> 3:16:18.000]  aren't aren't run by fema fema equipment by law
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:22.560]  is wired in as the last piece of equipment that the transmission goes into
[3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:27.200]  the tower since 1996 with the emergency alert system everything
[3:16:27.200 --> 3:16:30.160]  goes through that fema control box that's controlled by
[3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:34.000]  shortwave where they can just take over all the transmissions of tv and radio
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:37.760]  with an audible signal go ahead.
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:42.560]  Yes okay so so so run through some more of what's in these
[3:16:42.560 --> 3:16:49.440]  documents and then your your eloquent challenging of this.
[3:16:49.440 --> 3:16:54.480]  Well since our site is about publicizing information about
[3:16:54.480 --> 3:16:57.280]  technological spying which we've branched into
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:01.040]  anything that deals with use of high technology to spy on people is
[3:17:01.040 --> 3:17:04.480]  is our main meat so this fits right into that and we get
[3:17:04.480 --> 3:17:08.480]  documents regularly as do other sites about this because the high technology
[3:17:08.480 --> 3:17:11.680]  stuff often is not disclosed about how effective it is
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:15.040]  whether it's through browsing or through chat rooms or through various kinds of
[3:17:15.040 --> 3:17:18.960]  things that are very popular now the facebook sites and things like that
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:22.560]  so google takes a lot of hits for this but
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:25.920]  there are dozens of other sites that are doing the same thing but all of them
[3:17:25.920 --> 3:17:30.880]  have to run through the telecom system so it's the telecoms that have the real
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:34.400]  control over all this and so these agencies go directly to the
[3:17:34.400 --> 3:17:39.680]  people who run the technology and so uh google for example couldn't do what
[3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:43.520]  it's doing without these fast interest technological infrastructure
[3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:47.200]  and so that these agencies go directly to the source of the machines where this
[3:17:47.200 --> 3:17:50.880]  is taking place and of course the specs under federal law the
[3:17:50.880 --> 3:17:55.920]  telecoms are nsa approved and designed cyber security act really expands that
[3:17:55.920 --> 3:18:00.400]  doesn't it does uh they think that uh
[3:18:00.400 --> 3:18:03.760]  there's heavy use of digital communication is a threat
[3:18:03.760 --> 3:18:08.480]  to national security um we think that's bombast
[3:18:08.480 --> 3:18:11.200]  it's really not true all the yeah they're just getting psychological
[3:18:11.200 --> 3:18:14.960]  algorithms to track and manipulate the population and protect
[3:18:14.960 --> 3:18:18.400]  their money laundering drug dealing a civil edmunds
[3:18:18.400 --> 3:18:22.720]  fbi translator whistleblower running al-qaeda up until the day of the attacks
[3:18:22.720 --> 3:18:26.400]  she's having to listen to this child kidnapping rings that's come out in
[3:18:26.400 --> 3:18:30.720]  mainstream news halibut and dinecore just the most criminal organizations
[3:18:30.720 --> 3:18:35.040]  the planet's ever seen hit teams just just the worst of the worst
[3:18:35.040 --> 3:18:39.200]  but but i'm ranting here you're now challenging this you're pointing out
[3:18:39.200 --> 3:18:42.560]  that they don't have a copyright on this and it's public interest
[3:18:42.560 --> 3:18:45.840]  but that's correct uh is that the information is in the public interest
[3:18:45.840 --> 3:18:48.320]  to see what the telecoms are doing which are
[3:18:48.320 --> 3:18:52.080]  which are public oriented organizations and they make a big deal about
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:55.920]  protecting privacy and providing service and they do not like to talk about
[3:18:55.920 --> 3:18:59.120]  selling the service covertly to government agencies
[3:18:59.120 --> 3:19:02.800]  and they're all doing it uh by the way some of them do
[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:07.360]  publish this information but not all uh and so that uh what they try to keep
[3:19:07.360 --> 3:19:10.880]  quiet is the money side of it that they're doing it is no secret but it's
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:14.720]  how much money they're making that is of interest in what they're trying to hide
[3:19:14.720 --> 3:19:19.280]  yeah i wanted to bring and so we think that needs to be known
[3:19:19.280 --> 3:19:22.560]  absolutely i wanted to bring that up to you uh earlier
[3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:26.560]  it's somewhere here in my stack i was showing the us say today
[3:19:26.560 --> 3:19:31.600]  from five years ago Missouri track scoff laws via pizza delivery database and
[3:19:31.600 --> 3:19:34.800]  then it admits nationwide all the big pizza chains
[3:19:34.800 --> 3:19:38.480]  when you call to get a pizza run your name your credit card your location
[3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:42.800]  through a criminal database and and even for small fines
[3:19:42.800 --> 3:19:47.280]  you get an arrest not a pizza and that's just an example how everything is
[3:19:47.280 --> 3:19:50.880]  being wired in to this system we're going to come back
[3:19:50.880 --> 3:19:54.400]  and discuss that with our guest uh the webmaster the head guy

[3:22:17.680 --> 3:22:20.720]  you that's not what's happening you might even pass on
[3:22:20.720 --> 3:22:24.000]  gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation

[3:24:14.800 --> 3:24:19.120]  yahoo's lawyers say you take that down now we're charging fees
[3:24:19.120 --> 3:24:24.640]  for everybody's personal information uh
[3:24:24.640 --> 3:24:29.600]  where do you go from here i mean you again eloquently explain to them that
[3:24:29.600 --> 3:24:33.280]  this is a public service that you didn't have uh you know posted this
[3:24:33.280 --> 3:24:36.560]  information where do you go from here
[3:24:37.600 --> 3:24:41.520]  as people look into this is to start asking that
[3:24:41.520 --> 3:24:46.320]  that every telecom company set up a privacy oversight board
[3:24:46.320 --> 3:24:50.160]  to look into their policies and decide what is confidential and what is uh
[3:24:50.160 --> 3:24:53.200]  for business reasons what is in the public interest so we don't have these
[3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:56.640]  gray areas of the telecom making their own
[3:24:56.640 --> 3:24:59.520]  decision without the public being involved this is good
[3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:03.360]  democratic process to oversee these giant firms
[3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:06.640]  some of them have set these up yahoo was burned a couple years ago for revealing
[3:25:06.640 --> 3:25:10.640]  information about a chinese blogger who was arrested thrown in jail
[3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:13.920]  they set up a privacy board to deal with international issues but they don't
[3:25:13.920 --> 3:25:17.600]  have a privacy board dealing with us issues so we think that's what should
[3:25:17.600 --> 3:25:20.640]  be done and that's what we proposed to yahoo as a way out of their current
[3:25:20.640 --> 3:25:23.920]  dilemma with this document we posted we have to think the public should be
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:27.600]  more involved in what corporate policy is and not have other corporate people
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:31.040]  sit on these boards who themselves may be involved in the same kind of
[3:25:31.040 --> 3:25:35.360]  activity we need disinterested impartial people looking at this
[3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:38.880]  so we think that's a good idea because privacy in the digital world
[3:25:38.880 --> 3:25:42.240]  right now is greatly at risk because every country
[3:25:42.240 --> 3:25:46.400]  that has a lot of digital infrastructure are passing laws to invade
[3:25:46.400 --> 3:25:49.920]  people's privacy more in the use of the internet and telephone systems
[3:25:49.920 --> 3:25:54.400]  well a lot of northern european countries like fennel and others brag
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:57.440]  that the government just listens to almost all the calls
[3:25:57.440 --> 3:26:01.760]  and tells the people they're doing and in google three years ago said
[3:26:01.760 --> 3:26:06.160]  we have patents for the camera and and and microphone in the computers we're
[3:26:06.160 --> 3:26:10.960]  going to listen to you in real time and and and taylor advertising for you
[3:26:10.960 --> 3:26:14.400]  i mean they're really throwing it in our face and now eric schmidt
[3:26:14.400 --> 3:26:18.240]  on cnbc said hey you shouldn't be doing anything
[3:26:18.240 --> 3:26:21.920]  you're ashamed of and you don't deserve any privacy basically have
[3:26:21.920 --> 3:26:25.440]  have you seen that video clip yet well i have and of course just like to say i
[3:26:25.440 --> 3:26:30.640]  think this is nonsense that that that this is more of the bombast put out by
[3:26:30.640 --> 3:26:34.240]  corporations to say that we have nothing to hide when in fact they do that's the
[3:26:34.240 --> 3:26:37.520]  cover story they're acting like they don't have anything to hide but they do
[3:26:37.520 --> 3:26:40.480]  have it to hide so they seem to be taking responsibility when in fact
[3:26:40.480 --> 3:26:43.520]  they're not and google is doing that and they all use
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:46.480]  the same technique in fact they're encouraged to take that technique to
[3:26:46.480 --> 3:26:50.640]  seem to be complying but they're not and now they're coming in
[3:26:50.640 --> 3:26:54.400]  with really the end of net neutrality with this internet too
[3:26:54.400 --> 3:26:57.920]  where they're going to not upgrade the older hubs force you onto their new
[3:26:57.920 --> 3:27:01.360]  systems uh microsoft's new operating systems have a
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:04.480]  thumbprint where you'll have to biometrically get on the web and
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:09.440]  register yourself uh what is krypton seeing in that area
[3:27:09.440 --> 3:27:13.920]  well it is we think that uh it's important to watch what these folks are
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:16.480]  doing you know they're extremely astute with
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:20.160]  fantastic lobbyists to shape legislation in their own direction
[3:27:20.160 --> 3:27:23.280]  that's why we think oversight of what they're doing needs to be
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:26.240]  involved the public and not leave it to government they've now got government
[3:27:26.240 --> 3:27:29.760]  eating out of their hands through lobbying firms and by campaign
[3:27:29.760 --> 3:27:33.600]  contributions we think we need impartial panels overlooking
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:37.840]  the public use of these communication services uh because they're so astute now
[3:27:37.840 --> 3:27:41.040]  that they can they can pull this film down through
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:44.160]  the government because in one of the things they do
[3:27:44.160 --> 3:27:47.600]  in fact scratching each other they give government secret services for this
[3:27:47.600 --> 3:27:51.920]  favorable treatment that's what we'd like to expose
[3:27:55.680 --> 3:27:59.280]  and there's no doubt from your research as i read the site weekly
[3:27:59.280 --> 3:28:03.040]  that just the amount of surveillance and control
[3:28:03.040 --> 3:28:07.360]  is systemic i mean it's just everything's being surveilled
[3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:12.080]  everything's being recorded and government has gone from saying oh we're
[3:28:12.080 --> 3:28:15.200]  not engaged in warrantless wiretaps to being caught
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:19.440]  lying to just wide open yeah we're listening to everything
[3:28:19.440 --> 3:28:24.080]  get used to it well one of the techniques that they've evolved is that
[3:28:24.080 --> 3:28:28.640]  since we have a right to get access to government information through FOIA to
[3:28:28.640 --> 3:28:32.160]  some extent they now use this thing called confidential business
[3:28:32.160 --> 3:28:34.720]  information to withhold information about the contractors
[3:28:34.720 --> 3:28:38.240]  to government who are running most of these systems government does not run
[3:28:38.240 --> 3:28:41.680]  these systems corporations do and they use this term confidential
[3:28:41.680 --> 3:28:44.960]  business information to withhold information and that's allowed under
[3:28:44.960 --> 3:28:48.400]  the law that's what chris solokian smoked out is
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:51.120]  that they were hiding this data using this hack term
[3:28:51.120 --> 3:28:54.560]  confidential business information now that was legislated to protect
[3:28:54.560 --> 3:28:58.320]  government's complicity and government's fine
[3:28:58.320 --> 3:29:01.920]  and that's the back scratching that's going on
[3:29:01.920 --> 3:29:06.160]  so they they spy for commercial purposes but then they sell
[3:29:06.160 --> 3:29:09.840]  governmental spying to the government and using the same technology the same
[3:29:09.840 --> 3:29:13.040]  systems and that's the back scratching that's going on now people who work
[3:29:13.040 --> 3:29:16.400]  for these companies are the ones who who tell us about this
[3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:19.840]  we don't work there but the people inside are who are running these systems
[3:29:19.840 --> 3:29:23.520]  are very disturbed by this duplicity and google is the
[3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:27.040]  giant among these people microsoft is another
[3:29:27.040 --> 3:29:30.080]  these great server forums that are around the beat set up around the world
[3:29:30.080 --> 3:29:34.560]  now vast vacuums of everything is passing through nearly all
[3:29:34.560 --> 3:29:38.320]  communication systems and when the san antonio
[3:29:38.320 --> 3:29:42.000]  media tries to go to the new nsa base and just ask questions the police come
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:46.400]  out and threaten to arrest them well i appreciate uh what cryptome.org

[3:33:16.880 --> 3:33:22.240]  you're gonna beat this yahoo uh situation i'm sure plus they're coming
[3:33:22.240 --> 3:33:24.320]  after you will only make everybody go get the
[3:33:24.320 --> 3:33:27.040]  documents mirror it in thousands of places
[3:33:27.040 --> 3:33:30.320]  i mean can they really do anything legally i guess they can sue you
[3:33:30.320 --> 3:33:33.440]  but then that'll just bring more attention to their profiting from big
[3:33:33.440 --> 3:33:36.880]  brother yeah and what they try to do is bluff
[3:33:36.880 --> 3:33:39.920]  and intimidate people the electronic frontier
[3:33:39.920 --> 3:33:44.400]  foundation has a very large collection of documents where they faked
[3:33:44.400 --> 3:33:47.680]  claims of copyright to bamboozle people who don't know the law
[3:33:47.680 --> 3:33:51.360]  and if anyone cares about this they should go to the EFF site
[3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:54.320]  to read about it so we think they're bluffing here uh
[3:33:54.320 --> 3:33:57.600]  nonetheless they can sue the large corporation fine

[3:34:18.880 --> 3:34:23.600]  EFF electronic frontier foundation that's correct

[3:34:31.280 --> 3:34:34.960]  you bet thank you okay uh let me briefly hit health care that i'm going to get
[3:34:34.960 --> 3:34:39.200]  into the latest on the carbon scam and the world government
[3:34:39.200 --> 3:34:44.560]  meeting that is happening right now in Copenhagen Denmark
[3:34:44.560 --> 3:34:51.520]  first off on health care this is so ridiculous
[3:34:51.520 --> 3:34:58.000]  in fact pull up the newsweek cover the case for killing granny
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:01.760]  and then if you can pull up that abc news article where they're teaching kids to
[3:35:01.760 --> 3:35:05.440]  commit suicide by 11 because their carbon footprint
[3:35:05.440 --> 3:35:09.120]  runs out at that time i want to have those ready
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:13.200]  uh whenever i get into what's really behind the carbon tax
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:18.480]  from their own words from their own statements i want people to hear this
[3:35:18.480 --> 3:35:24.000]  but before i hit the health care issue on on on the issue of schmitt at google
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:27.600]  saying you know none of our stuff really should be private and so what
[3:35:27.600 --> 3:35:30.480]  you know don't think it's private don't have anything to hide what do you have
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:34.240]  to hide meanwhile you can't find where the google CEOs and
[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:37.360]  other top executives live they block that out of their system
[3:35:37.360 --> 3:35:43.760]  here is ap today promises promises a closed meeting on openness
[3:35:43.760 --> 3:35:46.320]  it's hardly the image of transparency the obama
[3:35:46.320 --> 3:35:50.080]  administration wants to project a workshop on government openness is closed
[3:35:50.080 --> 3:35:53.120]  to the public and then it goes into how they're one of the most
[3:35:53.120 --> 3:35:57.280]  secretive administration since nixon and he makes it secret who goes to the
[3:35:57.280 --> 3:36:02.800]  white house and everything else it's just incredible
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:10.080]  so there is some of the news uh on that front okay on health care
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:14.400]  there it is the case for killing granting and literally i take newsweek
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:19.280]  every issue has an article about how great euthanasia is or how good it is
[3:36:19.280 --> 3:36:23.200]  that people committed suicide you know is it good well it is loving
[3:36:23.200 --> 3:36:27.280]  his wife was sick so he went ahead and killed himself too
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:31.360]  and tom dashill wrote a book and he's the wrote the original health care bill
[3:36:31.360 --> 3:36:35.040]  saying above 60 you don't get eye surgery that's for young people
[3:36:35.040 --> 3:36:39.680]  teaching you the pie is only so big and if you're going to get ahead as a young
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:42.240]  yuppie you've got to be forgetting rid of this aging
[3:36:42.240 --> 3:36:47.040]  population and in the bill it says 2.5 to 5 percent
[3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:49.440]  of your check will be taken for the new health care and
[3:36:49.440 --> 3:36:52.800]  quarter million dollar fines five years in prison
[3:36:52.800 --> 3:36:56.400]  if you don't get the insurance that's in the bill and
[3:36:56.400 --> 3:37:03.360]  they've got tens of billions a year cuts in medicaid uh 41 billion dollar a
[3:37:03.360 --> 3:37:09.200]  year cut in medicare and that's conservative
[3:37:09.200 --> 3:37:13.280]  and i get emails saying you're an evil republican when i'm not a republican
[3:37:13.280 --> 3:37:16.880]  or democrat you work for the insurance companies
[3:37:16.880 --> 3:37:20.640]  every day and we get phone calls on air sometime i mean you've heard it you see
[3:37:20.640 --> 3:37:24.240]  it when it was in wall street journal a few weeks
[3:37:24.240 --> 3:37:27.280]  ago and it that the health care industry
[3:37:27.280 --> 3:37:29.600]  and their top lobbyists for the insurance companies
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:32.640]  we're going to pull out of support of the health care bill three weeks ago
[3:37:32.640 --> 3:37:36.880]  because obama under pressure from democrats wasn't going to make the cuts
[3:37:36.880 --> 3:37:40.480]  and wasn't going to force you to get insurance deniz kasinich who i don't
[3:37:40.480 --> 3:37:42.640]  agree with politically on a lot of issues but at least
[3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:47.120]  he's honest i respect him is a admitted socialist
[3:37:47.120 --> 3:37:51.120]  and he wrote an article titled you can pull this up
[3:37:51.120 --> 3:37:54.960]  on his own congressional website health care
[3:37:54.960 --> 3:38:02.960]  plan is a bailout for insurance companies and it is they wrote it
[3:38:02.960 --> 3:38:06.800]  just like dutch roll shell and it's in the emails
[3:38:06.800 --> 3:38:13.280]  and bp and xon mobile are on record pushing the global climate tax
[3:38:13.280 --> 3:38:16.960]  and then people say oh you work for the oil companies because you're against the
[3:38:16.960 --> 3:38:20.160]  tax that's like the fellow reserve in newspapers they
[3:38:20.160 --> 3:38:24.800]  controlled or owned ran articles by the banks sponsored by them
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:30.240]  saying we don't want the fellow reserve act in 1913 when it was for them
[3:38:30.240 --> 3:38:33.520]  that's a simple trick there's so many tricks they use
[3:38:33.520 --> 3:38:36.880]  the insurance companies write the health care bill
[3:38:36.880 --> 3:38:40.320]  has a new tax to them there's like insurance companies lobby that you
[3:38:40.320 --> 3:38:44.160]  should have to get more and more car insurance
[3:38:44.160 --> 3:38:48.080]  but i wanted to go over that shell cap and trade is a good thing
[3:38:48.080 --> 3:38:51.040]  you know i've got all these other articles
[3:38:51.040 --> 3:38:54.000]  where they're all behind it and now it's come out in the
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:58.080]  hacked emails from the east anglia university the head un
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:03.440]  climate facility so this is what they're doing
[3:39:03.440 --> 3:39:07.200]  now here is the article from newsweek the case for killing granny
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:12.240]  here's another one abc website tells kids when they should die that's
[3:39:12.240 --> 3:39:15.440]  info wars has a link to the article where you can read it in the news of
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:19.200]  australia and blow up that image they tell the kids that
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:23.040]  little animals are dying and and and and that their carbon
[3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:27.280]  credits run out at age 11 so you should you should basically kill
[3:39:27.280 --> 3:39:30.480]  yourself that you're not supposed to live past age 11
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:36.640]  i mean this is the level of the eugenicist this is what is behind all
[3:39:36.640 --> 3:39:41.280]  of this i've done the research i made the film in game blueprint for global
[3:39:41.280 --> 3:39:45.520]  enslavement the rockefeller endowment the carnegie endowment
[3:39:45.520 --> 3:39:50.800]  the ibm started as a eugenics front hitler supporting all these groups
[3:39:50.800 --> 3:39:56.560]  hitler learned everything from the british in the us
[3:39:56.560 --> 3:40:00.720]  it's just that he only wanted to kill certain races the globalists say no no
[3:40:00.720 --> 3:40:06.000]  no no we're going to kill 80 of the world population
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:09.760]  that's what in game blueprint for global enslavement covers in fact i had you
[3:40:09.760 --> 3:40:12.880]  guys print me morris strong quotes i mean
[3:40:12.880 --> 3:40:19.280]  my only problem is i have too much too much evidence
[3:40:19.280 --> 3:40:26.080]  uh of all of this information too much information to even be able
[3:40:26.080 --> 3:40:30.640]  to keep track of this anymore will you ask erin to print me
[3:40:30.640 --> 3:40:34.480]  that info wars list of morris strong quotes again
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:37.680]  ask him to print me that immediately i mean there's just so much you know what
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:41.680]  i'm going to do i i am just going to and highlight them again thank you
[3:40:41.680 --> 3:40:44.320]  oh no here it is i found it i found it it's over here
[3:40:44.320 --> 3:40:49.280]  let me just read to you and of course don't believe us when we when we post
[3:40:49.280 --> 3:40:54.400]  this you know when i read in
[3:40:54.400 --> 3:40:58.640]  bullet surprise winning you know publications in books in one particular
[3:40:58.640 --> 3:41:02.000]  one about ibm and margaret sanger i didn't believe them
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  i send off to the university archives and got the letters where she said
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:10.800]  we've got to exterminate these black weeds how do we kill these blacks how do
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:15.600]  we sterilize them how do we kill them you know nine out of
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:20.160]  it's just unbelievable more black babies are aborted every year than are born
[3:41:20.160 --> 3:41:23.760]  but it's liberal and loving see margaret sanger being thanked by hitler and
[3:41:23.760 --> 3:41:26.320]  speeches and she's still woman of the year
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:31.360]  and one of the most important women of the century in time magazine
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:37.520]  now this is morris strong founder of the unenvironment program 1992 uh at rio
[3:41:37.520 --> 3:41:42.160]  dejanero speaking it's isn't the only hope for
[3:41:42.160 --> 3:41:45.040]  the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse
[3:41:45.040 --> 3:41:48.720]  isn't it our responsibility to bring that about morris strong founder of the
[3:41:48.720 --> 3:41:53.040]  unenvironment program what did the co-author of this book
[3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:57.040]  one of the previous science advisors to george bush senior
[3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:02.640]  and best buddies who's co-written five books with john p holdren
[3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:06.320]  eco science talking about sterilizing you
[3:42:06.320 --> 3:42:11.440]  what did paul urlick professor of population studies say
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:15.680]  a massive campaign must be launched to de-develop the united states de-develop
[3:42:15.680 --> 3:42:19.040]  it means bringing our economic system into line with the realities of
[3:42:19.040 --> 3:42:24.320]  ecology and world resource situation and they go on in these documents to say
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:28.160]  we're going to do this by taxing carbon and we're going to tell people that
[3:42:28.160 --> 3:42:31.040]  carbon dioxide is bad what did the epa announced
[3:42:31.040 --> 3:42:34.080]  today they're going to list it as a toxic waste
[3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:37.440]  in line with the kopenhagen initiative the global government treaty
[3:42:37.440 --> 3:42:41.680]  which the head of the un and the head of the euro the european union state
[3:42:41.680 --> 3:42:47.520]  is the control system for neo feudalistic world government
[3:42:47.520 --> 3:42:52.000]  professor parle urlick stanford university given society's cheap abundant
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:57.360]  energy would be the equivalent of giving an idiot child a machine gun
[3:42:57.360 --> 3:43:01.440]  dav foreman co-founder of earth first the three main goals must be to reduce
[3:43:01.440 --> 3:43:04.240]  human population to about 100 million worldwide
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:07.760]  destroy the industrial infrastructure and the wilderness
[3:43:07.760 --> 3:43:11.440]  with its full component of species returning throughout the world
[3:43:11.440 --> 3:43:15.200]  and i can go on for hours reading you these quotes i mean ted turner
[3:43:15.200 --> 3:43:19.280]  a total population of 250 300 million people and 95 percent
[3:43:19.280 --> 3:43:25.520]  from present levels would be ideal that was on cnn he said that
[3:43:25.520 --> 3:43:28.960]  and then of course you read the human genome project
[3:43:28.960 --> 3:43:32.720]  caught red-handed developing cancer viruses that they then add to the
[3:43:32.720 --> 3:43:37.120]  vaccines caught red-handed i mean these people are so
[3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:41.520]  devastatingly evil and and and they're just frothing
[3:43:41.520 --> 3:43:45.200]  bill melinda gates foundation bill gates's dad former head of plant parenthood
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:48.320]  bill gates bill moyer is talking about population reduction
[3:43:48.320 --> 3:43:52.880]  these people mean devastating business
[3:43:52.880 --> 3:43:56.560]  and all these fool yuppies i talked to him
[3:43:56.560 --> 3:44:00.640]  and they say well anybody making over 200 300 000 a year especially in any
[3:44:00.640 --> 3:44:04.640]  elite city like austin new york la you know my dad's a
[3:44:04.640 --> 3:44:07.920]  dentist and he's been invited to some elite meetings with some pretty big
[3:44:07.920 --> 3:44:11.200]  people dinners and they won't go to them
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:14.080]  because they're both they're giving them the books they wrote about world
[3:44:14.080 --> 3:44:16.880]  population reduction and talking about how they want to kill
[3:44:16.880 --> 3:44:20.480]  everyone my dad uh who was in in high school
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:24.560]  one of the top of his class they sent him to a ut advanced project when he was a
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:28.800]  junior and senior they called him in to these meetings
[3:44:28.800 --> 3:44:32.320]  out of the 125 they selected he was in the top six smartest
[3:44:32.320 --> 3:44:38.480]  and and professor spear called him in and said you need to be involved in
[3:44:38.480 --> 3:44:41.280]  government we need to be involved in eugenics
[3:44:41.280 --> 3:44:45.520]  he spear said i'm jewish hitler had it wrong wanting to only get rid of certain
[3:44:45.520 --> 3:44:49.520]  groups it's actually all the bad people i mean this isn't me reading government
[3:44:49.520 --> 3:44:52.880]  documents my dad can't go to cocktail parties
[3:44:52.880 --> 3:44:57.120]  with rich people without having to hear about it it's all you hear and you talk
[3:44:57.120 --> 3:45:00.560]  to these stupid yuppies and they go oh there are too many people
[3:45:00.560 --> 3:45:04.640]  we need to get rid of people it's kind of like thrilled a little power trip
[3:45:04.640 --> 3:45:07.520]  uh view of the world it makes them feel important
[3:45:07.520 --> 3:45:11.440]  you know pressing on the nerve of power don't you idiots know
[3:45:11.440 --> 3:45:15.920]  you're being targeted as well eugenics isn't what you're taught in school of positive
[3:45:15.920 --> 3:45:19.600]  and negative advancing the healthier smarter specimens
[3:45:19.600 --> 3:45:25.440]  culling the dumb ones which is bad enough it actually the next tier of eugenics
[3:45:25.440 --> 3:45:29.120]  when you deeply read is targeting the intelligence groups
[3:45:29.120 --> 3:45:34.400]  it's targeting the wild suns the bad suns as they call them the people that
[3:45:34.400 --> 3:45:39.040]  the middle class wild seed they call it that has the genetic complement to
[3:45:39.040 --> 3:45:42.400]  challenge the elite i mean these people are sick
[3:45:42.400 --> 3:45:46.000]  they're putting cancer viruses they've been caught that the un's been caught
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:49.280]  adding hormones to tetanus shots to sterilize women
[3:45:49.280 --> 3:45:56.880]  i mean the sv 40 human uh you know papilloma viruses all of
[3:45:56.880 --> 3:46:01.520]  this they've been caught the sock vaccine knowingly it was in there
[3:46:01.520 --> 3:46:05.120]  we have videos of sock and others bragging and laughing about it i mean
[3:46:05.120 --> 3:46:09.040]  this is so evil and you've got all these fools that think
[3:46:09.040 --> 3:46:12.560]  they're part of the power structure and who think this is all cute and funny
[3:46:12.560 --> 3:46:16.160]  and they've been let in on the inside track and
[3:46:16.160 --> 3:46:22.320]  they've been let in on the big secret and it's so much fun
[3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:26.240]  so at this united nations climate change conference we've gone over the 200 page
[3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:29.440]  treaty here global governance world government
[3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:35.600]  queue up von rompe again for everybody they say that this will be a planetary
[3:46:35.600 --> 3:46:38.800]  government first targeting the western nations
[3:46:38.800 --> 3:46:45.440]  that already have 1.2 child replacement the the the the the western nations
[3:46:45.440 --> 3:46:49.360]  on average have 1.3 children for every two people 1.3
[3:46:49.360 --> 3:46:52.880]  japan's dying italy's dying germany's dying
[3:46:52.880 --> 3:46:58.800]  the united states is dying all the original western populations are dying
[3:46:58.800 --> 3:47:03.360]  they're dying all the major populations are dying
[3:47:03.360 --> 3:47:06.320]  and that's exactly what the globalists want that's the first group they want
[3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:09.200]  wiped out but they're also running soft kill operations on
[3:47:09.200 --> 3:47:13.120]  africans latin americans uh pacific islanders everybody
[3:47:13.120 --> 3:47:16.480]  and they've been caught i mean just document after document after document
[3:47:16.480 --> 3:47:18.960]  after document that we cover in my film in game
[3:47:18.960 --> 3:47:22.560]  where they just admit they're doing this to everyone
[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:26.480]  and then now here's the new york times epa sets carbon crack down
[3:47:26.480 --> 3:47:29.520]  they're going to tax carbon dioxide everything listing it
[3:47:29.520 --> 3:47:36.320]  as a toxic waste abc news abc news right here
[3:47:36.320 --> 3:47:44.000]  epa greenhouse gasses in danger human health
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:47.520]  and they list all the other gases like methane that cows
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:51.520]  have flatulence new zealand and places have already passed laws canada's passing
[3:47:51.520 --> 3:47:56.560]  laws uh to tax uh any type of of animal that releases
[3:47:56.560 --> 3:48:02.000]  methane sheet cows chickens goats everything geese
[3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:04.960]  swartzenegger couldn't get the legislature to pass it so he just said
[3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:09.440]  i'm banning tv's above 40 inches and putting taxes on all others
[3:48:09.440 --> 3:48:14.000]  total feudalism total serfdom is now unfolding
[3:48:14.000 --> 3:48:20.480]  and all of this being done in line obama administration will formally declare
[3:48:20.480 --> 3:48:24.480]  danger of carbon emissions including carbon dioxide to be listed
[3:48:24.480 --> 3:48:31.440]  as a toxic waste and it only takes the majority to create
[3:48:31.440 --> 3:48:36.160]  the treaty and obama's going to sign on you watch
[3:48:37.360 --> 3:48:41.520]  but then even if they don't ratify it in the senate the states through federal
[3:48:41.520 --> 3:48:45.440]  bureaucracy which is under unesco that bush signed us back on to united
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:49.120]  nations educational cultural organization they are integrating this
[3:48:49.120 --> 3:48:54.240]  everywhere at the state level last week the internal un documents came out
[3:48:54.240 --> 3:48:57.200]  cnn ap they all covered it like it was a good thing
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:49:01.280]  and said oh yes the un has a global program in all the public schools
[3:49:01.280 --> 3:49:05.120]  with grade children teaching them to educate their parents to rebuke their
[3:49:05.120 --> 3:49:08.640]  parents new york times describe kids telling their parents writing them
[3:49:08.640 --> 3:49:12.480]  fake tickets about taking hot baths next they can have them
[3:49:12.480 --> 3:49:14.880]  spawn for terrorism they're already doing that
[3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:18.480]  they're recruiting the boy scouts the girl scouts for homeland security i mean
[3:49:18.480 --> 3:49:22.400]  this is just orwell on steroids
[3:49:22.800 --> 3:49:29.040]  i just can't believe it and it just goes on and on and on and on and on
[3:49:29.040 --> 3:49:34.000]  and the good news is though these emails got hacked they got released to the
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:37.360]  media six weeks ago the media wouldn't cover it so they got then released to
[3:49:37.360 --> 3:49:40.240]  universities and it's them and they're admitting oh my
[3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:43.360]  gosh the earth's getting cooler we've got to hide this we've got to hide the
[3:49:43.360 --> 3:49:46.560]  decline we've got to persecute scientists we've got to get them fired we've
[3:49:46.560 --> 3:49:49.600]  got to keep them from from getting their papers published we've got to keep this
[3:49:49.600 --> 3:49:53.440]  out of the ipcc report we've got to get with the
[3:49:53.440 --> 3:49:56.720]  government to block these four-year requests the government is helping us
[3:49:56.720 --> 3:50:00.560]  block people from getting this oh we've got to work with goddard space center
[3:50:00.560 --> 3:50:04.080]  we've got to work with the un to hide it the head three head climate
[3:50:04.080 --> 3:50:08.320]  facilities in england the united states and germany
[3:50:08.320 --> 3:50:12.720]  all working together the three that they draw from and then you see the un say
[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:17.040]  yes this has been very damaging to our program
[3:50:17.040 --> 3:50:21.200]  these emails coming out but thank god that we still have the peer reviewed
[3:50:21.200 --> 3:50:25.120]  journals that prove global warming is real
[3:50:25.280 --> 3:50:29.760]  when the very peer reviewed journals are using the data from the un climate
[3:50:29.760 --> 3:50:34.880]  index that they that they integrated that they created
[3:50:34.880 --> 3:50:38.320]  but the good news is i've got an article here with the head of the un saying
[3:50:38.320 --> 3:50:42.160]  this has been devastating to them and so the good news is this
[3:50:42.160 --> 3:50:46.160]  pseudo science this fraud is being exposed
[3:50:46.160 --> 3:50:49.360]  and we spend an hour in my new two-plus hour film
[3:50:49.360 --> 3:50:53.520]  fall of the republic exposing this it's free on youtube free on google just
[3:50:53.520 --> 3:50:56.560]  google it email it to everybody you know get the dvd
[3:50:56.560 --> 3:51:01.360]  at info wars dot com make copies expose the scum
[3:51:01.360 --> 3:51:04.560]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[3:51:04.560 --> 3:51:08.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[3:51:08.640 --> 3:51:11.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[3:51:11.120 --> 3:51:14.960]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:51:14.960 --> 3:51:18.160]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[3:51:18.160 --> 3:51:21.600]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[3:51:21.600 --> 3:51:25.360]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[3:51:25.360 --> 3:51:28.320]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[3:51:28.320 --> 3:51:32.160]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[3:51:32.160 --> 3:51:35.520]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[3:51:35.520 --> 3:51:39.280]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[3:51:39.280 --> 3:51:42.160]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[3:51:42.160 --> 3:51:45.200]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[3:51:45.200 --> 3:51:47.920]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more
[3:51:47.920 --> 3:51:53.200]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[3:51:53.200 --> 3:51:57.280]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[3:51:57.280 --> 3:52:02.640]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[3:52:02.640 --> 3:52:06.640]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[3:52:06.640 --> 3:52:09.840]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[3:52:09.840 --> 3:52:13.840]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[3:52:13.840 --> 3:52:17.040]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[3:52:17.040 --> 3:52:21.040]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[3:52:21.040 --> 3:52:26.320]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[3:52:26.320 --> 3:52:29.520]  fall the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[3:52:29.520 --> 3:52:33.920]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[3:52:33.920 --> 3:52:37.200]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:40.960]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[3:52:40.960 --> 3:52:44.800]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
