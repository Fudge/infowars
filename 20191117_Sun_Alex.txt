[00:00.000 --> 00:18.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.320 --> 00:29.920]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones and we are live on this sunday
[00:29.920 --> 00:39.600]  november 17th 2019 worldwide broadcast hard to believe we've only got a month and a half left
[00:39.600 --> 00:47.840]  until we are already in the year 2020 what an epic number what an epic political geopolitical
[00:47.840 --> 00:54.000]  atmosphere we are all witnessing thank you again for joining us on this sunday evening
[00:54.640 --> 00:58.800]  now there's a lot of distractions and diversions and a lot of entertainment out there but
[00:58.800 --> 01:05.520]  there's nothing more engaging and interesting than reality and the animated contest for liberty
[01:05.520 --> 01:10.880]  and the attempt and the ability to even control a small part of our own destinies
[01:10.880 --> 01:19.280]  this is a particularly big news night but i think it's really important to preface the
[01:19.280 --> 01:28.080]  broadcast with this doesn't the world want to know what makes the powerful billionaires tech
[01:29.440 --> 01:34.880]  don't you want to know about who runs the global government and what their plans are for you and
[01:34.880 --> 01:42.320]  your family what's their cosmology what's their worldview what makes them tech and if you know
[01:42.320 --> 01:47.840]  the answer to that well you know the answer to everything that's something they don't want you
[01:47.840 --> 01:54.480]  to even discuss or look at but it's our mission to actually dig into who those people are
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.840]  turns out the most powerful consortium of parallel governments what
[01:59.840 --> 02:07.600]  what the group called it 13 14 years ago when they did a pr push they called it a parallel
[02:07.600 --> 02:14.800]  world government how's bill gates called it that and they were meeting in secret locations in new
[02:14.800 --> 02:22.240]  york and locations in new mexico and locations in the caribbean and they were training larger
[02:22.240 --> 02:28.560]  groups outside of the central cult from there of course you know that cult and it's made or d
[02:28.560 --> 02:40.160]  it's master of ceremonies it's a hotel manager as jeffrey apstein and of course then his girlfriend
[02:40.160 --> 02:46.240]  whose father had formerly run that job for british intelligence and israeli intelligence
[02:47.120 --> 02:52.800]  as well and that's all come out the news now you know i told you about it more than a decade ago
[02:52.800 --> 02:58.560]  but epstein was only one player in the larger house of cards that is coming down and now we see
[02:59.360 --> 03:05.520]  prince andrew the duke of york caught up in the spiderweb that's all limited hang out we're going
[03:05.520 --> 03:09.840]  to be walking through that here tonight i'll see you today getting ready for the broadcast
[03:10.800 --> 03:14.880]  a few hours ago what do i really want to do here on air is i want to tell you about
[03:15.840 --> 03:22.640]  what's coming again in 10 15 20 years instead of just pointing out all the things i was dead on
[03:22.640 --> 03:27.920]  about why don't we get into more and more here on the show what's coming next because that's
[03:27.920 --> 03:34.160]  really what everybody wants to know and you know i do know what's coming next if we let the globalists
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.880]  run everything and don't get involved i know exactly the destination they're taking us to
[03:38.880 --> 03:44.640]  because they've been quite honest about all that but you see there's not just evil in the universe
[03:44.640 --> 03:51.600]  and if we get informed and involved and engaged then they're not going to have the capability
[03:51.600 --> 03:57.680]  despite all the money in the world all the tea in china all the pros act they want to push on the
[03:57.680 --> 04:04.080]  public to get us to acquiesce to their attempt to control the future and have what they call the
[04:04.080 --> 04:11.200]  end of future so we're laying it all out today and we're just going to start from there moving
[04:11.200 --> 04:15.440]  forward we have two special guests joining us in the second hour i'll tell you about that
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.000]  when we come back as well but start your engines because i'm going to be a good boy
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.280]  and i'm going to cover everything you know i haven't had a feeling like this since about
[04:25.280 --> 04:35.760]  27 years ago when i basically had this total over driving uh hunger and and compulsion to
[04:35.760 --> 04:41.600]  fight the globalist and really had a vision of what would come and now i just the last few weeks
[04:41.600 --> 04:47.200]  have been been going through that same process but even stronger for now the new work that is about
[04:47.200 --> 04:53.120]  to begin yes the enemy failed to take us off air but soon info wars won't even matter because the
[04:53.120 --> 05:03.520]  next great creation is about to stand forth stay with us info wars life has done it again
[05:03.520 --> 05:12.080]  with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet super silver whitening toothpaste this is proprietary
[05:12.080 --> 05:18.000]  this is with the top lab in the country and it is incredibly high quality this is the best
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.120]  toothpaste you're going to find it's called whitening toothpaste but really it knocks out the
[05:23.120 --> 05:30.000]  bacteria it recalcifies the teeth it does so many things on so many fronts these beautiful tubes of
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.680]  super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25 percent off out of the
[05:35.680 --> 05:41.600]  gates it's as low as we can go and they're going to sell out very very quickly super silver whitening
[05:41.600 --> 05:47.120]  toothpaste is going to be a hit i'm very very proud of it i want to thank my father a retired
[05:47.120 --> 05:52.640]  dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it it's 25 off out of the gates
[05:52.640 --> 06:08.800]  that's as low as we can go because it's very very expensive to produce get yours today at info wars
[06:08.800 --> 06:11.600]  life dot com and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say i don't know what's
[06:11.600 --> 06:16.400]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one
[06:16.400 --> 06:23.760]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[06:29.760 --> 06:35.360]  it is sunday november 17th 2019 i am your host alex jones
[06:37.520 --> 06:42.640]  all right let me do when i do it quite often here at the start of the broadcast attempt to just
[06:42.640 --> 06:47.520]  tell you what's on the plate here and what i hope we get to but a lot of this we probably won't get
[06:47.520 --> 06:53.440]  to all of it it'll be on info wars dot com news wars dot com and of course band dot video what a
[06:53.440 --> 07:00.240]  critical destination to visit and to paul revere out to everyone you know um let's just start with
[07:00.240 --> 07:06.960]  what i'm going to end the broadcast with but i will get to it the smart city ecosystem framework a
[07:06.960 --> 07:14.480]  model for planning smart cities google tells us all about it and then it ties to this fears of 5g
[07:14.480 --> 07:21.520]  weapon system in uk after conspiracy theorist takes apart a light and shows people secret 5g but
[07:21.520 --> 07:29.280]  still he's the bad person that i thought i'd show you the first known article exposing the 5g by name
[07:29.280 --> 07:37.360]  nine years ago new streetlights to have homeland security applications info wars dot com paul
[07:37.360 --> 07:45.280]  joseph watson and i and paul wrote that article back there nine years ago and now smart streetlights
[07:45.280 --> 07:51.200]  to track everything we do all the time that's six years ago and now a few years later the sci-fi
[07:51.200 --> 07:58.400]  future of lamp post remember when drudge linked to paul's article nine years ago the media came
[07:58.400 --> 08:08.000]  out and said it wasn't true we had made it up just like i made it up that jeffrey ebbstein was working
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.400]  for international intelligence agencies blackmailing thousands of government and scientific chiefs
[08:14.400 --> 08:22.400]  now it's all public we know who the players are we know how they operate and as soon as you know
[08:22.400 --> 08:28.400]  the real playbook everything's crystal clear if you're off here in fantasy land mainline republican
[08:28.400 --> 08:34.400]  democrat politics nothing makes sense because it's all meant to keep people all tied knots it's all
[08:34.400 --> 08:40.400]  distraction airing the only question is who's really running the planet there is a corporate
[08:40.400 --> 08:48.400]  world government and what is their plan for everyone and when you find that out you realize
[08:48.400 --> 08:54.400]  you're living in a science fiction dystopic film beyond any hollywood movie and you really get
[08:54.400 --> 09:02.400]  frustrated because it's so easy to beat these individuals if the average man who was successful
[09:02.400 --> 09:08.400]  didn't think that they were successful by keeping their head down so that's coming up and then
[09:08.400 --> 09:18.400]  solutions to countering this dehumanization forest bathing and outdoor therapy and wilderness
[09:18.400 --> 09:24.400]  therapy we're going to get all that big wall street journal article when the u.s. tried to control
[09:24.400 --> 09:30.400]  hurricanes and it talks about ben levingston that led the secret program but they did control
[09:30.400 --> 09:36.400]  hurricanes the u.s. government certified at the u.s. navy in 1967 but just everything we told
[09:36.400 --> 09:42.400]  you right there in the wall street journal out of you livingston back in 2004 he was 90 years
[09:42.400 --> 09:48.400]  old then still ran a major weather control company when the u.s. tried to control hurricanes
[09:48.400 --> 09:54.400]  you'll be getting into all of that meanwhile Chinese soldiers are seen on streets of Hong Kong
[09:54.400 --> 09:58.400]  for the first time they've been there in plain clothes but now the tanks officially rolled in
[09:58.400 --> 10:04.400]  meanwhile Chinese killer robots sold to Middle East will leave every human dead
[10:04.400 --> 10:10.400]  five takeaways from the leaked files of China's mass detention of Muslims and MSNBC pretty much
[10:10.400 --> 10:16.400]  defends it in that set Hong Kong braces for disruption and violence report China still
[10:16.400 --> 10:23.400]  harvesting organs for political dissidents DARPA seeks militarized microbes DARPA says for the
[10:23.400 --> 10:30.400]  first time really weaponized microbes that's brand new okay
[10:30.400 --> 10:36.400]  as if they say it's new it doesn't fall into the old biological weapons conventions because
[10:36.400 --> 10:42.400]  they're not really what you'd call bacterium or micro plasms they're what you call viral
[10:42.400 --> 10:49.400]  which is only information they argue a virus is alive or dead is RNA alive or dead versus
[10:49.400 --> 10:56.400]  DNA and so the answer is because this is nanotech engineered microbes they say it's around
[10:56.400 --> 11:01.400]  the biological weapons and chemical weapons treaties when of course it doesn't it's like a
[11:01.400 --> 11:08.400]  lot of stuff you hear is vaccines oh it's a vaccine and then it's actual nanotech artificial
[11:08.400 --> 11:14.400]  viruses that have been created that replicates and each part of the brain oh but you'll never
[11:14.400 --> 11:19.400]  want to smoke a cigarette again don't worry because those receptors are all gone those
[11:19.400 --> 11:26.400]  receptors are there for a reason the nicotine and opium and then all those different drugs
[11:26.400 --> 11:30.400]  just manipulates receptors that are there for a reason and that's how this is all interconnected
[11:30.400 --> 11:36.400]  we're going to get to that and we've also got all of these giant stacks of news we have
[11:36.400 --> 11:41.400]  Robert Barnes really smart constitutional lawyer who warned Roger Stone about the railroad
[11:41.400 --> 11:47.400]  and he's coming on Tyler Nixon Stone's personal lawyers we popping in next hour for several
[11:47.400 --> 11:54.400]  segments the last segment I'll get into the secret 5g and 6g going in all of the world
[11:54.400 --> 12:00.400]  that we first told you about almost nine years ago and show you the proof of that like we
[12:00.400 --> 12:06.400]  were the first to show Google listening and watching to you in 2004 secretly oh and it's
[12:06.400 --> 12:13.400]  in the news today that it's on info wars dot com from their own press release that no one's
[12:13.400 --> 12:17.400]  covering that Facebook controls your phone even if you don't have Facebook downloaded
[12:17.400 --> 12:24.400]  on it and it's secretly videoing you will explain why they're throwing at your face
[12:24.400 --> 12:28.400]  why they're telling you that but I'm having trouble finding that in my stack we just print
[12:28.400 --> 12:33.400]  that for me again it's up on info wars dot com thank you and then print the link on there
[12:33.400 --> 12:39.400]  to Facebook where they admit it so we'll be covering all that when we come back from break
[12:39.400 --> 12:46.400]  them the big story that we have is the main headline on info wars dot com wire Barack
[12:46.400 --> 12:51.400]  Obama and people like Bill Maher warning of civil war and saying they don't want a physical
[12:51.400 --> 12:58.400]  civil war and telling the left don't start one I'm going to break down exactly what's
[12:58.400 --> 13:03.400]  going on on the other side and tie that into the attorney general bar blast Democrats
[13:03.400 --> 13:10.400]  scorched earth campaign to sabotage trump presidency all ties together we're already in a type of
[13:10.400 --> 13:15.400]  civil war but who are the players how do we stop it how we restore the republic and get
[13:15.400 --> 13:25.400]  things back on a more even keel it's all coming up today a lot of big election news we've
[13:25.400 --> 13:34.400]  had three referendums on Trump Virginia Kentucky and now Louisiana in all these special races
[13:34.400 --> 13:41.400]  the republicans are losing because of election fraud and I'll explain it all coming up as
[13:41.400 --> 13:50.400]  well but remember what Professor Robert Epstein no connection to Jeffrey Epstein said last
[13:50.400 --> 13:56.400]  year in this year he had big studies on it and confirms everything we already knew by
[13:56.400 --> 14:02.400]  simply not allowing election notices on Google Facebook and Twitter Republicans and by not
[14:02.400 --> 14:08.400]  letting Republican candidates have normal discussions and spread info that automatically
[14:08.400 --> 14:13.400]  doesn't mobilize conservative voters and you lose every election that way by a margin of
[14:13.400 --> 14:18.400]  about seven points takes about seven points off on average then you get the Democrats
[14:18.400 --> 14:22.400]  old fashioned election fraud folks vote in the names of dead people what's another doing
[14:22.400 --> 14:30.400]  and it's over it's over and then you've got Trump not caring because he thinks that he's
[14:30.400 --> 14:34.400]  so invincible out giving his speeches that that's who got him elected it's only Trump
[14:34.400 --> 14:38.400]  got him elected I'm sorry I love Trump I want to stay in but his confidence is great but
[14:38.400 --> 14:44.400]  it's also a little bit of delusional and they he barely won the spot election fraud and now
[14:44.400 --> 14:48.400]  they're kidding us with a hundred times the fraud and if we don't address it Trump's
[14:48.400 --> 14:55.400]  going to lose in 351 days he can I told you he was going to win okay and I'm telling you
[14:55.400 --> 15:00.400]  he's going to lose right now and there's a lot of people are like oh don't say that
[15:00.400 --> 15:04.400]  that'll make him lose why why are you saying something negative because I'm not a cult
[15:04.400 --> 15:11.400]  member that's why I'm a trailblazer and this great audience of patriots built the launch
[15:11.400 --> 15:21.400]  pad the gantry that launched Trump and I want Trump to succeed but Trump rode in on the
[15:21.400 --> 15:27.400]  wave that this audience created and the Liberty Movement built and our populist Liberty
[15:27.400 --> 15:31.400]  Movement taking over part of the Republican Party there's a big civil war going on there
[15:31.400 --> 15:36.400]  I'll get to as well my god we're seeing censorship out of Charlie Kirk and others that dwarfs
[15:36.400 --> 15:42.400]  anything we're seeing from Democrats at this point college campuses I mean it's just it's
[15:42.400 --> 15:49.400]  it's sick so it's all coming up today but why is Obama and his little cohort Bill Maher
[15:49.400 --> 15:53.400]  on the same day warning of civil war and saying they want to stop one I'll give you my
[15:53.400 --> 16:07.400]  inside research take on that we come back info wars presents the Alex Jones show you supporting
[16:07.400 --> 16:11.400]  the broadcast over the years is why we're still here so that's why you spreading the word is so critical
[16:11.400 --> 16:15.400]  and that's why buying the products is critical because these are great products you already want
[16:15.400 --> 16:19.400]  need and then you literally couldn't thumb your nose the globalist more by holding us up against
[16:19.400 --> 16:23.400]  the wall and we're going to have over the sale usually two three days I'm always busy but
[16:23.400 --> 16:27.400]  this time I just haven't done it because we're selling out a lot of stuff we've already had big

[16:54.400 --> 17:01.400]  percenters so we salute you and thank you info wars dot com forward slash show I spend a
[17:01.400 --> 17:08.400]  lot of time reminding the info wars family of listeners and viewers that without you

[17:12.400 --> 17:16.400]  should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.400]  better and raising the alarm is modern ball of ears but something I should spend more
[17:20.400 --> 17:27.400]  time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing you've got that pledge
[17:27.400 --> 17:31.400]  from me but you've seen the third-party test out there the air filtration the water filtration
[17:31.400 --> 17:36.400]  the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund
[17:36.400 --> 17:42.400]  an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard so it's not a burden
[17:42.400 --> 17:49.400]  to support info wars it really is something that is good for everybody that stands for
[17:49.400 --> 17:54.400]  justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life your children's life so
[17:54.400 --> 18:04.400]  much better so visit info wars store com today about a month ago president trump announced
[18:04.400 --> 18:10.400]  that he was going to move his domicile from new york city to florida where he's always
[18:10.400 --> 18:17.400]  said he planned to retire to and the left got so excited they said oh he's about to resign
[18:17.400 --> 18:23.400]  and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to florida well now we know why
[18:23.400 --> 18:28.400]  the president did that he knew the leftist controlled appeals courts we're going to say
[18:28.400 --> 18:33.400]  that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business
[18:33.400 --> 18:40.400]  partner he's got they want to terrorize people that he's worked with and by moving his domicile
[18:40.400 --> 18:46.400]  from new york to florida that gets around the new york law they passed to get his tax
[18:46.400 --> 18:51.400]  returns that are supposed to be private so all those people out there holding their breath
[18:51.400 --> 18:58.400]  for the president to resign in his words we're kicking the deep states ass and he's never
[18:58.400 --> 19:05.400]  going to resign beto roark came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate
[19:05.400 --> 19:10.400]  all your semi automatic rifles and he got all the other democrats on the stage nine others
[19:10.400 --> 19:16.400]  to agree and said that he was a hero think about that now those democrats have taken
[19:16.400 --> 19:21.400]  all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered
[19:21.400 --> 19:27.400]  with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they
[19:27.400 --> 19:33.400]  know what they're doing and now the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers
[19:33.400 --> 19:38.400]  can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies
[19:38.400 --> 19:44.400]  and gentlemen this country's under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are
[19:44.400 --> 19:48.400]  saying they're sanctuaries for the second amendment and they're going to follow the original bill
[19:48.400 --> 19:53.400]  of rights and constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so
[19:53.400 --> 19:58.400]  you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens well we could ignore all your unconstitutional
[19:58.400 --> 20:19.400]  laws you're listening to the alex jones show big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[20:19.400 --> 20:28.400]  you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex
[20:28.400 --> 20:44.400]  jones welcome back i am your host alex jones i believe in a pro human future i believe
[20:44.400 --> 20:51.400]  in a vision of the planet that's based on the greater ideas that our founders dreamed
[20:51.400 --> 20:58.400]  of they never fully realized it neither will we but it's certainly been a lot better than
[20:58.400 --> 21:03.400]  what other cultures and systems have had to offer and the authoritarians of the planet
[21:03.400 --> 21:08.400]  are in direct admitted competition with the original american model of the renaissance
[21:08.400 --> 21:14.400]  and are attempting to shut it down destroy it again thank you for joining us on this live sunday program
[21:14.400 --> 21:20.400]  please remember that the globalist or the post humanist as they internally call themselves
[21:20.400 --> 21:26.400]  do not want this broadcast on the air in any way you can spread the word about it continually
[21:26.400 --> 21:35.400]  isn't just paramount it is essential it is critical okay let me lay it out right now
[21:35.400 --> 21:45.400]  why has barack obama come out in multiple speeches in the last few weeks both publicly and privately
[21:45.400 --> 21:55.400]  to their top donors a lot of them actual globalist controllers and why is he saying we don't want
[21:55.400 --> 22:05.400]  a violent revolution we are on the verge of a civil war we need to not look so radical to
[22:05.400 --> 22:15.400]  voters and those videos and articles are up on info wars dot com why is he saying that
[22:15.400 --> 22:22.400]  well for a lot of reasons but it's good cop bad cop soros and the Ford foundation the
[22:22.400 --> 22:27.400]  carney foundation they all fund antifa and the universities and the systems attacking free
[22:27.400 --> 22:34.400]  speech and every major corporation sprite you name it coca-cola corporation or promoting
[22:34.400 --> 22:39.400]  parents telling their five-year-olds their girls and screwing them up as part of the war
[22:39.400 --> 22:46.400]  on boys and masculinity I mean whatever you see coming out of the system is what the system wants
[22:46.400 --> 22:52.400]  so but but but they want the general public to think it's just radicals and extremists and a
[22:52.400 --> 23:00.400]  bunch of hippies that want all this when this is the globalist plan all along and so it's come
[23:00.400 --> 23:06.400]  out that the big comedy shows confer with the think tanks and with obama and hillary in the
[23:06.400 --> 23:10.400]  deep state jimmy kimmel's talked about it others have talked about how they have long
[23:10.400 --> 23:17.400]  been doing things every day deciding what they're going to put on late night comedy because
[23:17.400 --> 23:22.400]  that has more viewers than all the new shows combined and people still tend to believe
[23:22.400 --> 23:26.400]  some of what they see on that at eleven o'clock at night ten o'clock at night when they're
[23:26.400 --> 23:31.400]  drunk people go into suspended disbelief when that's on so when you watch Saturday night
[23:31.400 --> 23:37.400]  live or you watch any of these comedy shows they're not comedy shows anymore they're
[23:37.400 --> 23:42.400]  shackled they're weaponized and they admit they are that's not even disputed now so why
[23:42.400 --> 23:51.400]  would you have all these different shows coming out Saturday night live Saturday bill mar with
[23:51.400 --> 23:56.400]  his show friday night real time bill mar as saturday comes out I always see clips I don't
[23:56.400 --> 24:02.400]  watch it live and all these other programs are coming out doing this because they know
[24:02.400 --> 24:06.400]  voters are scared and they know that people understand that they're dangerous so they're
[24:06.400 --> 24:11.400]  shocked like that's not us now I know what I just said is elementary but the next part
[24:11.400 --> 24:17.400]  of it is this they are planning to trigger political violence very very soon and blame
[24:17.400 --> 24:22.400]  Trump supporters and blame independent media and call for even more censorship and the
[24:22.400 --> 24:26.400]  takedown not not just the people on Facebook YouTube or you know other things but our
[24:26.400 --> 24:32.400]  websites themselves to be taken down our bank accounts and they admit that's the plan so
[24:32.400 --> 24:38.400]  they're planning and winding up more people like we saw it Christchurch in New Zealand
[24:38.400 --> 24:44.400]  like we saw in texas with the anti-fagoon going in at the walmart and the admitted anti-fag
[24:44.400 --> 24:50.400]  devil worshipper in Ohio the same day those guys were all anti-fag and it came out that
[24:50.400 --> 24:54.400]  they were but you never saw it on the national news they've successfully covered it up
[24:54.400 --> 25:01.400]  partially in texas but in New Zealand and in Ohio they it all came out just like the guy
[25:01.400 --> 25:11.400]  you know this mentally ill person in Florida last February Cruz was threatening 44 times
[25:11.400 --> 25:16.400]  to kill people the police were called 40 more times that we know of the FBI twice he was
[25:16.400 --> 25:20.400]  on a special program he was allowed to commit crimes his last name was Cruz had left his
[25:20.400 --> 25:25.400]  program to quote not send minorities to jail he wasn't even Hispanic Hispanics had adopted
[25:25.400 --> 25:29.400]  him both his parents recently died the point is just that that's the MO and they're getting
[25:29.400 --> 25:34.400]  ready for something really big so they want to sound like the peacemakers right before
[25:34.400 --> 25:38.400]  it I've always said when they come out and say we don't want a civil war we don't want
[25:38.400 --> 25:45.400]  revolution that's so they can say look we warned of this beforehand before they trigger
[25:45.400 --> 25:51.400]  it also we know there's high level negotiations going on with the attorney general and different
[25:51.400 --> 25:57.400]  segments the deep state to surrender and stop the mutiny and stop the illegal resistance
[25:57.400 --> 26:01.400]  against the newly elected president with all the fake reports are putting out the crimes
[26:01.400 --> 26:06.400]  and the illegal leaking and the sabotage of U.S. domestic and foreign policy but they
[26:06.400 --> 26:12.400]  only negotiate in those meetings that we know been going on to stall while they're trying
[26:12.400 --> 26:17.400]  to overthrow Trump and to give operatives inside the White House that are double agents
[26:17.400 --> 26:22.400]  the cover to confuse the president and stall him from taking action and demanding that
[26:22.400 --> 26:29.400]  Barr and others do their job so that's really what's going on here and this bellwethers
[26:29.400 --> 26:40.400]  weather veins is a real signpost a gauge an indicator a trigger warning that 351 days
[26:40.400 --> 26:45.400]  out from the election we're in very very very dangerous waters when they start telegraphing
[26:45.400 --> 26:49.400]  this so first here's the attorney general's info wars dot com article if you want to see
[26:49.400 --> 26:54.400]  more of the speech bar blast Democrats scores Earth campaign to sabotage Trump presidency
[26:54.400 --> 26:59.400]  this is totally true and think about the fact that he has to talk like this in America
[26:59.400 --> 27:04.400]  about the Democrats and others literally in the government engaging in mass mutiny against
[27:04.400 --> 27:12.400]  the American people here it is unfortunately unfortunately just in the past few years we
[27:12.400 --> 27:19.400]  have seen this con these conflicts take on an entirely new character immediately after
[27:19.400 --> 27:26.400]  President Trump won election opponents inaugurated what they called the resistance and they
[27:26.400 --> 27:36.400]  rallied around an explicit strategy of using every tool and maneuver to sabotage the functioning
[27:36.400 --> 27:43.400]  of the executive branch and his administration the fact of the matter is that in waging a
[27:43.400 --> 27:52.400]  scorched earth no holds barred war of resistance against this administration it is the left
[27:52.400 --> 28:00.400]  that is engaged in the systematic shredding of norms and undermining the rule of law notice
[28:00.400 --> 28:09.400]  he said it's the left the left are not liberals the left tried to take over the liberal movement
[28:09.400 --> 28:16.400]  that was the Renaissance that started 200 years before that and that's in the history books
[28:16.400 --> 28:24.400]  the left is a satanic movement that is admittedly satanic you may have heard of it it's called
[28:24.400 --> 28:30.400]  the Illuminati George Washington wrote a bunch of letters about it you can read them online
[28:30.400 --> 28:34.400]  type in George Washington's letters on the Illuminati it will be at the U.S. Gov website
[28:34.400 --> 28:39.400]  and Thomas Jefferson was the leader of it for a while found out it was really bad got out of it
[28:39.400 --> 28:45.400]  but yeah so that's what's going on that's real history and the left hand gave you Stalin
[28:45.400 --> 28:51.400]  Mao gave you Hitler gave you Mussolini Mussolini was actually a leftist occultist we'll be
[28:51.400 --> 29:00.400]  right back we're going to get to what Bill Maher said about the coming civil war
[29:00.400 --> 29:07.400]  there's a famous quote by Marine Corps general in the Korean War when 3 million Chikoms had flooded
[29:07.400 --> 29:14.400]  across the border and surrounded the Marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it
[29:14.400 --> 29:19.400]  but the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told general were completely
[29:19.400 --> 29:25.400]  surrounded he said good we can attack in all directions well that's the point that
[29:25.400 --> 29:31.400]  Info Wars has reached and it really is epic it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far
[29:31.400 --> 29:38.400]  without all your support but it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship
[29:38.400 --> 29:43.400]  becomes complete and it's not just Americans but folks all over the world are completely
[29:43.400 --> 29:49.400]  silenced when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile
[29:49.400 --> 29:55.400]  or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by Info Wars having its own platform
[29:55.400 --> 29:59.400]  that checkmates the globalists
[30:01.400 --> 30:12.400]  a question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to
[30:12.400 --> 30:19.400]  how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the limit to which other men and women
[30:19.400 --> 30:27.400]  will submit the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit
[30:27.400 --> 30:35.400]  we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will
[30:35.400 --> 30:42.400]  there's no devil or the God but those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can
[30:42.400 --> 30:49.400]  dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values
[30:49.400 --> 30:56.400]  so they can run over us Oxford's band clapping universities the US of band 21 guns salutes for veterans
[30:56.400 --> 31:00.400]  these people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them
[31:00.400 --> 31:08.400]  the globalists know that I will never willingly give up I've said it many times I will never give in
[31:08.400 --> 31:17.400]  I will never give up but I could give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity
[31:17.400 --> 31:25.400]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace
[31:25.400 --> 31:31.400]  that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech and to know that most Americans
[31:31.400 --> 31:39.400]  feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot com
[31:39.400 --> 31:44.400]  info wars dot com and banned on video and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever
[31:44.400 --> 31:50.400]  and then if you tell people hey the banned truth they don't want you to have is at info wars dot com
[31:50.400 --> 31:56.400]  port slash show and banned on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody and show everybody down
[31:56.400 --> 32:01.400]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square
[32:01.400 --> 32:09.400]  about a month ago president trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from new york city to florida
[32:09.400 --> 32:17.400]  where he's always said he planned to retire to and the left got so excited they said oh he's about to resign
[32:17.400 --> 32:24.400]  and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to florida well now we know why the president did that
[32:24.400 --> 32:30.400]  he knew the leftist controlled appeals courts were going to say that he had to give up his tax returns
[32:30.400 --> 32:38.400]  so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got they want to terrorize people that he's worked with
[32:38.400 --> 32:46.400]  and by moving his domicile from new york to florida that gets around the new york law they passed to get his tax returns
[32:46.400 --> 32:53.400]  that are supposed to be private so all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign
[32:53.400 --> 33:20.400]  in his words we're kicking the deep states ass and he's never going to resign
[33:23.400 --> 33:30.400]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex joe's
[33:54.400 --> 34:07.400]  so here we are in 2019 late 2019 and the attorney general of the united states is talking about the democratic party
[34:07.400 --> 34:16.400]  with operatives inside the government rebelling against law and trying to sabotage the executive branch at every level they can't
[34:16.400 --> 34:29.400]  there are hundreds and hundreds of articles that i've seen just the last few days saying damning evidence
[34:29.400 --> 34:37.400]  of trump engaging in illegal activity quid pro quo given at the impeachment hearings this week
[34:37.400 --> 34:45.400]  and then you read the article there is no damning evidence it's just more of the same rumors you ask why are they doing that
[34:45.400 --> 34:51.400]  they're doing that to create the illusion within the political class that trump is indeed in trouble
[34:51.400 --> 34:57.400]  so they can twist arms of republican senators to go for it because they've done psychological studies on who they're targeting
[34:57.400 --> 35:09.400]  they know that the old senators average age about 76 right at 76 but still believes mainstream media and still thinks it carries weight
[35:09.400 --> 35:17.400]  separately though they know the general public is sick of this it had no viewers they know trump's innocent
[35:17.400 --> 35:29.400]  and so comedy central and nbc's programs like saturday night live come out and say this whole thing's a giant joke
[35:29.400 --> 35:38.400]  it's ridiculous trump didn't do anything wrong why would they do that to maintain some credibility with their viewers when they know they've gone too far
[35:38.400 --> 35:44.400]  or he's just some of that in a moment as well
[35:44.400 --> 35:53.400]  and again they're also on the surface trying to make deals with trump right now not to prosecute them because the inspector general report is coming out
[35:53.400 --> 36:02.400]  and there has been an indictment of mccabe that's been confirmed because the deputy attorney general refused to kill the indictment
[36:02.400 --> 36:09.400]  which i don't think the justice department should have the power to do that should come out of the grand juries once they convene one and once they indict that should be it
[36:09.400 --> 36:16.400]  but that's where the power is and two months ago now they said no we're going to allow that to go forward he is indicted
[36:16.400 --> 36:26.400]  and that's when all hell started breaking loose because once that domino falls mccabe has said he'll sing like a canary against obama hillary clapper brennan
[36:26.400 --> 36:38.400]  mueller comey and the rest of them so this fight is very real and trumps the real deal he wants good business deals for america he cares about the nation existing
[36:38.400 --> 36:52.400]  and he's surrounded by a bunch of cowards and yes men but the out of control behavior of the deep state has been so criminal and so dangerous and they're not stopping other elements of the deep state are now being forced to move against them
[36:52.400 --> 37:11.400]  so 40 years of stagnation and the political class becoming more and more corrupt and all these spoiled brat cia and fbi and foundation bureaucrats at the top who believe they're god and who go on c span and brag thank god for the deep state
[37:11.400 --> 37:27.400]  we're going to remove trump the intelligence agencies are schumer said that right after trump was elected on the eve of his inauguration in january 2017 just a few weeks ago brennan
[37:27.400 --> 37:32.400]  was at an event on c span and they were bragging about it
[37:32.400 --> 37:45.400]  so they forced themselves out in the open you realize how damaging that is to the globalist the deep state that all these decades there's no world government there's no deep state there's no permanent bureaucracy that controls both parties
[37:45.400 --> 37:57.400]  and now they're losing control the republican party and so the democratic party has been promised total power by the deep state if they can remove the republicans
[37:57.400 --> 38:08.400]  and there are a lot of republicans rolling over and saying hey i'll retire early and get paid off by you guys they're tapping out there they're running for the hills record numbers
[38:08.400 --> 38:19.400]  but record numbers of individuals are stepping into their shoes the problem is the deep state the democrats are going to pull out all the stops of the election fraud with intimidation with dirty tricks
[38:19.400 --> 38:30.400]  and that's why trumps got to move and he has to move decisively not just with rhetoric not just with tweets that is important but with action
[38:30.400 --> 38:40.400]  so let's go to bill mar the full eight minute clubs up on info wars dot com here he is on HBO just like us last night
[38:40.400 --> 38:46.400]  and everything's backhanded over so many republicans they'll work with the Russians give me a break
[38:46.400 --> 38:54.400]  it's the left that's anti-american it's the left wants to sell out our sovereignty so he mixes in the lives but he says we don't want a civil war
[38:54.400 --> 39:03.400]  well that's because they're getting ready to trigger the physical one they do want a civil war but they want to blame it on us they're getting ready to false flag us
[39:03.400 --> 39:10.400]  so remember it's always the opposite of what they say if you invert what they say nine times out of ten you will get the answer
[39:10.400 --> 39:20.400]  so Mars saying we're about to pull the trigger on you we've got the sleeper cells ready I noticed Obama's been given the speech in private and now in public the last two weeks
[39:20.400 --> 39:31.400]  now Mars saying now suddenly Sanders is acting like a conservative oh we can't confiscate guns that's unconstitutional after agreeing to it a few months ago on the stage
[39:31.400 --> 39:42.400]  so they're gonna try to look reasonable for a few months hoping you don't have a memory before they trigger the false flags you absolutely know it's coming
[39:42.400 --> 39:54.400]  crazy people they've got wound up totally staged events everybody better be very visual and better be paying attention to everything right now because the next 351 days are unbelievably important
[39:54.400 --> 40:07.400]  so here's part of Bill Maher joining the president former president Obama in oh we don't want to fight we don't want any violence after they've amped it up and pushed it here it is
[40:07.400 --> 40:17.400]  now lately we've been hearing more and more about a second civil war which sounds impossible in this modern affluent country it is not
[40:17.400 --> 40:25.400]  we all talk about Trump as an existential threat but his side sees democratic control of government the exact same way
[40:25.400 --> 40:32.400]  and when both sides believe the other guy taking over means the end of the world yes you can have a civil war
[40:32.400 --> 40:40.400]  Trump rallies are filled with words like enemies of the people human scum they talk of people to be locked up
[40:40.400 --> 40:50.400]  well you can't lock us all up liberals are described as weak lame coddling oversensitive and limp-dicked
[40:50.400 --> 41:04.400]  which are strong words for a bunch of mouth breather kickers knuckle-draggers
[41:04.400 --> 41:13.400]  Bible flumper sister and roots
[41:13.400 --> 41:25.400]  yes I have been guilty of saying things like that but I'm going to try to stop because I've learned that the anti-intellectualism on the right doesn't come primarily from stupidity
[41:25.400 --> 41:35.400]  it comes from hate telling people you think they're irredeemable is what makes them say you know what I'd rather side with Russia than you
[41:35.400 --> 41:42.400]  even if the democrats win everything in 2020 the republicans will still be here they're not going to self-deport
[41:42.400 --> 41:52.400]  they're in congress in your office sometimes you're home home is where you learn that the three magic words in any relationship aren't I love you
[41:52.400 --> 41:59.400]  they're let it go let it go
[41:59.400 --> 42:07.400]  guy this is all about he's the referee they stir up the fight they break down the family they hype up the racism
[42:07.400 --> 42:14.400]  and then he comes in as the judge and the juror and the referee and the jail guard the warden
[42:14.400 --> 42:23.400]  you know they divide up prisons according to race and they play into racial divisions and then they control you through the leaders of each gang
[42:23.400 --> 42:30.400]  and that's all this is is someone praying on his audience
[42:30.400 --> 42:37.400]  you know the truth is if there was a real civil war republican versus democrats you guys would last five minutes and you know it
[42:37.400 --> 42:45.400]  you've got the losers you've got the drug addicts you've got the mental patients and you've got statistically in studies the scam artists and criminals that control them
[42:45.400 --> 42:53.400]  and feed off them and who use the losers to make us feel sorry for them to have an excuse to keep pumping out more welfare money you use to further domesticate people
[42:53.400 --> 43:00.400]  no the truth is Bill Maher is a signaling they're getting ready to launch violence that's what he just said
[43:00.400 --> 43:09.400]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true but I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball
[43:09.400 --> 43:16.400]  I could see where the globalists were going I could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was
[43:16.400 --> 43:24.400]  and I knew that when they were setting us up to be de-platformed that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air
[43:24.400 --> 43:34.400]  to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed
[43:34.400 --> 43:46.400]  what the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced
[43:46.400 --> 43:59.400]  because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever
[43:59.400 --> 44:03.400]  info wars presents the Alex Jones show

[44:54.400 --> 44:59.400]  so we salute you and thank you info wars.com forward slash show
[44:59.400 --> 45:10.400]  about a month ago president trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida where he's always said he
[45:10.400 --> 45:22.400]  planned to retire to and the left got so excited they said oh he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida
[45:22.400 --> 45:30.400]  well now we know why the president did that he knew the leftist controlled appeals courts we're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns
[45:30.400 --> 45:38.400]  so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got they want to terrorize people that he's worked with
[45:38.400 --> 45:48.400]  and by moving his domicile from New York to Florida that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private
[45:48.400 --> 45:59.400]  so all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign in his words we're kicking the deep states ass and he's never going to resign
[45:59.400 --> 46:11.400]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air and I spent a lot of time thanking you
[46:11.400 --> 46:19.400]  but I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres
[46:19.400 --> 46:26.400]  but something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing
[46:26.400 --> 46:35.400]  you've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party test out there the air filtration the water filtration the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there
[46:35.400 --> 46:45.400]  and you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard so it's not a burden to support info wars
[46:45.400 --> 47:02.400]  it really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better so visit infowarstore.com today
[47:02.400 --> 47:07.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:32.400 --> 47:41.400]  100% income tax and I would read those headlines from the financial times of London and others on air and listeners thought I was joking
[47:41.400 --> 47:57.400]  well Elizabeth Warren has proposed a 100% tax on millionaires and billionaires a 100% tax on capital gains things like that
[47:57.400 --> 48:05.400]  of course who's lobbying for all of that the billionaires who want to take the money off shore want to make sure no investments made America
[48:05.400 --> 48:08.400]  it's incredible
[48:08.400 --> 48:17.400]  it's just like China had a 15% income tax on corporations we had a 40 to 45 depending on the variant
[48:17.400 --> 48:23.400]  and then Trump got it lowered to 15 and China went to zero because they want it all to stay there
[48:23.400 --> 48:33.400]  it's unbelievable but when you see Bill Gates get up there all the time on the news and go I want to pay more taxes and Warren Buffett they put their money in a tax free foundation
[48:33.400 --> 48:44.400]  Bill Gates has made over $200 billion since he put his money in the tax free foundation he only made 50 something million by the time he set it up I mean it's just incredible
[48:44.400 --> 48:54.400]  Warren Buffett back in the 60s set up captive insurance I've researched it where he's been paid $100,000 a year since like 1965 look it up
[48:54.400 --> 49:04.400]  but after his congressman father died believe me I've looked into it it's amazing and he puts all his money into captive insurance and then never pays any taxes on it
[49:04.400 --> 49:18.400]  I mean folks it's just incredible how they scam everybody but they always tell kind of the lottery ticket type folks I'm not putting you down if you're about a lottery ticket but people that imagine this is going to fix it it's going to be great
[49:18.400 --> 49:28.400]  Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett they've all got their money off shore they all pay almost no tax
[49:28.400 --> 49:41.400]  and then they tell you how they're liberal and they fund Black Lives Matter yeah well we're busy hating the cops for a couple hundred black men that might be killed wrongly every year and it's terrible
[49:41.400 --> 49:49.400]  there's millions of black people killed in abortion you never hear about it see funded by these same guys Bill Gates's dad used to run Plamp-Arenade and that's what I'm getting at is
[49:49.400 --> 49:54.400]  why would they fund Black Lives Matter hundreds of millions these guys put hundreds of millions into it
[49:54.400 --> 50:02.400]  because while they're screwing everybody over they have us have a race war that's why these guys are cold blooded
[50:02.400 --> 50:08.400]  but who's gonna listen to me the left loves being conned they love being idiots
[50:08.400 --> 50:12.400]  let me get back to the big news here
[50:12.400 --> 50:18.400]  we are in a civil war between globalist forces and forces that want our nation to be America
[50:18.400 --> 50:26.400]  and that want our values not the globalist values of foreign offshore banks running us in open borders and the break up of the family and gun confiscation
[50:26.400 --> 50:32.400]  all the nightmares you know and the globalist taking their money offshore and being tax exempt but you can't even take your money out of the country
[50:32.400 --> 50:36.400]  Obama changed the law with the average citizen can't get their money out now
[50:36.400 --> 50:45.400]  I was talking to one of John Wayne's sons about that out in Wemberley before they left the U.S. like ten years ago
[50:45.400 --> 50:51.400]  and he's like well you better get your money out of the country and I said I don't have any extra money to get out of the country like you
[50:51.400 --> 50:58.400]  but we're going to Costa Rica like your show we'll listen to it from down there
[50:58.400 --> 51:03.400]  I was out in Wemberley staying at some friend's house next door and I said oh that's John Wayne's little son over here
[51:03.400 --> 51:11.400]  there's John Wayne's son but the point is is that the money's gone folks it left the ultra rich don't pay taxes
[51:11.400 --> 51:15.400]  they just get the general public to pay it and they siphon it off
[51:15.400 --> 51:19.400]  I'm going to stop right there
[51:19.400 --> 51:23.400]  we're on the verge of a hot civil war in this country
[51:23.400 --> 51:32.400]  the globalists know they're losing it so they want to go ahead and kick one off to destabilize things
[51:32.400 --> 51:38.400]  and just as sure as the sun came up they're going to stage false flag attacks it's like Clinton did in 95 with Oklahoma City
[51:38.400 --> 51:41.400]  but it will get him elected the next year
[51:41.400 --> 51:47.400]  look it up Bill Clinton credited Oklahoma City bombing with reelection he was 15 points behind even in their fake polls
[51:47.400 --> 51:51.400]  probably 30 points behind but by the time that happened he won
[51:51.400 --> 51:55.400]  so why are they so scared right now they're fake impeachments failing
[51:55.400 --> 51:58.400]  Trump's real approval rating sky high
[51:58.400 --> 52:06.400]  but there's a problem Trump hasn't backed up people persecuted by the deep state threatened sued attacked their families attacked
[52:06.400 --> 52:12.400]  so it's open season on the Republican leadership on the Senate on House members that have been shot
[52:12.400 --> 52:15.400]  that had their ribs broken
[52:15.400 --> 52:19.400]  and a lot of them aren't like Skelisse or Rand Paul that will get more hardcore under attack
[52:19.400 --> 52:22.400]  they're not all like Alex Jones more hardcore under attack
[52:22.400 --> 52:25.400]  a lot of folks quietly sell out
[52:25.400 --> 52:32.400]  and it's Trump's not pardoning the songs and so far not pardoning Roger Stone and things like that
[52:32.400 --> 52:37.400]  but he is undoing not standing up for his most hardcore supporters and doing his duty
[52:37.400 --> 52:40.400]  and I'm not even mad at Trump I'm saying Trump needs to stand up to this
[52:40.400 --> 52:43.400]  and the election fraud and the rest of it now
[52:47.400 --> 52:54.400]  they know Trump and the Justice Department are close to action because they just know that the alternative is just too dangerous for everything
[52:54.400 --> 52:59.400]  a big part of the establishment realizes that this needs to be stopped
[52:59.400 --> 53:03.400]  there's a civil war in the establishment that's what's really going on
[53:03.400 --> 53:09.400]  there's a lot of indecision because most of these people didn't make their money they got it from their great great grandpas
[53:09.400 --> 53:13.400]  and they're almost all into Satanism they're all incredibly screwed up
[53:13.400 --> 53:17.400]  pedophilia is just run-of-the-mill that's all coming out
[53:17.400 --> 53:21.400]  and this is an establishment in crisis
[53:21.400 --> 53:25.400]  the level of mental illness the inbreeding it's just stratus fever
[53:25.400 --> 53:30.400]  and they've got so much money to pump into media to weaponize the population
[53:30.400 --> 53:35.400]  in a hope to drive Trump from power and all it's done
[53:35.400 --> 53:41.400]  is set the country on course for civil war so they're trying to convince themselves how triggering the civil war
[53:41.400 --> 53:46.400]  how they're going to be able to sit it out and somehow win and I just don't think that's the case
[53:46.400 --> 53:51.400]  they are going to destroy their entire power structure and the process may be the whole planet
[53:51.400 --> 53:55.400]  so it's a very dangerous time to be alive
[53:55.400 --> 53:59.400]  let's play a little bit of this Saturday Night Live piece
[53:59.400 --> 54:03.400]  and then the full things on it for us dot com but here it is
[54:03.400 --> 54:10.400]  this week 13 million Americans tuned in to watch the impeachment hearings as multiple officials testified against President Trump
[54:10.400 --> 54:16.400]  but some complained the hearings were lacking in pizzazz, dull and not the masked singer
[54:16.400 --> 54:23.400]  so to make sure people are paying attention we now present the hearings in a way that underscores how scandalous these revelations really are
[54:23.400 --> 54:25.400]  this is
[54:25.400 --> 54:31.400]  days of our impeachment where the only thing at stake is democracy
[54:31.400 --> 54:34.400]  starring Adam Schiff
[54:34.400 --> 54:39.400]  excitement emotion and none of it from me
[54:39.400 --> 54:44.400]  cross-examiner with a mysterious brain injury Jim Jordan
[54:44.400 --> 54:50.400]  I've got my sleeves rolled up cause my job is yelling at a woman
[54:50.400 --> 54:55.400]  former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich
[54:55.400 --> 54:59.400]  why did Trump come after me? I committed the ultimate sin
[54:59.400 --> 55:02.400]  I was good at my job
[55:02.400 --> 55:08.400]  and John Hamm has career diplomat Bill Taylor
[55:08.400 --> 55:11.400]  I don't just kiss and tell
[55:11.400 --> 55:15.400]  I kiss and tell and I take notes
[55:15.400 --> 55:21.400]  like tweets through your timeline this is days of our impeachment
[55:25.400 --> 55:26.400]  Order in the chamber
[55:26.400 --> 55:29.400]  Ambassador Yovanovich your opening statement
[55:29.400 --> 55:33.400]  thank you Chairman Schiff if that is your real name
[55:33.400 --> 55:34.400]  it is
[55:34.400 --> 55:41.400]  okay great I'm only here today because I was a target of a smear campaign by President Trump
[55:41.400 --> 55:45.400]  and Rudy Giuliani that left me publicly humiliated and without a job
[55:45.400 --> 55:52.400]  enough enough this witness is clearly here because she loves attention
[55:52.400 --> 56:00.400]  oh yeah I love the glamour and the spotlight that's why I spent my career in Ukraine and Somalia
[56:00.400 --> 56:04.400]  funny you should mention Somalia because the president
[56:04.400 --> 56:08.400]  it's right behind me is that why you look so shocked
[56:08.400 --> 56:12.400]  no this is just how my eyes look
[56:12.400 --> 56:15.400]  the president just sent a tweet
[56:15.400 --> 56:17.400]  a tweet
[56:20.400 --> 56:24.400]  let the record show that the president is intimidating the witness
[56:24.400 --> 56:32.400]  intimidating if the president wanted to intimidate you he'd shoot you in the face in the middle of Fifth Avenue
[56:32.400 --> 56:36.400]  okay and then would you impeach him
[56:36.400 --> 56:39.400]  well I'd have to look at the facts but no
[56:39.400 --> 56:41.400]  not so fast
[56:41.400 --> 56:43.400]  Sam Taylor
[56:43.400 --> 56:45.400]  what are you doing here
[56:45.400 --> 56:49.400]  unlike other people in the Trump administration I show up
[56:49.400 --> 56:52.400]  and I have a bombshell revelation
[56:52.400 --> 56:56.400]  there was a second phone call
[56:56.400 --> 56:58.400]  a second phone call
[57:01.400 --> 57:06.400]  that's right you knew about the first call but no one expected phone call number two
[57:06.400 --> 57:10.400]  and someone say unexpected number two
[57:10.400 --> 57:16.400]  let's stop right there and of course it's boring it's not really funny but they just go on to admit there's nothing there
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.400]  why are they doing that because they know it didn't sell it didn't work
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.400]  they know that no one's buying it except the people that are still in their cult
[57:24.400 --> 57:28.400]  so why are they acting like this to make you go back to sleep
[57:28.400 --> 57:30.400]  think everything's okay
[57:30.400 --> 57:35.400]  while they dig up the next big lie they're gonna bring forward in the ongoing impeachment process
[57:35.400 --> 57:39.400]  it'll be the president's mental health taxes women saying he raped him
[57:39.400 --> 57:43.400]  you're going to see it all because these people are all just puppets
[57:43.400 --> 57:45.400]  they've got powerful globalists telling them what to do
[57:45.400 --> 57:50.400]  hour number two straight ahead
[57:50.400 --> 57:54.400]  there's a famous quote by Marine Corps general in the Korean War
[57:54.400 --> 58:00.400]  when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines
[58:00.400 --> 58:04.400]  more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it
[58:04.400 --> 58:08.400]  but the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told
[58:08.400 --> 58:13.400]  general were completely surrounded he said good we can attack in all directions
[58:13.400 --> 58:17.400]  well that's the point that info wars has reached
[58:17.400 --> 58:21.400]  and it really is epic it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far
[58:21.400 --> 58:23.400]  without all your support
[58:23.400 --> 58:30.400]  but it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete
[58:30.400 --> 58:34.400]  and it's not just Americans but folks all over the world are completely silenced
[58:34.400 --> 58:39.400]  when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile
[58:39.400 --> 58:43.400]  or speaking out against dangerous vaccines
[58:43.400 --> 58:49.400]  because by info wars having its own platform that check makes the globalist
[58:49.400 --> 58:54.400]  a question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson
[58:54.400 --> 59:02.400]  what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to
[59:02.400 --> 59:04.400]  how far will they go what's their limit
[59:04.400 --> 59:11.400]  and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit
[59:11.400 --> 59:17.400]  the answer is there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit
[59:17.400 --> 59:23.400]  we've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist
[59:23.400 --> 59:26.400]  or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god
[59:26.400 --> 59:30.400]  but those very same people have all these rules for us about speech
[59:30.400 --> 59:37.400]  and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like
[59:37.400 --> 59:41.400]  they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us
[59:41.400 --> 59:43.400]  Oxford's band clapping
[59:43.400 --> 59:46.400]  University of the US of band 21 gun salutes for veterans
[59:46.400 --> 1:00:01.400]  these people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them
[1:00:01.400 --> 1:00:30.400]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:32.400]  the power didn't come from me
[1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:38.400]  I could feel God's spirit like a wind of hurricane through my sails
[1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:43.400]  it's as scary as a ship slams through the waves faster and faster
[1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:48.400]  lightning and the rain going down sideways flashes
[1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:53.400]  sails have to bust they'd ever do
[1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:57.400]  not until a heart blows into 100 pieces
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:00.400]  and the earth's soup cuts off
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:08.400]  and the spirit leaves
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:11.400]  all right
[1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:14.400]  let's get into this little piece of news ahead of Barnes joining us
[1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:18.400]  and we have another lawyer robert roger stones lawyer popping in with us
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:22.400]  and then the last segment I'm going to hit the big 5G, 6G news
[1:01:22.400 --> 1:01:24.400]  and the latest that's come out on it that's so important
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:29.400]  how it ties into Facebook spying on you but let me play Dan rather
[1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:33.400]  you'll notice when you hear him it's the same thing we've heard from Tom Brokejaw
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:36.400]  it's the same thing we've heard from all these other guys they've gotten out of mothballs
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:39.400]  thinking well they're not listening to our new experts
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:42.400]  let's roll out some other talking heads
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:47.400]  and they thought oh the truth's closing in oh the walls are closing
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:50.400]  and we've been hearing this for three years
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:53.400]  they're given the same scripts over and over again here it is
[1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:59.400]  it's becoming increasingly apparent that truth is closing in
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:01.400]  truth does matter
[1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:07.400]  and it's been this feeling for a long time that well the White House with this alternate narrative
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:11.400]  a false narrative and with his allies in prime time on Fox
[1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:14.400]  was at least in a standoff with truth
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:17.400]  I think we've seen over the last few days
[1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:21.400]  as I say truth is beginning to close in facts are beginning to matter
[1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:24.400]  as you said the other day I've covered many cults
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:27.400]  some end with a bang others with a whimper but they invariably end
[1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:30.400]  the question is how much damage they leave in their wake
[1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:33.400]  is Mitch McConnell part of the Trump cult?
[1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:36.400]  yes I think the short answer is yes
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:40.400]  and I'm not the only one making this observation that increasingly
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:43.400]  President Trump's support seems cultish
[1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:48.400]  it's all about him it's not about the policy it's not about the standards of politics
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:51.400]  Ronald Reagan had a very solid following
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:54.400]  but he stood for something in terms of policy
[1:02:54.400 --> 1:02:58.400]  Franklin Roosevelt the same way that these cults
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:01.400]  cults generally don't end well
[1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:05.400]  cults don't generally end well
[1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:08.400]  see the full video at infowars.com and newswars.com
[1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:11.400]  I mean nothing against old people I love old people
[1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:16.400]  but what is it about Dan Rather, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:18.400]  they can't talk
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:21.400]  I mean they definitely had strokes
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:26.400]  in and around the language centers the brain
[1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:30.400]  how about a dying globalist deep state cult
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:33.400]  that thinks it just owns the country and owns everybody else
[1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:36.400]  here they are bragging on c-span with Brennan about
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:39.400]  thank God with the deep state that Dan Rather used to say didn't exist
[1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:41.400]  here it is
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:45.400]  agree that now the impeachment inquiry is underway
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:48.400]  sparked by a complaint from someone within
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:50.400]  the intelligence community
[1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:53.400]  it feeds the president's concern
[1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:56.400]  and often use term about a deep state
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:58.400]  being there to take him out
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:00.400]  thanks God for the deep state
[1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:02.400]  oh yeah thank God
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:04.400]  back to that 20 seconds please
[1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:06.400]  look at the look of your TV viewer
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:09.400]  Brennan is seething with a acting powerful
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:12.400]  in front of a room of blue blood
[1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:15.400]  Ivy League Spooks that never killed anybody
[1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:17.400]  you know in the military and overseas
[1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:20.400]  they've got the area where the Spooks are at
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:22.400]  with Caviar and Lobster and Filet Mignon
[1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:24.400]  and then all the special operations troops
[1:04:24.400 --> 1:04:26.400]  that are all worked to death like horses
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:28.400]  out of Animal Farm
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:30.400]  and literally
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:32.400]  I mean the deep staters are mutilating their children
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:34.400]  having their genitals cut off
[1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:36.400]  that's how they get around you have pedophilia openly
[1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:38.400]  pedophiles just you don't have sex with a kid
[1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:40.400]  they actually chop their children's genitals off
[1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:42.400]  oh you ought to know about these people folks
[1:04:42.400 --> 1:04:44.400]  they're incredible they are a Satan cult
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:46.400]  but they're all wimps they just want to hurt kids
[1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:48.400]  and then they all act powerful though
[1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:50.400]  and Brennan's in there seething like a demon
[1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:52.400]  in front of him like
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:54.400]  oh I'm powerful I'm somebody
[1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:56.400]  no you're not Brennan you're going to hell
[1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:01.400]  in full wars life has done it again
[1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:04.400]  with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet
[1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:07.400]  super silver whitening
[1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:09.400]  toothpaste this is proprietary
[1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:11.400]  this is with the top lab in the country
[1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:13.400]  and it is incredibly high quality
[1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:15.400]  this is the best toothpaste
[1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:17.400]  you're going to find
[1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:19.400]  it's called whitening toothpaste
[1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:21.400]  but really it knocks out the bacteria
[1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:23.400]  it recalcifies the teeth
[1:05:23.400 --> 1:05:25.400]  it does so many things on so many fronts
[1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:27.400]  these beautiful tubes
[1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:29.400]  of super silver toothpaste
[1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:31.400]  are available at an introductory price
[1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:33.400]  of 25% off out of the gates
[1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:35.400]  it's as low as we can go
[1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:37.400]  and they're going to sell out very very quickly
[1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:39.400]  super silver whitening toothpaste
[1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:41.400]  is going to be a hit
[1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:43.400]  I'm very very proud of it
[1:05:43.400 --> 1:05:45.400]  I want to thank my father a retired dentist
[1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:47.400]  for spearheading this
[1:05:47.400 --> 1:05:49.400]  the last two years and developing it
[1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:51.400]  it's 25% off out of the gates
[1:05:51.400 --> 1:05:53.400]  that's as low as we can go
[1:05:53.400 --> 1:05:55.400]  because it's very very expensive to produce
[1:05:55.400 --> 1:06:09.400]  please visit www.infowarslife.com
[1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:35.400]  I've got to look outside again
[1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:55.400]  and wonder where I've gone
[1:06:55.400 --> 1:06:59.400]  thank you for joining us on this November 17, 2019
[1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:01.400]  global transmission
[1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:03.400]  I'm your host Alex Jones
[1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:05.400]  we're going to have constitutional lawyer
[1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:07.400]  Robert Barnes on and Roger Stone's
[1:07:07.400 --> 1:07:09.400]  personal lawyer
[1:07:09.400 --> 1:07:11.400]  Howard Nixon on as well
[1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:13.400]  here in just a moment to talk about
[1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:15.400]  the draconian
[1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:17.400]  show trial
[1:07:17.400 --> 1:07:19.400]  that we just saw complete its course
[1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:21.400]  on Friday
[1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:23.400]  we'll be breaking it all down
[1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:25.400]  here in just a moment
[1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:27.400]  but first off
[1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:31.400]  there were some stories
[1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:33.400]  on Friday
[1:07:33.400 --> 1:07:35.400]  that I meant to get to on the show
[1:07:35.400 --> 1:07:37.400]  and then after the broadcast
[1:07:37.400 --> 1:07:39.400]  I looked at the news and I went and did some more research
[1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:41.400]  and I just thought I've got to bring this
[1:07:41.400 --> 1:07:43.400]  to the people
[1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:45.400]  I've got to talk about this on air
[1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:47.400]  look at this headline
[1:07:47.400 --> 1:07:49.400]  plastic additives stress
[1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:51.400]  during late pregnancy
[1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:53.400]  boost risk of premature birth
[1:07:53.400 --> 1:07:55.400]  and then it goes into the additives
[1:07:55.400 --> 1:07:57.400]  in synthetic skin creams
[1:07:57.400 --> 1:07:59.400]  and women's products
[1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:01.400]  this is in major studies
[1:08:01.400 --> 1:08:03.400]  that
[1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:05.400]  are
[1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:07.400]  triggering
[1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:09.400]  early birth
[1:08:09.400 --> 1:08:11.400]  and the death of many children
[1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:13.400]  and you can go read the big studies
[1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:15.400]  that have come out breaking all of this down
[1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:17.400]  now we've talked about
[1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:19.400]  this for a long time
[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:21.400]  this is from the occupational health science institutes
[1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:23.400]  and it shows
[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:25.400]  just how deadly this is
[1:08:25.400 --> 1:08:27.400]  how estrogen mimickers
[1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:29.400]  in
[1:08:29.400 --> 1:08:31.400]  products are just wrecking
[1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:33.400]  women and wrecking their babies
[1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:35.400]  and we know they're wrecking men
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:37.400]  they're causing all sorts of massive
[1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:39.400]  health problems there as well
[1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:41.400]  but when I talk about this
[1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:43.400]  it just becomes a big joke
[1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:45.400]  even though I can show you a stack of studies
[1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:47.400]  that it's making
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:49.400]  not just
[1:08:49.400 --> 1:08:51.400]  frogs
[1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:53.400]  not just fish
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:55.400]  but also mammals
[1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:57.400]  and insects with the same species
[1:08:57.400 --> 1:08:59.400]  now the globalists know exactly
[1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:01.400]  what they're doing
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:03.400]  and it turns out they've got white papers out
[1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:05.400]  in the 60's admitting this whole plan
[1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:07.400]  so you see the feminization of men
[1:09:07.400 --> 1:09:09.400]  and you go out in public everywhere
[1:09:09.400 --> 1:09:11.400]  and the men act more like women than women do
[1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:13.400]  and are all scrawny
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:15.400]  and chicken-necked and have lisping voices
[1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:17.400]  and you say what the hell happened here
[1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:19.400]  well it's been a chemical warfare
[1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:21.400]  program
[1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:23.400]  so that's out of Rudger's University
[1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:25.400]  researchers working
[1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:27.400]  on food-based treatments
[1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:29.400]  to slow aging, science daily
[1:09:29.400 --> 1:09:31.400]  goes into a whole bunch of foods
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:33.400]  that are known to actually work better
[1:09:33.400 --> 1:09:35.400]  than drugs at slowing aging
[1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:37.400]  and helping people, well yeah what do you think is in them
[1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:39.400]  that's what gets taken out of those foods
[1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:41.400]  and put into supplements
[1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:43.400]  medicines pose global environmental risk
[1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:45.400]  experts warn, Yahoo News
[1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:47.400]  French news agency
[1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:49.400]  massive runoff
[1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:51.400]  and the UN
[1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:53.400]  even admitting this
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:55.400]  in the global food chain is causing
[1:09:55.400 --> 1:09:57.400]  all sorts of human sicknesses
[1:09:57.400 --> 1:09:59.400]  animal plant sicknesses
[1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:01.400]  including
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:03.400]  quote making the frogs gay
[1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:05.400]  the male frogs want to have sex
[1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:07.400]  with male frogs and there's no babies
[1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:09.400]  and the frogs die, it's cute when humans
[1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:11.400]  all die, I know we're bad and you need to go away
[1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:13.400]  but this is happening
[1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:15.400]  ladies and gentlemen, across species
[1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:17.400]  antidepressants
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:19.400]  in the water making shrimp suicidal
[1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:21.400]  chemicals in the water
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:23.400]  altered gender of fish
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:25.400]  CBS News
[1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:27.400]  Prozac pollution
[1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:29.400]  again making animals commit suicide
[1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:31.400]  it's designed to
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:33.400]  now let's get into the facts here
[1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:35.400]  you need to filter your water
[1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:37.400]  with high quality water filtration systems
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.400]  we have the best
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:41.400]  highest rated gravity systems from
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:43.400]  ProPure, Anilexapure
[1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:45.400]  and InfoWarsTour.com
[1:10:45.400 --> 1:10:47.400]  David Hogg calls it a conspiracy theory
[1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:49.400]  that I say the water's got
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:51.400]  toxins in it, you better filter it
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:53.400]  and then I sell water filters
[1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:55.400]  that'd be like if you were about to
[1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:57.400]  go gold prospecting
[1:10:57.400 --> 1:10:59.400]  you got off a ship from San Francisco
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:01.400]  in Alaska in the summer
[1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:03.400]  you're about to go inland for the next year
[1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:05.400]  and try to find gold, I'd say
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:07.400]  you better buy some really thick clothing
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:09.400]  and the right boots and everything
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:11.400]  or you're gonna die, you better get a high powered rifle

[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:23.400]  and water in your water tank
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:25.400]  before you try to drive
[1:11:25.400 --> 1:11:27.400]  across Shade Death Valley
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:29.400]  yes I'd have a gas station right at the entrance
[1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:31.400]  to it and I'd say better fill up
[1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:33.400]  on water and gas
[1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:35.400]  and get some cold Coca-Cola while you're at it
[1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:37.400]  yes exactly or if I live by a lake
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:39.400]  and I own a shop selling fishing lures
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:41.400]  I'd want to sell the best fishing lures
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:43.400]  cause I want you to buy from me
[1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:45.400]  cause you need it if you're going fishing
[1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:49.400]  so what are the benefits of CoQ10
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:51.400]  and I'm gonna get more into this in the coming days
[1:11:53.400 --> 1:11:55.400]  and you look at this information
[1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:57.400]  from up above with the camera
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:11:59.400]  and you can see what are the benefits
[1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:01.400]  of CoQ10
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:03.400]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:12:03.400 --> 1:12:05.400]  and then it goes over it all right here
[1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:07.400]  people that have heart attacks
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:09.400]  it makes
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:11.400]  the tissue grow back
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:13.400]  PQQ
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:15.400]  all of it this is what's in
[1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:17.400]  DNA Force Plus and it's what counteract
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:19.400]  so much of what's going on
[1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:21.400]  generate fresh mitochondria with PQQ
[1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:23.400]  that's out of major studies go read it
[1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:25.400]  and it goes on and on
[1:12:25.400 --> 1:12:27.400]  and on and that's how we fund ourselves
[1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:29.400]  with the best formula of PQQ
[1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:31.400]  and CoQ10
[1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:33.400]  that you're gonna find out there absolutely
[1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:35.400]  anywhere
[1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:37.400]  in DNA Force Plus
[1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:39.400]  and then it's got a bunch of other
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:41.400]  natural ingredients that supercharge the PQQ
[1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:43.400]  and the CoQ10
[1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:45.400]  and get it across the cellular
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:47.400]  membrane levels into your cells
[1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:49.400]  and into your brain when you research
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:51.400]  CoQ10 and PQQ particularly
[1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:53.400]  it's known to regrow
[1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:55.400]  mitochondria in the brain cells
[1:12:55.400 --> 1:12:57.400]  but nothing else will
[1:12:57.400 --> 1:12:59.400]  and yes you could eat 50 crates of blueberries
[1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:01.400]  to get the same amount of these compounds
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:03.400]  you'll get in DNA Force
[1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:05.400]  but you can't do that can you

[1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:19.400]  we didn't just warn you about all this before it was mainstream news
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:21.400]  we told you about PQQ before
[1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:23.400]  it was all the rage 5 years ago
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:25.400]  now it's all the rage
[1:13:25.400 --> 1:13:27.400]  because we knew it was already all the rage in Japan
[1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:29.400]  20 years ago or 15 years ago
[1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:31.400]  this is it

[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:39.400]  that make the broadcast possible
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:41.400]  okay let's shift gears down and go to Robert Barnes
[1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:43.400]  Robert
[1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:45.400]  what is your view
[1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:47.400]  what is your take on what we saw happen to Roger Stone
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:49.400]  on Friday
[1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:51.400]  and I know you're concerned about it
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:53.400]  and what's happened to the judicial system
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:55.400]  I mean it's terrifying
[1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:57.400]  there is a report out today
[1:13:57.400 --> 1:13:59.400]  apparently by Michael Caputo
[1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:01.400]  on Twitter
[1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:03.400]  that Dave identified one of the key
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:05.400]  jurors
[1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:07.400]  in the case as being a former Democratic candidate
[1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:09.400]  for Congress
[1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:11.400]  who had prior experience as a jury foreman
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:13.400]  it's not clear whether or not that information
[1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:15.400]  was known to Stone's defense
[1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:17.400]  what's problematic is this is what arises
[1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:19.400]  when
[1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:21.400]  a judge orders a jury's
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:23.400]  identities to stay secret
[1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:25.400]  it's what happens when former Obama prosecutors threaten
[1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:27.400]  people like yourself
[1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:29.400]  with arrest and criminal prosecution
[1:14:29.400 --> 1:14:31.400]  for merely talking about potential issues
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:33.400]  of juror bias
[1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:35.400]  it's what happens when the media smears
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:37.400]  anyone like they did you
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:39.400]  for talking about issues of jury bias
[1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:41.400]  it's the reason why courts have generally said
[1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:43.400]  jurors identities should not be anonymous
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:45.400]  they're public officials taking
[1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:47.400]  governmental action
[1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:49.400]  on behalf of the broader populace
[1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:51.400]  and often it requires their identities be fully disclosed
[1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:53.400]  so that independent grassroots investigators
[1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:55.400]  can do their own investigation as to whether or not
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:57.400]  there was any
[1:14:57.400 --> 1:14:59.400]  misrepresentations in the jury selection process
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:01.400]  whether or not there was jury bias
[1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:03.400]  in the jury selection process
[1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:05.400]  whether or not Roger Stone was tried
[1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:07.400]  by an impartial and fair jury
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:09.400]  it appears at this juncture
[1:15:09.400 --> 1:15:11.400]  that Roger Stone did not receive the benefits
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:13.400]  of an impartial fair jury
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:15.400]  in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:17.400]  to the U.S. Constitution
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:19.400]  but right now the only likely remedy he will receive
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:21.400]  is if the president takes action on this
[1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:23.400]  and pardons him as he should
[1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:25.400]  to correct the imbalance in our criminal justice system
[1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:27.400]  the left
[1:15:27.400 --> 1:15:29.400]  is already calling for my arrest
[1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:31.400]  we confirmed in Friday's hearing
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:33.400]  we'll talk about that some as well because
[1:15:33.400 --> 1:15:35.400]  this is just really really getting out of control
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:37.400]  and
[1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:39.400]  they're also saying Trump better not pardon Stone
[1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:41.400]  because it will show Russia collusion
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:43.400]  he was indicted as you know and convicted on process crimes
[1:15:43.400 --> 1:15:45.400]  nothing to do with Russia
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:47.400]  so that hoax is falling apart as well
[1:15:47.400 --> 1:15:49.400]  Robert Barnes is our guest
[1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:51.400]  he'll be joined in the next segment
[1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:53.400]  by Tyler Nixon that's Stone's personal lawyer
[1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:55.400]  he's not a confidant
[1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:57.400]  not a lawyer on the case
[1:15:57.400 --> 1:15:59.400]  that's critical to understand
[1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:01.400]  because he would be so much different
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:03.400]  in civil wars presents the Alex Jones show
[1:16:03.400 --> 1:16:05.400]  you supporting the broadcast over the years
[1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:07.400]  is why we're still here
[1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:09.400]  so that's why you spreading the word is so critical
[1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:11.400]  and that's why buying the products is critical
[1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:13.400]  because these are great products you already want and need
[1:16:13.400 --> 1:16:15.400]  and then you literally couldn't
[1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:17.400]  thumb your nose at the globalist more
[1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:19.400]  by holding us up against their onslaught
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:21.400]  it's amazing
[1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:23.400]  I just haven't done it because we're selling out a lot of stuff
[1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:25.400]  we've already had big specials I don't know how else
[1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:27.400]  I'm supposed to have big specials

[1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:01.400]  about a month ago
[1:18:01.400 --> 1:18:03.400]  President Trump announced
[1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:05.400]  that he was going to move his domicile
[1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:07.400]  from New York City to Florida
[1:18:07.400 --> 1:18:09.400]  where he's always said he planned to retire
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:11.400]  to and the left got so
[1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:13.400]  excited they said
[1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:15.400]  oh he's about to resign
[1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:17.400]  and leave instead of
[1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:19.400]  facing impeachment and he's running
[1:18:19.400 --> 1:18:21.400]  to Florida
[1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:23.400]  well now we know why the president did that
[1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:25.400]  he knew the left is controlled
[1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:27.400]  appeals courts we're going to say that he had to give up
[1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:29.400]  his tax returns
[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:31.400]  so they can pour over them and harass every business
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:33.400]  partner he's got
[1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:35.400]  they want to terrorize people
[1:18:35.400 --> 1:18:37.400]  that he's worked with
[1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:39.400]  and by moving his domicile from New York
[1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:41.400]  to Florida that gets around the New York
[1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:43.400]  law they passed
[1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:45.400]  to get his tax returns
[1:18:45.400 --> 1:18:47.400]  that are supposed to be private
[1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:49.400]  so all those people out there holding their breath
[1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:51.400]  for the president to resign
[1:18:51.400 --> 1:18:53.400]  in his words
[1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:55.400]  we're kicking the deep state's ass
[1:18:55.400 --> 1:18:57.400]  and he's never going to resign
[1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:01.400]  Beto Rourke came out
[1:19:01.400 --> 1:19:03.400]  dozens of times and said
[1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:05.400]  we're going to confiscate all your semiautomatic rifles
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:07.400]  and he got all the other Democrats
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:09.400]  on the stage nine others to agree
[1:19:09.400 --> 1:19:11.400]  and said that he was a hero
[1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:13.400]  think about that
[1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:15.400]  now those Democrats have taken all the guns
[1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:17.400]  in the cities they control
[1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:19.400]  their blue cities are literal crap holes
[1:19:19.400 --> 1:19:21.400]  covered with needles
[1:19:21.400 --> 1:19:23.400]  and with massive drug dealing
[1:19:23.400 --> 1:19:25.400]  and incredible levels of violent crime
[1:19:25.400 --> 1:19:27.400]  they know what they're doing
[1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:29.400]  and now the supreme courts
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:31.400]  come out and ruled that gun manufacturers
[1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:33.400]  can be sued into oblivion
[1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:35.400]  for what criminals do using their firearms
[1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:37.400]  my goodness ladies and gentlemen
[1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:39.400]  this country is under such incredible attack
[1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:41.400]  but more and more
[1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:43.400]  towns and cities are saying
[1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:45.400]  they're sanctuaries for the second amendment
[1:19:45.400 --> 1:19:47.400]  and they're going to follow the original bill of rights
[1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:49.400]  and constitution and they're not
[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:51.400]  going to help in the confiscation of guns
[1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:54.400]  so you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens
[1:19:54.400 --> 1:20:08.400]  well we can ignore all your unconstitutional laws
[1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:26.400]  Robert Barnes is a smart lawyer
[1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:28.400]  a friend of mine also
[1:20:28.400 --> 1:20:30.400]  a historian of Americana
[1:20:30.400 --> 1:20:32.400]  and we're going to get back into the
[1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:34.400]  really frightening conviction of Roger Stone
[1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:36.400]  the sickening celebrations by the left
[1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:38.400]  and others about it
[1:20:38.400 --> 1:20:40.400]  and we're going to get his lawyer on here in just a moment
[1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:42.400]  Tyler Nixon
[1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:44.400]  and talk about the
[1:20:44.400 --> 1:20:46.400]  course the president really has to take
[1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:48.400]  on this is very very clear
[1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:50.400]  but separately
[1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:52.400]  what do you make of
[1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:54.400]  Mar, Bill Mar
[1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:56.400]  we talk about during the break
[1:20:56.400 --> 1:20:58.400]  we're aware of it and Obama
[1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:00.400]  and others saying we don't want a civil war
[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:02.400]  America needs to come together this is dangerous
[1:21:02.400 --> 1:21:04.400]  when the big foundations
[1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:06.400]  and big money that they work for
[1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:08.400]  they know damn well have been orchestrating
[1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:10.400]  this divide and conquer and this attempt
[1:21:10.400 --> 1:21:12.400]  at race war and sex war and class war
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:14.400]  why do you think with
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:16.400]  351 days after the election
[1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:18.400]  they're putting this out
[1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:20.400]  officially everywhere so they can
[1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:22.400]  have plausible deniability
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:24.400]  when the violence they've already sung the seeds for
[1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:26.400]  comes a fruition and germinates
[1:21:26.400 --> 1:21:28.400]  or is it because
[1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:30.400]  they're planning false flags
[1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:32.400]  and want to distance themselves ahead of that
[1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:34.400]  because this is clearly a talking point
[1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:36.400]  they're putting out
[1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:38.400]  no doubt I mean I think there's been a
[1:21:38.400 --> 1:21:40.400]  weaponization of the legal system
[1:21:40.400 --> 1:21:42.400]  and institutional sources of power
[1:21:42.400 --> 1:21:44.400]  whether it be the deep states attempt at a
[1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:46.400]  second coup through their bogus impeachment
[1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:48.400]  instigation
[1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:50.400]  which you've seen in courts
[1:21:50.400 --> 1:21:52.400]  from DC to San Francisco just this week
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:54.400]  so you had Attorney General Barr
[1:21:54.400 --> 1:21:56.400]  speaking about how the courts are being weaponized
[1:21:56.400 --> 1:21:58.400]  in a politicized partisan way
[1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:00.400]  and issuing orders that they had never issued before
[1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:02.400]  that's what Attorney General Barr
[1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:04.400]  was talking about
[1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:06.400]  then in the same week we see a criminal
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:08.400]  trial that makes a mockery out of the criminal
[1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:10.400]  justice system in the prosecution
[1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:12.400]  and conviction of Roger Stone
[1:22:12.400 --> 1:22:14.400]  and we see a parallel
[1:22:14.400 --> 1:22:16.400]  prosecution that's politically motivated
[1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:18.400]  by Planned Parenthood in a civil suit
[1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:20.400]  in the Northern District of California
[1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:22.400]  ordering undercover journalists to pay
[1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:24.400]  close to a million dollars simply for
[1:22:24.400 --> 1:22:26.400]  exposing the truth about what Planned Parenthood
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:28.400]  and its associated groups were part of
[1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:30.400]  so when that's happening
[1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:32.400]  the institutional threat
[1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:34.400]  to conservatives and to those on the right
[1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:36.400]  is reaching a level
[1:22:36.400 --> 1:22:38.400]  that's being paralleled by the
[1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:40.400]  politically motivated violence
[1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:42.400]  by groups like Antifa
[1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:44.400]  and others calling for it
[1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:46.400]  that suggests the left will lose
[1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:48.400]  control over the
[1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:50.400]  tiger that they're riding
[1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:52.400]  as the old
[1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:54.400]  statement back at the time of the revolution
[1:22:54.400 --> 1:22:56.400]  he said always be careful about riding a tiger
[1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:58.400]  that the tiger doesn't eat you in the process
[1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:00.400]  talking about the key needs of maintaining
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:02.400]  and sustaining the revolutionary troops
[1:23:02.400 --> 1:23:04.400]  in a way that they didn't lose control over
[1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:06.400]  over time in the way the French Revolution
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:08.400]  and the Russian Revolution both exposed
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:10.400]  when they ultimately ate their own
[1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:12.400]  and so I think members of what I would call
[1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:14.400]  left which Obama represents
[1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:16.400]  which Bill Maher to a large degree
[1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:18.400]  represents realize the dangers
[1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:20.400]  of unleashing
[1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:22.400]  the leftist violence
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:24.400]  in such a way when they're doing it
[1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:26.400]  at an institutional level
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:28.400]  suppressing conservatives across the
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:30.400]  board in the legal space that that's going
[1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:32.400]  to backfire in a way that they can't
[1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:34.400]  control or contain
[1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:36.400]  and I think they've left the young
[1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:38.400]  left out in a way that's going to be
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:40.400]  hard to pull back or withdraw
[1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:42.400]  and they're seeing it from the radicalization
[1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:44.400]  of positions taken by
[1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:46.400]  before identified moderate Democratic
[1:23:46.400 --> 1:23:48.400]  candidates for the presidency
[1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:50.400]  they're seeing it in that the courts
[1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:52.400]  are going so far
[1:23:52.400 --> 1:23:54.400]  that everybody can see what's happening is
[1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:56.400]  political and partisan and ultimately
[1:23:56.400 --> 1:23:58.400]  like take for example the institutional power of the courts
[1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:00.400]  that that power is heavily predicated
[1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:02.400]  on the public's belief
[1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:04.400]  that the court systems are being fair
[1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:06.400]  and applying the rule of law
[1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:08.400]  and being impartial and apolitical
[1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:10.400]  when you have cases like Roger
[1:24:10.400 --> 1:24:12.400]  Stone where the defendant is gagged
[1:24:12.400 --> 1:24:14.400]  where the jury selection appears to be
[1:24:14.400 --> 1:24:16.400]  rigged in favor of the Democratic side of the
[1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:18.400]  aisle and to and to lynch him effectively
[1:24:18.400 --> 1:24:20.400]  where things are kept secret and anonymous
[1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:22.400]  from the public so that they can't engage
[1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:24.400]  when they put the life of a
[1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:26.400]  Mueller probe lawyer on
[1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:28.400]  the jury and we expose it
[1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:30.400]  and they call for our arrest and it just shows
[1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:32.400]  they will try anything
[1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:34.400]  you're absolutely right I want to bring
[1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:36.400]  Tyler Nixon in here
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:38.400]  who is of course a family friend
[1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:40.400]  and personal lawyer of Stone not his lawyer
[1:24:40.400 --> 1:24:42.400]  in the criminal trial though he was there
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:44.400]  for the almost two weeks of it
[1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:46.400]  I know you've learned a lot
[1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:48.400]  since then I know you've talked to others
[1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:50.400]  and what you can talk about now
[1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:52.400]  we talked briefly earlier today via text
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:54.400]  you said that it's just incredible
[1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:56.400]  the misjustice and the things
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:24:58.400]  that went on can you chronicle eyes
[1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:00.400]  that for us and then we'll come back
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:02.400]  and flesh more of it out with Barnes Robert Barnes
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:04.400]  with us Tyler Nixon about just
[1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:06.400]  to quantify you know sum up
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:08.400]  kind of the rap sheet of here of what you saw
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:10.400]  sure well Bob Barnes
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:12.400]  is spot on as always he
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:14.400]  really just talked about how
[1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:16.400]  the left does not care at this point
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:18.400]  what goes down on flames
[1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:20.400]  or what institutions and your core
[1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:22.400]  fundamental human rights they
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:24.400]  violate and begin to erode
[1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:26.400]  if they don't have power
[1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:28.400]  they'd rather burn it all down
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:30.400]  now as a libertarian hey you know
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:32.400]  burn it take it all with you as far as I'm concerned
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:34.400]  but you know there's a lot of victims
[1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:36.400]  in the process as we know
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:38.400]  from history you know from 100 millions
[1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:40.400]  dead over the 20th century
[1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:42.400]  but exactly Obama realizes
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:44.400]  they have bully people on colleges
[1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:46.400]  anti for hit women that have bike locks
[1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:48.400]  but now they're trying to arrest and intimidate congress
[1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:50.400]  I mean I think Obama
[1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:52.400]  feels the rumblings that they haven't scared us
[1:25:52.400 --> 1:25:54.400]  it didn't intimidate us that it's pissing
[1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:56.400]  people off that we're organizing
[1:25:56.400 --> 1:25:58.400]  yeah and I think you both
[1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:00.400]  you would understand that when they're engaging
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:02.400]  of just absolute hypocrisy
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:04.400]  openly you know accusing
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:06.400]  I mean the Biden situation
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:08.400]  with the Ukraine call and him
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:10.400]  you know having the prosecutor
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:12.400]  removed and then Trump
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:14.400]  trying to investigate that suddenly becomes
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:16.400]  you know obstruction of justice
[1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:18.400]  when they can openly do the same
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:20.400]  behavior and they're righteous
[1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:22.400]  and we're criminals for it then you know
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:24.400]  you're really you're really getting to the edge
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:26.400]  of the system being just an outright
[1:26:26.400 --> 1:26:28.400]  but let's be clear Tyler it's not the same
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:30.400]  thing Trump said he's going after corruption
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:32.400]  under a treaty that's his job
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:34.400]  Biden Biden saying
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:36.400]  I said fire that son of a bitch
[1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:38.400]  you don't get a billion dollars he was fired a few
[1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:40.400]  hours later that's open pissing
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:42.400]  on our face criminal
[1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:44.400]  to break our will
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:46.400]  no it you're right you actually
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.400]  put a finer point on it because
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:50.400]  really Biden's criminality
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:52.400]  compared to Trump's you know seeking
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:54.400]  actual justice
[1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:56.400]  and seeking investigation is
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:26:58.400]  you know Biden's excuse Trump's a criminal
[1:26:58.400 --> 1:27:00.400]  so again it's that it's here's the standard
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:02.400]  when Republican or excuse me when Democrats
[1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:04.400]  commit crimes it's just politics
[1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:06.400]  when Republicans do politics
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:08.400]  it's crime and that's exactly
[1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:10.400]  what the standard they want to you know to have
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:12.400]  to going forward so you know they can do
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:14.400]  anything they want Adam Schiff can
[1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:16.400]  do what he did on the intelligence
[1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:18.400]  committee which is play games leak things
[1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:20.400]  he can violate the rules along with his fellow
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:22.400]  Democrat running around naked
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:24.400]  like pirates with their hair on fire
[1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:26.400]  so as we're gonna go come back to you
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:28.400]  on the other side next I want to get into
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:30.400]  Stone's trial what you can reveal
[1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:32.400]  you know course of action
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:34.400]  here and what you witness in there
[1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:36.400]  but Barnes I think there's
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:38.400]  a realization in the establishment that
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:40.400]  they've gotten out of control themselves
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:42.400]  and that they're gonna lose I mean I
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:44.400]  think I think they've irrevocably
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:46.400]  damaged the deep state by revealing
[1:27:46.400 --> 1:27:48.400]  themselves and I don't think they can ever put it back
[1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:50.400]  together again oh that's the
[1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:52.400]  beauty of the election
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:54.400]  of President Trump
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:56.400]  is that it unveiled and revealed
[1:27:56.400 --> 1:27:58.400]  and forced the deep state to come out
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:00.400]  of operation forced the media to expose the scale
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:02.400]  and scope and severity of their bias
[1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:04.400]  forced the leftist and the judiciary
[1:28:04.400 --> 1:28:06.400]  to reveal the degree to which they would rule
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:08.400]  and openly partisan in politicized ways
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:10.400]  so I think that's the beauty and
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:12.400]  brilliance of Trump whatever anyone thinks of him
[1:28:12.400 --> 1:28:14.400]  is that he exposes the opposition for who they are
[1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:16.400]  and what they are and I think people like
[1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:18.400]  Obama who's an institutional leftist
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:20.400]  it recognizes that this is
[1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:22.400]  problematic that Trump is in fact
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:24.400]  winning the long-term public relations
[1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:26.400]  debate the left is being exposed
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:28.400]  in a radicalized way. That's right Obama's like
[1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:30.400]  we already had America tied up in the basement
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:32.400]  raping the hell out of it like the children we kidnap
[1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:34.400]  literally why have we done this to Trump
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:36.400]  it's only opening up we got kids in the basement
[1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:38.400]  here we had this country on
[1:28:38.400 --> 1:28:40.400]  its frickin knees we're gonna take our time
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:42.400]  sucking its blood
[1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:44.400]  like $65,000 worth of hot dogs
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:46.400]  Obama gets delivered to his hotel room
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:48.400]  those aren't hot dogs folks those are
[1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:50.400]  those are male prostitutes which is fine
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:52.400]  at least you don't have any children you know
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:54.400]  they ride back on the other side stay with us
[1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:00.400]  there's a famous quote by
[1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:02.400]  Marine Corps general in the Korean
[1:29:02.400 --> 1:29:04.400]  war when 3 million
[1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:06.400]  Chai comms had flooded across the border
[1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:08.400]  and surrounded the Marines
[1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:10.400]  more than
[1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:12.400]  50 to 1 some estimates have it
[1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:14.400]  but the point is they were outnumbered
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:16.400]  and the general
[1:29:16.400 --> 1:29:18.400]  was told general were completely surrounded
[1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:20.400]  he said good we can attack
[1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:22.400]  in all directions
[1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:24.400]  well that's the point that info wars
[1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:26.400]  has reached
[1:29:26.400 --> 1:29:28.400]  and it really is epic it really is
[1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:30.400]  biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far
[1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:32.400]  without all your support
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:34.400]  but it's gonna become more critical
[1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:36.400]  than ever as
[1:29:36.400 --> 1:29:38.400]  the censorship becomes complete
[1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:40.400]  and it's not just Americans
[1:29:40.400 --> 1:29:42.400]  but folks all over the world are completely silenced
[1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:44.400]  when it comes to speaking
[1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:46.400]  in the name of a CIA fake whistleblower
[1:29:46.400 --> 1:29:48.400]  or exposing a pedophile
[1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:50.400]  or speaking out against
[1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:52.400]  dangerous vaccines
[1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:54.400]  because by info wars having its own platform
[1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:56.400]  that checkmates the globalist
[1:30:00.400 --> 1:30:02.400]  a question was once posed to
[1:30:02.400 --> 1:30:04.400]  Thomas Jefferson
[1:30:04.400 --> 1:30:06.400]  what is the level
[1:30:06.400 --> 1:30:08.400]  of tyranny
[1:30:08.400 --> 1:30:10.400]  that a tyrant will take humanity to
[1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:12.400]  how far will they go
[1:30:12.400 --> 1:30:14.400]  what's their limit
[1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:16.400]  and he said it is the limit to which
[1:30:16.400 --> 1:30:18.400]  other men and women
[1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:20.400]  will submit
[1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:22.400]  the answer is there is no limit
[1:30:22.400 --> 1:30:24.400]  to evil it is a
[1:30:24.400 --> 1:30:26.400]  bottomless pit
[1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:28.400]  we've been taught in modern culture
[1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:30.400]  and society that evil doesn't
[1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:32.400]  exist
[1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:34.400]  or that there's no free will
[1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:36.400]  there's no devil or the god
[1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:38.400]  but those very same people have all these rules
[1:30:38.400 --> 1:30:40.400]  for us about speech
[1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:42.400]  how we can dress
[1:30:42.400 --> 1:30:44.400]  and where we can live
[1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:46.400]  and what our houses can be like
[1:30:46.400 --> 1:30:48.400]  they just don't want us to have any values
[1:30:48.400 --> 1:30:50.400]  so they can run over us
[1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:52.400]  oxford's band clapping
[1:30:52.400 --> 1:30:54.400]  universities in the US have banned 21 guns
[1:30:54.400 --> 1:30:56.400]  salutes for veterans
[1:30:56.400 --> 1:30:58.400]  these people are dangerous cult leaders
[1:30:58.400 --> 1:31:00.400]  and it's time to reject them
[1:31:00.400 --> 1:31:02.400]  the globalists know that I will never
[1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:04.400]  willingly give up
[1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:06.400]  I've said it many times I will never give in
[1:31:06.400 --> 1:31:08.400]  I will never give up
[1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:10.400]  I will never give out
[1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:12.400]  and it's very very frustrating
[1:31:12.400 --> 1:31:14.400]  to see them committing all their crimes
[1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:16.400]  against humanity
[1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:18.400]  to see evil running rampant like this
[1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:20.400]  and to know
[1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:22.400]  that most Americans have already been silenced
[1:31:22.400 --> 1:31:24.400]  in cyberspace
[1:31:24.400 --> 1:31:26.400]  that most Americans have already been shadow banned
[1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:28.400]  by big tech
[1:31:28.400 --> 1:31:30.400]  and to know that most Americans
[1:31:30.400 --> 1:31:32.400]  feel powerless and don't realize
[1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:34.400]  how much power they have
[1:31:34.400 --> 1:31:36.400]  by spreading the word
[1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:38.400]  infowars.com
[1:31:38.400 --> 1:31:40.400]  infowars.com and band.video
[1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:42.400]  and that people are hungry for the truth
[1:31:42.400 --> 1:31:44.400]  now more than ever and that if you tell people
[1:31:44.400 --> 1:31:46.400]  hey the band truth they don't want you to have
[1:31:46.400 --> 1:31:48.400]  is at infowars.com
[1:31:48.400 --> 1:31:50.400]  forward slash show and band.video
[1:31:50.400 --> 1:31:52.400]  so take heart folks
[1:31:52.400 --> 1:31:54.400]  they've had to censor everybody to show everybody down
[1:31:54.400 --> 1:31:56.400]  because the truth is powerful
[1:31:56.400 --> 1:31:58.400]  and they can't beat us fair and square
[1:32:00.400 --> 1:32:02.400]  about a month ago president trump
[1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:04.400]  announced that he was going to move
[1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:06.400]  from a missile from new york city
[1:32:06.400 --> 1:32:08.400]  to florida where he's always said
[1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:10.400]  he planned to retire to and the left
[1:32:10.400 --> 1:32:12.400]  got so excited
[1:32:12.400 --> 1:32:14.400]  they said oh he's
[1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:16.400]  about to resign and leave
[1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:18.400]  instead of facing impeachment
[1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:20.400]  and he's running to florida
[1:32:20.400 --> 1:32:22.400]  well now we know why the president
[1:32:22.400 --> 1:32:24.400]  did that he knew the left
[1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:26.400]  is controlled appeals courts we're going to say
[1:32:26.400 --> 1:32:28.400]  that he had to give up his tax returns
[1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:30.400]  so they can pour over them and harass
[1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:32.400]  every business partner he's
[1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:34.400]  got they want to terrorize
[1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:36.400]  people that he's worked with
[1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:38.400]  and by moving his domicile
[1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:40.400]  from new york to florida that gets around
[1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:42.400]  the new york law they passed
[1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:44.400]  to get his tax
[1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:46.400]  returns that are supposed to be private
[1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:48.400]  so all those people out there
[1:32:48.400 --> 1:32:50.400]  holding their breath for the president
[1:32:50.400 --> 1:32:52.400]  to resign in his words
[1:32:52.400 --> 1:32:54.400]  we're kicking the deep states
[1:32:54.400 --> 1:32:56.400]  ass and he's never gonna
[1:32:56.400 --> 1:33:02.400]  resign
[1:33:02.400 --> 1:33:30.400]  the alex jones show
[1:33:32.400 --> 1:33:34.400]  we are back ladies and gentlemen
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:36.400]  we got one more second with our guest
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:38.400]  and I'm going to get into the control grid
[1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:40.400]  really what the internet really is
[1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:42.400]  at really a fascinating level
[1:33:42.400 --> 1:33:44.400]  but
[1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:46.400]  constitutional lawyer criminal lawyer
[1:33:46.400 --> 1:33:48.400]  Robert barnes looking in from the outside
[1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:50.400]  studying the news of what's happening
[1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:52.400]  and we've got tower next to him
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:54.400]  and he's going to get into the control grid
[1:33:54.400 --> 1:33:56.400]  and he's going to get into the control grid
[1:33:56.400 --> 1:33:58.400]  and he's going to get into the control grid
[1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:00.400]  really what the internet really is
[1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:02.400]  what's happening
[1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:04.400]  we've got tower next to him who was there
[1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:06.400]  for the trial
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:08.400]  I wanted to ask Tyler
[1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:10.400]  because I know I diverted us off
[1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:12.400]  and all the civil war talk
[1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:14.400]  and the attorney general talking about how
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:16.400]  the civil war was in the government
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:18.400]  to try to stop the executive branch
[1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:20.400]  and the election, the will of the people
[1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:22.400]  which we've been saying obviously for three plus years
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:24.400]  it's just incredible to have all this out in
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:26.400]  the open now and that's a whole other
[1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:28.400]  discussion we should have
[1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:35.540]  and his ongoing gag order and all the things that have happened, and the judge attempting
[1:34:35.540 --> 1:34:39.140]  to extend that gag order to me to not talk about the jurors she was putting on there
[1:34:39.140 --> 1:34:45.900]  that are obviously, yes, should be disqualified because of conflicts, other things that you
[1:34:45.900 --> 1:34:53.380]  can talk about and that you witnessed during this kangaroo event, Tyler Nixon.
[1:34:53.380 --> 1:35:01.380]  Alright, we've probably lost Nixon there, that's fine, let's get to Robert Barnes'
[1:35:01.380 --> 1:35:02.380]  take on that.
[1:35:02.380 --> 1:35:07.340]  Robert, continuing, you heard those questions, I mean, people are shocked by this, they're
[1:35:07.340 --> 1:35:08.340]  angry.
[1:35:08.340 --> 1:35:11.980]  Well, I think what people witnessed is how the criminal justice system operates in politicized
[1:35:11.980 --> 1:35:17.140]  cases, but mostly those cases are usually kept below the political radar.
[1:35:17.140 --> 1:35:21.900]  So in cases like tax protester cases or other cases like that, you see some of this politically
[1:35:21.900 --> 1:35:26.660]  motivated justice where you see a different set of rules than you would see that are supposed
[1:35:26.660 --> 1:35:31.060]  to be applied and that are applied for everyone else, but here it was just high profile.
[1:35:31.060 --> 1:35:35.140]  I think what scares members of the institutional left is it's just so obvious.
[1:35:35.140 --> 1:35:39.060]  I mean, first they gag Roger Stone to prevent him from defending himself in the court of
[1:35:39.060 --> 1:35:45.020]  public opinion, then they have a secret jury selection process that keeps people from knowing
[1:35:45.020 --> 1:35:50.200]  who is being selected and whether the people being selected are biased and not impartial
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:53.820]  as they're supposed to be under the Sixth Amendment to US Constitution.
[1:35:53.820 --> 1:36:00.300]  And then they see the way in which the verdict currently and just complete convictions of
[1:36:00.300 --> 1:36:04.380]  everybody on everything in terms of Roger Stone and question whether that was really
[1:36:04.380 --> 1:36:08.540]  a thoughtful, thorough jury or a jury that had made up its mind before it even took the
[1:36:08.540 --> 1:36:10.980]  stand or took the jury participation.
[1:36:10.980 --> 1:36:14.740]  So it's that aggregate, even though there was testimony at the trial that appeared to
[1:36:14.740 --> 1:36:20.660]  exculpate Stone, and then after that, you see members of the media, including John McCain's
[1:36:20.660 --> 1:36:23.900]  daughter and others, celebrating this.
[1:36:23.900 --> 1:36:27.420]  Chank Ugar at Young Turks talking about 50-year prison sentences.
[1:36:27.420 --> 1:36:32.380]  So even people that say that they're worried about over-criminalization in the United States,
[1:36:32.380 --> 1:36:37.580]  people who worry about rapists and murderers getting prison sentences, suddenly are celebrating
[1:36:37.580 --> 1:36:41.900]  potential life sentences for people like Roger Stone based on whether or not he properly
[1:36:41.900 --> 1:36:47.140]  remembered something in a question in a politicized inquiry that had nothing to do with the substantive
[1:36:47.140 --> 1:36:48.860]  content of that inquiry.
[1:36:48.860 --> 1:36:53.900]  So it reveals the scope and scale to which a politicized trial takes place in the United
[1:36:53.900 --> 1:37:00.420]  States that sort of makes tomorrow out of what our criminal is supposed to be.
[1:37:00.420 --> 1:37:03.940]  So every aspect of it, the fact that it was tried in a venue that was known to have jurors
[1:37:03.940 --> 1:37:08.580]  hostile to Roger Stone and unlikely to be impartial, the way jury selection itself went, the gag
[1:37:08.580 --> 1:37:12.500]  order throughout the process, and then threats to members of the media, by other members
[1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:17.860]  of the media, by former Obama-era prosecutors, some of them high-ranking prosecutors, demanding
[1:37:17.860 --> 1:37:21.860]  criminal investigations and arrests of anyone who questioned it or challenged it.
[1:37:21.860 --> 1:37:26.180]  These are stasi-style tactics that even the stasi wouldn't publicly announce.
[1:37:26.180 --> 1:37:30.260]  Soviet-style trials that even the Soviet Union would be ashamed to have publicly displayed
[1:37:30.260 --> 1:37:31.340]  in this manner.
[1:37:31.340 --> 1:37:35.020]  And then when it's compounded by what happened in San Francisco, where someone forexposing
[1:37:35.020 --> 1:37:39.740]  the truth about Planned Parenthood-related organizations gets fined effectively close
[1:37:39.740 --> 1:37:44.420]  to a million dollars, where a judge apparently basically instructed the jury on questions
[1:37:44.420 --> 1:37:49.380]  that really should have been jury questions, reveals the scope and scale to which the politicized
[1:37:49.380 --> 1:37:54.820]  judiciary, the weaponized legal system, is being used to suppress conservatives, suppress
[1:37:54.820 --> 1:38:00.420]  conservative thought, and punish conservatives for merely being conservative in this country.
[1:38:00.420 --> 1:38:04.700]  And the disparity and duality of the two-tier justice system, where we've yet to see a
[1:38:04.700 --> 1:38:08.780]  criminal prosecution of any deep-state member involved in corruption, collusion, yet to
[1:38:08.780 --> 1:38:12.540]  see a prosecution of either Clapper or Brennan or these other people that have been caught
[1:38:12.540 --> 1:38:17.500]  lying to Congress repeatedly, yet to see a prosecution of anybody connected to the Clinton
[1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:22.100]  Foundation of New York, while the same prosecutor's office is harassing the president on his tax
[1:38:22.100 --> 1:38:25.060]  returns in ways that have no relationship.
[1:38:25.060 --> 1:38:28.420]  They believe they're safe because they know about all the crimes that other deep-state
[1:38:28.420 --> 1:38:33.300]  operatives have been involved in, and they think they're too corrupt to fail, too big
[1:38:33.300 --> 1:38:39.140]  to fail, and they've held the nation hostage for so long, they have to be indicted.
[1:38:39.140 --> 1:38:40.660]  They have to get in trouble.
[1:38:40.660 --> 1:38:45.260]  I mean, there's more than one way to skin a cat as well, and I think we are rapidly
[1:38:45.260 --> 1:38:46.460]  approaching those points.
[1:38:46.460 --> 1:38:51.180]  I'm not going to engage any violence, and I don't like elements that are pro-America
[1:38:51.180 --> 1:38:56.500]  in the deep state doing that, but that is historically, without letting them cause a
[1:38:56.500 --> 1:39:01.300]  huge uproar to the country or the stock market, at a certain point, these individuals would
[1:39:01.300 --> 1:39:06.980]  start having canoeing accidents or falling off their yacht, falling into the swimming
[1:39:06.980 --> 1:39:07.980]  pool in the backyard.
[1:39:07.980 --> 1:39:11.540]  I mean, they're the ones calling for the president's death, civil war, murder.
[1:39:11.540 --> 1:39:14.740]  They're the ones pushing everyone towards the collapse of civilization, and we just
[1:39:14.740 --> 1:39:19.820]  sit there while they punch us in the nose over and over again, paralyzed by the fact
[1:39:19.820 --> 1:39:22.020]  that we're America and we're not a banana republic.
[1:39:22.020 --> 1:39:26.460]  Well, they've taken us to the banana republic zone, and I think they're starting to get
[1:39:26.460 --> 1:39:30.700]  the pucker factor realizing that this is a game of chicken and we're not backing off,
[1:39:30.700 --> 1:39:34.780]  and they've really already discredited themselves, and that it's going to be very explosive.
[1:39:34.780 --> 1:39:36.140]  Thank you for joining us.
[1:39:36.140 --> 1:39:37.900]  Robert Barnes, talk to you again soon.
[1:39:37.900 --> 1:39:38.900]  God bless.
[1:39:38.900 --> 1:39:39.900]  Happy to be here.
[1:39:39.900 --> 1:39:40.900]  Thank you.
[1:39:40.900 --> 1:39:41.900]  I want to finish up.
[1:39:41.900 --> 1:39:44.780]  Now, I think Tyler Skype might have cut out.
[1:39:44.780 --> 1:39:48.900]  Tyler Nixon, Stone's personal lawyer, not a lawyer on this case, but he was there just
[1:39:48.900 --> 1:39:49.900]  in a few minutes.
[1:39:49.900 --> 1:39:56.580]  Tell us about the trial itself, any concerns you had, and then also where this is going
[1:39:56.580 --> 1:40:02.980]  to be, and when technically it's proper time for the president to pardon Stone.
[1:40:02.980 --> 1:40:07.100]  I mean, would that be right after the sentencing in February?
[1:40:07.100 --> 1:40:08.100]  Okay.
[1:40:08.100 --> 1:40:09.900]  I hope I can get more in a minute here.
[1:40:09.900 --> 1:40:14.380]  The time is now for the president to issue a pardon for Mr. Stone.
[1:40:14.380 --> 1:40:17.980]  He could have issued a pardon before this went down, there would have been no conviction.
[1:40:17.980 --> 1:40:21.580]  So he's sitting on his hands, and I'm really upset with the president, frankly, for letting
[1:40:21.580 --> 1:40:23.180]  this get as far as it's gotten.
[1:40:23.180 --> 1:40:28.580]  This is a kangaroo lynch mob show trial that went on in Washington, DC, and it's the most
[1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:32.860]  disgusting abuse of power I've seen in my entire legal career, and I was very intimate
[1:40:32.860 --> 1:40:33.860]  with the case.
[1:40:33.860 --> 1:40:38.420]  I wasn't on the team representing Mr. Stone, but let me tell you something, Roger, before
[1:40:38.420 --> 1:40:42.900]  we even got to the courthouse, they issued, or the government filed, and was granted,
[1:40:42.900 --> 1:40:47.300]  of course, motions in lemonade, which eliminate the ability to introduce evidence.
[1:40:47.300 --> 1:40:51.860]  And some of that evidence, two of the key points where we could not discuss in any way
[1:40:51.860 --> 1:40:57.660]  whatsoever, Russian collusion or anything to do with the investigation of the so-called
[1:40:57.660 --> 1:41:01.500]  Russian, the Russian collusion hoax, we could not even bring up evidence as to how that
[1:41:01.500 --> 1:41:05.860]  was fake and false and hoax, that was totally excluded and worse.
[1:41:05.860 --> 1:41:11.340]  They excluded us from even discussing in any way whatsoever, bringing up in evidence any
[1:41:11.340 --> 1:41:15.780]  government corruption or anything that went on in the investigation itself, meaning if
[1:41:15.780 --> 1:41:21.820]  we discovered bias such as Jeannie Rhee, the lead investigator that led to this, who was
[1:41:21.820 --> 1:41:27.100]  the Clinton Foundation attorney, all the political implications involved with those people, the
[1:41:27.100 --> 1:41:28.100]  total one-sidedness.
[1:41:28.100 --> 1:41:35.260]  Now you have Andrew Weissman, this criminal, as far as I'm concerned, just attorney who's
[1:41:35.260 --> 1:41:40.260]  been working in the Department of Justice as some sort of stalking hitman behind the
[1:41:40.260 --> 1:41:41.260]  scenes.
[1:41:41.260 --> 1:41:44.540]  And there's now an MSNBC legal analyst, boy, that didn't take long.
[1:41:44.540 --> 1:41:50.820]  Literally the day Roger Stone, it gets convicted in a DC jury, a DC court, excuse me, by DC
[1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:57.140]  jury with a 94% Democratic or non-Republican registration, let's just say.
[1:41:57.140 --> 1:42:01.340]  And we could not introduce evidence of any of this type of stuff, it was excluded at
[1:42:01.340 --> 1:42:02.340]  the outset.
[1:42:02.340 --> 1:42:06.780]  And I just find that totally outrageous, why would they have a problem with any airing
[1:42:06.780 --> 1:42:11.100]  of any type of issues of corruption or bias?
[1:42:11.100 --> 1:42:15.460]  And then we saw the judge go on to do that with the jury, she was just accepting jurors
[1:42:15.460 --> 1:42:20.780]  who said, no, I'm with, I worked for, I was Obama's, but we know what went on.
[1:42:20.780 --> 1:42:26.300]  But basically this is just this Weissman guy, he was on there bashing Republicans, literally
[1:42:26.300 --> 1:42:33.300]  giving strategy on how they should have, how they basically messed up by not saying certain
[1:42:33.300 --> 1:42:37.020]  things that would protect them from the Democrats' phony assaults.
[1:42:37.020 --> 1:42:40.900]  And this guy is now an MSNBC legal analyst, he was just on the Mueller team.
[1:42:40.900 --> 1:42:42.900]  I mean, talk about like just, they don't even care about it.
[1:42:42.900 --> 1:42:44.940]  Tyler Nixon, you're absolutely right.
[1:42:44.940 --> 1:42:46.500]  Thank you at Tyler Nixon on Twitter.
[1:42:46.500 --> 1:42:51.020]  God bless you, we'll come back with the really big news on the other side about the nature
[1:42:51.020 --> 1:42:59.100]  of the control grid and how to stop it on this live Sunday edition, stay with us.
[1:42:59.100 --> 1:43:03.620]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most of
[1:43:03.620 --> 1:43:08.260]  those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[1:43:08.260 --> 1:43:10.220]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[1:43:10.220 --> 1:43:14.980]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[1:43:14.980 --> 1:43:19.660]  And I knew that when they were setting a sub-PD platform, that they were really setting the
[1:43:19.660 --> 1:43:28.060]  precedent to take everybody off air, to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information
[1:43:28.060 --> 1:43:32.660]  on fake whistleblowers, so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[1:43:32.660 --> 1:43:38.900]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[1:43:38.900 --> 1:43:44.540]  It was the model of Info Wars as much as the information that had to be silenced.
[1:43:44.540 --> 1:43:49.100]  Because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're
[1:43:49.100 --> 1:43:54.020]  pushing to succeed and that's why keeping Info Wars on the air is now more imperative
[1:43:54.020 --> 1:43:58.060]  and more vital than ever.
[1:43:58.060 --> 1:44:01.900]  Info Wars presents the Alex Jones Show.
[1:44:01.900 --> 1:44:05.540]  You supporting the broadcast over the years is why we're still here, so that's why you
[1:44:05.540 --> 1:44:08.660]  spreading the word is so critical and that's why buying the products is critical.
[1:44:08.660 --> 1:44:12.140]  Because these are great products you already want and need and then you literally couldn't
[1:44:12.140 --> 1:44:15.620]  stop them, some of your know the globalists more by holding us up against their onslaught.
[1:44:15.620 --> 1:44:16.620]  It's amazing.
[1:44:16.620 --> 1:44:19.580]  InfoWarsTour.com, we've never gone a week and a half over with a sale, usually two, three
[1:44:19.580 --> 1:44:22.740]  days, I'm always busy, but this time I just haven't done it because we're selling out
[1:44:22.740 --> 1:44:23.740]  a lot of stuff.

[1:44:35.060 --> 1:44:36.060]  about to sell out.
[1:44:36.060 --> 1:44:38.820]  We've got a lot of great water filtration, air filtration, there's just so much great

[1:44:50.220 --> 1:44:54.500]  They're also the ones that call in, they're the 1%ers, so we salute you and thank you.
[1:44:54.500 --> 1:45:00.460]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:05.180]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from
[1:45:05.180 --> 1:45:10.420]  New York City to Florida where he's always said he planned to retire to and the left
[1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:12.940]  got so excited.
[1:45:12.940 --> 1:45:19.620]  They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running
[1:45:19.620 --> 1:45:20.620]  to Florida.
[1:45:20.620 --> 1:45:23.220]  Well, now we know why the president did that.
[1:45:23.220 --> 1:45:25.980]  He knew the left is controlled appeals courts.
[1:45:25.980 --> 1:45:29.900]  We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them
[1:45:29.900 --> 1:45:33.300]  and harass every business partner he's got.
[1:45:33.300 --> 1:45:39.260]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with and by moving his domicile from New York
[1:45:39.260 --> 1:45:44.980]  to Florida, that gets around the New York law they've passed to get his tax returns
[1:45:44.980 --> 1:45:46.980]  that are supposed to be private.
[1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:52.420]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign, in his
[1:45:52.420 --> 1:45:59.180]  words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[1:45:59.180 --> 1:46:06.580]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers that without
[1:46:06.580 --> 1:46:10.100]  you we won't be on the air and I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:46:10.100 --> 1:46:14.260]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing
[1:46:14.260 --> 1:46:17.380]  the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[1:46:17.380 --> 1:46:23.300]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are
[1:46:23.300 --> 1:46:24.300]  really amazing.
[1:46:24.300 --> 1:46:28.180]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air
[1:46:28.180 --> 1:46:32.940]  filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find
[1:46:32.940 --> 1:46:33.940]  out there.
[1:46:33.940 --> 1:46:39.740]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[1:46:39.740 --> 1:46:43.620]  So it's not a burden to support Info Wars.
[1:46:43.620 --> 1:46:50.700]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes
[1:46:50.700 --> 1:46:54.260]  your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[1:46:54.260 --> 1:47:01.420]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[1:47:01.420 --> 1:47:15.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:15.180 --> 1:47:16.180]  Welcome my friends.
[1:47:16.180 --> 1:47:17.180]  This is the last segment of the broadcast.
[1:47:17.180 --> 1:47:22.860]  I want to thank you all for tuning in on this Sunday's show and for being active participants
[1:47:22.860 --> 1:47:30.020]  in really trying to stop the globalist transhumanist post-human project.
[1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:36.540]  And we spent a lot of time looking at the battles that go on and the political fights.
[1:47:36.540 --> 1:47:41.780]  But really it comes down to are you for a pro-human future or an anti-human future?
[1:47:41.780 --> 1:47:46.540]  Now here's what's frustrating about all this.
[1:47:46.540 --> 1:47:55.300]  The internet and what it was set up to do has been public really since it was set up.
[1:47:55.300 --> 1:48:07.180]  And it was a Manhattan project style program that conservatively has had, I'd have to say
[1:48:07.180 --> 1:48:10.540]  a thousand times is a conservative number.
[1:48:10.540 --> 1:48:15.180]  The amount of money and human energy has been put into.
[1:48:15.180 --> 1:48:23.060]  Because it very intelligently built along the telegraph and electricity model got people
[1:48:23.060 --> 1:48:33.020]  to buy into it and pay money to it as a utility to build the structure.
[1:48:33.020 --> 1:48:38.060]  But it's a utility that tracks and watches and controls everything you do and that can
[1:48:38.060 --> 1:48:46.700]  then also cut you off or rip you off by knowing who you are and where you're going and what
[1:48:46.700 --> 1:48:51.540]  you're doing in a really a billion different ways is a conservative number.
[1:48:51.540 --> 1:48:53.540]  It's really limitless.
[1:48:53.540 --> 1:48:56.780]  One example is I remember we learned about this 15 years ago and nobody believed us for
[1:48:56.780 --> 1:49:04.220]  about five years that major travel sites would have cookies and would know that you had money
[1:49:04.220 --> 1:49:07.220]  or didn't have money and would change prices accordingly.
[1:49:07.220 --> 1:49:11.580]  And maybe they know you're wealthy but a spend thrift they'll give you low prices if they
[1:49:11.580 --> 1:49:14.820]  know you're going to go somewhere else and then they'll share that data with companies
[1:49:14.820 --> 1:49:19.740]  or if they know you're wealthy and will spend a lot they'll gouge you.
[1:49:19.740 --> 1:49:23.780]  Or let's say you're poor but it'll still spend a lot of vice versa.
[1:49:23.780 --> 1:49:27.580]  So I could talk for a million years about this but more and more I'm going to cover
[1:49:27.580 --> 1:49:32.460]  all of this in greater detail.
[1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:40.140]  Because opposing the globalist infrastructure and realizing the larger plan is key now look
[1:49:40.140 --> 1:49:43.460]  I'm not some hypocrite up here and I'm not going to say that we don't have Google Analytics
[1:49:43.460 --> 1:49:45.540]  hooked up and cookies and all that kind of stuff.
[1:49:45.540 --> 1:49:52.060]  I'm talking about the master plan of what it was set up to do and the directive and
[1:49:52.060 --> 1:49:54.740]  then what the internet is evolving into.
[1:49:54.740 --> 1:50:02.180]  It was designed to evolve into that and there's a direction there's a trajectory of this.
[1:50:02.180 --> 1:50:13.220]  So here's the Internet Hall of Fame CJR Lick Letter who created it and he wanted basically
[1:50:13.220 --> 1:50:17.180]  for psychiatrists to be able to track everything you do in live time to be able to put out
[1:50:17.180 --> 1:50:23.580]  propaganda and then see how the propaganda manipulated you so they could change the propaganda
[1:50:23.580 --> 1:50:27.420]  in live time and track and trace and surveil you and they wanted a network of computers
[1:50:27.420 --> 1:50:33.980]  down to handheld computers that would interface with the computers and then they would basically
[1:50:33.980 --> 1:50:40.220]  control all of society as a neural network interfacing with humans.
[1:50:40.220 --> 1:50:45.980]  So this is a human machine interface that is already created an artificially intelligent
[1:50:45.980 --> 1:50:51.140]  system because it's got billions of nodes plugged into human brains.
[1:50:51.140 --> 1:50:59.660]  You understand it is a supercomputer but it's biological, hooked into silicon.
[1:50:59.660 --> 1:51:02.500]  Let's continue.
[1:51:02.500 --> 1:51:09.620]  Untold history of AI the DARPA dreamer who aimed for cyborg intelligence, JCR Lick Letter
[1:51:09.620 --> 1:51:16.580]  and he obviously a pretty smart fella and it's all been done called the Intergalactic Computer
[1:51:16.580 --> 1:51:19.580]  Network.
[1:51:19.580 --> 1:51:21.580]  Now what is Facebook?
[1:51:21.580 --> 1:51:26.020]  How do they get everybody to opt in to Google and Facebook all created by the NSA and DARPA
[1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:27.020]  and Incutel?
[1:51:27.020 --> 1:51:28.180]  This is not my opinion.
[1:51:28.180 --> 1:51:35.580]  It's like saying Ford was started by Henry Ford or Edison was started by Edison and
[1:51:35.580 --> 1:51:40.780]  you know Graham Bell by Alexander Graham Bell I mean or Marconi discovered radio frequency
[1:51:40.780 --> 1:51:41.780]  and all that.
[1:51:41.780 --> 1:51:52.020]  It's a fact, Tesla, you know, wireless is Facebook using your phone's camera and microphone
[1:51:52.020 --> 1:51:55.540]  to spy on you, infowars.com 2017.
[1:51:55.540 --> 1:52:00.820]  Now really we went back further than that but they talked to us like we're children.
[1:52:00.820 --> 1:52:09.060]  They talked to us like we're children but they needed to get you to opt into a system
[1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:12.580]  that wasn't just the NSA they needed to be private so they could say oh well you opted
[1:52:12.580 --> 1:52:16.980]  into it because you get mad if the NSA was doing that.
[1:52:16.980 --> 1:52:23.460]  But then Facebook is the node is the clearing house set up by the CIA and DARPA so that
[1:52:23.460 --> 1:52:27.620]  you put all your info on it so that everybody else shares it so it hooks into all the other
[1:52:27.620 --> 1:52:34.140]  wireless devices and systems from your smart TV to Netflix to your toaster to your smart
[1:52:34.140 --> 1:52:40.140]  refrigerator to your smart meter.
[1:52:40.140 --> 1:52:45.540]  All of this is for total control and so then we tell you this is happening before they
[1:52:45.540 --> 1:52:50.180]  ever even launched Facebook and you'll oh you're a conspiracy theorist just because
[1:52:50.180 --> 1:52:55.460]  we're reading what the engineers said they were setting up 60 plus years ago we're just
[1:52:55.460 --> 1:52:59.420]  guilty of being informed.
[1:52:59.420 --> 1:53:03.700]  Now here they are years later Facebook lets tons of companies get info about you including
[1:53:03.700 --> 1:53:12.220]  Amazon Netflix and Microsoft and if you have their apps Facebook is getting in control
[1:53:12.220 --> 1:53:15.260]  and if you have that app but not their apps it's all the same thing it's all the same
[1:53:15.260 --> 1:53:16.260]  people at the end of the day.
[1:53:16.260 --> 1:53:21.300]  It's what all the architecture is merging together Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple
[1:53:21.300 --> 1:53:25.500]  they're all building quote smart cities that totally control you and they're going to be
[1:53:25.500 --> 1:53:28.260]  tax exempt and have their own governance as soon.
[1:53:28.260 --> 1:53:33.260]  Facebook gave Spotify, Netflix access to users, private messages to all these articles.
[1:53:33.260 --> 1:53:37.500]  Facebook apps secretly assessing iPhone users' cameras this came out Friday and they go
[1:53:37.500 --> 1:53:47.700]  oh it's okay it's just a bug it's all accidental that we're videotaping you yeah right Facebook
[1:53:47.700 --> 1:53:54.420]  apps secretly accesses people's cameras as they read newsfeed independent reporting.
[1:53:54.420 --> 1:53:59.540]  The smart ecosystem people found out about the secret Google's takeover plan in Toronto
[1:53:59.540 --> 1:54:02.620]  so now they call it environmental so no one's allowed to say it's bad even though it's a
[1:54:02.620 --> 1:54:04.340]  total control grant nothing to do with the environment.
[1:54:04.340 --> 1:54:08.380]  Now don't worry we'll surveil you and make sure your carbon footprint goes down oh surveil
[1:54:08.380 --> 1:54:13.980]  me oh thank you and they're finding all this 5G hidden in everything we first reported
[1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:19.980]  on 5G in 2001 and that's what they put in the lamppost all over the US all over the
[1:54:19.980 --> 1:54:26.900]  world they've got DARPA funded separate cell towers to grab all your data and again we
[1:54:26.900 --> 1:54:34.860]  told you all this first the smart city ecosystem framework fears 5G weapons system on UK streets
[1:54:34.860 --> 1:54:41.140]  after conspiracy theorist takes apart okay so the police officer that's upset gives him
[1:54:41.140 --> 1:54:46.380]  the light they break it open it's got 5G it's got cameras it's got surveillance but this
[1:54:46.380 --> 1:54:51.060]  is in the Daily Star but the individual that did this we're going to get on the show he's
[1:54:51.060 --> 1:54:56.500]  the bad guy for doing it even though they admit it's all real and they're doing it and stealing
[1:54:56.500 --> 1:54:57.940]  all your data.
[1:54:57.940 --> 1:55:04.020]  New street lights to have homeland security applications Paul Joseph Watson 2011 and we
[1:55:04.020 --> 1:55:08.780]  specifically expose all of it and how it's got 5G and how it steals all your data and
[1:55:08.780 --> 1:55:12.860]  how it has hidden cameras and everything else.
[1:55:12.860 --> 1:55:16.140]  Smart street lights attract everything we do all the time that's info wars a few years
[1:55:16.140 --> 1:55:22.340]  later 2014 the future of sci-fi lamppost a few years later they tell you about it one
[1:55:22.340 --> 1:55:28.900]  in guardian Chicago seeking smart city tech solutions and it goes through it then they
[1:55:28.900 --> 1:55:33.140]  admit there's a major studies here that it's giving you cancer and that 5G kills you even
[1:55:33.140 --> 1:55:37.980]  faster they just call it conspiracy theory so it's okay now they announce forget 5G they're
[1:55:37.980 --> 1:55:44.900]  now rolling out 6G that's 7G 8G 9G 10G gives you brain cancer kills plants that are around
[1:55:44.900 --> 1:55:49.340]  it they don't care it's all just out in the open so what am I getting at here this is
[1:55:49.340 --> 1:55:56.260]  a plan computer machine interface takeover that kills biological life as it unfolds they
[1:55:56.260 --> 1:56:02.100]  have wired internet that's a thousand times faster than 5G they don't care because fiber
[1:56:02.100 --> 1:56:08.620]  optic doesn't hurt anybody and can't give you cancer this is all done so you can escape
[1:56:08.620 --> 1:56:13.820]  it so that they can energize all the devices and track and control you and like Promethean
[1:56:13.820 --> 1:56:17.620]  fire they just give us this stuff and think we can't help but run home and use it and
[1:56:17.620 --> 1:56:23.540]  kill ourselves kill our children we'll always surveil ourselves and pay the device companies
[1:56:23.540 --> 1:56:28.540]  and the wireless companies for the pleasure of them slowly killing us we pay for our own
[1:56:28.540 --> 1:56:35.140]  destruction so they get us to opt into it and then biological life will become impossible
[1:56:35.140 --> 1:56:40.180]  by the time it hits about 10G the studies say I mean you'll talk about half the people
[1:56:40.180 --> 1:56:46.660]  you know will be dying of cancer at that point miscarriages total death but that's okay because
[1:56:46.660 --> 1:56:49.820]  they're going to have uploads into the machine interface they're going to tell you and that
[1:56:49.820 --> 1:56:54.340]  is the admitted plan by the way to make biological life impossible there'll be a new form of
[1:56:54.340 --> 1:56:59.260]  life they say of course none of this is going to happen they the last level of the con is
[1:56:59.260 --> 1:57:05.260]  it's a satanic exterminist post human science we call it alien program to transmission sent
[1:57:05.260 --> 1:57:09.660]  to tell us how to kill ourselves and the establishment wants the alien technology to be able to live
[1:57:09.660 --> 1:57:14.060]  forever they believe so they're buying into the plan believing that the aliens are actually
[1:57:14.060 --> 1:57:17.100]  going to let them upload the machines and live forever they have themselves been totally
[1:57:17.100 --> 1:57:20.660]  con because they're so enamored with the inter dimensionals that they're in contact with we
[1:57:20.660 --> 1:57:26.340]  call demons they call aliens so that's that's the big secret and I told you all this year
[1:57:26.340 --> 1:57:30.180]  before it came out and now I'm telling you that this is how the alien set us and it's
[1:57:30.180 --> 1:57:34.260]  how they're doing it they're putting up systems that will kill all biological life on earth
[1:57:34.260 --> 1:57:37.900]  while they're spraying us with all the chemicals that are killing everybody else as well and
[1:57:37.900 --> 1:57:41.980]  this is it I want to say great job the crew hopefully I'll be back tomorrow live 11am
[1:57:41.980 --> 1:57:49.260]  central david night is at 8am and more shows at fan dot video thank you there's a famous
[1:57:49.260 --> 1:57:55.660]  quote by a marine corps general in the korean war when 3 million chai comms had flooded
[1:57:55.660 --> 1:58:03.020]  across the border and surrounded the marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it but
[1:58:03.020 --> 1:58:08.060]  the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told general were completely surrounded
[1:58:08.060 --> 1:58:16.460]  they said good we can attack in all directions well that's the point that info wars has reached
[1:58:16.460 --> 1:58:20.700]  and it really is epic it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without
[1:58:20.700 --> 1:58:27.460]  all your support but it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship
[1:58:27.460 --> 1:58:31.860]  becomes complete and it's not just americans but folks all over the world are completely
[1:58:31.860 --> 1:58:38.300]  silenced when it comes to speaking the name of a cia fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile
[1:58:38.300 --> 1:58:44.180]  or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars having its own platform
[1:58:44.180 --> 1:58:54.260]  that check makes the globalist a question was once posed to thomas deverson what is
[1:58:54.260 --> 1:59:02.740]  the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to how far will they go what's their
[1:59:02.740 --> 1:59:10.660]  limit and he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit the answer
[1:59:10.660 --> 1:59:18.460]  is there is no limit to evil it is a bottomless pit we've been taught in modern culture and
[1:59:18.460 --> 1:59:25.340]  society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will there's no devil or the god but
[1:59:25.340 --> 1:59:32.300]  those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and
[1:59:32.300 --> 1:59:37.740]  where we can live and what our houses can be like they just don't want us to have any values
[1:59:37.740 --> 1:59:43.780]  so they can run over us oxford's band clapping universities the u.s. of band 21 gun salutes
[1:59:43.780 --> 1:59:51.420]  for veterans these people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them you're
[1:59:51.420 --> 2:00:17.620]  listening to the alex jones show you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
