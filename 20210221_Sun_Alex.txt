[00:00.000 --> 00:12.440]  The image of this airplane's engine burning in flight is quite the allegory for this very
[00:12.440 --> 00:16.160]  moment in time for the United States of America.
[00:16.160 --> 00:21.680]  After his first month as president, Joe Biden has canceled the Keystone Pipeline, terminating
[00:21.680 --> 00:25.240]  thousands of jobs and raising fuel prices.
[00:25.240 --> 00:31.400]  The protection of our bulk power grid, which has already been infiltrated by the CCP, nodded
[00:31.400 --> 00:37.180]  presidential support for the CCP's strong-arming of Hong Kong, Chinese death camps, and the
[00:37.180 --> 00:43.720]  Uyghur genocide, rejoined the Paris Climate Accord to further destroy U.S. industry while
[00:43.720 --> 00:50.760]  China's industry burns at full throttle, and rejoined the CCP-run World Health Organization,
[00:50.760 --> 00:53.200]  pushing the COVID-19 hoax.
[00:53.200 --> 00:56.920]  The federal government has completely fallen to the CCP.
[00:56.920 --> 00:59.680]  America has lost one of its engines.
[00:59.680 --> 01:04.680]  It is now up to our one remaining engine, the states, to pull us up before we crash,
[01:04.680 --> 01:07.760]  or at the very least, give us a good landing.
[01:07.760 --> 01:22.560]  Section 4 of the 25th Amendment empowers the vice-president and a majority of the president's cabinet to determine
[01:22.560 --> 01:26.760]  that the president is no longer fit to serve as president.
[01:26.760 --> 01:30.920]  It was attempted on President Trump in 2017.
[01:30.920 --> 01:35.920]  Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply, Rod raised the issue and discussed it with
[01:35.920 --> 01:44.120]  me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such
[01:44.120 --> 01:45.120]  an effort.
[01:45.120 --> 01:51.680]  Well, I've been speaking out about the invocation of the 25th Amendment since early this year,
[01:51.680 --> 01:56.360]  because I do think the president is not equipped to do the job.
[01:56.360 --> 01:58.680]  And recently, after the Capitol riot.
[01:58.680 --> 02:03.320]  And I don't know where his cabinet has been all of this time, but it's long overdue for
[02:03.320 --> 02:08.120]  the 25th Amendment because this man is no longer capable of serving the United States
[02:08.120 --> 02:09.120]  of America.
[02:09.120 --> 02:12.600]  Of course, Trump's mental fitness wasn't the real issue.
[02:12.600 --> 02:18.400]  It was his pro-America rhetoric that drove the Democrats to abuse Section 4 of the 25th
[02:18.400 --> 02:19.400]  Amendment.
[02:19.400 --> 02:24.520]  President Donald Trump, who tweeted, quote, crazy Nancy is the one who should be under
[02:24.520 --> 02:25.680]  observation.
[02:25.680 --> 02:27.720]  They don't call her crazy for nothing.
[02:27.720 --> 02:32.440]  But when it comes to mental fitness, Biden has just one month proven.
[02:32.440 --> 02:35.760]  He is out to lunch and a prime candidate.
[02:35.760 --> 02:40.880]  We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer.
[02:40.880 --> 02:47.160]  And some of it will come as early, begin to come in early summer, but by the mid-summer
[02:47.160 --> 02:50.080]  that this vaccine will be there.
[02:50.080 --> 02:57.440]  And the order, and that increases the total vaccine order in the United States by 50 percent
[02:57.440 --> 03:02.000]  from 400 million order to 600 million.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  Just enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 Americans by end of the summer, the beginning
[03:09.000 --> 03:10.000]  of the fall.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.160]  It's clear, to me at least, that U.S. President Joe Biden is struggling with dementia and
[03:15.160 --> 03:18.720]  is clearly not up to the task he's been sworn in to do.
[03:18.720 --> 03:23.440]  It was quite telling that while President Biden was playing Mario Kart and napping all
[03:23.440 --> 03:30.080]  of last weekend, apparently he had no official duties, his ambitious deputy Kamala Harris
[03:30.080 --> 03:32.680]  was telephoning foreign leaders.
[03:32.680 --> 03:37.680]  Biden started off by excusing the genocide against the Uyghur people by the Chinese Communist
[03:37.680 --> 03:38.680]  Party.
[03:38.680 --> 03:42.160]  He dismissed it as just Chinese cultural norms.
[03:42.160 --> 03:48.400]  The central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled
[03:48.400 --> 03:49.720]  China.
[03:49.720 --> 03:53.560]  And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.
[03:53.560 --> 03:58.240]  I point out to him, no American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn't
[03:58.240 --> 04:00.760]  reflect the values of the United States.
[04:00.760 --> 04:06.320]  And so the idea, I'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what
[04:06.320 --> 04:13.720]  he's doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the one
[04:13.720 --> 04:16.640]  China policy by making it forceful.
[04:16.640 --> 04:21.240]  I said, and Biden, he said, he gets it.
[04:21.240 --> 04:26.200]  Culturally there are different norms in each country and their leaders are expected to
[04:26.200 --> 04:27.200]  follow.
[04:27.200 --> 04:32.640]  And then he went on to suggest that blacks, Hispanics, and people who live in the country
[04:32.640 --> 04:36.400]  aren't really smart enough to get online.
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.960]  A lot of people don't know how to register, not everybody in the community, in the Hispanic
[04:40.960 --> 04:48.080]  and the African American community, particularly in rural areas that are distant and or inner
[04:48.080 --> 04:49.080]  city.
[04:49.080 --> 04:54.680]  That's just part of the report, see the same entire report at band.video and share it.
[04:54.680 --> 05:02.320]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[05:02.320 --> 05:07.680]  Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[05:07.680 --> 05:10.320]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[05:10.320 --> 05:11.320]  Because it works.
[05:11.320 --> 05:13.760]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[05:13.760 --> 05:22.000]  So whether it's sawpong meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostaguard,
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.320]  or whether it is the super high grade organic vitamin B12 and ultra 12, or whether it's
[05:27.320 --> 05:34.320]  the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force, or the pure deep breath crystal iodine X2, these
[05:34.320 --> 05:40.680]  are all the very best supplements you're going to find in an already great market of
[05:40.680 --> 05:42.480]  high quality products out there.
[05:42.480 --> 05:44.080]  And it funds the M4WAR.
[05:44.080 --> 05:47.520]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're fun of the M4WARs,
[05:47.520 --> 05:48.520]  you can't lose.
[05:48.520 --> 05:51.040]  M4WARs delivers in space.
[05:51.040 --> 05:53.760]  Visit infowarstore.com and get the products today.
[05:53.760 --> 06:20.160]  And again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at infowarstore.com.
[06:20.160 --> 06:26.920]  We are witnessing the scientific premeditated corporate global government directed dismantlement
[06:26.920 --> 06:32.280]  of the United States of America as we know it, because a private corporate tyranny is
[06:32.280 --> 06:33.680]  being set up.
[06:33.680 --> 06:37.880]  They don't want uppity Americans that have due process that have a right to self-defense,
[06:37.880 --> 06:39.960]  a right to private property, a right to travel.
[06:39.960 --> 06:43.000]  They don't like having a big middle class to deal with.
[06:43.000 --> 06:44.560]  They don't care what color you are.
[06:44.560 --> 06:47.800]  They want you poor and under their control.
[06:47.800 --> 06:52.000]  So I have really prepared a lot, always prepared for the broadcast, but I've really prepared
[06:52.000 --> 06:53.000]  a lot today.
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.200]  So let me do you my little best going over what we're going to be breaking down today.
[06:59.200 --> 07:05.080]  We have the new attorney general now confirmed, who swears to declare war on all Trump voters,
[07:05.080 --> 07:10.120]  all 80 million of them, and he has general ID array that carried out the gun confiscation
[07:10.120 --> 07:16.720]  in Katrina famously, saying that all Trump supporters are white supremacists and terrorists.
[07:16.720 --> 07:19.800]  These are people are just completely insane and out of control.
[07:19.800 --> 07:26.920]  We're going to be laying all of that out for you today, Sunday live, new attorney general
[07:26.920 --> 07:30.840]  pledges to persecute all populist Americans.
[07:30.840 --> 07:35.920]  One month of Biden and America is already collapsing.
[07:35.920 --> 07:40.320]  He carried out the gun confiscation in Katrina of people in their homes, high and dry, and
[07:40.320 --> 07:47.480]  he is prepared to move against the public now.
[07:47.480 --> 07:49.400]  So that is all coming up.
[07:49.400 --> 07:55.520]  Here is general ID array, and we'll also be getting to the new attorney general.
[07:55.520 --> 08:00.280]  Biden the Democrats still running scared after stealing election will never hold an open
[08:00.280 --> 08:01.760]  event with the American people.
[08:01.760 --> 08:05.400]  It is so incredibly obvious.
[08:05.400 --> 08:09.720]  Ignored by media dirtbag Joe Biden says US veterans and former police officers are feeling
[08:09.720 --> 08:13.640]  white supremacy in America, school children are being taught nationwide.
[08:13.640 --> 08:17.920]  We have PSAs that whiteness is evil that must be rejected and rebuked.
[08:17.920 --> 08:21.880]  I mean, this is just beyond KKK stuff on the left.
[08:21.880 --> 08:25.600]  Meanwhile, the Justice Department and FBI are investigating whether Roger Stone and
[08:25.600 --> 08:28.280]  Alex Jones play a role in the Capitol siege.
[08:28.280 --> 08:34.880]  That's the Washington Post, US investigating Alex Jones and Roger Stone, I mean leaving
[08:34.880 --> 08:39.920]  the Chai Comron FBI investigating Alex Jones and Roger Stone for links to Capitol writers.
[08:39.920 --> 08:41.760]  Oh my goodness.
[08:41.760 --> 08:47.360]  Once upon a presidency, populace to dissident, and that ties in to meet the new president
[08:47.360 --> 08:50.640]  of the United States, Barack Obama, now in his third term.
[08:50.640 --> 08:56.280]  That is the first stack that I'm going to cover in detail next segment.
[08:56.280 --> 08:59.800]  That's just one of the stacks.
[08:59.800 --> 09:02.800]  Let's look at the next stack I'm going to cover in the segment after that.
[09:02.800 --> 09:07.160]  Being gun, Joe Biden's Department of Energy blocked Texas from increasing power ahead
[09:07.160 --> 09:08.360]  of killer storm.
[09:08.360 --> 09:12.000]  We have the Department of Energy document, and of course we'll show how under Obama
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.320]  they shut down over 100 power plants, Trump had to turn them back on, but the owner said
[09:16.320 --> 09:19.800]  we don't trust the fact that you'll be still in office, they're going to remove you so
[09:19.800 --> 09:22.160]  they never reopen any of the coal power plants.
[09:22.160 --> 09:24.000]  Natural gas doesn't work in the cold.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.760]  We had natural gas generator because it's all you can basically buy these days.
[09:27.760 --> 09:30.040]  It failed here as well.
[09:30.040 --> 09:33.200]  So when Bill Gates goes, oh, it's natural gas that failed, yeah, because you took the
[09:33.200 --> 09:36.720]  coal power plants out.
[09:36.720 --> 09:43.480]  That is all coming up, and the 18,000% power increases for many people, folks with $500
[09:43.480 --> 09:45.480]  bills got $17,000 bills.
[09:45.480 --> 09:49.160]  Now remember I told you, once they're rolling back, blackouts begin, they'll always use
[09:49.160 --> 09:52.800]  cold weather or really hot weather as excuse.
[09:52.800 --> 09:56.480]  They'll then down their regular systems and then make you buy it from other grids that
[09:56.480 --> 10:00.240]  they own and control and make billions an hour sometimes.
[10:00.240 --> 10:01.240]  And that's what happened.
[10:01.240 --> 10:07.600]  The major fleecing of Texas, I will give you the complete breakdown of that, the huge special
[10:07.600 --> 10:14.320]  report on Friday with the exclusive document protested at the governor's mansion yesterday
[10:14.320 --> 10:19.600]  because he's got Joe Biden coming sometime next week to grandstand and give us our own
[10:19.600 --> 10:23.480]  tax money back and tell us how it's Texas' fault that the power went out.
[10:23.480 --> 10:28.520]  And it wasn't, and I've been warning, this was coming at nauseam.
[10:28.520 --> 10:34.680]  Then after we cover that incredibly important area, we have its madness, and I've actually
[10:34.680 --> 10:40.600]  read the new, or scanned over the new legislation, former Trump advisor Stephen Miller goes off.
[10:40.600 --> 10:45.400]  Democrats propose sending invites to criminal legal aliens, rapists, murderers, you name
[10:45.400 --> 10:47.720]  it, to come back and get citizenship.
[10:47.720 --> 10:53.040]  But outside of that, by she ought, they've already opened the borders up completely.
[10:53.040 --> 10:58.240]  It doesn't matter how unpopular it is because Joe Biden stole the election.
[10:58.240 --> 11:05.480]  That is all coming up, AT&T trying to merge the whole Huawei and the Communist Chinese.
[11:05.480 --> 11:09.360]  That's another incredibly important stack.
[11:09.360 --> 11:15.560]  Also all from LA to Baltimore, Maryland, from California to Maryland, all over the country,
[11:15.560 --> 11:18.520]  New York to Dallas, Texas is proposing it.
[11:18.520 --> 11:21.280]  They say pay criminals not to rob and kill.
[11:21.280 --> 11:26.480]  It's a new novel idea, pay people not to murder, Baltimore urges city, Baltimore activists
[11:26.480 --> 11:28.760]  to pay criminals not to murder.
[11:28.760 --> 11:32.640]  That's called paying a pirate, paying someone for a ransom.
[11:32.640 --> 11:33.640]  It's been done before.
[11:33.640 --> 11:37.920]  And as Rudger Kipling said, once you pay the pirate once, you'll pay him twice, you'll
[11:37.920 --> 11:42.640]  pay him three times, but he finally kidnaps you and sells you for a ransom as well.
[11:42.640 --> 11:44.320]  That's how third world countries collapse.
[11:44.320 --> 11:50.520]  And we're following an exact trail of collapse, and the country's being sucked dry while we
[11:50.520 --> 11:53.560]  all versus signaling wear our mask.
[11:53.560 --> 11:56.920]  And now they, Biden says it's permanent, never take them off, it doesn't matter if you take
[11:56.920 --> 11:58.840]  the vaccine, that doesn't protect you.
[11:58.840 --> 12:02.800]  Oh, there's herd immunity, suddenly the death toll is way down because the winter is going
[12:02.800 --> 12:05.880]  to end and there won't be people dying of flu and all the rest of it.
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.800]  It's a giant fraud, but we still comply so the tyranny gets worse.
[12:10.800 --> 12:12.800]  And then the big whopper.
[12:12.800 --> 12:16.240]  Now I'm going to cover this last segment of the first hour.
[12:16.240 --> 12:23.480]  When I read the headline, I thought, okay, I trust Christian and a hand at information
[12:23.480 --> 12:24.480]  liberation.
[12:24.480 --> 12:25.480]  That's a great job.
[12:25.480 --> 12:26.480]  And I said, let me go read the New York Times article.
[12:26.480 --> 12:29.680]  It was true within two paragraphs.
[12:29.680 --> 12:36.360]  It says critical thinking is the enemy and must be suspended in your mind directly called
[12:36.360 --> 12:41.760]  crime stop or double thing from night candy for and a guy that stalked me here in Austin
[12:41.760 --> 12:48.280]  for a long time, Charlie Wurzel, the weasel is in the article talking to professors about
[12:48.280 --> 12:54.120]  how we must only believe them and only follow them and disregard everything else and report
[12:54.120 --> 12:56.680]  anyone that doesn't agree with the New York Times.
[12:56.680 --> 13:01.280]  I mean, that's what cults do when they get wobbly is don't talk to your family, don't
[13:01.280 --> 13:05.240]  read anything else, don't have any friends, only the cult.
[13:05.240 --> 13:10.120]  New York Times critical thinking isn't helping in the fight against misinformation.
[13:10.120 --> 13:11.120]  No.
[13:11.120 --> 13:12.520]  No, no, no, no, no.
[13:12.520 --> 13:17.240]  It's like Snopes came out and Bill Gates came out last week and said, Alex Jones is a liar.
[13:17.240 --> 13:21.280]  They named me actually and said India did not ban the Pfizer shot.
[13:21.280 --> 13:22.840]  He's a liar.
[13:22.840 --> 13:27.560]  Anyone could type it, go to the Indian websites, all in English, a billion, 300 million people,
[13:27.560 --> 13:34.120]  super scientific in their science sectors and they banned it.
[13:34.120 --> 13:35.120]  They banned it.
[13:35.120 --> 13:37.280]  They said, no, you haven't done the studies.
[13:37.280 --> 13:45.080]  We got evidence, people being brain damaged and being paralyzed and then they had all these
[13:45.080 --> 13:49.880]  publications come out, Newsweek, you name it and say, I was a liar, that India approved
[13:49.880 --> 13:50.880]  the vaccine.
[13:50.880 --> 13:56.520]  Well, I'm going to show you, anybody could type in, India stops emergency approval of
[13:56.520 --> 13:57.520]  Pfizer mRNA vaccine.
[13:57.520 --> 13:58.520]  You'll get hundreds of articles.
[13:58.520 --> 13:59.520]  They don't care.
[13:59.520 --> 14:01.520]  They go, oh, don't believe them.
[14:01.520 --> 14:02.520]  No.
[14:02.520 --> 14:03.520]  And Hank Aaron.
[14:03.520 --> 14:04.520]  Remember Hank Aaron?
[14:04.520 --> 14:07.480]  The famous baseball player, probably the best ever.
[14:07.480 --> 14:14.120]  They said he died of the natural causes, not the second round of COVID and then they had
[14:14.120 --> 14:15.120]  an autopsy.
[14:15.120 --> 14:17.760]  Robert Kennedy Jr. went and talked to him.
[14:17.760 --> 14:20.360]  They gave him statements and said, we never saw his body.
[14:20.360 --> 14:23.000]  He died after the second shot.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.400]  They told us natural causes, so we bought it because of what we're told to do.
[14:26.400 --> 14:30.840]  Oh, and Pfizer withdraws application, put that back up, please.
[14:30.840 --> 14:37.000]  For the use of its COVID-19 vaccine, India CNBC, in fact, put that for me.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.560]  But I'm going to show you all these publications.
[14:41.560 --> 14:48.080]  I mean, it was in AP, it was in Reuters, it was in Newsweek, Jones made it up again.
[14:48.080 --> 14:49.080]  Wow.
[14:49.080 --> 14:55.520]  And imagine me and Charlie Warzell get 30 pieces of silver to sit there and lie to people
[14:55.520 --> 14:58.720]  and then write articles about, don't read anything with Newark Times.
[14:58.720 --> 15:02.160]  You'd think it's like satire, like this is a satire article, there's nothing satirical
[15:02.160 --> 15:03.160]  about it.
[15:03.160 --> 15:08.040]  These people are cult members and cult leaders and they think we're under their control.
[15:08.040 --> 15:09.040]  We're not.
[15:09.040 --> 15:12.320]  Meanwhile, they're about cults, Cartoon Network, PSA, we'll show you the video that's coming
[15:12.320 --> 15:13.320]  up.
[15:13.320 --> 15:18.920]  Tell children to see color to become anti-racist, that's a quote, preaches, color blindness
[15:18.920 --> 15:19.920]  is bad.
[15:19.920 --> 15:24.120]  So what Martin Luther King said, oh, don't choose a football player because he plays
[15:24.120 --> 15:27.320]  good, don't go to a restaurant because it tastes good, don't buy a suit because they
[15:27.320 --> 15:32.160]  do a good job, that's what I do, don't, no, no, no, it's the color of their skin.
[15:32.160 --> 15:34.720]  I mean, this is just evil, folks.
[15:34.720 --> 15:38.720]  But again, I was downtown protesting this weekend and I would say to the leftist and
[15:38.720 --> 15:44.920]  the leftist downtowner, I'd say, India band, Pfizer, watch out, Biden just endorsed death
[15:44.920 --> 15:45.920]  camps.
[15:45.920 --> 15:46.920]  There you go, good.
[15:46.920 --> 15:47.920]  I love death camps.
[15:47.920 --> 15:48.920]  Ask you.
[15:48.920 --> 15:50.920]  I mean, these people are fascist scum.
[15:50.920 --> 15:58.320]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[15:58.320 --> 16:04.040]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy,
[16:04.040 --> 16:06.160]  food, and medicine.
[16:06.160 --> 16:10.960]  And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal
[16:10.960 --> 16:17.480]  and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people lined up at the few grocery
[16:17.480 --> 16:22.400]  stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned away after hours
[16:22.400 --> 16:23.840]  of freezing in the cold.
[16:23.840 --> 16:27.840]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power
[16:27.840 --> 16:29.800]  in their house and they're running out of gas.
[16:29.800 --> 16:34.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water
[16:34.600 --> 16:35.600]  as well.
[16:35.600 --> 16:38.440]  They're both available, the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality

[17:50.160 --> 17:58.640]  of the new activated charcoal mouthwash right now at infowarstore.com.
[17:58.640 --> 18:02.120]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[18:02.120 --> 18:07.480]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought
[18:07.480 --> 18:09.160]  down to nothing.
[18:09.160 --> 18:14.440]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team, you're about
[18:14.440 --> 18:17.160]  to find out how pathetic you are.
[18:17.160 --> 18:24.360]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[18:24.360 --> 18:29.480]  The enemy is about to expose itself, the enemy can't help itself.
[18:29.480 --> 18:33.560]  The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy.
[18:33.560 --> 18:39.160]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it, we should but once
[18:39.160 --> 18:44.760]  it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking
[18:44.760 --> 18:49.040]  us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[18:49.040 --> 18:53.080]  So prepare yourselves America, you're going under judge but just like all the children
[18:53.080 --> 18:59.560]  that were aborted, this is the truth, this is the info war.
[18:59.560 --> 19:04.520]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[19:04.520 --> 19:09.240]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[19:09.240 --> 19:15.040]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[19:15.040 --> 19:21.120]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[19:21.120 --> 19:25.840]  an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're
[19:25.840 --> 19:30.360]  able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty
[19:30.360 --> 19:34.680]  of your wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[19:34.680 --> 19:35.680]  of music.
[19:35.680 --> 19:40.520]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[19:40.520 --> 19:43.320]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[19:43.320 --> 19:48.320]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the
[19:48.320 --> 19:53.840]  system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[19:53.840 --> 20:01.640]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[20:01.640 --> 20:09.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:09.760 --> 20:14.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:14.840 --> 20:16.960]  It's Sunday, February 21st.
[20:16.960 --> 20:20.200]  The year is 2021.
[20:20.200 --> 20:26.000]  The websites are infowars.com, newswars.com, it's band.video and the globalist hope around
[20:26.000 --> 20:33.320]  the clock that you don't research what they're really up to that you just sit there like
[20:33.320 --> 20:35.120]  a victim and take it.
[20:35.120 --> 20:39.440]  Next segment, I'm going to look at the power shutdowns in Texas and the smoking gun, I'm
[20:39.440 --> 20:43.520]  going to show you the Department of Energy document where the set of Texas four or five
[20:43.520 --> 20:48.760]  days before was begging them to let them turn up the power, but there's fines and criminal
[20:48.760 --> 20:53.200]  penalties if they do without authorization and they waited until it crashed on Valentine's
[20:53.200 --> 20:56.000]  Day to then let them do it.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.160]  Oh, let me wait until you're going under the freezing water, let me wait until you're
[20:59.160 --> 21:03.760]  dying to then give you a live fest so I can say in front of everybody that I've tried
[21:03.760 --> 21:04.760]  to help you.
[21:04.760 --> 21:05.760]  Very, very sick.
[21:05.760 --> 21:08.120]  We've got Joe Biden coming to town.
[21:08.120 --> 21:13.440]  In fact, here's Joe Biden babbling about how he's coming to Austin like Santa Claus
[21:13.440 --> 21:21.160]  to give us all this free money and to give us a hand here it is.
[21:21.160 --> 21:25.720]  And so we're going to sign that declaration once it's in front of me and God willing it
[21:25.720 --> 21:28.320]  will bring a lot of relief to a lot of Texans.
[21:28.320 --> 21:30.680]  He said he may visit Texas next week.
[21:30.680 --> 21:35.320]  If in fact it's concluded that I can do it without creating a burden for the folks on
[21:35.320 --> 21:40.280]  the ground while they're dealing with this crisis, I plan on going back in Texas.
[21:40.280 --> 21:41.760]  What a nice person.
[21:41.760 --> 21:46.320]  You know, I had an old Labrador Traveller to be about 14 and he's got that same look
[21:46.320 --> 21:52.000]  right before the dog died, like kind of scared and hesitant and trying to talk but can barely
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  do it.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.640]  I mean, his dementia is just accelerating so horribly and that's what they put him in
[21:56.640 --> 22:01.200]  there as a weak signal of the world to end the dollar, to move all our jobs to China
[22:01.200 --> 22:03.000]  and try to accelerate our collapse.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.000]  It's all on record.
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.360]  Council on Foreign Relations brags that Biden's a complete joke and it's the end of the country.
[22:09.360 --> 22:12.720]  And I was in downtown Austin trying to warn him this weekend with a bullhorn.
[22:12.720 --> 22:18.880]  I was down at the governor's mansion and about a 40% of people said, I want to kill you,
[22:18.880 --> 22:24.320]  another 20% kind of looked at me, but they were flipping me off and maybe 30% were listening
[22:24.320 --> 22:25.320]  and waving.
[22:25.320 --> 22:27.200]  But I mean, it's just sick.
[22:27.200 --> 22:32.000]  If I was in like a hard working area like Pittsburgh, everybody'd be saying, yeah, Alex,
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.560]  where I was in San Antonio, they'd be saying, yeah, Alex, but the liberal trendies are just
[22:37.560 --> 22:38.920]  absolutely out of their minds.
[22:38.920 --> 22:42.760]  There's no helping them, but they're going to find out real soon.
[22:42.760 --> 22:43.760]  So let's talk about this.
[22:43.760 --> 22:50.560]  Biden AG pick, Merrick Garland, vows to prosecute capital riders, zero hedge article.
[22:50.560 --> 22:55.040]  He said, I'm confirmed, I will supervise prosecution, the white supremacist of others
[22:55.040 --> 23:00.120]  who stormed the capital January 6th, a heinous attack that's thought to disrupt a cornerstone
[23:00.120 --> 23:01.280]  of our democracy.
[23:01.280 --> 23:05.000]  The people transfer a power to a newly elected government.
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  And that's the thing.
[23:06.000 --> 23:10.000]  When they protested them, they claimed to attack the capital and was like 200 out of
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.000]  a million.
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.040]  And then it turns out most of them are anti from other provocateurs and that's the big
[23:14.040 --> 23:15.680]  news I shouldn't be announcing.
[23:15.680 --> 23:18.600]  I've been up here basically all day working on this.
[23:18.600 --> 23:22.960]  And right now they're putting all the documents, all the videos, all the clips in at the bottom
[23:22.960 --> 23:28.680]  of the hour, next hour, I'm going to premiere a report will take two segments to play that
[23:28.680 --> 23:35.880]  is incredible and proves it has Democrats, anti from people that have been arrested.
[23:35.880 --> 23:42.320]  People caught working for CNN saying that they staged the capital attack and all the
[23:42.320 --> 23:46.120]  witnesses in the video, it's all come together, it's all come out in the last week.
[23:46.120 --> 23:47.120]  It's insane.
[23:47.120 --> 23:56.120]  And that's why they've got this horrible evil general who came out, General Idire, who ran
[23:56.120 --> 24:00.800]  the gun confiscation in Katrina.
[24:00.800 --> 24:03.960]  Remember how they went into the houses and went into high and dry areas and went into
[24:03.960 --> 24:08.920]  people all over the state and would come in and break into their safes and take their
[24:08.920 --> 24:09.920]  guns.
[24:09.920 --> 24:14.000]  Because General Idire said we're confiscating your guns and this has been used as a training
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.400]  drill across the country now for future gun confiscation.
[24:20.400 --> 24:25.480]  General Honor Ray, I'm not going off a teleprompter, General Honor Ray.
[24:25.480 --> 24:33.800]  So General Honor Ray who evacuated the Superdome 15 years ago talks about Katrina and he tells
[24:33.800 --> 24:36.040]  us what a big savior he is.
[24:36.040 --> 24:41.920]  But in reality, this is their giant power grab, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:41.920 --> 24:47.760]  And that takes us to this next article from MSN and whether it's the New York Times, the
[24:47.760 --> 24:51.040]  Washington Post, the LA Times, the Detroit Free Press, the Austin American States, the
[24:51.040 --> 24:54.720]  Houston Chronicle, every paper in the country ran this today.
[24:54.720 --> 24:58.720]  Feds probing Roger Stone, Alex Jones over roles in the capital.
[24:58.720 --> 25:05.600]  And the articles go on from there about how they want to arrest us, they want to get us.
[25:05.600 --> 25:10.360]  The Justice Department and FBI are investigating whether Roger Stone and Alex Jones played
[25:10.360 --> 25:13.560]  a role in the capital siege report sets.
[25:13.560 --> 25:15.360]  Oh my gosh.
[25:15.360 --> 25:18.680]  People call me, family calls, do they say are you concerned?
[25:18.680 --> 25:19.680]  No, I'm not concerned.
[25:19.680 --> 25:22.320]  I'm worried about the country.
[25:22.320 --> 25:24.200]  I know who did it.
[25:24.200 --> 25:26.880]  I know who ran the attack.
[25:26.880 --> 25:30.920]  I know the Democrat organizations who have the history of it and who we caught involved
[25:30.920 --> 25:35.800]  and who bragged and organized it, who ran the Q movement and who manipulated 200 people
[25:35.800 --> 25:39.040]  out of a million to do that and who ordered the police to stand out.
[25:39.040 --> 25:43.880]  Why do you think Lindsey Graham said the day they ended the witch hunt of Trump a week
[25:43.880 --> 25:44.880]  and a half ago?
[25:44.880 --> 25:51.800]  Why do you think Lindsey Graham said, what did Pelosi know and when did she know it?
[25:51.800 --> 25:54.840]  He knows she was briefed two weeks before, a week before or a day before, and she didn't
[25:54.840 --> 25:59.400]  tell even the Democrats, they knew the attack was coming and it turns out other Democrats
[25:59.400 --> 26:05.080]  bragged to Time Magazine that they knew and staged it and we have undercover recordings.
[26:05.080 --> 26:07.040]  It's all next hour.
[26:07.040 --> 26:11.520]  This is the most incredible information when it comes to exposing it, right as they try
[26:11.520 --> 26:14.400]  to saddle the American people with all of this.
[26:14.400 --> 26:19.200]  So I'm going to play for you when we come back.
[26:19.200 --> 26:24.040]  General IG Array, am I pronouncing that right this time?
[26:24.040 --> 26:26.040]  General Array, I know I'm being sarcastic.
[26:26.040 --> 26:33.600]  General Array, I'm going to play you General Array talking about confiscating your guns
[26:33.600 --> 26:39.000]  and taking your guns and saying no one will be alarmed, no one will be armed, or something
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.640]  Joe Biden suddenly can't talk.
[26:40.640 --> 26:43.240]  No one will be allowed to be armed.
[26:43.240 --> 26:45.120]  All the guns will be taken.
[26:45.120 --> 26:50.600]  You know, I'm not the oldest president in US history, I'm just 47 maybe, I'm getting
[26:50.600 --> 26:51.600]  seen now too.
[26:51.600 --> 26:56.760]  But that's the thing about being teleprompter free, sometimes your mind is completely sharp,
[26:56.760 --> 27:00.640]  doesn't like a needle going on the record, hit the exact spot, but when you come back,
[27:00.640 --> 27:05.520]  I'm going to lay all of that out for you and play the clips from back when Katrina took
[27:05.520 --> 27:10.960]  place of the incredible excuse to go into high and dry areas and take old ladies' guns,
[27:10.960 --> 27:17.000]  widows' guns, old men's guns, veterans' guns, and then a lot of the feds started just robbing
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.280]  with the local police, Walmart, and other stores.
[27:20.280 --> 27:22.040]  Remember all that?
[27:22.040 --> 27:25.720]  So if you want to see the criminality of who works for the government, you're going to
[27:25.720 --> 27:27.100]  see it coming up next segment.
[27:27.100 --> 27:30.800]  It's not everybody, but the government's so compartmentalized, good guys can't stop
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.320]  bad guys, so good guys work right next to giant compartments of bad guys.
[27:35.320 --> 27:38.960]  That's why it's so important, ladies and gentlemen, there are these incredibly dangerous times
[27:38.960 --> 27:42.840]  to keep info wars on the air.
[27:42.840 --> 27:45.960]  Without you, we're not going to be able to stay on air, without you, we're not going
[27:45.960 --> 27:49.960]  to be here, and I'm just going to keep going to the end no matter what happens.
[27:49.960 --> 27:53.520]  They want to get us, they want to put us in prison, they want to persecute us.
[27:53.520 --> 27:57.400]  That's okay, I expect to be attacked when I'm over the target.
[27:57.400 --> 28:00.600]  When you're over the target, all the guns are aimed at you.
[28:00.600 --> 28:02.520]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[28:02.520 --> 28:06.680]  I want to let you know that the high-quality, horrible food we have is ready to be shipped
[28:06.680 --> 28:08.880]  to you within a day of your order.
[28:08.880 --> 28:12.360]  It's shipped out from four locations across the United States.
[28:12.360 --> 28:16.680]  It's 10% off, it's high-quality, horrible food, the highest quality you're going to find
[28:16.680 --> 28:17.680]  for the price.
[28:17.680 --> 28:23.000]  We could pay three, four, five times and find some that taste a little bit better, but it
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.400]  is not inexpensive and high-quality like this.
[28:25.400 --> 28:28.560]  This is the best food for the price you're going to find.
[28:28.560 --> 28:34.800]  Prepare with Alex.com, it takes you right to the sub-page of infowarstore.com.
[28:34.800 --> 28:39.800]  That's infowarstore.com or prodeox.com for a limited time, a big discount because of
[28:39.800 --> 28:44.880]  the emergency, all the craziness, an additional 10% off, ready to ship out to you in waterproof
[28:44.880 --> 28:48.160]  packaging and so much more anywhere in the world, really.
[28:48.160 --> 28:52.960]  So infowarstore.com or prodeox.com, there's much other big specials as well on the site.
[28:52.960 --> 28:58.440]  Take advantage of those in the red vector.
[28:58.440 --> 29:05.400]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[29:05.400 --> 29:06.760]  that this is all a test.
[29:06.760 --> 29:12.720]  This experience, this mindfulness planet is a reckoning.
[29:12.720 --> 29:17.960]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide
[29:17.960 --> 29:22.280]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[29:22.280 --> 29:23.280]  down to that.
[29:23.280 --> 29:27.320]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[29:27.320 --> 29:31.600]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[29:31.600 --> 29:35.200]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[29:35.200 --> 29:40.880]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[29:40.880 --> 29:45.080]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington,
[29:45.080 --> 29:50.320]  D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[29:50.320 --> 29:54.320]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates
[29:54.320 --> 29:57.840]  you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[29:57.840 --> 30:02.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the Infowars War Room and I have
[30:02.080 --> 30:09.200]  had a major wake up call living in Texas this last week about how important storable food
[30:09.200 --> 30:10.200]  is.
[30:10.200 --> 30:15.000]  I have plenty of storable food in my house, but my notion has always been this is last
[30:15.000 --> 30:20.680]  case scenario, worst case scenario, like end of America, apocalyptic type of scenario,
[30:20.680 --> 30:22.760]  but I'm realizing now that's not the case.
[30:22.760 --> 30:27.000]  Folks, they can shut off the power, they can shut off the water at any given moment.
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.120]  Now I was lucky I had plenty of food in my fridge and in my pantry that I didn't have
[30:31.120 --> 30:35.320]  to dig into my storable food, but many people in Texas didn't.
[30:35.320 --> 30:39.360]  Don't be in that situation, don't have that major wake up call when they come to shut down
[30:39.360 --> 30:44.520]  your power and they shut down the stores in the food supply, have the backup, have the
[30:44.520 --> 30:49.880]  insurance and be ready to feed yourself, your family, your friends and your neighbors with
[30:49.880 --> 30:58.360]  the storable food, best quality, best price, 10% off right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[30:58.360 --> 31:03.000]  We told you it was coming under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore for eight
[31:03.000 --> 31:07.920]  months they made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that makes them a social distance
[31:07.920 --> 31:11.000]  and report them back to cell towers to track through every movement.
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.680]  This is for everybody, the way it gets better.
[31:13.680 --> 31:18.600]  Now France has programs in their factories, government, push and sponsor to make everyone
[31:18.600 --> 31:24.280]  wear actual dog collars, make social distance and report back to their computers.
[31:24.280 --> 31:26.600]  They're turning it into a commodity.
[31:26.600 --> 31:30.080]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years, it's all being announced.
[31:30.080 --> 31:35.240]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations
[31:35.240 --> 31:40.120]  downplay that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced.
[31:40.120 --> 31:41.120]  Do you understand?
[31:41.120 --> 31:45.520]  It is a takeover of the entire species at the genetic level and now they're coming with
[31:45.520 --> 31:49.880]  dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S. starting next year it will
[31:49.880 --> 31:50.880]  begin.
[31:50.880 --> 31:51.880]  Did you hear me?
[31:51.880 --> 31:55.840]  Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[31:55.840 --> 31:58.960]  Infowars continue to spread the word and fight back.
[31:58.960 --> 32:01.040]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[32:01.040 --> 32:08.840]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy and a lot
[32:08.840 --> 32:10.320]  of people just couldn't believe it.
[32:10.320 --> 32:14.640]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chest, 5G chest, he's invincible.
[32:14.640 --> 32:17.840]  And I understand why people aren't to believe that because this is scary what's going on.
[32:17.840 --> 32:21.240]  The global government in the New World Order and now that people hold up in techs that's
[32:21.240 --> 32:23.760]  real they won't somebody to come save them from.
[32:23.760 --> 32:24.760]  Well Trump sure is hell-trodden.
[32:24.760 --> 32:29.720]  My gosh, look it out, prescription drug prices just tripled for quadruple depending on the
[32:29.720 --> 32:32.040]  drug once Biden signed that executive order.
[32:32.040 --> 32:36.800]  We pay the most of anybody in the world, that's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump
[32:36.800 --> 32:41.160]  had reversed and now people are going to feel who's staying in the pain, the energy cost,
[32:41.160 --> 32:42.160]  everything else.
[32:42.160 --> 32:46.520]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers
[32:46.520 --> 32:51.200]  are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged
[32:51.200 --> 32:56.480]  in all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks, the swamp is deep.
[32:56.480 --> 33:01.240]  Trump fought it but it's up to us to win it.
[33:01.240 --> 33:28.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.080 --> 33:36.040]  We've got the Lieutenant General Russell Honoree who helped lead the unconstitutional criminal
[33:36.040 --> 33:43.080]  gun confiscation in Katrina back during George W. Bush and all his nightmare activity.
[33:43.080 --> 33:47.400]  Coming out last week, Tucker Carlson covered it, we covered it two weeks ago.
[33:47.400 --> 33:52.520]  Just in video conferences and in public statements and in tweets saying we need to just arrest
[33:52.520 --> 33:54.600]  Trump supporters, we need to kill them.
[33:54.600 --> 33:57.440]  We need to put them in FEMA camps, we need to put them on no fly list.
[33:57.440 --> 33:58.880]  We need to take their guns.
[33:58.880 --> 34:01.920]  I mean, this guy is a punk.
[34:01.920 --> 34:07.720]  This guy's an un-American thug but he's par for the course for the generals that they've
[34:07.720 --> 34:15.360]  got up there and so he's been prepared and is in charge now of this neupatorium guard
[34:15.360 --> 34:19.200]  of purging the U.S. military of, quote, white supremacy.
[34:19.200 --> 34:24.840]  That means anybody that supports Trump, anybody that supports America, anybody that supports
[34:24.840 --> 34:29.120]  the constitutional republic.
[34:29.120 --> 34:34.760]  And so Americans have to come to grips with that.
[34:34.760 --> 34:37.000]  They have to come, zoom in a little bit closer for me.
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.200]  I want to do with Dr. McCambs being on the article, just like boom, right there is what
[34:40.200 --> 34:41.200]  I want.
[34:41.200 --> 34:42.200]  Thanks.
[34:42.200 --> 34:44.720]  And so that's where we are as a republic.
[34:44.720 --> 34:46.560]  That's where we are as a country.
[34:46.560 --> 34:53.960]  And we have to ask ourselves, is this a good thing to have the Democrats in league with
[34:53.960 --> 34:59.760]  the Communist Chinese that are pushing open borders, cutting off our pipelines that are
[34:59.760 --> 35:03.760]  demoralizing our nation, that are telling us that men are going to compete in women's
[35:03.760 --> 35:08.560]  sports, that are just doing everything you can to wreck the psyche and morale of the
[35:08.560 --> 35:09.560]  people?
[35:09.560 --> 35:10.560]  Is that a good thing?
[35:10.560 --> 35:11.560]  And the answer is no.
[35:11.560 --> 35:16.040]  If we recognize it's an assault, if we recognize it's meant to break us up, if we recognize
[35:16.040 --> 35:19.920]  it's meant to make us kill each other, then we can override it and not have the civil
[35:19.920 --> 35:28.640]  war we want to avoid instead of laying down to the globalist.
[35:28.640 --> 35:31.480]  We don't want to lay down, we don't want to give them the civil war they want.
[35:31.480 --> 35:37.080]  We want to have a cultural awakening to them and fully resist everything they stand for
[35:37.080 --> 35:38.480]  and everything they do.
[35:38.480 --> 35:39.600]  It's that simple.
[35:39.600 --> 35:44.480]  So let me play to these two clips back to back right now.
[35:44.480 --> 35:51.880]  One is the police and the National Guard under General Russell Honorary's directive.
[35:51.880 --> 35:55.040]  Many years ago he's now been resurrected through this on an actual scale.
[35:55.040 --> 35:56.040]  Biden's got the bills introduced.
[35:56.040 --> 36:00.360]  He says he's going to move forward with executive orders outside of law, register all guns,
[36:00.360 --> 36:04.960]  confiscate all semi-autos, ban all magazines above nine rounds.
[36:04.960 --> 36:06.880]  I mean, it's all been announced.
[36:06.880 --> 36:10.600]  He says if Congress doesn't pass it within 60 days, executive order and we're off the
[36:10.600 --> 36:18.720]  road races and a weird crazy senile America hater is in charge of it all, then the next
[36:18.720 --> 36:22.960]  clip is the clergy response teams, they've gotten preachers all over the country on the
[36:22.960 --> 36:29.320]  federal payroll, little FBI badges, brainwashed that when the crisis goes down, tell you to
[36:29.320 --> 36:33.880]  take the microchip, tell you to take the vaccine, tell you to turn your guns in, tell you to
[36:33.880 --> 36:36.320]  go to the FEMA camp.
[36:36.320 --> 36:38.320]  And so that's what this is, is the takedown of the country.
[36:38.320 --> 36:42.400]  That's why they're on the news saying reeducate us, brainwash us.
[36:42.400 --> 36:50.320]  It's why they're on the news over and over and over and over again, teaching us that
[36:50.320 --> 36:53.240]  we're bad.
[36:53.240 --> 36:54.240]  This is a takeover.
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.680]  That's why they've cut the communications off, they're preparing to devalue the dollar,
[36:59.680 --> 37:00.680]  they're already doing it.
[37:00.680 --> 37:04.600]  I mean, we're in rough shape and I'm just not going to lie to you about it.
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.080]  It's not hard, but the Q movement neutralized him and said he's invincible, everything's
[37:09.080 --> 37:12.680]  fine, don't get involved to make sure while the left was active, you weren't.
[37:12.680 --> 37:16.120]  Now most of us thought he had to solve through it, but I keep hammering back to Q because
[37:16.120 --> 37:21.440]  you'll see next hour we expose the main propaganda group they used with antifa to take over a
[37:21.440 --> 37:23.480]  few right wingers to attack the Capitol.
[37:23.480 --> 37:26.440]  You understand how critical they are because they're planning to try to provoke a tour
[37:26.440 --> 37:30.680]  of more stuff on March 4th where they claim Trump's about to take over and be the president
[37:30.680 --> 37:31.680]  again.
[37:31.680 --> 37:40.280]  I assure you that's not the case, so we've got to kill the CIA globalist system that
[37:40.280 --> 37:41.280]  Q is.
[37:41.280 --> 37:45.720]  We've got to kill its credibility, not physically kill it, we've got to get people to understand
[37:45.720 --> 37:46.720]  what it really is.
[37:46.720 --> 37:50.560]  This is sophisticated saw-off because I know you want a bunch of good news, I understand
[37:50.560 --> 37:54.440]  that, but I'm not going to sit there and give you fake news, folks, okay?
[37:54.440 --> 37:57.160]  I'm going to give you the reality as best I know it.
[37:57.160 --> 38:07.520]  So here's the two clubs back-to-back, ABC and World News, September 8, 2005.
[38:07.520 --> 38:13.360]  That includes New Orleans, where today authorities stepped up their efforts to empty the city.
[38:13.360 --> 38:19.120]  Bob Woodruff is there again tonight with an extraordinary human drama unfolding, Bob.
[38:19.120 --> 38:21.000]  That's true, Elizabeth, and good evening from New Orleans.
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.640]  Here the police and the National Guard find themselves in a very difficult position tonight
[38:25.640 --> 38:35.680]  to try to carry out an order to force people from the city without actually using force.
[38:35.680 --> 38:40.640]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[38:40.640 --> 38:48.280]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans' driest and wealthiest neighborhoods, too.
[38:48.280 --> 38:53.880]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[38:53.880 --> 39:05.920]  They say there are no orders to use force just strong persuasion, sometimes entering
[39:05.920 --> 39:17.320]  open houses with guns drawn, and instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[39:17.320 --> 39:21.240]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners would arm themselves to
[39:21.240 --> 39:26.680]  carry out their orders.
[39:26.680 --> 39:29.280]  Later it came out on Fox News and our own reporters covered it.
[39:29.280 --> 39:34.120]  They went into high and dry areas, surrounding cities, took guns, robbed people's houses.
[39:34.120 --> 39:38.040]  The military did, and the police did later, the Louisiana police did.
[39:38.040 --> 39:40.760]  Not they're not all crooks, but again, they don't control the ones that are crooks, so
[39:40.760 --> 39:41.760]  they have to let them do it.
[39:41.760 --> 39:42.760]  Very corrupt.
[39:42.760 --> 39:43.760]  That's how it works.
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.440]  And so again, they did take everybody's guns, and they did not use force.
[39:47.440 --> 39:48.440]  That's all a damn lie.
[39:48.440 --> 39:51.280]  They're not paying as much as the old lady, they're taking the revolver from her.
[39:51.280 --> 39:54.880]  So let's imagine they took them out of their houses that were high and dry, made them go
[39:54.880 --> 39:57.000]  to the superdoms that could be gang-raped.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.760]  Let's continue.
[39:59.760 --> 40:00.760]  Arm anyone inside?
[40:00.760 --> 40:03.720]  You say guns will be taken?
[40:03.720 --> 40:04.720]  No one will be able to be armed.
[40:04.720 --> 40:06.800]  We will take all weapons.
[40:06.800 --> 40:10.680]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to
[40:10.680 --> 40:14.000]  protect their mansions.
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.960]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[40:15.960 --> 40:19.600]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[40:19.600 --> 40:24.160]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.560]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[40:28.560 --> 40:30.560]  city.
[40:30.560 --> 40:33.560]  This guard unit occupied a church using it as a base camp.
[40:33.560 --> 40:37.520]  They had to leave a note because they could not get hold of the pastor to get permission.
[40:37.520 --> 40:38.760]  It is surreal.
[40:38.760 --> 40:43.960]  You just never, you never expect to do this in your own country.
[40:43.960 --> 40:48.760]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[40:48.760 --> 40:52.560]  Walking up and down these streets, you don't, you don't want to think about the stuff that
[40:52.560 --> 40:53.560]  you're going to have to do.
[40:53.560 --> 40:56.840]  If somebody pops around the corner, let me shoot an American.
[40:56.840 --> 40:57.840]  Yeah.
[40:57.840 --> 41:00.920]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[41:00.920 --> 41:06.880]  Some fear any nuclear, biological or chemical attack on U.S. territory might trigger just
[41:06.880 --> 41:07.880]  that.
[41:07.880 --> 41:12.480]  NSKFLA News 12 Jeff Beall discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially
[41:12.480 --> 41:14.920]  their biggest problem, us.
[41:14.920 --> 41:18.200]  From my cold, dead hand.
[41:18.200 --> 41:24.240]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value, the overarching desire
[41:24.240 --> 41:26.200]  to protect our freedoms.
[41:26.200 --> 41:31.240]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane
[41:31.240 --> 41:32.720]  Katrina in New Orleans.
[41:32.720 --> 41:38.800]  U.S. troops also arrived, something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination
[41:38.800 --> 41:42.280]  of the 1878 Posse-Kamitatus Act.
[41:42.280 --> 41:47.600]  But forbid U.S. troops from policing on American soil.
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.040]  If martial law weren't acted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing
[41:52.040 --> 41:55.280]  public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[41:55.280 --> 41:59.800]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in
[41:59.800 --> 42:00.800]  New Orleans.
[42:00.800 --> 42:04.160]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over
[42:04.160 --> 42:07.800]  with and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[42:07.800 --> 42:12.480]  These Clergy Response Teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus
[42:12.480 --> 42:14.120]  the wishes of the public.
[42:14.120 --> 42:18.800]  In a lot of cases, these Clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're
[42:18.800 --> 42:20.840]  helping to diffuse that situation.
[42:20.840 --> 42:25.400]  For the Clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public
[42:25.400 --> 42:31.240]  down or obey the law is the Bible itself, specifically, Romans.
[42:31.240 --> 42:32.240]  Romans 13.
[42:32.240 --> 42:33.240]  That's enough.
[42:33.240 --> 42:38.080]  Romans 13, render into Caesar with Caesar, they were trying to trick Christ so they could
[42:38.080 --> 42:41.760]  kill him, saying, what, you're not going to pay taxes, Caesar's on this.
[42:41.760 --> 42:45.520]  He goes, render into Caesar that, which is Caesar, and later Paul quoted it.
[42:45.520 --> 42:48.600]  Hitler's favorite quote, Christ said, sell your cloak and buy a sword, these people
[42:48.600 --> 42:49.600]  want you disarmed.
[42:49.600 --> 42:53.800]  They've hired most of the criminal preachers, most churches are dens of Satanism run by
[42:53.800 --> 42:54.800]  potbellied pedophiles.
[42:54.800 --> 42:58.160]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[42:58.160 --> 43:04.440]  I sell supplements for two reasons, because they work, they're real, they're powerful,
[43:04.440 --> 43:06.640]  and because it's a giant market.
[43:06.640 --> 43:09.280]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[43:09.280 --> 43:10.780]  Because it works.
[43:10.780 --> 43:12.720]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[43:12.720 --> 43:20.960]  So whether it's Saupon Meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, Prostagard,
[43:20.960 --> 43:26.280]  or whether it is the super high grade organic vitamin B12 in old for 12, or whether it's
[43:26.280 --> 43:33.280]  the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force, or the pure deep breath crystal iodine on the X2,
[43:33.280 --> 43:39.720]  these are all the very best supplements you're going to find in already great market of high
[43:39.720 --> 43:43.040]  quality products out there, and it funds the InfoWare.
[43:43.040 --> 43:46.400]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're funding the InfoWare
[43:46.400 --> 43:47.400]  so you can't lose.
[43:47.400 --> 43:50.000]  InfoWare delivers in spades.

[43:53.680 --> 43:55.200]  you all for keeping us on air.

[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  days.

[44:09.000 --> 44:10.760]  I myself and my family use.
[44:10.760 --> 44:14.000]  And during the blackouts and freeze here in Texas, we were able to use food we bought
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.680]  from them years ago.
[44:15.680 --> 44:17.600]  Our supplier is my patron supply.

[44:22.840 --> 44:23.840]  the emergency.

[44:26.960 --> 44:32.760]  now said they're doing 10% off exclusively at preparewithallocs.com or infowarstore.com.
[44:32.760 --> 44:36.640]  That's preparewithallocs.com or infowarstore.com.

[44:53.840 --> 44:58.280]  Get prepared, get ready, and don't be dependent on the globalist.
[44:58.280 --> 45:02.600]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[45:02.600 --> 45:03.920]  I just love it.
[45:03.920 --> 45:05.600]  I can't get enough of it.
[45:05.600 --> 45:08.560]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[45:08.560 --> 45:09.760]  That's what fills my mug.
[45:09.760 --> 45:10.920]  That's what fills my belly.
[45:10.920 --> 45:12.480]  That's what fills my soul.
[45:12.480 --> 45:14.160]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[45:14.160 --> 45:18.640]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years at infowarstore.com.
[45:18.640 --> 45:19.640]  Years.
[45:19.640 --> 45:20.640]  Never raised the price.
[45:20.640 --> 45:21.640]  Never.
[45:21.640 --> 45:23.520]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee.
[45:23.520 --> 45:24.720]  The crew here loves it.
[45:24.720 --> 45:25.720]  We drink it every day.
[45:25.720 --> 45:30.840]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support InfoWars here.
[45:30.840 --> 45:32.960]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody.
[45:32.960 --> 45:37.720]  Why not support InfoWars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America
[45:37.720 --> 45:38.720]  Patriot Blend?
[45:38.720 --> 45:40.160]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[45:40.160 --> 45:41.720]  Pretty much perfect review there.
[45:41.720 --> 45:42.720]  4.9 star.
[45:42.720 --> 45:47.240]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody
[45:47.240 --> 45:48.240]  gets a five star.
[45:48.240 --> 45:51.120]  I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it a five star except
[45:51.120 --> 45:52.120]  maybe one or two people.
[45:52.120 --> 45:59.040]  Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available at infowarsstore.com.
[45:59.040 --> 46:02.400]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[46:02.400 --> 46:06.740]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[46:06.740 --> 46:11.440]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[46:11.440 --> 46:15.960]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com.
[46:15.960 --> 46:20.760]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[46:20.760 --> 46:26.480]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[46:26.480 --> 46:32.480]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[46:32.480 --> 46:39.120]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[46:39.120 --> 46:43.720]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[46:43.720 --> 46:49.680]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[46:49.680 --> 46:52.320]  facts that pertain to reality.
[46:52.320 --> 47:02.160]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[47:02.160 --> 47:17.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:17.240 --> 47:22.000]  Welcome back to the most censored, most lied about, most demonized broadcast in the world.
[47:22.000 --> 47:23.000]  We're teleprop for free.
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.840]  The globalists aren't telling me what to say.
[47:24.840 --> 47:25.840]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[47:25.840 --> 47:31.840]  Very, very honored to be joining you on this live Sunday of February 21st, 2020 transmission.
[47:31.840 --> 47:36.560]  Okay, I want to hit what really happened with the power outages.
[47:36.560 --> 47:37.560]  You know what?
[47:37.560 --> 47:38.560]  Darn it.
[47:38.560 --> 47:42.920]  I was just back in my office and then talked to my wife that called me and I forgot to get
[47:42.920 --> 47:43.920]  it.
[47:43.920 --> 47:44.920]  So will somebody do me a huge favor?
[47:44.920 --> 47:47.560]  Will somebody run into my office right in front of the computer?
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.000]  Is a stack of articles about that thick and just bring me that.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.880]  But you guys are quick enough and good enough.
[47:52.880 --> 47:58.280]  You guys can actually pull up the document that I want to show from the Department of
[47:58.280 --> 48:02.720]  Energy telling the state of Texas that they weren't going to turn the power on until they
[48:02.720 --> 48:04.200]  had a crisis.
[48:04.200 --> 48:06.280]  And the fact that the feds, there it is.
[48:06.280 --> 48:07.840]  So no need to go to my office now.
[48:07.840 --> 48:12.800]  We're actually in control of Texas energy.
[48:12.800 --> 48:13.800]  Simply incredible.
[48:13.800 --> 48:15.520]  Let's still grab it off my desk.
[48:15.520 --> 48:16.520]  Thanks.
[48:16.520 --> 48:18.160]  So that's coming up in just a moment.
[48:18.160 --> 48:19.160]  Smoking guns.
[48:19.160 --> 48:25.760]  Joe Biden, Department of Energy, blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of storm.
[48:25.760 --> 48:36.480]  Now, before we hit that and show you the document, it's so incredible to have this story we're
[48:36.480 --> 48:39.400]  going to cover at the start of the next hour.
[48:39.400 --> 48:44.560]  New York Times critical thinking isn't helping the fight against misinformation.
[48:44.560 --> 48:48.000]  That's an infowars.com posted story from information liberation.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.200]  You're thinking, oh, surely they didn't really say that.
[48:51.200 --> 48:58.280]  Here is a Charlie Wurzel, one of my stalkers, don't go down the rabbit hole.
[48:58.280 --> 49:01.440]  He says, the critical thinking is bad.
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.760]  He actually says, do not investigate.
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.240]  I always tell you, don't believe me, investigate.
[49:10.240 --> 49:14.440]  Don't believe me that India banned the Pfizer vaccine two weeks ago.
[49:14.440 --> 49:15.440]  Look it up.
[49:15.440 --> 49:17.160]  Hell, here it is right here.
[49:17.160 --> 49:18.920]  I'm going to show you next hour.
[49:18.920 --> 49:25.720]  These articles all over the world saying, I'm a liar because they discredit my name and
[49:25.720 --> 49:30.160]  then use me to discredit other things, like, Joe's claims India banned the Pfizer vaccine.
[49:30.160 --> 49:31.840]  It's not true.
[49:31.840 --> 49:36.520]  The story trended on Twitter is the number five trend and he needs to be arrested.
[49:36.520 --> 49:38.280]  He's going to kill people.
[49:38.280 --> 49:44.200]  Look at this, CNBC, February 5th, told you it's been two weeks.
[49:44.200 --> 49:46.240]  I'm just dead on my memory.
[49:46.240 --> 49:47.240]  Two weeks ago.
[49:47.240 --> 49:51.480]  Pfizer withdraws application for emergency use, was covered in 19 vaccine in India after
[49:51.480 --> 49:56.640]  India says it caused deaths and people to be paralyzed in their own studies and said,
[49:56.640 --> 49:57.640]  you can't do it.
[49:57.640 --> 50:02.080]  I'm going to show you the damn press release from the Indian government, because remember
[50:02.080 --> 50:06.360]  they were a colony of England, so they speak English over there.
[50:06.360 --> 50:07.360]  It's their main language.
[50:07.360 --> 50:08.360]  It's not India.
[50:08.360 --> 50:09.360]  It's in English.
[50:09.360 --> 50:10.360]  It's not a translation.
[50:10.360 --> 50:11.360]  It's in English.
[50:11.360 --> 50:14.360]  It's real easy to understand.
[50:14.360 --> 50:23.800]  Oh, but Charlie Wurzel, also known as the Weasel, he says, don't do it.
[50:23.800 --> 50:27.560]  So that's coming up next hour.
[50:27.560 --> 50:32.400]  And then I'm going to show you the exclusive video and audio thanks to the great work of
[50:32.400 --> 50:38.200]  investigative journalist Millie Weaver and others of hired CNN operatives running the
[50:38.200 --> 50:41.360]  capital assault on record.
[50:41.360 --> 50:42.800]  This is huge.
[50:42.800 --> 50:44.200]  The report is being prepared.
[50:44.200 --> 50:46.680]  We were shooting it up here this morning and this afternoon.
[50:46.680 --> 50:49.360]  We're adding so many clips, so much documentation.
[50:49.360 --> 50:50.720]  Everything I say will then show you a clip.
[50:50.720 --> 50:54.760]  I'm like, I talk five seconds, five second clip, talk to 10 seconds, 10 second clip,
[50:54.760 --> 50:56.160]  talk 30 seconds, 30 second clip.
[50:56.160 --> 50:58.520]  It's just total everything I say I show you.
[50:58.520 --> 51:00.800]  Oh, because I'm not like the New York Times.
[51:00.800 --> 51:03.520]  Oh, don't, don't research things.
[51:03.520 --> 51:04.520]  Don't look deeper.
[51:04.520 --> 51:05.760]  It'll hurt your mind.
[51:05.760 --> 51:07.680]  It'll make you confused.
[51:07.680 --> 51:08.920]  It's a thought crime.
[51:08.920 --> 51:09.920]  It's terrible.
[51:09.920 --> 51:14.080]  We don't want to have to be platform you or arrest you by the attorney general says if
[51:14.080 --> 51:17.160]  you don't like us, the government will arrest you.
[51:17.160 --> 51:22.440]  We've emptied out the prisons for you.
[51:22.440 --> 51:28.720]  So that's all coming up next hour.
[51:28.720 --> 51:35.880]  And I'm going to read from the Indian government saying because of people being paralyzed, palsy,
[51:35.880 --> 51:44.400]  death in the initial trials that they banned it.
[51:44.400 --> 51:45.960]  They said they've not approved it.
[51:45.960 --> 51:49.960]  Oh, well, I guess because it never got approved, it's technically not banned.
[51:49.960 --> 51:51.680]  What's the word for that?
[51:51.680 --> 51:52.680]  It's unauthorized.
[51:52.680 --> 51:56.000]  I'm sorry, Snopes.
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.440]  Just thank God I don't make a living lying to people like what must it be like the evil,
[52:01.440 --> 52:02.440]  the soullessness.
[52:02.440 --> 52:03.440]  That's why they're so desperate.
[52:03.440 --> 52:08.200]  They thought I saw fear so they can just lie to you and gaslight you forever.
[52:08.200 --> 52:10.920]  But let's move on to this.
[52:10.920 --> 52:13.600]  Any regular listener of the show doesn't have to believe me.
[52:13.600 --> 52:14.600]  You saw what Obama did.
[52:14.600 --> 52:18.000]  If that guy said, I meant to tell you this, I forgot, I apologize to the poor and battle
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  the crew.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.000]  They do a great job.
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.000]  Well, you guys pull up.
[52:21.000 --> 52:22.000]  Obama says he will bankrupt coal.
[52:22.000 --> 52:29.520]  Remember when he was running for office 15 years ago, he said, oh, you can build a coal
[52:29.520 --> 52:30.520]  power plant.
[52:30.520 --> 52:33.320]  We'll put a tax on it so high it'll bankrupt you.
[52:33.320 --> 52:37.280]  What that really means is we'll bankrupt the people.
[52:37.280 --> 52:39.200]  And coal power plants will operate the cold.
[52:39.200 --> 52:41.080]  You can turn them right on, turn them right off.
[52:41.080 --> 52:42.080]  It's totally clean.
[52:42.080 --> 52:47.080]  Only water vapor comes out with carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, plant spree.
[52:47.080 --> 52:48.080]  And there it is.
[52:48.080 --> 52:50.880]  President Obama keeps promise to bankrupt coal industry.
[52:50.880 --> 52:57.640]  But there's three speeches he gave where he said, we're going to bankrupt coal.
[52:57.640 --> 52:58.640]  And hell, Biden's doing it.
[52:58.640 --> 53:00.880]  He turned off the Keystone Pipeline, everything else.
[53:00.880 --> 53:01.880]  That's just oil.
[53:01.880 --> 53:02.880]  Can't have that either.
[53:02.880 --> 53:05.600]  It's just goes banning gas-powered stoves.
[53:05.600 --> 53:06.600]  Can't have gas either.
[53:06.600 --> 53:07.600]  Even though it's totally clean.
[53:07.600 --> 53:08.600]  Doesn't matter.
[53:08.600 --> 53:09.600]  Can't have that either.
[53:09.600 --> 53:13.960]  Got to buy electricity from them, wherever the hell they're getting it.
[53:13.960 --> 53:16.400]  So, smoking gun.
[53:16.400 --> 53:18.080]  Oh, yeah, there's the clip.
[53:18.080 --> 53:20.440]  When you got audio, let me know and I'll play it.
[53:20.440 --> 53:22.440]  Smoking gun.
[53:22.440 --> 53:26.680]  Joe Biden's Department of Energy blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of Killer
[53:26.680 --> 53:27.680]  Storm.
[53:27.680 --> 53:32.720]  You can go read it for yourself where it says, we need relief in the document.
[53:32.720 --> 53:40.040]  From the fact that the federal government won't let us increase the output at our coal
[53:40.040 --> 53:45.880]  power plants, at our hydroelectric plants, and at our gas-powered plants.
[53:45.880 --> 53:48.760]  And that the windmills froze up.
[53:48.760 --> 53:50.920]  And one reactor failed.
[53:50.920 --> 53:53.000]  Nuclear reactor, because they didn't want to rise it.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.400]  So you had all this going on.
[53:54.400 --> 53:58.360]  But the reason that the main thing happened, please put the document back on screen.
[53:58.360 --> 54:06.280]  The reason that the main thing happened is because they shut down over 120 power plants
[54:06.280 --> 54:09.840]  under Obama, and then they were always saying Trump was a Russian agent, was about to be
[54:09.840 --> 54:10.840]  out any moment.
[54:10.840 --> 54:13.600]  So Trump tried to get companies to turn back on in Texas.
[54:13.600 --> 54:18.200]  These to supply most of the country, at least 15 states, and they said, sorry, we don't
[54:18.200 --> 54:19.200]  think you'll be there.
[54:19.200 --> 54:20.640]  We're not going to turn back on.
[54:20.640 --> 54:23.640]  We think they'll remove you and somebody else will turn it off.
[54:23.640 --> 54:30.560]  And so we're operating on 40-year-old nuclear reactor, two reactors in Houston, just like
[54:30.560 --> 54:31.760]  the Russians were.
[54:31.760 --> 54:35.560]  We're operating on a bunch of scam windmills that are 300 miles from the main cities they
[54:35.560 --> 54:37.720]  supply, some of all the powers lost.
[54:37.720 --> 54:40.480]  We're operating on a bunch of natural gas stuff.
[54:40.480 --> 54:44.400]  And we bought natural gas because they're clean and healthy and they're what everybody
[54:44.400 --> 54:45.400]  says you should get.
[54:45.400 --> 54:47.200]  They're all the main line stores sell.
[54:47.200 --> 54:51.280]  And we have two of the damn things, and they wouldn't work, and they failed when all the
[54:51.280 --> 54:53.120]  power was off, the fully powers.
[54:53.120 --> 54:54.120]  You know what?
[54:54.120 --> 54:56.920]  I've got a big-ass diesel generator, and it worked great and got us back on air.
[54:56.920 --> 54:59.040]  But we already know that.
[54:59.040 --> 55:03.960]  Fossil fuels burn at the site clean and explosively, so they drive those pistons.
[55:03.960 --> 55:05.520]  They drive those turbines.
[55:05.520 --> 55:10.320]  They give you good, clean energy, like in your car, kind of driving around in some electric
[55:10.320 --> 55:16.080]  lawnmower that, by the way, took more fossil fuel to burn to send it down the power lines
[55:16.080 --> 55:17.880]  even if it's from windmills.
[55:17.880 --> 55:21.440]  The average windmill takes 20 years to pay for the carbon that went in it.
[55:21.440 --> 55:25.200]  And by the way, carbon didn't bad, it's what plants breathe.
[55:25.200 --> 55:28.480]  But they chose it because it's everywhere, and they can tax it and track it and control
[55:28.480 --> 55:29.480]  it.
[55:29.480 --> 55:31.960]  So, it's a big document.
[55:31.960 --> 55:32.960]  It's a big article.
[55:32.960 --> 55:33.960]  It's at infowars.com.
[55:33.960 --> 55:35.120]  I suggest you get it.
[55:35.120 --> 55:39.680]  I'm going to ask our great writer, Jamie White, who's up here on Sundays, to retake this article
[55:39.680 --> 55:46.000]  and repost it in the live show, Feed, so people can see the link and find it easily and read
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.680]  the document for yourself.
[55:48.680 --> 55:53.360]  The governor, begging them, let us please turn up these plants ahead of the storm getting
[55:53.360 --> 55:58.600]  here, and they said, no, not until your power fails and until you've been buying it from
[55:58.600 --> 55:59.600]  outside sources.
[55:59.600 --> 56:01.400]  By then, it was Sunday night.
[56:01.400 --> 56:07.360]  The power had been off in most areas, and it was too late, and then, oh, you're allowed
[56:07.360 --> 56:11.880]  to now up your carbon without fines or enforcement.
[56:11.880 --> 56:13.200]  And that's all in there.
[56:13.200 --> 56:18.240]  And then now Biden to come as the gracious lord and look at the pathetic Texas that everyone
[56:18.240 --> 56:22.840]  from around the country is running to to get away from him in the blue cities, and he can
[56:22.840 --> 56:26.040]  sit there and do that.
[56:26.040 --> 56:30.960]  So, when we come back next hour, we're pulling it in.
[56:30.960 --> 56:35.440]  I'm going to get you the clip of Obama saying, we're going to bankrupt the coal plants.
[56:35.440 --> 56:37.720]  But you already know that.
[56:37.720 --> 56:39.720]  And so, that's what caused this.
[56:39.720 --> 56:45.440]  Now, technically, it's true what Bill Gates said when he said, well, the main reason was
[56:45.440 --> 56:46.720]  the gas plants failed.
[56:46.720 --> 56:51.760]  Yeah, because the wind doesn't work, and two reactors didn't run the state of Texas, a
[56:51.760 --> 56:52.760]  nuclear reactor.
[56:52.760 --> 56:55.360]  They shut down the other ones, since they were too old.
[56:55.360 --> 56:59.160]  The Houston ones should be shut down, too, because they're supposed to only run 30 years.
[56:59.160 --> 57:00.960]  It's been running 42 years.
[57:00.960 --> 57:05.440]  And then, we have all these gas power plants that don't operate in the coal because it's
[57:05.440 --> 57:09.080]  not very powerful.
[57:09.080 --> 57:10.280]  I'm going to explain that again.
[57:10.280 --> 57:14.000]  We couldn't bring these generators in the office because they put off carbon monoxide
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  and kill us.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.480]  We had to put them outside.
[57:16.480 --> 57:22.920]  And in 20-degree weather, the damn things wouldn't work, and we're conking out forever.
[57:22.920 --> 57:27.080]  So we were off the air for a while after the batteries failed, until we basically waited
[57:27.080 --> 57:29.280]  until a place opened that had generators.
[57:29.280 --> 57:31.880]  They were closed, went and paid a measure to get one.
[57:31.880 --> 57:32.880]  It's unbelievable.
[57:32.880 --> 57:34.720]  I'm going to show it all to you when we come back.
[57:34.720 --> 57:40.080]  I'm going to play you the Obama-Biden is the same person, the same global situation.
[57:40.080 --> 57:44.040]  The country's under attack, China has plenty of power, they're shutting our power off so
[57:44.040 --> 57:45.240]  they can't do business.
[57:45.240 --> 57:48.240]  Hour two straight ahead.
[57:48.240 --> 57:57.200]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[57:57.200 --> 58:01.600]  Even before I had an access to this show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and
[58:01.600 --> 58:02.920]  thought, man, that looks fun.
[58:02.920 --> 58:07.600]  In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[58:07.600 --> 58:08.600]  because you're real.
[58:08.600 --> 58:10.600]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[58:10.600 --> 58:14.680]  We're not worthy, we're not worthy.
[58:14.680 --> 58:18.560]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because
[58:18.560 --> 58:21.720]  these topics are so huge or so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[58:21.720 --> 58:23.880]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[58:23.880 --> 58:29.520]  The globalists love lying to you, they love manipulating you, they enjoy destroying humanity,
[58:29.520 --> 58:34.320]  they enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[58:34.320 --> 58:36.520]  That for me is really such a discussion.
[58:36.520 --> 58:42.600]  So you've got to pledge for myself and all of them for a worse crew, that we will never
[58:42.600 --> 58:43.600]  join the globalists.
[58:43.600 --> 58:48.640]  We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[58:48.640 --> 58:54.400]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy,
[58:54.400 --> 58:56.520]  food, and medicine.
[58:56.520 --> 59:01.320]  And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal
[59:01.320 --> 59:06.440]  and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people lined up.
[59:06.440 --> 59:11.520]  lined up at the few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned
[59:11.520 --> 59:14.200]  away after hours of freezing in the cold.
[59:14.200 --> 59:18.160]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power
[59:18.160 --> 59:20.160]  in their house and then running out of gas.
[59:20.160 --> 59:24.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water
[59:24.960 --> 59:25.960]  as well.
[59:25.960 --> 59:28.760]  They're both available the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality
[59:28.760 --> 59:34.320]  storeable foods right now, massively discounted because of this emergency for everybody nationwide
[59:34.320 --> 59:40.240]  at infowarstore.com, $50 off on our best stainless filter and tempers thought off all storeable
[59:40.240 --> 59:43.480]  food in all packages at infowarstore.com.

[59:51.720 --> 59:57.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:57.360 --> 1:00:03.440]  For those trapped in the frozen bureaucratic hell in Texas known as the 2021 winter storm,
[1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:08.400]  a world where the leadership failed beyond imagination, the largest lesson learned from
[1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:13.760]  those that endured the experience is that if they can't manage a full scale natural
[1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:19.080]  and energy disaster, what makes anyone think that they can manage our lives with their
[1:00:19.080 --> 1:00:24.400]  build back better, great reset takeover of all human existence, build back better than
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:31.640]  before, build back better, build back better, and build in back better, build back better.
[1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:38.080]  The second plank in build back better advances racial equity by mobilizing our infrastructure.
[1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:41.880]  Together we can fix this, let's build back better.
[1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:46.680]  Political parasites in Texas like Austin Mayor Steve Adler, who hid for the first three
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:50.200]  days until the media scared him out of his hole.
[1:00:50.200 --> 1:00:57.080]  I've talked to some folks down in Austin who their frustration about it is they're not
[1:00:57.080 --> 1:01:04.280]  getting any information about okay, when is restoration coming, what is the situation.
[1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:10.680]  It seems as if residents have a grasp of the power situation, but people feel they don't
[1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:12.560]  have a grasp on the water situation.
[1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:13.560]  What can you do?
[1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:17.960]  We don't have any good answers because we can't give people in exact time when the water's
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:19.840]  going to be able to come back.
[1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:22.360]  What's the situation in Austin right now?
[1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:26.200]  It's pretty dire in the city right now.
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:30.040]  It needs to explain what it is that happened here.
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:35.400]  While Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Abbott revealed a disconnect few expected, realizing
[1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:37.640]  zero on the ground initiative.
[1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:41.640]  This week has been hell for the state of Texas.
[1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:46.640]  It has been two storms on top of each other, four million Texans lost power, no power,
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:48.760]  no lights, many with no water.
[1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:49.760]  It has been frustrating.
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:55.360]  I'll tell you, Sean, a lot of Texans are mad or pissed off, and so last night I flew
[1:01:55.360 --> 1:02:00.200]  down with them to the beach, and then I flew back this afternoon.
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:04.720]  I had initially planned to stay through the weekend and to work remotely there.
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:07.400]  And I want to let you know what these experts told us.
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:15.120]  They said five days before the winter storm hit, ERCOT assured that, quote, we are ready
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:17.760]  for the cold temperatures coming our way.
[1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:24.040]  They also said that ERCOT had issued a notice to power plants to ensure that they were winterized
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:25.520]  properly.
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:33.240]  And ERCOT's annual winter assessment, which was designed to ensure the state is prepared,
[1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:39.560]  that assessment assured the public of Texas that there would be enough power to meet peak
[1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:40.880]  demand this winter.
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:46.160]  Now, what happened is ERCOT fell short on all three of these promises they made.
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:54.280]  Meanwhile, as the streets and temperatures remained frozen.
[1:02:54.280 --> 1:03:00.840]  All right, this is one of Bound's longer reports.
[1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:01.840]  Water, boots.
[1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:02.840]  It's about seven minutes long.
[1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:03.840]  It's at Band.video.
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:04.840]  I suggest you share it.
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:05.840]  It gets really powerful.
[1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:11.080]  It explains what's really behind this is Dark Winter Hell at Band.video.
[1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:15.600]  Click the left-hand corner and just find the John Bound area, and you'll find those
[1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:16.600]  reports.
[1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:22.080]  And again, this is one of the shows where I over-prepared.
[1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:23.880]  My wife understands now.
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:28.480]  I just basically work all the time now, and I'm not complaining.
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:32.120]  But then I get up here, and I'm already so angry and so frustrated, and I've already read
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:36.760]  so much of this, that I just feel like I'm not doing a good job constantly, and I'm mad
[1:03:36.760 --> 1:03:37.760]  at myself.
[1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:41.920]  And then I protect that on the crew, on air, and off air, and I'm a jerk, so I apologize
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:42.920]  for being a jerk.
[1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:46.880]  At a certain point, too, ladies and gentlemen, most people would run and hide, okay?
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:47.880]  And I get it.
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:48.880]  The public keeps running and hiding.
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:50.040]  My crew isn't running and hiding.
[1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:51.300]  You're not running and hiding.
[1:03:51.300 --> 1:03:54.760]  We just have to start putting heat on these people legally and lawfully.
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:04:00.600]  But I want to start getting some whooping in on their butt politically, because they've
[1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:04.320]  been attacking us, and they've been bankrupting us, and they've been hurting us, and I want
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:08.480]  to get on the offense against them, because they killed over 50 people in Texas, and they
[1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:12.480]  shut the damn power off, and the governor of Texas, here's the takeaway.
[1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:18.760]  We know that they shut down under Obama over 120 power plants in Texas, and so Gates is
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:21.920]  right that technically it's because the gas plants failed.
[1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:26.120]  That was the final reason, because we get most of our damn power from natural gas, because
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:27.800]  it's what's plentiful and cheap.
[1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:30.080]  It just doesn't work as good.
[1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:32.480]  It'll cook your eggs.
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:36.960]  It'll make a nice fireplace for you, but it doesn't explode in an engine right to drive
[1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:42.320]  pittsons or turn a freaking turbine, and it sure as hell doesn't work in the cold.
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:45.320]  Only diesel and gasoline powers through it.
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:49.680]  I think the Germans have diesel, it's even better than gas.
[1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:50.680]  The damn cold.
[1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:57.280]  If the other stuff doesn't work, we're right back.
[1:04:57.280 --> 1:05:03.240]  Finally, we're seeing major state governments in the United States running TV and radio
[1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:10.240]  ads saying everybody take your vitamin D3, take your zinc, and take your C. It's essential

[1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:14.480]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:14.480 --> 1:06:20.480]  Well, radio listeners can find the video posted at band.videoandnewswords.com and infowords.com.
[1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:24.600]  TV viewers on a lot of radio and a lot of TV stations, a lot of cable stations out there
[1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:26.600]  can see it.
[1:06:26.600 --> 1:06:28.600]  But I had an idea for a video meme.
[1:06:28.600 --> 1:06:29.600]  It's only a minute long.
[1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:33.520]  Greg Reese had a great job voicing it, one of our great researchers here.
[1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:36.720]  And it's simply America is running on one engine.
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:40.880]  You had that big passenger liner coming in.
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:42.480]  I guess it was United.
[1:06:42.480 --> 1:06:45.040]  One of the engines caught on fire, blew up.
[1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:50.040]  Dramatic footage of the fuel, the jet fuel, the kerosene spilling into the engine.
[1:06:50.040 --> 1:06:54.760]  They were able to land it safely.
[1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:56.920]  America is operating on one engine right now.
[1:06:56.920 --> 1:06:58.320]  We have people that are awake.
[1:06:58.320 --> 1:06:59.320]  We have the states.
[1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:05.480]  We have some conservative nationalistic populist courts, but that engine's starting to smoke.
[1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:08.360]  And now Joe Biden's cutting the power off to it.
[1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:13.640]  And so when I saw that engine on fire like that, there's a reason you want your plane
[1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:18.440]  to have two engines, whether it's prop plane or whether it's a jet engine.
[1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:21.000]  You know, smarter folks, you don't have three engines.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.560]  One up the top, two on the sides, where you have four engines or six engines.
[1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:27.960]  I'm not going to get 18-wheelers got more tires because, you know, when you have a blowout,
[1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:29.960]  you don't die every time.
[1:07:29.960 --> 1:07:33.560]  When you're going 75 miles an hour down the highway with a big load, with great power
[1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:34.920]  comes great responsibility.
[1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:36.960]  Better have more wheels, better have more engines.
[1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:41.800]  But just the allegory of that burning engine of your radio listener, just have that in
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:47.360]  mind while Greg Reese lays it out.
[1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:51.960]  The image of this airplane's engine burning in flight is quite the allegory for this very
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:55.680]  moment in time for the United States of America.
[1:07:55.680 --> 1:08:01.240]  After his first month as president, Joe Biden has canceled the Keystone Pipeline, terminating
[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:07.240]  thousands of jobs and raising fuel prices, suspended protection of our bulk power grid,
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:13.280]  which has already been infiltrated by the CCP, nodded presidential support for the CCP's
[1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:19.640]  strong army of Hong Kong, Chinese death camps, and the Uyghur genocide, rejoined the Paris
[1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:26.320]  Climate Accord to further destroy U.S. industry while China's industry burns at full throttle,
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:32.680]  and rejoined the CCP-run World Health Organization, pushing the COVID-19 hoax.
[1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:36.400]  The federal government has completely fallen to the CCP.
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:39.160]  America has lost one of its engines.
[1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:44.160]  It is now up to our one remaining engine, the states, to pull us up before we crash,
[1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:47.440]  or at the very least, give us a good landing.
[1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:51.560]  And I wrote that, so that's not his words.
[1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:59.720]  I should have said God is our remaining engine, and we've got to call out to God to get ourselves
[1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:02.920]  politically active, to lead God and direct us and then reach out to the legislatures,
[1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:09.040]  local communities, our churches that aren't completely controlled, and say no to this.
[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:12.680]  I mean, this is out of control.
[1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:16.920]  And if you look at a report Greg Rees and I put out two weeks ago, long before the storm
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:22.520]  hit, we said next we'll be rolling blackouts and power shortages around the country because
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:27.880]  of regulations Joe Biden's putting in, and that's the formula, and that's what happened.
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:30.120]  These psychos act the same over and over again.
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:32.360]  It's why people are like, God, Jones, you're so smart.
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:33.360]  Your guests are so smart.
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:35.920]  How do you know this?
[1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:39.960]  How do cops, how do detectives that have been following a serial killer for 10, 15, 20 years
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:44.160]  finally catching on the scene when he's killing somebody?
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:48.760]  Because they've been tracking them for 20 years, folks, and they start to see patterns.
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:50.480]  And it's the same thing with these globalists.
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:55.120]  And then they write books and white papers admitting they're shutting off the US to teach
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:59.280]  us political control, to teach us how to be poor, and to make us be dependent on the state
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:01.520]  so they can make us become globalists.
[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:06.040]  They admit they want to confiscate all your semiautomatics, including hunting shotguns.
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:09.440]  It's all being announced.
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:14.560]  And so I'm sorry it's this topic, but only admitting how much trouble Wren's going to
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:15.560]  fix it.
[1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:17.400]  Now, they're just now finishing the report.
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:19.240]  It ends up it's 20 minutes long.
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:21.320]  That'll be the last two segments.
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:22.440]  And they're racing to get it done.
[1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:24.720]  It's got so much documentation on it.
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:27.040]  I just hope it's ready for the show today.
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:33.200]  But man, I'm telling you, we have cracked the case, it's come out that the Democrats
[1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:36.040]  and the Deep State ran the capital attack.
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:41.400]  They were able to manipulate and provocateur through Q, not the Q-Shawm himself, but the
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:43.960]  Q priests.
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:46.320]  These Q drops were put out on H&N.
[1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:51.480]  And then the people were manipulated believing that it was actually Trump.
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:56.960]  And so we now know that it was Antifa, the Southern Primary Law Center, train groups.
[1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:01.120]  And others in control of the H&N operation that did this.
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:04.240]  And it's just unbelievable.
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:06.720]  And of course, now people are like, oh, Jones, don't worry about it.
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:07.720]  Oh, really?
[1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:11.040]  It's in like a thousand publications that they want the FBI to have me indicted for
[1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:13.120]  saying I ran the attack on the capital.
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:15.360]  Just absolutely perfect.
[1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:17.080]  And this has all just come together in the last few days.
[1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:21.000]  That CNN was paying the main guy that led it, along with what NBC.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:25.480]  And of course, Lindsey Graham, I was talking to folks very close to Trump.
[1:11:25.480 --> 1:11:29.520]  And Trump was getting ready to go on the offense and give a speech.
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:33.520]  Not just at CPAC, but I was told Trump was getting ready to speak about what Lindsey
[1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:36.920]  Graham told him that Pelosi did know the Democrats were involved.
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:38.720]  This is all getting ready to come out.
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:45.400]  And so now as soon as Trump was found not guilty, they moved on to Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:50.120]  And so when I tell you I'm on the inside of this thing, I'm on the inside of being set
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:54.040]  up and then trying to send me to prison.
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:57.480]  But we found out very quickly what they were doing and tried to stop what happened at the
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:11:58.480]  Capitol.
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.920]  We definitely were able to mitigate what happened, but that is all coming up at the bottom of
[1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:04.920]  the hour.
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:07.360]  33 after we come out of that break, we're going to premiere.
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:10.720]  It's not even going to be on Band-Aid video yet, hopefully soon after, so you can share
[1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:11.720]  it.
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:21.280]  The fact that Democrats admit to staging and launching the January 6 Capitol attack.
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:22.320]  They called it insurrection.
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:24.680]  It was a dud, it failed.
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:30.240]  They fooled enough Q people, former high-level FBI, former high-level military, to actually
[1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:31.240]  believe they were working for Trump.
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:32.240]  And so they were there with zip ties.
[1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:34.920]  They were like, where's the special forces?
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:35.920]  Where's the people?
[1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:37.280]  We're here to arrest Pelosi.
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:38.280]  Trump's coming.
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:43.160]  So they tricked Trump to say, go have an event, go have a peaceful protest, and march to the
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:44.160]  Capitol.
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:51.400]  Then they set up for the Q operators, well-meaning people believing that they were actually going
[1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:54.080]  to save the country with Trump in a violent overthrow.
[1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:58.320]  And then they kept the PR going, oh, it's going to happen on the 20th, you know, Biden
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:00.000]  will be executed on the stage.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.880]  I'm like, it's not true.
[1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:02.880]  It's a lie.
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:04.040]  It's a setup by them.
[1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:06.120]  They want permanent troops.
[1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:12.680]  And thank God we were able to snatch a whole bunch of their operatives that they had infiltrated
[1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:19.560]  in the Boogaloo's, the Oath Keepers, and in the Proud Boys, which are not bad organizations,
[1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:27.040]  the Oath Keepers, and the Proud Boys, and the Boogaloo's aren't even bad people on average,
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:31.040]  but even though they admit they take Antifa in and Antifa's now using them, but that's
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:36.160]  the groups they use through those groups online to tell them they were part of this big overthrow
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:39.120]  and that it was all magic and it was all this great moment with Trump.
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:44.640]  And so they got just like six people from Oath Keepers, three or four from the Proud
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:51.200]  Boys to go in after Antifa broke through and to go into the Capitol and the Q people were
[1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:52.200]  all swaggering.
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:53.400]  Hell, Trump's about to be here.
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:54.800]  They're all going to prison.
[1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:56.560]  You know, they set a prayer at the dais.
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:13:58.920]  They walked between the velvet ropes.
[1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:01.720]  Maybe 20 people were violent.
[1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:03.360]  And they were like, hey, we're here with Trump.
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:04.360]  It's all right.
[1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:05.360]  Cops, we're on your side.
[1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:06.360]  We're about to.
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:08.240]  And so the media didn't know how to spin it.
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:09.640]  First they're like, oh yeah, it was all pre-planned.
[1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:10.640]  They go, wait a minute.
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:12.960]  We're blaming Trump saying he incited it.
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:15.400]  So then when he wasn't convicted of that, which Trump had no idea what was going on,
[1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:20.120]  he was set up like I was, then they had to shift gears and go, okay, it is a pre-planned
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:22.960]  group and it's Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:24.080]  You got a problem.
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:27.320]  You ran your fat mouths in the Time Magazine article.
[1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:30.320]  And then we caught your people on tape admitting they did it.
[1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:36.440]  So get ready, get ready, get ready, throw me in that briar patch.
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:41.160]  Because it's all coming out, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:44.800]  It's just like in Arlington Road, how they set up Jeff Bridges' character to be there
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:46.320]  when the bomb goes off.
[1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:49.520]  He's there thinking he's stopping the bomb, but he ends up being lured to the site to
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:50.520]  be blamed for it.
[1:14:50.520 --> 1:14:51.800]  And so that's how these groups operate.
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:53.600]  It's very sophisticated.
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:55.920]  But here's the problem of complex plans.
[1:14:55.920 --> 1:14:57.280]  They often go astray.
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:00.440]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:01.720]  And that is exactly what happened here.
[1:15:01.720 --> 1:15:05.560]  It was supposed to be big, it was supposed to be a shootout, it was supposed to be arresting
[1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:09.160]  Pelosi, supposed to go engage the Capitol Police.
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:13.840]  And then notice now, General Honore blamed the Capitol Police.
[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:16.400]  So that's the one part I forgot to put my report.
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:18.600]  General Honore's like, they're all white supremacists.
[1:15:18.600 --> 1:15:21.560]  They were in on it.
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:22.560]  Can you believe that?
[1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.280]  Because they know that they were ordered to stand down, that Pelosi had a report two
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:27.440]  weeks before, a week before, the day before.
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:30.640]  They want to have the purges, the military, and police.
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:32.840]  So Honore probably was in charge of all this.
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:36.600]  And that's what the research points that with the Southern Bobby Law Center, CIA and others.
[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:39.520]  That's the groups that run this, that are connected, CNN, heavily involved us at that
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:40.520]  day one.
[1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:44.520]  Now we know they paid the main commander that went in with the CNN reporters embedded.
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:49.760]  And that's why Honore doesn't want to get in trouble himself, so he's blaming the police.
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:51.360]  What a traitor, what a sack of filth.
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:52.360]  We'll be right back.
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:53.360]  Stay with us.
[1:15:53.360 --> 1:16:01.280]  The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent.
[1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:08.560]  With millions left without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents
[1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:11.520]  are left without food.
[1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:16.760]  The lines of the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:19.800]  shelves are left bare.
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:27.880]  Now we know that in the most historic record-freezing temperatures in over a century, your government
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:34.840]  can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:40.080]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:46.840]  Go to infoorstore.com and get at least a year's supply of storable foods to make sure you
[1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:51.160]  and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[1:16:51.160 --> 1:16:56.400]  Get your storable foods at infoorstore.com.
[1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:03.400]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:04.720]  that this is all a test.
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:10.680]  This experience, this waifundness planet is a reckoning.
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:15.960]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:20.240]  where we want to spend eternity, to what level we want to go to, and it really does come
[1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:21.240]  down to that.
[1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:25.320]  So as fat as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:29.600]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:33.200]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:38.800]  God is the author of us having free will, and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:43.000]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:48.320]  DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:52.000]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in a bad, because Satan
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:56.560]  hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[1:17:56.560 --> 1:18:01.600]  We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:05.240]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:09.360]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:14.000]  it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:15.840]  euphoric effects.
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:21.240]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:25.560]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:30.240]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:31.560]  loosen up a little.
[1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:36.360]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:42.360]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:48.480]  herbs including but not limited to, German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balarian
[1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:49.480]  root.
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:56.480]  We expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:19:49.480 --> 1:20:17.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:17.960 --> 1:20:26.160]  John O'Mein folks, you just want to go out and forget this whole new world over exists.
[1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:31.640]  They're going to come for you on your farms, they're going to come for you on your ranches,
[1:20:31.640 --> 1:20:37.000]  they're going to come for you in your businesses and in your schools and your churches, they're
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:41.880]  going to come for you in your homes, in your gun safe, in your pocketbook, and they're
[1:20:41.880 --> 1:20:42.880]  not going to stop.
[1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:47.000]  They're going to come for you in your children's minds and souls.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:51.640]  And so I worked yesterday and today on this report that they are transferring over right
[1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:55.000]  now to our computers that they just finished, hopefully to be ready by the start of the
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  next segment.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:59.800]  It's about a 19-minute report, total error here in the time we have left.
[1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:05.240]  But if it doesn't, it'll error during Sunday Live at Owen Host that even has half the commercials
[1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:07.160]  because we only do local commercials.
[1:21:07.160 --> 1:21:12.200]  I'm syndicated through GCN, I still love them, they're good guys, so I let them still have
[1:21:12.200 --> 1:21:13.200]  network ads.
[1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:17.080]  If I had my druthers, I'll be the first talk show host ever to get rid of network ads where
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:21.440]  the stations have all the ads and we have none and we just do a short plug each hour
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:25.120]  live on air like all the other hosts do every segment.
[1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:26.920]  We do it about once an hour.
[1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:32.280]  But because that show is not syndicated over GCN, we're able to only give you six minutes
[1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:38.960]  of ads an hour, whereas we have the average for talk radio 14 minutes, but regardless,
[1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:45.000]  it'll be posted to band.video and it needs to go viral because the Democrats have confessed
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:46.280]  the stage of the Capitol attack.
[1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:50.640]  And I remember when it happened, I said, why is General Onuray, the guy that did the gun
[1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:59.360]  confiscation in Katrina, on the news on January 6 saying the police are complicit and they're
[1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:00.360]  white supremacists?
[1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:05.800]  I mean, the Capitol police are very professional, very politically correct, and about half of
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:06.800]  them are black.
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:10.000]  I mean, that's just crazy.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:11.720]  They were told to go do traffic control.
[1:22:11.720 --> 1:22:12.920]  They had half their regular number.
[1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:17.440]  The city of DC, the district is in control of them, that ought to change.
[1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:20.520]  I think the feds ought to have their own police there.
[1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:26.640]  And a couple hundred people were able to break in and the police showed restraint.
[1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:29.880]  And then when other people came in, once the crowd started coming in, because they didn't
[1:22:29.880 --> 1:22:32.560]  know what just happened, a hundred yards in front of them, I didn't know what was going
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:33.560]  on.
[1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:39.960]  In fact, then once there's hundreds more coming in, okay, the cops shook hands, took selfies,
[1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:43.200]  and those people stayed within the velvet ropes.
[1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:48.200]  We've got all this other big news here, folks, but there's 30,000 National Guard troops
[1:22:48.200 --> 1:22:50.440]  stationed there basically permanently.
[1:22:50.440 --> 1:22:53.080]  Biden says the mass never comes off even if you had the vaccine.
[1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:55.920]  He said that Friday at Pfizer.
[1:22:55.920 --> 1:22:57.680]  This is a serious takeover.
[1:22:57.680 --> 1:22:58.680]  This is martial law.
[1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:02.600]  But when you're wearing a face diaper, keep your piehole shut, you're in a tyranny.
[1:23:02.600 --> 1:23:04.120]  You're in a science fiction movie, brother.
[1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:08.560]  When you're not allowed to criticize it online or you'll get banned, even if you're a medical
[1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:10.720]  doctor, you're not in a free country anymore.
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:16.680]  And they're mopping up the final OACs, the final watering holes of truth.
[1:23:16.680 --> 1:23:19.840]  And InfoAware is one of the biggest, last standing organizations.
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:23.040]  It's been a great honor to serve with all of you here.
[1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:25.720]  Today could be our last show next week, next month.
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:30.480]  But there's a quickening happening where more people are listening than ever had before.
[1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:32.720]  And it's magic what's going on.
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:34.240]  I don't care about Hollywood.
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:35.920]  I don't care about being part of the power structure.
[1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:37.520]  I don't live in LA or New York.
[1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:40.200]  I don't try to be close to the power.
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:43.560]  But the people that aren't part of the power structure, but that are popular, they love
[1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:44.560]  my show.
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:49.560]  I think my show is unwatchable half the time, but the biggest names out there love my show.
[1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:52.720]  I know Rush Limbaugh was told, listened every night.
[1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:55.160]  I know Matt Drudge listens basically 24 seven.
[1:23:55.160 --> 1:23:59.480]  I know that other people, the big guy on Fox is a big listener and a big viewer.
[1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:00.480]  I'll leave it at that.
[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:04.040]  I talked to him just the other day and it goes on and on.
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:09.560]  Stephen Crowder, the list goes on and on and but listen, that's not a power trip for me.
[1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:14.200]  That is a great honor and it shows and I'm only giving a report card to you, the boss,
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:17.320]  the listeners, the providers, the ones that keep us on air.
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:21.120]  Thank you for what you've done because I'll be steadfast again.
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:22.240]  I just want to fight the globalist.
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:23.680]  I want to defeat them.
[1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:26.920]  I have an absolute commitment to stop them.
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:32.200]  But instead of it creating a power trip, I just feel terrible because we're not doing
[1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:34.360]  more to turn the tide and I'm just very frustrated.
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:37.360]  But out of that frustration, I know we're going to get the victory we need.
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:38.360]  So let me show you this.
[1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:41.880]  Since I mentioned it, I don't want to just say something and then not show it to you
[1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:46.360]  because this is the one thing I've forgotten the report coming up.
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:51.080]  General Honor Ray, who's running the gun confiscation national threat assessment plan
[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:55.520]  to go after the American people who says we need to put millions of Trump people in prison,
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:24:58.840]  take our guns, put us on no fly list, arrest members of Congress.
[1:24:58.840 --> 1:25:05.240]  I mean, this guy's like Hitler reborn or something, but I guess it's okay because his great-great-great-great-grandfather
[1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:06.240]  was black.
[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:10.000]  Again, it looks about as black as the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:11.960]  They're like, Tom Brady's racist.
[1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:12.960]  He beat him.
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:16.080]  It's like seeing Elizabeth Warren as a Native American.
[1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:23.640]  Anyways, the point is General Honor Ray wants your guns and we already showed you last hour
[1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:29.040]  how you ran the confiscation in Katrina many, many years ago.
[1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:36.080]  But now, look at this headline, Russell Honor Ray Pelosi's pick for capital security review
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:42.280]  claimed police were complicit in the riot and six police are under criminal investigation
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:48.200]  because when a mob of people came up to one guy and want to take a photo, he doesn't know
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:49.200]  what's about to happen.
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:50.200]  It's okay.
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:51.200]  I'll take a photo.
[1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:52.200]  They ordered the stand down.
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:53.520]  So how is the individual officer to blame?
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:54.520]  It's not true.
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:55.520]  It's a fraud.
[1:25:55.520 --> 1:25:58.840]  But, see, Honor Ray knows that Pelosi was warned.
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:01.320]  Honor Ray knows Time Magazine bragged they knew it was coming.
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:02.320]  They know they infiltrated.
[1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:03.320]  He knows this.
[1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:05.520]  He's the type of guy probably in command of it.
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:08.320]  Hell, he ran gun confiscation in Katrina.
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:14.080]  He's an America hating, gun hating, God hating sack of garbage.
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:17.440]  The general, they want to lead the takedown of America.
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:23.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have met your Benedict Arnold, General Russell Honor Ray, a disgusting
[1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:24.240]  joke.
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:30.720]  And here he is saying, the police, remember he said, why?
[1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:36.120]  He goes up to 30% of the Capitol police are white.
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:40.840]  It's like Cartoon Network has a PSA telling children to seek color and to become anti-racist
[1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:44.600]  preachers and that white shouldn't exist.
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:50.040]  Man, I mean, this is sick Civil War garbage, folks.
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:51.040]  So he wants me arrested.
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:52.280]  I bet he does.
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:53.280]  I don't care.
[1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:54.280]  You piece of filth.
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:26:57.520]  You're the one who should be arrested for gun confiscation in Katrina.
[1:26:57.520 --> 1:26:58.520]  You monster.
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:02.680]  Why don't you stop Obama sex-trapping and kids that just started back up on the border.
[1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:04.920]  That's the Senate report, you little monster.
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:09.880]  Walk around with your beret on, your glasses, your cigar, like your George Patton.
[1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:11.800]  You didn't go up against the Nazis.
[1:27:11.800 --> 1:27:15.120]  You went up against the American people and took their guns when they were freezing in
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:16.120]  their houses.
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:17.120]  You traitor.
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:18.120]  You enemy.
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:20.360]  There's another enemy.
[1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:24.600]  Our Islamic lord-in-chief in his third term dismantling the country.
[1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:27.440]  Now he's got an old front man to do it.
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:35.240]  Barack Obama saying in 2012, 2013 that he's going to get your coal and going to turn your
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:38.080]  power off and he did it and that's why you're in the cold.
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:39.080]  Here it is.
[1:27:39.080 --> 1:27:44.120]  Let me sort of describe my overall policy.
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:50.280]  I mean, what I've said is that we would put a cabin trade system in place that is as
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:53.560]  aggressive, if not more aggressive than anybody else is out there.
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:58.360]  I was the first to call for 100% auction on the cabin trade system, which means that
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:06.480]  every unit of carbon or greenhouse gas that was emitted would be charged to the polluter.
[1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:12.320]  That will create a market in which whatever technologies are out there to be presented,
[1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:17.120]  whatever power plants that are being built, that they would have to meet the rigors of
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:24.120]  that market and the ratcheted down caps that are placed imposed every year.
[1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:27.160]  So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:32.280]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for
[1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:36.160]  all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:37.560]  And where does the money go?
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:40.960]  He actually owes the Chicago Mercantile Exchange part for carbon.
[1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:41.960]  That's right.
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:46.120]  The Clintons and Obama and the Rothschilds make the money.
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:49.080]  Oh, isn't that cutesy-putsy?
[1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:50.640]  We'll be back with a big special report.
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:51.640]  We've cracked the case.
[1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:55.840]  The Democrats admit they launched the attack on the capitol.
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:29:02.440]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government, but world government
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:04.760]  is only the control grid.
[1:29:04.760 --> 1:29:10.760]  Now, intermembers of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[1:29:10.760 --> 1:29:16.040]  and attain immortality, but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:19.480]  of all carbon-based line forms.
[1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:21.600]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[1:29:21.600 --> 1:29:25.320]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the Atlantic.
[1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:27.200]  They are playing God.
[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:33.960]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:37.000]  to carry out this transformation.
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:41.320]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalists, it's all on
[1:29:41.320 --> 1:29:42.400]  record.
[1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:44.840]  You have been warned.
[1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:49.360]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[1:29:49.360 --> 1:29:53.000]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:56.440]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[1:29:56.440 --> 1:29:58.000]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:01.800]  Now is the time to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to be shipped to you within
[1:30:01.800 --> 1:30:02.800]  days.

[1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:14.360]  years ago.

[1:30:54.320 --> 1:30:56.320]  on the globalist.
[1:30:56.320 --> 1:31:03.320]  The entire new older system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making
[1:31:03.320 --> 1:31:07.800]  you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image
[1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:13.080]  of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have, being given free will.
[1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:19.160]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[1:31:19.160 --> 1:31:23.880]  an entire system, and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're
[1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:28.360]  able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty
[1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:32.680]  of your wife, your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[1:31:32.680 --> 1:31:33.680]  of music.
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:38.520]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that itself
[1:31:38.520 --> 1:31:41.440]  is what God teaches us, is worship.
[1:31:41.440 --> 1:31:46.360]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in the
[1:31:46.360 --> 1:31:51.960]  system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God, and appreciate your consciousness,
[1:31:51.960 --> 1:31:56.400]  and appreciate pre-speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[1:31:56.400 --> 1:32:01.720]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there, about looking at
[1:32:01.720 --> 1:32:05.640]  the world from the perspective of the globalist, that if the public's so dumbed down that
[1:32:05.640 --> 1:32:08.800]  they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them,
[1:32:08.800 --> 1:32:12.160]  that we're sterilizing them, then they deserve to be killed.
[1:32:12.160 --> 1:32:16.600]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists, they play God, and they think because we don't
[1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:19.600]  stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[1:32:19.600 --> 1:32:23.560]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me, they've tried to get
[1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:29.600]  me to join them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit, I'm the connection
[1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:34.360]  to God, and I know that God is not like that, so I cannot join the enemy, but I'll tell
[1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:39.680]  you at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system believing
[1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:42.920]  you're part of it, or believing you're getting power on it.
[1:32:42.920 --> 1:32:47.240]  Whether you're just a steel worker, or a school teacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not
[1:32:47.240 --> 1:32:53.040]  God, and treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the
[1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:59.480]  real God of the universe doesn't like, and that's a fact.
[1:32:59.480 --> 1:33:09.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:09.920 --> 1:33:17.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:19.760]  Well so does he.
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:24.760]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:29.240]  Lieutenant General Russell Honore has been brought out of retirement by President Obama
[1:33:29.240 --> 1:33:34.920]  and Nancy Pelosi to prepare to prosecute war and gun confiscation nationwide.
[1:33:34.920 --> 1:33:40.520]  He is now saying that they have six police officers are suspended, the Capitol 35 under
[1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:45.960]  investigation claiming they launched the attack on the Capitol when all evidence is the Democratic
[1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:50.040]  Party launched it, you're about to see that evidence, that's why Senator Graham said what
[1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:54.680]  did Pelosi know, when did they know it, it's why they jumped the Trump trial a week
[1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:59.560]  early, we have to go public, we have to expose them, they're trying to frame us for the operation
[1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:03.320]  they launched, here is the incredible proof.
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:08.920]  Mark your calendars, ladies and gentlemen, we now know who pre-planned the attack on
[1:34:08.920 --> 1:34:19.160]  the US Capitol from their own words, because again, criminals love to brag.
[1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:25.200]  I never thought I'd be in a real live episode of Magnum PI or Colombo, I guess Perry Mason
[1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:28.760]  comes to mind, but I am.
[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:33.960]  National headlines everywhere the last two days, Alex Jones and Roger Stone under criminal
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:40.480]  investigation to see if we pre-planned the Capitol insurrection attack.
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:45.440]  Now let's unpack that here for just a moment and then I'm going to give you the big news,
[1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:51.040]  we actually know exactly who carried out the pre-planning of the Capitol attack on January
[1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:57.240]  6th and we have it from their own words in print and on video and with audio, we're
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:04.960]  going to show you who took credit and who got $70,000 from CNN and from NBC, so that's
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:10.240]  all coming up in a moment, but first let me briefly address the claim by the Washington
[1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:18.640]  Post and others that Roger Stone and myself are some of the chief suspects in the pre-planned
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:35.520]  attack on the Capitol.
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:45.240]  We were told by all the Democratic leaders, by the entire corporate media, not just here
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:51.000]  but across the world, that President Trump summoned a mob of a million violent criminals
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:56.200]  to D.C. to illegally challenge the U.S. election, if you're not supposed to do that, and that
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:01.480]  he then directed them to attack the Capitol and all one million went in and ransacked
[1:36:01.480 --> 1:36:06.240]  and murdered people and it was the most violent thing that happened on U.S. soil since Pearl
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:07.240]  Harbor.
[1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:11.160]  Chuck E. Schumer and others called it Pearl Harbor, they compared it to World War II,
[1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:17.000]  they compared it to 9-11 and they said that again it was not premeditated, President Trump
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:21.280]  was the only one that premeditated it by getting that crowd there and then hyping them
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:24.400]  up as a rabble rouser to attack the building.
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:29.400]  But he was acquitted over a week ago in the U.S. Senate because there was no evidence
[1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:33.720]  of this, they played all the video, the Democrats standing up there saying things far worse
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:38.720]  than Trump even dreamed of saying, like Cuomo saying, whoever said riots are peaceful and
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:42.200]  Pelosi saying burning things down is just what people do.
[1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:50.160]  President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7, 1941 as a day that will live in infamy.
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:58.400]  Unfortunately, we can now add January 6, 2021 to that very short list of dates in American
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:03.080]  history that will live forever in infamy.
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:07.400]  And please, show me where it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful.
[1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:09.400]  People will do what they do.
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:13.800]  You're in the arena, you've got to be ready to take a punch and you've got to be ready
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:15.320]  to throw a punch.
[1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:19.400]  There's hundreds of those clips, we all know them, and so they had to acquit him.
[1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:23.760]  And the ink wasn't dry on Trump's acquittal until they turned around and said, actually
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:27.040]  it's Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:31.680]  They're the ones that captained and field marshaled this entire operation, and it was
[1:37:31.680 --> 1:37:32.680]  premeditated.
[1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:38.480]  By John Chilger said, we're not burning buildings down or shooting cops, we're building America
[1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:42.480]  up, we're here to take our rightful country back peacefully.
[1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:50.400]  You guys are great, but the police, provocateurs have caused a problem, and the police are
[1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:51.400]  throwing frostbanks.
[1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:54.560]  We don't want to have a Kent State here.
[1:37:54.560 --> 1:37:57.280]  So let's get into the evidence right now.
[1:37:57.280 --> 1:38:01.840]  Coming up, I'm going to show you where the establishment Democrats bragged in Time Magazine
[1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:06.560]  just two weeks ago that they indeed set up Trump supporters on the 6th.
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:11.840]  But before we get to that piece of smoking gun evidence, let's look at one of the main
[1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:15.280]  leaders of the insurrection at the Capitol.
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:17.360]  So how was this lady shot?
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:23.840]  I mean, she was in, trying to get through the door, and was it, did you see who shot
[1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:24.840]  it?
[1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:31.000]  Yeah, so I was getting to that part, so immediately after they started breaking through the glass,
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.680]  once they broke through the glass, they were using like flagpoles and whatever they had
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:38.240]  to kind of bash through the windows.
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:42.160]  On the right hand side, this lady was able to like make her way all the way through the
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:43.520]  window.
[1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:50.480]  All we see is these guns come out the doorways, just guns, and all you can see is their hand,
[1:38:50.480 --> 1:38:55.240]  that's it, you can see faces, and right when I saw that, I was yelling to people, I was
[1:38:55.240 --> 1:38:58.240]  like, guys, there's guns, there's guns, you don't want to go through there, like there
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:03.160]  were, you know, like there was a sheet, like not just like hold it there and run away, they
[1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:07.200]  were literally going to shoot you to kill, the second that she climbed through the window,
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:12.040]  she got shot like right in the neck area, fell backwards.
[1:39:12.040 --> 1:39:15.880]  Meet John Sullivan, aka Jaden X.
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:21.200]  His father is a famous U.S. military general, on the morning of January 6th, Jaden X was
[1:39:21.200 --> 1:39:25.760]  recorded over and over and over again saying, we're going to go to the Capitol and we're
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:35.840]  going to burn it down, but that didn't stop CNN from saying he was an innocent bystander
[1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:41.440]  and a journalist, and it didn't stop CNN and other news outlets from secretly paying him
[1:39:41.440 --> 1:40:05.520]  $70,000, that finally came out in court just last week.
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:10.480]  The CNN connected film crew that followed Jaden X to the Capitol was blown away, they
[1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:15.360]  couldn't believe that his boast of inventing the Capitol and its exceeding came true.
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:21.360]  Jaden X had been boasting online and to hundreds of people in the streets that he indeed had
[1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:25.880]  helped online plan the attack on the Capitol, and when confronted with it, he didn't even
[1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:29.680]  deny it, he said that was another one of his personalities.
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:36.080]  You can disassociate yourself, I have John Sullivan, I have Jaden X, that separates,
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:41.640]  I have insurgents USA, civil rights organization, and it's not just Jaden X, many other known
[1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:47.680]  leftist activists from around the country came to DC and posed as Trump supporters and
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:49.880]  helped rile up the crowd.
[1:40:49.880 --> 1:40:53.640]  While Trump was still speaking a mile and a half away at the ellipse outside the White
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:41:00.600]  House, already over 100,000 people had showed up at the Capitol and observant patriots noticed
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:06.160]  it, in the grass, in the bushes, behind the trees, people wearing all black people with
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:13.360]  anti-fustile dress and gear were putting on MAGA gear, putting on Trump gear.
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:18.280]  And this again is just more evidence of how the left didn't overtly show up to confront
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:29.760]  Trump supporters that day, they simply blended in and added to the hysteria.
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:35.160]  In October of last year, investigative journalist Millie Weaver, who had been tracking the sunrise
[1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:41.400]  project for more than two years, that's basically a college-level George Soros Democratic Party
[1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:45.960]  funded group that teaches ANTIFA and BLM tactics.
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:51.160]  Millie got dozens of hours from an inside whistleblower of this organization planning
[1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:57.120]  to carry out the exact type of insurrection that then took place on January 6th.
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:03.720]  Our undercover, inside the Sunrise Movement, was able to obtain exclusive video footage
[1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:11.480]  inside Zoom chats where shut down DC, BLM and other leftist organizations are coordinating
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:18.800]  a multi-level co-action exercise utilizing insider help from Democrat Party members as
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:23.120]  well as federal employees and intelligence contractors.
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:28.120]  I'm an Management and Programs Analyst.
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:30.440]  We're going to come back because we have the audio where they admit that we're going to
[1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:36.440]  go stage the Capitol attack and we're organizing online, we're going to blame the Republicans.
[1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:39.920]  I mean, wow, this is all just now coming out.
[1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:42.320]  It was just Millie got new stuff.
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:43.920]  All right, it's all coming up.
[1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:48.920]  Next segment, infowars.com, newswars.com, the full thing will be posted in the next 15
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:49.920]  minutes to band.video.
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:52.640]  So share it if you want to stop the globalists.
[1:42:52.640 --> 1:42:56.480]  This is Kryptonite to the New World Order.
[1:42:56.480 --> 1:42:58.560]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:05.400]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:07.800]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[1:43:07.800 --> 1:43:12.200]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:15.080]  And I understand why people are going to believe that because this is scary what's going on
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:17.080]  with the global government, the New World Order.
[1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:20.240]  And now that people have built up the facts that's real, they will try to come save them
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:21.240]  from.
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:22.800]  Well, Trump sure has held pride.
[1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:27.240]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled, depending on the
[1:43:27.240 --> 1:43:29.440]  drug once Biden signed that executive order.
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:31.400]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:34.920]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed.
[1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:38.960]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything
[1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:39.960]  else.
[1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:44.160]  But what really illustrated this is the trial of the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:48.880]  attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:54.040]  sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks, the swamp is deep.
[1:43:54.040 --> 1:43:56.400]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[1:43:56.400 --> 1:44:02.160]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy,
[1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:04.240]  food, and medicine.
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:09.040]  And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal
[1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:15.560]  and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people lined up at the few grocery
[1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:20.480]  stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned away after hours
[1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:21.920]  of freezing in the cold.
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:25.920]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:27.880]  in their house and then running out of gas.
[1:44:27.880 --> 1:44:32.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:33.680]  as well.
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:36.800]  They're both available to highest quality water filtration and the highest quality storeable

[1:44:55.120 --> 1:44:56.120]  A few more days.
[1:44:56.120 --> 1:44:57.120]  The resistance.video.
[1:44:57.120 --> 1:44:58.120]  The resistance.video.
[1:44:58.120 --> 1:44:59.120]  The resistance.video.
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:00.120]  The resistance.video.
[1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:17.000]  The resistance.video.The resistance.video.The resistance.video.The resistance.video.InfoWars.com.NewsWars.com.Band.video.And
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:20.520]  hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:26.040]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:38.080]  But the new website is theresistance.video.The resistance.video.They're trying to block us
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:41.200]  because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:46.680]  So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:52.080]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at theresistance.video.Share
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:59.240]  the link.Theresistance.video.The resistance.video.In the early 1990s, there was a really funny
[1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:05.720]  movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:10.800]  Even before I had access to the show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought,
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:11.800]  man, that was fun.
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:16.280]  In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:17.280]  because you're real.
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:19.280]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:23.360]  We're not worthy.We're not worthy.
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:27.200]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:29.160]  these topics are so huge or so real.
[1:46:29.160 --> 1:46:30.360]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[1:46:30.360 --> 1:46:32.560]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:34.200]  The globalists love lying to you.
[1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:35.560]  They love manipulating you.
[1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:38.200]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:43.000]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:45.520]  That for me is really such a disgusting.
[1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:51.600]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew that we will never join
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:52.600]  the globalists.
[1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:59.120]  We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:05.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:05.320 --> 1:47:16.440]  It's a final segment of my Sunday show, I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central Lord Willing.
[1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:21.000]  Owen Schroeder takes over two hours for Sunday Live, and he's going to end the last five
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  minutes of this report.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:26.640]  We'll have time to air about eight, nine minutes of it now, then he'll air at the very start
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:31.440]  of his show, the conclusion of this report, and in about 20 minutes or so, it'll be posted
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:32.440]  to band.video.
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:36.560]  We just finished it 20 minutes ago or so.
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:41.440]  Democrats confess to staging the Capitol attack on January 6th.
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:44.840]  They're so criminal, they're bragging about it, it's smoking gun, it's all come out in
[1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:48.840]  the last week, and all the final pieces with Millie Weaver's help, she's always been a
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:51.840]  great journalist, have come together.
[1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:55.480]  So let's go ahead and finish with as much as the report as we can get to, and then it
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:59.600]  will be posted to band.video where if you share it on your email, your text message,
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:03.360]  your word of mouth posted on your own site, it will shake the globalist with their very
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:07.240]  foundations because they're launching a new civil war and a martial law takeover on the
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:08.240]  back of this lie.
[1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:09.240]  Here it is.
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:12.680]  I'm a management and programs analyst.
[1:48:12.680 --> 1:48:15.720]  I work in the national security community.
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:22.560]  I spent three and a half years as a contractor at DHS HQ.
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:28.480]  If you read the mainstream press, they all have signal accounts, text them, leak everything
[1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:29.480]  you can.
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:35.200]  Journalists I've dealt with have been super ethical in ways to shield me to be the source
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:36.200]  of the leaks.
[1:48:36.200 --> 1:48:42.400]  Groups on the outside being able to show solidarity with federal workers, making sure that we're
[1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:45.840]  naming what is happening as a coup.
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:50.240]  Totally agreed in the shut down DC conversations that I've been having and that's not on the
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:51.240]  federal side.
[1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:54.000]  We also are often saying that we'll call it a coup.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:49:00.400]  They plan to shut down Washington DC and other major U.S. cities starting November
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:03.240]  4th until Inauguration Day.
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:06.440]  Do we have any plans for how to respond if there's a coup?
[1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:11.440]  Come to BLM Plaza any time after 4 p.m. on election night.
[1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:14.520]  The fifth, we're going to shut down the White House.
[1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:19.280]  Matt, the White House didn't know every access point, so we knew we could have blockaded.
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:24.120]  On the sixth, we're going to shut down larger parts of Washington DC.
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:27.400]  We've been working on a target map and a framework for scenario.
[1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:30.040]  So where are all the police stations?
[1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:32.040]  Where are all the key government buildings?
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:34.120]  Who are the Trump boosters?
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:38.080]  Members of Congress, they're coming in, we're going to meet up at the airport or at Union
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:43.800]  Station and send them back to where they came from until we deal with the situation
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:44.800]  that we're in.
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:49.400]  We're going to be in a crisis, but we want it to be one that we are creating.
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:51.480]  Whoever's got the guns can win.
[1:49:51.480 --> 1:49:53.200]  Let's take over the buildings.
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:56.280]  If there are people that are willing to do that, we should support them.
[1:49:56.280 --> 1:49:58.840]  Get ready to shut your city down on the fourth or the fifth.
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:03.240]  Regardless of who wins, the left plans to take over.
[1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:07.520]  And then on the ninth of the sixth, Millie Weaver was able to actually confront Jayden
[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:08.520]  X.
[1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:15.680]  Hey, so were you, yeah, are you BLM?
[1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:19.440]  Are you Black Lives Matter John?
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:20.440]  Can you just answer?
[1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:25.000]  Are you Black Lives Matter with Black Lives Matter or are you with the right-wing people?
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  But are you Black Lives Matter?
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.680]  Notice he uses the mask to cover himself.
[1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:35.880]  So he just said on the phone that he is not being charged with anything.
[1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:38.040]  Did you say you weren't being charged with anything?
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:40.760]  I thought I heard you say that.
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:44.600]  Are you Black Lives Matter, John?
[1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:51.480]  I'm of the opinion that what we saw yesterday was very much by design, that we did have
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:54.120]  agent provocateurs.
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:56.080]  And I'm of the opinion that you're one of them.
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:50:57.080]  Interesting.
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:50:58.080]  Really interesting on that.
[1:50:58.080 --> 1:50:59.560]  Why do you think I'm one of them?
[1:50:59.560 --> 1:51:01.120]  Because you're your father's.
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:02.680]  Your father's Syops, man.
[1:51:02.680 --> 1:51:05.080]  So you've met my dad, okay?
[1:51:05.080 --> 1:51:08.960]  So kind of further elaborates my point.
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:13.760]  He just explains to you because I know people are going to storm the Capitol.
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:14.760]  I'm on chats.
[1:51:14.760 --> 1:51:15.760]  I'm on underground chats.
[1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:17.520]  Like, I have my resources.
[1:51:17.520 --> 1:51:18.520]  I have my resources.
[1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:21.760]  There's not me, but I have people, right?
[1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:25.000]  And I'm not saying some fucking cop-type shit.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:32.400]  I'm saying my people and my organization, Surgeons USA, was civil rights group that is
[1:51:32.400 --> 1:51:37.320]  Black Lives Matter, or if you want to label it in Tifa, because Trump wants to label it
[1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:42.600]  in Tifa, but I label myself as a surgeon, to say, but for people's context, right?
[1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:45.640]  Yeah, they air in chats.
[1:51:45.640 --> 1:51:49.840]  They can easily get me information on what's going on and staying with everybody else.
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:51.640]  But it's a collective of people.
[1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:53.600]  You can disassociate yourself.
[1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:55.120]  I have John Sullivan.
[1:51:55.120 --> 1:51:58.040]  I have Jaden X. That separates.
[1:51:58.040 --> 1:52:00.480]  I have Surgeons USA, civil rights organization.
[1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:05.920]  So it separates my, I separate my identity based on the specific role that I'm playing,
[1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:06.920]  right?
[1:52:06.920 --> 1:52:07.920]  Is there really a separation?
[1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:08.920]  There is a separation.
[1:52:08.920 --> 1:52:14.960]  There is a separation, for sure, because I can't, I can't be in a crowd full of Trump
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:20.120]  supporters and say fuck the police or, or, or say the things that I would during my regular
[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:22.840]  activism.
[1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:28.400]  Now we've looked at some of the smoking gun, caught red-handed bombshell evidence of the
[1:52:28.400 --> 1:52:33.120]  Democratic party, Soros and the deep state manipulating the crowd.
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:37.320]  We're going to look at one more piece and then we're going to get to the really sad
[1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:43.160]  information, the fact that some of the best organizations in the past in this country,
[1:52:43.160 --> 1:52:48.160]  when it came promoting freedom, were infiltrated, and it's important to go over this to understand
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:53.760]  the truth of what happened so it won't happen again, observing Antifa over the last decade
[1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:54.760]  or so.
[1:52:54.760 --> 1:52:59.720]  We know they're funded by the UN, by George Soros, by the Democrats in deep state to undermine
[1:52:59.720 --> 1:53:04.520]  America, attack free speech, and call anybody that doesn't support that a racist in a Nazi.
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:08.760]  They are the equivalent of the left's brown shirts, just like Hitler had those as he
[1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:12.400]  stormed a power in the early 1930s in Germany.
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:18.000]  But we got a document back in January of 2018 from a family member of high-level Antifa,
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:23.480]  when he was taking care of him in his house and was able to see the shocking information.
[1:53:23.480 --> 1:53:28.200]  And in the documents that are on screen, they talked about how Obama wanted to trigger
[1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:36.160]  martial law nationwide back in 2015, and even put troops in Maryland, by using Antifa to
[1:53:36.160 --> 1:53:41.240]  go out and try to provoke the black community into rioting and burning down police stations
[1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:42.760]  and government buildings.
[1:53:42.760 --> 1:53:44.040]  They failed.
[1:53:44.040 --> 1:53:48.800]  And so the chain reaction did not take place, and Obama didn't get to stay in office using
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:54.480]  martial law, but that's what Antifa are specialists at and experts.
[1:53:54.480 --> 1:53:58.560]  They even have maps when they go into an area of where they're allowed to attack, what they're
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:53:59.560]  going to do.
[1:53:59.560 --> 1:54:04.880]  And it's always done in blue cities and blue states, where they're actually working with
[1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:11.400]  the mayors and chiefs of police to go out and carry out this low-intensity terror, knowing
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:14.400]  that they have a get out of jail free card and they're not going to get in trouble.
[1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:19.160]  And if they do get arrested, the charges are almost always dropped, and their bail is paid
[1:54:19.160 --> 1:54:24.480]  for by the Democratic Party, George Soros, and of course, Hollywood.
[1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:27.960]  And I want to make clear that I know that there are protests still happening in major
[1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:29.160]  states across the United States.
[1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:32.920]  I just not seeing the reporting on it that I had for the first few weeks.
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:34.960]  But they're not going to stop.
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:35.960]  They're not going to stop.
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:41.120]  And this is a movement I'm telling you, they're not going to stop.
[1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:45.640]  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop, they're not going to stop before
[1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:49.560]  election day in November, and they're not going to stop after election day.
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:54.280]  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels, that they're not going
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:56.080]  to let up, and they should not.
[1:54:56.080 --> 1:54:57.320]  And we should not.
[1:54:57.320 --> 1:54:59.480]  So think about that.
[1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:03.560]  A couple hundred people go into Capitol, maybe 20 of them are somewhat violent, defecate
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:05.880]  on the floor, beat up some police.
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:06.880]  Nobody's defending that.
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:12.040]  But they're calling this a Pearl Harbor event, when you had whole swaths of the U.S. burned
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:19.440]  down, and you had the now vice president helping bail people out that, again, attacked police
[1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:21.520]  and burned down police stations.
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:23.400]  And we've only scratched the surface here.
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:29.840]  You've got a former high-level FBI top security clearance commander of FBI operations.
[1:55:29.840 --> 1:55:33.480]  That's confirmed, leading the assault.
[1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:40.360]  You've got the son-in-law of Nancy Pelosi inside.
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:45.600]  And then you've got the cue boards, again, saying, oh, don't worry, Trump's coming back.
[1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:51.040]  The real inauguration is March 4th, so they can hopefully manipulate some more people into
[1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:52.440]  doing something violent.
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:55.680]  This is extremely dangerous, as you can all see.
[1:55:55.680 --> 1:55:59.640]  And as I'm now experiencing, as the entire mainstream corporate media tries to frame
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:06.080]  myself and Roger Stone and others for what they themselves actually orchestrated on January
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:07.320]  6th.
[1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:12.080]  Now as Paul Harvey would say, here is the rest of the story.
[1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:13.560]  I like Oathkeepers.
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:14.560]  I know Stuart Rhodes.
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:16.480]  They have a constitutional mission.
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:19.400]  He's a great guy and doesn't want offensive violence.
[1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:20.520]  He wants to defend the Republic.
[1:56:20.520 --> 1:56:22.800]  And most Oathkeepers are great.
[1:56:22.800 --> 1:56:27.680]  But through the cue movement and through these message boards that Jayden X was talking about,
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:32.560]  they were able to pose as right-wingers through some of the cut-out militia groups like the
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:34.520]  Bugaloo's and others.
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:40.560]  And were able to go into Oathkeepers, go into Proud Boys, and go into some of the cue groups
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:45.880]  and actually organize people who believe they were coming to the Capitol waiting for Trump
[1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:50.520]  to actually show up and lead them in a takeover of the government.
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:52.200]  It's the last five-minute conclusion.
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:53.280]  It's the key to all of it.
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:55.360]  The full video will be posted.
[1:56:55.360 --> 1:56:56.600]  It's being uploaded right now.
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:56:57.600]  It's HD.
[1:56:57.600 --> 1:56:58.600]  It takes a while.
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:56:59.600]  To band.video.
[1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:03.400]  It's so critical to get this out.
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:06.440]  And I'll probably do another video just on how they're trying to set the police up and
[1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:07.440]  claim they were involved.
[1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:08.440]  No, no.
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:11.160]  It's the police on top that were involved that ordered the stand-down.
[1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:15.240]  Now they want to scare the Capitol Police and, I guess, kill a few others or make them
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:16.240]  commit suicide.
[1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:17.240]  So this doesn't come out.
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:18.640]  But we are going to expose the Capitol Police.
[1:57:18.640 --> 1:57:20.040]  They did a great job.
[1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:22.920]  And they were under a sci-op, physical globalist attack.
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:25.560]  And we're very sad for the office of that art attack and died.
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:26.560]  We were not with the leftist.
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:27.560]  All right.
[1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:28.560]  Owen Shroyer is coming up.
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:29.880]  We'll finish the report at the start.
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:36.040]  He takes over with your phone calls and more infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video.
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:40.200]  Share that live feed and just thank that local station because they're so precious.
[1:57:40.200 --> 1:57:41.200]  God bless you all.
[1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:42.200]  I'll see you back at 11 a.m. tomorrow.
[1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:58.680]  But Owen Shroyer is coming up.
