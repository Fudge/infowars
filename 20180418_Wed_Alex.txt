[00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:24.292]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:29.573]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, what an incredible time to be alive.
[00:00:29.573 --> 00:00:38.255]  Anybody tells you that things aren't very exciting and that amazing things aren't happening is either completely stupid or they're living on another planet.
[00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:42.535]  Here's just some of the headlines and news I've got in front of us.
[00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:50.438]  There's a huge internal war going on inside the White House between the Hawks and the people that don't want thermonuclear war.
[00:00:50.438 --> 00:00:53.619]  I'd say between the Hawks and the Super Hawks.
[00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.080]  It's not like Mattis is a dove.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:05.924]  But the sane Hawks, peace through strength, and the foaming at the mouth types, like Nikki Haley, who is dumbered in a box of rocks, and a mistake that Trump ever put her in there.
[00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:09.145]  Well, when they came out and said the President never said sanctions,
[00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:13.349]  You're mistaken.
[00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:17.211]  She said, I don't get confused.
[00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:24.875]  And now we know Mattis has been overruled by Trump being manipulated by Bolton.
[00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:27.637]  We got a warmonger in the henhouse, folks.
[00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:29.197]  And of course, Nikki Haley.
[00:01:29.197 --> 00:01:33.239]  And look how much disrespect they have for the president out there shooting off their mouths.
[00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:37.942]  And the left are calling for war, war, war, war, war, because that's so liberal.
[00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.907]  Simply insane.
[00:01:40.907 --> 00:01:49.694]  So, and we've got internal sources in the Pentagon and in the White House, and they say this fight is just raging right now.
[00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:53.817]  And the media, you notice, went, oh, Trump's approval rating's up because he launched a war.
[00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:54.958]  It was always up.
[00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:59.682]  But they let them actually have a real poll for a week or so to manipulate the president.
[00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:03.645]  We've been down this road before.
[00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:15.380]  Then continuing, there's a report out, it's on Infowars.com, Mexico agrees to pay for the wall, offering emergency deal to close down NAFTA tariff loophole.
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.261]  That's coming up.
[00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:21.457]  Also, we've got critical reports.
[00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:35.001]  EU chiefs over the, quote, integration of Europe with the rest of the world say they want 200 million Africans, not to mention other separate groups they're bringing in, in the next 30 years brought in in forced integration
[00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:44.861]  This is their words, and they say it will cause civil war, and will cause the welfare state to collapse, but it's the right thing to do.
[00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:51.645]  Well, how about we just transplant 200 million Europeans, there's only 300 million in Europe, into North Africa?
[00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:53.406]  Oh, that would be an invasion!
[00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:54.527]  That would be genocide!
[00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:56.108]  That would be gentrification!
[00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:57.169]  That would be the end of the world!
[00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:03.733]  But, when the left says, okay, our plan is to break down the borders, just like they've done with the Arab Spring, that's why that's so critical to stop,
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.064]  And do this, but what's amazing is, why would Macron and others come out of the head of the EU program and admit it all?
[00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:12.486]  Because they know I'm exposing it.
[00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:15.228]  They know the president of Hungary is exposing it.
[00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:17.509]  They know Nigel Farage is exposing it.
[00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.031]  And they know, well, okay, we can't just let them expose it.
[00:03:20.031 --> 00:03:23.634]  We've got to go ahead and get out ahead of it, throw it out there, and admit the whole thing.
[00:03:23.634 --> 00:03:25.155]  That's coming up.
[00:03:25.155 --> 00:03:26.756]  Simply amazing.
[00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:33.061]  How the globalists destabilize the third world, then weaponize it against the West, then bring it in, en masse, to be controlled by the left. 85%!
[00:03:34.562 --> 00:03:35.363]  I was saying 80%.
[00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:38.966]  Paul Watson corrected me yesterday and sent me the news article.
[00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:45.092]  85% of quote migrants, that's invaders, in Europe the last five years are still on welfare.
[00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:47.114]  They're not working.
[00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:48.335]  It's killing the tourism.
[00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:49.175]  It's killing everything.
[00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:52.819]  It's like tourism's dying in San Francisco because of all this.
[00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.761]  But they can't stop, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.903]  Meanwhile, California has eight of the ten most polluted U.S.
[00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:58.204]  cities.
[00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.932]  Then expanding on that with the latest on Michael Cohen.
[00:04:02.932 --> 00:04:04.192]  It's Michael F. Cohen.
[00:04:04.192 --> 00:04:05.553]  Who knows what he's done?
[00:04:05.553 --> 00:04:10.455]  Trump camp fears attorney could flip on the president and reveal his worst secrets.
[00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:11.816]  His bigger threat than Mueller.
[00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:14.157]  Yeah, because there was no Russiagate.
[00:04:14.157 --> 00:04:17.799]  But Mueller's the one that dug up whatever's there on this.
[00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.740]  Paying off women.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.861]  Whippedy flippin' do.
[00:04:22.023 --> 00:04:32.794]  And now you see it's going off Russiagate seamlessly, all the comedy shows, all the so-called news shows, to what people have done with their wee-wees.
[00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.191]  Meanwhile, the Clintons and the pedophile aircraft, that's all off limits.
[00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:39.912]  And Alex Jones is now public enemy number one.
[00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:43.554]  The number one news story, Yahoo News, BBC, CNN.
[00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:48.797]  Alex Jones and a new Sandy Hook hoax that I haven't been saying for years.
[00:04:48.797 --> 00:04:59.242]  I think the kids died and that I've been sued for saying the kids didn't die and crisis actors, but they never even show where I said that in the news articles, hoaxing everyone to sell that idea on the public.
[00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:07.711]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:22.094 --> 00:06:27.296]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:34.398]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday, the 18th day of April 2018.
[00:06:34.398 --> 00:06:37.659]  We will be live here for the next four hours.
[00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:41.020]  Then Owen Schroer, Roger Stone in the War Room is coming up after that.
[00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:50.513]  I gotta tell you, I am extremely honored to be under massive globalist attack, because I know that we've been damaging their authoritarian world government.
[00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:58.798]  I've been exposing their murderous criminal wars, their alliance with radical Islam, their alliance with narco-terrorist organizations.
[00:06:58.798 --> 00:07:03.220]  We have been causing massive awakenings all over the world, from the UK,
[00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:09.027]  To Eastern Europe, from Brazil to areas of Africa.
[00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:23.844]  And InfoWars has been credited, our guests, our listeners, my crew, this whole operation, by the globalists in major white papers and major congressional hearings with the CIA and the Defense Department and the Democratic Party.
[00:07:24.758 --> 00:07:30.302]  We have been credited with the nationalist populist revolutions worldwide.
[00:07:30.302 --> 00:07:36.086]  We are seen as a central core pillar of the global awakening.
[00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:40.750]  And so because of that, we're going through massive continued PSYOPs.
[00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:52.078]  And I'm going to explain, coming up at the bottom of the hour, why we're going through those PSYOPs and why they're trying to set the precedent to shut us down to then shut everyone else down.
[00:07:53.444 --> 00:07:56.287]  That is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:56.287 --> 00:08:18.086]  AP is the only publication out of dozens I looked at, hundreds of headlines I looked at, there's 30 plus thousand articles out right now since yesterday, saying Alex Jones says no one died at Sandy Hook, Alex Jones says, you know, he, the parents are liars, all these other incredible lies, and then never quoting what I've really said.
[00:08:18.906 --> 00:08:37.955]  There's a few little short clips where I played devil's advocate years ago saying could have completely happened like they say could have been a hoax because governments have been caught lying before but we investigated it for about four years I've been saying I believe children died there but they still reboot it believing it's something that hurts me and then they throw it out there
[00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:51.689]  But if you actually read the lawsuit against us, it's for saying that the parents are out there, part of anti-gun control groups, that are putting out anti-gun control talking points, and that
[00:08:52.967 --> 00:09:09.847]  We have a right to then criticize people that are pushing for the abolition of the Second Amendment, just like they said that I said David Hogg was a 24-year-old crisis actor, and just like they've been saying in the media for the last month that I said that no one died at Parkland.
[00:09:09.847 --> 00:09:10.929]  Nowhere did we say that.
[00:09:13.117 --> 00:09:27.809]  They then source on ABC News, CBS, NBC, CNN, a clip of Owen Schroyer that was taken down by YouTube and put back up, and it got 14 million views once we put it back up, where Owen said, we're not saying they're crisis actors.
[00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:30.371]  We're not saying they're 24.
[00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:31.833]  We're not saying the shooting didn't happen.
[00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:38.198]  We're saying they picked four students out of 3,000 to give scripted anti-gun messages, and they're funded by the Democrats and George Soros.
[00:09:38.198 --> 00:09:40.340]  That's all completely admitted fact!
[00:09:42.378 --> 00:09:57.026]  I expect they'll sue me after this hype in a few months, saying no students died, and all of it, it'll be a frivolous suit, it'll be thrown out, it's not true, but they'll run the headline everywhere as well.
[00:09:57.026 --> 00:10:01.428]  And the media's trying to get somebody to kill me.
[00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:03.549]  That's what they're doing.
[00:10:03.549 --> 00:10:08.312]  All of our affiliates heard us on Valentine's Day and the day after, have students on,
[00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:12.906]  Who said that there were multiple shooters.
[00:10:12.906 --> 00:10:13.666]  We don't know if that's true or not.
[00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:14.567]  That's what the witnesses said.
[00:10:14.567 --> 00:10:15.907]  Local news as well.
[00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.548]  And that the police stood down.
[00:10:17.548 --> 00:10:25.913]  Well, it came out that the police did stand down.
[00:10:25.913 --> 00:10:27.734]  So, you can go to Infowars.com.
[00:10:27.734 --> 00:10:28.174]  Scroll back.
[00:10:28.174 --> 00:10:30.675]  I'll give radio listeners the title of the article.
[00:10:30.675 --> 00:10:33.597]  You can watch the banned videos.
[00:10:33.597 --> 00:10:35.998]  Then you can watch the news' response lying about them.
[00:10:35.998 --> 00:10:36.358]  Watch!
[00:10:36.358 --> 00:10:39.980]  These Infowars videos were banned by YouTube.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.761]  Infowars.com.
[00:10:44.138 --> 00:10:48.221]  We were able to repost them, show you what we really said they had to back down.
[00:10:48.221 --> 00:10:59.330]  14 million people watched the two videos of us saying, we are not saying they're crisis actors, we're saying they've been picked because they're anti-gun and they're having staged town halls.
[00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.513]  And it came out they were giving the kids the questions to ask and it was all scripted.
[00:11:03.513 --> 00:11:09.939]  The response, the jumping on the bandwagon, using the crisis to blame gun owners and demonize the Second Amendment.
[00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:11.520]  They don't want me pointing that out.
[00:11:12.915 --> 00:11:24.219]  So they misrepresent and then they edit videos together, you've seen them do it, where I said, I'm not against gays, but they say I'm against gays.
[00:11:24.219 --> 00:11:31.121]  And Colbert on CBS and Comedy Central on Viacom, same group, most vicious.
[00:11:31.121 --> 00:11:34.782]  You can go watch the, where they show me going, I don't like gays.
[00:11:36.065 --> 00:11:38.907]  Well, it's not my fault that they edit what I do.
[00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.768]  It's their fault that they edit it.
[00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:47.252]  Everybody knows they do it, and that's why they're falling apart.
[00:11:47.252 --> 00:12:02.040]  What I've said about Sandy Hook is if they caught them lying about babies out of incubators that launched a war that killed millions of people in Iraq, and we've got caught government media fixing polls and lying and staging stuff, I don't blame people that see stuff on mainstream news and don't believe a word of it.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.842]  I can see how they believe it's all actors and it's all fake.
[00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:07.052]  That's the clip they take out.
[00:12:07.052 --> 00:12:09.115]  But we've investigated it.
[00:12:09.115 --> 00:12:10.518]  Real school shootings happened.
[00:12:10.518 --> 00:12:12.020]  I don't think the globalists are that bold.
[00:12:14.073 --> 00:12:16.195]  But you're allowed to question things in America.
[00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:17.916]  That's not defamation.
[00:12:17.916 --> 00:12:31.086]  But what is defamation is to file lawsuits that say I said things I didn't say and then put me and my whole family through the wringer and lie about us and hold us up against dead children and say basically we hate their families, we hate the children.
[00:12:31.086 --> 00:12:32.868]  It's almost like I murdered the children.
[00:12:32.868 --> 00:12:33.848]  And that's not what happened.
[00:12:33.848 --> 00:12:38.692]  And our listeners know the truth and we're receiving record traffic at NewsWars.com.
[00:12:39.813 --> 00:12:46.595]  PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com because people want to find out what is this all about.
[00:12:46.595 --> 00:12:50.016]  Just like calling Trump a racist.
[00:12:50.016 --> 00:12:50.716]  Well, there's no evidence.
[00:12:50.716 --> 00:12:54.137]  Just like calling all his supporters Nazis.
[00:12:54.137 --> 00:12:59.038]  Just like USA Today with a headline a few days ago that all of Trump's supporters are racist and immoral.
[00:12:59.038 --> 00:13:03.159]  That's defamation against the American people, but they're doing it.
[00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:04.760]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.120]  The New York Times saying, hey, they don't have any security over here.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.281]  They're playing baseball.
[00:13:08.281 --> 00:13:09.381]  Somebody ought to go give them a visit.
[00:13:10.384 --> 00:13:16.307]  Wolf Blitzer having guests on saying the guy that shot Scalise was a hero.
[00:13:16.307 --> 00:13:27.293]  All of their bullying, all of their attacks, and then they want to frame those of us questioning all this, and those of us standing up against globalism, and open borders, and the big mega banks, and all this unelected TPP.
[00:13:31.798 --> 00:13:38.643]  They want to be able to bully us and silence us, and they're going authoritarian, and that's what this is.
[00:13:38.643 --> 00:13:44.266]  And because we've been so effective, because you've supported us, and you've spread the word, they're coming after us.
[00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:50.230]  But our affiliates, and our listeners, and our sponsors, the ones they haven't taken, know the truth.
[00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:55.916]  It is dizzying the amount of TV networks and systems that are calling us and turning us on.
[00:13:55.916 --> 00:14:01.644]  I don't even want to celebrate some of this, because I know they'll try to go harass them, but these networks and stations already know that.
[00:14:01.644 --> 00:14:03.427]  And we've broken through here.
[00:14:03.427 --> 00:14:04.448]  They've jumped the shark.
[00:14:04.448 --> 00:14:06.091]  This has really, really backfired.
[00:14:06.783 --> 00:14:10.325]  But then I started realizing last night, this morning, they don't care.
[00:14:10.325 --> 00:14:34.137]  They're going for broke on every front, like having Hillary's favorite judge, that they wanted to be her Attorney General, and Clinton's Attorney General, who married George Soros and his wife, his third wife, two years ago, and allowed the raid on his private lawyer, unrelated from Russiagate, and now gave it all to leak to the media, on record, ordered it put in a federal database, where all the federal FBI people can get it, not just the investigators.
[00:14:34.137 --> 00:14:34.677]  That's never done.
[00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:39.382]  Most people that are on that case get it, not the entire Bureau.
[00:14:39.382 --> 00:14:42.903]  Namely because if there's corrupt FBI agents in there, you don't want them to tip people off.
[00:14:42.903 --> 00:14:46.104]  That's the so-called reason.
[00:14:46.104 --> 00:14:48.385]  So you cannot make this up.
[00:14:48.385 --> 00:14:54.966]  And I'm honored to have that old evil Nazi collaborator Soros backing a lot of these lawsuits and financing them on record.
[00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:56.547]  That'll all come out in discovery.
[00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:59.028]  But most of these will be thrown out on summary judgment.
[00:14:59.028 --> 00:15:02.069]  And that's just their tactic is to put out these fake deals and drive me to the mud.
[00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:03.129]  And I've already kind of covered it.
[00:15:04.582 --> 00:15:09.365]  The original Sandy Hook, we looked at it, because there's been other hoaxes, and I don't think the thing was a hoax.
[00:15:09.365 --> 00:15:19.030]  The media jumped on it, they exacerbated it, they faked some locations, they did some things in the aftermath that CNN's famous for.
[00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:26.375]  But the new hoax is official, saying that I'm currently saying they're all crisis actors and it didn't happen.
[00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:30.897]  When I never called them crisis actors, my listeners said a lot of them look like they're acting.
[00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:33.459]  We looked at it, and I said, I can't say that.
[00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:37.220]  That's what I've always said, and they know that.
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:45.803]  So they just put out the headline, Jones says they're all actors, Jones says it's all fake, doesn't even say all the years, all the hundreds of times I've said that I think it was real.
[00:15:45.803 --> 00:15:48.004]  No one quotes that but AP.
[00:15:48.004 --> 00:15:56.786]  AP still has some fraction of real journalism, I guess, because AP got it right and said Jones says he believes Sandy Cook happened and has been saying it for years.
[00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:58.187]  But all the others, they're fake media.
[00:15:59.266 --> 00:16:01.147]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:16:01.147 --> 00:16:04.369]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:16:04.369 --> 00:16:05.970]  Savory and delicious.
[00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.812]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:16:08.812 --> 00:16:09.473]  Awesome.
[00:16:09.473 --> 00:16:12.555]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:14.136]  NASA PAC Technology.
[00:16:14.136 --> 00:16:14.756]  Bacon.
[00:16:14.756 --> 00:16:18.899]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:20.339]  Or warm and served.
[00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:22.381]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:24.342]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[00:16:24.342 --> 00:16:27.104]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.

[00:16:29.372 --> 00:16:31.253]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:08.056]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:17:08.056 --> 00:17:16.399]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:09.366]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:09.366 --> 00:18:17.772]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.772 --> 00:18:22.655]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:22.655 --> 00:18:29.040]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:36.607]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:36.607 --> 00:18:38.509]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:18:38.509 --> 00:18:43.634]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:43.634 --> 00:18:47.978]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:18:48.158 --> 00:18:49.921]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:50.081]  Go ahead.
[00:19:03.306 --> 00:19:05.227]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:15.732]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:19:15.732 --> 00:19:19.074]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:19:19.574 --> 00:19:19.894]  Absolutely.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:20:03.277]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:20:03.277 --> 00:20:05.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.684 --> 00:20:28.766]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:28.766 --> 00:20:35.887]  So, let me just break down some of the big stories we're going to be covering, some of the incredible news we're going to be breaking down.
[00:20:35.887 --> 00:20:47.349]  Millie Weaver last night went into one of these big feminist conferences with the founder of the Me Too movement, and she brought up Bill Clinton and his history of sexual assaults, Hillary covering up for it very politely.
[00:20:47.349 --> 00:20:49.410]  She was viciously and hatefully thrown out.
[00:20:50.866 --> 00:20:59.030]  She was demonized and then she was attacked on the street by so-called feminists because you do not talk about their leftist gods.
[00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:04.292]  We're gonna be posting that video to Infowars.com before she comes on.
[00:21:04.292 --> 00:21:07.034]  We're gonna have a little article about it and a blurb.
[00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:17.258]  She'll be joining us coming up later in the broadcast at 1230 central in about an hour and 10 minutes.
[00:21:17.258 --> 00:21:18.499]  Now, that's coming up.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:26.085]  We then have Zach inside one of the highest levels of national security.
[00:21:26.085 --> 00:21:28.527]  Great source, confirmed source.
[00:21:28.527 --> 00:21:41.676]  He said on Friday night there's a fight inside the White House, there's a push by the Super Hawks against the regular Hawks for a larger war with Russia, more strikes and sanctions, and the war drums are beating hard.
[00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:47.060]  He then had to leave CENTCOM in Florida and has gone out to the West Coast.
[00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:50.993]  He will be joining us today in the third hour.
[00:21:50.993 --> 00:21:51.954]  You do not want to miss that.
[00:21:51.954 --> 00:21:54.716]  And you can speculate all day whether QAnon's real or not.
[00:21:54.716 --> 00:21:57.217]  Zach's the real deal and a great source.
[00:21:57.217 --> 00:22:03.362]  He's got big news on the internal fights inside the White House with Nikki Haley and people saying, well, no, we're not doing sanctions.
[00:22:03.362 --> 00:22:04.623]  She goes, yes, we are.
[00:22:04.623 --> 00:22:05.664]  I don't get confused.
[00:22:05.664 --> 00:22:07.165]  I'm in command.
[00:22:07.165 --> 00:22:10.447]  Remember, she was the Never Trumper.
[00:22:10.447 --> 00:22:16.071]  She led the Never Trump movement and launched Zuckerberg's Open Borders group.
[00:22:16.071 --> 00:22:17.172]  She's a globalist.
[00:22:18.188 --> 00:22:24.816]  And she wants to devastate Eastern European borders for the Muslim invasion.
[00:22:26.892 --> 00:22:32.438]  That Macron and the head of the EU immigration program say will turn Europe into North Africa.
[00:22:32.438 --> 00:22:33.779]  That's their quote.
[00:22:33.779 --> 00:22:48.975]  Europe faces unprecedented mass migration, shares destiny with Africa, 15 million African migrants are already there, 20 million more within 30 years, and that's the current number they're bringing in every year, is about 2 million Middle Easterners, 2 million
[00:22:51.568 --> 00:22:55.309]  North Africans, they want to increase that five-fold a year.
[00:22:55.309 --> 00:22:57.009]  Just total devastation.
[00:22:57.009 --> 00:23:02.531]  This is the economic warfare of the globalists who are tax-exempt offshore and will use this to devastate.
[00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:06.952]  EU Parliament member calls for banning political parties that criticize immigration.
[00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:12.253]  Swedish student reported to security services for spreading facts about immigration.
[00:23:12.253 --> 00:23:14.214]  That is just the news every day.
[00:23:14.214 --> 00:23:19.315]  UKIP leader blasts UN agenda to flood West with never-ending millions of migrants.
[00:23:20.851 --> 00:23:24.653]  Gerard Batten rips your Africa plan to EU Parliament.
[00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:25.893]  In fact, get me that video crew.
[00:23:25.893 --> 00:23:26.614]  There's so many videos.
[00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:27.814]  I want to play that crew.
[00:23:27.814 --> 00:23:29.255]  This is happening.
[00:23:29.255 --> 00:23:30.856]  This is unbelievable.
[00:23:30.856 --> 00:23:34.877]  Imagine putting 200 million Europeans in North Africa.
[00:23:34.877 --> 00:23:40.640]  But I guess we're looking for the mythical super city of Wakanda.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.741]  And the vibranium, I think you're going to find it in Europe.
[00:23:43.874 --> 00:23:49.656]  And again, the globalists have gone and exploited Africa, controlled it, dominated, destroyed Libya that was stabilizing Africa.
[00:23:49.656 --> 00:23:51.296]  Africa could be a great place.
[00:23:51.296 --> 00:23:55.798]  And the very same globalists that have exploited Africa are now exploiting Europe and everything else.
[00:23:55.798 --> 00:23:59.859]  It's reverse colonialism by the offshore globalists that are tax-exempt.
[00:23:59.859 --> 00:24:01.520]  We understand that factor, we lose.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.380]  And here's the deal.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:07.922]  Why is Macron, and the head of the EU program, I'm going to read this whole article coming up, why are they being so honest?
[00:24:09.502 --> 00:24:15.125]  Because in Poland and in Hungary and in the Czech Republic and all over, people are getting elected that understand this, that people get it.
[00:24:15.125 --> 00:24:20.368]  So instead of the EU denying its plan when it's in their own documents, they're going, yeah, what's the big deal?
[00:24:20.368 --> 00:24:23.730]  They're hiding it in plain view.
[00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:32.234]  And they talk about Eastern Europe is going to revolt and will have to be militarily occupied for the genocide culturally to be carried out.
[00:24:32.234 --> 00:24:37.357]  This is all being just openly stated, kind of like banning free speech in Europe, banning free speech here.
[00:24:38.607 --> 00:24:48.232]  And Infowars is being used as a case point to misrepresent what we've said, try to make it illegal to question public events, big mass casualty events, like Vegas!
[00:24:48.232 --> 00:25:00.758]  We were told the guy was an Islamist gun dealer, he'd been to the Middle East a bunch, he was there days before, there was a stand down, it was really the Saudis in town, part of a Saudi civil war, for a Saudi military convention, with the Crown Prince there and his enemy, the other Crown Prince.
[00:25:02.523 --> 00:25:05.944]  And months later that all came out and they still won't say officially what happened.
[00:25:05.944 --> 00:25:10.866]  They don't want us on air to have those guests on.
[00:25:10.866 --> 00:25:11.946]  Like Zach!
[00:25:11.946 --> 00:25:18.908]  And Zach's information dovetailed with the FBI hostage rescue team.
[00:25:18.908 --> 00:25:21.669]  I got that directly from the hostage rescue team.
[00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:24.390]  And the government knows that and they're angry.
[00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.930]  The criminal elements of it.
[00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.031]  The good government elements told us that.
[00:25:30.299 --> 00:25:33.300]  Understand, the Google contract came out last year.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.962]  Google takes out major contracts at ELS Info Wars.
[00:25:35.962 --> 00:25:37.422]  Ron Paul's mentioned as well.
[00:25:37.422 --> 00:25:39.123]  They don't mess with their algorithm.
[00:25:39.123 --> 00:25:39.983]  Now I can tell it's broken.
[00:25:39.983 --> 00:25:40.584]  They have done that.
[00:25:40.584 --> 00:25:41.344]  They screwed the whole thing up.
[00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:44.931]  Nothing works anymore, it's all a big fraud.
[00:25:44.931 --> 00:25:48.374]  But, they hired and paid millions of dollars for that firm to delist us.
[00:25:48.374 --> 00:25:52.698]  They said because we were saying that the chemical attacks were staged and false flags.
[00:25:52.698 --> 00:25:54.580]  And let's go to that next.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.383]  The articles on Infowars.com.
[00:25:57.383 --> 00:26:01.486]  Again, it's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:26:01.486 --> 00:26:07.271]  We have Senator Rand Paul coming out last night on Fox News.
[00:26:08.413 --> 00:26:10.314]  And saying, basically, it's a false flag.
[00:26:10.314 --> 00:26:12.555]  There's no way Assad would actually do this.
[00:26:12.555 --> 00:26:15.236]  The rebels have been caught doing it before.
[00:26:15.236 --> 00:26:17.237]  Again, the story is on Infowars.com.
[00:26:17.237 --> 00:26:19.518]  That's a separate one today that we've got on screen.
[00:26:19.518 --> 00:26:20.919]  Rand Paul warns new U.S.
[00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:24.460]  war powers will rubber stamp for global conflict.
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.921]  We're going to get to that coming up.
[00:26:25.921 --> 00:26:30.363]  The other article is from last night on Infowars.com.
[00:26:30.363 --> 00:26:35.365]  Rand Paul says Syrian gas attack, probably a false flag.
[00:26:35.365 --> 00:26:36.606]  But let's go ahead and go to that video.
[00:26:36.606 --> 00:26:36.906]  Here it is.
[00:26:37.879 --> 00:26:45.425]  In fact, for that matter, I still look at the attack and say, you know, Assad either must be the dumbest dictator on the planet or maybe he didn't do it.
[00:26:45.425 --> 00:26:47.927]  I have yet to see evidence that he did do it.
[00:26:47.927 --> 00:26:50.790]  The intelligence agencies claim they have that evidence.
[00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.450]  But think about it.
[00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.391]  Does it make any sense?
[00:26:52.391 --> 00:26:55.634]  He's been winning the war for the last couple of years.
[00:26:55.634 --> 00:27:00.678]  The only thing that would galvanize the world to attack Assad directly is a chemical attack.
[00:27:01.358 --> 00:27:08.962]  It killed relatively few people compared to what can be killed with traditional bombs, traditional machine guns, traditional tanks.
[00:27:08.962 --> 00:27:14.705]  And so you wonder, really, what logic would there be for Assad to be using chemical weapons?
[00:27:14.705 --> 00:27:22.270]  Why would you target 50-something civilians that have no military value, knowing it's the one thing that'll get you destroyed, right as you've won and the U.S.
[00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.950]  and Russia are pulling out?
[00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.811]  Riddle me that, Batman.
[00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:26.472]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:27:27.568 --> 00:27:39.875]  We're going to come back and drill into more of the demonization of European culture and whites by mainstream media and then a really hilarious super on target man that I want to get on the show.
[00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:45.479]  Black guy walks into Starbucks, says racist, immediately gets free coffee, white guilt gone wild.
[00:27:45.479 --> 00:27:47.520]  I'm going to do this myself and see what happens.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.803]  And it's going to be racist if they don't give me my coffee because I'm opposing racism myself.
[00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:53.904]  I deserve some free coffee as well.
[00:27:53.904 --> 00:27:57.166]  In fact, I think this guy deserves a free Starbucks shop.
[00:27:58.902 --> 00:28:11.252]  You know, the funny thing about what's happening in Europe is they're saying bring 200 million Africans to Europe, but then in South Africa they're killing the farmers saying get out, but then telling Australia don't let the white farmers escape.
[00:28:11.252 --> 00:28:22.722]  But that's the racist communist leaders of South Africa, not your average African or this fella who's an American who really knows how to expose and troll the ridiculous reverse racism against white people, so God bless him.
[00:28:22.722 --> 00:28:23.782]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:28:23.782 --> 00:28:27.505]  Briefly, I've got good news and I've got bad news.
[00:28:28.266 --> 00:28:36.608]  And the good news is we are going to get a rush shipment of X2 in from the manufacturer with the pure deep earth crystals, but they are running out.
[00:28:36.608 --> 00:28:40.829]  I told you a run or more after this and then it probably the end of it could be the end of it.
[00:28:40.829 --> 00:28:42.009]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:43.490]  They've got an emergency run going.
[00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:49.571]  So I'm able to put it back up for sale at 25% off for those of you that want to get your hands on it.
[00:28:49.571 --> 00:28:51.712]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[00:28:51.712 --> 00:28:53.312]  Super Mel Vitality is also 50% off right now.
[00:28:59.716 --> 00:29:00.917]  Hear that?
[00:29:00.917 --> 00:29:06.321]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:29:06.321 --> 00:29:09.203]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:29:09.203 --> 00:29:12.785]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:29:12.785 --> 00:29:20.370]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[00:29:27.395 --> 00:29:28.556]  Faketv.com
[00:29:29.392 --> 00:29:30.893]  You have been lied to.
[00:29:30.893 --> 00:29:33.355]  My name is Kevin Shipp.
[00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:36.056]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:29:36.056 --> 00:29:41.379]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:47.063]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:29:47.063 --> 00:29:50.505]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[00:29:50.505 --> 00:29:53.627]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[00:30:00.239 --> 00:30:11.706]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[00:30:11.706 --> 00:30:20.631]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a
[00:30:20.851 --> 00:30:29.577]  Powerful, 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[00:30:29.577 --> 00:30:34.600]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:44.887]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[00:30:44.887 --> 00:30:50.271]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[00:30:50.751 --> 00:31:00.178]  When you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our Republic and freedom worldwide.
[00:31:00.178 --> 00:31:10.625]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:31:10.765 --> 00:31:12.826]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:31:12.826 --> 00:31:15.688]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:31:15.688 --> 00:31:17.169]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.169 --> 00:31:24.014]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:31:24.014 --> 00:31:25.234]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:31:26.135 --> 00:31:35.782]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:31:35.782 --> 00:31:52.614]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:31:52.614 --> 00:31:55.776]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:31:55.916 --> 00:32:00.203]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:00.203 --> 00:32:02.546]  Infowarslife is launching its newest product.
[00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:04.710]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.534]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:20.113]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[00:32:20.113 --> 00:32:29.216]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[00:32:29.716 --> 00:32:35.501]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:40.946]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[00:32:40.946 --> 00:32:43.209]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[00:32:43.209 --> 00:32:45.230]  Bought these, sold out in a month.
[00:32:46.495 --> 00:32:49.498]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[00:32:49.498 --> 00:32:51.539]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:32:51.539 --> 00:32:54.842]  We sold it at 50% off, till it sold out.
[00:32:54.842 --> 00:32:57.384]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[00:32:57.384 --> 00:33:03.368]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[00:33:03.368 --> 00:33:06.030]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.135 --> 00:33:27.517]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:27.517 --> 00:33:33.620]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.201]  We are back live.
[00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:50.768]  Coming up at the end of the hour in the next segment, I'm going to go over the AP actually being somewhat honest about what I've really said about Sandy Hook versus the rest of the media.
[00:33:51.792 --> 00:33:57.037]  It's not that I'm running away from saying I think it was a hoax if it was a hoax.
[00:33:57.037 --> 00:34:00.180]  For four years I've said I think people really died there.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.142]  And they know that.
[00:34:02.142 --> 00:34:10.470]  The suit by the media, by the Democrats, using the poor parents, is meant to just demonize yours truly, building up to something big.
[00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:16.816]  They physically, I can guarantee you, want to assassinate my character ahead of shutting me up, putting me in prison.
[00:34:18.433 --> 00:34:19.214]  Or having me killed.
[00:34:19.214 --> 00:34:23.678]  If you don't think the globalists don't kill people all day, they've hijacked America.
[00:34:23.678 --> 00:34:24.819]  They killed President Kennedy.
[00:34:24.819 --> 00:34:26.341]  They're trying to kill President Trump.
[00:34:26.341 --> 00:34:28.543]  They're trying to stop this country being restored.
[00:34:28.543 --> 00:34:31.486]  And they're using a lot of people to demonize their opposition in the wake of it.
[00:34:32.475 --> 00:34:34.637]  And so a lot of people are asking me how I'm doing.
[00:34:34.637 --> 00:34:35.979]  I am doing great.
[00:34:35.979 --> 00:34:37.120]  Thanks to you.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:43.307]  We have record all-time highest traffic to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com right now.
[00:34:43.307 --> 00:34:50.655]  And yes, it takes a lot to fight these lawsuits, but I'm not selling a wide-body $50 million jet like Glenn Beck is.
[00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.257]  I fly a lot of the time in coach.
[00:34:55.609 --> 00:35:02.515]  When it's some long trip or something, I'm not spending six, seven thousand dollars to fly first class to places like Europe.
[00:35:02.515 --> 00:35:04.076]  I'm in coach, baby.
[00:35:04.076 --> 00:35:10.321]  Now, sure, I could pay and be in first class, but then I wouldn't have the money to build this operation.
[00:35:10.321 --> 00:35:12.783]  I wouldn't have the money to fight the globalist attacks.
[00:35:12.783 --> 00:35:15.285]  I am a war machine against the globalist.
[00:35:15.285 --> 00:35:16.926]  I am here committed to go all the way to the end.
[00:35:16.926 --> 00:35:17.647]  I want to make that clear.
[00:35:19.124 --> 00:35:22.465]  Don't let them make you think I'm losing by all these attacks.
[00:35:22.465 --> 00:35:25.245]  We're winning and they know it and they're pissed.
[00:35:25.245 --> 00:35:26.805]  Believe me, they've got us under surveillance.
[00:35:26.805 --> 00:35:28.286]  Criminal elements of the deep state.
[00:35:28.286 --> 00:35:31.846]  They know we've got all these huge TV deals going through.
[00:35:31.846 --> 00:35:33.947]  They know a bunch of big ones already went through.
[00:35:33.947 --> 00:35:44.468]  They know instead of getting one station a month and then losing a station a month or something like that, we're getting 20, 30, 40 radio stations a month and dozens of TV stations a month and then only losing a few.
[00:35:44.468 --> 00:35:46.649]  They're crapping their britches.
[00:35:46.649 --> 00:35:47.069]  We have
[00:35:48.343 --> 00:35:50.083]  Revolutionize the awakening.
[00:35:50.083 --> 00:35:51.124]  America gets it.
[00:35:51.124 --> 00:35:54.845]  They go, that's the guy that talked about human animal clones that gets attacked.
[00:35:54.845 --> 00:35:55.065]  Why?
[00:35:55.065 --> 00:35:57.785]  It's admitted in the news that the frogs are turning gay.
[00:35:57.785 --> 00:35:59.406]  He said that, you know, years ago.
[00:35:59.406 --> 00:36:07.627]  Well, wait, he's the guy that talked about world government and plans to implode the borders of Europe and the US and bring in all the third world and all the rest.
[00:36:07.627 --> 00:36:09.268]  That's all over the news now.
[00:36:09.268 --> 00:36:10.448]  But they're saying it's a good thing.
[00:36:10.448 --> 00:36:13.189]  Well, Alex Jones, he told us this a decade ago, 20 years ago.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:25.982]  Because like I told you, high-level Pentagon sources said Kim Jong-un had already agreed to denuclearization if they can have a peace deal with the South and a talk of a 10-year reunification.
[00:36:25.982 --> 00:36:33.823]  Word for word, a month later, they had already agreed in high-level talks in North Korea with the U.S.
[00:36:33.823 --> 00:36:38.024]  and South Korea in a framework, and now you hear they've already agreed.
[00:36:38.024 --> 00:36:39.304]  And the neocons don't know what to do.
[00:36:39.304 --> 00:36:44.085]  They're beside themselves because they wanted the crisis to keep going forever, and Trump wants to end the crisis.
[00:36:44.872 --> 00:36:49.235]  And they're going to give North Korea an offer they can't refuse after putting them under pressure.
[00:36:49.235 --> 00:36:50.435]  They are upset.
[00:36:50.435 --> 00:36:52.597]  That's why they say Trump's incompetent.
[00:36:52.597 --> 00:36:53.977]  That's why they've got Comey on TV.
[00:36:55.034 --> 00:36:58.795]  Dressed like a weirdo gangster in a black shirt and like a gray jacket.
[00:36:58.795 --> 00:37:00.456]  Talking about how Trump's immoral.
[00:37:00.456 --> 00:37:16.242]  Comey covered up for all the child molesting, and Epstein, and Weiner, and all of the trafficking, and all the Aleister Crowley stuff, and all the Russian payoffs, and Chinese payoffs, and the criminal servers, and the foundation.
[00:37:17.282 --> 00:37:18.463]  When is America going to learn?
[00:37:18.463 --> 00:37:24.107]  When somebody acts like they're Mr. Goody Two-Shoes and acts all sanctimonious, you better believe you scratch their skin.
[00:37:24.107 --> 00:37:26.408]  They're an evil, wicked devil.
[00:37:26.408 --> 00:37:35.794]  There's an old English saying, I forget who said it, but when somebody keeps telling you about their honor and how morally perfect they are, you better start hiding your spoons.
[00:37:35.794 --> 00:37:43.900]  Back then, you know, spoons were made out of silver and a spoon would be worth the equivalent of like $500,000 today in British pounds.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.560]  Worth a lot of money.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.741]  It's easy to steal.
[00:37:45.741 --> 00:37:46.782]  Hide your spoons.
[00:37:48.083 --> 00:37:50.664]  I mean, he just radiates I'm a criminal.
[00:37:50.664 --> 00:37:52.784]  He radiates I'm disingenuous.
[00:37:52.784 --> 00:37:55.405]  He radiates I'm a pervert.
[00:37:55.405 --> 00:37:57.785]  In my view, Comey looks like a child molester.
[00:37:57.785 --> 00:37:59.386]  Okay?
[00:37:59.386 --> 00:38:00.006]  Go ahead and sue me.
[00:38:00.006 --> 00:38:01.546]  I didn't say you're a child molester.
[00:38:01.546 --> 00:38:04.207]  I said you look like a child molester to me.
[00:38:04.207 --> 00:38:07.027]  I wouldn't let you near my kids.
[00:38:07.027 --> 00:38:10.808]  Now, you say Trump, you don't know, maybe Trump gets pissed on by women.
[00:38:10.808 --> 00:38:12.829]  There's no proof, but you said maybe he does.
[00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:13.989]  So, Comey?
[00:38:15.532 --> 00:38:19.334]  Maybe you have sex with little kids.
[00:38:19.334 --> 00:38:20.334]  I'm not saying you do.
[00:38:20.334 --> 00:38:21.354]  It's not defamation.
[00:38:21.354 --> 00:38:22.555]  I'm saying maybe you do.
[00:38:22.555 --> 00:38:25.916]  Maybe you're a Martian from Pluto.
[00:38:25.916 --> 00:38:28.197]  The media wants to take the gloves off?
[00:38:28.197 --> 00:38:28.678]  Let's do it.
[00:38:28.678 --> 00:38:30.458]  Let's get in the arena, Jack.
[00:38:30.458 --> 00:38:32.399]  I'm here to ram heads with you.
[00:38:32.399 --> 00:38:34.740]  I'm here to take you down.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.921]  Liberty or death.
[00:38:37.921 --> 00:38:39.062]  Victory or death.
[00:38:39.062 --> 00:38:41.323]  No surrender.
[00:38:41.323 --> 00:38:41.703]  I get it.
[00:38:41.703 --> 00:38:43.624]  You guys come from a bunch of cowardly scum.
[00:38:43.624 --> 00:38:43.904]  I don't.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.023]  To me it's not even courage, it's my genetics.
[00:38:50.023 --> 00:38:51.665]  Victory or death.
[00:38:51.665 --> 00:38:54.066]  Victory or death.
[00:38:54.066 --> 00:38:55.708]  You understand?
[00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:56.708]  Victory or death.
[00:38:56.708 --> 00:39:01.632]  So the left is all on their ramming speed right now.
[00:39:01.632 --> 00:39:02.613]  They're going all out.
[00:39:02.613 --> 00:39:05.735]  Well good, you're finally gonna man up a little bit.
[00:39:05.735 --> 00:39:13.101]  We've stood up to you finally, your reign of terror is coming to an end, and you're finally gonna have to get out in the open and lose some skin in the game.
[00:39:14.278 --> 00:39:16.980]  I've already lost a lot of skin, Jack.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:21.384]  I'm ready to lose all my skin, and all my treasure, and the whole thing.
[00:39:21.384 --> 00:39:28.970]  Because my house, House Jones, doesn't have a future if we don't beat you.
[00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:32.673]  So my whole house is in.
[00:39:32.673 --> 00:39:35.896]  And your houses are in now too, and you know it, don't you?
[00:39:35.896 --> 00:39:41.901]  So we'll see whose houses, House Soros or House Jones, has victory at the end of this.
[00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:43.042]  Because I know how history works.
[00:39:44.466 --> 00:39:50.434]  My destruction is the seeds of your sure destruction, fools.
[00:39:50.434 --> 00:39:54.078]  See, I am the ultimate collectivist thinking about the long span of humanity.
[00:39:54.078 --> 00:39:56.241]  You have your false collectivism.
[00:39:56.241 --> 00:39:58.523]  You will fall.
[00:39:58.523 --> 00:40:02.789]  Now, globalist operatives are trying to implode Europe because it's an engine of wealth.
[00:40:04.102 --> 00:40:08.543]  Ukip leader blasts UN agenda to flood West with never-ending millions of migrants.
[00:40:08.543 --> 00:40:10.424]  Infowars.com, there's video.
[00:40:10.424 --> 00:40:12.364]  Macron and EU leaders.
[00:40:12.364 --> 00:40:15.225]  Europe faces unprecedented mass migration.
[00:40:15.225 --> 00:40:17.145]  Shares diversity with Africa.
[00:40:17.145 --> 00:40:20.106]  They said they want 200 million North Africans to be in Europe.
[00:40:20.106 --> 00:40:23.987]  That's two-thirds of the European population.
[00:40:24.963 --> 00:40:29.784]  Within 30 years, total implosion and basically forced intermarrying.
[00:40:29.784 --> 00:40:34.585]  EU Parliament member calls for banning political parties that criticize immigration.
[00:40:34.585 --> 00:40:40.126]  Swedish students reportedly to security services were spreading facts about immigration, open borders.
[00:40:40.126 --> 00:40:47.107]  Well, it's the same thing with the sensitivity training going on at Starbucks and the social engineering that killed their stock.
[00:40:47.107 --> 00:40:54.248]  And now the Starbucks CEO apologizes for the reprehensible arrest of two black men that came in, didn't buy any food or drinks, wanted to use the bathroom and just sat there.
[00:40:57.619 --> 00:40:59.200]  When we come back, I've got the clip.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:05.606]  Black guy walks into Starbucks, says racist, immediately gets free coffee.
[00:41:05.606 --> 00:41:07.007]  White guilt gone wild.
[00:41:07.007 --> 00:41:10.470]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:19.539]  And it's totally hilarious because, oh yeah, we're showing some footage here, you know, of the black guys getting arrested because they wouldn't leave.
[00:41:19.539 --> 00:41:20.760]  This is total stunts.
[00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:27.362]  Nobody's ticking you out like it was the lunch counters 50, 60 years ago that I think were terrible when that was going on.
[00:41:27.362 --> 00:41:34.647]  And it was the Republicans and it was Charlton Heston there with Martin Luther King before it was cool.
[00:41:34.647 --> 00:41:41.711]  But now these stunts of, who's that Muslim guy that was like yelling Allah Akbar and stuff on a plane and wonder why he got thrown off?
[00:41:41.711 --> 00:41:43.332]  This is a stunt?
[00:41:43.332 --> 00:41:44.393]  Or this other thing?
[00:41:44.393 --> 00:41:47.915]  So imagine you go up and you say, I want my free coffee.
[00:41:47.915 --> 00:41:50.937]  Just like the colleges teach, I want my free reparations.
[00:41:52.344 --> 00:42:04.712]  Even though, again, upwards of 80% of the people living in the United States, like 79%, came as immigrants, their ancestors, after the Civil War.
[00:42:04.712 --> 00:42:06.713]  There weren't any black slaves in Europe.
[00:42:06.713 --> 00:42:10.356]  There were white slaves, serfs, feudal chattel.
[00:42:11.516 --> 00:42:17.959]  And then only 2% or less of those that have genealogy before that had slaves.
[00:42:17.959 --> 00:42:20.040]  It was the rich people that did.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:32.787]  And they used it to leverage out the other poor white farmers who were sharecroppers and lived on somebody else's land and had to buy their food and everything from the company store that always had it jacked up where you couldn't live.
[00:42:32.787 --> 00:42:38.050]  And then most of them came on 7 and 10 year indentured servitude, which was slavery.
[00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:40.411]  You could be put in prison or executed if you tried to get away.
[00:42:43.388 --> 00:42:46.691]  Oh, but that's not taught in the news, even though it's a fact.
[00:42:46.691 --> 00:42:51.074]  Where are all the white people demanding reparations for white people that had them as slaves?
[00:42:51.074 --> 00:42:53.756]  But see, the ignorance is raining so people don't know.
[00:42:59.221 --> 00:43:03.623]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:43:03.623 --> 00:43:11.708]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:43:11.708 --> 00:43:17.011]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:19.532]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:43:19.532 --> 00:43:23.755]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:43:23.755 --> 00:43:26.196]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:43:26.883 --> 00:43:34.105]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:43:34.105 --> 00:43:42.188]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:43:42.188 --> 00:43:49.370]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:50.830]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.631]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[00:44:18.166 --> 00:44:18.947]  The revolution.

[00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:40.161]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[00:45:01.161 --> 00:45:09.725]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalist and live in a free society.
[00:45:09.725 --> 00:45:13.206]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.
[00:45:13.206 --> 00:45:22.751]  to create the strongest, most concentrated, over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[00:45:22.751 --> 00:45:29.934]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being the number one
[00:45:30.174 --> 00:45:33.757]  Best selling product at InfoWarsLife.com because it works so well.
[00:45:33.757 --> 00:45:41.983]  This is a gift you want to give yourself and then rest assured you're fighting the Info War so it's a total, absolute, sure win, no lose equation.
[00:45:41.983 --> 00:45:46.766]  Try Alpha Power exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com for yourself.
[00:45:46.766 --> 00:45:48.667]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's non-GMO.
[00:45:48.667 --> 00:45:49.548]  It's for your brain.
[00:45:49.548 --> 00:45:50.309]  It's for sports.
[00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:52.490]  It's for activities and it's made in the USA.
[00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.772]  Get your Alpha Power today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:45:55.772 --> 00:45:58.815]  Everybody needs to try Alpha Power today.
[00:45:59.713 --> 00:46:02.514]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[00:46:02.514 --> 00:46:12.978]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[00:46:12.978 --> 00:46:13.758]  Scalability.
[00:46:13.758 --> 00:46:16.219]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[00:46:16.219 --> 00:46:17.860]  Because there's a lot of product and a lot
[00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:24.482]  It's the other side of the equation.
[00:46:24.482 --> 00:46:34.286]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[00:46:34.286 --> 00:46:43.149]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[00:46:43.149 --> 00:46:49.111]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[00:46:49.551 --> 00:46:52.374]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[00:46:52.374 --> 00:47:02.765]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[00:47:02.765 --> 00:47:05.388]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:10.848 --> 00:47:11.508]  Is the U.S.
[00:47:11.508 --> 00:47:23.813]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:47:23.813 --> 00:47:24.453]  To Turkey?
[00:47:26.207 --> 00:47:27.629]  It is a big idea.
[00:47:27.629 --> 00:47:30.254]  A new world order.
[00:47:30.254 --> 00:47:34.000]  How is it that this organization is so well-funded, so organized?
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.111]  Islamic State-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically vital areas of the country.
[00:47:41.431 --> 00:47:49.779]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim Belhadj, and of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[00:47:49.779 --> 00:47:53.984]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:47:53.984 --> 00:47:58.508]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[00:47:58.508 --> 00:48:03.913]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United States.
[00:48:04.954 --> 00:48:09.916]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the U.S.
[00:48:09.916 --> 00:48:12.257]  government is negotiating with Iran.
[00:48:12.257 --> 00:48:17.938]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran.
[00:48:17.938 --> 00:48:22.220]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:29.148]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and played an important part in events now.
[00:48:29.148 --> 00:48:33.573]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package.
[00:48:33.573 --> 00:48:38.319]  We had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:40.061]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[00:48:42.413 --> 00:48:53.383]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[00:48:53.383 --> 00:48:56.286]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:48:56.286 --> 00:48:58.488]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:49:07.628 --> 00:49:09.549]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:10.710]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:21.638]  I'm going to get into the open announcement by the EU and by President Macron that they're going to bring 200 million North Africans into Europe to totally collapse the society as part of the globalist deindustrialization program.
[00:49:21.638 --> 00:49:23.499]  Incredible admissions.
[00:49:23.499 --> 00:49:24.480]  This is their own quotes.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:33.425]  And then meanwhile, whites are then all taught that they're the center of evil in the world, and are horrible, and crimes against white folks are then covered up.
[00:49:33.425 --> 00:49:39.629]  This is part of the elite, who are mainly old white people's strategy of total divide and conquer.
[00:49:39.629 --> 00:49:45.913]  But we've got a lot of people who see right through this, like this is a video up on Infowars.com, look at this fellow on.
[00:49:45.913 --> 00:49:50.655]  Black guy walks into Starbucks, says racist, immediately gets free coffee.
[00:49:50.655 --> 00:49:52.597]  The little intro video you just saw,
[00:49:53.497 --> 00:50:06.908]  Deals with the fact that the globalists are building towards destabilizing the borders of Europe by putting radical Islamic regimes in, who do horrible things to the men, women, and children of those countries, and commit incredible war crimes.
[00:50:06.908 --> 00:50:09.110]  Sell women into sex slavery, you name it.
[00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:16.416]  Then Soros ferries across on hundred-foot Zodiac boats thousands of people a day into Italy, into Greece, and other areas.
[00:50:16.416 --> 00:50:19.179]  It is the planned implosion of Europe.
[00:50:20.106 --> 00:50:21.828]  Simply incredible.
[00:50:21.828 --> 00:50:24.190]  And again, those articles are up on Infowars.com.
[00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:27.414]  But in the West, in the U.S.
[00:50:27.414 --> 00:50:40.547]  and in Europe, they then get all the big corporate CEOs to a man and woman who almost pay no taxes, who are multinational, international, diplomatic community, to further try to create white guilt and exacerbate tensions.
[00:50:41.448 --> 00:50:55.371]  And then if it happens that you have, obviously, a black activist, leftist activist come in, they won't buy anything, they want to use the bathroom, they sit there in the restaurant, you have a policy that you can't do that, what restaurant wouldn't throw you out if you just came and said, I'm going to sit here?
[00:50:55.371 --> 00:50:57.412]  No, I don't want to be seated, I just want to sit here.
[00:50:57.412 --> 00:50:59.132]  They said, what are you, do you have a flat tire or something?
[00:50:59.132 --> 00:51:00.112]  Is somebody coming to get you?
[00:51:00.112 --> 00:51:01.353]  No, I'm just going to sit here.
[00:51:01.353 --> 00:51:04.033]  Well, sorry, policy, you can't.
[00:51:04.033 --> 00:51:06.534]  You at least got to buy some coffee, you know, you got to do something to be in here.
[00:51:07.822 --> 00:51:10.945]  Somebody walks in your tire shop and says, I'm just going to sit here and drink your coffee.
[00:51:10.945 --> 00:51:12.326]  You're like, no, get out.
[00:51:12.326 --> 00:51:12.907]  No loitering.
[00:51:12.907 --> 00:51:15.169]  It's called loitering.
[00:51:15.169 --> 00:51:18.852]  And so this fella, it's up on Infowars.com.
[00:51:18.852 --> 00:51:23.516]  It's Hotep Jesus at Vibe High.
[00:51:23.516 --> 00:51:24.917]  I'm going to get him on the show.
[00:51:26.229 --> 00:51:27.870]  Goes into the Starbucks.
[00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:34.712]  The stunt was in response to the news that Starbucks is set to close 8,000 stores for an afternoon for race-based training.
[00:51:34.712 --> 00:51:41.134]  And also I have an article here that the type of race-based training they're doing, implicit association test.
[00:51:41.134 --> 00:51:46.936]  The professors that developed it said it's a fraud and doesn't work.
[00:51:46.936 --> 00:51:50.217]  So again, it's all about creating white guilt.
[00:51:50.217 --> 00:51:54.819]  And so he walks in and talks to this young woman working, going to college at the same time,
[00:51:56.104 --> 00:51:59.645]  And she says, oh, I heard about that, about the racism at Starbucks.
[00:51:59.645 --> 00:52:03.026]  Yes, here's your free coffee.
[00:52:03.026 --> 00:52:05.867]  So let's go ahead and roll that video.
[00:52:05.867 --> 00:52:09.868]  I'm about to go inside, get my free coffee.
[00:52:09.868 --> 00:52:10.788]  Y'all ready?
[00:52:10.788 --> 00:52:14.009]  Y'all ready?
[00:52:14.009 --> 00:52:15.529]  Are y'all ready?
[00:52:15.529 --> 00:52:17.930]  I'm about to get my free coffee.
[00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:18.830]  How you doing?
[00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:20.031]  Good, how are you?
[00:52:20.031 --> 00:52:24.212]  All right, I heard y'all was racist, so I came to get my own free coffee.
[00:52:24.212 --> 00:52:25.132]  I saw that.
[00:52:25.777 --> 00:52:31.239]  Yeah, I heard you guys don't like black people, so I wanted to get my Starbucks reparations voucher.
[00:52:31.239 --> 00:52:32.719]  What's that?
[00:52:32.719 --> 00:52:34.220]  Is that a real thing?
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.000]  It's a real thing.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.381]  I mean, I'll give it to you.
[00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:38.261]  Yeah, I saw that on my Twitter last night.
[00:52:38.261 --> 00:52:39.302]  I was like, what the ****?
[00:52:39.302 --> 00:52:40.782]  Yeah, I need a free coffee.
[00:52:40.782 --> 00:52:42.563]  I'll give you a free coffee.
[00:52:42.563 --> 00:52:44.003]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:52:44.003 --> 00:52:45.004]  This is justice.
[00:52:45.004 --> 00:52:46.324]  Where was I?
[00:52:46.324 --> 00:52:46.904]  Philly.
[00:52:46.904 --> 00:52:47.364]  Philly?
[00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:47.665]  What?
[00:52:47.665 --> 00:52:48.365]  Are you serious?
[00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:49.025]  Sorry.
[00:52:49.025 --> 00:52:49.685]  Okay, sorry.
[00:52:49.685 --> 00:52:54.427]  I'm going to fetch you something.
[00:52:56.331 --> 00:53:00.594]  This is justice, this is what I'm talking about.
[00:53:00.594 --> 00:53:03.436]  It's great customer service.
[00:53:03.436 --> 00:53:08.080]  Yeah, I was reading that and I was like, there is no way.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:08.560]  Absolutely.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.724]  There is no way, but let me prove I'm not bad.
[00:53:12.724 --> 00:53:13.925]  Overpriced coffee.
[00:53:13.925 --> 00:53:15.946]  Could you imagine?
[00:53:15.946 --> 00:53:18.328]  Never here.
[00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:18.888]  It is strong though.
[00:53:18.888 --> 00:53:20.169]  Does it have some milk in it?
[00:53:20.169 --> 00:53:21.250]  Sure.
[00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:22.631]  What kind?
[00:53:22.631 --> 00:53:23.512]  Uh, old.
[00:53:26.278 --> 00:53:27.339]  Yeah.
[00:53:27.339 --> 00:53:28.339]  Reparations, man.
[00:53:28.339 --> 00:53:32.122]  Gotta get my reparations for being black in America.
[00:53:32.122 --> 00:53:35.084]  Black lives matter.
[00:53:35.084 --> 00:53:37.725]  Hit pause for a second.
[00:53:37.725 --> 00:53:41.148]  Again, if America's so bad, the whole thing is, why don't you go to Africa?
[00:53:41.148 --> 00:53:51.114]  And I've talked to so many black folks that were liberals until they went to Africa, and they saw how bad it is in some areas, and they went, wow, man, I'm glad I'm here.
[00:53:53.052 --> 00:54:01.219]  And again, the nine richest groups in the U.S., except for the super-robber barons above them, in demographics are nine Asian groups.
[00:54:01.219 --> 00:54:04.862]  Then it's whites, Hispanics, blacks.
[00:54:04.862 --> 00:54:08.705]  And blacks are among some of the poorest people in this country, except for some whites in the South.
[00:54:08.705 --> 00:54:09.526]  They're the poorest.
[00:54:09.526 --> 00:54:15.131]  But Bernie Sanders saying, white people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[00:54:15.131 --> 00:54:16.192]  This is insane!
[00:54:16.192 --> 00:54:17.453]  You know how poor Eastern Europe is?
[00:54:19.704 --> 00:54:22.586]  Believe me, it's a lot better than some of our ghettos in many areas.
[00:54:22.586 --> 00:54:27.530]  So this idea is just insane that you're white, you owe somebody something because you're white.
[00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:33.014]  Even if your great-granddaddy was the head of the KKK, you know, and a bad person, how is what they did?
[00:54:33.014 --> 00:54:37.838]  If my dad was a bank robber, how does that make me a bank robber?
[00:54:37.838 --> 00:54:41.060]  What is this thing where if somebody in my family did something, I'm involved?
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:46.324]  That's authoritarianism, but let's finish this clip up.
[00:54:46.324 --> 00:54:47.345]  I'll take caramel.
[00:54:49.667 --> 00:54:52.628]  Is that going to make it sweet?
[00:54:52.628 --> 00:54:55.468]  Yes.
[00:54:55.468 --> 00:54:55.928]  What's your name?
[00:54:55.928 --> 00:54:57.048]  I appreciate you.
[00:54:57.048 --> 00:54:57.869]  Amanda.
[00:54:57.869 --> 00:55:00.889]  Amanda, you are great.
[00:55:00.889 --> 00:55:01.869]  Is it?
[00:55:01.869 --> 00:55:12.811]  You're amazing.
[00:55:12.811 --> 00:55:16.072]  I wish you the best.
[00:55:16.072 --> 00:55:16.372]  You too.
[00:55:19.465 --> 00:55:19.805]  Thank you.
[00:55:19.805 --> 00:55:22.468]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:55:22.468 --> 00:55:24.309]  You gotta get your free coffee out here, man.
[00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:28.814]  You gotta get your Starbucks reparations, man.
[00:55:28.814 --> 00:55:30.815]  Yeah, this is how we do, man.
[00:55:30.815 --> 00:55:32.137]  Black lives matter, baby.
[00:55:34.923 --> 00:55:36.544]  That guy, his other videos are great too.
[00:55:36.544 --> 00:55:39.166]  He's just being sarcastic, illustrating the whole insanity.
[00:55:39.166 --> 00:55:47.672]  You got two young white women, they both look mac-liberal, kind of low-level, well-meaning liberals, not the evil type that control them and manipulate them through guilt.
[00:55:47.672 --> 00:55:48.492]  They're in there hustling.
[00:55:48.492 --> 00:55:50.173]  You ever go into Starbucks, man, those people are hustling.
[00:55:50.173 --> 00:55:51.854]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:55:51.854 --> 00:55:55.457]  And these people are every race, color, and creed working at a Starbucks.
[00:55:55.457 --> 00:55:58.539]  I don't go in there anymore because they're so anti-gun and push all this race garbage.
[00:55:59.793 --> 00:56:06.216]  But I will be going in, I think today on the way home, I'm going to drop by one and walk up and say, I want my free coffee, because you're racist.
[00:56:06.216 --> 00:56:08.977]  I heard you're racist.
[00:56:08.977 --> 00:56:10.237]  They're going to say, well, you're not black.
[00:56:10.237 --> 00:56:13.059]  And I'm going to say, hey, equal.
[00:56:13.059 --> 00:56:14.919]  I want my free coffee now.
[00:56:14.919 --> 00:56:18.881]  When they say get out, I'll say, OK, I'm just illustrating a sociology experiment.
[00:56:18.881 --> 00:56:20.121]  I think everybody should go do this.
[00:56:20.121 --> 00:56:23.583]  In fact, I think this young man deserves a free Starbucks coffee shop because he's black.
[00:56:26.749 --> 00:56:30.251]  But you think about that, ladies and gentlemen, you think about what's going on.
[00:56:30.251 --> 00:56:33.393]  200 million North Africans, those are Muslims.
[00:56:33.393 --> 00:56:34.814]  They're the ones that enslave black people.
[00:56:36.052 --> 00:56:38.253]  They're part black, they're also part, quote, Arabic.
[00:56:38.253 --> 00:56:41.155]  That's a mix of white, Asian, and African.
[00:56:41.155 --> 00:56:42.736]  That's what Arabic generally is.
[00:56:42.736 --> 00:56:45.697]  Arabic's a language, but Arabs, that's what Arabs are.
[00:56:45.697 --> 00:56:47.779]  Genetically tested.
[00:56:47.779 --> 00:56:51.761]  But they still have that caste thing, where they see people that are darker or under them.
[00:56:51.761 --> 00:57:01.846]  You're going to bring some of the most racist, misogynistic people that are the scourge of Sub-Saharan Africa, that's invading all the way down into Africa, and enslaving and killing African Christians, animus, you name it.
[00:57:01.846 --> 00:57:02.647]  You're going to bring them on in.
[00:57:03.817 --> 00:57:04.657]  Now, we're going to break.
[00:57:04.657 --> 00:57:05.358]  We're going to come back.
[00:57:05.358 --> 00:57:08.539]  I didn't get into the Sandy Hook stuff, but this all ties into the same thing.
[00:57:08.539 --> 00:57:10.639]  Just like the media sells these hoaxes.
[00:57:10.639 --> 00:57:14.961]  Not that Sandy Hook didn't happen as a hoax, but the hoax that I am still saying it never happened.
[00:57:14.961 --> 00:57:16.741]  For years I've been saying I believed it happened.
[00:57:16.741 --> 00:57:18.922]  I only questioned it as others did up front.
[00:57:18.922 --> 00:57:22.223]  That's another media hoax to demonize me and try to get my butt killed.
[00:57:22.603 --> 00:57:23.384]  I'm telling you.
[00:57:23.384 --> 00:57:23.944]  That's what they're doing.
[00:57:23.944 --> 00:57:27.487]  But AP got it right and actually admitted that I haven't been saying it in years.
[00:57:27.487 --> 00:57:29.328]  So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:57:29.328 --> 00:57:30.669]  Another big media hoax.
[00:57:30.669 --> 00:57:33.451]  By the way, Xtube was very close to selling out.
[00:57:33.451 --> 00:57:35.272]  I did a rush accelerated shipment.
[00:57:35.272 --> 00:57:36.533]  We'll be getting more in in a week.
[00:57:36.533 --> 00:57:37.934]  So this is about to sell out.
[00:57:37.934 --> 00:57:39.775]  But the 25% off is still on.
[00:57:39.775 --> 00:57:41.116]  But we are running out.
[00:57:41.116 --> 00:57:44.939]  We only have two more runs left currently and may never have Xtube again.

[00:58:56.009 --> 00:58:56.870]  It'd take hours.
[00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:59.312]  Michael's VX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:58:59.312 --> 00:59:00.493]  It's stronger.
[00:59:00.493 --> 00:59:02.094]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:59:02.094 --> 00:59:05.316]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:59:05.316 --> 00:59:06.437]  It's back in stock.
[00:59:06.437 --> 00:59:09.619]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:59:09.619 --> 00:59:12.942]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:59:13.522 --> 00:59:13.602]  It's
[00:59:32.165 --> 00:59:33.946]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:04.708 --> 01:00:13.140]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:21.874 --> 01:00:28.539]  Well I tell ya, we've had Ben Garrison on and many other talented artists, but this guy just does an incredible job.
[01:00:28.539 --> 01:00:36.765]  He goes by Sabo, and his website is unsavoryagents.com at the new punks.
[01:00:36.765 --> 01:00:39.467]  And I agree with him and Paul Watson.
[01:00:39.467 --> 01:00:44.911]  Libertarianism is the new conservatism, I don't even want to call it that, is the new counterculture.
[01:00:47.335 --> 01:00:49.236]  The left is the establishment.
[01:00:49.236 --> 01:00:54.640]  They're the anti-free speech authoritarians.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:00.664]  And he does this street art where it's just stickers and things that can be easily peeled off.
[01:01:00.664 --> 01:01:05.007]  You know, the no-stick stickers.
[01:01:05.007 --> 01:01:07.009]  And then it becomes national news each time.
[01:01:08.618 --> 01:01:10.219]  And now other people are imitating him.
[01:01:10.219 --> 01:01:20.504]  And for years, I've wanted to have the money for an art department that when our crews go out around the country to cover other events, they take some of these with them and then do a stunt in that city.
[01:01:20.504 --> 01:01:36.253]  And of course, you've seen Laura Loomer and others go up to Coward County Sheriff's Department, put stickers on the front of the Sheriff's Department saying, or somebody did, I don't know, it's her, I'm just guessing, you know, saying that, you know, wanted for being cowards and then show the sheriff and the deputies that stood down reportedly.
[01:01:38.351 --> 01:01:40.873]  So, this is a powerful way to strike back.
[01:01:40.873 --> 01:01:43.916]  It's a powerful way to stand up.
[01:01:43.916 --> 01:01:45.658]  And I intend to start doing this in Austin.
[01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:59.512]  I've just got to get the ball rolling and create the graphics and kind of measure them out so they can go and, you know, on some areas in the city and then just go videotape it and show leftist in, because you can set up in a car and videotape it, pulling it down.
[01:01:59.512 --> 01:02:06.234]  It won't be up long, but you get the story of it out, people talking about it, then it goes out into cyberspace and it has a huge effect.
[01:02:06.234 --> 01:02:09.754]  So, very, very, very, very excited.
[01:02:09.754 --> 01:02:12.295]  Also, he had his Twitter account suspended.
[01:02:13.874 --> 01:02:17.456]  Because he is a powerful artist.
[01:02:17.456 --> 01:02:22.458]  And it's been said many times, you want to counter authoritarianism, do it with art.
[01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:25.400]  Republicans are the new punk.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.781]  He did a lot of Trump street art.
[01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:28.561]  He's done so much.
[01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:32.223]  So the next 30 minutes, we're going to go over a lot of this.
[01:02:32.223 --> 01:02:33.984]  But he had his original Twitter taken down.
[01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:35.305]  I guess he's got a new one.
[01:02:35.305 --> 01:02:37.686]  He's going to fill us all in on this.
[01:02:37.686 --> 01:02:38.946]  Is it Sabo or Sabo?
[01:02:38.946 --> 01:02:40.007]  How's the best way to pronounce it?
[01:02:40.959 --> 01:02:41.659]  It's SABO.
[01:02:41.659 --> 01:02:44.080]  It's named after a tank round.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.181]  I was in the Marine Corps and I named it after one of the rounds.
[01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:48.741]  That's right.
[01:02:48.741 --> 01:02:56.063]  Is that the Abrams and also the Bradley fighting vehicle round where it's a DU accelerated SABO?
[01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:57.083]  I'm old school, man.
[01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:59.163]  I was M60 series tanks.
[01:02:59.163 --> 01:03:02.044]  It's like as soon as I left, they switched over to the Abrams.
[01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:04.425]  The Marines get the scraps.
[01:03:04.425 --> 01:03:04.885]  That's right.
[01:03:04.885 --> 01:03:09.546]  You guys were just... The Marines still just a decade ago had tanks from Vietnam.
[01:03:10.669 --> 01:03:12.290]  Yeah, and I was on one of them.
[01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:16.193]  We were putting reactive armor on them and everything.
[01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:21.737]  You know, I was recently in Austin with the Proud Boys, and three bars asked us to leave.
[01:03:21.737 --> 01:03:28.542]  They said, we don't want your type here, and I couldn't help but wonder, what the hell type are you talking about?
[01:03:28.542 --> 01:03:31.825]  The left has gone into just a hysterical authoritarianism.
[01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:34.651]  Oh, they've lost their minds.
[01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:35.492]  And I love it.
[01:03:35.492 --> 01:03:38.536]  It was one year into Trump's election.
[01:03:38.536 --> 01:03:45.143]  So, I mean, it would be one thing if it was two, three years in, but I can't help to see where they go in the next year or two.
[01:03:45.143 --> 01:03:48.247]  Well, let me tell you, you're one of the best artists out there.
[01:03:48.247 --> 01:03:52.732]  When we come back, I want to review some of your great art from your website, talk about how you've been censored.
[01:03:52.732 --> 01:03:54.554]  But at a gut level,
[01:03:56.061 --> 01:03:58.645]  What is the peak level the authoritarian left will go to?
[01:03:58.645 --> 01:04:02.149]  Because they just get more violent, more aggressive, lawsuits, threats.
[01:04:02.149 --> 01:04:03.351]  They say kill Republicans.
[01:04:03.351 --> 01:04:05.474]  I mean, at what point do we take the gloves off?
[01:04:07.006 --> 01:04:12.751]  There is, and I've said this forever, there is no level they will sink.
[01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:20.959]  If you gave them everything that they asked for, the next day they would come back with a list with 10 other demands, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:04:20.959 --> 01:04:22.240]  There's no end to it.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:29.307]  The thing is, Republicans, they just want to have barbecues and raise their kids and have a job.
[01:04:29.307 --> 01:04:31.729]  Everyone on the left is politically active.
[01:04:32.566 --> 01:04:34.807]  We need to learn to do the same.
[01:04:34.807 --> 01:04:41.791]  I know it sucks, politics isn't sexy, but unfortunately, if we don't do it, man, they're just gonna run us over.
[01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:46.093]  Nagri, it's survival, and I want all the listeners to learn from you about street art.
[01:04:46.093 --> 01:04:48.314]  How you do it, how you video it, put it up.
[01:04:48.314 --> 01:04:50.175]  They always flip out and want it banned.
[01:04:50.175 --> 01:04:53.277]  We've got to move against them and use their weaknesses against them.
[01:04:53.277 --> 01:04:55.518]  We'll be back with somebody taking action.
[01:04:55.518 --> 01:04:56.699]  Sabo, straight ahead.
[01:04:58.499 --> 01:05:07.990]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:12.696]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:05:12.696 --> 01:05:17.081]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:05:17.461 --> 01:05:20.504]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:05:20.504 --> 01:05:22.926]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:05:22.926 --> 01:05:26.489]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:30.373]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[01:05:30.373 --> 01:05:39.441]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:05:39.441 --> 01:05:40.142]  Read the facts.
[01:05:40.222 --> 01:05:43.723]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:06:13.118 --> 01:06:24.741]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... It's Alex Jones!
[01:06:24.741 --> 01:06:27.101]  Scum!
[01:06:27.101 --> 01:06:29.342]  Russian scum!
[01:06:29.342 --> 01:06:34.663]  You know what else comes to mind?
[01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:40.670]  Your reputation is amazing.
[01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:42.174]  I will not let you down.
[01:06:42.174 --> 01:06:45.080]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:06:50.296 --> 01:06:53.317]  Sabo, underground street artist, provocateur, right-wing rebel.
[01:06:53.317 --> 01:06:56.299]  He's the badass behind Unsavory Agents.
[01:06:56.299 --> 01:07:04.903]  Sabo is beating the left at their own game and using every medium at his disposal to take back the power monopoly leftists have had in the culture war.
[01:07:04.903 --> 01:07:11.126]  He's been turning heads for over a decade, giving liberals and progressives hell by any means necessary.
[01:07:11.126 --> 01:07:14.347]  Unsavoryagents.com, at Twitter, the New Punks.
[01:07:14.347 --> 01:07:15.608]  And it just clicked.
[01:07:16.028 --> 01:07:16.730]  It just hit.
[01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:20.718]  I'm just going to say it on air because I always have these plans and don't follow them through.
[01:07:20.718 --> 01:07:23.483]  And when I do, the few times it's always a huge success.
[01:07:23.483 --> 01:07:24.144]  I want to launch.
[01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:46.885]  Like an Info Wars, information warfare, art weaponized system, where we sell art to fund the operation, categorize a bunch of great artists, sell their limited works, sell all their works, Ben Garrison already wants to do it, and then we fund like almost street corps to go out and train people how to do it and find other young artists and then paper the entire country with resistance art.
[01:07:46.885 --> 01:07:52.450]  That's how the French Resistance did it in the few years ahead of taking Hitler out, you know, once the US and the Allies invaded.
[01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:54.953]  So Sabo, we gotta get you to town.
[01:07:54.953 --> 01:08:01.000]  I'm saying get Garrison to town because I keep trying to think how do I hire somebody to come in and run this or do it?
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.950]  I think you already have proven with your street activism and your talent and that you're the best guy and then Garrison's great as well.
[01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:09.971]  We need like to have
[01:08:10.592 --> 01:08:11.292]  A partnership.
[01:08:11.292 --> 01:08:12.593]  We need to launch something big.
[01:08:12.593 --> 01:08:16.874]  I'm telling you, I know when something will crush the enemy, as you've already done.
[01:08:16.874 --> 01:08:20.635]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions of views, articles, everything you've done.
[01:08:20.635 --> 01:08:24.176]  And the Oscar goes, the biggest pedophile goes too.
[01:08:24.176 --> 01:08:27.017]  You know, that's what you went and hung on the outdoor.
[01:08:27.017 --> 01:08:29.998]  I mean, the stuff you're doing is devastating them.
[01:08:29.998 --> 01:08:32.059]  And we need to duplicate what you're doing.
[01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:34.651]  Taking action!
[01:08:34.651 --> 01:08:43.655]  So again, if you're a radio listener, you're really missing out, because we're showing this incredible art at InfoWars.com forward slash show, and on streams everywhere.
[01:08:43.655 --> 01:08:48.137]  And I want to get Sabo back up as much as possible, UnsavoryAgents.com.
[01:08:48.137 --> 01:08:55.140]  So, get into what you do for folks that don't know you, what street art is, and why it's such a powerful form of resistance.
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:58.301]  Because even if a lot of our listeners don't think of themselves as artists,
[01:09:00.001 --> 01:09:07.583]  Again, weaponizing what you're doing even further, what I'm doing, what other artists are doing, and just simple statements or simple memes that are already top memes.
[01:09:07.583 --> 01:09:12.885]  If we start plastering everywhere with these aggressively, it will be devastating to the globalists.
[01:09:12.885 --> 01:09:15.146]  They fear this, don't they?
[01:09:15.146 --> 01:09:15.886]  They do.
[01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:17.346]  All I say is hire me, man.
[01:09:17.346 --> 01:09:20.687]  I already have a crew in Austin ready to go.
[01:09:20.687 --> 01:09:25.929]  They recently did that sign that said, Austin is a bomb-free zone.
[01:09:26.647 --> 01:09:27.768]  And I was happy to meet them.
[01:09:27.768 --> 01:09:29.388]  I was there the other week.
[01:09:29.388 --> 01:09:31.349]  And I was checking Austin out.
[01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:32.990]  Austin's ready to go, man.
[01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:38.293]  Outside of Austin PD, having to stick up their butt, we're ready to go.
[01:09:38.293 --> 01:09:39.854]  And as far as why it's dangerous,
[01:09:40.882 --> 01:09:45.184]  It's because it takes a lot of balls to wake up at three o'clock in the morning and do this.
[01:09:45.184 --> 01:09:51.107]  I love taking a newcomer out with me, and the first thing out of their mouth is, oh my God, I felt like a kid again.
[01:09:51.107 --> 01:09:52.988]  My heart was pounding.
[01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:55.769]  And not very many people are willing to do that.
[01:09:55.769 --> 01:09:58.611]  But if a 50-year-old guy can do it, trust me, you can do it.
[01:09:59.744 --> 01:10:02.845]  And as you point out, we are the avant-garde.
[01:10:02.845 --> 01:10:03.306]  It's a fact.
[01:10:03.306 --> 01:10:04.506]  The globalists fear us.
[01:10:04.506 --> 01:10:04.906]  They know it.
[01:10:04.906 --> 01:10:06.507]  They have congressional hearings about it.
[01:10:06.507 --> 01:10:12.110]  Talk about... There's no way to quantify what you've done, but we'll go through your website and show some of these.
[01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:24.856]  I mean, just the devastating ideas you've come up with to counter their hypocrisy, their sanctimonious garbage, their authoritarianism, their fascism of the sickening Hollywood left.
[01:10:24.856 --> 01:10:26.196]  It's there, man.
[01:10:26.196 --> 01:10:27.497]  You know, someone once said,
[01:10:29.005 --> 01:10:30.887]  The right has the better product.
[01:10:30.887 --> 01:10:33.149]  We just have crappy advertising.
[01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:36.714]  The left has a crappy product, but amazing advertising.
[01:10:36.714 --> 01:10:38.836]  And what that means is they have a hold of the narrative.
[01:10:41.263 --> 01:10:47.985]  For some strange reason, every young kid that wants to become an artist just believes that, OK, well, then I'm a leftist.
[01:10:47.985 --> 01:10:51.886]  And they fall in line with that and they become indoctrinated with that.
[01:10:51.886 --> 01:10:59.609]  And it's like, no, there's going to be a. I mean, I'm subpar when it comes to quality.
[01:10:59.609 --> 01:11:10.052]  And what that means is if I can be great at what I do and still be subpar, can you imagine if there was an amazing fucking I'm sorry, an amazing artist out there?
[01:11:11.313 --> 01:11:12.053]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:11:12.053 --> 01:11:25.098]  I want to launch this whole art operation to do it the street, fund it by selling prints and things, and then creating schools every quarter where we get the people in, show them how to do it legally and lawfully, and then deploy them out.
[01:11:25.098 --> 01:11:27.359]  And then when they do good art, we sell it and they make money.
[01:11:27.359 --> 01:11:39.644]  Because you read the Clinton documents and the Clinton Foundation that Judicial Watch and others got, and World Net Daily got, they fear us creating our own economies and our own culture like they did with Hollywood and the big media.
[01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:45.107]  Well, I mean, you pretty much just outlined the way I do business.
[01:11:45.107 --> 01:11:51.294]  It's like, I know a competing crew or two, they won't do anything unless they're getting paid.
[01:11:51.294 --> 01:11:56.299]  It's like, no, I do it because I've been doing it forever because I believe in what I'm doing.
[01:11:56.299 --> 01:12:01.245]  Fortunately, I've got t-shirts and posters that pays the bills that gets the art out on the street.
[01:12:02.924 --> 01:12:07.866]  The missing linchpin is one, we work in a gray area.
[01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:09.287]  There is no legal.
[01:12:09.287 --> 01:12:10.427]  There's no illegal.
[01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:24.375]  I was about to say, we tell people the legal way to do it, and then of course in an information war, whatever they've got to do with this petty stuff, you know, whatever they do, they do, because the left's trying to hashtag kill Republicans and shoot in the Scalise and pour hot coffee on me.
[01:12:24.375 --> 01:12:28.517]  All we're going to do is fight their lies, because they're kicking us off the web, they're kicking us off the internet.
[01:12:28.517 --> 01:12:30.398]  What they really fear is us hitting the street.
[01:12:31.829 --> 01:12:33.451]  Hit the streets, man!
[01:12:33.451 --> 01:12:35.934]  I'm not sitting on your chest at three o'clock in the morning.
[01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:36.835]  Wake your ass up.
[01:12:36.835 --> 01:12:37.956]  Go do it.
[01:12:37.956 --> 01:12:42.341]  It's like, I say ride the wave.
[01:12:42.341 --> 01:12:50.070]  What I mean by that is know what's going on in the news and try and stay relevant in terms of that with your art.
[01:12:50.939 --> 01:13:02.334]  And then the dream is they come try to give you a ticket or arrest you for simply putting a sticker on something and exposing something and now you're all over the news even bigger and instead of selling 100 posters you sell 10,000.
[01:13:02.334 --> 01:13:06.119]  They know this is the way to bring them down.
[01:13:06.119 --> 01:13:08.742]  You know the Secret Service knocked on my door man and
[01:13:10.061 --> 01:13:12.824]  Let me tell you, that was a very good sales day.
[01:13:12.824 --> 01:13:13.945]  Thank you, Secret Service.
[01:13:13.945 --> 01:13:14.865]  I hope you come back.
[01:13:14.865 --> 01:13:19.910]  Unfortunately, I think the next time they come back, it's going to be with a SWAT team at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:24.033]  But all I can say is, there's nothing wrong with being notorious.
[01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:28.377]  If you're notorious, I'd rather be that than famous.
[01:13:28.377 --> 01:13:29.358]  What about infamous, though?
[01:13:29.358 --> 01:13:32.521]  They're really misrepresenting who I am right now, trying to make me infamous.
[01:13:33.633 --> 01:13:34.814]  Oh, dude, you're a legend.
[01:13:34.814 --> 01:13:35.714]  Come on.
[01:13:35.714 --> 01:13:37.595]  It's like, look at you, you're jacked.
[01:13:37.595 --> 01:13:38.915]  You've been doing this for a long time.
[01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:42.897]  And it's a beautiful thing because you get more reach than anyone else.
[01:13:42.897 --> 01:13:49.139]  So, because there's so few people doing what you and I do, you know... That's critical.
[01:13:49.139 --> 01:13:50.540]  I want to become obsolete.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.661]  Everybody else in the media, like, has their secrets.
[01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.622]  I'm trying to give up my little secrets to everybody.
[01:13:54.622 --> 01:13:56.642]  Just like Matt Drudge tries to tell everybody his secrets.
[01:13:56.642 --> 01:13:57.783]  We're trying to win this thing.
[01:13:59.093 --> 01:14:00.154]  Well, you know what?
[01:14:00.154 --> 01:14:03.357]  That's a problem with the Republicans and people on the right.
[01:14:03.357 --> 01:14:04.938]  They just don't want to get involved.
[01:14:04.938 --> 01:14:06.179]  They don't want to get in trouble.
[01:14:06.179 --> 01:14:08.081]  They don't want to get outed.
[01:14:08.081 --> 01:14:10.943]  And that's what keeps us relevant.
[01:14:10.943 --> 01:14:15.707]  And maybe one day, you know, we're saying, hey, open the gates.
[01:14:15.707 --> 01:14:16.828]  Let everyone do what we do.
[01:14:17.589 --> 01:14:21.212]  And when that happens, we're going to be like, oops, did we screw up?
[01:14:21.212 --> 01:14:23.294]  But no, it's really hard to do what we do.
[01:14:23.294 --> 01:14:25.115]  We're going to live in a free country again.
[01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:26.716]  The globalists are going to shut the door.
[01:14:26.716 --> 01:14:28.258]  They're coming with authoritarianism.
[01:14:28.258 --> 01:14:29.218]  They banned you on Twitter.
[01:14:29.218 --> 01:14:30.059]  You have a new account.
[01:14:30.059 --> 01:14:31.060]  They're coming after everybody.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.381]  We are fighting for our lives.
[01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:39.026]  We must get out of cyberspace and get onto the street and then fire back from the third dimension into cyberspace.
[01:14:39.026 --> 01:14:41.168]  I don't know who did that here in Austin, but it's terrible.
[01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:43.711]  You know, it is.
[01:14:43.711 --> 01:14:44.732]  And you know what?
[01:14:44.732 --> 01:14:51.434]  All you have to do is get your butt up on one billboard and you'll realize what to do and what not to do.
[01:14:51.434 --> 01:14:53.255]  The first one's always scary.
[01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:54.616]  The second one's kind of scary.
[01:14:54.616 --> 01:14:55.236]  But you're right.
[01:14:55.236 --> 01:15:01.098]  Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, he wants nothing less than a civil war and he wants to destroy us.
[01:15:01.098 --> 01:15:03.239]  He said that straight out pretty much.
[01:15:03.239 --> 01:15:03.859]  And you know what?
[01:15:03.859 --> 01:15:05.360]  He's not going to destroy us.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.421]  Twitter is going to go the way of MySpace.
[01:15:07.941 --> 01:15:10.463]  And by the way, the kill the NRA was an official one.
[01:15:10.463 --> 01:15:11.704]  That wasn't street art.
[01:15:11.704 --> 01:15:16.387]  The companies will take signs saying kill the NRA.
[01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:18.028]  You know, and they will.
[01:15:18.028 --> 01:15:19.429]  And one has to wonder why.
[01:15:19.429 --> 01:15:25.393]  I mean, why does a company believe that they can run with that kind of crap and get away with it?
[01:15:25.393 --> 01:15:28.835]  It's like, no, we have to show them otherwise.
[01:15:28.835 --> 01:15:32.718]  And when people see crap like that, you know what to do to those billboards, folks.
[01:15:32.718 --> 01:15:34.979]  Counter-strike in the info war.
[01:15:34.979 --> 01:15:36.860]  Let me tell you, man, all you need is a good 28-foot ladder.
[01:15:38.366 --> 01:15:41.090]  And, uh, a couple of guys, and you do your thing.
[01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:47.379]  But people can start small on, like, benches, projecting onto people's buildings, that's legal.
[01:15:47.379 --> 01:15:48.541]  You know what traitors they are?
[01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:50.243]  It's time to take the gloves off.
[01:15:50.243 --> 01:15:52.947]  It's time to fight the authoritarian left at point-blank range.
[01:15:52.947 --> 01:15:53.808]  We'll be back with Sabo.

[01:16:06.823 --> 01:16:07.483]  Awesome.

[01:19:01.585 --> 01:19:05.548]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:19:05.548 --> 01:19:08.890]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:11.432]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:19:11.432 --> 01:19:15.795]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:19:16.155 --> 01:19:25.520]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:32.704]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:33.704 --> 01:19:38.766]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:19:38.766 --> 01:19:46.408]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:19:46.408 --> 01:19:51.309]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.

[01:20:01.222 --> 01:20:04.324]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:04.324 --> 01:20:16.593]  Big Brother.
[01:20:16.593 --> 01:20:20.196]  Mainstream media.
[01:20:20.196 --> 01:20:21.297]  Government cover-ups.
[01:20:22.639 --> 01:20:24.681]  Do you want answers?
[01:20:24.681 --> 01:20:26.623]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:26.623 --> 01:20:33.730]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:39.816]  They were trying to make flu vaccines mandatory, as you remember, a decade ago, and then again about seven years ago, and I just said, hey,
[01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:44.322]  Here's stuff from the inserts saying it can kill you, give you epilepsy.
[01:20:44.322 --> 01:20:46.784]  Here's studies showing it can double your chances of getting the flu.
[01:20:46.784 --> 01:20:47.445]  It's all over the news.
[01:20:47.445 --> 01:20:50.588]  People are getting measles and shingles and stuff from the vaccines.
[01:20:50.588 --> 01:20:51.689]  That's mainstream news.
[01:20:51.689 --> 01:20:56.213]  Just last week, people that had the, you know, measles shots are getting the measles.
[01:20:57.739 --> 01:21:07.402]  And so listeners all over put up little posters, we printed up, people had their own designs, all over the country, they got covered by hundreds of news agencies, and we educated a lot of people.
[01:21:07.402 --> 01:21:09.323]  That's all I'm trying to do, stop the globalists.
[01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:12.484]  So my idea is not even to have Infowars as some centralized thing.
[01:21:12.484 --> 01:21:20.347]  I just want to have it as a clearinghouse with all these different artists, selling their art where they make money, they take action, but the type of art I want to promote is street art.
[01:21:21.227 --> 01:21:22.288]  That's the type of thing.
[01:21:22.288 --> 01:21:29.415]  And then you go put it up, you show the leftist from a hidden car, tear it down, put that out, it goes viral, and it's just so many things.
[01:21:29.415 --> 01:21:40.024]  Now what Sabo does is, from Unservery Agents, is super bold, up there on those big billboards the night before the Oscars, and it gets worldwide attention, and I'd say
[01:21:40.885 --> 01:21:43.667]  Hundreds of millions of people saw that conservatively.
[01:21:43.667 --> 01:21:54.876]  But the stuff about, you know, putting it up with Amy Schumer, the leather special, and just making a joke out of it, how she got one star, which is true on Netflix, so they banned being able to even rate it.
[01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.317]  This guy says he's mediocre.
[01:21:56.317 --> 01:22:01.201]  Boulder Dash, you're doing a great job, and it's absolutely exciting to see what you're doing.
[01:22:01.201 --> 01:22:05.905]  So Sabo, I'm kind of ranting here and excited.
[01:22:05.905 --> 01:22:09.188]  Talk more about what you see happening in this country and some of your greatest hits.
[01:22:10.555 --> 01:22:19.883]  You know, Matt, I love that Netflix, after I did that Amy Schumer bit, they changed the rating system from a star system to a thumbs up, thumbs down.
[01:22:19.883 --> 01:22:27.450]  I have people that call me up and say, hey, I have someone in the State Department that's going to go speak against, who's the one Groper guy?
[01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:30.591]  He was a senator.
[01:22:30.591 --> 01:22:32.471]  Well, most of them are Grover's.
[01:22:32.471 --> 01:22:34.431]  You talking about Weinstein?
[01:22:34.431 --> 01:22:39.392]  No, the comedian, Al Franken.
[01:22:39.392 --> 01:22:42.153]  I get phone calls saying, hey man, I have someone in the State Department.
[01:22:42.153 --> 01:22:43.593]  She's going to come out pretty soon.
[01:22:43.593 --> 01:22:44.914]  So we coordinate.
[01:22:44.914 --> 01:22:47.654]  I did the Al Franken billboard with them.
[01:22:47.654 --> 01:22:50.035]  And it's like, and we affected some change.
[01:22:50.035 --> 01:22:52.835]  How much change I had a part of, I have no idea.
[01:22:52.835 --> 01:22:55.916]  I just know that that went viral.
[01:22:55.916 --> 01:22:56.676]  It went national.
[01:22:57.396 --> 01:23:00.217]  And that took a lot of balls, man.
[01:23:00.217 --> 01:23:03.659]  I was laying in bed going, oh my God, someone's going to die tomorrow morning.
[01:23:03.659 --> 01:23:07.900]  I told my crew, if you don't want to do this, tell me now.
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.581]  And they said, nope, let's do this.
[01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:14.843]  And we practiced this over and over and over again until it became a dance.
[01:23:14.843 --> 01:23:17.264]  And we got that thing up there in like 15 minutes.
[01:23:17.264 --> 01:23:20.265]  It was the most beautiful thing in the world.
[01:23:20.265 --> 01:23:21.365]  It's bold.
[01:23:21.365 --> 01:23:25.727]  And then they don't want to come arrest you or do anything because it gives you so much even more attention.
[01:23:27.842 --> 01:23:29.002]  You know what?
[01:23:29.002 --> 01:23:30.503]  I don't want to tempt fate.
[01:23:30.503 --> 01:23:37.744]  It's like someone knocked on my door the other day, pretending to be with a billboard company, asking for some permission to trim a hedge or something.
[01:23:37.744 --> 01:23:42.045]  And it's only a matter of time before the police kick my door down.
[01:23:42.045 --> 01:23:45.786]  And that's why I'm telling you it's critical to get everybody doing this.
[01:23:45.786 --> 01:23:47.087]  It would bring down the globalists.
[01:23:47.087 --> 01:23:49.547]  Just like I got people to go say Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[01:23:49.547 --> 01:23:52.068]  And that, I mean, they're coming after me for it too as well.
[01:23:52.068 --> 01:23:53.448]  But we got to stop them.
[01:23:53.448 --> 01:23:53.868]  We're men.
[01:23:53.868 --> 01:23:54.568]  You're a Marine.
[01:23:54.568 --> 01:23:55.489]  I'm a patriot.
[01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:56.769]  We got to take them on, my friend.
[01:23:56.769 --> 01:23:57.289]  We got to do it.
[01:23:58.336 --> 01:23:59.797]  For God's sakes, man, join in.
[01:23:59.797 --> 01:24:00.898]  The water's warm.
[01:24:00.898 --> 01:24:06.382]  It's like, uh... Well, I can't say I've ever climbed up a billboard, or Rob Dew has around here.
[01:24:06.382 --> 01:24:15.850]  I can't say our art's as good as yours, but... Yeah, let me tell you, I'm not a heights guy, but you do get used to it.
[01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:16.690]  It's kind of scary.
[01:24:16.690 --> 01:24:21.994]  When we did those three billboards, we put that second billboard up upside down twice.
[01:24:21.994 --> 01:24:23.736]  I wanted to cry.
[01:24:23.736 --> 01:24:26.198]  It's just an act of God we did not get busted.
[01:24:26.698 --> 01:24:30.559]  And what you do is you look at something, you see the satire in it, you create an image, you put it on it.
[01:24:30.559 --> 01:24:33.000]  But, you know, there's this low-hanging fruit, too.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:44.083]  There's Infowars.com stickers that are all over the country, that come in every order, that people put up, and they're just... At one point, it's still kind of like this, they were almost on every light pole in Austin.
[01:24:44.083 --> 01:24:45.363]  You think that freaked the establishment out?
[01:24:46.227 --> 01:24:47.108]  I'm sure it did.
[01:24:47.108 --> 01:24:48.829]  Let me tell you, we could do that in Hollywood.
[01:24:48.829 --> 01:24:51.291]  The only reason I don't... Everyone's like, move to Texas.
[01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:52.412]  Everyone loves you in Texas.
[01:24:52.412 --> 01:24:53.593]  It's like, screw that, man.
[01:24:53.593 --> 01:24:55.034]  I want to be where the fight is.
[01:24:55.034 --> 01:24:56.075]  I live in L.A.
[01:24:56.075 --> 01:24:57.817]  near Hollywood.
[01:24:57.817 --> 01:24:58.717]  You want a guy in L.A.?
[01:24:58.717 --> 01:24:59.959]  We would have a Hollywood office, my friend.
[01:25:04.264 --> 01:25:11.407]  You know what, if you gave me a space about the size of a Starbucks, I'd do a lot of damage in a one-bedroom apartment.
[01:25:11.407 --> 01:25:12.207]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:12.887]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:25:12.887 --> 01:25:14.588]  Listen, they're coming after me, man.
[01:25:14.588 --> 01:25:16.309]  I'm on the cover of Yahoo everywhere.
[01:25:16.309 --> 01:25:17.049]  They're lying about it.
[01:25:17.049 --> 01:25:18.109]  They're trying to destroy me.
[01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:19.670]  I want to go full weaponized.
[01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:21.130]  And the way I do it, it's openly announcing.
[01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:22.691]  I tell the enemy I'm coming.
[01:25:22.691 --> 01:25:23.291]  For everybody.
[01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:24.311]  Don't wait for us.
[01:25:24.311 --> 01:25:25.192]  It's an info war.
[01:25:25.192 --> 01:25:26.092]  Take action.
[01:25:26.092 --> 01:25:26.752]  They're the enemy.
[01:25:26.752 --> 01:25:28.013]  They're trying to silence all of us.
[01:25:29.775 --> 01:25:31.577]  Come, come at me, man.
[01:25:31.577 --> 01:25:32.377]  I'm here.
[01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:32.958]  I'm here.
[01:25:32.958 --> 01:25:33.799]  Like I said.
[01:25:33.799 --> 01:25:36.881]  Well, let's get you on an airplane here next week.
[01:25:36.881 --> 01:25:38.323]  Hey, set up the ticket.
[01:25:38.323 --> 01:25:40.224]  We already have Ben Garrison coming in next week.
[01:25:40.224 --> 01:25:41.866]  So let's just let's let's get it going here.
[01:25:41.866 --> 01:25:48.232]  But I think the real thing is funding artists like you, helping you get platforms, teaching other people about
[01:25:49.498 --> 01:25:54.323]  You know, the different tactics that can be carried out where people won't break the law.
[01:25:54.323 --> 01:26:02.091]  I think you could write a book or even a manual, a little manual we put free in all the orders that explains the continuum of the information warfare resistance.
[01:26:02.091 --> 01:26:06.495]  But, you know, it's just like spray-painting V and V for Vendetta, you know, or things like that.
[01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:08.156]  That's how we begin to turn the tide.
[01:26:08.156 --> 01:26:12.861]  If they start seeing our symbols and our stuff in every town, every city, it will be unstoppable.
[01:26:12.861 --> 01:26:13.742]  I'm ready to take action.
[01:26:15.317 --> 01:26:16.418]  Well, great.
[01:26:16.418 --> 01:26:18.139]  I'm happy you're all jacked up.
[01:26:18.139 --> 01:26:19.279]  I'm jacked up as well.
[01:26:19.279 --> 01:26:25.263]  All I can say is 2020 is going to be the biggest zoo, political zoo, we have ever seen.
[01:26:25.263 --> 01:26:28.364]  And, you know, people on the right have a choice.
[01:26:28.364 --> 01:26:35.108]  They could tuck their tails and run, which I think many of them will, or we could just double down, because let me tell you, the left has doubled down.
[01:26:35.108 --> 01:26:39.250]  And what you just said is absolutely on target.
[01:26:39.250 --> 01:26:40.071]  I'm not giving up.
[01:26:40.071 --> 01:26:41.952]  I feel super excited they're coming out for more than ever.
[01:26:42.705 --> 01:26:46.407]  And it just makes me get up off my ass and take the gloves off.
[01:26:46.407 --> 01:26:48.107]  Dude, they stole my Jeep.
[01:26:48.107 --> 01:26:53.109]  I went and did a hit on Facebook and Chuck Schumer the other weekend while I was gone.
[01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:56.130]  Unfortunately, I guess I must have projected that I was out of town.
[01:26:56.130 --> 01:26:58.631]  They came to my apartment and stole my Jeep.
[01:26:58.631 --> 01:26:59.632]  That thing is stripped.
[01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:02.833]  Right now, it's in a shop right now, getting all the fluids taken out.
[01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:03.713]  No, I get it, brother.
[01:27:03.713 --> 01:27:04.954]  We all take one for the team.
[01:27:04.954 --> 01:27:06.515]  But that's why we're Americans.
[01:27:06.515 --> 01:27:07.575]  And it is so exciting.
[01:27:07.575 --> 01:27:09.516]  And I'm telling you, it's already coming together.
[01:27:10.276 --> 01:27:11.996]  We need to just get a serious plan.
[01:27:11.996 --> 01:27:13.697]  We need to launch the operation.
[01:27:13.697 --> 01:27:19.279]  Just about funding it and the education about information warfare with street art.
[01:27:19.279 --> 01:27:21.839]  I'm telling you, that is where we really go operational.
[01:27:21.839 --> 01:27:23.240]  You're like a general in this.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.900]  We don't need you leading the commando teams.
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:28.081]  We need to get everybody out there doing it.
[01:27:28.081 --> 01:27:30.462]  Then maybe we videotape one of these undercover groups.
[01:27:30.462 --> 01:27:33.302]  It's not going to be me and you or anything.
[01:27:33.302 --> 01:27:35.203]  Going up on the billboards at night and other things.
[01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:43.928]  Yeah, let me tell you, man, until my body decides to give up, my ass will be up on that billboard.
[01:27:43.928 --> 01:27:48.430]  And I understand, for legal reasons, I'm not supposed to say that.
[01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:51.771]  But I'm having fun right now.
[01:27:51.771 --> 01:27:59.054]  So I plan on taking some jujitsu, maybe get my body back in order, and hopefully I'll be doing this into my 60s.
[01:27:59.054 --> 01:28:06.077]  And if I can do this into my 60s, those 26-year-olds, they better get their butts out there is all I can say.
[01:28:06.517 --> 01:28:09.619]  All I can say is target maximum firepower.
[01:28:09.619 --> 01:28:13.181]  I mean, now is the time to go in and to hammer them hard.
[01:28:13.181 --> 01:28:16.643]  And that's why they're scared of you, because they're trying to demonize me with made-up stuff.
[01:28:16.643 --> 01:28:19.364]  How do you demonize somebody that's an artist that only makes them bigger?
[01:28:19.364 --> 01:28:21.065]  History's happening.
[01:28:21.065 --> 01:28:25.608]  And that's why they know that it's been artists and minstrels and things that have brought down many a king.
[01:28:25.608 --> 01:28:28.329]  We need to defend the Republic and its rebirth, my friend.
[01:28:28.329 --> 01:28:30.651]  And Sabo, I'm going to have Rob Duke call you.
[01:28:31.391 --> 01:28:33.892]  I'm glad the crew pushed to get you on because I love your art.
[01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:36.572]  I don't know why I didn't think of this and I've been thinking about this forever.
[01:28:36.572 --> 01:28:51.695]  I'm about to go ahead and just launch this whole art department to help fund our operation and fund others as a whole new capital operation because we've already been successful selling art and I just want to get involved with you and promote the work you're doing at unsavoryagents.com and form an alliance of victory against the globalists.
[01:28:51.695 --> 01:28:54.136]  Sabo, thank you so much.
[01:28:54.136 --> 01:28:55.496]  Thank you and I'm at the
[01:28:56.570 --> 01:28:57.251]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:28:57.251 --> 01:28:59.112]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[01:28:59.112 --> 01:29:02.354]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.
[01:29:02.354 --> 01:29:03.956]  Savory and delicious.
[01:29:03.956 --> 01:29:06.798]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:29:06.798 --> 01:29:07.458]  Awesome.
[01:29:07.458 --> 01:29:10.540]  No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life.
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:12.102]  NASA PAC Technology.
[01:29:12.102 --> 01:29:12.482]  Bacon.
[01:29:12.702 --> 01:29:18.308]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon, or warm and served.
[01:29:18.308 --> 01:29:20.351]  Life-saving, ready to eat bacon.
[01:29:20.351 --> 01:29:22.313]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[01:29:22.313 --> 01:29:25.076]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.
[01:29:25.076 --> 01:29:26.378]  FullyCookedBacon.com.
[01:29:27.619 --> 01:29:28.319]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:29:28.319 --> 01:29:30.141]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:29:30.141 --> 01:29:31.782]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:29:31.782 --> 01:29:34.604]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:29:34.604 --> 01:29:36.906]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:29:36.906 --> 01:29:41.409]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:45.352]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:29:45.352 --> 01:29:49.134]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:49.575]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:29:49.575 --> 01:29:51.196]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:58.442 --> 01:30:01.464]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:30:01.464 --> 01:30:05.666]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:12.370]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:16.113]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:30:16.833 --> 01:30:36.343]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:30:36.883 --> 01:30:41.006]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:30:41.006 --> 01:30:52.234]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:30:52.234 --> 01:30:57.358]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:30:58.218 --> 01:31:04.685]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products we have in Fort Worth's life, it'd take hours.
[01:31:04.685 --> 01:31:07.127]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:31:07.127 --> 01:31:08.308]  It's stronger.
[01:31:08.308 --> 01:31:09.910]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:13.133]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:31:13.133 --> 01:31:14.254]  It's back in stock.
[01:31:14.254 --> 01:31:17.437]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:31:17.437 --> 01:31:20.761]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:31:21.341 --> 01:31:21.421]  It's
[01:31:39.921 --> 01:31:41.923]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[01:31:41.923 --> 01:31:43.324]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:31:43.324 --> 01:31:53.214]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:31:53.214 --> 01:32:00.742]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:32:00.742 --> 01:32:02.163]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[01:32:02.163 --> 01:32:03.405]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:32:04.372 --> 01:32:04.832]  Great!
[01:32:04.832 --> 01:32:05.953]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:10.496]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:32:10.496 --> 01:32:12.177]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[01:32:12.177 --> 01:32:19.741]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, Bison Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:32:19.741 --> 01:32:20.702]  Wow, thank you.
[01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:23.003]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[01:32:23.003 --> 01:32:24.564]  Which super surgical do you like best?
[01:32:24.804 --> 01:32:28.265]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:32:28.265 --> 01:32:28.785]  That's amazing.
[01:32:28.785 --> 01:32:29.545]  That's really incredible.
[01:32:29.545 --> 01:32:32.946]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:32:32.946 --> 01:32:33.947]  I haven't felt this week.
[01:32:33.947 --> 01:32:35.627]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:32:35.627 --> 01:32:36.767]  And I love you guys.
[01:32:36.767 --> 01:32:39.028]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[01:32:39.028 --> 01:32:45.870]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:46.910]  You will love it.
[01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:48.711]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[01:32:49.051 --> 01:32:53.478]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:53.478 --> 01:33:01.230]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:01.230 --> 01:33:03.854]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.496 --> 01:33:31.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:37.865]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.865 --> 01:33:46.892]  The video's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:46.892 --> 01:33:54.037]  MeToo movement assaults conservative woman for asking questions about the Clintons' sexual assault history.
[01:33:55.410 --> 01:33:56.890]  The article's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:56.890 --> 01:34:00.111]  We'll be talking to Millie Weaver here in just a moment.
[01:34:00.111 --> 01:34:02.652]  It was at Akron University last night.
[01:34:02.652 --> 01:34:07.233]  She was also in Charlottesville, Melee, all of it.
[01:34:07.233 --> 01:34:11.774]  So she has so much spunk, her and her great cameraman, Gavin.
[01:34:11.774 --> 01:34:15.895]  What a husband and wife team you've got with those two right there.
[01:34:15.895 --> 01:34:17.475]  So that's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:17.475 --> 01:34:19.916]  The video just went up there.
[01:34:19.916 --> 01:34:20.996]  Me Too Movement founder,
[01:34:21.636 --> 01:34:24.778]  Disparages Female Asking Question About Bill Clinton Rape.
[01:34:24.778 --> 01:34:29.001]  Now, an amazing artist, a great activist, Sabo is here with us.
[01:34:29.001 --> 01:34:34.564]  He's trying to make a final point as we went to break, unsavoryagents.com, at Twitter, at the New Punks.
[01:34:34.564 --> 01:34:38.367]  Briefly, tell folks about your last Twitter account being banned or being blocked.
[01:34:39.522 --> 01:34:42.844]  You know, Twitter just shut down my account.
[01:34:42.844 --> 01:34:48.348]  I had 32,000 people, which I know to a guy like you doesn't sound like a lot, but I don't have a PR person.
[01:34:48.348 --> 01:34:49.889]  I don't try to get people on my Twitter.
[01:34:49.889 --> 01:34:50.809]  No, that's your fans!
[01:34:50.809 --> 01:34:52.551]  That's a huge amount of people!
[01:34:52.551 --> 01:34:57.654]  No, it's a good amount of real people, and they're there for me.
[01:34:57.654 --> 01:35:02.897]  I'm there for them, and they didn't give me no rhyme or reason why they did it.
[01:35:02.897 --> 01:35:08.101]  Don't get me wrong, they had a thousand reasons to throw me off of Twitter, but they didn't tell me one.
[01:35:08.861 --> 01:35:16.767]  And like I said, Jack Dorsey the other day, the CEO of Twitter, said we need a new civil war and the right needs to die.
[01:35:16.767 --> 01:35:22.891]  So if I was a stockholder in Twitter, I would worry and try and throw that guy out because he ain't right.
[01:35:23.575 --> 01:35:23.835]  That's right.
[01:35:23.835 --> 01:35:25.276]  They're getting very, very aggressive.
[01:35:25.276 --> 01:35:26.076]  They're out of control.
[01:35:26.076 --> 01:35:28.578]  Well, listen, I'm going to have Rob Duke call you because here's the deal.
[01:35:28.578 --> 01:35:33.701]  I'm not procrastinating anymore with Soros breathing down my neck, all these fake lawsuits that we can get thrown out.
[01:35:33.701 --> 01:35:36.582]  The media misrepresenting what I've said about Sandy Hook, editing it.
[01:35:36.582 --> 01:35:38.784]  The listeners have heard me for years say I believe it happened.
[01:35:38.784 --> 01:35:41.145]  And then they just keep saying Jones is being sued because he says it didn't happen.
[01:35:42.722 --> 01:35:48.109]  Well, there's a one-year statute of limitations, and I never even said I was sure it didn't happen, but they were crisis actors.
[01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:50.192]  I said, people are saying it, let's look at it.
[01:35:50.192 --> 01:35:51.053]  And I said, you know what?
[01:35:51.053 --> 01:35:52.495]  I can't say that they're actors.
[01:35:52.495 --> 01:35:53.357]  I can't say it's fake.
[01:35:54.434 --> 01:36:01.657]  So now the media is misrepresenting who I am, what I've done, and Soros-funded groups are suing me, and it's the number one story in the country right now.
[01:36:01.657 --> 01:36:12.542]  Not the neocons pushing for war, not them trying to remove Trump, not the illegal judge that officiated Soros' wedding, raiding Trump's lawyer, not all this crazy news.
[01:36:12.542 --> 01:36:16.604]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's Alex Jones is being mean to the Sandy Hook victims.
[01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:17.544]  He's a bad man.
[01:36:17.544 --> 01:36:19.105]  He needs to be kicked off the air.
[01:36:19.105 --> 01:36:20.125]  He needs to go to prison.
[01:36:20.125 --> 01:36:21.406]  He needs to be shut up.
[01:36:21.406 --> 01:36:22.547]  Why do they fear us so much?
[01:36:22.547 --> 01:36:23.327]  We'll talk about it more.
[01:36:23.647 --> 01:36:25.908]  Any other comments to say Bob?
[01:36:25.908 --> 01:36:34.531]  We need a Gloria Allred of the right to publicly sue everyone that throws us off of these social networks and everything else.
[01:36:34.531 --> 01:36:37.452]  Where the hell is our Gloria Allred?
[01:36:37.452 --> 01:36:38.333]  Well that's why you're here.
[01:36:38.333 --> 01:36:40.234]  I was saying to the crew we need to fight back.
[01:36:40.234 --> 01:36:41.534]  We need to get art on the streets.
[01:36:41.534 --> 01:36:44.795]  We need to get in the streets not just in the cyber area and
[01:36:48.097 --> 01:36:50.178]  They're like, we'll get Sabo on it, get these other folks on it.
[01:36:50.178 --> 01:36:51.800]  And so I've been talking and talking and talking.
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:52.540]  We need to do it.
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:56.823]  We need to move forward with just a simple plan at first, and then expand out from there.
[01:36:56.823 --> 01:37:02.547]  And just to create, again, a culture and a market to promote libertarian conservative Renaissance thought.
[01:37:02.547 --> 01:37:03.568]  Thank you so much, Sabo.
[01:37:03.568 --> 01:37:05.509]  Look forward to speaking to you soon.
[01:37:05.509 --> 01:37:06.590]  Thank you very much, man.
[01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:08.071]  I appreciate you having me on.
[01:37:08.071 --> 01:37:08.371]  You bet.
[01:37:08.371 --> 01:37:08.891]  I'm excited.
[01:37:08.891 --> 01:37:10.513]  Very talented artist.
[01:37:10.513 --> 01:37:11.593]  A lot of risk to himself.
[01:37:11.593 --> 01:37:12.214]  Does a great thing.
[01:37:13.848 --> 01:37:15.429]  There's continuums of this, folks.
[01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:16.709]  The globalists are getting threatening.
[01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:17.589]  They're getting abusive.
[01:37:17.589 --> 01:37:18.650]  They're coming after us.
[01:37:18.650 --> 01:37:19.550]  We have to stand up.
[01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:22.151]  We have to take action now.
[01:37:22.151 --> 01:37:30.893]  Joining us is Millie Weaver, our intrepid reporter who loves to work on the road with her great cameraman and editor, Gavin Winch.
[01:37:30.893 --> 01:37:33.134]  And last night, she called me very excited.
[01:37:33.134 --> 01:37:35.575]  Video's now on Infowars.com.
[01:37:35.575 --> 01:37:41.717]  MeToo movement assaults conservative woman for asking questions about the Clintons and their history of sexual assault.
[01:37:44.247 --> 01:37:52.973]  And we're going to let her break down what happened at Akron University in Ohio last night, and then what happened once she went outside.
[01:37:52.973 --> 01:38:10.046]  The video is chilling, how the feminist movement, funded by Soros mainly, the whole women's march led by the Islamicist Linda Sorcerer, whose mother writes papers on genital mutilation, and then the women were obviously watching outside what Millie was doing inside, and a mob of women showed up to go after her.
[01:38:10.546 --> 01:38:11.687]  So this is what they think.
[01:38:11.687 --> 01:38:15.089]  Like Hillary said, these dumb white women vote like their husbands say.
[01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:20.732]  Funny, it's mainly white women I see leading all the feminist bizarreness and pushing racism and sexism.
[01:38:20.732 --> 01:38:22.212]  This is just weaponized media.
[01:38:22.212 --> 01:38:24.654]  Millie, great job as usual for RadioListers.
[01:38:24.654 --> 01:38:25.534]  Break down what happened.
[01:38:25.534 --> 01:38:28.896]  When we come back from break, we're going to play some of the shocking excerpts.
[01:38:28.896 --> 01:38:31.958]  We have to bleep a lot of it, obviously, but of what happened last night.
[01:38:33.271 --> 01:38:36.212]  Well Alex, I was actually pretty surprised.
[01:38:36.212 --> 01:38:46.336]  I was hoping to get a more cordial, respectful answer out of Tarana Burke at her speech yesterday at the University of Akron, but instead I got a vulgar, irate,
[01:38:48.343 --> 01:38:50.985]  Disrespectful response from her.
[01:38:50.985 --> 01:38:52.806]  She told me to shut up.
[01:38:52.806 --> 01:38:56.948]  She said for me to sit my ASS down.
[01:38:56.948 --> 01:39:09.256]  She was very disrespectful the minute she realized that I was questioning her on the hashtag MeToo movement and just simply saying, hey, why were these other women excluded?
[01:39:09.256 --> 01:39:12.158]  Why were they not included in the hashtag MeToo movement?
[01:39:12.158 --> 01:39:17.121]  And the women I was referencing were the women that came out with allegations against Bill Clinton.
[01:39:17.681 --> 01:39:17.821]  Okay.
[01:39:38.228 --> 01:39:58.605]  The possibility of the hashtag me too movement becoming too partisan and being used as a political weapon and if you know essentially that was going to take away from the mission which is to help victims of sexual assault which immediately then she turned nasty was like oh well I wonder who you voted for and just
[01:39:59.145 --> 01:40:17.001]  Suck her mob audience on me with this mob like mentality that all started cheering her on and you know supporting her in trying to bully and intimidate me into silence which then her mic holder ripped the mic out of my hand to silence me so I couldn't even respond to her and
[01:40:17.461 --> 01:40:23.463]  And then, they had security come and escort me out because, you know, they couldn't handle me there.
[01:40:23.463 --> 01:40:32.265]  And also, the lady who was operating the mic tried to steal my camera from me, and I had to literally fight the camera away from her.
[01:40:32.265 --> 01:40:33.366]  And this is the thing.
[01:40:33.366 --> 01:40:41.748]  These progressive, SJW, liberal women, they get mad when they don't like what you're saying, and they try to rip your phone out of your hand.
[01:40:41.748 --> 01:40:45.169]  That also happened to me again after I left the building.
[01:40:46.275 --> 01:40:49.238]  And a mob of protesters came out.
[01:40:49.238 --> 01:40:54.303]  I wasn't even sure what it was about because their banner said, take back the night.
[01:40:54.303 --> 01:40:59.889]  So as I'm approaching it, I start getting flipped off and having women yelling at me.
[01:40:59.889 --> 01:41:05.174]  And that's when I realized, wait a second, this is the hashtag me too movement.
[01:41:05.174 --> 01:41:09.739]  And they were probably observing in a separate room because they were streaming the video to other rooms.
[01:41:10.419 --> 01:41:11.079]  And that's
[01:41:25.854 --> 01:41:47.850]  The meeting, the speech, to make everyone establish rapport with her, and seeming like she's just trying to help everyone, and she's just this... Well, I mean, I can say this, Tyranus Burke, Tarana Burke, and these women, we haven't played the video yet, it's coming up in the next segment, they're just so vicious, they're so hateful, and you're a woman, I guess you went in there without your camera person, by yourself,
[01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:56.175]  And they've obviously been trained and ready for somebody to try to come in and this is how they act like vicious, entitled, arrogant piranhas.
[01:41:56.175 --> 01:42:08.864]  The universities have turned into these anti-free speech bullying dens just like the university there at Georgetown suing me lying about what happened there in Charlottesville where you were covering it.
[01:42:09.724 --> 01:42:11.966]  That's right, this is about censorship.
[01:42:11.966 --> 01:42:17.452]  See, they made a huge deal about any time a conservative speaker was going to speak at a university.
[01:42:17.452 --> 01:42:28.363]  You have these big protests and essentially they shut down that person's right to speak because the universities no longer want to let them hold their speaking events there because they want to avoid conflict.
[01:42:28.363 --> 01:42:32.047]  Now, were there any conservatives out there protesting and silencing?
[01:42:32.387 --> 01:42:36.289]  This speaker, Tarana Burke, and her hashtag MeToo movement?
[01:42:36.289 --> 01:42:37.050]  No, there weren't.
[01:42:37.050 --> 01:42:38.450]  There were not protesters.
[01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:43.693]  See, conservatives respect the right of free speech and people to have differing opinions.
[01:42:43.693 --> 01:42:45.915]  Now, all I did, I did not disrupt.
[01:42:45.915 --> 01:42:46.935]  I wasn't bird-dogging.
[01:42:46.935 --> 01:42:48.456]  I wasn't trying to disrupt her speech.
[01:42:48.456 --> 01:42:48.776]  No, exactly.
[01:42:48.776 --> 01:42:49.637]  You asked a question.
[01:42:49.637 --> 01:42:52.098]  When it came time, we're going to play it all, and they attacked you.
[01:42:52.098 --> 01:42:54.559]  They are authoritarians and a danger to this country.
[01:42:54.559 --> 01:42:56.000]  We must stand against them.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:56.921]  They're coming for all of us.
[01:42:57.381 --> 01:43:03.668]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.

[01:43:58.498 --> 01:44:01.259]  The new product at Infowarslife.com.
[01:44:01.259 --> 01:44:07.063]  In a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top.
[01:44:07.063 --> 01:44:08.644]  The real red pill.
[01:44:08.644 --> 01:44:11.626]  This is a heart and brain pill.
[01:44:11.626 --> 01:44:14.148]  A nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:14.148 --> 01:44:15.889]  But boy, does it stimulate.
[01:44:15.889 --> 01:44:17.170]  Because it's beyond that.
[01:44:17.170 --> 01:44:23.474]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients.
[01:44:23.474 --> 01:44:24.955]  But it wasn't prescription.
[01:44:24.955 --> 01:44:25.956]  But they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:44:28.037 --> 01:44:47.633]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:47.633 --> 01:44:50.316]  It is amazing!
[01:44:50.316 --> 01:44:55.280]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:44:58.641 --> 01:45:05.768]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:29.927]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.

[01:46:04.099 --> 01:46:04.960]  It'd take hours.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:07.402]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:46:07.402 --> 01:46:08.584]  It's stronger.
[01:46:08.584 --> 01:46:10.185]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:46:10.185 --> 01:46:13.409]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:46:13.409 --> 01:46:14.550]  It's back in stock.
[01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:17.713]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:46:17.713 --> 01:46:21.037]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:46:21.477 --> 01:46:21.617]  Yeah.
[01:46:40.271 --> 01:46:42.033]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:20.026 --> 01:47:28.169]  Alright, this video is five minutes long.
[01:47:28.169 --> 01:47:30.830]  There's even more of it on Infowars.com.
[01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:40.655]  People need to see a female reporter being assaulted, being pushed, being grabbed, being cussed at, being yelled at by a mob of hateful women.
[01:47:40.655 --> 01:47:46.457]  And if I saw a mob of men, like Antifa does, treating a woman like this, I would be upset.
[01:47:46.457 --> 01:47:47.998]  We've seen them do that all over the country.
[01:47:47.998 --> 01:47:48.818]  The left celebrates it.
[01:47:49.428 --> 01:48:02.196]  So the truth is they're just a bunch of leftist, globalist, brainwashed women being led by the Democratic Party, bullying the rest of this country and women under their globalist control and trying to integrate them with Islam.
[01:48:02.196 --> 01:48:08.660]  And Europe's calling for 200 million Muslim North Africans to be brought in the next 30 years to Europe.
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:09.181]  I'm not kidding.
[01:48:09.181 --> 01:48:13.123]  That's Macron and the official EU saying that.
[01:48:13.123 --> 01:48:13.564]  Meanwhile,
[01:48:14.528 --> 01:48:21.231]  Starbucks, this is the Chicago Tribune to close all its stores May 29th for anti-racial bias training.
[01:48:21.231 --> 01:48:26.273]  It says run by the former Attorney General who staged riots around the country, Eric Holder.
[01:48:27.625 --> 01:48:34.531]  And the Equal Justice Initiative, NAACP, Legal Defense and Education Fund, Anti-Defamation League, and former U.S.
[01:48:34.531 --> 01:48:36.192]  Attorney General Eric Holder.
[01:48:36.192 --> 01:48:39.315]  They will brainwash all the Starbucks employees.
[01:48:39.315 --> 01:48:50.664]  And then, of course, roll it out for every other business around the country to have the ADL and everybody come in and just create total destruction and infighting and mental illness in the country.
[01:48:50.664 --> 01:48:53.287]  This is psychological warfare, total sabotage.
[01:48:53.287 --> 01:48:55.629]  We're going back to Millie in a moment, but I've got to do this or we won't be here.
[01:48:56.802 --> 01:48:59.064]  You know we're under mega-massive attack.
[01:48:59.064 --> 01:49:14.017]  We have great supplements, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great t-shirts, great books, great films, great political posters, the Peppy the Fraud guy suing us over, all the rest of it, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:49:14.017 --> 01:49:15.658]  And when you purchase the products,
[01:49:19.206 --> 01:49:21.787]  I know we have a record audience tuning in today.
[01:49:21.787 --> 01:49:25.688]  Record numbers on the streams, InfoWars.com, massive amounts of visitors.
[01:49:25.688 --> 01:49:28.988]  The radio stations I know are getting tons of calls and support, TV stations.
[01:49:28.988 --> 01:49:33.890]  But if you're listening and watching, if you support free speech, then you need to support InfoWars.
[01:49:33.890 --> 01:49:42.392]  If you support Millie and our crew valiantly going into these den of aggressive authoritarian cult members and being assaulted and yelled at and hissed at.
[01:49:43.815 --> 01:49:47.520]  Our camera attempted to take, I guess, I guess, steal.
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:49.763]  If you stand with us, then we need your financial support.
[01:49:49.763 --> 01:49:52.527]  We've got products you need.
[01:49:52.527 --> 01:49:54.870]  Survival Shield X2 is simply amazing.
[01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:58.715]  Millie, just briefly, tell folks a little bit about Survival Shield X2 and some of the other products.
[01:49:58.715 --> 01:49:59.316]  I know you're a fan.
[01:50:00.506 --> 01:50:05.489]  Well, you know, without iodine, you know, your body's going to become iodine deficient.
[01:50:05.489 --> 01:50:07.670]  And that's what Survival X2 is about.
[01:50:07.670 --> 01:50:11.012]  It's iodine, really good quality iodine.
[01:50:11.012 --> 01:50:16.035]  And even the doctors, the dentists knew back then that our bodies need iodine.
[01:50:16.035 --> 01:50:19.277]  There used to be a huge goiter epidemic.
[01:50:19.277 --> 01:50:22.198]  That's what the goiter belt was all about.
[01:50:22.198 --> 01:50:28.042]  And they started giving people, you know, iodine to treat goiter and it instantly would reverse the goiter.
[01:50:28.722 --> 01:50:38.007]  They used to have to give school children the iodine to reverse goiter and essentially they noticed that IQs went up even after giving them iodine.
[01:50:38.007 --> 01:50:40.048]  So our bodies need iodine.
[01:50:40.048 --> 01:50:52.775]  Studies have shown that pregnant women who are deficient in iodine end up having children with lower IQs and what I will say, my own self personally, I took iodine throughout my pregnancy and my son
[01:50:53.315 --> 01:50:59.757]  And by the way notice all the headlines about women thyroid issues record numbers even young women getting goiter.
[01:51:14.881 --> 01:51:18.064]  And they don't tell you, hey, it's because you don't have iodine most of the time.
[01:51:18.064 --> 01:51:21.608]  They go, here's some special thyroid medication and all the rest of it.
[01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:23.510]  And again, folks, consult your physician.
[01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:26.953]  But they won't tell people that are getting, a lot of old people have bad absorption.
[01:51:26.953 --> 01:51:31.458]  They don't tell them their skin's opening up, their teeth are falling out because they have scurvy.
[01:51:31.458 --> 01:51:33.139]  Because the doctors won't tell them.
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:35.281]  That you need vitamin C to live.
[01:51:35.281 --> 01:51:38.082]  I mean, it's like water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink.
[01:51:38.082 --> 01:51:39.302]  This is so incredible.
[01:51:39.302 --> 01:51:45.404]  And we have the super blue toothpaste, the super blue mouthwash with the iodine and colloidal silver.
[01:51:45.404 --> 01:51:48.185]  Now in the big 16-ounce bottles.
[01:51:48.185 --> 01:51:50.486]  We have the small 1-ounce travel ones.
[01:51:50.486 --> 01:51:51.226]  We have 3-ounce.
[01:51:51.226 --> 01:51:52.146]  It's all there.
[01:51:52.146 --> 01:51:52.827]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:54.187 --> 01:51:58.750]  The Deep Earth Super Clean Crystal form that X2 has is limited.
[01:51:58.750 --> 01:52:01.612]  You have to get it from the oil companies that drill for it.
[01:52:01.612 --> 01:52:03.233]  The price keeps going up.
[01:52:03.233 --> 01:52:05.815]  Went up on us again to try to manufacture it.
[01:52:05.815 --> 01:52:07.956]  So we may not have this in a couple more runs.
[01:52:07.956 --> 01:52:15.301]  And I was able to keep selling it at 25% off because they're gonna rush deliver us just a few extra thousand bottles next week.
[01:52:15.301 --> 01:52:16.842]  So I'm gonna keep the sale going.
[01:52:17.342 --> 01:52:19.284]  But then we've only got a few more runs coming in.
[01:52:19.284 --> 01:52:20.364]  This could be the end of X2.
[01:52:20.364 --> 01:52:21.225]  I hope it isn't.
[01:52:21.225 --> 01:52:23.527]  This has only happened in its six-year history one other time.
[01:52:23.527 --> 01:52:27.710]  But X2, InfoWarsTore.com, Super Mel Vitality, 50% off.
[01:52:27.710 --> 01:52:29.151]  Super Female, 50% off.
[01:52:29.151 --> 01:52:32.674]  Free shipping on those when you get them with Alpha Power or Real Red Pill.
[01:52:32.674 --> 01:52:34.295]  Those are also 50% off.
[01:52:34.295 --> 01:52:37.557]  Some of the biggest sales ever, and you helped fund us in this fight.
[01:52:37.557 --> 01:52:41.740]  Now, again, if you've just joined us, Millie Weaver's here, going with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:43.382]  The founder of the Me Too movement.
[01:52:44.262 --> 01:52:48.186]  Basically encourage this vicious crowd to assault a female reporter.
[01:52:48.186 --> 01:52:51.209]  We're going to play some of this incredible footage right now.
[01:52:51.209 --> 01:52:51.649]  Here it is.
[01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:58.696]  Don't touch me.
[01:52:58.696 --> 01:52:59.737]  Don't take my phone!
[01:52:59.737 --> 01:53:02.620]  Do you know how to get out of here and put me on this damn line?
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:04.782]  Go ahead and end this damn real quick.
[01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:11.612]  Tarana Burke is the founder of the hashtag MeToo movement.
[01:53:11.612 --> 01:53:17.434]  The movement claims to be inclusive of all victims of sexual assault.
[01:53:17.434 --> 01:53:22.476]  However, some victims have felt left out and even ignored by the movement.
[01:53:22.476 --> 01:53:26.178]  She came to Akron University to speak.
[01:53:26.178 --> 01:53:28.579]  So I went and asked her these questions.
[01:53:30.996 --> 01:53:40.662]  Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broderick all came out with sexual allegations against Bill Clinton decades ago.
[01:53:40.662 --> 01:53:46.106]  They originated this idea of coming out against someone who's powerful.
[01:53:47.066 --> 01:53:51.127]  But they came out before these other women came out against Harvey Weinstein.
[01:53:51.127 --> 01:53:55.628]  Now, why were they excluded from the hashtag MeToo movement?
[01:53:55.628 --> 01:54:00.649]  They were not included in the Time Magazine article.
[01:54:00.649 --> 01:54:04.370]  None of the women were interviewed.
[01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:14.172]  Are you worried at all that the hashtag MeToo movement may become too partisan and be used as a political weapon?
[01:54:14.172 --> 01:54:14.733]  Pause real quick.
[01:54:14.733 --> 01:54:16.253]  Hang on for a minute.
[01:54:17.383 --> 01:54:20.586]  They're saying, who did you vote for?
[01:54:20.586 --> 01:54:23.128]  So the whole point is, they're making it partisan.
[01:54:23.128 --> 01:54:25.129]  The woman marches over, starts trying to take the microphone.
[01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:33.135]  I want to point out, you went up, you asked the question, they gave you the microphone, you did this the proper way, before this all descends.
[01:54:33.135 --> 01:54:36.438]  Because remember, we're also a radio show, that's why I'm narrating that for TV viewers.
[01:54:36.438 --> 01:54:38.179]  They're saying, why is he telling us what we just saw?
[01:54:38.179 --> 01:54:39.480]  I'm narrating for radio listeners.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:45.025]  We're going to keep playing this, but I can hear the tremor in your voice, because these women start to look at you like they want to kill you.
[01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:51.476]  Oh yeah, I mean, it became a den of vipers and she sure sucked them on.
[01:54:51.476 --> 01:55:05.490]  I mean, they instantly started cheering with her and it became a big bullying fest and it's like this witch hunt, this mob mentality where somebody can incite violence or hate towards you instantly and that's exactly what she did.
[01:55:05.490 --> 01:55:06.711]  That's right.
[01:55:06.711 --> 01:55:07.892]  Let's continue, Millie.
[01:55:07.892 --> 01:55:08.713]  Let's continue with the video.
[01:55:09.272 --> 01:55:18.940]  Are you worried at all that the hashtag MeToo movement may become too partisan and be used as a political weapon?
[01:55:23.926 --> 01:55:26.767]  Let me answer your question.
[01:55:26.767 --> 01:55:29.168]  What about- Shut up, let me answer your question.
[01:55:29.168 --> 01:55:39.553]  No, no, what about Bobby Ann Williams, who is an African American woman, that said Bill Clinton impregnated her?
[01:55:39.553 --> 01:55:41.734]  Justice for Danny Williams!
[01:55:41.734 --> 01:55:45.015]  The answer is, this is not a partisan movement.
[01:55:45.015 --> 01:55:49.477]  The answer is, if you want to talk about before Bill Clinton, let's talk about Anita Hill.
[01:55:51.701 --> 01:55:53.642]  Oh, he asked her out and that wasn't even proven?
[01:55:53.642 --> 01:55:56.243]  That's the same as rape?
[01:55:56.243 --> 01:55:57.484]  I'm raising awareness!
[01:55:57.484 --> 01:56:04.167]  I am raising awareness!
[01:56:04.167 --> 01:56:11.990]  Clinton got settled those cases.
[01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:14.391]  But Millie, we're going to come back to Brighton and play more.
[01:56:14.391 --> 01:56:18.593]  They're always only making it about Republican candidates and they ignore it when it's Democrats.
[01:56:19.434 --> 01:56:31.346]  So why is it that her answer wasn't just simply, you know, we do support those women and we do think that, you know, the allegations against Bill Clinton are appalling and we want to support them and extend an arm to them.
[01:56:31.346 --> 01:56:37.552]  And by the way, notice Millie, at first a lot of women, at first a lot of women cheer you, but then they get the marching orders that they shouldn't.
[01:56:37.552 --> 01:56:39.674]  Exactly what you said was very reasonable.
[01:56:39.674 --> 01:56:41.336]  She should have just said you were right and that'd be it.
[01:56:42.352 --> 01:56:47.375]  That would have been it, but instead she decided to deflect and say, well, let's talk about Roy Moore.
[01:56:47.375 --> 01:56:49.436]  Let's talk about, you know, these other men.
[01:56:49.436 --> 01:56:57.581]  But the reality is I never said anything to disinvalidate any of Roy Moore, any of that, or even disrespect her.
[01:56:57.581 --> 01:56:58.722]  I just simply asked her,
[01:56:59.182 --> 01:57:10.746]  As the founder of the Me Too movement, you know, if she was going to support those women that came out against Bill Clinton and if she was concerned if it was going more partisan and being used as a political weapon.
[01:57:10.746 --> 01:57:14.948]  And instead she decided to turn the audience on me and be very immature.
[01:57:14.948 --> 01:57:21.610]  And you'll see here at the end here when she says that, you know, I need to just shut my ASS up and sit down.
[01:57:21.610 --> 01:57:25.512]  You know, like she basically just says... We're going to come back with that on the other side of this break in the next hour.
[01:57:25.512 --> 01:57:26.272]  Mellie Weaver is our guest.
[01:57:26.992 --> 01:57:41.689]  And again, the whole MeToo movement was founded to cover up Hollywood and the Democrats and what they've done and to make consensual sex or asking a girl out the same as raping a woman and Hillary Clinton representing child molesters and rapists and admitting she knew they were guilty.
[01:57:41.689 --> 01:57:45.813]  They are definitely the party that are the kingpins of this.
[01:57:45.813 --> 01:57:46.935]  I say burn the Republicans too.
[01:57:48.302 --> 01:57:53.806]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[01:57:53.806 --> 01:57:54.646]  I take this.
[01:57:54.646 --> 01:57:55.767]  My family takes this.
[01:57:55.767 --> 01:58:00.050]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:04.313]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:58:04.653 --> 01:58:09.295]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:58:09.295 --> 01:58:10.415]  I don't feel good.
[01:58:10.415 --> 01:58:14.176]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:58:14.176 --> 01:58:16.877]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:58:16.877 --> 01:58:22.680]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:25.641]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:58:25.641 --> 01:58:29.182]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:58:29.182 --> 01:58:31.403]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:58:31.403 --> 01:58:31.763]  I love it.
[01:58:31.923 --> 01:58:34.725]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:58:34.725 --> 01:58:35.746]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:58:35.746 --> 01:58:41.691]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:58:41.691 --> 01:58:43.573]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:58:43.573 --> 01:58:45.595]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[01:58:48.464 --> 01:58:51.266]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[01:58:51.266 --> 01:59:01.732]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[01:59:01.732 --> 01:59:02.533]  Scalability.
[01:59:02.533 --> 01:59:04.955]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[01:59:04.955 --> 01:59:06.636]  There's a lot of product and a lot
[01:59:10.518 --> 01:59:11.099]  We're good to go.
[01:59:26.111 --> 01:59:31.895]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[01:59:31.895 --> 01:59:38.339]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[01:59:38.339 --> 01:59:41.161]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[01:59:41.161 --> 01:59:50.767]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[01:59:50.767 --> 01:59:53.369]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.066 --> 02:00:11.450]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:11.450 --> 02:00:13.912]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.912 --> 02:00:15.954]  They're trying to end our free speech.
[02:00:15.954 --> 02:00:20.157]  They're trying to bully us into submission, but Millie Weaver, they didn't do that.
[02:00:20.157 --> 02:00:24.321]  One strong lady standing up against these people, and now they really start melting down.
[02:00:24.321 --> 02:00:26.583]  The full video is on Infowars.com.
[02:00:26.583 --> 02:00:28.865]  Let's go ahead and roll the rest of the tape.
[02:00:28.865 --> 02:00:33.629]  I'm not standing up here and talking about anything political at all.
[02:00:33.629 --> 02:00:34.870]  This is a movement about survivors.
[02:00:35.595 --> 02:00:40.677]  Totally funny about Soros.
[02:00:40.677 --> 02:00:42.358]  Yay!
[02:00:42.358 --> 02:00:47.941]  Now the woman's pushing her out.
[02:00:47.941 --> 02:00:48.801]  And the police are there.
[02:00:48.801 --> 02:00:54.084]  They don't want to let me in here and speak my voice.
[02:00:54.084 --> 02:00:56.465]  Oh my God, she brought up women that were raped by Bill Clinton.
[02:00:56.465 --> 02:00:56.925]  Kick her out.
[02:00:58.274 --> 02:01:07.336]  They wanna get really rude and nasty when I ask them questions about the women that came out against Bill Clinton for rape.
[02:01:07.336 --> 02:01:11.377]  That's Swanee DeBroderick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones, we've all heard the stories.
[02:01:11.377 --> 02:01:12.717]  They don't wanna hear about that.
[02:01:12.717 --> 02:01:23.660]  They don't wanna hear about how these women that came out against Bill Clinton were accosted and oppressed by Hillary Clinton.
[02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:25.081]  What is this?
[02:01:25.081 --> 02:01:28.485]  I'm literally walking out here guys and all of a sudden there's a protest.
[02:01:36.505 --> 02:01:40.889]  I just got pissed off.
[02:01:40.889 --> 02:01:41.489]  Why?
[02:01:41.489 --> 02:01:42.230]  Why?
[02:01:42.230 --> 02:01:44.191]  What do you mean, why am I dead?
[02:01:44.191 --> 02:01:44.451]  Why?
[02:01:44.451 --> 02:01:48.835]  Why can't we just have a peaceful protest and a peaceful walk?
[02:01:48.835 --> 02:01:50.276]  What's the big deal about it?
[02:01:50.276 --> 02:01:51.417]  I'm just, I have no idea.
[02:01:51.417 --> 02:01:56.260]  Why can't we have a peaceful talk about, why can't we have a peaceful talk about consent?
[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:57.641]  Why can't I ask questions?
[02:01:57.641 --> 02:01:59.523]  I got a hold of Millie over there, Zach's coming on.
[02:02:00.347 --> 02:02:02.729]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's always the same litmus tactics.
[02:02:02.729 --> 02:02:08.553]  She's 20 feet away, videotaping a protest coming by that was there in case there was a counter-protest.
[02:02:08.553 --> 02:02:10.955]  They call in the Praetorian Guard, right on cue.
[02:02:10.955 --> 02:02:11.755]  They start marching up.
[02:02:11.755 --> 02:02:13.577]  You're going to see that they know Millie's there.
[02:02:13.577 --> 02:02:16.058]  They've been activated to come out of the parking garage.
[02:02:16.058 --> 02:02:18.300]  And then they come over and say, why can't we just be peaceful?
[02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:19.801]  And then the assaults start.
[02:02:19.801 --> 02:02:21.042]  Why can't you be peaceful?
[02:02:21.042 --> 02:02:22.083]  Why don't you get out of here?
[02:02:22.083 --> 02:02:22.783]  And that's what they do.
[02:02:22.783 --> 02:02:24.705]  They link arms, try to run you over.
[02:02:24.705 --> 02:02:26.026]  They do the same training.
[02:02:26.026 --> 02:02:27.186]  These are authoritarians.
[02:02:27.186 --> 02:02:27.727]  Let's continue.
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:31.403]  What's the big deal about it?
[02:02:31.403 --> 02:02:32.244]  I have no idea.
[02:02:32.244 --> 02:02:37.030]  Why can't we have a peaceful talk about consent?
[02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:40.455]  Why can't I ask questions about why some women have been excluded?
[02:02:40.455 --> 02:02:43.238]  You guys are jumping to- You guys were against her though.
[02:02:43.238 --> 02:02:44.921]  Did I say I was against her?
[02:02:44.921 --> 02:02:46.603]  But you're calling her out on other bull-
[02:02:46.863 --> 02:02:52.807]  When you need to be worried about the survivors, the whole sexual violence, you guys are missing the whole point of it.
[02:02:52.807 --> 02:02:56.269]  She should have just literally said, we support those women too.
[02:02:56.269 --> 02:02:57.569]  Hey, will you kind of just shut your mouth?
[02:02:57.569 --> 02:03:02.012]  I thought all women who are survivors should be scared, and I wanted to know why they weren't being.
[02:03:02.012 --> 02:03:03.413]  You shouldn't be worried about the topic at hand.
[02:03:03.413 --> 02:03:04.754]  She doesn't have to include all of them.
[02:03:04.754 --> 02:03:06.535]  She doesn't have to, that's not what it's about.
[02:03:06.535 --> 02:03:08.316]  And she already kicked you about why she didn't include them.
[02:03:08.536 --> 02:03:17.480]  Literally a massive group of protesters came out to come and accost me and yell at me.
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:19.101]  And so here's why the feed cut.
[02:03:37.438 --> 02:03:43.120]  One of the freaking crazy triggered liberals ripped my phone out of my hand.
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:46.341]  No, don't come back over to me again.
[02:03:46.341 --> 02:03:49.623]  This is the girl that took my phone.
[02:03:49.623 --> 02:03:51.343]  They're in a public place in a demonstration.
[02:03:51.343 --> 02:03:52.744]  They come over to her.
[02:03:52.744 --> 02:03:53.784]  She dares speak back.
[02:03:53.784 --> 02:03:54.825]  They're like, leave us alone.
[02:03:54.825 --> 02:03:56.345]  We're victims.
[02:03:56.345 --> 02:03:57.386]  It's always the same.
[02:03:57.386 --> 02:03:57.886]  Here, continue.
[02:03:59.316 --> 02:04:00.137]  Get away from me.
[02:04:00.137 --> 02:04:02.439]  What's your name?
[02:04:02.439 --> 02:04:03.280]  Millie Weaver.
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:03.760]  Okay, good.
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:04.961]  I'm just making sure.
[02:04:04.961 --> 02:04:06.702]  Just making sure.
[02:04:06.702 --> 02:04:08.964]  Girl, do that one more time.
[02:04:08.964 --> 02:04:10.726]  You're the one who's trying to come into my camera.
[02:04:10.726 --> 02:04:12.907]  I'm going to call the scene if you keep on saying that.
[02:04:12.907 --> 02:04:14.769]  They're coming in her and then saying don't videotape.
[02:04:15.495 --> 02:04:18.577]  This girl's harassing me and trying to attack me.
[02:04:18.577 --> 02:04:25.143]  She literally grabbed my phone from me and she keeps coming up to me and threatening me.
[02:04:25.143 --> 02:04:27.064]  She keeps coming up to me trying to attack me.
[02:04:27.064 --> 02:04:29.046]  Okay.
[02:04:29.046 --> 02:04:30.687]  I've had to tell her please stop.
[02:04:30.687 --> 02:04:36.532]  So I guess this is what happens when you just come out to universities and ask questions.
[02:04:36.532 --> 02:04:42.577]  You have to be escorted back to your car by police because
[02:04:43.857 --> 02:04:47.679]  You know, people can't act like adults.
[02:04:47.679 --> 02:04:49.560]  There are the bullies everywhere!
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:52.061]  They got Soros trying to shut InfoWars down.
[02:04:52.061 --> 02:04:52.901]  What are we gonna do?
[02:04:52.901 --> 02:04:56.323]  We're gonna fight.
[02:04:56.323 --> 02:04:58.684]  InfoWars Live is launching its newest product.
[02:04:58.684 --> 02:05:00.825]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:05:00.825 --> 02:05:03.647]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:05:04.773 --> 02:05:16.260]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:25.345]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[02:05:25.845 --> 02:05:31.627]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[02:05:31.627 --> 02:05:37.069]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[02:05:37.069 --> 02:05:39.330]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:41.351]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[02:05:42.339 --> 02:05:45.640]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:47.661]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[02:05:47.661 --> 02:05:50.962]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:05:50.962 --> 02:05:53.503]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[02:05:53.503 --> 02:05:55.744]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[02:06:03.771 --> 02:06:12.113]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[02:06:15.376 --> 02:06:21.600]  Well, about three months ago, we got secret documents from a gentleman whose brother got in a lot of trouble.
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:29.025]  And they were his anti-marching orders as an officer of the Soros Group, funded by his son, Alexander Soros.
[02:06:29.025 --> 02:06:38.712]  And it was how they worked in 2015, in particular documents, and how they would drill as actors how much breaking and things they would do.
[02:06:38.712 --> 02:06:44.976]  They would work with the Blue City Police first, in Democrat areas, and some police would even volunteer to be hit.
[02:06:45.876 --> 02:06:50.439]  To try to invoke the other protesters to attack.
[02:06:50.439 --> 02:07:02.106]  So they could bring in civil emergency, martial law, that term is used, and bring in the strong cities initiative where the UN, the Justice Department, would take control of the United States.
[02:07:02.106 --> 02:07:03.327]  Now that's mainstream news.
[02:07:03.327 --> 02:07:05.789]  We can play the video clips of Loretta Lynch saying it.
[02:07:05.789 --> 02:07:07.370]  The magnitude is too incredible.
[02:07:08.092 --> 02:07:08.993]  Okay.
[02:07:08.993 --> 02:07:20.060]  Now, the Starbucks, who told everybody to have sensitivity training a few years ago, and white employees should apologize to black people and say they're racist, trying to buy coffee, like, I'll take a medium coffee.
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:21.541]  I'm sorry, I'm white and I'm racist.
[02:07:21.541 --> 02:07:24.864]  And everybody like flipped out and said, that's insane.
[02:07:24.864 --> 02:07:32.769]  So now Starbucks, with its social engineering, is going to work with the ADL, NAACP, the Justice Initiative, directed by Attorney General Eric Holder, former U.S.
[02:07:32.769 --> 02:07:35.031]  Attorney General, to then
[02:07:36.164 --> 02:07:39.849]  Go in and have everybody have sensitivity training from the ADL.
[02:07:39.849 --> 02:07:44.616]  So they're turning them into ADL agents basically to then say gun owners are bad, veterans are bad.
[02:07:44.616 --> 02:07:47.300]  I mean talk about un-American activities.
[02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:48.341]  And then you've got Millie Weaver.
[02:07:49.633 --> 02:07:52.314]  They're in Akron, Ohio, at the university.
[02:07:52.314 --> 02:07:54.794]  The video's up on Info4Wars.com.
[02:07:54.794 --> 02:08:05.517]  And she gets up and asks about Bill Clinton and Hillary and their whole history of sexual abuse and settling things and why the MeToo movement just goes after Republicans and doesn't point out that it's bipartisan and all the rest of it.
[02:08:05.517 --> 02:08:06.437]  They send the police.
[02:08:06.437 --> 02:08:07.457]  She's agreeing to leave.
[02:08:07.457 --> 02:08:08.517]  They grab her.
[02:08:08.517 --> 02:08:10.498]  She's thrown out.
[02:08:10.498 --> 02:08:15.579]  The woman that gave her the microphone to speak, looks like she was trying to grab the phone.
[02:08:15.579 --> 02:08:16.039]  I saw that.
[02:08:17.179 --> 02:08:27.647]  She goes outside, women come over and get in her face, try to take her phone, kill her live feed, try to follow her out of the parking lot, she's got to get a police escort, and that's what happens.
[02:08:27.647 --> 02:08:29.568]  That's what these folks do.
[02:08:29.568 --> 02:08:35.212]  And so Millie, I just wanted you to be able to put bookends on this because it just shows the hysteria they've created.
[02:08:35.212 --> 02:08:36.253]  These are the universities.
[02:08:36.253 --> 02:08:39.476]  This is what the establishment wants.
[02:08:39.476 --> 02:08:40.937]  This is the weaponized youth.
[02:08:42.674 --> 02:08:53.497]  The hysterical, entitled youth that's led by Linda Sorcerer, that thinks women should have their genitals cut off, or her mother promotes it, and George Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[02:08:53.497 --> 02:08:59.319]  And the same Me Too movement is funded by, Soros funds the March for Our Lives movement.
[02:08:59.319 --> 02:09:00.439]  It's all admitted.
[02:09:00.439 --> 02:09:05.861]  And when I say that, the news goes, you're saying the Parkland students were actors and weren't really there and no one died.
[02:09:05.861 --> 02:09:08.942]  No, I'm saying they're PR people chosen because they're anti-gun.
[02:09:09.642 --> 02:09:11.366]  All right, we got to go to Zach here in just a minute or two.
[02:09:11.366 --> 02:09:14.873]  He's only got 20 minutes with us with an emergency report on what's going on.
[02:09:14.873 --> 02:09:17.419]  But just a final bookend, Millie.
[02:09:18.652 --> 02:09:31.320]  Well, what I got out of this whole thing is that essentially the left is going to be able to continue censoring conservatives at universities, whether they're a speaker or whether they're just somebody there trying to ask questions at one of their events.
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:37.925]  And if we don't start standing up and doing something about it, well, too bad, because the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
[02:09:37.925 --> 02:09:39.926]  That's why they've essentially banned
[02:09:40.026 --> 02:09:40.606]  We're good to go.
[02:10:04.362 --> 02:10:06.744]  That's really what I got out of this whole thing, Alex.
[02:10:06.744 --> 02:10:09.967]  And, you know, it's just one of their tactics, like with what that girl did.
[02:10:09.967 --> 02:10:16.993]  She jumped in front of my camera to then pretty much threaten me that if I didn't stop filming her, she was going to assault me.
[02:10:16.993 --> 02:10:20.035]  This is a tactic they use to try and silence you.
[02:10:20.035 --> 02:10:22.437]  This is all about silencing conservatives.
[02:10:22.737 --> 02:10:26.620]  We've been watching this massive purge on Twitter and social media.
[02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:32.663]  And by the way, the Red Elephants was also banned recently from Twitter as well as Sabo.
[02:10:32.663 --> 02:10:40.288]  So it's a purge that's happening right now on our social media platforms as well as on universities.
[02:10:40.288 --> 02:10:40.949]  Thank you, Millie Weaver.
[02:10:40.949 --> 02:10:41.829]  Great job.
[02:10:41.829 --> 02:10:42.350]  Godspeed.
[02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.730]  Thank you.
[02:10:45.307 --> 02:10:49.090]  Joining us until about 40 after or so is Zach.
[02:10:49.090 --> 02:10:52.653]  He is a high-level intelligence source known by name to me.
[02:10:52.653 --> 02:10:55.395]  He's been on national TV, he's been in newspapers many times.
[02:10:55.395 --> 02:10:57.617]  Zach's his real name, the government knows who he is.
[02:10:57.617 --> 02:11:00.399]  He said the FBI come pick him up twice over what he's covered.
[02:11:00.399 --> 02:11:04.282]  But at higher levels, he's now been basically released to tell the truth.
[02:11:04.282 --> 02:11:12.088]  He concurred with our sources inside the hostage rescue team of the FBI the day after the still unsolved situation in Vegas.
[02:11:13.226 --> 02:11:17.567]  That that was a internal Saudi civil war operation.
[02:11:17.567 --> 02:11:26.409]  And then it was a gun deal gone bad that the Saudis that came into town used the gun deal with a guy that already bought guns from to get in there and get weapons they couldn't bring in on aircraft.
[02:11:26.409 --> 02:11:39.592]  Now, to give us all the latest developments that unfold and to discuss the civil war going on inside the White House that we talked about last week, that he talked about on Friday, that they plan more strikes and sanctions.
[02:11:39.592 --> 02:11:40.992]  People said, oh, Zach's wrong.
[02:11:40.992 --> 02:11:41.612]  They said limited.
[02:11:41.892 --> 02:11:44.674]  Then you learned a few days later, they want more strikes.
[02:11:44.674 --> 02:11:47.296]  They want to put troops on the Russian border.
[02:11:47.296 --> 02:11:48.377]  They want confrontation.
[02:11:48.377 --> 02:11:50.519]  All of that confirmed out of CENTCOM.
[02:11:50.519 --> 02:11:53.421]  And now Zach has traveled to the West Coast to learn more.
[02:11:53.421 --> 02:11:57.044]  So we've got a lot of articles to go over here with him that tie into this.
[02:11:57.044 --> 02:11:58.845]  He can't get anything classified.
[02:11:58.845 --> 02:12:01.588]  He just, as a citizen, can give you his breakdown.
[02:12:01.588 --> 02:12:04.230]  But Mattis won a congressional approval before striking Syria.
[02:12:04.230 --> 02:12:05.271]  He was overruled.
[02:12:05.971 --> 02:12:09.616]  Again, Kushner's security clearance downgraded.
[02:12:09.616 --> 02:12:14.102]  We've got the Saudi Crown Prince boasted that Jared Kushner was in his pocket.
[02:12:14.102 --> 02:12:15.844]  All this nexuses together.
[02:12:15.844 --> 02:12:17.006]  Zach, thank you for joining us.
[02:12:18.757 --> 02:12:21.438]  Yes Alex, it's great to be back on and be able to connect some dots here.
[02:12:21.438 --> 02:12:25.860]  Obviously a lot of moving pieces, but yeah, just to get right into it.
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:33.462]  The idea that this strike was for North Korean consumption and to kind of, you know, pressure them and to do whatever they're doing is completely ridiculous.
[02:12:33.462 --> 02:12:37.604]  That deal with North Korea was already signed months ago, as we spoke about, as everybody already knows.
[02:12:38.104 --> 02:12:47.488]  And the idea that North Korea has lost sight or is unaware of the might we have as a military or the idea that we might go to war with the country is completely crazy.
[02:12:47.488 --> 02:12:53.650]  That has nothing to do with it, not to mention the fact that we have just about 100,000 troops currently permanently stationed around their country.
[02:12:53.650 --> 02:12:56.191]  The idea that we would strike a sovereign country
[02:12:57.262 --> 02:13:01.424]  To do that is so problematic in its thinking that I don't even know what to do.
[02:13:01.424 --> 02:13:03.725]  Because what we got here is this, folks.
[02:13:03.725 --> 02:13:06.607]  Listen, I'm a huge Donald J. Trump fan, there's just no question about it.
[02:13:06.607 --> 02:13:09.388]  Donald J. Trump is the most effective president in U.S.
[02:13:09.388 --> 02:13:11.849]  history, and he has done incredible things.
[02:13:11.849 --> 02:13:13.530]  But this is not a professional sports team.
[02:13:13.530 --> 02:13:15.531]  We don't have blind trust, okay?
[02:13:15.531 --> 02:13:19.933]  It's not- I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan, and no matter what the record is, I stick with them year in and year out.
[02:13:19.933 --> 02:13:25.556]  Well, sure, Nikki Haley is openly in rebellion against the White House, shooting her mouth off, and they're out of control.
[02:13:26.738 --> 02:13:28.379]  We cannot have blind trust.
[02:13:28.379 --> 02:13:30.821]  Not in me, not in you, not in Donald Trump.
[02:13:30.821 --> 02:13:36.245]  The only thing we can have blind trust in is the Republic of the United States and the upholding of the Constitution.
[02:13:36.245 --> 02:13:51.636]  So he's done a lot of great things and obviously I'm a huge supporter of him and I did everything I could to get him elected over Hillary Clinton, but what happened in Syria was so problematic and the covering up and the conspiratorial thinking of why he did this, oh it's only limited, trust the plan, is wrong.
[02:13:51.636 --> 02:13:52.617]  This is not it.
[02:13:52.617 --> 02:13:53.998]  If you're going to be in Syria,
[02:13:54.398 --> 02:13:55.338]  Okay, and bombing something.
[02:13:55.338 --> 02:13:57.138]  Why don't you bomb some ISIS strongholds?
[02:13:57.138 --> 02:13:59.699]  Why don't you bomb some ISIS fighters?
[02:13:59.699 --> 02:14:05.780]  He comes out and addresses the nation and says, we specifically attack Assad sites.
[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:06.560]  Assad sites.
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:09.981]  The same sites that the Russians have been protecting with their blood and treasure for years.
[02:14:09.981 --> 02:14:11.441]  You don't come out and say that.
[02:14:11.441 --> 02:14:11.841]  Okay?
[02:14:11.841 --> 02:14:14.161]  He called him an animal leading up in the days up into it.
[02:14:14.161 --> 02:14:15.082]  This isn't about ISIS.
[02:14:15.082 --> 02:14:22.283]  This isn't about some, you know... That was signaling trying to kick off a new war in the Middle East and try to get Russia to respond.
[02:14:22.283 --> 02:14:22.923]  That's what I pick up.
[02:14:24.625 --> 02:14:24.665]  100%.
[02:14:24.665 --> 02:14:26.447]  Mattis didn't want it.
[02:14:26.447 --> 02:14:27.487]  The military didn't want it.
[02:14:27.487 --> 02:14:29.689]  They said, you've got to go to Congress for this.
[02:14:29.689 --> 02:14:32.070]  But obviously, there's some different thinking there.
[02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:33.271]  Trump, he's a smart guy.
[02:14:33.271 --> 02:14:34.752]  He weighs all of his options.
[02:14:34.752 --> 02:14:36.653]  And in the last minute, he made a choice.
[02:14:36.653 --> 02:14:39.254]  And now the question becomes, why did he make that choice?
[02:14:39.254 --> 02:14:40.895]  And to me, it's very obvious.
[02:14:40.895 --> 02:14:42.176]  I believe a deal was struck.
[02:14:42.176 --> 02:14:44.918]  In fact, I know a deal was struck with the Saudi Arabians.
[02:14:44.918 --> 02:14:50.962]  Remember, everybody, the very first trip that Donald Trump made as the president of our country, where was that to?
[02:14:51.862 --> 02:14:56.184]  Right into Saudi Arabia, waving the swords, right into Riyadh.
[02:14:56.184 --> 02:15:05.327]  Now, while Donald Trump was doing all the making deals, kind of on camera, signing everything, make no mistake, Jared Kushner had already had these deals drawn up.
[02:15:05.327 --> 02:15:09.128]  Jared Kushner was in there wheeling and dealing, guaranteeing
[02:15:09.888 --> 02:15:12.910]  Syria and Assad to the Crown Prince.
[02:15:12.910 --> 02:15:16.271]  He guaranteed that in exchange for prolonged weapons planning.
[02:15:16.271 --> 02:15:25.336]  And by our prolonged weapons plans being sold, different systems, different weapons systems, our support of them doing and taking over the Middle East.
[02:15:25.336 --> 02:15:26.316]  Yeah, $300 billion.
[02:15:26.316 --> 02:15:27.977]  And Trump likes that.
[02:15:27.977 --> 02:15:29.518]  He likes to get jobs for America.
[02:15:29.518 --> 02:15:35.481]  When we come back, let's talk about the rest of the story with Zach, who's a great source, on the other side and tie it into everything.
[02:15:36.261 --> 02:15:37.863]  I mean, that's why I got mad on Friday.
[02:15:37.863 --> 02:15:43.868]  My gut was this was part of a huge double-cross and a shake-up inside the White House in an attempt to start a wider war.
[02:15:43.868 --> 02:15:47.392]  Then I tried to back off of that and say, well, maybe it's about North Korea, maybe it's limited.
[02:15:47.392 --> 02:15:49.393]  But now you see it's not.
[02:15:49.393 --> 02:15:52.897]  There's a big schism, a civil war inside the White House.
[02:15:55.089 --> 02:15:57.351]  You have been lied to.
[02:15:57.351 --> 02:15:59.092]  My name is Kevin Shipp.
[02:15:59.092 --> 02:16:01.794]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[02:16:01.794 --> 02:16:07.118]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[02:16:07.118 --> 02:16:12.802]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[02:16:12.802 --> 02:16:16.244]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[02:16:16.244 --> 02:16:19.347]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[02:16:55.834 --> 02:17:01.217]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:17:01.217 --> 02:17:04.118]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[02:17:56.058 --> 02:18:01.439]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:04.320]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:06.301]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:18:06.301 --> 02:18:11.322]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.

[02:18:19.824 --> 02:18:23.165]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:18:23.325 --> 02:18:23.845]  We're good to go.

[02:19:59.665 --> 02:20:08.467]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:08.467 --> 02:20:12.147]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:39.404]  I don't like to get up here and talk about World War III or a new world war, but if you look at what the West has been doing, it's encircling Russia, it's siding with radical jihadists.
[02:20:39.404 --> 02:20:41.645]  It is doing horrible, horrible things.
[02:20:41.645 --> 02:20:46.287]  And five years ago, our military, if you just tuned in, said no to Obama, no to the globalists.
[02:20:46.287 --> 02:20:49.228]  General Dempsey went and said, we're not doing this.
[02:20:49.228 --> 02:20:50.728]  We're going to back the Russians going in.
[02:20:50.728 --> 02:20:53.909]  Assad's made a deal to have elections after they're beaten.
[02:20:53.909 --> 02:20:55.050]  And Assad still says he'll do that.
[02:20:56.189 --> 02:20:57.950]  Trump says that's a great idea, I'm all for that.
[02:20:57.950 --> 02:21:03.032]  He gets briefed by the military, who basically asked him to run for office two years before he does.
[02:21:03.032 --> 02:21:04.633]  This was already in the works.
[02:21:04.633 --> 02:21:08.074]  Trump, you know, kept trying to organize other people to resist this.
[02:21:08.074 --> 02:21:20.740]  So that's why I got so mad at Trump, was because I went home and thought it wasn't going to happen because Mattis said it wasn't going to happen, and then recklessly he gets countermanded, obviously, and Trump gets convinced to do it by Bolton or some other loon.
[02:21:21.781 --> 02:21:25.843]  And we're off to the races and I didn't know the Russians were going to respond.
[02:21:25.843 --> 02:21:26.223]  They didn't.
[02:21:26.223 --> 02:21:27.423]  They stood down.
[02:21:27.423 --> 02:21:28.784]  And I guess it's because it's behind the scenes.
[02:21:28.784 --> 02:21:30.705]  Our military is telling them, hey, we're trying to stop this.
[02:21:30.705 --> 02:21:31.805]  That's what I already had.
[02:21:31.805 --> 02:21:34.346]  But we've got, Zach has got a lot of great sources.
[02:21:34.346 --> 02:21:35.466]  And I know who Zach is.
[02:21:35.466 --> 02:21:38.668]  Zach, tell us, am I accurate in what I said or what's really going on?
[02:21:38.668 --> 02:21:39.588]  What's the latest?
[02:21:39.588 --> 02:21:40.428]  What's unfolding?
[02:21:40.428 --> 02:21:43.149]  Is Trump becoming compromised with a write on his lawyer?
[02:21:43.149 --> 02:21:44.050]  That's what I was thinking.
[02:21:44.050 --> 02:21:46.671]  Or did he just get manipulated by the neocons?
[02:21:46.671 --> 02:21:49.292]  Why is Haley now stomping around like she's the president?
[02:21:50.112 --> 02:21:51.913]  Acting all arrogant and attacking the White House.
[02:21:51.913 --> 02:21:54.215]  This doesn't look good.
[02:21:54.215 --> 02:21:54.795]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:21:54.795 --> 02:21:59.179]  You're right on several issues there and there's several moving parts that are all contributing to this.
[02:21:59.179 --> 02:22:13.989]  So yes, the raid on Cohen's office was very problematic because like we discussed earlier, Jared Kushner in that meeting, that inaugural trip to Saudi Arabia, there's some very troubling recordings that will be out there and everyone knows and it's just going to be out there.
[02:22:14.269 --> 02:22:16.031]  By the way, you said that Friday.
[02:22:16.031 --> 02:22:16.511]  I'm sorry.
[02:22:16.511 --> 02:22:17.693]  You said that Friday.
[02:22:17.693 --> 02:22:19.815]  I just forget how awesome you are.
[02:22:19.815 --> 02:22:20.776]  I have the article.
[02:22:20.776 --> 02:22:21.757]  You said that Friday.
[02:22:21.757 --> 02:22:23.299]  It's now in the news, Shane.
[02:22:23.299 --> 02:22:24.720]  There's recordings that he said that.
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:26.162]  So, you broke that here.
[02:22:27.310 --> 02:22:28.450]  Well, yes, absolutely.
[02:22:28.450 --> 02:22:37.153]  I mean, in uncertain terms, he's basically promising the head of Assad to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, which is obviously problematic and treasonous on a constitutional level.
[02:22:37.153 --> 02:22:45.655]  But why do you think, and we could pull it up, Jared Kushner, at the capacity that he's at in the White House, had his security clearance downgraded?
[02:22:45.655 --> 02:22:50.637]  So he no longer gets the daily intelligence briefings that he was, you know, reading and, you know,
[02:22:51.697 --> 02:22:53.218]  I think we're good to go.
[02:23:12.885 --> 02:23:13.505]  We're good to go.
[02:23:39.953 --> 02:23:46.315]  And they keep saying stick with the plan, just because QAnon puts out some stuff that's true, and I know you know who those guys are.
[02:23:46.315 --> 02:23:47.396]  This isn't a plan now.
[02:23:47.396 --> 02:23:49.056]  We're getting off the Trump plan.
[02:23:49.056 --> 02:23:55.919]  And I like Bill Mitchell, he's coming on next week, but he says, well, there are people that support an agenda, so they supported Trump, and there are people that support Trump.
[02:23:55.919 --> 02:24:01.861]  No, I support Trump and the agenda he originally promoted that lined up with reality and what I supported.
[02:24:01.861 --> 02:24:04.602]  I won't support him if he goes sideways.
[02:24:04.602 --> 02:24:07.663]  So understand, all this really started around the Breitbart issue.
[02:24:07.663 --> 02:24:08.463]  Excuse me, not Breitbart.
[02:24:09.662 --> 02:24:12.826]  Right around, right around when Nikki Haley
[02:24:13.963 --> 02:24:18.605]  Right around when Nikki Haley started running her mouth and doing her own foreign policy here.
[02:24:18.605 --> 02:24:20.786]  Nikki Haley, the plan is, this is it, folks.
[02:24:20.786 --> 02:24:22.867]  I don't know if anybody's looking into this, but this is definitely the plan.
[02:24:22.867 --> 02:24:25.288]  Nikki Haley is looking to run in 2020 with Mike Pence.
[02:24:25.288 --> 02:24:34.152]  They're hoping that in this raid, and they have probable cause here, if they go after this witch hunt, to actually impeach Donald Trump, if they could pull it off.
[02:24:34.152 --> 02:24:40.235]  And they're planning internally for Donald Trump to be impeached and Nikki Haley and Mike Pence to run on that 2020 ticket.
[02:24:40.235 --> 02:24:41.035]  You could guarantee that.
[02:24:41.155 --> 02:24:51.541]  Notice, Saturday Night Live, and all of them for months are acting like Pence is perfect, he's the guy, and now the headlines are today that Haley and Pence are trying to line it up behind the scenes.
[02:24:51.541 --> 02:24:54.843]  Very, very wicked behavior, if true.
[02:24:54.843 --> 02:24:56.884]  Absolutely, and very dangerous behavior.
[02:24:56.884 --> 02:25:03.888]  I mean, listen... Well notice how the media always says Pence is perfect, and Pence could do no wrong, and he navigated it perfectly.
[02:25:03.888 --> 02:25:06.850]  They're gonna burn Pence as soon as he flushes Trump.
[02:25:06.850 --> 02:25:08.051]  He better not be stupid.
[02:25:09.071 --> 02:25:14.996]  Exactly, and this all happened when the Breitbart pet base, Steve Bannon, you know, left the White House.
[02:25:14.996 --> 02:25:16.778]  Everybody picked their sides right then and there.
[02:25:16.778 --> 02:25:20.982]  Trump came out, and notice he announces his 2020 run, and he knew what was going on.
[02:25:20.982 --> 02:25:25.846]  But the issue is, when you have several, several compromising issues, what do you do here?
[02:25:25.846 --> 02:25:33.713]  And in this case, obviously the initial trip to Saudi Arabia, he's fully aware of what Jared Kushner's doing, but he got in over his head, and he had his security clearance downgraded.
[02:25:34.093 --> 02:25:39.859]  They have promised, and whether you like it or not, they have promised Assad's head to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.
[02:25:39.859 --> 02:25:40.921]  And why do we care in America?
[02:25:40.921 --> 02:25:48.209]  We really should care, because this is the continuation of empire building and the military-industrial complex flexing its muscles as hard as possible.
[02:25:48.209 --> 02:25:54.436]  And for all the good that Trump's done, I'm really, really surprised by this, and I'm not sure exactly what
[02:25:54.816 --> 02:26:02.097]  He's behind the scenes that really got him to do it, but there's a couple things that are reasons for concern that I could see him doing this, and the recordings are one of them.
[02:26:02.097 --> 02:26:05.178]  Jared Kushner promised it there, and it's no surprise.
[02:26:05.178 --> 02:26:10.279]  When it came to 9-11, a majority of those hijackers and the funding all came out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:26:10.279 --> 02:26:22.101]  They're turning over, they're becoming more modernized, but at the end of the day, this has been a very cozy, problematic relationship that's been based in money, oil, and blood for quite some time.
[02:26:24.156 --> 02:26:29.701]  I know the Saudis looked like they were in ecstasy when Trump was over there and they claimed they were going to stop funding their terror groups.
[02:26:29.701 --> 02:26:36.067]  And so just because one faction of the Saudis got rounded up doesn't mean the more powerful faction was really just the same group.
[02:26:36.067 --> 02:26:42.974]  And that's all part of that super deceptive stuff that they engage in over there that causes so many of their political long-term problems.
[02:26:42.974 --> 02:26:46.737]  But I totally agree with you, Zach, and here's the thing.
[02:26:48.345 --> 02:26:52.486]  He's dealing with very dangerous people that want power and who want to bring him down.
[02:26:52.486 --> 02:26:59.929]  And the globalists hate Trump because he's America first, he's done a lot of great work, and he has to know that they're never going to stop until they destroy him.
[02:26:59.929 --> 02:27:05.611]  And people like Pence and Haley also want to hedge their bets behind the scenes claiming that they're really against Trump.
[02:27:05.611 --> 02:27:07.511]  So I think there's some survival instinct there.
[02:27:07.511 --> 02:27:08.652]  The real survival instinct...
[02:27:09.492 --> 02:27:14.296]  Is to double down on Trump and support him as long as he follows the original agenda.
[02:27:14.296 --> 02:27:18.439]  Because, again, once the left gets Trump out of there, they are going to go after everybody.
[02:27:18.439 --> 02:27:19.860]  They are loaded for bear.
[02:27:19.860 --> 02:27:21.021]  They are crazed.
[02:27:21.021 --> 02:27:24.364]  They know that we're pulling America out of their jaws.
[02:27:24.364 --> 02:27:27.266]  And so they are on a death mission right now.
[02:27:27.266 --> 02:27:28.247]  They call it a death battle.
[02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:30.309]  Absolutely.
[02:27:30.309 --> 02:27:34.331]  And Nikki Haley engaging in this Russian trash talk is just ridiculous.
[02:27:34.331 --> 02:27:43.095]  Coming out of a Trump White House saying, you know, addressing the UN, looking at the Russian... Who do you think wrote those tweets calling Assad an animal and you're guilty?
[02:27:43.095 --> 02:27:44.876]  I mean, all this ridiculous crap.
[02:27:45.785 --> 02:27:46.506]  Calling him an animal.
[02:27:46.506 --> 02:27:47.546]  We're locked and loaded.
[02:27:47.546 --> 02:27:50.188]  She reiterates, I don't get confused.
[02:27:50.188 --> 02:27:51.529]  It's obvious.
[02:27:51.529 --> 02:27:52.790]  The script's written.
[02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:54.511]  They're hoping for an impeachment internally.
[02:27:54.511 --> 02:27:57.693]  They tried to pull off the 25th on 45.
[02:27:57.693 --> 02:27:58.713]  That didn't work.
[02:27:58.713 --> 02:27:59.774]  He had resolved there.
[02:27:59.774 --> 02:28:01.435]  The wheels came off on Russiagate.
[02:28:01.435 --> 02:28:02.656]  Now they've raided his lawyer.
[02:28:02.656 --> 02:28:03.717]  There's not a lot there.
[02:28:03.717 --> 02:28:04.197]  They're desperate.
[02:28:05.393 --> 02:28:05.813]  They're desperate.
[02:28:05.813 --> 02:28:06.974]  They got some stuff in that raid.
[02:28:06.974 --> 02:28:08.796]  They got some stuff in that raid.
[02:28:08.796 --> 02:28:21.187]  I mean, to me, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter, but for the nitpicking impeachment process, they're going to draw that out because... Oh, so you can call it money laundering if somebody used campaign money that people paid through to launder it, you know, to pay off some bimbo.
[02:28:21.187 --> 02:28:22.328]  Exactly.
[02:28:22.328 --> 02:28:22.968]  It's incredible.
[02:28:24.051 --> 02:28:24.471]  Exactly.
[02:28:24.471 --> 02:28:27.414]  And what happens about the next Syrian chemical attack?
[02:28:27.414 --> 02:28:28.875]  So what do we think here?
[02:28:28.875 --> 02:28:29.876]  Oh wow, that was effective.
[02:28:29.876 --> 02:28:35.201]  So based off of fake intelligence, a completely fake video, we bombed them.
[02:28:35.201 --> 02:28:37.563]  That's the pretext to do that.
[02:28:37.563 --> 02:28:39.885]  So what happens when there is the next chemical attack?
[02:28:39.885 --> 02:28:41.006]  We must respond again, correct?
[02:28:41.006 --> 02:28:48.572]  Because if I was not a fan of Bashar al-Assad, I would be doing everything in my power to set off anything in that country because it's going to get
[02:28:49.033 --> 02:28:52.422]  Sure, so let's briefly talk about how Trump saves the bacon in the country.
[02:28:52.422 --> 02:28:53.985]  We'll be back with Zach's final segment.
[02:28:55.498 --> 02:28:56.718]  Hear that?
[02:28:56.718 --> 02:29:02.100]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:05.001]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:29:05.001 --> 02:29:08.583]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:29:08.583 --> 02:29:16.145]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[02:29:25.333 --> 02:29:26.054]  Face it.
[02:29:26.054 --> 02:29:28.935]  Today's electric power grid is more vulnerable than ever.
[02:29:28.935 --> 02:29:36.200]  From natural disasters to EMP attacks and hacking, the grid could be crippled for days, or even decades in the most dire scenarios.

[02:29:55.959 --> 02:29:59.561]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:29:59.561 --> 02:30:01.341]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:30:01.341 --> 02:30:13.387]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:30:13.387 --> 02:30:18.409]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[02:30:18.729 --> 02:30:22.570]  They experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:30:22.570 --> 02:30:28.292]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:30:28.292 --> 02:30:33.634]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:30:33.634 --> 02:30:36.234]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:30:36.234 --> 02:30:37.955]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:30:37.955 --> 02:30:47.358]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:30:47.958 --> 02:30:50.600]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:30:50.600 --> 02:30:55.965]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[02:32:59.094 --> 02:33:01.735]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:17.763]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.336 --> 02:33:26.698]  All right, Zach's got to go in like 10 minutes.
[02:33:26.698 --> 02:33:27.858]  I got a plug.
[02:33:27.858 --> 02:33:29.519]  We talked to the factory.
[02:33:29.519 --> 02:33:32.900]  There's only so much deep-earth crystals left on the X-Tube.
[02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:33.820]  It's only happened one other time.
[02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:35.141]  I'm hoping to get more of it.
[02:33:35.141 --> 02:33:39.883]  They put us over a barrel at the oil companies where we try to get the derivatives of this.
[02:33:39.883 --> 02:33:43.024]  It's the purest iodine in the world, from 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[02:33:43.024 --> 02:33:44.744]  I hope we can get more.
[02:33:44.744 --> 02:33:47.025]  One time, we couldn't get it for eight months.
[02:33:47.025 --> 02:33:48.566]  And then when we could, they jacked the price up.
[02:33:50.529 --> 02:33:52.331]  We have got enough for two more big runs.
[02:33:52.331 --> 02:33:53.932]  They're doing an emergency run right now.
[02:33:53.932 --> 02:33:55.193]  Some more is coming in a couple weeks.
[02:33:55.193 --> 02:34:01.118]  So I'm going to keep the sale going 25% off and just keep it going until we sell out.
[02:34:01.118 --> 02:34:04.941]  And then we'll have maybe a run and a half left because we're doing a half run right now.
[02:34:04.941 --> 02:34:08.024]  And again, I'm paying a lot more, but we're keeping the price low for you.
[02:34:08.024 --> 02:34:09.525]  The good halogen, learn all about it.
[02:34:09.525 --> 02:34:12.528]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:34:12.528 --> 02:34:17.092]  And Zach, I want to get into the big enchilada we were discussing.
[02:34:18.442 --> 02:34:33.970]  During the break, just lay out in that three minutes what you were telling me, because it's absolutely on target about where we are right now, and the American people need to be very aggressive, very vocal, very focused after you tell them what you're about to tell them, because the deep state is getting ready to make their move on the president.
[02:34:33.970 --> 02:34:34.510]  Go ahead and tell them.
[02:34:35.999 --> 02:34:36.479]  Absolutely.
[02:34:36.479 --> 02:34:45.541]  I mean, what's going on right now is a very entrenched internal conflict to have our president impeached and have him double-crossed by Haley and Pence and their power structure there.
[02:34:45.541 --> 02:34:52.843]  And this is an internal battle that has been wage momentum-wise since John Kennedy had his brain blown out there.
[02:34:52.843 --> 02:34:57.765]  That's the type of thrust-like event of a spaceship taking off.
[02:34:57.765 --> 02:34:59.285]  I mean, if you're going to be that bold,
[02:34:59.805 --> 02:35:00.525]  We're good.
[02:35:19.851 --> 02:35:20.271]  You know, I studied
[02:35:44.885 --> 02:35:52.648]  The Nazis and the Soviets and others, there's always this mental illness, this arrogance, but when you look at the globalists, they all have this sickness of this arrogance.
[02:35:52.648 --> 02:35:55.450]  Trump, you can see it's a strength, a mission, it's the opposite, it's strength.
[02:35:55.450 --> 02:36:05.314]  With them, they all look so wimpy, they're so condescending, they're so sanctimonious, and they're so arrogant, this Soros judge that rated his lawyer and all of it.
[02:36:05.794 --> 02:36:09.115]  And it's like all the crimes they've committed, are they really sanctimonious?
[02:36:09.115 --> 02:36:10.235]  Are they really on a power trip?
[02:36:10.235 --> 02:36:11.496]  Or is it really an act?
[02:36:11.496 --> 02:36:13.476]  They're scared and they're acting powerful.
[02:36:13.476 --> 02:36:14.276]  I just know this.
[02:36:14.276 --> 02:36:15.417]  I got Soros and the Globos.
[02:36:15.417 --> 02:36:16.477]  You can see, Zach.
[02:36:16.477 --> 02:36:19.018]  I'm as big an enemy now as Trump.
[02:36:19.018 --> 02:36:26.100]  Give me your calculation on why they're so trying to get me right now, lying about me, misrepresenting, trying to destroy me right now.
[02:36:28.090 --> 02:36:45.383]  For the remarks that you made on Friday, they know that you have a blind allegiance to the truth, to the Constitution, and for all the good that Donald Trump did, you still came out and said, this is unacceptable, this is a bad sign, because it was your thinking, your base, and this sort of
[02:36:47.446 --> 02:36:49.107]  By the way, I didn't say that to get him off my back!
[02:37:17.062 --> 02:37:19.966]  You notice they accelerated that suit and filed on Monday.
[02:37:19.966 --> 02:37:20.847]  No, no, absolutely.
[02:37:20.847 --> 02:37:23.952]  I know they got even more pissed when I did that because I'm not selling out.
[02:37:23.952 --> 02:37:25.113]  I'm never selling out.
[02:37:25.113 --> 02:37:27.437]  And they hate the fact that our audience isn't selling out.
[02:37:27.437 --> 02:37:31.462]  And they just don't like info wars as people like you and countless others come on.
[02:37:31.462 --> 02:37:32.924]  They don't like anybody having a voice.
[02:37:34.190 --> 02:37:34.610]  Exactly.
[02:37:34.610 --> 02:37:37.272]  And I just want to let people know, I mean, all the attacks were fine.
[02:37:37.272 --> 02:37:39.714]  This is not about, this is not about a record.
[02:37:39.714 --> 02:37:41.335]  This is not about blind adherence.
[02:37:41.335 --> 02:37:43.316]  This is about the second American revolution.
[02:37:43.316 --> 02:37:45.618]  I'm wishing the best for Donald J. Trump.
[02:37:45.618 --> 02:37:50.281]  I really do pray for him every day and I want him to do well, but I understand he's in the fight for his life.
[02:37:50.281 --> 02:37:56.625]  It does not make you un-American or unpatriotic to know the forecast, see the storm coming and let people know.
[02:37:56.625 --> 02:38:03.249]  It does make you un-American and unpatriotic to know the forecast, let the storm wipe everything out and act like you don't know what's going on.
[02:38:03.249 --> 02:38:04.010]  That's ridiculous.
[02:38:04.510 --> 02:38:07.112]  So when this thing happened in Syria, I thought it was a very bad sign.
[02:38:07.112 --> 02:38:10.034]  I knew it was a very bad sign, and we have to support the president.
[02:38:10.034 --> 02:38:12.296]  We have to double down and really support him because... I agree.
[02:38:12.296 --> 02:38:19.040]  Everybody has to call Congress, call talk radio, call everything, and say, attack politically.
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:19.361]  It's time.
[02:38:19.821 --> 02:38:21.863]  By the way, this just broke, Infowars.com.
[02:38:21.863 --> 02:38:28.488]  Finally, GOP demands criminal investigation to Clinton, Lynch, Comey, evidence of conspiracy to overthrow duly elected president, surfacing.
[02:38:28.488 --> 02:38:36.974]  They now have all of the McCabe emails, all of it proving that Comey lied to Congress about the Justice Department not being involved, that his investigation was by itself.
[02:38:36.974 --> 02:38:39.836]  They have them, and Trump has to fire now.
[02:38:39.836 --> 02:38:41.057]  We have them dead in the sights.
[02:38:41.057 --> 02:38:41.838]  We have them.
[02:38:41.838 --> 02:38:43.179]  He cannot wait.
[02:38:43.179 --> 02:38:44.480]  This is the real moment of truth.
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:45.381]  I'm not backing down.
[02:38:45.381 --> 02:38:46.341]  I feel great.
[02:38:46.341 --> 02:38:49.324]  I mean, I actually feel like I'm now filling into the shoes of my forebears.
[02:38:49.924 --> 02:38:51.285]  I'm so alive.
[02:38:51.285 --> 02:38:51.725]  I'm sorry.
[02:38:51.725 --> 02:38:52.646]  I actually love all this.
[02:38:52.646 --> 02:38:55.548]  And I'm not somebody that's into masochism.
[02:38:55.548 --> 02:38:56.649]  No, I don't like pain.
[02:38:56.649 --> 02:38:57.430]  But I like victory.
[02:38:57.430 --> 02:38:58.831]  And I like not being a slave.
[02:38:58.831 --> 02:39:00.172]  And these globalists are evil.
[02:39:00.172 --> 02:39:00.972]  So they have this letter.
[02:39:00.972 --> 02:39:02.393]  We'll cover it more after Zach leaves.
[02:39:02.393 --> 02:39:03.734]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[02:39:05.712 --> 02:39:15.766]  Looking at this, and looking at the left, and looking at how they're weaponizing, how they're building up, how they're doing all this, people have to know that they're going to take everything when they're done.
[02:39:15.766 --> 02:39:20.171]  Hillary was planning to get rid of free speech, implode the economy, re-educate America.
[02:39:20.171 --> 02:39:22.194]  They had it all lined up with all the big corporations.
[02:39:22.995 --> 02:39:23.195]  I think?
[02:39:44.551 --> 02:39:57.743]  I can tell you right now or Matt Drudge or any other patriot, we're winning and now Tucker Carlson and now Ingram and now Rand Paul coming out saying false flag and this is bull and it doesn't make sense.
[02:39:57.743 --> 02:40:06.051]  You can see that people out there have light of justice in their eyes and that good knows their kids have no future if we don't stand against this.
[02:40:06.051 --> 02:40:10.335]  The only way we lose folks is rolling over and those of us that are under attack have got to be men.
[02:40:10.655 --> 02:40:12.938]  And once you get past the fear, there's not fear.
[02:40:12.938 --> 02:40:13.839]  It's good.
[02:40:13.839 --> 02:40:14.740]  There's no more fear.
[02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:16.062]  I don't fear anything they do to me.
[02:40:16.062 --> 02:40:17.483]  And it's not because I'm a hero.
[02:40:17.483 --> 02:40:18.505]  I know they're bad.
[02:40:18.505 --> 02:40:19.686]  We've got to face them down.
[02:40:19.686 --> 02:40:20.107]  Go ahead.
[02:40:21.405 --> 02:40:21.905]  Absolutely.
[02:40:21.905 --> 02:40:29.111]  First things first, we have got to warn and sound the alarm on the next chemical attack that will occur in Syria, because it's just obvious thinking.
[02:40:29.111 --> 02:40:34.835]  Of course, if you were not a Bashar al-Assad fan, you'd be doing everything in your power to set something off in that country.
[02:40:34.835 --> 02:40:42.321]  So when and if that does happen, we have got to guarantee that it gets tested, that we have people go evaluate what really happened.
[02:40:42.581 --> 02:40:44.144]  And Trump knows that and he's trying to act like...
[02:40:58.624 --> 02:40:59.205]  Let's just say it.
[02:40:59.205 --> 02:41:15.508]  It looks like Trump has gone along with the plan to make it look like he's being reasonable to cross red lines, and then when the rebels cross it for him, we're going to attack and take out a side, betraying everything Trump said he would do, and turn the country over to be broken up, occupied by Saudi Arabia, so every non-radical gets murdered and tortured to death.
[02:41:16.681 --> 02:41:23.424]  Exactly, and they have a nice little line saying, oh, there'll be an army comprised of Arab countries taking care of Syria that the U.S.
[02:41:23.424 --> 02:41:24.185]  is going to pull out.
[02:41:24.185 --> 02:41:25.725]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:41:25.725 --> 02:41:28.206]  What do you mean an army comprised of Arab countries?
[02:41:28.206 --> 02:41:30.408]  That's an invasion force, just like they did before!
[02:41:30.408 --> 02:41:31.528]  There's not an army.
[02:41:31.528 --> 02:41:33.089]  There's a Syrian army.
[02:41:33.089 --> 02:41:34.890]  It's a sovereign country.
[02:41:34.890 --> 02:41:37.331]  We're not taking our army out and putting another army in.
[02:41:37.331 --> 02:41:39.632]  That's called Libya, that's called Afghanistan, that's called everything else.
[02:41:39.972 --> 02:41:41.633]  And by the way, the Syrians will fight.
[02:41:41.633 --> 02:41:44.115]  I mean, look at the civil war they just fought.
[02:41:44.115 --> 02:41:44.936]  They're going to continue to fight.
[02:41:47.950 --> 02:41:49.831]  They're in the fight for their life every single day.
[02:41:49.831 --> 02:41:53.772]  I mean, every single day could be your last day on Earth there.
[02:41:53.772 --> 02:41:55.332]  So they're dead serious about it.
[02:41:55.332 --> 02:41:57.113]  We need to be dead serious about it.
[02:41:57.113 --> 02:42:05.696]  This is the perpetual momentum of the military-industrial complex and the intelligence agencies since John F. Kennedy's brains have been blown out in the back of that Cadillac.
[02:42:05.696 --> 02:42:06.536]  This is it.
[02:42:06.536 --> 02:42:07.336]  This is everything.
[02:42:07.336 --> 02:42:08.136]  This is 9-11.
[02:42:08.136 --> 02:42:09.057]  This is Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:42:09.057 --> 02:42:09.737]  This is Vietnam.
[02:42:10.017 --> 02:42:18.263]  This is everything is leading up to this moment where we have got to back our president and really get through to him and say, do what you can because this is it.
[02:42:18.263 --> 02:42:19.944]  We're not going to have another Donald Trump in office.
[02:42:19.944 --> 02:42:24.347]  God knows what follows behind Donald Trump, but it will not be the chance that we have now.
[02:42:24.347 --> 02:42:25.988]  We must seize the moment.
[02:42:25.988 --> 02:42:26.448]  That's right.
[02:42:26.448 --> 02:42:29.250]  Syria is the last domino and then it goes into war with Russia.
[02:42:29.250 --> 02:42:30.431]  The whole nine yards.
[02:42:30.431 --> 02:42:31.732]  They've got it planned.
[02:42:31.732 --> 02:42:34.654]  Jack, come back as soon as you can to give us more briefings.
[02:42:34.654 --> 02:42:35.414]  I know you got to go.
[02:42:35.414 --> 02:42:35.894]  You got to go.
[02:42:35.894 --> 02:42:37.555]  You want to add any other points you can hold over?
[02:42:37.555 --> 02:42:37.876]  You got to go.
[02:42:39.008 --> 02:42:39.248]  That's it.
[02:42:39.248 --> 02:42:39.568]  Yeah, I gotta go.
[02:42:39.568 --> 02:42:39.748]  Gotta go.
[02:42:39.748 --> 02:42:40.129]  Sorry about that.
[02:42:40.129 --> 02:42:40.969]  Alright, thank you very much.
[02:42:40.969 --> 02:42:42.049]  I know you're at your lunch.
[02:42:42.049 --> 02:42:42.830]  There goes Zach.
[02:42:42.830 --> 02:42:45.471]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side.
[02:42:45.471 --> 02:42:46.552]  What a time to be alive.
[02:42:46.552 --> 02:42:52.354]  Toe to toe with Nazi collaborator George Soros, running the Deep State Breakaway Group, trying to start World War III.
[02:42:52.354 --> 02:42:54.956]  Pray to Jesus for peace.
[02:42:54.956 --> 02:42:55.816]  Mike in Arizona.
[02:42:55.816 --> 02:42:56.857]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:42:56.857 --> 02:42:57.177]  Go ahead.
[02:42:58.101 --> 02:43:00.023]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:43:00.023 --> 02:43:10.532]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:43:10.532 --> 02:43:13.895]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:43:14.375 --> 02:43:14.635]  Absolutely.
[02:43:36.810 --> 02:43:50.053]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:43:54.702 --> 02:43:59.104]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.

[02:44:12.490 --> 02:44:15.031]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.

[02:46:24.634 --> 02:46:27.396]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:46:59.091 --> 02:47:19.962]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.962 --> 02:47:25.325]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are anti-American, they're anti-free market, they're ultra-rich, but they want you to be poor.
[02:47:26.593 --> 02:47:38.119]  And they've been running major psyops against me for 20 years, but in the last three, as everybody knows, for the middle of the campaign till now, it's been intense.
[02:47:38.119 --> 02:47:51.806]  And I learned that they know I'm so truthful and the globalists respect me so much, and I'm not saying that as a power trip, I've only learned this recently, that they believe everything I say.
[02:47:51.806 --> 02:47:54.167]  And I'm right most of the time, I'm wrong sometimes.
[02:47:54.974 --> 02:48:00.136]  But the whole Sandy Hook secret is this.
[02:48:00.136 --> 02:48:02.437]  And I'll go ahead and say it all on air.
[02:48:02.437 --> 02:48:05.758]  The whole truth, nothing but the truth.
[02:48:05.758 --> 02:48:10.701]  They thought because I backed off saying I didn't think all of Sandy Hook was real.
[02:48:10.701 --> 02:48:12.361]  I never said they were all crisis actors.
[02:48:12.361 --> 02:48:14.382]  I never said nobody, you know, died.
[02:48:14.382 --> 02:48:17.263]  I said I could see how people believe that.
[02:48:17.263 --> 02:48:18.644]  Because people have been lied to so much.
[02:48:18.644 --> 02:48:20.725]  But they edited those tapes together.
[02:48:20.725 --> 02:48:23.486]  But if I thought really it was all staged, nobody died, I'd say it.
[02:48:25.407 --> 02:48:36.713]  And you all saw them with the whole thing a couple months ago on Valentine's Day, the tragic event in Parkland, say that I said nobody died, they were crisis actors.
[02:48:36.713 --> 02:48:45.838]  No, I said they chose Democrat kids, young people, who were already anti-gun, who already did internships at CNN, who were in the art department in the
[02:48:47.688 --> 02:48:54.571]  Acting department, in the drama department, to then be chosen as the spokesperson of the anti-gun, and funded by Soros.
[02:48:54.571 --> 02:48:56.832]  That's all admitted!
[02:48:56.832 --> 02:48:57.853]  But they misrepresented.
[02:48:57.853 --> 02:49:09.158]  But in the case of Sandy Hook, early on, I just saw another mass shooting, and then there's a guy in the woods with a gun, and another guy, and then the news said, we made that up.
[02:49:09.158 --> 02:49:13.460]  There wasn't a guy on a helicopter in the woods, and we saw the news.
[02:49:13.460 --> 02:49:15.801]  They said, forget about that, and there wasn't a police drill that day.
[02:49:17.332 --> 02:49:26.517]  And so there's a bunch of anomalies, and so my listeners went, look, these are crisis actors, and look, this guy's laughing, and now this guy's, you know, crying, in the space of seconds.
[02:49:26.517 --> 02:49:29.418]  And I said, well, her parents can do that.
[02:49:29.418 --> 02:49:33.680]  Then I said, you know, I can see how there's dead babies and, you know, incubators that didn't exist that people question.
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:35.561]  You have a right to.
[02:49:35.561 --> 02:49:40.024]  So they took the fact that I war-gamed it and didn't really even demonize me at the time.
[02:49:40.024 --> 02:49:43.465]  And then Paul Watson, about six months after it, said, look, I like working for InfoWars.
[02:49:43.465 --> 02:49:44.686]  It's the only time Paul's ever done it.
[02:49:46.340 --> 02:49:50.484]  But he said, this is bull, these groups that say it's crisis actors, have you noticed?
[02:49:50.484 --> 02:49:53.687]  They also say you're Jeff Bridges and they say you're Bill Hicks.
[02:49:53.687 --> 02:49:55.108]  That was like five years ago.
[02:49:55.108 --> 02:49:57.651]  We laugh at that, but these people believe that.
[02:49:57.651 --> 02:50:00.013]  And I went, yeah, it's crazy.
[02:50:00.013 --> 02:50:05.939]  And then the very groups would get mad at me because I wouldn't constantly harp on Sandy Hook and say I knew it was fake for sure.
[02:50:05.939 --> 02:50:10.723]  So about a year after, I started saying, you know, I can see how you think nobody died, but you know what?
[02:50:10.723 --> 02:50:11.364]  I think it happened.
[02:50:13.083 --> 02:50:16.344]  And I'm not gonna sit there and look at parents and say it, you know, that it didn't.
[02:50:16.344 --> 02:50:17.664]  School shootings happened.
[02:50:17.664 --> 02:50:19.724]  Are the Democrats seizing on it, blaming the Second Amendment?
[02:50:19.724 --> 02:50:22.625]  You bet.
[02:50:22.625 --> 02:50:24.865]  And everybody's heard me that's been listening since then.
[02:50:24.865 --> 02:50:29.306]  A lot of you have been listening for five years, some of you 20 years, but most of you have been listening, you know, just for a year or so.
[02:50:29.306 --> 02:50:31.726]  You've heard me, what, every week?
[02:50:31.726 --> 02:50:35.147]  They got articles saying I say nobody died, and they've always got new ones.
[02:50:35.147 --> 02:50:40.888]  Jones just said nobody died last week, and they'll show some edited three-year-old clip, or four-year-old clip.
[02:50:42.045 --> 02:50:43.106]  So I get what happened.
[02:50:43.106 --> 02:50:47.828]  They saw me kind of entertain it.
[02:50:47.828 --> 02:50:49.309]  It was viral all over the internet.
[02:50:49.309 --> 02:50:53.191]  Hundreds of millions of views just on our videos discussing it.
[02:50:53.191 --> 02:50:56.292]  YouTube deleted them.
[02:50:56.292 --> 02:51:01.095]  And then I started saying, you know, I think people died there.
[02:51:01.095 --> 02:51:04.136]  Because I was getting threatened by people that said nobody died.
[02:51:04.136 --> 02:51:05.597]  And saying I was involved.
[02:51:05.597 --> 02:51:07.038]  And I went, this is a little bit schizophrenic.
[02:51:09.315 --> 02:51:13.997]  And so Paul, who I really trust, and who's just as smart as I am, or smarter, he said, you got to get away from this.
[02:51:13.997 --> 02:51:14.758]  Don't even entertain it.
[02:51:14.758 --> 02:51:16.239]  They're nuts.
[02:51:16.239 --> 02:51:17.479]  Don't even have debates.
[02:51:17.479 --> 02:51:21.121]  I went and told my crew, I said, I don't tell you what to do most of the time, but I said, just stay away from the Sandy Hook.
[02:51:21.121 --> 02:51:24.183]  This is like four years ago.
[02:51:24.183 --> 02:51:26.944]  And the media saw that and they went, he's weak.
[02:51:26.944 --> 02:51:30.886]  They think I'm like a sociopath like them, but that I tell the truth.
[02:51:30.886 --> 02:51:32.147]  And so they went, oh, we got him.
[02:51:32.147 --> 02:51:35.529]  Jones is saying it happened and stopped saying it didn't.
[02:51:35.529 --> 02:51:36.189]  He backed off.
[02:51:36.189 --> 02:51:36.849]  We got him.
[02:51:36.849 --> 02:51:37.570]  He admits he's wrong.
[02:51:38.752 --> 02:51:42.997]  And I went, no, I just entertained all the angles, because government staged stuff before, so we have a right.
[02:51:42.997 --> 02:51:51.748]  And Aurora, the guy was in a DARPA program with his dad, and there were other shooters, and a stand-down was ordered, and the guy says he was drugged up by the government, and that he was a patsy.
[02:51:51.748 --> 02:51:54.171]  That was in the local news, but never got national news.
[02:51:54.171 --> 02:51:56.454]  I'm saying Aurora was staged.
[02:51:56.454 --> 02:51:57.936]  I don't know exactly how, but we know.
[02:51:59.158 --> 02:52:04.900]  So they'll take me talking about Aurora or other events, edit it together deceptively, and then just every day it's the same story.
[02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:05.321]  You've seen it.
[02:52:05.321 --> 02:52:10.283]  It's got to be one of the most reported stories ever of fake news, a giant hoax.
[02:52:10.283 --> 02:52:14.504]  And see, this is good for me and you and everybody to understand the anatomy of how fake news works.
[02:52:14.504 --> 02:52:15.665]  Because you've been listening a long time.
[02:52:15.665 --> 02:52:19.787]  You've heard me say over and over again, I believe people died at Sandy Hook.
[02:52:19.787 --> 02:52:22.868]  I was unequivocal last year, a year ago, with Megan Kelly.
[02:52:24.031 --> 02:52:28.392]  She edited, she kept arguing with me about it, saying, well, why did you question it before?
[02:52:28.392 --> 02:52:31.853]  So I'd say, well, this and that, then they would have my, why are you saying no kids died?
[02:52:31.853 --> 02:52:36.434]  And it would cut to me going, remember, I recorded it.
[02:52:36.434 --> 02:52:38.675]  She'd take something from 10 minutes before and put it together.
[02:52:38.675 --> 02:52:42.576]  Well, it's because of the green screen and Anderson Cooper, or, or, well, I have a right to.
[02:52:42.576 --> 02:52:45.977]  They were just editing it together to deceive.
[02:52:45.977 --> 02:52:48.798]  Because they somehow think because I
[02:52:50.410 --> 02:53:05.526]  Develop my ideas on this and pulled away from even really overall questioning it for some word anomalies to move on because they've built their whole house of cards on this to where Alex Jones is the Sandy Hook didn't happen guy.
[02:53:05.526 --> 02:53:07.629]  So then they file this lawsuit Monday.
[02:53:09.653 --> 02:53:12.854]  They send a letter, they say, retract this or we're going to sue.
[02:53:12.854 --> 02:53:14.394]  That's last Thursday.
[02:53:14.394 --> 02:53:15.254]  On Monday, they sue.
[02:53:15.254 --> 02:53:16.774]  It's not even statutory.
[02:53:16.774 --> 02:53:18.755]  It gets the suit thrown out.
[02:53:18.755 --> 02:53:20.375]  That's why my lawyers don't even know what to do.
[02:53:20.375 --> 02:53:29.637]  It's like all misspelled and wrong names and defamation of people that said nothing about Sandy Hook, just wrong reporter's names and Kit Daniels.
[02:53:29.637 --> 02:53:31.417]  We're not even sure at that point.
[02:53:31.417 --> 02:53:34.397]  I guess that's the people they can find to do stuff like this, is lawyers like that.
[02:53:34.397 --> 02:53:37.538]  And then the lawyers are all over defaming me in the news, saying things I didn't say.
[02:53:39.239 --> 02:53:44.843]  And then the lawsuit deals with us saying we get why people have questions because they keep changing their stories.
[02:53:44.843 --> 02:53:48.565]  But I think that's because the media keeps trying to get people to go with talking points.
[02:53:48.565 --> 02:53:49.866]  It doesn't mean the event didn't happen.
[02:53:49.866 --> 02:53:51.427]  It doesn't even mean they're liars.
[02:53:51.427 --> 02:53:53.908]  Maybe it's the way Megyn Kelly changes the interviews.
[02:53:53.908 --> 02:53:57.071]  Because all the parents are saying, we couldn't see our kids for a long time.
[02:53:57.071 --> 02:53:58.131]  We didn't see them that day.
[02:53:58.131 --> 02:54:02.094]  And then we're told, you know, drop the kid off.
[02:54:04.039 --> 02:54:09.101]  He had his book bag, picked him up in a body bag and saw the holes in him and all this that day.
[02:54:09.101 --> 02:54:11.502]  And then maybe that's how Megyn Kelly interviewed him.
[02:54:11.502 --> 02:54:13.302]  Maybe that's how she edited it, but it doesn't matter.
[02:54:13.302 --> 02:54:17.204]  They're betting it all on that because they think you're stupid.
[02:54:17.204 --> 02:54:20.305]  Kind of like the black guy goes into Starbucks and says, I heard you're racist.
[02:54:20.305 --> 02:54:21.365]  Give me a free coffee.
[02:54:21.365 --> 02:54:24.326]  And so she gives it to him because she goes, oh, I kind of heard about that.
[02:54:24.326 --> 02:54:25.147]  Yeah, we're racist.
[02:54:25.147 --> 02:54:25.627]  We're sorry.
[02:54:26.957 --> 02:54:32.181]  And it's just people weren't buying things, weren't wanting to use the bathroom, were staying in the place and got thrown out.
[02:54:32.181 --> 02:54:38.907]  They'll throw a white guy out, they'll throw a black guy out.
[02:54:38.907 --> 02:54:40.608]  And by the way, you can tell it was all staged.
[02:54:40.608 --> 02:54:41.869]  Not that guy, but the guys that got arrested.
[02:54:41.869 --> 02:54:43.311]  They come and say, I want to use the bathroom.
[02:54:43.311 --> 02:54:45.793]  Sorry, it's for, you know, customers.
[02:54:45.793 --> 02:54:46.593]  Can I use the bathroom?
[02:54:46.593 --> 02:54:47.874]  I'm not a customer.
[02:54:47.874 --> 02:54:52.438]  Well, if you asked us to use it, I thought you were a customer, you could, but no, I technically can't because you're saying you're not a customer.
[02:54:52.438 --> 02:54:53.239]  Okay, well, I'm going to sit here.
[02:54:55.595 --> 02:54:57.216]  Trying to like, relive Rosa Parks.
[02:54:57.216 --> 02:55:00.399]  Rosa Parks really got told to ride the back of the bus, and that was horrible.
[02:55:00.399 --> 02:55:03.441]  Blacks really got told they couldn't go in certain hotels or lunch counters.
[02:55:03.441 --> 02:55:04.922]  That's not going on now.
[02:55:04.922 --> 02:55:10.306]  So it's a whole thing by the Justice Department, by the Clintons, by the globalists, to kind of re-kick all this off.
[02:55:10.306 --> 02:55:14.029]  And that's what this all is, is we can't call Alex racist, that doesn't work.
[02:55:14.029 --> 02:55:16.851]  Can't call him a Russian, that thing's falling apart.
[02:55:16.851 --> 02:55:20.654]  We'll just say he's mean to the victims of a mass shooting.
[02:55:20.654 --> 02:55:22.456]  And they said that, you saw them a few months ago about
[02:55:23.422 --> 02:55:26.624]  What happened in Florida, and they tried to get me kicked off the air with that.
[02:55:26.624 --> 02:55:28.085]  Didn't work because it wasn't true.
[02:55:28.085 --> 02:55:33.347]  So they're back again, now recycling what I didn't really say from five years ago.
[02:55:33.347 --> 02:55:35.969]  Because they think you're stupid.
[02:55:35.969 --> 02:55:38.730]  But AP got it right.
[02:55:38.730 --> 02:55:43.313]  They actually quoted me saying, you know, that Jones for years has said he did think it happened.
[02:55:43.313 --> 02:55:47.155]  And that he'd love to have the parents on to discuss and have a real discussion about guns, blah blah blah.
[02:55:48.387 --> 02:55:55.075]  And then it goes into what AP said that the lawyers said, I said, which isn't even in the suit, which isn't even what I did.
[02:55:55.075 --> 02:55:57.478]  So that's what this is, is trying to try me in the court of public opinion.
[02:55:57.478 --> 02:55:59.341]  But here's the deal.
[02:55:59.341 --> 02:56:03.085]  I'm going to go on to the end, as Churchill said, whatever the cost may be.
[02:56:03.085 --> 02:56:05.028]  And we've got record traffic.
[02:56:05.028 --> 02:56:07.070]  We have got people buying a lot of product.
[02:56:07.890 --> 02:56:12.232]  And the way it squares up and looks, we're going to be able to beat these suits, get them thrown out.
[02:56:12.232 --> 02:56:17.274]  We're just having to get a war room together, in-house counsel, so I don't have to worry about it.
[02:56:17.274 --> 02:56:18.255]  And we just move on.
[02:56:18.255 --> 02:56:22.937]  We've got to counter-sue all the people, obviously, for the anti-slapback provisions.
[02:56:22.937 --> 02:56:24.918]  We already filed one of those last week in D.C.
[02:56:24.918 --> 02:56:26.899]  I'm doing what I said I'd do.
[02:56:26.899 --> 02:56:32.341]  Because we've got to let people know when they do these, we've got to hit them back, so that obviously we stop it.
[02:56:32.341 --> 02:56:34.382]  And there's going to be more coming.
[02:56:35.492 --> 02:56:37.433]  And if they can get us, they're going to use it as the precedent.
[02:56:37.433 --> 02:56:43.277]  All these other media cowards that, you know, want to stay out of this, you're going to destroy yourselves by staying out of it.
[02:56:43.277 --> 02:56:49.322]  I want to thank everybody that has stood with us, and I appreciate the audience, Drudge Report, my family, the great crew we've got.
[02:56:49.322 --> 02:56:50.302]  Thank you all.
[02:56:50.302 --> 02:56:50.843]  Speaking of that...
[02:56:51.872 --> 02:56:53.213]  We've got some of the biggest sales ever.
[02:56:53.213 --> 02:56:58.578]  50% off the Real Red Pill, 50% off Alpha Power, even though that sold out in like two weeks.
[02:56:58.578 --> 02:56:59.178]  We've got 25% off X2.
[02:56:59.178 --> 02:57:06.385]  Like I said, we're going to have to stop that sale, but they're going to give us a rush, a medium-sized order.
[02:57:06.385 --> 02:57:08.607]  But the problem is we're running out of this particular supply.
[02:57:09.147 --> 02:57:10.568]  We can't find another one so far.
[02:57:10.568 --> 02:57:13.689]  They're jacking up the prices on us at the mines.
[02:57:13.689 --> 02:57:15.269]  It's done with gas drilling, really.
[02:57:15.269 --> 02:57:15.970]  I say oil drilling.
[02:57:15.970 --> 02:57:16.830]  It's gas drilling.
[02:57:16.830 --> 02:57:19.011]  They get the pure crystals at 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[02:57:19.011 --> 02:57:19.531]  Amazing.
[02:57:19.531 --> 02:57:20.831]  Learn about the iodine experience.
[02:57:20.831 --> 02:57:22.332]  Learn about what pure iodine does.
[02:57:22.332 --> 02:57:25.633]  X2, you can still get it, but not for long, unfortunately.
[02:57:25.633 --> 02:57:27.314]  We may be able to get another supply, but we're trying.
[02:57:27.314 --> 02:57:27.354]  888-253-3139.
[02:57:30.808 --> 02:57:33.211]  We're searching, ever searching for other supplies.
[02:57:33.211 --> 02:57:37.295]  It was them trying to shut us down before with another supply that wasn't even as good that led us to this.
[02:57:37.295 --> 02:57:38.937]  Revolutionized this whole thing.
[02:57:38.937 --> 02:57:40.479]  We'll be back with Roger Stone.
[02:57:40.479 --> 02:57:42.621]  I'm gonna ride shotgun on big issues.
[02:57:42.621 --> 02:57:43.022]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.066 --> 02:57:55.675]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:57:55.675 --> 02:57:57.737]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:57:57.737 --> 02:58:00.599]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:58:00.599 --> 02:58:01.780]  It's made in the USA.
[02:58:02.381 --> 02:58:02.661]  I think?
[02:58:25.782 --> 02:58:37.505]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:58:37.505 --> 02:58:40.806]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:58:40.806 --> 02:58:44.147]  Now it's time to change our bodies, with Z-Field, and fullwarslife.com.
[02:58:45.925 --> 02:58:57.371]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[02:58:57.371 --> 02:59:06.296]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a
[02:59:06.516 --> 02:59:15.243]  Powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in flora life, advanced restoration.
[02:59:15.243 --> 02:59:20.267]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable flora life everyday maintenance.
[02:59:20.267 --> 02:59:30.555]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[02:59:30.555 --> 02:59:35.940]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:49.132]  When you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:59:49.132 --> 02:59:51.775]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.379 --> 03:00:13.243]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.243 --> 03:00:22.206]  I'm gonna ride shotgun for the next 20-30 minutes with Roger Stone, and then he's got all the stuff he's gonna be covering.
[03:00:22.206 --> 03:00:26.888]  But I gotta tell you, we got Rand Paul out saying, looks like Syria was a false flag.
[03:00:26.888 --> 03:00:30.229]  We got Nikki Haley and everybody basically involved in mutiny against the president.
[03:00:31.104 --> 03:00:34.085]  Looks like as soon as John Bolton got in there, things started getting real bad.
[03:00:34.085 --> 03:00:38.106]  Now they've told the rebels, stage another chemical attack, Trump removes Assad.
[03:00:38.106 --> 03:00:43.568]  They've got the president's lawyer raided.
[03:00:43.568 --> 03:00:46.048]  And now all of a sudden, Russiagate's gone.
[03:00:46.048 --> 03:00:51.690]  Now the media's like, we're gonna get you for paying off broads.
[03:00:51.690 --> 03:00:57.732]  But, Comey can cover up all the pedophilia of the Clintons and the Epstein aircraft.
[03:00:57.732 --> 03:00:58.312]  But finally,
[03:00:59.901 --> 03:01:03.746]  GOP demands criminal investigation into Clinton.
[03:01:03.746 --> 03:01:06.690]  Lynch and Comey.
[03:01:06.690 --> 03:01:10.335]  Evidence of conspiracy to overthrow duly elected president surfacing, Congress reports.
[03:01:14.161 --> 03:01:15.442]  That's the action we need.
[03:01:15.442 --> 03:01:22.005]  Representative Matt Gaetz, who I know you've really helped and pushed, are among 11 members of people signing the Declaration of Independence.
[03:01:22.005 --> 03:01:24.166]  Let me tell you, they are signing their death warrant if we don't win.
[03:01:24.166 --> 03:01:25.627]  They've got a lot of courage.
[03:01:25.627 --> 03:01:33.891]  They want an investigation into violations concerning everything from the anti-Trump Steele dossier funding, the handling of Clinton's email probe, the Uranium One scandal.
[03:01:33.891 --> 03:01:35.832]  Everybody else is playing it safe.
[03:01:35.832 --> 03:01:38.733]  We're going to read more of the article in the letter to Congress in the next segment.
[03:01:38.733 --> 03:01:42.515]  This is a short segment, but Roger Stone, I tell you, this sounds like the cavalry
[03:01:42.935 --> 03:01:44.356]  Can we play the cavalry?
[03:01:44.356 --> 03:01:50.402]  Maybe in the next segment, coming in over the hill, maybe John Wayne and the cavalry charge?
[03:01:50.402 --> 03:02:01.151]  Because this feels like the deuce-ex cavalry, or that's the Millennium Falcon coming in in Episode 4, right when Darth Vader's about to kill Skywalker, and just taking those babies out.
[03:02:01.151 --> 03:02:02.612]  I mean, this is what we need, isn't it, Stone?
[03:02:03.493 --> 03:02:05.576]  No, Alex, it's time for the cavalry.
[03:02:05.576 --> 03:02:22.076]  I mean, how long is the cover-up of the egregious crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas and their attempts to actually use the power of the state, the surveillance authority and power and capability of the state, to hijack American presidential election?
[03:02:22.737 --> 03:02:24.378]  And they want to talk about Russia.
[03:02:24.378 --> 03:02:25.919]  Russia, Russia, Russia.
[03:02:25.919 --> 03:02:28.761]  When there's no evidence of collusion or a crime.
[03:02:28.761 --> 03:02:31.203]  When the crime is right under our noses.
[03:02:52.657 --> 03:02:53.938]  What a lunatic!
[03:02:53.938 --> 03:02:58.461]  Yeah, you're speaking, of course, of Judge Kimba Wood, who I know extremely well.
[03:02:58.461 --> 03:03:02.604]  I actually spent a weekend with her socially one time.
[03:03:02.604 --> 03:03:03.424]  Nice lady.
[03:03:03.424 --> 03:03:05.406]  Oh, you know her extremely well?
[03:03:05.406 --> 03:03:07.767]  Well, she is someone I know.
[03:03:07.767 --> 03:03:09.668]  Well, the word is she's kind of wild like you, so...
[03:03:10.969 --> 03:03:19.395]  She's actually been a surprisingly independent jurist and sometimes hands the government decisions that shock them.
[03:03:19.395 --> 03:03:20.616]  So we're back in the sink.
[03:03:20.616 --> 03:03:23.297]  Bolton's good because she drank whiskey with him.
[03:03:23.297 --> 03:03:24.138]  No, I'm not.
[03:03:24.138 --> 03:03:25.799]  And the sheriff's okay because she got him elected.
[03:03:25.799 --> 03:03:27.660]  I'm not mad at you, but now this lady's good.
[03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:29.001]  She used to be a playboy, Bonnie.
[03:03:29.001 --> 03:03:29.722]  She likes to have fun.
[03:03:30.342 --> 03:03:31.983]  Not saying anything of the kind.
[03:03:31.983 --> 03:03:35.885]  She may be in the tank for the Clintons and the Obamas.
[03:03:35.885 --> 03:03:39.747]  Hey, just because she's a rowdy girl that loves life, I'm not putting her down for that.
[03:03:39.747 --> 03:03:44.349]  You know, it's kind of like the famous movie that's a great mirror of reality, Caddyshack.
[03:03:44.349 --> 03:03:46.470]  It's like Lacey has a certain zest for life.
[03:03:46.470 --> 03:03:49.012]  I'm not going to say a word, Judge.
[03:03:49.012 --> 03:03:50.172]  Good.
[03:03:50.172 --> 03:03:51.033]  Very good.
[03:03:51.033 --> 03:03:52.974]  But the issue is her activity.
[03:03:52.974 --> 03:03:53.354]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:03:54.193 --> 03:04:11.124]  Look, I don't know how this comes out, but the new focus on Michael Cohen is clearly built around the fact that he apparently, or at least allegedly, acted to silence a number of women who had extramarital relations with Donald Trump.
[03:04:11.124 --> 03:04:21.731]  Now, the difference between the President and, say, Bill Clinton, is at least those relations were consensual, which you could not say... He wasn't raping a woman and biting her face in a cloakroom.
[03:04:22.435 --> 03:04:30.418]  You know what, at 3% growth in the economy, on the cusp of a peace deal in North Korea, no one cares.
[03:04:30.418 --> 03:04:31.618]  They don't care.
[03:04:31.618 --> 03:04:34.039]  That's why I think the deep state is making a mistake.
[03:04:34.039 --> 03:04:39.741]  I think with Trump and all those Miss America contests, sitting there with the girls, I mean, you can tell what's going on there.
[03:04:39.741 --> 03:04:41.262]  I mean, you know.
[03:04:41.262 --> 03:04:42.742]  The problem is the president's not a pedophile.
[03:04:42.742 --> 03:04:43.942]  If he was, they'd love him.
[03:04:43.942 --> 03:04:44.843]  He's not in the club, folks.
[03:04:45.720 --> 03:04:48.402]  Yeah, he's not in the little kids.
[03:04:48.402 --> 03:04:50.904]  Of course, if you're even in the little girls, that's down to the left.
[03:04:50.904 --> 03:04:51.985]  You've got to be in the little boys.
[03:04:51.985 --> 03:04:52.525]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:52.525 --> 03:04:52.846]  Stay with us.
[03:04:54.065 --> 03:04:57.487]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[03:04:57.487 --> 03:05:01.449]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:05:01.449 --> 03:05:04.791]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:05:04.791 --> 03:05:07.332]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:05:07.332 --> 03:05:12.055]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[03:05:12.055 --> 03:05:14.416]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:05:14.416 --> 03:05:20.820]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:21.420 --> 03:05:29.603]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:29.603 --> 03:05:34.664]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:05:34.664 --> 03:05:41.647]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:05:42.307 --> 03:05:47.211]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[03:05:47.211 --> 03:05:50.073]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:05:50.073 --> 03:05:52.175]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:14.827 --> 03:06:20.692]  Alright, I was jumping all over Stone because it's just an orgy of information, literally and figuratively.
[03:06:20.692 --> 03:06:35.223]  You've got Comey, whoever did the clothing makeover for him, wearing the most gangsterous black shirt with this light gray jacket, like right out of Casino Central casting.
[03:06:35.223 --> 03:06:36.063]  And who was he on with?
[03:06:36.063 --> 03:06:37.144]  Colbert?
[03:06:37.144 --> 03:06:38.145]  I saw a clip this morning.
[03:06:38.145 --> 03:06:38.645]  Who was he on with?
[03:06:38.645 --> 03:06:38.906]  Kimmel?
[03:06:40.592 --> 03:06:48.557]  Guys, Colbert, well let's pull it up on screen, just as a fashion guy, what Roger Stone has to say about him.
[03:06:48.557 --> 03:06:59.143]  But what do you make of Comey, whose whole family voted for the Clintons, who protected the Clintons, who knew he was going to get in trouble for protecting them, reopening the investigation in case Trump won just to fool Trump.
[03:06:59.143 --> 03:07:01.204]  But Comey, I'm not a Republican.
[03:07:01.994 --> 03:07:05.877]  What do you make... I mean, obviously, tell us something we didn't know.
[03:07:05.877 --> 03:07:08.440]  You're also a globalist, you're not a patriot.
[03:07:08.440 --> 03:07:09.861]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:07:09.861 --> 03:07:12.363]  How do they think they're going to get away with it?
[03:07:12.363 --> 03:07:13.824]  And what do you make of this?
[03:07:13.824 --> 03:07:18.628]  And what do you make of the BreakingInfoWars.com story by Jamie White?
[03:07:18.628 --> 03:07:22.212]  Finally, GOP demands criminal investigation into Clinton Lynch and Comey.
[03:07:22.212 --> 03:07:23.613]  We're going to read part of that letter in a moment.
[03:07:24.537 --> 03:07:39.291]  First of all, Alex, I want to remind all the Infowarriors in the greater New York City area that there is a protest today outside the Barnes & Noble in Union Square where Lion Jim Comey has his first book signing.
[03:07:39.291 --> 03:07:47.359]  This is a peaceful protest where we are going to seek to bring public attention to the leaking and lying and illegal acts
[03:07:47.939 --> 03:07:48.879]  Of Jim Comey.
[03:07:48.879 --> 03:07:51.200]  So if you're in the area, come on down.
[03:07:51.200 --> 03:07:54.041]  There's going to be a lot of great InfoWarriors there.
[03:07:54.041 --> 03:07:56.622]  And we look forward to you joining us.
[03:07:56.622 --> 03:07:58.523]  And by the way, let me just add this.
[03:07:58.523 --> 03:08:00.123]  We need to get you in one of these lines.
[03:08:00.123 --> 03:08:01.324]  At least have them throw you out.
[03:08:01.324 --> 03:08:05.905]  But go up there and videotape, you know, your husband with a cell phone beside you.
[03:08:05.905 --> 03:08:08.006]  And go up and say, here I am, buddy.
[03:08:08.006 --> 03:08:11.007]  You're the one with Mueller on tarmacs with uranium.
[03:08:11.007 --> 03:08:12.868]  You're the Russian agent, you piece of filth.
[03:08:14.261 --> 03:08:16.782]  Well, you know, you sound like Laura Loomer.
[03:08:16.782 --> 03:08:19.983]  She wants me to do exactly the same thing.
[03:08:19.983 --> 03:08:20.563]  I'm game.
[03:08:20.563 --> 03:08:26.745]  I'm watching this book tour very carefully, Alex, because I am going to show up at some of them.
[03:08:26.745 --> 03:08:28.626]  Jim Comey needs to be confronted.
[03:08:28.626 --> 03:08:35.489]  I mean, here's a guy who testifies under oath when he's asked, have you ever anonymously leaked information to the media?
[03:08:35.489 --> 03:08:36.149]  He says no.
[03:08:36.849 --> 03:08:48.275]  Then he goes on to say elsewhere that, sure, I gave my notes from my conversation with the president to a friend and had him give them to the New York Times.
[03:08:48.275 --> 03:08:51.336]  So in other words, he leaked and lied about it.
[03:08:51.336 --> 03:09:01.101]  Jim Comey, this is a guy who holds himself up as some kind of epitome or paragon of integrity, and as far as his makeover,
[03:09:01.801 --> 03:09:07.688]  One of Stone's rules, your shirt should never be darker than your tie.
[03:09:07.688 --> 03:09:09.410]  The guy looks like Al Capone.
[03:09:09.410 --> 03:09:11.632]  I mean, what is that all about?
[03:09:11.632 --> 03:09:15.897]  He did the same thing with George Stephanopoulos coming on in an open collar shirt.
[03:09:16.878 --> 03:09:18.439]  No, you're not a regular guy, Jim.
[03:09:18.439 --> 03:09:20.901]  Don't try to convince us that you are.
[03:09:20.901 --> 03:09:22.122]  You're a stiff.
[03:09:22.122 --> 03:09:26.564]  And he's been a legal executioner for both the Clintons and the Bushes.
[03:09:26.564 --> 03:09:28.426]  Of course he's not a Republican.
[03:09:28.426 --> 03:09:30.627]  He's a deep stater, is what he is.
[03:09:30.627 --> 03:09:33.049]  His allegiance is to the deep state.
[03:09:33.049 --> 03:09:36.531]  The deep state, as you know, Alex, knows no party.
[03:09:36.531 --> 03:09:37.752]  It knows no party.
[03:09:42.554 --> 03:09:47.156]  What do you make of this letter that 11 brave members of Congress have sent to Comey?
[03:09:47.156 --> 03:09:49.056]  That's got to certainly scare him.
[03:09:49.056 --> 03:09:56.819]  Yeah, I think, you know, again, kudos to Matt Gates, who I think is a very courageous member of Congress.
[03:09:56.819 --> 03:10:03.481]  As you know, Alex, usually freshmen congressmen, younger congressmen, are expected to be seen and not heard.
[03:10:03.481 --> 03:10:05.482]  Pay your dues to the system.
[03:10:05.482 --> 03:10:06.762]  Don't rock the boat.
[03:10:06.762 --> 03:10:08.223]  Maybe you can climb the ladder.
[03:10:08.803 --> 03:10:25.030]  There's a handful of guys like Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan, others who know why they went to Congress, who went there to make waves, to get something done, to draw attention to the abuses under the Clintons and the Bushes.
[03:10:25.030 --> 03:10:30.112]  So I think this letter is not only a great idea, but it is very good news.
[03:10:30.792 --> 03:10:45.000]  It's time, and you've been saying this now for some weeks, to stop talking defensively about Russia and Stormy Daniels and this nonsense, and talk about the egregious crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas!
[03:10:45.820 --> 03:10:52.543]  This is President Obama who sold weapons to ISIS, or gave them to ISIS, I'm not certain.
[03:10:52.543 --> 03:10:54.444]  And they lied about it.
[03:10:54.444 --> 03:11:00.507]  This is a crook, collectively, who attempted to steal an American presidential election.
[03:11:00.507 --> 03:11:06.070]  And by the way, that's what the letter says from Congress, evidence of conspiracy to overthrow a newly elected president, surfacing.
[03:11:06.070 --> 03:11:07.431]  We've got it in triplicate.
[03:11:07.431 --> 03:11:09.392]  I want to get back to that just briefly.
[03:11:09.392 --> 03:11:10.793]  Number one story on Yahoo.
[03:11:11.935 --> 03:11:15.474]  Twitter, Facebook, Alex Jones says no kids died at Sandy Hook.
[03:11:16.243 --> 03:11:18.445]  When for years I've said I believe they die.
[03:11:18.445 --> 03:11:20.326]  The lawsuit says I just said that.
[03:11:20.326 --> 03:11:21.567]  I haven't said that.
[03:11:21.567 --> 03:11:27.652]  Years ago I played devil's advocate in debates and said I could see how in the government lied about babies and incubators and you know all the rest of it.
[03:11:27.652 --> 03:11:30.474]  That people could say they're lying and I could see that.
[03:11:30.474 --> 03:11:31.915]  But I don't think that in this.
[03:11:31.915 --> 03:11:39.441]  The media is in a hoax saying I've said this and then now they've sued me when it's going to come out in court what's going on.
[03:11:39.441 --> 03:11:44.705]  You can go back five years ago when I was kind of entertaining it but there's a statute of limitations to a year
[03:11:45.646 --> 03:11:50.715]  I've not said that even ever, but I mean, they are really afraid of InfoWars.
[03:11:50.715 --> 03:11:51.857]  They are apoplectic.
[03:11:51.857 --> 03:11:53.961]  They have gone into crazy town mode.
[03:11:54.986 --> 03:12:23.155]  Now look, Alex, I'm surprised when they go out there and they distort the things that I say, but the treatment you've gotten over the last 60 days with this series of orchestrated, phony, baseless, outrageous, but expensive lawsuits is clearly a coordinated effort to silence you and to give the internet mavens the rationale for taking away your voice.
[03:12:23.835 --> 03:12:24.235]  The whole thing.
[03:12:44.645 --> 03:12:47.066]  When the guy was on 60 Minutes saying it.
[03:12:47.066 --> 03:12:48.947]  I mean, he said it was the best time of his life.
[03:12:48.947 --> 03:12:49.968]  He'd do it again.
[03:12:49.968 --> 03:12:51.949]  He worked for Hitler.
[03:12:51.949 --> 03:12:53.330]  Soros is so pissed.
[03:12:53.330 --> 03:12:55.831]  They even put it in the lawsuits, his messages to me.
[03:12:55.831 --> 03:13:02.795]  Jones also claims, it's in the Georgetown lawsuit, that Soros is a Nazi collaborator.
[03:13:02.795 --> 03:13:08.618]  So they're even letting me know, we're suing you, and the left worships this Nazi collaborator.
[03:13:08.618 --> 03:13:08.878]  Why?
[03:13:10.069 --> 03:13:20.119]  Well, actually, in that same interview, remember, Alex, he said, look, if I didn't do it, meaning pointing out Jews to be grabbed by the Nazis, if I didn't do it, somebody else would.
[03:13:20.119 --> 03:13:24.143]  Look, he can be defeated with his own words.
[03:13:24.143 --> 03:13:27.467]  Well, exactly, but the sociopath doesn't even know how crazy that sounds.
[03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:35.505]  Well, and the fact that it pops up in multiple lawsuits shows you the coordinated attempt to take down InfoWars.
[03:13:35.505 --> 03:13:37.706]  That's what this is really about.
[03:13:37.706 --> 03:13:43.210]  Alex Jones could not have made it clearer that he believes people died at Sandy Hook.
[03:13:43.210 --> 03:13:56.799]  It is a smear, it's a falsehood to say otherwise, whether you're saying it in a lawsuit or saying it in an interview, but it's a club that they think they can use to bludgeon you and to bludgeon InfoWars into silence.
[03:13:56.799 --> 03:13:57.760]  Not going to happen.
[03:13:58.280 --> 03:14:04.022]  But I know firsthand the incredible cost of defending in these lawsuits.
[03:14:04.022 --> 03:14:08.864]  You're looking at hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe millions, before this is over.
[03:14:08.864 --> 03:14:11.625]  And people say, oh my God, you're so upholding mobile, you can pay for it.
[03:14:11.625 --> 03:14:17.147]  No, I didn't get the former wide-body jet for $50 million, Glenn Beck's having to sell.
[03:14:17.147 --> 03:14:19.748]  I mean, I live in a nice house, but it's modest.
[03:14:19.748 --> 03:14:21.408]  I drive, you know, American cars are $50,000.
[03:14:21.408 --> 03:14:23.769]  I got a truck that's $60,000.
[03:14:23.769 --> 03:14:24.789]  I like it, it's a big truck.
[03:14:26.730 --> 03:14:27.390]  That's it.
[03:14:27.390 --> 03:14:30.691]  I mean, I'm not, I got, I started, I got one nice watch.
[03:14:30.691 --> 03:14:32.412]  I had like 15 people give me nice watches.
[03:14:32.412 --> 03:14:34.412]  So as gifts, I got a lot of nice watches.
[03:14:34.412 --> 03:14:40.114]  But other than that, I mean, I'm not into things and that's the reality.
[03:14:40.114 --> 03:14:42.135]  And so they really can't take anything away from me.
[03:14:42.135 --> 03:14:46.176]  So I'm just, it's a good thing though, that we've put money back and done things for just this.
[03:14:46.176 --> 03:14:52.038]  So now we can fight this for a long time, but I'm worried, Roger, when they don't shut us down, I think they're going to send a hit team.
[03:14:52.338 --> 03:14:53.660]  And you know, that's okay.
[03:14:53.660 --> 03:14:55.422]  It's just, the people need to know how real this is.
[03:14:55.422 --> 03:14:59.147]  Because I think they're assassinating my character ahead of killing me like they tried to kill you.
[03:15:00.233 --> 03:15:10.163]  Well, the good news is you are well-guarded and my guess is you're probably packing yourself, so they'd be making a big mistake to call you out.
[03:15:10.163 --> 03:15:11.184]  No, there's no question.
[03:15:11.184 --> 03:15:13.907]  Infowars drives them completely crazy.
[03:15:13.907 --> 03:15:14.227]  Why?
[03:15:14.227 --> 03:15:22.676]  Because we're the tip of the spear, because we are the cutting edge, and we go right to expose them utilizing the facts, and they hate that more
[03:15:22.836 --> 03:15:24.117]  Than anything else.
[03:15:24.117 --> 03:15:35.104]  Folks need to go to the Infowars store now and find that donate button because I can tell you, these lawsuits are ridiculously expensive, but they must be fought and they must be won.
[03:15:35.104 --> 03:15:36.865]  This is all an attack on you folks.
[03:15:36.865 --> 03:15:42.068]  Rogers had Obama set a law firm up just to sue Roger and the President.
[03:15:42.068 --> 03:15:43.349]  They're in the same lawsuit.
[03:15:43.349 --> 03:15:43.990]  I mean, this is it.
[03:15:43.990 --> 03:15:45.210]  And then they think you're going to roll over.
[03:15:45.210 --> 03:15:47.132]  They think you don't get how un-American this is.
[03:15:47.132 --> 03:15:48.092]  We're going to win.
[03:15:48.092 --> 03:15:52.195]  I want to get more to this letter when we come back and ask what the next shoe to drop is with Roger Stone.
[03:15:53.368 --> 03:15:55.170]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[03:15:55.170 --> 03:16:03.777]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[03:16:36.090 --> 03:16:37.671]  NASA PAC Technology.
[03:16:37.671 --> 03:16:38.271]  Bacon.

[03:16:42.433 --> 03:16:43.873]  Or warm and served.

[03:16:52.972 --> 03:16:54.933]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:16:54.933 --> 03:17:00.257]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:17:00.257 --> 03:17:01.839]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:17:01.839 --> 03:17:10.185]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:17:10.185 --> 03:17:15.889]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:17:16.049 --> 03:17:17.871]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:17:17.871 --> 03:17:20.153]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:17:20.153 --> 03:17:24.537]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:17:24.537 --> 03:17:26.740]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:17:26.740 --> 03:17:34.487]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[03:17:35.128 --> 03:17:35.388]  We're good.
[03:17:54.747 --> 03:17:55.528]  I'm so excited.
[03:17:55.528 --> 03:18:05.674]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:18:05.674 --> 03:18:14.200]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:22.986]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:18:25.067 --> 03:18:35.313]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:18:35.313 --> 03:18:44.658]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:18:44.658 --> 03:18:47.339]  It is amazing!
[03:18:47.339 --> 03:18:52.302]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:18:55.379 --> 03:19:03.921]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.
[03:19:03.921 --> 03:19:07.422]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.
[03:19:07.422 --> 03:19:16.945]  to create the strongest, most concentrated, over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[03:19:16.945 --> 03:19:23.347]  I know from using this myself the last few months, and from seeing my friends and family use it, that this new product is going to end up being
[03:19:23.627 --> 03:19:24.628]  We're good to go.
[03:19:56.647 --> 03:19:59.235]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.835 --> 03:20:31.419]  Man, I just saw one of the coolest rifles during the break.
[03:20:31.419 --> 03:20:33.740]  Really sexy, looking like Marilyn Monroe or something.
[03:20:33.740 --> 03:20:35.181]  300 blackout.
[03:20:35.181 --> 03:20:38.663]  Fully suppressed.
[03:20:38.663 --> 03:20:40.204]  We're going back to Roger Stone.
[03:20:40.204 --> 03:20:43.206]  Roger, taking over at the bottom of the hour.
[03:20:43.206 --> 03:20:48.069]  This is such an exciting historical time, and I see a lot of Americans are somewhat awake.
[03:20:48.069 --> 03:20:49.790]  Our audience is white-hot awake.
[03:20:49.790 --> 03:20:51.231]  That's why the globalists hate it.
[03:20:53.871 --> 03:20:58.435]  The left is just in a wound-up, craved, maniac mode.
[03:20:58.435 --> 03:21:00.336]  Comey doesn't see how dumb he looks.
[03:21:00.336 --> 03:21:02.138]  Mueller doesn't know how dumb he looks.
[03:21:02.138 --> 03:21:05.540]  Hillary won't go away.
[03:21:05.540 --> 03:21:07.522]  It's just an incredible time.
[03:21:07.522 --> 03:21:14.928]  You've got a lot to cover here, but... When does the left hit rock bottom?
[03:21:14.928 --> 03:21:17.630]  When do they stop getting so violent and aggressive?
[03:21:17.630 --> 03:21:19.231]  Or is there no bottom to these people?
[03:21:19.231 --> 03:21:20.452]  Or is there no top to these people?
[03:21:21.906 --> 03:21:23.768]  Well, they'll just never give up.
[03:21:23.768 --> 03:21:26.390]  They refused to concede the last election.
[03:21:26.390 --> 03:21:39.002]  It is such a shock to their system that the country elected a reformer, an outsider, who doesn't kowtow entirely to their globalist agenda, that they seek to remove him.
[03:21:39.002 --> 03:21:41.524]  I think what we have here is two things going on at once.
[03:21:42.205 --> 03:21:50.927]  First of all, reaction to the fact that they've spent millions on the whole notion of Russian collusion and come up completely empty-handed.
[03:21:50.927 --> 03:21:53.528]  Can't remove Donald Trump for that.
[03:21:53.528 --> 03:22:08.712]  Then when he tweeted a few short days ago that it was time to get all of our troops out of Syria, it merely underlined for them their need to remove this president who isn't committed to... And that's my next two questions.
[03:22:09.272 --> 03:22:09.512]  Yep.
[03:22:09.512 --> 03:22:11.014]  He comes out and says we're going to get out.
[03:22:11.014 --> 03:22:11.875]  Mission accomplished.
[03:22:11.875 --> 03:22:13.577]  And then this staged false flag happened.
[03:22:13.577 --> 03:22:14.999]  Totally obvious.
[03:22:14.999 --> 03:22:16.681]  You know, the rebels have been caught before.
[03:22:16.681 --> 03:22:17.422]  They have the motive.
[03:22:17.422 --> 03:22:18.763]  Assad doesn't have the motive.
[03:22:18.763 --> 03:22:19.344]  On and on and on.
[03:22:19.344 --> 03:22:20.986]  Now Haley is bucking him.
[03:22:20.986 --> 03:22:26.052]  Civil War A. It shows he's going against Sessions because Trump was always for decriminalization of marijuana.
[03:22:26.052 --> 03:22:28.455]  That'll totally get his approval rating way up, which it's already done.
[03:22:28.775 --> 03:22:32.477]  It'll totally get mainline people that are reasonable to go, wow, Obama wouldn't do that.
[03:22:32.477 --> 03:22:33.438]  You're going to do that.
[03:22:33.438 --> 03:22:39.301]  That shows he's reigning in sessions that believes in reefer madness and wants you to put you in jail for 10 years for a marijuana cigarette.
[03:22:39.301 --> 03:22:40.882]  Trump announced that last week.
[03:22:40.882 --> 03:22:44.264]  No coverage that he said we're going to end the war on marijuana.
[03:22:44.264 --> 03:22:48.946]  I mean, that is that's something you personally have hammered him on to keep his promise.
[03:22:48.946 --> 03:22:50.007]  But that got no coverage.
[03:22:50.527 --> 03:22:51.508]  It's amazing, isn't it?
[03:22:51.508 --> 03:23:11.628]  Look, I announced six months ago that I was undertaking an effort, organizing something called the United States Cannabis Coalition, a coalition of both Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, to lobby the President not to crack down on state-legalized medicinal marijuana in the 29 states that have approved it.
[03:23:12.208 --> 03:23:16.289]  The President has now done exactly what we've been asking him to do.
[03:23:16.289 --> 03:23:18.269]  He should be lauded for this.
[03:23:18.269 --> 03:23:21.010]  Instead, it receives scant coverage.
[03:23:21.010 --> 03:23:25.551]  The one guy I think it is driving crazy is Crazy Jeff Sessions.
[03:23:25.551 --> 03:23:27.631]  But you're absolutely right.
[03:23:27.631 --> 03:23:37.293]  Only you, Alex, and Tucker Carlson, the only two major national figures to speak out against this insanity in Syria,
[03:23:38.213 --> 03:23:48.198]  In which I think the deep staters, the neocons, the war hawks, once again use the exact same dirty trick that they used months ago.
[03:23:48.198 --> 03:23:54.962]  The phony gas attack, which mark my words, we will learn shortly, they can't prove yet again.
[03:23:54.962 --> 03:23:55.342]  How many times?
[03:23:55.342 --> 03:24:01.505]  Exactly, but Trump knows this, he's tweeted this, the rebels have been caught three times, Rand Paul's saying it, the military sources are saying it.
[03:24:02.125 --> 03:24:06.230]  And then now Trump, by striking, has said, if you do it again, I'll really take you out.
[03:24:06.230 --> 03:24:07.872]  Well, now the rebels are going to do it for sure!
[03:24:09.312 --> 03:24:16.775]  Well, and we can't also pretend that this whole thing has no domestic political impact.
[03:24:16.775 --> 03:24:27.439]  Very, very hard for those on the left to say Donald Trump is in bed with Putin if he's kicking the crap out of the Syrians who are aligned with Russia.
[03:24:27.439 --> 03:24:33.581]  So, I have to admit that the political implications of it... But it's still a cheap trick.
[03:24:34.674 --> 03:24:44.881]  It's a ridiculously cheap trick, and more importantly, I want to see if our military actions have any real impact on what's going on in Syria or not.
[03:24:44.881 --> 03:24:49.964]  That surgical strike on the airbase only months ago had no impact at all.
[03:24:49.964 --> 03:24:52.046]  The very next day, the airbase was open for business.
[03:24:52.046 --> 03:25:04.094]  Well, I know behind the scenes the Russians were told, and they said, sure, save face, and it's about North Korea too, but the fact that the neocons are openly and haily, you can hardly form sentences, and not that she's a woman, she's just a buffoon, she sits around going,
[03:25:05.496 --> 03:25:08.578]  And you'll thank God Matt has reportedly tried to put the brakes on this.
[03:25:08.578 --> 03:25:14.681]  I mean, it's just insane that now we have these bumbling buffoons trying to start World War III.
[03:25:15.933 --> 03:25:20.954]  Well, and look, the real reason, the only reason Nikki Haley is at the U.N.
[03:25:20.954 --> 03:25:29.997]  was because Donald Trump wanted to get her out of South Carolina, where she did not support his candidacy, to elevate the Lieutenant Governor, Henry McMaster, a good man.
[03:25:29.997 --> 03:25:34.539]  But I was about to say, she was a leading never-Trumper, showing your political awareness.
[03:25:34.539 --> 03:25:36.179]  Here's the information right here.
[03:25:36.179 --> 03:25:37.779]  Get the damn never-Trumpers out.
[03:25:37.779 --> 03:25:38.840]  Something he was saying day one.
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:46.530]  Well, and you can hear Trump actually saying, well we gotta find some job for Nikki Haley, let's send her someplace that doesn't matter.
[03:25:46.530 --> 03:25:48.894]  I've got a great idea, how about the UN?
[03:25:48.894 --> 03:25:51.097]  Nothing ever happens there that matters.
[03:25:51.892 --> 03:25:54.694]  Well, I mean, how is she going to put up with her and her power trip?
[03:25:54.694 --> 03:25:57.076]  I mean, just the way she stomps around.
[03:25:57.076 --> 03:25:59.417]  And I'm so sick of these people.
[03:25:59.417 --> 03:26:01.398]  Alex, she thinks she's running for president.
[03:26:01.398 --> 03:26:03.860]  Make no mistake about it.
[03:26:03.860 --> 03:26:07.983]  She should have been defeated when she ran for governor in South Carolina.
[03:26:07.983 --> 03:26:10.965]  There's more than enough on her to blow her away.
[03:26:10.965 --> 03:26:14.908]  Had I been running that campaign, you would never have heard of her again.
[03:26:14.908 --> 03:26:17.629]  So please step up, Nikki, step up.
[03:26:17.629 --> 03:26:19.170]  We'd love to talk about this guy walking around.
[03:26:20.111 --> 03:26:20.611]  Yeah, that is bizarre.
[03:26:20.611 --> 03:26:21.312]  Who is that guy?
[03:26:21.312 --> 03:26:22.413]  That would be interesting to know.
[03:26:22.413 --> 03:26:23.734]  Here, I'll make his face.
[03:26:23.734 --> 03:26:24.655]  That, folks, is the face of elitism.
[03:26:24.655 --> 03:26:25.436]  There it is right there.
[03:26:46.684 --> 03:26:53.588]  Can you imagine, like, on a delusional power trip, where you just strut around, like, look at people like this, like, I'm powerful.
[03:26:53.588 --> 03:26:55.169]  You see how powerful I am, right?
[03:26:55.169 --> 03:27:04.934]  You know, one thing I can say for sure, when you and I invaded the swamp in Washington last week, we never looked like that.
[03:27:04.934 --> 03:27:07.975]  We had a good time, but we never looked like that.
[03:27:07.975 --> 03:27:10.317]  Well, no, imagine trying to walk around like you're powerful.
[03:27:10.317 --> 03:27:10.857]  It's ridiculous.
[03:27:12.728 --> 03:27:16.109]  Yeah, but it's also part of the game in Washington.
[03:27:16.109 --> 03:27:21.731]  It's all about, you know, you don't place your own phone calls, you have someone else place your phone call.
[03:27:21.731 --> 03:27:23.912]  Please hold for one moment for Alex Jones.
[03:27:23.912 --> 03:27:26.933]  No, it's not done that way.
[03:27:26.933 --> 03:27:27.973]  It's very pretentious.
[03:27:27.973 --> 03:27:29.734]  Tell us what's coming up in the next segment.
[03:27:30.831 --> 03:27:40.857]  Well, I want to focus more on what Matt Gaetz and the Band of Eleven are up to, because I think this is the new crucial move.
[03:27:40.857 --> 03:27:44.058]  You've been saying this for some weeks, you're absolutely right.
[03:27:44.058 --> 03:27:49.441]  It's essential for the forces of freedom to get on the offense and get off defense.
[03:27:49.441 --> 03:27:59.487]  Enough talking about Russia, enough talking about the mountain of disinformation regarding WikiLeaks and Julian Assange and Michael Cohen and Stormy Dick.
[03:27:59.947 --> 03:28:02.127]  All of that is a distraction.
[03:28:02.127 --> 03:28:03.628]  Bill and Hillary.
[03:28:03.628 --> 03:28:05.068]  Barack Obama.
[03:28:05.068 --> 03:28:06.908]  Caught red-handed.
[03:28:06.908 --> 03:28:08.349]  Breaking the law.
[03:28:08.349 --> 03:28:11.249]  Serious jail time felonies.
[03:28:11.249 --> 03:28:22.272]  When are we going to get an Attorney General and a Justice Department committed to the rule of law and committed to prosecuting the egregious crimes of these criminals?
[03:28:22.272 --> 03:28:28.473]  We'll be taking calls in the next segment as well because I find a lot of InfoWarriors want to talk about that.
[03:28:28.573 --> 03:28:30.094]  That's right.
[03:28:30.094 --> 03:28:32.136]  877-789-2539 to talk to Roger Stone.
[03:28:32.136 --> 03:28:32.196]  877-789-2539.
[03:28:32.196 --> 03:28:38.921]  I'm going to punch you out here and take care of business, shoot some live reports and gear up for some other operations.
[03:28:38.921 --> 03:28:42.264]  Big breaking news, of course, War Room coming up that Roger will be part of as well.
[03:28:42.264 --> 03:28:46.287]  Co-hosting at 3 o'clock central in 32 minutes from now.
[03:28:46.287 --> 03:28:46.648]  Stay tuned.
[03:28:53.007 --> 03:28:53.907]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:28:53.907 --> 03:28:56.309]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[03:28:56.309 --> 03:29:04.432]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[03:29:04.432 --> 03:29:06.373]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[03:29:06.373 --> 03:29:10.075]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.

[03:29:23.160 --> 03:29:25.041]  Healthcare reform is confusing.
[03:29:25.041 --> 03:29:33.644]  But whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[03:29:54.008 --> 03:30:14.023]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:30:14.023 --> 03:30:16.104]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[03:30:56.732 --> 03:30:58.153]  Let's go to Devin in Florida.
[03:30:58.153 --> 03:31:00.375]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:31:00.375 --> 03:31:01.976]  Great, hey, thank you so much.
[03:31:01.976 --> 03:31:06.540]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:31:06.540 --> 03:31:08.201]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[03:31:08.201 --> 03:31:15.787]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:31:15.787 --> 03:31:16.548]  Wow, thank you.
[03:31:16.548 --> 03:31:19.030]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[03:31:19.030 --> 03:31:20.571]  Which super surgical does he like best?
[03:31:20.811 --> 03:31:24.294]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:31:24.294 --> 03:31:25.576]  That's really incredible.
[03:31:25.576 --> 03:31:28.619]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:31:28.619 --> 03:31:31.641]  Like, I haven't felt... My morning was fantastic.
[03:31:31.641 --> 03:31:35.045]  And I love you guys, I love the InfoWars crew.
[03:31:35.045 --> 03:31:42.952]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it, you will love it.

[03:32:57.566 --> 03:33:13.312]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.312 --> 03:33:20.134]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:33:20.134 --> 03:33:22.976]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:33:22.976 --> 03:33:24.056]  And now, Roger Stone.
[03:33:29.380 --> 03:33:31.041]  All right, welcome back.
[03:33:31.041 --> 03:33:36.603]  I'm Roger Stone, now in the chair in the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.603 --> 03:33:42.265]  Don't forget to join us at the War Room immediately after the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:42.265 --> 03:33:53.509]  Well, there seems to be some coverage in the media today of the fact that I was overheard in a New York restaurant saying that Barbara Bush drank so much booze
[03:33:54.289 --> 03:33:59.532]  That if they had cremated her, her body would have burned for three days.
[03:33:59.532 --> 03:34:05.096]  Trust me, Barbara Bush made Betty Ford look like Carrie Nation.
[03:34:05.096 --> 03:34:11.020]  She was a very mean, vindictive, and entitled person.
[03:34:11.020 --> 03:34:20.166]  And I assure you, after Ronald Reagan defeated her husband, George Bush, in the New York and New Jersey primaries in 1980, and drew to a standstill,
[03:34:24.048 --> 03:34:28.669]  In Connecticut, well, she said much worse things about me.
[03:34:28.669 --> 03:34:29.350]  Let me stop you.
[03:34:29.350 --> 03:34:31.090]  I was going to go, but I was here eating my lunch.
[03:34:31.090 --> 03:34:33.431]  I wanted to watch you and enjoy myself.
[03:34:33.431 --> 03:34:35.472]  But I just remember reading the history books about it.
[03:34:35.472 --> 03:34:39.573]  Nancy Reagan hated her, absolutely said she was a demon.
[03:34:39.573 --> 03:34:40.733]  And so the media is all lying.
[03:34:40.733 --> 03:34:44.414]  I was like, I don't want to speak ill of the dead, but I just didn't cover it.
[03:34:44.414 --> 03:34:49.716]  But then she famously went on Larry King Live and said, if you talk bad about my family, I will kill you.
[03:34:50.336 --> 03:34:51.779]  And Larry King said, what does that mean?
[03:34:51.779 --> 03:34:53.723]  She goes, I will kill you.
[03:34:53.723 --> 03:34:55.987]  So is she really the first female president?
[03:34:57.315 --> 03:35:13.226]  Well, and not only that, but you may remember, Alex, that she was well enough to travel to New Hampshire to campaign for Jeb for president, but only days later she was too sick to attend the funeral of Nancy Reagan.
[03:35:13.226 --> 03:35:18.890]  Nancy Reagan married to the man who revived George H.W.
[03:35:18.890 --> 03:35:19.651]  Bush's career.
[03:35:21.232 --> 03:35:22.653]  Ran against Reagan.
[03:35:22.653 --> 03:35:25.995]  Reagan said he was a globalist, new world order, trilateralist.
[03:35:25.995 --> 03:35:31.338]  At the famous convention, as you know, they made him take him or said, we'll basically take you out.
[03:35:31.338 --> 03:35:32.638]  Then Bush Jr.
[03:35:32.638 --> 03:35:36.220]  was hanging around, obviously, with Hinckley.
[03:35:36.220 --> 03:35:38.962]  And the brother was that then shot Reagan.
[03:35:38.962 --> 03:35:39.782]  Absolutely.
[03:35:39.782 --> 03:35:42.624]  Tell folks what Nancy Reagan thought about what happened to her husband.
[03:35:43.445 --> 03:35:48.690]  Nancy Reagan believed that the Bushes were involved in the attempt on her husband's life.
[03:35:48.690 --> 03:35:53.776]  Anyone who'd like to read more about this, get my book, The Bush Crime Family.
[03:35:53.776 --> 03:36:02.806]  There's an entire chapter on the attempted assassination of one of our greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan, and the Bush family's various ties
[03:36:03.306 --> 03:36:10.090]  Not just through one of the Bush sons to Hinckley, but various other ties to that assassination.
[03:36:10.090 --> 03:36:14.652]  As soon as Reagan is shot, it is assumed that he's been hit and he's going to die.
[03:36:14.652 --> 03:36:22.617]  The Bush people try to grab the nuclear football immediately, and oddly enough, they are repelled by Al Haig.
[03:36:22.617 --> 03:36:24.978]  Al Haig had no great love for the Bushes.
[03:36:24.978 --> 03:36:27.399]  And the media spun it that Haig was trying to be a dictator.
[03:36:27.399 --> 03:36:31.842]  No, he came out in a press conference and said, I'm in charge, I'm in charge, not the Bushes, the President's okay.
[03:36:33.059 --> 03:36:34.300]  Exactly.
[03:36:34.300 --> 03:36:42.082]  That whole thing has been badly bastardized, and if you look at Haig's comments within context, he didn't say anything wrong.
[03:36:42.082 --> 03:36:51.125]  But there's an immediate attempt by James Baker III and the Bush people to destroy Al Haig because he stands in the way of their grabbing the power.
[03:36:51.745 --> 03:36:52.786]  George H.W.
[03:36:52.786 --> 03:36:56.070]  Bush is still alive and he's still a criminal.
[03:36:56.070 --> 03:36:59.633]  You can get my book, The Bush Crime Family, lays it all out.
[03:36:59.633 --> 03:37:05.299]  Rest in peace, Barbara Bush, but let there be no mistake, she was not a great or nice person.
[03:37:05.299 --> 03:37:08.022]  Well let's be clear, I held my tongue, but since you're doing it, I'll do it.
[03:37:09.036 --> 03:37:13.339]  They were the main family, Prescott Bush, that was the main Nazi lawyer.
[03:37:13.339 --> 03:37:20.964]  And then all that money that went to Texas, and went to Central and South America, and their big command bases, and a bunch of the Nazis came over.
[03:37:20.964 --> 03:37:23.186]  And that's why the Bushes got so powerful.
[03:37:23.186 --> 03:37:27.709]  It's why as the money man for his dad, they put him as the head of the CIA.
[03:37:27.709 --> 03:37:30.510]  He never worked for the CIA, except back when he helped kill Kennedy.
[03:37:30.510 --> 03:37:32.672]  That all came out in federal documents, as you know.
[03:37:32.672 --> 03:37:34.013]  So he lied about that.
[03:37:34.013 --> 03:37:36.274]  And the thing is, women and children are not in the fight.
[03:37:36.274 --> 03:37:38.055]  I don't put mine in it, but she
[03:37:39.196 --> 03:37:40.957]  As they brag, oh, she's just a first lady.
[03:37:40.957 --> 03:37:41.437]  No.
[03:37:41.437 --> 03:37:50.139]  From my research, Barbara and her whole family of folks are really some mean people and tough as nails as well.
[03:37:50.139 --> 03:37:52.020]  Well, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[03:37:52.020 --> 03:37:56.981]  Prescott Bush was, of course, the main financier of the Nazi war machine.
[03:37:56.981 --> 03:38:02.382]  This is how Hitler paid for his munitions and financed his war effort.
[03:38:02.382 --> 03:38:04.783]  And almost got arrested by the McCormick-Dickstein Committee.
[03:38:04.783 --> 03:38:07.984]  I mean, all this was in the news back then, but it got swept under the rug.
[03:38:08.664 --> 03:38:12.087]  Well, and as you know, they seized his bank.
[03:38:12.087 --> 03:38:18.913]  Had he not been well-connected and a bonesman, he probably would have been tried for treason.
[03:38:18.913 --> 03:38:27.140]  The entire story of the Bushes, whether it is Prescott Bush's financing of the Nazis, George H.W.
[03:38:27.140 --> 03:38:36.868]  Bush's trafficking of cocaine to pay for the illegal war in Nicaragua, or Jeb Bush's acting as a drug dealer in Miami, it's all in my book.
[03:38:37.268 --> 03:38:41.830]  This is a criminal cabal, the Bush family.
[03:38:41.830 --> 03:38:49.894]  And watching the media lionize Barbara Bush today, who was a mean-spirited, nasty drunk, is a bit more than I can stand.
[03:38:49.894 --> 03:38:51.215]  Well, my God.
[03:38:51.215 --> 03:38:55.777]  I mean, she looked in 1990, I was watching speeches, like she was 90 years old.
[03:38:55.777 --> 03:38:58.838]  And I gotta give it to her, she's tough, though.
[03:38:58.838 --> 03:39:02.120]  I'm told she drank more than Winston Churchill, who they thought was the greatest drunk ever.
[03:39:02.120 --> 03:39:03.761]  What did she mainly imbibe in?
[03:39:04.341 --> 03:39:11.605]  She was hitting the screwdrivers around nine o'clock every morning, and she was loaded by lunch.
[03:39:11.605 --> 03:39:15.187]  What's ironic, and I reveal this in the book, George H.W.
[03:39:15.187 --> 03:39:20.770]  Bush had a long-time mistress by the name of Jennifer Fitzgerald.
[03:39:20.770 --> 03:39:24.272]  And Alex, she was no better looking than Barbara Bush.
[03:39:24.272 --> 03:39:25.733]  What's with that?
[03:39:25.733 --> 03:39:27.114]  What does that mean psychologically?
[03:39:27.114 --> 03:39:28.254]  Because we're not being mean here.
[03:39:28.254 --> 03:39:30.676]  You know, it was Charlottesville Great Patriot.
[03:39:31.656 --> 03:39:36.220]  Whose dad was a skull and bones that leaked it to her before he died of cancer.
[03:39:36.220 --> 03:39:39.563]  And she gave it to Anthony Sutton, the congressional investigator.
[03:39:39.563 --> 03:39:46.488]  And all of them aren't bad, but you know, they get in feces, they worship Lucifer, they pee on each other, they get in coffins and are reborn.
[03:39:46.488 --> 03:39:53.494]  You know, you watch The Good Shepherd, directed by Robert De Niro, starring Matt Damon, that goes through some of that.
[03:39:53.494 --> 03:39:54.075]  I mean, that's real.
[03:39:55.896 --> 03:40:00.939]  Why don't fraternities have a couple drinks and hang out with some nice ladies or have a campfire?
[03:40:00.939 --> 03:40:06.083]  What is it about these elites that they want to swim around in human feces and get in coffins?
[03:40:06.083 --> 03:40:08.925]  I'm not going to get into what they do.
[03:40:08.925 --> 03:40:10.866]  It just shows these are not normal people.
[03:40:11.621 --> 03:40:15.402]  No, it's high wasp elitist style.
[03:40:15.402 --> 03:40:19.443]  You see the same thing in the upper classes in Europe.
[03:40:19.443 --> 03:40:22.403]  A great prevalence of pedophilia.
[03:40:22.403 --> 03:40:25.364]  Some instance of that in the case of George H.W.
[03:40:25.364 --> 03:40:26.024]  Bush.
[03:40:26.024 --> 03:40:28.625]  Again, I refer you to my book.
[03:40:28.625 --> 03:40:30.685]  Let's go ahead and risk our lives big time here.
[03:40:30.685 --> 03:40:33.606]  Go ahead and get into it because I talked to a police detective
[03:40:34.446 --> 03:40:47.437]  Fifteen, sixteen years ago, who was, documented who he was, and he told me about privately investigating the Bushes in Houston, and he later, about two years later, died in a hit-and-run T-bone accident.
[03:40:47.437 --> 03:40:48.538]  I'm sure it was no big deal.
[03:40:48.538 --> 03:40:51.320]  But I didn't go with it, it was so fantastical, and he couldn't prove it.
[03:40:51.320 --> 03:41:01.208]  He said investigating them, he was following them once, after he wasn't president, and that they went to this big church on the outskirts of Houston, north of it, and they go in there,
[03:41:02.443 --> 03:41:11.732]  And so he came back about a week later and was able to get in when a janitor was in there and that it was baby blue flags with huge swastikas on it.
[03:41:11.732 --> 03:41:14.935]  And he said to the weird old guy that was there, he said, what is this?
[03:41:14.935 --> 03:41:17.877]  He said, this is the true church of God.
[03:41:17.877 --> 03:41:21.661]  So, and then I talked to a guy I knew in college and I'm not going to get into the whole details.
[03:41:21.661 --> 03:41:22.662]  And he thought George H.W.
[03:41:22.662 --> 03:41:26.125]  was a great guy, but I'm not even going to go there.
[03:41:26.125 --> 03:41:27.106]  But finish your point.
[03:41:27.106 --> 03:41:27.426]  I'm sorry.
[03:41:27.426 --> 03:41:28.207]  This is just too insane.
[03:41:28.610 --> 03:41:30.592]  No, Alex, I think you're making a good point.
[03:41:30.592 --> 03:41:32.234]  The thing about George H.W.
[03:41:32.234 --> 03:41:39.240]  Bush is he had this kind of goofy, likable, you know, veneer on the outside.
[03:41:39.240 --> 03:41:48.889]  But that hid a steely determination to become president and take care of anybody who needed to, who got in his way.
[03:41:48.889 --> 03:41:49.890]  And then he stood down.
[03:41:50.871 --> 03:41:54.514]  And let Bill Clinton in to be his second and third term.
[03:41:54.514 --> 03:42:00.738]  Well, he got orders from the same globalists who elected him saying, hey, George, you didn't do too well.
[03:42:00.738 --> 03:42:03.820]  We're going to have to replace you with a younger guy.
[03:42:03.820 --> 03:42:04.740]  Your time is up.
[03:42:04.740 --> 03:42:12.446]  That's why he looks at his watch, famously in the debate, because the globalists have told him he's being moved off the stage.
[03:42:12.446 --> 03:42:14.347]  He was never very talented.
[03:42:14.347 --> 03:42:15.728]  He believed in nothing.
[03:42:15.728 --> 03:42:17.529]  He had no ideology at all.
[03:42:17.529 --> 03:42:19.710]  By the way, they keep saying Trump believes in nothing.
[03:42:19.710 --> 03:42:20.391]  When we come back,
[03:42:21.311 --> 03:42:29.054]  Trump believes in America and free market and competition and fighting back against the establishment rich that were given their money versus somebody like him who actually made his money.
[03:42:29.054 --> 03:42:37.056]  That's what I believe the Trump ethos is and that he's smart enough to beat and outsmart all these bluebloods and stuffed shirts that he's grown up around.
[03:42:37.056 --> 03:42:40.077]  We'll see if I'm right with Roger Stone on the other side.
[03:42:40.077 --> 03:42:41.558]  Infowars.com.
[03:42:41.558 --> 03:42:42.638]  Newswars.com.
[03:42:42.638 --> 03:42:43.798]  I just can't get off the air.
[03:42:43.798 --> 03:42:44.699]  I just can't shut up.
[03:42:53.194 --> 03:42:55.556]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:42:55.556 --> 03:42:57.698]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:42:57.698 --> 03:43:01.641]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:43:01.641 --> 03:43:13.150]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:43:13.150 --> 03:43:22.257]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture floraLife as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.

[03:43:33.940 --> 03:43:36.201]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:43:36.201 --> 03:43:38.222]  Bought these, sold out in a month.
[03:43:39.219 --> 03:43:42.502]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:43:42.502 --> 03:43:44.544]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:43:44.544 --> 03:43:47.847]  We sold it at 50% off, till it sold out.
[03:43:47.847 --> 03:43:50.389]  And, I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:51.490]  Get yours today.
[03:43:51.490 --> 03:43:53.252]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:43:53.252 --> 03:43:57.956]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we haven't Infowarslife.
[03:43:58.777 --> 03:43:59.697]  They take hours.
[03:43:59.697 --> 03:44:02.118]  Michael's DX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:44:02.118 --> 03:44:03.299]  It's stronger.
[03:44:03.299 --> 03:44:04.919]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:44:04.919 --> 03:44:08.141]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:44:08.141 --> 03:44:09.261]  It's back in stock.
[03:44:09.261 --> 03:44:12.442]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:44:12.442 --> 03:44:16.204]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:44:16.204 --> 03:44:19.305]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[03:44:19.305 --> 03:44:20.205]  So you can upload it.
[03:44:20.205 --> 03:44:26.528]  And our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is
[03:44:27.188 --> 03:44:31.592]  Super blue silver immune gargle, that's a spray you do, you can also swallow it.
[03:44:31.592 --> 03:44:36.937]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[03:44:36.937 --> 03:44:38.338]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:44:38.338 --> 03:44:48.267]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com, and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:44:48.267 --> 03:44:51.310]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:44:55.080 --> 03:45:00.544]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:45:00.544 --> 03:45:01.384]  I take this.
[03:45:01.384 --> 03:45:02.525]  My family takes this.
[03:45:02.525 --> 03:45:06.808]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:45:06.808 --> 03:45:11.051]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:45:11.411 --> 03:45:16.052]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:45:16.052 --> 03:45:17.172]  I don't feel good.
[03:45:17.172 --> 03:45:20.933]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:45:20.933 --> 03:45:23.634]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:45:23.634 --> 03:45:29.415]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:45:29.415 --> 03:45:32.376]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:45:32.376 --> 03:45:35.796]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[03:45:35.796 --> 03:45:38.157]  So, obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[03:45:38.157 --> 03:45:38.517]  I love it.
[03:45:38.677 --> 03:45:41.479]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:45:41.479 --> 03:45:42.480]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:42.480 --> 03:45:48.164]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:48.164 --> 03:45:50.325]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:45:50.325 --> 03:45:52.527]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:45:54.363 --> 03:45:57.386]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:45:57.386 --> 03:46:01.591]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:46:01.591 --> 03:46:08.278]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:46:08.278 --> 03:46:12.043]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:46:12.743 --> 03:46:32.812]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:46:32.812 --> 03:46:36.354]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:46:36.934 --> 03:46:48.161]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[03:46:48.161 --> 03:46:57.066]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[03:46:57.066 --> 03:46:59.727]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:07.932 --> 03:47:15.235]  There are a lot of reasons people don't like Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[03:47:15.235 --> 03:47:18.516]  But I was just thinking about the chief amongst them all.
[03:47:18.516 --> 03:47:24.758]  From the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.758 --> 03:47:29.779]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:29.779 --> 03:47:31.660]  I know why they hate us.
[03:47:31.660 --> 03:47:33.381]  Because the globalists get unconscious.
[03:47:33.381 --> 03:47:36.562]  A lot of them are psychopaths, sociopaths, or mercenaries.
[03:47:37.605 --> 03:47:42.368]  They don't like hearing about the big picture, or about history, or about how they're failing.
[03:47:42.368 --> 03:47:44.210]  They like to be the only narrative.
[03:47:44.210 --> 03:47:47.352]  I've learned evil people are very OCD.
[03:47:47.352 --> 03:47:49.514]  Good people can be OCD as well.
[03:47:49.514 --> 03:47:53.777]  But they're very rote.
[03:47:53.777 --> 03:47:56.819]  They have a cant about what they do.
[03:47:56.819 --> 03:48:00.321]  And they don't like the disturbance of freedom.
[03:48:00.321 --> 03:48:02.943]  They don't like the volatile nature of the free market.
[03:48:07.250 --> 03:48:12.475]  I was just thinking, we talk about Prescott Bush and the Nazis and all of it.
[03:48:12.475 --> 03:48:16.499]  That's so fantastical and it's all real.
[03:48:16.499 --> 03:48:21.823]  And the crew, a lot of times we hire folks that are kind of agnostic politically and I go, I'm not worried about them.
[03:48:21.823 --> 03:48:25.267]  They're going to sit there in search engine when I say all day and see that I'm not lying.
[03:48:25.267 --> 03:48:28.830]  In fact, it's worse than I say.
[03:48:28.830 --> 03:48:30.612]  And see, the globalists think I'm a schmuck.
[03:48:31.772 --> 03:48:34.492]  They think because I care about other people that I'm an idiot.
[03:48:34.492 --> 03:48:36.173]  I'm not in the ruling class that's cold-blooded.
[03:48:36.173 --> 03:48:39.353]  Oh, I'm cold-blooded if I need to be.
[03:48:39.353 --> 03:48:56.056]  The difference is I know what built real civilization was people actually trying to have a better world and build a better system and build a better mousetrap and to have goals and destinies, not to dominate other people, but to elevate humanity through competition.
[03:48:56.056 --> 03:49:00.977]  But the whole left system is about ending competition and giving participation trophies to everybody.
[03:49:01.980 --> 03:49:03.120]  Again, I've said this a hundred times.
[03:49:03.120 --> 03:49:04.741]  It's not some virtue signaling.
[03:49:04.741 --> 03:49:06.041]  It's truth!
[03:49:06.041 --> 03:49:09.663]  I love people of every color and every region and every place.
[03:49:09.663 --> 03:49:15.085]  You can tell who's smart and who's got a good spirit and who gets it and who doesn't.
[03:49:15.085 --> 03:49:15.205]  And...
[03:49:16.897 --> 03:49:19.058]  I don't give a damn what color you are.
[03:49:19.058 --> 03:49:29.160]  If you've got a good attitude and you are having fun, whether it is about economics or politics or sexual, and I'm married, I'm just saying, I'm attracted to your energy.
[03:49:29.160 --> 03:49:35.362]  You can even have a woman who physically isn't that good looking, but if she's got a great attitude and is smart, I find that super sexy.
[03:49:35.362 --> 03:49:40.423]  You can have the most beautiful women out there that look like Barbie dolls and they're empty, narcissistic husks.
[03:49:41.834 --> 03:49:50.600]  If I wasn't married, I couldn't go out and date him, I couldn't have relations with him, because there's no grit, there's no substance, there's no soul.
[03:49:50.600 --> 03:49:58.866]  And all I know is this global system feels soulless, acts soulless, and I have no truck with it, nothing to do with it.
[03:49:58.866 --> 03:50:01.988]  How would you quantify this global system and what it's doing?
[03:50:01.988 --> 03:50:10.334]  And then this big letter, we should make a bigger deal out of it, I'm glad you said that, 11 valiant Congress members, who I know are gonna go through hell now, but they joined good company,
[03:50:10.854 --> 03:50:20.500]  That's how we get here is on a bunch of yes men saying criminal activity by the Clintons and Comey and all these people trying to set up the president.
[03:50:20.500 --> 03:50:21.901]  I mean, we have them.
[03:50:21.901 --> 03:50:23.041]  We have them.
[03:50:23.041 --> 03:50:24.102]  Get the rights.
[03:50:24.102 --> 03:50:28.925]  Don't we get they're only going to come after Trump and then like dominoes all the rest of us that have done nothing.
[03:50:28.925 --> 03:50:30.486]  I mean, I retweeted some guy this morning.
[03:50:30.486 --> 03:50:32.067]  Let's pull up again.
[03:50:32.067 --> 03:50:36.650]  Like 730 in the morning, I'm sitting there scrambling eggs for my kids, and I see this tweet that goes.
[03:50:37.935 --> 03:50:38.756]  Oh yeah, Jones?
[03:50:38.756 --> 03:50:44.880]  You say that it's, you know, Trump, and then Hannity, and then you, or the most outspoken, and then Tucker, and then somebody like Rogers Cohn.
[03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:49.163]  That's right, we know it's you, and Mueller's gonna arrest you soon, and all these retweets.
[03:50:49.163 --> 03:50:50.583]  Yeah, we're gonna put you in prison!
[03:50:50.583 --> 03:50:51.564]  We're gonna kill you!
[03:50:51.564 --> 03:50:53.786]  Hey, you're in a man's game now, boys!
[03:50:53.786 --> 03:50:57.888]  You came to a free country, you pissed all over, whether you're white, black, it doesn't matter.
[03:50:57.888 --> 03:51:04.032]  You're these little globalists, and you think the country that's giving you all this is the bad place, because we're trying to keep it going.
[03:51:04.032 --> 03:51:05.293]  You're morons!
[03:51:05.293 --> 03:51:07.475]  Yes, I know they might put me in prison or kill me.
[03:51:07.975 --> 03:51:10.178]  You always remind me like it scares me!
[03:51:10.178 --> 03:51:13.643]  It doesn't scare me, except for your damn soul!
[03:51:13.643 --> 03:51:16.106]  Because you're such pathetic sacks of crap!
[03:51:16.106 --> 03:51:18.249]  You don't have skin in the game like I do!
[03:51:18.249 --> 03:51:24.237]  You just sit there on your ass on Twitter, getting promoted by Twitter because you threaten people all day, you little piece of crap!
[03:51:24.977 --> 03:51:26.357]  Go ahead, Roger.
[03:51:26.357 --> 03:51:36.459]  Now, the amazing thing, Alex, you're absolutely right about the globalists and our political elite, is they hypnotize themselves into believing their own BS.
[03:51:36.459 --> 03:51:42.941]  They actually think they are august, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, special order.
[03:51:42.941 --> 03:51:47.082]  It's the sanctum, like, it's this, oh, we're so powerful.
[03:51:47.082 --> 03:51:48.722]  And then there's sacks of crap!
[03:51:49.182 --> 03:51:51.943]  No, these are venal, small-time criminals.
[03:51:51.943 --> 03:51:54.664]  Bill and Hillary, George and Barbara.
[03:51:54.664 --> 03:51:56.505]  They would steal a hot stove.
[03:51:56.505 --> 03:51:57.806]  They have no honor.
[03:51:57.806 --> 03:51:58.986]  They have no principle.
[03:51:58.986 --> 03:52:05.509]  They believe in nothing other than the accumulation of power and lining their own pockets.
[03:52:05.509 --> 03:52:06.509]  They're not worthy of praise.
[03:52:06.509 --> 03:52:09.851]  And that's why they keep thinking, intimidating us and messing with us.
[03:52:09.851 --> 03:52:12.492]  Haven't they noticed the more they mess with us, the more aggressive we get?
[03:52:13.032 --> 03:52:18.518]  Look, I understand I'm going to take a lot of crap for speaking the truth about Barbara Bush.
[03:52:18.518 --> 03:52:21.601]  She was a mean-spirited, vindictive drunk.
[03:52:21.601 --> 03:52:24.403]  She is ascending into hell right now.
[03:52:24.403 --> 03:52:25.885]  She's not going to heaven.
[03:52:25.885 --> 03:52:27.787]  She was a bad person.
[03:52:27.787 --> 03:52:30.429]  Don't lionize her because she was wonderful.
[03:52:30.429 --> 03:52:34.754]  She was married to a Nazi wealth crime syndicate, just like Junker, the head of the...
[03:52:34.994 --> 03:52:42.020]  We had the unelected head of the EU dictatorship, Ohns Luxemburg, and his grandfather and father were top Nazis!
[03:52:42.020 --> 03:52:43.421]  And then he lexed exactly!
[03:52:43.421 --> 03:52:47.224]  It's like, why do we roll over to the hype and the BS?
[03:52:47.224 --> 03:52:57.613]  Well, and the reason that this show is so controversial, the reason why the left hates Infowars is we have the courage to say these things.
[03:52:57.613 --> 03:52:58.073]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:52:58.073 --> 03:52:59.194]  The left wants war now.
[03:52:59.194 --> 03:52:59.654]  We don't.
[03:52:59.654 --> 03:53:00.455]  They don't like that.
[03:53:00.455 --> 03:53:03.938]  They want to just say, we're liberals, we're good, we want World War III, Heil Hitler.
[03:53:04.634 --> 03:53:11.396]  So, we reveal certain inconvenient truths, and it drives the left crazy.
[03:53:11.396 --> 03:53:26.482]  That's why these phony lawsuits to shut Infowars down, the lawsuits against me, against the president, they're trying to break us financially and create a rationale for taking us off the internet, for silencing us.
[03:53:26.482 --> 03:53:30.903]  Then there'll be nobody contradicting their BS when they tell us how great they are.
[03:53:30.903 --> 03:53:33.144]  And then they'll start World War III because the Russians aren't rolling over.
[03:53:34.258 --> 03:53:42.303]  Well, as I travel across the country meeting with the Proud Boys and Patriots all over, they're not rolling over either.
[03:53:42.303 --> 03:53:49.427]  If there is an attempt to illegitimately remove this president, you are going to have a civil war.
[03:53:49.427 --> 03:53:54.050]  We're not advocating it, we're not fomenting it, but we are recognizing it.
[03:53:54.050 --> 03:53:54.710]  It's not 1974.
[03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:55.211]  Absolutely.
[03:53:58.740 --> 03:53:59.820]  I forgot we have loaded phones.
[03:53:59.820 --> 03:54:03.041]  Is there any way to transfer these over when the war room starts so they can take them?
[03:54:03.041 --> 03:54:04.442]  I apologize to all these callers.
[03:54:04.442 --> 03:54:05.682]  I forgot we gave the number out.
[03:54:05.682 --> 03:54:07.722]  We didn't go to them.
[03:54:07.722 --> 03:54:09.123]  What are we going to do about that?
[03:54:09.123 --> 03:54:11.584]  Can we get, can all of them get first dibs?
[03:54:11.584 --> 03:54:14.384]  Charles and Josh and Justin and Tim and Roger and Mark.
[03:54:14.384 --> 03:54:16.145]  Can they all get first dibs?
[03:54:16.145 --> 03:54:17.265]  Our listeners are so great.
[03:54:17.265 --> 03:54:20.306]  Can we just open the phones up so only they call in right at the starter?
[03:54:20.306 --> 03:54:26.167]  Give them the number now so they can call in on the other side so they can go to calls very early next hour?
[03:54:26.167 --> 03:54:26.608]  We'll do that.
[03:54:26.608 --> 03:54:27.628]  What's the number on the other side?
[03:54:27.628 --> 03:54:27.988]  I forget it.
[03:54:33.988 --> 03:54:39.251]  So, 888-201-2244.
[03:54:39.251 --> 03:54:46.614]  You know, I should be smart and a big boy and write that down.
[03:54:46.614 --> 03:54:47.575]  What's up, Daria?
[03:54:47.575 --> 03:54:52.558]  It's 888 what?
[03:54:52.558 --> 03:54:54.579]  Your mic's not open, go ahead.
[03:54:54.579 --> 03:54:54.979]  Oh, there it is!
[03:54:54.979 --> 03:54:55.019]  888-201-2244.
[03:55:01.550 --> 03:55:01.570]  2244.
[03:55:01.570 --> 03:55:03.872]  And those folks will get, they're already hanging up.
[03:55:03.872 --> 03:55:06.013]  They'll get in front of the line when they call in.
[03:55:06.013 --> 03:55:06.554]  Just briefly.
[03:55:07.688 --> 03:55:12.130]  If you take action, they cannot stop us short of putting bullets in our heads, okay?
[03:55:12.130 --> 03:55:13.830]  And nobody's going to buy that.
[03:55:13.830 --> 03:55:17.992]  So, if you simply go get water filters, they're the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[03:55:17.992 --> 03:55:21.413]  Air filters, super high quality, lowest prices.
[03:55:21.413 --> 03:55:27.396]  If you simply go get Super Mill Vitality, amazing cold-pressed herbs, where it takes five, six times the amount of herbs.
[03:55:27.396 --> 03:55:31.137]  When it's just powder, you don't get it as well, so it's like still alive, basically.
[03:55:31.137 --> 03:55:32.858]  Fifty percent off, that is a huge deal.
[03:55:33.678 --> 03:55:39.003]  You can get it with free shipping and 50% off with the real Red Pill or Alpha Power that's back in.
[03:55:39.003 --> 03:55:43.287]  And Alpha Power technically is stronger, but some people get better results with Supramel because it's cold press.
[03:55:43.287 --> 03:55:44.909]  It all depends on how your body works.
[03:55:44.909 --> 03:55:46.310]  Some people go, well, is Alpha Power better?
[03:55:46.310 --> 03:55:47.251]  Is Supramel better?
[03:55:47.251 --> 03:55:48.573]  Is, is, is, is.
[03:55:49.865 --> 03:55:50.885]  What's the best?
[03:55:50.885 --> 03:55:52.626]  It's all different for different people.
[03:55:52.626 --> 03:55:53.826]  They're different formulas.
[03:55:53.826 --> 03:55:56.446]  They have some of the same things, not some of the same things.
[03:55:56.446 --> 03:56:00.447]  It varies person to person, your physiology, your metabolic system.
[03:56:00.447 --> 03:56:03.568]  But we've got combo packs with free shipping on top of it.
[03:56:03.568 --> 03:56:06.108]  And so it takes a lot of sales for us to fund the operation.
[03:56:06.108 --> 03:56:07.949]  But these are game changing products.
[03:56:07.949 --> 03:56:13.070]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:14.490]  We have had X2 for almost six years.
[03:56:19.560 --> 03:56:23.381]  It's the only mined, deep earth, pure iodine crystals out there.
[03:56:23.381 --> 03:56:24.401]  The good halogen.
[03:56:24.401 --> 03:56:25.362]  It blows people away.
[03:56:25.362 --> 03:56:27.802]  Energy, stamina, just everything.
[03:56:27.802 --> 03:56:30.083]  People that have major issues though, you need to talk to your physician before.
[03:56:30.083 --> 03:56:35.065]  98% reviews at Power Reviews of thousands, 6,000 plus reviews.
[03:56:35.065 --> 03:56:35.745]  Nobody's got that.
[03:56:36.690 --> 03:56:40.592]  We are running out of it, but we weren't going to get more until June, the middle of June.
[03:56:40.592 --> 03:56:46.634]  They are accelerating a small, not even a half shipment, they correct me, a quarter shipment of a few thousand bottles.
[03:56:46.634 --> 03:56:52.797]  So I can extend the sale out for four or five more days, and then it's still going to end up selling out before we get more in June.
[03:56:53.337 --> 03:57:01.483]  And then we have the rest of that run, and another run, and then we have not gotten more, and they've already charged us more, but I'm not increasing the price.
[03:57:01.483 --> 03:57:07.868]  Get your X2 survival shield, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about how all the other forms are bound and very hard for you to absorb.
[03:57:07.868 --> 03:57:11.952]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[03:57:11.952 --> 03:57:20.438]  And they can't stand the fact you're financially supporting us, and the Soros can't stamp out American freedom and American free speech, like the universities have done.
[03:57:20.438 --> 03:57:21.219]  They're so angry.
[03:57:22.717 --> 03:57:28.600]  And they're so angry that you're waking up to supplements and things that also help you and your family and fund this operation.
[03:57:28.600 --> 03:57:30.361]  A true 360 win.
[03:57:30.361 --> 03:57:34.622]  They're so angry that your will is stronger than them, so thank you all for your support.
[03:57:34.622 --> 03:57:36.483]  All right, this transmission's ending.
[03:57:36.483 --> 03:57:37.544]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[03:57:37.544 --> 03:57:42.066]  He'll be back in mere minutes to take phone calls and more with Owen Schroyer on The War Room.
