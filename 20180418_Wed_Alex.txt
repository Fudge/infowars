[00:17.880 --> 00:29.880]  it's alex jones ladies and gentlemen wow what an incredible time to be alive anybody
[00:29.880 --> 00:35.080]  tells you that things aren't very exciting and that amazing things aren't happening is
[00:35.080 --> 00:40.240]  either completely stupid or they're living on another planet here's just some of the
[00:40.240 --> 00:44.840]  headlines and news i've got in front of us there's a huge internal war going on inside
[00:44.840 --> 00:50.480]  the white house between the hawks and the people that don't want thermonuclear war i'd
[00:50.480 --> 00:56.720]  say between the hawks and the super hawks it's not like mattis is a dove but the sane
[00:56.720 --> 01:02.520]  hawks piece their strength and the foaming at the mouth types like nicky hayley who is
[01:02.520 --> 01:06.840]  just dumbered in a box of rocks and a mistake that trump ever put her in there well when
[01:06.840 --> 01:14.000]  they came out and said the president never said sanctions you're mistaken she said i
[01:14.000 --> 01:22.160]  don't get confused and now we know mattis has been overruled by trump being manipulated
[01:22.160 --> 01:29.360]  by bolton we got a warmonger in the henhouse folks and of course nicky hayley and look
[01:29.360 --> 01:33.360]  how much disrespect they have for the president out there shooting off their mouths and the
[01:33.360 --> 01:40.960]  left are calling for war war war war war because that's so liberal simply insane so
[01:40.960 --> 01:46.880]  and we've got internal sources in the pentagon and in the white house and they say this fight
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.120]  is just raging right now and the media you notice when oh trump's approval ratings up
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.320]  as he launched a war it was always up but they let them actually have a real pull for
[01:57.320 --> 02:06.200]  a week or so to manipulate the president we've been down this road before then continuing
[02:06.200 --> 02:10.920]  there's a report out it's on info wars dot com mexico agrees to pay for the wall offering
[02:10.920 --> 02:19.600]  emergency deal to close down nafta tariff loophole that's coming up also we've got
[02:19.600 --> 02:25.680]  critical reports eu chiefs over the quote integration of europe with the rest of the
[02:25.680 --> 02:31.400]  world say they want 200 million africans not to mention other separate groups are bringing
[02:31.400 --> 02:37.840]  in in the next 30 years brought in enforced integration this is their words and they say
[02:37.840 --> 02:43.320]  it will cause civil war and will cause the welfare state to collapse but it's the right
[02:43.320 --> 02:48.920]  thing to do well how about we just transplant 200 million europeans there's only 300 million
[02:48.920 --> 02:54.640]  in europe into north africa oh that would be an invasion that would be genocide that
[02:54.640 --> 02:58.920]  would be gentrification that would be the end of the world but when the left says okay
[02:58.920 --> 03:02.600]  our plan is to break down the borders just like they've done with the airspring that's
[03:02.600 --> 03:07.600]  why that's so critical to stop and do this but what's amazing is why would macron and
[03:07.600 --> 03:11.320]  others come out of the head of the union program and admit it all because they know I'm exposing
[03:11.320 --> 03:16.360]  it they know that the president of Hungary is exposing it they know Nigel Farage is
[03:16.360 --> 03:20.560]  exposing it and they know well okay we can't just let them expose it we've got to go ahead
[03:20.560 --> 03:25.040]  and get out ahead of it throw it out there and admit the whole thing that's coming up
[03:25.040 --> 03:29.800]  simply amazing how the global see stabilize the third world then weaponize it against
[03:29.800 --> 03:35.320]  the west and bring it in in mass to be controlled by the left 85 percent I was saying 80 percent
[03:35.320 --> 03:40.040]  Paul Watson correct me yesterday and sent me the news article 85 percent of quote migrants
[03:40.040 --> 03:47.200]  that's invaders in Europe the last five years are still on welfare they're not working it's
[03:47.200 --> 03:51.280]  killing the terrorism it's killing everything it's like tourism's dying in san francisco

[06:39.340 --> 06:44.480]  stone in the war room is coming up after that i gotta tell you i am extremely honored to
[06:44.480 --> 06:49.840]  be under massive globalist attack because i know that we've been damaging their authoritarian
[06:49.840 --> 06:54.320]  world government of an exposing their murderous criminal wars their alliance of the radical
[06:54.320 --> 07:00.160]  islam their alliance with the narco terrorist organizations we have been causing massive
[07:00.160 --> 07:08.000]  awakenings all over the world from the uk to eastern europe from brazil to areas of
[07:08.000 --> 07:14.840]  africa and info wars has been credited our guest our listeners my crew this whole operation
[07:14.840 --> 07:21.720]  by the globalist and major white papers and major congressional hearings with the cia
[07:21.720 --> 07:28.120]  and the defense department and the democratic party we have been credited with the nationalist
[07:28.120 --> 07:36.000]  populist revolutions worldwide we are seen as a central core pillar of the global awakening
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.440]  and so because of that we're going through massive continued scyops and i'm gonna explain
[07:42.440 --> 07:48.640]  coming up at the bottom of the hour why we're going through those scyops and why they're
[07:48.640 --> 07:54.240]  trying to set the precedent to shut us down to then shut everyone else down that is coming
[07:54.240 --> 08:03.120]  up at the bottom of the hour ap is the only publication out of dozens i looked at hundreds
[08:03.120 --> 08:07.520]  of headlines i looked at that there's 30 plus thousand articles out right now since yesterday
[08:07.520 --> 08:13.760]  saying alex jones says no one died at sandy hook alex jones says you know he the parents
[08:13.760 --> 08:18.880]  are liars all these other incredible lies and then never quoting what i really said
[08:18.880 --> 08:22.400]  there's a few little short clips where i played devil's advocate years ago saying could have
[08:22.400 --> 08:25.680]  completely happened like they say could have been a hoax because governments have been
[08:25.680 --> 08:29.880]  caught lying before but we investigated and for about four years i've been saying i believe
[08:29.880 --> 08:36.800]  children died there but they still reboot it believing it's something that hurts me
[08:36.800 --> 08:41.480]  and then they throw it out there but if you actually read the lawsuit against us it's
[08:41.480 --> 08:47.240]  for saying that the parents are out there part of anti-gun control groups that are putting
[08:47.240 --> 08:55.520]  out anti-gun control talking points and that we have a right to then criticize people that
[08:55.520 --> 08:59.280]  are pushing for the abolition of the second amendment just like they said that i said
[08:59.280 --> 09:04.160]  david hogg was a 24-year-old crisis actor and just like they've been saying in the media
[09:04.160 --> 09:13.120]  for the last month that i said that no one died at parkland no where did we say that
[09:13.120 --> 09:19.760]  they then source on abc news cbs nbc cnn a clip of oan shroyer that was taken down by
[09:19.760 --> 09:26.120]  youtube it put back up and it got 14 million views once we put it back up where oan said
[09:26.120 --> 09:31.080]  we're not saying they're crisis actors we're not saying they're 24 we're not saying the
[09:31.080 --> 09:34.760]  shooting didn't happen we're saying they pick four students out of 3000 to give scripted
[09:34.760 --> 09:39.400]  anti-gun messages and they're funded by the democrats and george soros that's all completely
[09:39.400 --> 09:46.920]  admitted fact i expect they'll sue me after this hype in a few months saying no students
[09:46.920 --> 09:52.000]  died and all of it it'll be a frivolous suit it'll be thrown out it's not true but they'll
[09:52.000 --> 10:01.520]  run the headline everywhere as well and the media is trying to get somebody to kill me
[10:01.520 --> 10:07.420]  that's what they're doing all of our affiliates heard us on valentine's day and the day after
[10:07.420 --> 10:13.480]  have students on who said that there were multiple shooters we don't know that's true
[10:13.480 --> 10:17.760]  or not so the witnesses said local news as well and that the police stood down well it
[10:17.760 --> 10:28.080]  came out that the police did stand down so you can go to info wars dot com scroll back
[10:28.080 --> 10:33.720]  i'll give radio listeners the title of the article you can watch the band videos then
[10:33.720 --> 10:37.680]  you can watch the news is response lying about them watch these info wars videos were banned
[10:37.680 --> 10:46.320]  by youtube info wars dot com we were able to repost them show you what we really said
[10:46.320 --> 10:53.000]  they had to back down 14 million people watch the two videos of us saying we are not saying
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.200]  they're crisis actors we're saying they've been picked because they're anti gun and they're
[10:57.200 --> 11:01.920]  having stage town halls and it came out they were given the kids the questions to ask and
[11:01.920 --> 11:07.440]  it was all scripted the response the jumping on the bandwagon using the crisis to blame
[11:07.440 --> 11:13.080]  godowners and demonize the second amendment they don't want me pointing that out so they
[11:13.080 --> 11:19.240]  misrepresented and they edit videos together you've seen them do it where i said i'm not
[11:19.240 --> 11:26.760]  against gays but they say i'm against gays and co-bear on cbs and comedy central on
[11:26.760 --> 11:34.200]  by biacom same group most vicious you can go watch the where they show me going i don't
[11:34.200 --> 11:39.880]  like gays well it's not my fault that they edit what i do it's their fault that they
[11:39.880 --> 11:47.880]  edit it everybody knows they do it and that's why they're falling apart what i've said about
[11:47.880 --> 11:52.120]  sandy hook is if they caught them lying about babies out incubators that launched a war
[11:52.120 --> 11:55.960]  that killed millions of people in iraq and we've got caught government media fixing
[11:55.960 --> 12:01.040]  polls and lying and staging stuff i don't blame people that see stuff on mainstream news and
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.760]  don't believe a word of it i can see how they believe it's all actors and it's all fake that's
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.880]  the clip they take out but we've investigated it real school shootings happen i don't think
[12:10.880 --> 12:17.880]  the globalists are that bold but you're allowed to question things in america that's not defamation
[12:17.880 --> 12:23.000]  but what is defamation is to file lawsuits that say i said things i didn't say and then
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.080]  put me and my whole family through the ringer and lie about us and hold us up against dead
[12:27.080 --> 12:32.040]  children and say basically we hate their families we hate the children it's almost like i murdered
[12:32.040 --> 12:36.480]  the children and that's not what happened and our listeners know the truth and we're receiving
[12:36.480 --> 12:43.280]  record traffic at news wars dot com prison planet dot com and info wars dot com because
[12:43.280 --> 12:50.240]  people want to find out what is this all about just like calling trump a racist but there's
[12:50.240 --> 12:55.600]  no evidence just like calling all his supporters nazis just like us say today with the headline
[12:55.600 --> 13:00.520]  a few days ago that all of trump supporters are racist and immoral that's defamation against
[13:00.520 --> 13:05.640]  the american people but they're doing it hashtag hunt republicans the new york times saying
[13:05.640 --> 13:08.720]  hey they don't have any security over here they're playing baseball somebody ought to
[13:08.720 --> 13:13.520]  go give them a visit well blitzer having guessed on saying the guy that shots khalise
[13:13.520 --> 13:19.880]  was a hero all of their bullying all of their attacks and then they want to frame those of
[13:19.880 --> 13:24.240]  us questioning all this and those of us standing up against globalism and open borders and
[13:24.240 --> 13:35.720]  the big mega banks and all this unelected tpp they want to be able to bully us and silence
[13:35.720 --> 13:39.960]  us and they're going authoritarian and that's what this is and because we've been so effective
[13:39.960 --> 13:44.560]  because you've supported us and you've spread the word they're coming after us that our
[13:44.560 --> 13:50.240]  affiliates and our listeners and our sponsors the ones they haven't taken know the truth
[13:50.240 --> 13:55.440]  and so it is dizzying the amount of tv networks and systems that are calling us and turning
[13:55.440 --> 13:58.920]  us on i don't even want to celebrate some of this because i know they'll try to go harass
[13:58.920 --> 14:02.720]  them but these these networks and stations already know that and we've broken through
[14:02.720 --> 14:07.720]  here they've jumped the shark this is really really backfired but then i started realizing
[14:07.720 --> 14:12.600]  last night this morning they don't care they're going for broke on every front like having
[14:12.600 --> 14:15.800]  hillary's favorite judge that they wanted to be her attorney general and clinton's attorney
[14:15.800 --> 14:22.280]  general who married george soros and his wife his third wife two years ago and allowed the
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.920]  raid on his private lawyer unrelated from russia gate and now gave it all to leak to
[14:26.920 --> 14:32.760]  the media on record ordered it put in a federal database where all the federal and fbi people
[14:32.760 --> 14:37.240]  can get it not just the investigators that's never done people that are on that case get
[14:37.240 --> 14:41.600]  it not the entire bureau namely because if there's corrupt fbi agents in there you don't
[14:41.600 --> 14:48.600]  want them to tip people off that's the so-called reason so you cannot make this up and i'm
[14:48.600 --> 14:53.040]  honored to have that old evil nazi collaborator soros back in a lot of these lawsuits and financing
[14:53.040 --> 14:58.240]  them on record that'll all come out in discovery but most of these will be thrown out on summary
[14:58.240 --> 15:01.640]  judgment and that's just their tactic is to put out these fake bills and drive with the
[15:01.640 --> 15:06.720]  mud and i've already kind of covered it but the original sandy hook we looked at it because
[15:06.720 --> 15:10.680]  there's been other hoaxes and i don't think the thing was a hoax the media jumped on it
[15:10.680 --> 15:14.720]  they exacerbated it they faked some locations they did some things in the aftermath the
[15:14.720 --> 15:23.720]  cnn is famous for them but the new hoax is official saying that i'm currently saying
[15:23.720 --> 15:28.760]  they're all crisis actors and it didn't happen when i never called them crisis actors my
[15:28.760 --> 15:33.040]  listeners said a lot of them look like they're acting we looked at it and i said i can't
[15:33.040 --> 15:38.440]  say that that's what i've always said and they know that so they just put out the headline
[15:38.440 --> 15:43.280]  jones says they're all actors jones says it's all fake doesn't even say all the years all
[15:43.280 --> 15:48.480]  the hundreds of times i've said that i think it was real no one quotes that but ap ap still
[15:48.480 --> 15:53.840]  has some fraction of real journalism i guess because ap got it right and said jones says
[15:53.840 --> 15:57.600]  he believes any cook happened and has been saying it for years but all the others they're
[15:57.600 --> 16:03.720]  fake media fully cooked ready to eat bacon i'm talking thick meaty center cut presidential

[20:43.680 --> 20:48.840]  of sexual assaults hillary covering up for it very politely she was viciously and hatefully
[20:48.840 --> 20:56.280]  thrown out she was demonized and then she was attacked on the street by so-called feminist
[20:56.280 --> 21:01.040]  because you do not talk about their leftist gods we're going to be posting that video

[21:52.720 --> 21:57.520]  all day whether kewin on's real or not zacks the real deal and a great source he's got
[21:57.520 --> 22:01.960]  big news on the internal fights inside the white house with nickie hailey of people
[22:01.960 --> 22:07.440]  saying we're not doing sanctions yes we are i don't get confused i'm in command remember
[22:07.440 --> 22:14.720]  she was the never trump her she led the never trump movement and launch zuckerberg's open
[22:14.720 --> 22:23.840]  borders group she's a globalist and she wants to devastate eastern european borders for the
[22:23.840 --> 22:30.840]  muslim invasion that macron and the head of the ee immigration program say will turn
[22:30.840 --> 22:35.920]  europe into north africa that's their quote europe faces unprecedented mass migration
[22:35.920 --> 22:41.560]  shares destiny with africa fifteen million african migrants are already there twenty
[22:41.560 --> 22:45.920]  million more within thirty years and that's the current number they're bringing in every
[22:45.920 --> 22:53.040]  year it's about two million middle easterners two million north africans they want to increase
[22:53.040 --> 22:59.480]  that five-fold a year just total devastation this is the economic warfare of the globalist
[22:59.480 --> 23:03.920]  who attacks exempt offshore and will use this to devastate EU parliament member calls for
[23:03.920 --> 23:08.980]  banning political parties that criticize immigration swedish student reported to security services
[23:08.980 --> 23:15.080]  for spreading facts about immigration that is just the news every day you kept leader
[23:15.080 --> 23:22.040]  blast you in agenda to flood west with never ending millions of migrants gerard batten rips
[23:22.040 --> 23:26.640]  your africa plan to EU parliament that get me that video crew there's so many videos
[23:26.640 --> 23:31.840]  on the play that crew this is this is happening this is unbelievable imagine putting two hundred
[23:31.840 --> 23:36.800]  million europeans in north africa but i guess we're looking for the mythical super city
[23:36.800 --> 23:44.640]  of wakanda and the vibranium i think you're gonna find it in europe and again the globalists
[23:44.640 --> 23:49.520]  have gone exploited africa controlled it dominated destroyed libya that was stabilizing africa
[23:49.520 --> 23:54.880]  africa could be a great place and the very same globalist exploited africa are now exploiting
[23:54.880 --> 23:59.760]  europe everything else it's reversed colonialism by the offshore globalist that are tax exempt
[23:59.760 --> 24:04.320]  we understand that factor we lose and here's the deal why is macron and the head of the
[24:04.320 --> 24:09.960]  EU program on a read this whole article coming up why are they being so honest because in
[24:09.960 --> 24:13.440]  poland and in hungary and in the Czech republic and all over people are getting elected to
[24:13.440 --> 24:17.880]  understand this the people get it so instead of the EU denying its plan when it's in their
[24:17.880 --> 24:23.800]  own documents they're going yeah what's the big deal they're hiding it in plain view and
[24:23.800 --> 24:28.840]  they talk about eastern europe is going to revolt and will have to be militarily occupied
[24:28.840 --> 24:34.560]  for the genocide culturally to be carried out this is all being just openly stated kind
[24:34.560 --> 24:39.720]  of like banning free speech in europe banning free speech here and info wars is being used
[24:39.720 --> 24:45.080]  as a case point to misrepresent what we said try to make it illegal to question public
[24:45.080 --> 24:50.480]  events big mass casual events like vegas we were told the guy was his llamas gun dealer
[24:50.480 --> 24:53.640]  he'd been to the middle east a bunch he was there days before there was a stand down it
[24:53.640 --> 24:58.120]  was really the soddies in town part of a Saudi civil war for a Saudi military convention
[24:58.120 --> 25:03.160]  with the crown prince there and his enemy the other crown prince and months later that
[25:03.160 --> 25:07.360]  all came out and they still won't say officially what happened they don't want us on air to
[25:07.360 --> 25:15.280]  have those guests on like zack and zack's information dovetailed with the fbi hostage
[25:15.280 --> 25:22.840]  rescue team i got that directly from the hostage rescue team and the government knows that
[25:22.840 --> 25:30.280]  and they're angry the criminal elements of it the good government elements told us that
[25:30.280 --> 25:35.160]  understand the google contract came out last year google takes out major contracts elastin
[25:35.160 --> 25:39.400]  info wars ron paul's mentioned as well they don't mess with their algorithm now i can
[25:39.400 --> 25:42.840]  tell it's broken they have done that they screwed the whole thing up and if nothing
[25:42.840 --> 25:47.720]  works on anymore it's all a big fraud but they hired to pay millions and outside firm
[25:47.720 --> 25:52.240]  to delist as they said because we were saying that the chemical attacks were staged in false
[25:52.240 --> 25:59.200]  flags and let's go to that next the articles on info wars dot com again it's on info wars
[25:59.200 --> 26:08.480]  dot com and news wars dot com we have senator ran paul coming out last night on fox news
[26:08.480 --> 26:12.920]  and saying basically it's a false flag there's no way Assad would actually do this the rebels
[26:12.920 --> 26:17.960]  have been caught doing it before again the story is on info wars dot com that's a separate
[26:17.960 --> 26:22.640]  one today that we've got on screen ran paul warren's new u.s. war powers will rubber
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.880]  stamp for global conflict we're gonna get that coming up the the other article is from
[26:26.880 --> 26:35.440]  last night on info wars dot com ran paul says syrian gas attack probably a false flag but
[26:35.440 --> 26:39.640]  let's go ahead and go to that video here it is in fact for that matter i still look at
[26:39.640 --> 26:44.240]  the attack and say you know Assad either must be the dumbest dictator on the planet or maybe
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.400]  didn't do it i have yet to see evidence that he did do it the intelligence agencies claim
[26:49.400 --> 26:53.120]  they have that evidence but think about it does it make any sense he's been winning the
[26:53.120 --> 26:58.320]  war for the last couple of years the only thing that would galvanize the world to attack
[26:58.320 --> 27:04.520]  Assad directly is a chemical attack it killed relatively few people compared to what can
[27:04.520 --> 27:09.240]  be killed with traditional bombs traditional machine guns traditional tanks and so you
[27:09.240 --> 27:15.000]  wonder really what logic would there be for Assad to be using chemical weapons why would
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.400]  you target 50 something civilians that have no military value it's knowing it's the one
[27:19.400 --> 27:23.880]  thing that'll get you destroyed right as you've won and the u.s. and russia are pulling out
[27:23.880 --> 27:30.120]  riddle me that batman we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back and drill into more
[27:30.120 --> 27:34.820]  of the demonization of european culture and whites by mainstream media and then a really
[27:34.820 --> 27:41.040]  hilarious super on target man that i want to get on the show black guy walks into star
[27:41.040 --> 27:46.440]  buck says racist immediately gets free coffee white guilt gone wild i'm gonna do this myself
[27:46.440 --> 27:49.880]  and see what happens and it's gonna be racist if they don't give me my coffee because i'm
[27:49.880 --> 27:55.440]  opposing racism myself i deserve some free coffee as well effect i think this guy deserves
[27:55.440 --> 28:02.640]  a free starbucks shop you know the funny thing about what's happening in europe is they're
[28:02.640 --> 28:05.680]  saying bring 200 million africans to europe but then in south africa they're killing the
[28:05.680 --> 28:11.240]  farmers saying get out and then but then telling australia don't let the white farmers escape
[28:11.240 --> 28:15.200]  but that's the racist communist leaders of south africa not your average african or this
[28:15.200 --> 28:20.280]  fella who's an american who really knows how to expose and troll the ridiculous reverse
[28:20.280 --> 28:24.840]  racism against white people so god bless him that's coming up the next segment briefly

[49:36.560 --> 49:42.800]  strategy of total divide and conquer that we've got a lot of people who see right through this
[49:42.800 --> 49:47.120]  like this is a video up on info wars dot com we'll get this fellow on black guy walks into starbucks
[49:47.120 --> 49:55.280]  says racist immediately gets free coffee the little intro video you just saw deals with the fact that
[49:55.280 --> 50:00.320]  the globalist are building towards destabilizing the borders of europe by putting radical islamic
[50:00.320 --> 50:04.320]  regimes in who do horrible things to the men women and children of those countries and
[50:04.320 --> 50:10.880]  commit incredible war crimes sell women into sex slavery you name it then soros ferries across on

[50:29.520 --> 50:35.120]  big corporate ceo's to a man and woman who almost pay no taxes or multinational international
[50:35.120 --> 50:42.000]  diplomatic community to further create white guilt and exacerbate tensions and then if it
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.960]  happens that you have obviously a black activist leftist activists come in they won't buy anything
[50:46.960 --> 50:51.040]  they want to use the bathroom they sit there in the restaurant you have a policy that you
[50:51.040 --> 50:55.200]  can't do that what restaurant wouldn't throw you out of you just came and said i'm gonna sit here

[51:10.880 --> 51:17.040]  you're like no get out no loitering it's called loitering and so this fellow that's up on info

[51:27.680 --> 51:31.840]  the stunt was in response to the news that starbucks is set to close eight thousand stores

[51:36.320 --> 51:42.320]  race-based training they're doing implicit association test the professors that developed
[51:42.320 --> 51:50.480]  it said it's a fraud and doesn't work so again it's all about creating white guilt and so he
[51:50.480 --> 51:56.640]  walks in and talks to this young woman working going to college at the same time and she says oh

[54:19.520 --> 54:24.160]  believe me it's a lot better than some of our ghettos in many areas so this idea is just insane
[54:24.160 --> 54:28.640]  that you're white you owe somebody something because you're white even if your great-granddaddy was
[54:28.640 --> 54:34.640]  ahead of the kkk you know and a bad person how how is what they did if my dad was a bank robber
[54:35.600 --> 54:39.600]  how does that make me a bank robber what is this thing where if somebody in my family did
[54:39.600 --> 54:47.280]  something i'm involved that's authoritarianism but let's let's finish this clip up i'll take caramel

[55:32.080 --> 55:39.040]  that guy's other videos are great too he's just being sarcastic illustrating the whole insanity
[55:39.040 --> 55:44.240]  you got two young white women they both look neck liberal kind of low-level well-meaning liberals
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.480]  not the evil type to control them and manipulate them through guilt they're in there hustling you
[55:48.480 --> 55:53.040]  were going to starbucks man those people are hustling boom boom boom boom and uh these people
[55:53.040 --> 55:56.320]  are every race color and crewe working in a starbucks i don't go in there anymore because
[55:56.320 --> 56:01.360]  they're so anti-gun and push all this race garbage but i will be going in i think today on the way
[56:01.360 --> 56:06.320]  home i'm gonna drop by one and walk up and say i want my free coffee because you're racist i heard
[56:06.320 --> 56:13.600]  you're racist they're gonna say well you're not black and i'm gonna say hey equal i want my free
[56:13.600 --> 56:18.800]  coffee now when they say get out i'll say okay i'm just illustrating a sociology experiment but i
[56:18.800 --> 56:22.720]  think everybody should go do this in fact i think this young man deserves a free starbucks coffee
[56:22.720 --> 56:29.040]  shop because it's black but you think about that ladies and gentlemen you think about what's going
[56:29.040 --> 56:34.800]  on 200 million north africans those are muslims they're the ones that the slave black people
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.440]  they're part black they're also part quote arabic that's a mix of white
[56:39.440 --> 56:43.600]  asian and and and and african that's what arabic generally is arabic's a language but
[56:43.600 --> 56:49.680]  arab's that's what arab's are genetically tested um but they still have that casting where they see
[56:49.680 --> 56:54.160]  people that are darker or under them you're gonna bring some of the most racist misogynistic people
[56:54.160 --> 56:58.480]  that are the scourge of sub-saharan africa that's invading all the way down into africa
[56:58.480 --> 57:02.640]  and enslaving and killing african christians animus you name it you're gonna bring them on in
[57:03.600 --> 57:06.880]  now we're going to break we're gonna come back i didn't get into the sandy hook stuff but this
[57:06.880 --> 57:11.600]  all ties into the same thing just like the media sells these hoaxes not the sandy hook didn't happen
[57:11.600 --> 57:15.760]  as a hoax but the hoax that i am still saying it never happened for years i've been saying i
[57:15.760 --> 57:20.080]  believed it happened i only questioned it as others did up front that's another media hoax
[57:20.080 --> 57:24.560]  to demonize me and try to get my butt killed i'm telling you that's what they're doing but ap got it
[57:24.560 --> 57:28.880]  right and actually admitted that i haven't been saying it in years so put that in your pipe and

[59:56.320 --> 01:00:13.040]  discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the alex jones show
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.680]  well i tell you we've had ben garrison on and many other talented artists but
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:34.720]  this guy just does an incredible job he goes by uh shabo and his website is unsavoryagents.com
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:41.680]  at the new punks and i agree with him and paul watson libertarianism is the new conservatism
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:49.280]  i don't want to call it that is the new counter culture the left is the establishment they're
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:59.360]  the anti-free speech authoritarians and he does this street art where it's just stickers and things
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:06.720]  that can be easily peeled off they're the no-stick stickers and then it becomes national news each
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.320]  time and now other people are imitating him and for years i've wanted to have the money for an art
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.600]  department that when our crews go out around the country to cover other events they take some of
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.920]  these with them and then do a stunt in that city and of course you've seen laura lumar and others
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.040]  go up to coward county sheriff's department put stickers on the front of the sheriff's department
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.680]  saying or somebody did i don't know what's her i'm just guessing uh you know saying that you know
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.240]  wanted for for being cowards and then show the sheriff and the deputies that stood down reportedly
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:44.720]  so this is a powerful way to strike back it's a powerful way to stand up and i intend to start
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:50.640]  doing this in austin i just got to get the ball rolling and create the graphics and kind of measure
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:56.080]  them out so they can go and you know on some areas in the city and then just go videotape it and show
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.480]  left us then because you can set up in a car and videotape it pulling it down it won't be up long
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:04.960]  but you get the story of it out people talking about it then it goes out in the cyberspace
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:12.320]  and it has a huge effect so very very very very very excited also he had his twitter count suspended
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:20.880]  uh because he is a powerful artist and it's been said many times you want to counter authoritarianism
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:28.000]  do it with art republicans are the new punk he did the uh a lot of trump street heart he's done
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.440]  so much so the next 30 minutes we're gonna go over a lot of this but he had his original twitter
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:38.880]  taken down i guess he's got a new one he's gonna fill us all in on this uh is it sabo or sabo
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.800]  how's the best way to pronounce it it's sabo it's uh it's named after tank round i was in the marine
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:50.720]  corps and i named it after one of the rounds that's right is that the abrams and also the
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:57.920]  bradley fighting vehicle around where it's a du accelerated sabo i'm old school man i was m 60
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.800]  series tanks it's like as soon as i left they switched over to the abrams the marines get the
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:09.520]  scraps that's right you guys were just the marines still just a decade ago had tanks from vietnam
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.400]  yeah and i was on one of them uh we're putting reactive armor on them and everything
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.600]  uh you know i was recently in austin uh with the proud boys and three bars asked us to leave
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.520]  they said we don't want your type here and i couldn't help but wonder what the hell type of you talking
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:34.800]  about the left has gone into it just a hysterical authoritarianism oh they've lost their minds and
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:40.880]  i love it it was one year into trump's election so i mean it would be one thing if it was two
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:46.880]  three years in but i can't help to see where they go in the next year or two well let me tell you're
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.400]  one of the best artists out there when we come back i want to review some of your great art from
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:57.120]  your website talk about how you've been censored but at a gut level what is the peak level the
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.000]  authoritarian left will go to because they just get more violent more aggressive lawsuits threats
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.640]  they say kill republicans i mean at what point do we take the gloves off there is and i've said
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:15.760]  this forever there is no level they will sink if you gave them everything that they asked for
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:21.360]  the next day they would come back with a list with 10 other demands etc etc that there's no
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:27.840]  end to it the thing is uh republicans they just want to have barbecues and uh raise their kids
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:35.200]  and have a job everyone on the left is politically active we need to learn to do the same i know it
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:41.680]  sucks politics isn't sexy but unfortunately if if we don't do it man they're just gonna run us over
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.000]  not agree it's survival and i want all the listeners to learn from you about street art
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.720]  how you do it how you video it put it up they always flip out and want it banned we've got
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.720]  to move against them and use their weaknesses against them we'll be back with somebody taking

[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.560]  alex jones the foray conspiracy theorist who is a parent

[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.600]  shabo underground street artist provocateur right-wing rebel he's the bad ass behind unsavory
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:00.720]  agents shabo is beating the left at their own game and using every medium at his disposal
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:06.080]  to take back the power monopoly left us have had in the culture war he's been turning heads
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:12.240]  for over a decade giving liberals and progressives hell by any means necessary unsavory agents dot
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:17.520]  com at twitter the new punks and just it just clicked it just hit i'm just going to say it on
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:22.160]  air because i always have these plans and don't follow them through and when i do the few times
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:29.760]  it's always a huge success i want to launch like an info wars information warfare art weaponized
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.720]  system where we sell art to fund the operation categorize a bunch of great artists sell their
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:39.440]  limited works sell all their works ben garrison already wants to do it and then we fund like
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.920]  almost street cores to go out and train people how to do it and find other young artists and
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.400]  then paper the entire country with resistance art that's how the french resistance did it
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.720]  in the few years ahead of taking hitler out you know once the us and then the allies invaded
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.440]  so uh say but we got to get you to town i'm gonna say and get garrison to town because well i keep
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:02.160]  trying to think how do i hire somebody to come in and run this or do it i think you already have
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.360]  proven with your street activism and your talent and uh that that you're the best guy and then
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:12.480]  garrison's great as well we need like to have a partnership we need to launch something big
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.120]  i'm telling you i know when something will crush the enemy as you've already done hundreds and
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:22.240]  hundreds of millions you know of views articles everything you've done uh and the oscar goes the
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:27.360]  biggest pedophile goes to you know that's what you went and you know hung on the outdoor i mean
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:32.000]  the stuff you're doing is devastating them and we need to we need to duplicate what you're doing
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.440]  taking action uh so again if you're a radio listener you're really missing out because we're showing
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:43.200]  this incredible art uh at at info wars dot com four slash show and on streams everywhere and i want
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:49.600]  to get sable backup as much as possible unsavory agents dot com so get into what you do for folks
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.800]  that don't know you what street art is and why it's such a powerful form of resistance because
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:00.640]  even if a lot of our listeners don't think themselves as as as artists again weaponizing what
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:04.480]  you're doing even further what i'm doing what other artists are doing and just simple statements
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:10.560]  or simple memes that are already top memes if we start plastering everywhere with these aggressively
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:16.880]  it will be devastating to the globalists they fear this don't they do all i say is hire me man i
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:23.440]  already have a crew in austin ready to go uh they they recently did that uh a sign that said uh
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:29.280]  austin is a bomb-free zone and i was happy to meet them i was there the other week and uh i was
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:35.120]  checking austin out austin's ready to go man outside of austin pd uh having to stick up their
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:42.080]  butt uh we're ready to go and as far as why it's dangerous it's because it takes a lot of balls
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.880]  to wake up at three o'clock in the morning and do this i love taking a newcomer out with me and
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.600]  the first thing out of their mouth is oh my god i felt like a kid again my heart was pounding
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:57.280]  and uh not very many people are willing to do that but if a 50 year old guy can do it trust me
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:04.320]  you can do it and as you point out we are the avant-garde it's a fact the globalist theorists
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.480]  they know it they have congressional hearings about it talk about there's no way to quantify
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.280]  what you've done but but we'll go through your website show some of these i mean just the devastating
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.240]  ideas you've come up with to counter their hypocrisy their sanctimonious garbage their
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:26.800]  authoritarianism their fascism uh of the sickening hollywood left it's there man uh you know someone
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:33.760]  once said um uh the right has the better product we just have crappy advertising the left has a
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:38.720]  crappy product but amazing advertising and what that means is they have a hold of the narrative
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:46.400]  um for some strange reason every young kid that wants to become an artist just believes that okay
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.680]  well then i'm a leftist and they fall in line with that and they become indoctrinated with that
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:59.840]  and it's like no uh uh there's going to be a i mean i'm subpar when it comes to quality
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:06.160]  and what that means is if i can be great at what i do and still be subpar can you imagine if there
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:12.640]  was an amazing fucking i'm sorry an amazing artist out there uh that's what i'm saying i want to launch
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:19.040]  this whole art operation to do it the street fund it by selling prints and things and then creating
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.520]  schools every quarter where we get the people in show them how to do it legally and lawfully
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.440]  and then deploy them out and then when they do good art we sell it and they make money
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.680]  what because you read the clinton documents at the clinton foundation um that that that that
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.560]  judicial watch and others got and world that daily got they fear us creating our own economies
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.840]  and our own culture like they did with hollywood and the big media well i mean you pretty much
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:49.200]  just outlined my uh the way i do business it's like uh i know a competing crew or two they won't
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.920]  do anything unless they're getting paid it's like no i do it because i've been doing it forever
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.600]  because i believe in what i'm doing fortunately i've got t-shirts and posters that pays the bills
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:07.680]  that gets the art out on the street uh the the missing lynch pin is one we work in a gray area
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:13.120]  there is no legal no there's no illegal i was about to say we tell people the legal way to do it
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.480]  and then of course in an information war whatever they got to do with this petty stuff
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.400]  you know what whatever they do they do because you know the the left's trying to hashtag kill
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.200]  republicans and shoot the scolese and try pouring hot coffee on me all we're going to do is fight
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.640]  their lies because they're kicking us off the web they're kicking us off the internet what they
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:34.720]  really fear is us hitting the street hit the streets man uh i'm not sitting on your chest at
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:40.240]  three o'clock in the morning wake your ass up go do it it's like uh i say ride the wave
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:47.120]  uh what what what i mean by that is um know what's going on in the news and try and uh
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:52.880]  stay relevant in terms of that with your art and uh you know there's a lot of and then the
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.120]  dream is they come try to give you a ticket or arrest you for simply putting a sticker on
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.720]  something and exposing something and now you're all over the news even bigger and instead of
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.960]  selling a hundred posters you sell 10 000 they they know this is the way to bring them down
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:11.280]  you know the secret service knocked on my door man and uh let me tell you that was a very good
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.080]  sales day uh thank you secret service i hope you come back unfortunately i think the next
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:19.760]  time they come back it's going to be with a swat team at three o'clock in the morning
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:25.280]  but but all i can say is uh there's nothing wrong with being notorious if you're notorious uh
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:30.560]  i'd rather be that than famous what about infamous though they're really misrepresenting
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:36.320]  who i am right now i'm trying to make me infamous oh dude you're a legend come on it's like uh look
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.880]  at you you're jacked you've been doing this for a long time it's a beautiful thing because you
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:47.520]  get more reach than anyone else so uh because there's so few people doing what you and i do uh
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.400]  you know that's critical i want to become obsolete everybody else the media like has their secrets
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.600]  i'm trying to give up my little secrets to everybody just like matt drudge tries to tell
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.880]  everybody his secrets we're trying to win this thing well you know what that's a problem with
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.520]  republicans and people on the right uh they just don't want to get involved they don't want to get
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:12.880]  in trouble they don't want to get outed and uh that's what keeps us relevant and uh maybe one day uh
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.400]  you know uh we're saying hey open the gates let everyone do what we do and when that happens
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.440]  we're going to be like oops did we screw up but no it's really hard to do what we do we're going
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.200]  to live in a free country again the globalists are going to shut the door they're coming with
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.960]  authoritarianism they banned you on twitter you have a new account they're coming after everybody
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:36.240]  we are fighting for our lives we must get out of cyberspace and get on to the street and then
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.720]  fire back from the third dimension into cyberspace i don't know who did that here in austin but it's
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:47.760]  terrible you know it is and you know what uh all you have to do is get your butt up on one billboard
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:53.680]  and you'll realize what to do and what not to do uh the first one's always scary the second one's
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:59.120]  kind of scary but you're right jack dorsi the ceo of twitter he wants nothing less than a civil war
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:04.160]  and he wants to destroy us he said that's straight out pretty much and you know what he's not going
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.520]  to destroy us twitter is going to go the way of myspace and by the way the kill the un r a was
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:14.800]  an official one that wasn't street art the companies will take sting take signs saying kill the un r a
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:21.520]  you know and they will um and one has to wonder why i mean why does a company believe
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:27.520]  that they can run with that kind of crap and get away with it it's like uh no we have to show them
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.560]  otherwise and when people see crap like that you know what to do to those billboards folks

[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:37.520]  they were trying to make flu vaccines mandatory as you remember a decade ago and then again
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:42.800]  about seven years ago and i just said hey here's stuff from the inserts saying it can kill you

[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.760]  mainstream news just the last week people that had the uh you know uh measles shots are getting the
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:02.560]  measles and so listers all over put up little posters we printed up people had their own designs
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:07.280]  all over the country they got covered by hundreds of news agencies and we educated a lot of people
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.200]  that's all i'm trying to do stop the globalist so my idea is not even have info wars is some
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:15.360]  centralized thing i just want to have it as a clearinghouse with all these different artists
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:19.440]  shelling their art where they make money they take action but the type of art i want to promote
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:24.240]  is street art that's the type of thing and then you go put it up you show the leftist from a
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:30.080]  hidden car tear it down put that out it goes viral and it's just so many things now what
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:35.360]  a sebo does is is from unservory agents is you know super bold you know up there up on those
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.920]  big billboards the night before the oscars uh and it gets worldwide attention and i'd say
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:44.960]  hundreds of millions of people saw that conservatively uh but the stuff about you know putting it up
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:51.200]  with amy schumer uh the leather special and just making a joke out of it how she got one star which
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:57.440]  is true on netflix so they banned being able to even rate it this guy says he's mediocre boulder dash
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:02.480]  you're doing a great job and it's absolutely exciting to see what you're doing so so sebo
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:08.240]  i'm kind of ranting here and excited uh talk more about what you see happening in this country and
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:14.560]  some of your greatest hits you know man i i love that netflix after i did that amy schumer bit
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:20.560]  they changed the rating system from a star system to a thumbs up thumbs down uh i have people that
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:26.080]  call me up and say hey i have someone in the state department that's going to go uh speak against uh
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:32.320]  who's the one groper guy uh i he was a senator uh well anyways well most of them are groper
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:40.720]  is that matt weinstein uh no the comedian uh how al franken yeah i get phone calls saying hey man i
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:45.040]  have someone in the state department she's going to come out pretty soon so we coordinate i did
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:50.960]  that al franken billboard with them and it's like and we affected some change how much change i had
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:58.880]  a part of i have no idea i just know that uh that went viral it went national and uh and that took
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.720]  that took a lot of balls man i was laying in bed going oh my god someone's going to die tomorrow
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:09.440]  morning i told my crew if you don't want to do this tell me now and they said nope let's do this
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:15.680]  and we practice this over and over and over again until it became a dance and we got that thing up
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:22.000]  there like 15 minutes it was the most beautiful thing in the world it's bold and then and then
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.680]  they don't want to come arrest you or do anything because it gives you so much even more attention
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:32.560]  you know what i don't want to tempt fate it's like someone knocked on my door the other day
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:37.520]  pretending to be with the billboard company asking for some permission to trim a hedge or something
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.280]  and uh it's only a matter of time before the police kick my door down and that's why i'm telling you
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:47.840]  it's critical to get everybody doing this it would bring down the globalist just like i got people to
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:52.400]  go say bill clinton's a rapist and that i mean they're coming after me for it too as well but
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:56.880]  we got to stop them we're men you're a marine i'm a patriot we got to take them on my friend we got
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:04.000]  to do it we got six man join in the water's warm it's like uh well i can't say i've ever climbed
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  up a billboard or rob do has around here i can't say our arts as good as yours but
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:16.720]  it's pretty hideous i'm not a heights guy but uh but you do get used to it it's kind of scary when
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:22.800]  we did those three billboards we put that second billboard up upside down twice i wanted to cry
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:28.400]  it's just an act of god we did not get busted and what you do is you look at something you see
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.480]  the side tire in it you create an image you put it on it but you know there's this low hanging
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.640]  fruit too there's info wars dot com stickers that are all over the country that come in every order
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:41.920]  that people put up and they're just at one point it's still kind of like this they were almost on
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:47.360]  every light pole in austin you think that freaked the establishment out i'm sure it did let me tell
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.440]  you we could do that in hollywood the only reason i don't know everyone's like moved to texas everyone
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:56.720]  loves you in texas is like screw that man i want to be with a fight is i live in in la near hollywood

[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.720]  full weaponized and the way i do it's openly announcing i tell the enemy i'm coming for
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.520]  everybody don't wait for us it's an info war take action they're the enemy they're trying to silence
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:34.960]  all of us come come at me man i'm here i'm here like i said well let's get you on an airplane
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:40.400]  here next week hey set set up the ticket we already have been garrison coming in next week so let's
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.440]  just let's let's get it going here but i think the real thing is funding artists like you helping
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:51.760]  you get platforms teaching other people about uh you know the different tactics uh that can be
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:56.560]  carried out uh where where people won't break the law i think you could write a book or even a manual
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.040]  a little manual we put free in all the orders that explains the continuum of the information
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.600]  warfare resistance but you know it's just like spray paint and v and v for vendetta uh you know
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:09.600]  are things like that that's how we begin to turn the tide if they start seeing our symbols and our
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:16.640]  stuff in every town every city it will be unstoppable i'm ready to take action well great i'm happy
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:22.480]  you're all jacked up i'm jacked up as well all i can say is 2020 is going to be the biggest zoo
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:28.480]  political zoo we have ever seen and uh you know uh people on the right have a choice they could
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.040]  tuck their tails and run which i think many of them will or we could just double down because
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:39.120]  let me tell you the left has doubled down and and what you just said is absolutely on target
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.440]  i'm not giving up i feel super excited they're coming out for more than ever and it just makes
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:49.520]  me get up off my ass and take the gloves off dude they stole my g i went and did a hit on facebook
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.960]  and chuck schumer the other weekend while i was gone unfortunately i guess i must have projected
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.840]  that i was out of town they came to my apartment stole my jeep that thing is stripped right now
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.320]  it's in the shop right now getting all the fluids taken out now i get it brother we all take one
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.800]  for the team but that's why we're americans and it is so exciting and i'm telling you it's already
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:15.120]  coming together we need to get a serious plan we need to launch the operation just about funding it
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:20.320]  and the education about information warfare with street art i'm telling you that is where
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:25.440]  we really go operational you're like a general in this we don't need you leading the commando
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.400]  teams we need to get everybody out there doing it then maybe we videotape on these undercover groups
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:35.200]  it's not gonna be me and you or anything going up on the billboards at night and other things
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:43.680]  yeah let me tell you man until my body decides to give up my ass will be up on that billboard
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:50.720]  and i understand uh for legal reasons i'm not supposed to say that but but um i'm having fun

[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.240]  now is the time to go in and to hammer them hard and that's why they're scared of you because
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:17.680]  they're trying to demonize me with made-up stuff how do you demonize somebody that's an
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.000]  artist that only makes them bigger histories happening and that's why they know that it's
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.480]  been artists and minstrels and things that have brought down many a king we need to defend the

[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:09.200]  their president is another hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:14.720]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president to
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:21.840]  endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:28.240]  and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:34.720]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs

[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:45.040]  twitter twitter just shut down my account i had 32 000 people which i know to a guy like you
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:50.000]  doesn't sound like a lot but i don't have a pr person i don't try to get people no that's

[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:06.560]  why they did it don't get me wrong they had a thousand reasons to throw me off of twitter
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:12.960]  but uh they didn't tell me one and uh and like i said jack dorsi the other day the CEO of twitter
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:19.680]  said we need a new civil war and the right needs to die so if i was a stockholder in twitter i would
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:24.400]  worry and try and throw that guy out because he ain't right that's right they're getting very
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.840]  very aggressive they're out of control well listen i'm gonna have rob dude call you because here's
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:32.000]  the deal i i'm not procrastinating anymore but soros breathing down my neck all these fake
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.760]  lawsuits that we can get thrown out the media misrepresenting what i've said about sandy hook
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:39.200]  editing it the listeners of every four years say i believe it happened and then they just keep
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:43.600]  saying jones is being sued because he says it didn't happen well there's a one-year statute
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.920]  of limitations and i never even said i was sure it didn't happen but they were crisis actors
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.760]  i said people are saying it let's look at it and i said you know what i can't say that they're
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:57.120]  actors i can't say it's fake so now the media is misrepresenting who i am what i've done
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:01.520]  and soros funded groups are suing me and it's the number one story in the country right now
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:06.480]  not the neocons pushing for war uh not them trying to remove trump not the illegal judge
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:12.560]  the the officiated soros is wetting raiding the trump's lawyer uh not all this crazy news no
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:17.520]  ladies and gentlemen it's alex jones is being mean to the sandy hook victims he's a bad man he
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:21.760]  needs to be kicked off the air he needs to go to president he needs to be shut up why do they
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.960]  fear us so much we'll talk about it more any other comments let's say bob we need a gloria
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:33.200]  all red of the right to publicly sue everyone that throws us off of these social networks
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:38.480]  and everything else where the hell is our gloria all red well that's why you're here i would say
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:43.280]  to the crew we need to fight back we need to get art on the streets we need to get in the streets

[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:59.760]  simple plan at first and then expand out from there and just to create again a culture and a market

[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:08.720]  speaking to you soon thank you very much man i appreciate you having me on you bet i'm excited

[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.800]  the globalists are getting threatening they're getting abusive they're coming after us we have
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:25.200]  to stand up we have to take action now joining us is millie weaver our intrepid reporter who
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:31.920]  loves to work on the road with her great cameraman and editor gabin winch and last night she called
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:37.360]  me very excited the video is now on info wars dot com me too movement assaults conservative woman
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.600]  for asking questions about the clinton's and their history of sexual assault
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:50.400]  and we're going to let her break down what happened at akron university in ohio last night
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.680]  right and then what happened once she went outside the video is chilling how the feminist
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:01.600]  movement funded by soros mainly the whole women's march led by the islamist uh lindesor sir whose
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:06.320]  mother writes papers on general mutilation and then the women were obviously watching outside
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:11.120]  what millie was doing inside and a mob of women showed up to go after her so this is what they
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:15.280]  think well like hillary said these dumb white women vote like their husbands say funny it's
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:20.880]  mainly white women i see leading all the feminist bizarreness in pushing racism and sexism this is
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.440]  just weaponized media millie great job as usual for radio listeners break down what happened
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.120]  then we come back from break we're going to play some of the shocking excerpts we have to
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:34.720]  bleep a lot of it obviously but uh of what happened last night well alex i was actually
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:41.120]  pretty surprised i was hoping to get a more cordial respectful answer out of torana berg
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:47.360]  at her speech yesterday at the university of akron but instead i got a vulgar irate
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:55.840]  disrespectful response from her she told me to shut up she said for me to sit my ass down
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.760]  she was very disrespectful the minute she realized that i was questioning her
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:08.400]  the on the hashtag me too movement and just simply saying hey why were these other women
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.960]  excluded why were they not included in the hashtag me too movement and the women i was
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:18.960]  referencing were the women that came out with allegations against bill clinton we know paula
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:26.960]  jones cathleen willey um and wanita broadreck who was the main one who came out with allegations
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:34.080]  that bill clinton violently raped her and even bit her lip damaging her face so basically
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:41.920]  torana berg got really upset when i asked about the possibility of the hashtag me too movement
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:46.800]  becoming too partisan and being used as a political weapon and if you know essentially
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:52.240]  that was going to take away from the mission which is to help victims of sexual assault
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:59.840]  which immediately then she turned nasty was like oh well i wonder who you voted for and just suck her
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:05.760]  mob audience on me with this mob-like mentality that all started cheering her on and you know
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:13.280]  supporting her in trying to bully and intimidate me into silence which then her mic holder ripped
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:19.200]  the mic out of my hand to silence me so i couldn't even respond to her and then they had security
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:24.800]  come and escort me out because you know they couldn't handle me there and also the lady who
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:30.640]  was operating the mic tried to steal my camera from me and i had to literally fight the camera
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:38.480]  away from her and this is the thing these progressive sjw liberal women they get mad when they don't
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:42.800]  like what you're saying and they try to rip your phone out of your hand that also happened to me
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:50.160]  again after i left the building and a mob of protesters came out i wasn't even sure what it
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:56.800]  was about because their banner said take back the night so as i'm approaching it i start getting
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:03.280]  flipped off and having women yelling at me and that's when i realized wait a second this is the
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.840]  hashtag me too movement and they were probably observing in a separate room because they were
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:13.200]  streaming the video to other rooms and that's when i realized oh my gosh you know these are
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:20.560]  these women are irate they're very mad at me um essentially tyrannoburg gave them permission because
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:27.040]  they had all established rapport with her she did a really good job throughout the the meeting the
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:31.440]  the speech to make everyone established rapport with her and seeming like she's just trying to
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:37.920]  help everyone and she's just this woman i could say this tyranus tyranus burk uh torana burk
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.480]  and these women we haven't played the video yet it's coming up in the next segment they're just
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.880]  so vicious they're so hateful and you're a woman i guess you went in there without your camera person
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:52.160]  by yourself and then they've obviously been been trained and ready for somebody to try to come in
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:57.120]  and this is how they act like vicious entitled arrogant piranhas the universities have turned
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:04.080]  into these anti-free speech bullying dens just like the university uh there at georgetown suing me
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:10.400]  lying about what happened uh there in charlottesville where you were covering it that's right this is
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:16.080]  about censorship see they made a huge deal about any time a conservative speaker was going to speak
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:21.760]  at a university you have these big protests and essentially they shut down that person's right
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:26.640]  to speak because the universities no longer want to let them hold their speaking events there because
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:32.240]  they want to avoid conflict now were there any conservatives out there protesting and silencing
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:38.240]  this speaker tyranoburg and her hashtag tag me too movement no there weren't there were not protesters
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:43.520]  see conservatives respect the right of free speech and people to have differing opinions
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:48.320]  now all i did i did not disrupt i wasn't bird dogging i wasn't trying to disrupt her no

[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.320]  products you need survival shield x2 is simply amazing millie just briefly tell folks a little
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.800]  bit about survival shield x2 and some of the other products i know you're a fan well you know
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:05.840]  you without iodine you know your body is going to become iodine deficient and that's what survival
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:13.040]  x2 is about it's iodine really good quality iodine and even the doctors the dentist knew back
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:19.600]  then that our bodies need iodine there used to be a huge goiter epidemic that's what the goiter
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:25.440]  goiter belt was all about and they started giving people you know iodine to treat goiter and it
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:31.360]  instantly would reverse the goiter they used to have to give school children the iodine to
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:37.360]  reverse goiter and essentially they noticed that iq's went up even after giving them iodine so
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:43.840]  our bodies need iodine studies have shown that pregnant women who are deficient in iodine end
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:50.000]  up having children with lower iq's and what i what i will say my own self personally i took iodine
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  i took iodine throughout my pregnancy and my son is way above average so i i advocate for it i know
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.680]  a lot of women that you know iodine and survival shield x2 has changed their lives it's helped
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:09.600]  them hormonally in many ways so i definitely advocate for it and by the way notice all the
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:14.960]  headlines about women thyroid issues record numbers even young women uh getting goiter and
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:18.640]  they don't tell you hey it's because you don't have iodine most of the time they go here's some
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:23.680]  special thyroid medication and all the rest of it and again folks consult your physician but they
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:27.360]  won't tell people that are getting a lot of old people have bad absorption they don't tell them
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:32.640]  their skins opening up their teeth are falling out because they have scurvy because the doctors won't
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:37.920]  tell them that you need vitamin c to live i mean it's like water water everywhere not a drop to drink

[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:48.480]  meat two movements uh basically encourage this vicious crowd to assault a female reporter we're
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:59.600]  going to play some of this incredible footage right now here it is don't touch me don't make my phone
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:08.560]  do not against outside of here putting me on this damn lie go ahead and end this damn real quick no seriously game i talk to rena burk is the founder of the
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:16.400]  hashtag me too movement the movement claims to be inclusive of all victims of sexual assault
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:24.320]  however some victims have felt left out and even ignored by the movement she came to akron university
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:34.720]  to speak so i went and asked her these questions paula jones cathleen willey and wanita broadrick
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:42.640]  all came out with sexual allegations against bill clinton decades ago they originated this
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:49.280]  idea of coming out against someone who's powerful but they came out before these other women came
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:55.680]  out against harvey weinstein now why were they excluded from the hashtag me too movement they
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:54:02.240]  weren't they were not included in the time magazine article none of the women were interviewed
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:12.480]  do you are you worried at all that the hashtag me too movement may become too partisan and be used
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:21.440]  as a political weapon back in a minute they're saying who did you vote for so the whole point is
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:25.600]  they're making it partisan the woman marches over start trying to take the microphone i want to point
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:31.520]  out you went up you asked the question they gave you the microphone you did this the proper way
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:35.680]  before this all descends because remember we're also a radio show that's why i'm narrating that
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:39.280]  for tv viewers are saying why is he telling us what we just saw i'm narrating for radio listeners
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:43.440]  we're going to keep playing this but uh i can hear the tremor in your voice because these women
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:49.840]  start to look at you like they want to kill you oh yeah i mean it became a den of vipers and she
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:55.120]  sure sucked them on me i mean they instantly started cheering with her and it became a big
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:01.920]  bullying fest and it's like this witch hunt this mob mentality where somebody can incite violence
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:07.760]  or hate towards you instantly and that's exactly what she did that's right uh let's continue meli
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:13.040]  well let's continue with the video are you worried at all that the hashtag me too movement
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.880]  may become too partisan and be used as a political weapon
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:23.920]  no no so
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:27.120]  what about
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:36.240]  no no what about what about bobby and williams who is an african-american woman that said bill
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:44.400]  clinton pregnant her and justice for daddy williams the answer is this is not a partisan movement
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:48.400]  come on the answer is if you want to talk about before bill clinton let's talk about i mean the
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:54.960]  hell come on oh he asked her out and that was even proven that's that's the same as rape
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:01.280]  i'm raising awareness i am raising awareness bill clinton if you want to talk about war
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:06.480]  war clinton got uh settled those cases
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.760]  it was but meli we're going to come back to break and play more they're always only making it about
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:21.040]  republican candidates and they ignore it when it's democrats so why is it that her answer
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:26.400]  wasn't just simply you know we do support those women and we do think that you know the allegations
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:31.520]  against bill clinton are appalling and we want to support them and extend an arm to them and by the
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:35.760]  way notice meli at first a lot of women at first a lot of women cheer you but then they get the
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:40.160]  marching orders that they shouldn't exactly what you said was very reasonable she should have just
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:45.440]  said you were right that'd be it that would have been it but instead she decided to deflect and say
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:50.880]  well let's talk about roy more let's talk about you know these other men but the reality is i never
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:58.160]  said anything to to disinvalidate any of room or any of that or even disrespect her i just simply
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:03.840]  asked her as the founder of the me too movement you know if she was going to support those women
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:08.960]  that came out against bill clinton and if she was concerned if it was going more partisan and being
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:14.800]  used as a political weapon and instead she decided to turn the audience on me and be very immature
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:21.120]  and you'll see here at the end here when she says that you know i need to just shut my ass up and
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:25.120]  sit down you know like we're gonna come back with that on the other side of this break in the next
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:30.640]  hour meli weaver's our guest and again the whole me too movement was founded to cover up hollywood
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:35.200]  and the democrats and what they've done and to make consensual sex or asking a girl out the
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:40.000]  same as raping a woman and hillary clinton representing child molesters and rapists and

[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:42.080]  talk about consent like why can't i ask questions about why some women have been excluded you guys
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:46.880]  are jumping to sister though did i say i was against her calling around on other bulls when
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:52.720]  you needed to learn about the survivor look all she could you know what she could have missed the whole point of
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:58.000]  she should have just literally said we support those women too shut your mouth i thought all
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.960]  women were worried about being said and i wanted to know why they weren't being worried about the
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:07.680]  topic that had to include all of them she doesn't have to that's not what she didn't include the
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:16.720]  the fat one of the attacks to include all of them she doesn't have to that's you about why didn't

[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.680]  of protesters came out to come and accost me and yell at me and so here's why the feed cut
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:43.320]  But one of the freaking crazy triggered liberals ripped my phone out of my hand.
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:46.320]  No, don't come back over to me again.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:48.360]  This is the girl that took my phone.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:49.360]  No.
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:50.360]  Pause again.
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:51.360]  They're in a public place in a demonstration.
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:52.800]  They come over to her.
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:53.800]  She dares speak back.
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:54.800]  They're like, leave us alone.
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:55.800]  We're victims.
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:56.800]  Crap!
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:57.800]  It's always the same.
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:58.800]  Here, continue.
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:03:59.800]  Get away from me.
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:00.800]  What's your name?
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:01.800]  D. Millieweaver.
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:02.800]  Okay, good.
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:07.800]  I'm just, make sure, just make sure, do it one more time.
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:11.800]  You're the one who's trying to come into my camera.
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:14.800]  They're coming at her and then saying, don't videotape.
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:17.800]  This girl's harassing me and trying to attack me.
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:22.800]  She literally grabbed my phone from me and she keeps coming up to me and threatening
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:23.800]  me.
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:27.800]  Literally, she keeps coming up to me trying to attack me.
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:30.800]  I've had to tell her, please stop.
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:35.800]  I guess this is what happens when you just come out to universities and ask questions.
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:47.800]  You have to be escorted back to your car by police because people can't act like adults.
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:48.800]  There are the bullies everywhere.
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:51.800]  They got sorrows trying to shut Info Wars down.
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:53.800]  What are we going to do?
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:55.800]  We're going to fight.
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:00.800]  Info Wars Life is launching its newest product, we're really, really proud of it.
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:08.800]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber and it's got the very best concentrated fibers from

[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:31.800]  other products.

[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:23.800]  Hi.
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:24.800]  I'm a jury.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:25.800]  I'm a jury.
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:26.800]  I'm a jury.
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:27.800]  I'm a jury.
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:28.800]  I'm a jury.
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:29.800]  I'm a jury.
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:30.800]  I'm a jury.
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:34.800]  The jury is going to look at the 20, 20 marching orders as an officer.
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:38.800]  The Soros group funded by his son Alexander Soros and it was how they worked in 2015,
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:43.800]  particular documents, and how they would drill as actors how much breaking and things they
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:44.800]  would do.
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:48.800]  They would work with the Blue City Police first in Democrat areas.
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:54.960]  attack. So they could bring in civil emergency, martial law, that term is used, and bring
[02:06:54.960 --> 02:07:00.680]  in the strong cities initiative where the UN, the Justice Department, would take control
[02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:04.880]  of the United States. Now that's mainstream news. We can play the video clips of Loretta
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:11.040]  Lynch saying it. The magnitude is too incredible. Okay. Now the Starbucks, who told everybody
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:15.640]  to have sensitivity training a few years ago and white employees should apologize to
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:19.320]  black people and say they're racist, try to buy coffee. I'm like, I'll take a medium
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:23.000]  coffee. I'm sorry. I'm white and I'm racist and everybody like flipped out and said that's
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:29.400]  insane. So now Starbucks with the social engineering work with the ADL in double ACP, the Justice
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:35.960]  Initiative directed by Attorney General Eric Holder, former U.S. Attorney General to then
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:40.240]  go in and have everybody have sensitivity training from the ADL. So they're turning
[02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:44.920]  them into ADL agents basically to then say gun owners are bad, veterans are bad. I mean,
[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:49.880]  it's all about un-American activities. And then you've got Millie Weaver. They're in
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:56.240]  Akron, Ohio at the university. The video is up on info.vores.com. And she gets up and
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:59.560]  asks about Bill Clinton and Hillary and their whole history of sexual abuse and settling
[02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:03.360]  things and why the Me Too movement just goes after Republicans and doesn't point out that
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:07.560]  it's bipartisan and all the rest of it. They send the police. She's agreeing to leave.
[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:13.560]  They grab her. She's thrown out the woman that gave her the microphone to speak. Looks
[02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:18.560]  like she was trying to grab the phone. I saw that. She goes outside, women come over and
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:22.920]  get in her face, try to take her phone, kill her live feed, try to follow her out in the
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:28.120]  parking lot. She's got to get a police escort. And that's what happens. That's what these
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:32.560]  folks do. And so Millie, I just wanted you to be able to put bookends on this because
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:37.160]  it just shows the hysteria they've created. These are the universities. This is what the
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:45.080]  establishment wants. This is the weaponized youth, the hysterical, entitled youth that's
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:50.560]  led by Linda Sorcerer that thinks women should have their genitals cut off or her mother promotes
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:56.360]  it. And George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, and the same Me Too movement is funded by
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:01.240]  Soros funds the March for Our Lives movement. It's all admitted. And when I say that, the
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:05.320]  news goes, you're saying the Parkland students were actors and weren't really there and no
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:10.120]  one died. No, I'm saying they're PR people chosen because they're anti-gun. We got to
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:13.680]  go to Zach here in just a minute or two. He's only got 20 minutes with us with an emergency
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:17.880]  report on what's going on, but just a final bookend, Millie.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:23.040]  Well, what I got out of this whole thing is that essentially the left is going to be
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:27.360]  able to continue censoring conservatives at universities, whether they're a speaker or
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:31.400]  whether they're just somebody there trying to ask questions at one of their events.
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:36.400]  And if we don't start standing up and doing something about it, well, too bad because
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:40.520]  the squeaky wheel gets the oil. That's why they have essentially banned conservative
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.840]  speakers from universities because let this go out and throw a temper tantrum every time
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:48.960]  a conservative speaker comes. That's why we need to get out there and vote during the
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:54.680]  midterm elections. Look, if these people get their hands on the power switches in our country,
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:10:00.360]  we are doomed. They don't care about free speech. They will send witch mobs on you. They've
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:04.920]  done it to me. Why would they hesitate to do it to anyone else? That's really what
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:09.480]  I got out of this whole thing, Alex. And it's just one of their tactics like what that
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:13.520]  girl did. She jumped in front of my camera to then pretty much threaten me that if I
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:19.200]  didn't stop filming her, she was going to assault me. This is a tactic they use to try
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:24.560]  and silence you. This is all about silencing conservatives. We've been watching this massive
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:30.600]  purge on Twitter and social media. And by the way, the red elephants was also banned recently
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:36.840]  from Twitter as well as Sabo. So it's a purge that's happening right now on our social media
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:42.520]  platforms as well as on universities. Thank you, Billy Weaver. Great job. Godspeed. Thank
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:50.640]  you. Now, joining us until about 40 after or so is Zach. He is a high level intelligence
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:55.720]  source known by name to me. He's been on national TV. He's been in newspapers many times. Zach's
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:59.320]  real name. The government knows who he is. He said the FBI can pick him up twice over
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.320]  what he's covered. But at higher levels, he's now been basically released to tell the truth.
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:09.280]  He concurred with our sources inside the hostage rescue team in the FBI the day after the still
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:16.840]  unsolved situation in Vegas that that was a internal Saudi civil war operation. And
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:21.440]  then it was a gun deal gone bad that the Saudis that came into town use the gun deal with
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:24.760]  a guy that already bought guns from to get in there and get weapons they couldn't bring
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:30.960]  in on aircraft. Now, to give us all the latest developments that unfold and to discuss the
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:36.000]  civil war going on inside the White House that we talked about last week that he talked
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.040]  about on Friday, that they planned more strikes and sanctions. People said, Oh, Zach's wrong.
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:45.280]  They said limited. Then you learned a few days later, they want more strikes. They want
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:49.480]  to put trips on the Russian border. They want confrontation. All of that confirmed out of
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:54.320]  Centcom. And now Zach has traveled to the West Coast to learn more. So we've got a lot
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:58.880]  of articles to go over here with him that tie into this. He can't get anything classified.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:02.920]  He just as a citizen can give you his breakdown. But Matt has won a congressional approval
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:09.680]  before striking Syria. He was overruled. Again, because your security clearance downgraded.
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:14.400]  We've got the Saudi Crown Prince boasted that Jerry Kushner was in his pocket. All this
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:17.680]  nexus is together. Zach, thank you for joining us.
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:22.080]  Yes, it's great to be back on and be able to connect some dots here. Obviously a lot
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:28.040]  of moving pieces, but yeah, just to get right into it. The idea that this strike was for
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.080]  North Korean consumption and to kind of, you know, pressure them and to do whatever they're
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:35.600]  doing is completely ridiculous. That deal with North Korea was already signed months
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:40.400]  ago as we spoke about it. Everybody already knows. And the idea that North Korea has lost
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:45.520]  fire is unaware that the might we have as a military or the idea that we might go to
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:48.560]  war with the country is completely crazy. That has nothing to do with not to mention
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:52.400]  the fact that we have just about a hundred thousand troops currently permanently stationed
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:58.640]  around their country. The idea that we would strike a sovereign country to do that is so
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:02.720]  problematic in its thinking that I don't even know what to do. Because what we got here is
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:06.720]  this, folks. Listen, I'm a huge Donald J. Trump fan. There's just no question about it. Donald
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:11.680]  J. Trump is the most effective president in US history. And he has done incredible things.
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:15.680]  But this is not a professional sports team. We don't have blind trust. Okay. It's not,
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:19.680]  I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan. And no matter what the record is, I stick with them year and year
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:23.520]  out. Well, sure. Nikki Haley is openly in rebellion against the White House,
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:29.840]  shooting her mouth off and they're out of control. We cannot have blind trust, not me, not you,
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:33.280]  not Donald Trump. The only thing we can have blind trust in is the Republic of the United
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:37.760]  States and the upholding of the Constitution. So he's done a lot of great things. And obviously,
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:41.520]  I'm a huge supporter of him. And I did everything I could to get him elected over Hillary Clinton.
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:46.800]  But what happened in Syria was so problematic. And in the covering up and the conspiratorial
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:52.560]  thinking of why he did this, oh, it's only limited. Trust the plan is wrong. This is not it. If
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:57.040]  you're going to be in Syria, okay, and bombing something, why don't you bomb some ISIS strongholds?
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:01.840]  Why don't you bomb some ISIS fighters? He comes out and addresses the nation and says,
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:08.320]  we specifically attack Assad sites, Assad sites, the same sites the Russians have been protecting
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:12.000]  with their blood and treasure for years. You don't come out and say that. Okay. He called
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.240]  them an animal leading up in the days up into it. This isn't about ISIS. This isn't about some, you
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:21.840]  know, that was signaling, trying to kick off a new war in the Middle East and try to get Russia to
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:27.280]  respond. That's what I pick up. 100%. Mattis, Mattis didn't want it. The military didn't want it.
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:30.720]  They said, you got to go to, you got to go to Congress for this. But obviously, there's,
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:34.560]  there's some different thinking there. Trump, he's a smart guy. He weighs all of his options.
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:38.480]  And in the last minute, he made a choice. And now the question becomes, why did he make that
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:42.960]  choice? And to me, it's very obvious. I believe a deal was struck. In fact, I know it deal was
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:47.600]  struck with the Saudi Arabians. Remember, everybody, the very first Trump, the very first
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:52.080]  trip that Donald Trump made as the president of our country. Where was that to? Right in the
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:57.360]  Saudi Arabia, waving the swords right in the riyadh. Okay. Now, while Donald Trump was, you know,
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:01.600]  doing all that, you know, making deals kind of on camera, signing everything, making a mistake,
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:07.200]  Jared Kushner, okay, had already had these deals drawn up. Jared Kushner was in their
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:14.480]  wheeling and dealing, guaranteeing Syria in Assad to the crown prince. He guaranteed that in exchange
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:20.400]  for prolonged weapons planning and by our prolonged weapons plans being sold, different systems,
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:25.040]  different weapons systems are, are, are, are support of them doing and taking over the Middle
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:29.760]  East. Yeah, $300 billion. And Trump likes that. He likes to get jobs for America. When we come
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:34.160]  back, let's talk about the rest of the story with Zach, who's a great source on the other side and
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:39.680]  tie it into everything. I mean, that's why I got mad on Friday. My gut was this was part of a huge
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:44.480]  double cross and a shakeup inside the White House in attempt to start a wider war. Then I tried to
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:48.400]  back off of that and say, well, maybe it's about North Korea, maybe it's limited. But now you see
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:56.480]  it's not. There's a big schism, a civil war inside the White House. You have been lied to.
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:03.440]  My name is Kevin Ship. I'm a former decorated CIA officer. Finally, someone has come out and written
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:08.640]  what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever. We're in a constitutional crisis
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:13.520]  and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government. We got to get this out
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:17.360]  because just because you're awake folks doesn't mean other people are. This is critical to get to

[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:30.240]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. I don't like to get up here and talk about World War III or a new
[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:36.080]  world war, but if you look at what the West has been doing, it's encircling Russia. It's siding
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:43.120]  with radical jihadists. It is doing horrible, horrible things. And five years ago, our military,
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:47.360]  if you just tuned in, said no to Obama, no to the globalists. General Dempsey went and said,
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:52.320]  we're not doing this. We're going to back the Russians going in. Assad's made a deal to have
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:56.880]  elections after they're beaten. And Assad still says he'll do that. Trump says, that's a great
[02:20:56.880 --> 02:21:01.120]  idea. I'm all for that. He gets briefed by the military, who basically asked him to run for
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:05.680]  office two years before he does. This was already in the works. Because Trump, you know,
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:09.360]  kept trying to organize other people to resist this. So that's why I got so mad at Trump,
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:13.600]  was because I went home and thought it wasn't going to happen, because Matt had said it wasn't
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:18.640]  going to happen. And then recklessly, he gets countermanded, obviously. And Trump gets convinced
[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:24.720]  to do it by Bolton or some other loon. And we're off to the races. And I didn't know the Russians
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:28.640]  were going to respond. They didn't. They stood down. And I guess it's because of behind the scenes,
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:32.080]  our military's telling them, hey, we're trying to stop this. That's what I already had. But we've
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:36.160]  got, Zach has got a lot of great sources. And again, I know who Zach is. Zach, tell us, am I
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:40.800]  accurate when I said, or what's really going on? What's the latest? What's unfolding is Trump
[02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:44.960]  becoming compromised with the right on his lawyer. That's what I was thinking. Or did he just get
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:49.200]  manipulated by the neocons? Why is Haley now stomping around like she's the president,
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:52.560]  acting all arrogant and attacking the White House? This doesn't look good.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.680]  Yeah, absolutely. You're right on several issues there. And there's several moving parts
[02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:02.160]  that are all contributing to this. So yes, the rate on Cohen's office was very problematic,
[02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:07.440]  because like we discussed earlier, Jared Kushner in that meeting, that first, that inaugural
[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:11.680]  trip to Saudi Arabia, there's some very troubling recordings that will be out there and everyone
[02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:16.560]  knows and everyone is just going to be out there. By the way, you said that Friday, I'm sorry, you
[02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:21.600]  said that Friday. I just forget how awesome you are. I have the article, you said that Friday,
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:26.160]  it's now in the news saying there's recordings that he said that. So you broke that here.
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:32.240]  Well, yes, absolutely. I mean, he's in uncertain terms, he basically promising the head of Assad
[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:36.400]  to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, which is obviously problematic and treasonous on a constitutional
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:42.240]  level. But why do you think, and we could pull it up, Jared Kushner, the capacity that he's at in
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:47.120]  the White House, had his security clearance downgraded. So he no longer gets the daily
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:54.880]  intelligence briefings that he was reading and digesting every day, because Jared got sloppy.
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:23:00.000]  Jared started shooting his mouth off and selling certain information essentially overseas. And
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:06.160]  you don't get your security clearance downgraded for no reason. There's obviously a reason behind
[02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:09.840]  there. And it's become obvious with some of the recordings that are out there. And obviously he
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:13.920]  had his security clearance downgraded. That's a major concern that just was news one day.
[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:17.840]  And then it's just, oh, no big deal. On to the next thing. But when it comes to this strike,
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:21.920]  obviously this happens. And then when you see the disruption with Nikki Haley,
[02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:26.720]  we did this six months ago. I told you, Taylor was compromised. Haley was compromised. Sessions
[02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:31.760]  is compromised. I understand what the other side is saying in the intelligence communities and
[02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:36.720]  in the Q and A community. It's my opinion that Sessions is compromised. Haley is compromised
[02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:39.840]  and Tillerson is compromised. That's been my line for six months, not sticking to it.
[02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:43.200]  And they keep saying stick with the plan. Just because Q and A puts out some stuff,
[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:48.000]  that's true. And I know you know who those guys are. This isn't a plan now. We're getting off
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:51.360]  the Trump plan. And I like Bill Medjali's coming on next week, but he says, well,
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:55.440]  there are people that support an agenda. So they supported Trump. And there are people that support
[02:23:55.440 --> 02:24:00.800]  Trump. No, I support Trump and the agenda he originally promoted that lined up with reality
[02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:05.520]  and what I supported. I won't support him if he goes sideways. So I understand all this really
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:11.360]  started around when around the Breitbart issue, excuse me, not Breitbart, right around, right around
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:17.600]  when Nikki Haley, right around when Nikki Haley started running her mouth and doing her own foreign
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:21.520]  policy here. Nikki Haley and the plan is, this is it folks. I don't know if anybody's looking
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:24.880]  into this, but this is definitely the plan. Nikki Haley is looking to run in 2020 with Mike
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:29.280]  Pence. They're hoping that in this raid, and they have probable, they have probable cause here,
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:33.440]  if they go after this witch hunt to actually impeach Donald Trump, if they could, if they could
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:37.600]  pull it off. And they're, they're planning internally for Donald Trump to be impeached
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:40.880]  and Nikki Haley and Mike Pence to run on that 2020 ticket. You keep caring.
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:46.240]  And notice Saturday Night Live and all of them for months are acting like Pence is perfect.
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:50.640]  He's the guy. And now the headlines are today that Haley and Pence are trying to line it up
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:56.320]  behind the scenes. Very, very wicked behavior, if true. Absolutely. And very, very dangerous
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:01.680]  behavior. I mean, listen, well, notice how the media always says Pence is perfect and Pence could
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:06.720]  do a wrong and he navigated it perfectly. They're going to burn Pence as soon as he flushes Trump.
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:10.720]  He better not be stupid. Exactly. And this all happened with the Breyfark.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.320]  Haley, Steve Bannon, you know, left the White House. Everybody picked their sides right then
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:20.320]  and there. Trump came out and then notice he announces his 2020 run and he knew what was going
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:25.600]  on. But the issue is when you have several, several compromising issues, what do you do here?
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:30.560]  And in this case, obviously the initial trip to Saudi Arabia, he's fully aware of what Jared
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:33.920]  Kushner is doing, but he got in over his head and he had a security clearance downgraded.
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:38.080]  They have promised, and whether you like it or not, they have promised a sod's head to the
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:42.080]  Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. And why do we care in America? We really should care because this is
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:47.120]  the continuation of empire building, the military industrial complex flexing its muscles as hard
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:52.480]  as possible. And for all the good that Trump stood, I'm really, really surprised by this and I'm not
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:57.360]  sure exactly what is behind the scenes that really got him to do it. But there's a couple things
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:02.000]  that are reasons for concern that I could see him doing this. And the recordings are one of them.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.160]  Jared Kushner promised it there. And, you know, it's no surprise when it comes to 9, when it came
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:11.200]  to 911, a majority of those hijackers in the funding all came out of Saudi Arabia. We, you know,
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:16.480]  they're turning over, they're becoming, you know, more modernized. At the end of the day,
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:21.360]  this has been a very cozy problematic relationship that's been based in money, oil, and blood for
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:27.280]  quite some time. Well, I know the Saudis looked like they were in ecstasy when Trump was over there
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:30.560]  and they claimed they're going to stop funding their terror groups. And so just because one
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:34.560]  faction of the Saudis got rounded up, doesn't mean the more powerful faction was really just
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:39.120]  the same group. And that's all part of that super deceptive stuff that they engage in over there
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:44.640]  that causes so many of their political long-term problems. But I totally agree with you, Zach.
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:51.360]  And here's the thing. Trump is dealing with very dangerous people that want power and who want to
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:55.120]  bring him down. And the globalists hate Trump because he's America first. He's done a lot of
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:59.760]  great work. And he has to know that they're never going to stop till they destroy him.
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:04.160]  And people like Pence and Haley also want to hedge their bets behind the scenes claiming that
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:08.160]  they're really against Trump. So I think there's some survival instinct there. The real survival
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:14.160]  instinct is to double down on Trump and support him as long as he follows the original agenda,
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:18.320]  because again, once the left gets Trump out of there, they are going to go after everybody.
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:23.680]  They are loaded for bear. They are crazed. They know that we're pulling America out of their
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:28.160]  jaws. And so they are on a death mission right now. They call it a death battle.
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:34.160]  Absolutely. And Nikki Haley engaging in this in this Russian trash talk is just ridiculous
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:37.840]  coming out of a Trump White House saying, you know, you know, addressing the UN,
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:42.560]  looking at the Russian. Who do you think wrote those tweets calling Assad an animal and you're
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:47.680]  guilty and I mean, all this ridiculous crap. Calling an animal were locked and loaded.
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:53.440]  She reiterates, I don't get confused. It's obvious. The script's written. They're hoping for an
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:59.440]  impeachment internally. They tried to pull off the 25th on 45. That didn't work. He had resolved
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:03.600]  there. The wheels came off on Russiagate. Now they've rated his lawyer. There's not a lot there.
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:07.520]  They're desperate. They're desperate. They got some stuff in that raid. They got some stuff in
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:11.680]  that raid. Not, not, I mean, to me, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter. But
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:15.760]  for the nitpicking impeachment process, they're going to draw that out because you can call it
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:19.040]  money laundering. If somebody use, you know, campaign money that people paid through to
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:22.880]  launder it, you know, to pay off some bimbo. Exactly. It's, it's incredible.
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:28.640]  Exactly. And what happens about the next Syrian chemical attack? So, so what do we think here?
[02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:33.840]  Oh, wow, that was affected. So based off of fake intelligence, a fake, a completely fake video,
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:38.480]  we, we, we bomb them. That's the, that's the, the pretext to do that. So what happens when there
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:42.960]  is the next chemical attack? We must respond again, correct? Because if I was, if I was not a fan of
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:47.600]  Bashar al-Assad, I would be doing everything in my power to set off anything in that country
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:51.760]  because it's going to guarantee- Sure. So let's briefly talk about how Trump saves the bacon
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:57.760]  in the country. We'll be back with Zach, final segment. Hear that? That's the sound of a house
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:04.880]  being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[02:29:55.840 --> 02:29:59.440]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine,
[02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:03.440]  introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new,
[02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:08.800]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and
[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:16.080]  sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France
[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:21.440]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:26.400]  responses. They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later,
[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:31.760]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:37.840]  seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:42.160]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:47.840]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.

[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:25.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:29.840]  All right, Zach's got to go in like 10 minutes. I got a plug. We talked to the factory. There's only
[02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:34.080]  so much deep breath crystals left on the X-Tube. It's only happened one other time. I'm hoping to
[02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:39.040]  get more of it. They've put us over to Barrel at the oil companies where we try to get the
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:43.600]  derivatives of this. It's the purest eye-down in the world from 7 to 12,000 feet. I hope we can get
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:48.560]  more. One time, we couldn't get it for eight months. And then when we could, they jacked the price up.
[02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:53.920]  So we have got enough for two more big runs. They're doing an emergency run right now. So
[02:33:53.920 --> 02:33:58.480]  more is coming in a couple of weeks. So I'm going to keep the sale going 25% off and just keep it
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:03.680]  going until we sell out. And then we'll have maybe a run and a half left because we're doing a half
[02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:08.240]  run right now. And again, I'm paying a lot more, but we're keeping the price low for you. The good
[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:14.400]  halogen, learn all about it, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or triple eight, 253-3139.
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:17.040]  And Zach, I want to get into the big enchilada we were discussing
[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:22.240]  here in the break. Just lay out in that three minutes what you were telling me because it's
[02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:26.960]  absolutely on target about where we are right now. And the American people need to be very
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:31.760]  aggressive, very vocal, very focused after you tell them what you're about to tell them because
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:34.480]  the deep state is getting ready to make their move on the president. Go ahead and tell them.
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:40.400]  Absolutely. I mean, what's going on right now is a very entrenched internal conflict to it,
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:44.560]  to have our president impeach and have him double cross by Haley and Pence in their power
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:49.840]  structure there. And this is an internal battle that has been waged momentum-wise,
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:53.920]  that's John Kennedy at his brain blown out there. That's the type of event,
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:57.920]  the type of thrust-like event of a space rocket, of a spaceship taken off. I mean,
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:02.880]  if you're going to be that bold, be that bold, that's a Kennedy, you're going to have generational
[02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:07.440]  individuals in that chain of command all the way up to what we're dealing with right now.
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:12.080]  And Donald Trump is in the fight for his life, in the fight for the republic. This is it.
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:17.920]  This is it. He has to double down. He has to do whatever he can to expose them, not by time,
[02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:22.160]  because they are coming for him and they are going to put him in vulnerable situations to
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:26.080]  either be impeached or executed. It's just going to happen. The writing's on the wall. There's
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:29.920]  internal conflict which is in his own chain of command immediately, let alone what's going on
[02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:34.720]  behind the scenes. We cannot let this happen. He needs to double down. Where are the military
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:40.240]  tribunals really going after the deep state? Do not appease them because they will not give you
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:43.360]  an inch. They're coming for your neck. That's all there is to it. They're coming for you.
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:47.360]  You know, I studied the Nazis and the Soviets. Now, there's always this mental illness,
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:52.480]  this arrogance, but when you look at the globalist, they all have the sickness of this arrogance.
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:55.760]  Trump, you can see it's a strength, a mission. It's the opposite of strength. With them,
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:36:01.920]  they all look so wimpy. They're so condescending. They're so sanctimonious and they're so arrogant.
[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:07.440]  This Soros judge that rated his lawyer and all of it, and it's like all the crimes they've committed,
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:11.600]  are they really sanctimonious? Are they really on a power trip or is it really an act? They're
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:15.680]  scared and they're acting powerful. I just know this. I got Soros in the globalist. You can see
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:22.160]  Zach. I'm as big an enemy now as Trump. Give me your calculation on why they're so trying to get
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:29.680]  me right now lying about me misrepresenting, trying to destroy me right now. For the remarks
[02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:36.080]  that you made on Friday, they know that you have a blind allegiance to the truth, to the Constitution,
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:40.080]  and for all the good that Donald Trump did, you still came out and said, this is unacceptable,
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:45.280]  that this is a bad sign, because it was your thinking, your base, and this sort of
[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:53.200]  person. It's taken on a personality of itself. It has a life of itself. It's Americana is what
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:58.800]  it is. It's the revitalization, the revolution, the second American revolution. You are the speaker
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:03.440]  for that. And regardless, especially now, I expect you would think you would get some slack by
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:07.360]  speaking out a little bit here. Not going against Trump, but calling out what he did. You would
[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:11.360]  think you would get some slack. I see it as the opposite, because I can see, no, you're not paid
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:15.600]  out. And yes, you're real, because you're going to hold the line of truth. By the way, I didn't say
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:19.760]  that to get him off my back. You notice they accelerated that suit and followed on Monday.
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:23.760]  No, no, absolutely. I know they got even more pissed when I did that, because I'm not selling out.
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:27.760]  I'm never selling out. And they hate the fact that our audience isn't selling out. And they just
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:32.240]  don't like info wars as people like you and countless others come on. They don't like anybody
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:37.120]  having a voice. Exactly. And I just want to let people know, I mean, all the attacks are fine.
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:42.720]  This is not about a record. This is not about blind adherence. This is about the Second American
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:47.520]  Revolution. I'm wishing the best for Donald Trump. I really do pray for him every day. I want him to
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:51.920]  do well, but I understand he's in the fight for his life. It does not make you un-American or
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:57.360]  unpatriotic to know the forecast, see the storm coming, and let people know. It does make you
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:02.000]  un-American and unpatriotic to know the forecast. Let the storm wipe everything out and act like
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:06.000]  you don't know what's going on. That's ridiculous. So when this thing happened in Syria, I thought
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.000]  it was a very bad sign. I knew it was a very bad sign. And we have to support the president. We
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:14.080]  have to double down and really support him because I agree. Everybody has to call Congress,
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:19.840]  call talk radio, call everything, and say attack politically. It's time. And by the way,
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:24.480]  this just broke in full wars.com. Finally, GOP demands criminal investigation to Clinton Lynch,
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:29.280]  Comey, evidence conspiracy to overthrow duly elected president, surfacing. They now have all
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:33.760]  of the McCabe emails, all of it proving that Comey lied to Congress about the Justice Department
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:39.680]  not being involved. That his investigation was by itself. They have them. And Trump has to fire now.
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:44.080]  We have them dead in the sights. We have them. He cannot wait. If this is the real moment of
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:48.320]  truth, I'm not backing down. I feel great. I mean, I actually feel like I'm now spilling into the
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:53.520]  shoes of my forebears. I'm so alive. I'm sorry. I actually love all this. And I don't, and I'm not
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:57.840]  somebody that's into satan masochism. No, I don't like pain, but I like victory. And I like not
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:01.440]  being a slave. And these globalists are evil. So they have this letter. We'll cover it more
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:07.440]  after Zach leaves. It's on info wars.com. But Zach looking at this and looking at the left and
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:12.560]  looking at how they're weaponizing, how they're building up, how they're doing all this, people
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:16.560]  have to know that they're going to take everything when they're done. Hillary was planning to get
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:21.200]  rid of free speech, implode the economy, reeducate America. They had it all lined up with all the
[02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:26.720]  big corporations, the sensitivity training, the ADL, the Southern Bobby Law Center. There are
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:30.560]  still going ahead with the plan, but we're fighting back. And that's what I'm going to tell the
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:35.840]  globalists. They're insane. They could have stopped, regrouped, backed off, maybe come back later.
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:40.320]  The fact that they're hard charging in now, trying to intimidate us and only thinking one
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:44.320]  dimensionally, that's why I feel so good. No matter what happens to me or Trump,
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:48.800]  I can tell you right now or Matt Drudge or any other patriot, we're winning. And now Tucker
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:55.760]  Carlson and, and, and now, uh, uh, Ingram and, and now Rand Paul coming out saying false flag and
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:01.120]  this is bull that doesn't make sense. You can see that people out there have light of justice in
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:06.320]  their eyes and that good knows their kids have no future if we don't stand against this. The only
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:10.800]  way we lose folks is rolling over. And those of us that are under attack, I gotta be men. And once
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:15.600]  you get past the fear, there's not fear. It's good. There's no more fear. I don't fear anything they
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:20.000]  do to me. And it's not as I'm a hero. I know they're bad. We've got to face them down. Go ahead.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:26.240]  Absolutely. First things first, we have got to warn and sound the alarm on the next chemical
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:30.080]  attack that will occur in Syria. Cause it's just obvious thinking, of course, if you, if you were
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:34.160]  not a Bashar al-Assad fan, you'd be doing everything in your power to set something off in that
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:40.080]  country. So when and if that does happen, we have got to guarantee that it gets tested,
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:44.160]  that we have people go evaluate what would really happen, that the intelligence is verified,
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:48.960]  and that we have an approval on a secondary strike because one's coming. If you don't think that,
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:52.880]  you know, that's just ridiculous thinking. It's coming guaranteed. So when that happens,
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:55.760]  we have to make sure that we don't pull the trigger, you know, get right in there with
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:59.840]  that. And Trump knows that and he's trying to act like, let's just say it, it looks like Trump has
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:04.320]  gone along with the plan to make it look like he's being reasonable to cross red lines. And then,
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:07.840]  and then when the rebels cross it for him, we're going to attack and take out a side,
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:11.520]  betraying everything Trump said he would do and turn the country over to be broken up,
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:15.440]  occupied by Saudi Arabia. So every non radical gets murdered and tortured to death.
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:20.640]  Exactly. And they have a nice little line saying, Oh, there'll be there'll be an army
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:24.320]  comprised of Arab countries taking care of Syria that US is going to pull out. Whoa,
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:28.000]  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean an army comprised of Arab countries?
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:33.120]  That's an invasion force just like they did before an army. There's a Syrian army. It's
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:37.600]  a sovereign country. We're not taking our army out and putting another army in. That's called
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:41.040]  Libya. That's called Afghanistan. That's called everything else. And by the way, the Syrians
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:46.640]  will fight. I mean, look at the civil war. They just fight. They're going to continue to fight.
[02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:52.560]  They're in the fight for the life every single day. I mean, it's every single day could be your
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:57.360]  last day on earth there. So they're dead serious about it. We need to get serious about it. This
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:02.480]  is the perpetual momentum of the military industrial complex and the intelligence agencies
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:06.320]  since John F. Kennedy's brains have been blown out in the back of that Cadillac. This is it.
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:12.080]  This is everything. This is 9 11. This is golf of Tonkin. This is Vietnam. This is everything is
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:15.840]  leading up to this moment where we have got to back our president and really get through to him
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:19.520]  and say, do what you can because this is it. We're not going to have another Donald Trump in
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:24.160]  office. God knows what follows behind Donald Trump, but it will not be the chance that we have now.
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:28.720]  We must seize the moment. That's right. Syria is the last domino and then it goes into war with
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:33.440]  Russia the whole nine yards. They've got it planned. Jack, come back as soon as you can to give us
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:36.880]  more briefings. Yeah, I know you got to go. You got to go. If you want to add any other points,
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:41.040]  you can hold over. You got to go. That's it. Yeah, I got to go. Thank you very much. I know
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:44.640]  you're at your lunch. There goes Zach. We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen on the other side.
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:49.600]  What a time to be alive toe to toe with Nazi collaborator George Soros running the deep
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:53.440]  state breakaway group. Time to start World War three. Pray to Jesus for peace.
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:59.680]  Mike in Arizona. You're on the air worldwide. Go ahead. Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:04.640]  week. Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:09.280]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:15.840]  And as a long time info wars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:20.480]  anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the anthroplex. Thank you. I use the
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:25.120]  bio true selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who are big, normal toothpaste fans.
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:30.000]  The super blue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the info wars life products.
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:35.040]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing that for us to

[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:50.000]  houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:58.880]  Feel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by info wars life.
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:03.280]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability
[02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:07.920]  of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components. They also help prevent
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:12.320]  discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:44:12.320 --> 02:44:16.800]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age. Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:22.240]  those naturally present in the body. Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:27.040]  You can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:31.520]  commonly associated with high meat diets. Just one pill with every high protein meal
[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:36.800]  helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:42.640]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:48.160]  fully digest all types of meals. Don't let a meal go to waste. Use carnivore by info wars life.

[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:10.400]  it takes hours. Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.

[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:54.400]  And it's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:26.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are anti-American. They're anti-free market. They're ultra-rich, but they want you to be poor.
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:37.400]  And they've been running major psyops against me for 20 years, but in the last three, as everybody knows, for the middle of the campaign till now, it's been intense.
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:51.400]  And I learned that they know I'm so truthful and the globalists respect me so much. And I'm not saying that as a power trip. I've only learned this recently that they believe everything I say.
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:59.400]  And I'm right most of the time. I'm wrong sometimes. But the whole Sandy Hook secret is this.
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:10.400]  And I'll go ahead and say it all on air. The whole truth is nothing but the truth. They thought because I backed off saying I didn't think all of Sandy Hook was real.
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:20.400]  I never said they were all crisis actors. I never said nobody, you know, died. I said I could see how people believe that and because people have been lied to so much, but they edited those tapes together.
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:35.400]  But if I thought really it was all staged, nobody died, I'd say it. And you all saw them with the whole thing a couple months ago on Valentine's Day, the tragic event in Parkland, say that I said nobody died.
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:49.400]  They were crisis actors. No, I said they chose Democrat kids, young people, who were already anti-gun and would already did, you know, internships at CNN and who were in the art department, in the acting department, in the drama department.
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:57.400]  To then be chosen as the spokesperson of the anti-gun and funded by Soros. That's all admitted. But they misrepresented.
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:08.400]  But in the case of Sandy Hook, early on, I just saw another mass shooting and then there's a guy in the woods with a gun and another guy and then the news said we made that up.
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:16.400]  There wasn't a guy on helicopter in the woods and we saw the news. They said forget about that. And there wasn't a police drill that day.
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:26.400]  And so there's a bunch of anomalies. And so my listeners went, look, these are crisis actors. And look, this guy's laughing and now this guy's, you know, crying in space of seconds.
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:34.400]  And I said, well, her parents can do that. Then I said, you know, I can see how there's dead babies and, you know, incubators that didn't exist, the people questioned. You have a right to.
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:39.400]  So they took the fact that I wargamed it and didn't really even demonize me at the time.
[02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:46.400]  And then Paul Watson about six months after it said, look, I like working for info or since the only time Paul's ever done it.
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:53.400]  But he said, this is bull. These groups that say it's crisis actors. If you noticed, they also say you're Jeff Bridges and they say you're Bill Hicks.
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:59.400]  That was like five years ago. We laugh at that. But these people believe that. And I went, yeah, it's crazy.
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:05.400]  And then the very groups would get mad at me because I wouldn't constantly harp on Sandy Hook and say I knew it was fake for sure.
[02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:12.400]  So about a year after I started saying, you know, I can see how you think nobody died, but you know what, I think it happened.
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:19.400]  And I'm not going to sit there and look at parents and say it, you know, that it didn't school shootings happen. Are the Democrats seizing on it, blaming the Second Amendment?
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:28.400]  You bet. And everybody's heard me that's been listening since a lot of you've been listening for five years, some of you 20 years, but mostly have been listening, you know, just for a year or so.
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:41.400]  You've heard me what, every week they got articles saying I say nobody died and they've always got new ones. Jones just said nobody died last week and they'll show some edited three year old clip or four year old clip.
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:52.400]  So I get what happened. They saw me kind of entertain it. It was viral all over the Internet, hundreds of millions of views just on our videos discussing it.
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:51:05.400]  YouTube deleted them. And then I started saying, you know, I think people died there because I was getting threatened by people that said nobody died and being saying I was involved.
[02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:13.400]  And I went, this is a little bit schizophrenic. And so Paul, who I really trust and who's just as smart as I am or smarter, he said, you got to get away from this.
[02:51:13.400 --> 02:51:20.400]  Don't even entertain it. They're nuts. Don't even have debates. I went and told my crew, I said, I don't tell you what to do most of the time, but I said, you stay away from the Sandy Hook.
[02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:30.400]  This is like four years ago. And the media saw that and they went, he's weak. They think I'm like a sociopath like them. But then I tell the truth.
[02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:38.400]  And so they went, oh, we got him. Jones is saying it happened and stopped saying it didn't. He backed off. We got him. He admits he's wrong.
[02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:50.400]  And I went, no, I just entertained all the angles because government staged stuff before. So we have a right in Aurora. The guy was in a DARPA program with his dad. And there were other shooters and a stand down was ordered. And the guy says he was drugged up by the government.
[02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:58.400]  And then he was a pat seat. That was in the local news, but never got national news. I'm saying Aurora was staged. I don't know exactly how, but we know.
[02:51:58.400 --> 02:52:09.400]  So they'll take me talking about a roar or other events, edit it together deceptively. And then just every day, it's the same story. You've seen it. It's going to be one of the most reported stories ever of fake news, a giant hoax.
[02:52:09.400 --> 02:52:19.400]  And see, this is good for me and you and everybody to understand the anatomy of how fake news works because you've been listening a long time. You've heard me say over and over again. I believe people died at Sandy Hook.
[02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:32.400]  I was unequivocal last year, a year ago with Megan Kelly. She edited, she kept arguing me about it, saying, well, why did you question it before? So I would say, well, this and that, then they would have my, why are you saying no kids died?
[02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:45.400]  And it would cut to me going. Remember, I recorded it. She takes something from 10 minutes before put together. Well, it's because of the green screen and Anderson Cooper or, well, I have a right to, they were just editing it together to deceive.
[02:52:45.400 --> 02:53:04.400]  Because they somehow think because I developed my ideas on this and pulled away from even really overall questioning it for some weird anomalies to move on because they've built their whole house of cards on this to where Alex Jones is the Sandy Hook didn't happen guy.
[02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:18.400]  So then they follow this lawsuit Monday. They send a letter, they say, retract this or we're going to sue. That's last Thursday. On Monday, they sue. It's not even statutory. It gets the suit thrown out.
[02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:30.400]  That's what my lawyers don't even know what to do. It's like all misspelled and wrong names and defamation of people that said nothing about Sandy Hook, just wrong reporters names and he'll kick Daniels and we're not even sure at that point.
[02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:38.400]  I guess that's people they can find to do stuff like this is lawyers like that. And then the lawyers are all over defaming me in the news saying things I didn't say.
[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:48.400]  And then the lawsuit deals with us saying we get why people have questions because they keep changing their stories. But I think that's because the media keeps trying to get people to go with talking points.
[02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:56.400]  It doesn't mean the event didn't happen. Doesn't even mean they're liars. Maybe it's the way Megan Kelly changes the interviews because they all the parents are saying we couldn't see our kids for a long time.
[02:53:56.400 --> 02:54:08.400]  We didn't see him that day. And we're told, you know, dropping the kid off and he had his book bag, picked him up in a body bag and saw the holes in him and all this that day.
[02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:16.400]  And then maybe that's how Megan Kelly interviewed it. Maybe that's how she edited it. But it doesn't matter. They're betting it all on that because they think you're stupid.
[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:25.400]  Kind of like the black guy goes into Starbucks and says, I heard your racist give me a free coffee. And so she gives it to him because she goes, oh, I kind of heard about that. Yeah, we're racist. We're sorry.
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:34.400]  And it's because people weren't buying things weren't wanting to use the bathroom. We're staying in the place and got thrown out. They'll throw a white guy out. They'll throw a black guy out.
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:44.400]  And by the way, you can tell it was all staged. Not that guy, but the guys that got arrested. They come and say, I want to use the bathroom. Sorry, it's for, you know, customers.
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:51.400]  Can I use the bathroom? I'm not a customer. Well, if you asked us to use it, I thought you were a customer, you could, but no, I technically can't because you're saying you're not a customer.
[02:54:51.400 --> 02:55:02.400]  Okay, well, I'm a sit here. Trying to like relive Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks really got told her out the back of the bus. And that was horrible. Blacks really got told they couldn't go in certain hotels or lunch counters.
[02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:13.400]  That's not going on now. So it's a whole thing by the Justice Department, by the Clintons, by the globalist to kind of re kick all this off. And that's what this all is, is we can't call Alex racist. That doesn't work.
[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:24.400]  Can't call him a Russian. That thing's falling apart. We'll just say he's mean to the victims of mass shooting. And they said that you saw him a few months ago about what happened in Florida.
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:35.400]  And they tried to get me kicked off the air with that. Didn't work as it wasn't true. So they're back again now recycling what I didn't really say from five years ago, because they think you're stupid.
[02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:47.400]  But AP got it right. Actually quoted me saying, you know, that Jones for years, it says he did think it happened. And that he'd love to have the parents on the discuss and have a real discussion about guns, blah, blah, blah.
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:58.400]  And then it goes into what AP said that the lawyers said I said, which isn't even in the suit, which isn't even what I did. So that's what this is. Just trying to try me in the court of public opinion. But here's the deal.
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:12.400]  I'm going to go on to the end as Churchill said, whatever the cost may be. And we've got record traffic. We have got people buying a lot of product. And the way it squares up and looks, we're going to be able to beat these suits, get them thrown out.
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:22.400]  They're just we're just having to get a war room together in house council. So I don't have to worry about it. And we just move on. We got to counter sue all the people obviously for the anti slapback provisions.
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:31.400]  And we were already filed one of those last week in DC. I'm doing what I said I do because we got to let people know when they do these, we got to hit them back so that you obviously we stop it.
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:43.400]  And there's going to be more coming. And if they can get us, they're going to use it as the president, all these other media cowards that, you know, want to stay out of this, you're going to destroy yourselves by staying out of it.
[02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:50.400]  I want to thank everybody that has stood with us. And I appreciate the audience, Drudge report, my family, the great crew we've got. Thank you all.
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:57:00.400]  Speaking of that, we've got some of the biggest sales ever, 50% off the real red pill, 50% off alpha power, even though that sold out in like two weeks. We've got 25% off X2.
[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:08.400]  Like I said, we're going to have to stop that sale, but they're going to get us a rush, a medium size order. But the problem is we're running out of this particular supply.
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:20.400]  We can't find another one so far. They're jacking up the prices on us at the mines. It's done with gas drilling really. I see the world really. It's gas drilling. They get the pure crystals at 7 to 12,000 feet. Amazing.
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:27.400]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy. Learn about what pure iodine does. X2, you can still get it, but not for long, unfortunately. We may be able to get another supply, but we're trying.
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:40.400]  But we're searching, ever searching for other supplies. It was them trying to shut us down before with another supply that wasn't even as good. Let us do this. Revolutionize this whole thing. We'll be back with Roger Stone.
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:44.400]  I'm going to ride shotgun on big issues. Stay with us.
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:57.400]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield.
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:08.400]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer.
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:20.400]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:31.400]  You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you.
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:40.400]  The remnant of America to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:58:40.400 --> 02:59:04.400]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield in FullWarsLife.com. After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids. One of them is a powerful pro digestive enzyme carnivore for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:20.400]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration. And we also have an everyday extremely affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance.
[02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:30.400]  But all of these are the very cutting edge top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:45.400]  That is my goal here is to bring you the very best at the lowest price. When you purchase it in FullWarsLife.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:00:00.400 --> 03:00:15.400]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.400 --> 03:00:30.400]  I'm going to ride shotgun for the next 20, 30 minutes with Roger Stone and then he's got all the stuff he's going to be covering. But I got to tell you, we got Rand Paul out saying, looks like Syria was a false flag. We got Nikki Haley and everybody basically involved in mutiny against the president.
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:40.400]  Looks like as soon as John Bolton got in there and things started getting real bad. Now they've told the rebels stage another chemical attack. Trump will remove Assad.
[03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:51.400]  They've got the president's lawyer rated. And now all of a sudden Russia gates gone. Now the media is like we're going to get you for paying off broads.
[03:00:51.400 --> 03:01:03.400]  But Comey can cover up all the pedophilia of the Clintons and the Epstein aircraft and. But finally, GOP demands criminal investigation into Clinton.
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:12.400]  Lynch and Comey evidence of conspiracy to overthrow newly elected president servicing Congress reports.
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:21.400]  Well, that's the action we need representative Matt Gates. So I know you've really helped and pushed among 11 members of people sign on the Declaration of Independence.
[03:01:21.400 --> 03:01:33.400]  Let me tell you, they are signing their death warrant. We don't win. They have a lot of courage who want to investigation into violations concerning everything from the anti Trump Steal dossier funding, the handling of Clinton's email probe, the uranium one scandal.
[03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:40.400]  Everybody else is playing it safe. We're going to read more of the article in the letter to Congress in the next segment. This is a short segment, but Roger Stone.
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:50.400]  I tell you, this sounds like the cavalry. Can we play the cavalry, you know, maybe in the next segment coming in over the hill, maybe John Wayne and the cavalry charge.
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:02:00.400]  Because this feels like they do sex cavalry or you have some Millennium Falcon coming in episode four right when Darth Vader is about to kill Skywalker and just taking those babies out.
[03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:02.400]  I mean, this is what we knew you didn't it's done.
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:19.400]  No, Alex, it's time for the cavalry. I mean, how long is the cover up of the egregious crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas and their attempts to actually use the power of the state, the surveillance authority and power and capability of the state to hijack.
[03:02:19.400 --> 03:02:32.400]  To hijack American presidential election. And they want to talk about Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, when there's no evidence of collusion or a crime, when the crime is right under our noses trying to overturn the election.
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:39.400]  And as you always said, once they thought they found something, the Russia drag net goes and it all turns into the new thing they found.
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:50.400]  What is it they think they've dug up in the president's private lawyer file that the judge, Soros' judge that married Soros, said putting a federal database so all the feds can get in it and leak it safely.
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:53.400]  That woman should be instantly indicted. What a lunatic.
[03:02:53.400 --> 03:03:01.400]  Yeah, you're speaking, of course, of Judge Kimba Wood, who I know extremely well actually spent a weekend with her socially one time.
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:03.400]  Nice lady.
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:04.400]  Oh, you know her extremely well.
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:07.400]  Well, she's a she is someone I know.
[03:03:07.400 --> 03:03:09.400]  Well, the word is she's kind of wild like you.
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:19.400]  So she's actually it's been a surprisingly independent jurist and sometimes hands the government decisions that shock them.
[03:03:19.400 --> 03:03:20.400]  So we're back to this thing.
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:22.400]  Bolton's good as you drink whiskey with him.
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:23.400]  No, I'm not.
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:24.400]  I'm not.
[03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:25.400]  I'm the sheriff's OK as you got him elected.
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:27.400]  I'm not mad at you, but now this lady's good.
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:28.400]  She's to be a playboy, Bonnie.
[03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:29.400]  She likes to have fun.
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:31.400]  Not saying anything of the kind.
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:35.400]  She may be in the tank for for the Clintons and the Obama.
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:37.400]  Hey, just because she's a rowdy girl that loves life.
[03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:39.400]  I'm not putting her down for that.
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:41.400]  You know, it's kind of like a famous movie.
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:43.400]  That's a great mirror of reality.
[03:03:43.400 --> 03:03:46.400]  Caddyshack is like Lacey has a certain zest for life.
[03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:48.400]  I'm not going to say a word, Judge.
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:49.400]  Good.
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:50.400]  Very good.
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:52.400]  But the issue is, is her is her activity?
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:53.400]  Sorry.
[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:54.400]  Go ahead.
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:04:03.400]  Look, I don't know how this comes out, but the new focus on Michael Cohn is clearly built around the fact that he apparently,
[03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:10.400]  or at least allegedly, acted to silence a number of women who had extramarital relations with Donald Trump.
[03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:14.400]  Now, the difference between the president and, say, Bill Clinton is,
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:18.400]  at least those relations were consensual, which you could not say.
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:21.400]  He wasn't raping a woman and biting her face in a cloakroom.
[03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:22.400]  You know what?
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:28.400]  At 3% growth in the economy on the cusp of a peace deal in North Korea,
[03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:29.400]  no one cares.
[03:04:29.400 --> 03:04:30.400]  They don't care.
[03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:33.400]  That's where I think the deep state is making a mistake.
[03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:37.400]  I think with Trump and all those Miss America contests sitting there with the girls,
[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:39.400]  I mean, you can tell what's going on there.
[03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:42.400]  I mean, you know, the problem is the president's not a pedophile.
[03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:43.400]  If he was, they'd love him.
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:44.400]  He's not in the club, folks.
[03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:47.400]  And he's not in the little kids.
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:50.400]  Of course, they don't, they see, if you're even in the little girls, that's bad with the left.
[03:04:50.400 --> 03:04:51.400]  You got to be in the little boys.
[03:04:51.400 --> 03:04:52.400]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:52.400 --> 03:04:53.400]  Stay with us.
[03:04:53.400 --> 03:05:00.400]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWarsLife.
[03:05:23.400 --> 03:05:29.400]  It is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:34.400]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:05:34.400 --> 03:05:39.400]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[03:05:39.400 --> 03:05:42.400]  species and other free radicals.

[03:06:17.400 --> 03:06:27.400]  You've got Comey, who ever did the clothing makeover for him.
[03:06:27.400 --> 03:06:35.400]  Wearing the most gangsterous black shirt with this light gray jacket, like right out of Casino Central Casting.
[03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:36.400]  And who was he on with?
[03:06:36.400 --> 03:06:37.400]  Colbert?
[03:06:37.400 --> 03:06:38.400]  I saw a clip this morning.
[03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:39.400]  Who was he on with?
[03:06:39.400 --> 03:06:40.400]  Kimmel?
[03:06:40.400 --> 03:06:41.400]  Guys?
[03:06:41.400 --> 03:06:42.400]  Colbert?
[03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:45.400]  Well, let's pull it up on screen just as a fashion guy.
[03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:48.400]  Roger Stone has to say about him.
[03:06:48.400 --> 03:06:53.400]  But what do you make of Comey, whose whole family voted for the Clintons, who protected the Clintons,
[03:06:53.400 --> 03:06:56.400]  who knew he was going to get in trouble for protecting him, reopening the investigation,
[03:06:56.400 --> 03:06:58.400]  in case Trump won, just a fool, Trump?
[03:06:58.400 --> 03:07:01.400]  But Comey, I'm not a Republican.
[03:07:01.400 --> 03:07:05.400]  What do you make of, I mean, obviously, tell us something we didn't know.
[03:07:05.400 --> 03:07:06.400]  You're also a globalist.
[03:07:06.400 --> 03:07:07.400]  You're not a patriot.
[03:07:07.400 --> 03:07:09.400]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:07:09.400 --> 03:07:11.400]  How do they think they're going to get away with it?
[03:07:11.400 --> 03:07:18.400]  And what do you make of this and what do you make of the BreakingInfoWars.com story by Jamie White,
[03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:22.400]  finally GOP demands criminal investigation into Clinton Lynch and Comey?
[03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:24.400]  We're going to read part of that letter in a moment.
[03:07:24.400 --> 03:07:29.400]  First of all, Alex, I want to remind all the info warriors in the greater New York City area
[03:07:29.400 --> 03:07:35.400]  that there is a protest today outside the Barnes and Noble and Union Square,
[03:07:35.400 --> 03:07:39.400]  where Lion Jim Comey has his first book signing.
[03:07:39.400 --> 03:07:45.400]  This is a peaceful protest where we are going to seek to bring public attention to the leaking
[03:07:45.400 --> 03:07:48.400]  and lying and illegal acts of Jim Comey.
[03:07:48.400 --> 03:07:51.400]  So if you're in the area, come on down.
[03:07:51.400 --> 03:07:53.400]  There's going to be a lot of great info warriors there.
[03:07:53.400 --> 03:07:56.400]  And we look forward to you joining us.
[03:07:56.400 --> 03:07:58.400]  And by the way, let me just add this.
[03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:01.400]  We need to get you in one of these lines, at least have them throw you out,
[03:08:01.400 --> 03:08:05.400]  but go up there and videotape, you know, you have someone with a cell phone beside you,
[03:08:05.400 --> 03:08:10.400]  and go up and say, here I am, buddy, you're the one with Mueller on tarmacs with uranium.
[03:08:10.400 --> 03:08:13.400]  You're the Russian agent, you piece of filth.
[03:08:13.400 --> 03:08:16.400]  Well, you know, you sound like Laura Loomer.
[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:19.400]  She wants me to do exactly the same thing.
[03:08:19.400 --> 03:08:20.400]  I'm game.
[03:08:20.400 --> 03:08:26.400]  I'm watching this book tour very carefully, Alex, because I am going to show up at some of them.
[03:08:26.400 --> 03:08:28.400]  Jim Comey needs to be confronted.
[03:08:28.400 --> 03:08:31.400]  I mean, here's a guy who testifies under oath when he's asked,
[03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:35.400]  have you ever anonymously leaked information to the media?
[03:08:35.400 --> 03:08:36.400]  He says, no.
[03:08:36.400 --> 03:08:42.400]  Then he goes on to say elsewhere that, sure, I gave my notes from my conversation with the president
[03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:47.400]  to a friend and had him give them the friend, give them to the New York Times.
[03:08:47.400 --> 03:08:50.400]  So in other words, he leaked and lied about it.
[03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:58.400]  Jim Comey, this is a guy who holds himself up as some kind of epitome or a paragon of integrity.
[03:08:58.400 --> 03:09:07.400]  And as far as his makeover, one of Stone's rules, your shirt should never be darker than your tie.
[03:09:07.400 --> 03:09:09.400]  The guy looks like Al Capone.
[03:09:09.400 --> 03:09:11.400]  I mean, what is that all about?
[03:09:11.400 --> 03:09:16.400]  He did the same thing with George Stephanopoulos coming on in an open collar shirt.
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:18.400]  No, you're not a regular guy, Jim.
[03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:20.400]  Don't try to convince us that you are.
[03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:21.400]  You're a stiff.
[03:09:21.400 --> 03:09:26.400]  And he's been a legal executioner for both the Clintons and the Bushes.
[03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:28.400]  Of course, he's not a Republican.
[03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:30.400]  He's a deep stator is what he is.
[03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:32.400]  His allegiance is to the deep state.
[03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:36.400]  The deep state, as you know, Alex, knows no party.
[03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:38.400]  It knows no party.
[03:09:42.400 --> 03:09:47.400]  What do you make of this letter that 11 brave members of Congress have sent to Comey?
[03:09:47.400 --> 03:09:49.400]  That's got to certainly scare him.
[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:56.400]  I think, you know, again, kudos to Matt Gates, who I think is a very courageous member of Congress.
[03:09:56.400 --> 03:10:03.400]  As you know, Alex, usually freshman, congressman, younger congressmen are expected to be seen and not heard.
[03:10:03.400 --> 03:10:05.400]  Pay your dues to the system.
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:06.400]  Don't rock the boat.
[03:10:06.400 --> 03:10:08.400]  Maybe you can climb the ladder.
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:15.400]  There's a handful of guys like Matt Gates and Jim Jordan, others who know why they went to Congress,
[03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:24.400]  who went there to make waves, to get something done, to draw attention to the abuses under the Clintons and the Bushes.
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:30.400]  So I think this letter is not only a great idea, but it is very good news.
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:37.400]  It's time, and you've been saying this now for some weeks, to stop talking defensively about Russia and all,
[03:10:37.400 --> 03:10:45.400]  and Stormy Daniels and this nonsense, and talk about the egregious crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas.
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:53.400]  This is President Obama who sold weapons to ISIS, or gave them to ISIS, I'm not certain, and then lied about it.
[03:10:53.400 --> 03:11:00.400]  This is a crew, collectively, who attempted to steal an American presidential.
[03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:02.400]  And by the way, that's what the letter says from Congress,
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:07.400]  evidence of conspiracy and overthrow of the elected president, surfacing, we've got it in triplicate.
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:09.400]  I want to get back to that just briefly.
[03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:15.400]  Number one story on Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook, Alex Jones says no kids died at Sandy Hook.
[03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:20.400]  When for years I've said I believe they die, the lawsuit says I just said that.
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:21.400]  I haven't said that.
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:26.400]  Years ago, I played devil's advocate in debates and said I could see how in the government lied about babies and incubators
[03:11:26.400 --> 03:11:29.400]  and all the rest of it, that people could say they're lying again.
[03:11:29.400 --> 03:11:30.400]  I could see that.
[03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:32.400]  But I don't think that in this.
[03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:38.400]  The media is in a hoax saying I've said this, and then now they've sued me when it's going to come out in court.
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:39.400]  What's going on?
[03:11:39.400 --> 03:11:45.400]  You can go back five years ago when I was kind of entertaining it, but there's a statute of limitations to a year.
[03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:49.400]  I've not said that even ever, but I mean, they are really afraid of info wars.
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:51.400]  They are apoplectic.
[03:11:51.400 --> 03:11:54.400]  They have gone into crazy town mode.
[03:11:54.400 --> 03:12:00.400]  No, look, Alex, I'm surprised when they go out there and they distort the things that I say.
[03:12:00.400 --> 03:12:11.400]  But the treatment you've gotten over the last 60 days with this series of orchestrated, phony, baseless, outrageous, but expensive lawsuits
[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:23.400]  is clearly a coordinated effort to silence you and to give the internet mavens the rationale for taking away your voice.
[03:12:23.400 --> 03:12:27.400]  And then to set the precedent and to expand on that, I know the main thing.
[03:12:27.400 --> 03:12:30.400]  They don't like me pointing out that George Soros is a Nazi collaborator.
[03:12:30.400 --> 03:12:34.400]  So they've got Sink saying he fought Hitler and, you know, defeated him.
[03:12:34.400 --> 03:12:41.400]  And they've got all, you know, Anderson Cooper saying that he's actually Captain America and severed, you know, his head and that Soros actually killed Hitler himself.
[03:12:41.400 --> 03:12:44.400]  I'm being sarcastic, but they say he wasn't a Nazi sympathizer.
[03:12:44.400 --> 03:12:48.400]  When the guy was on 60 minutes saying it, I mean, he said it was the best time of his life.
[03:12:48.400 --> 03:12:49.400]  He'd do it again.
[03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:51.400]  He worked for Hitler.
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:55.400]  But Soros is so pissed, they even put it in the lawsuits as messages to me.
[03:12:55.400 --> 03:13:02.400]  Jones also claims, it's in the Georgetown lawsuit, that Soros is a Nazi collaborator.
[03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:08.400]  So they're even letting me know we're suing you because we're, and the left worships this Nazi collaborator.
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:09.400]  Why?
[03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:17.400]  Well, actually, in that same interview, remember Alex, he said, look, if I didn't do it, meaning pointing out Jews to be grabbed by the Nazis,
[03:13:17.400 --> 03:13:19.400]  if I didn't do it, somebody else would.
[03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:24.400]  Look, he can be defeated with his own words.
[03:13:24.400 --> 03:13:25.400]  Well, exactly.
[03:13:25.400 --> 03:13:28.400]  But the sociopath doesn't even know how crazy that sounds.
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:35.400]  Well, and the fact that it pops up in multiple lawsuits shows you the coordinated attempt to take down info wars.
[03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:37.400]  That's what this is really about.
[03:13:37.400 --> 03:13:42.400]  Alex Jones could not have made it clearer that he believes people died at Sandy Hook.
[03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:44.400]  It is a smear.
[03:13:44.400 --> 03:13:49.400]  It's a falsehood to say otherwise, whether you're saying it in a lawsuit or saying it in an interview,
[03:13:49.400 --> 03:13:56.400]  but it's a club that they think they can use to bludgeon you and to bludgeon info wars into silence.
[03:13:56.400 --> 03:13:57.400]  Not going to happen.
[03:13:57.400 --> 03:14:03.400]  But I know firsthand the incredible cost of defending in these lawsuits.
[03:14:03.400 --> 03:14:08.400]  You're looking at hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe millions, before this is over.
[03:14:08.400 --> 03:14:11.400]  And people say, oh my God, you're so uprooting mobile, you could pay for it.
[03:14:11.400 --> 03:14:15.400]  No, I didn't get the former wide body jet for $50 million.
[03:14:15.400 --> 03:14:16.400]  Glenn Beck's having to sell.
[03:14:16.400 --> 03:14:19.400]  I mean, I live in a nice house, but it's modest.
[03:14:19.400 --> 03:14:22.400]  I drive, you know, American cars are $50,000.
[03:14:22.400 --> 03:14:23.400]  I got a truck that's 60 hits.
[03:14:23.400 --> 03:14:24.400]  I like it.
[03:14:24.400 --> 03:14:25.400]  It's a big truck.
[03:14:25.400 --> 03:14:27.400]  I mean, and that's, that's, that's it.
[03:14:27.400 --> 03:14:30.400]  I mean, I'm not, I got, I started, I got one nice watch.
[03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:32.400]  I had like 15 people give me nice watches.
[03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:34.400]  So as gifts, I've got a lot of nice watches.
[03:14:34.400 --> 03:14:39.400]  But other than that, I mean, I'm not into things and that's the reality.
[03:14:39.400 --> 03:14:41.400]  And so they really can't take anything away from me.
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:45.400]  So I'm just, it's a good thing though that we've put money back and done things for just this.
[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:47.400]  So now we can fight this for a long time.
[03:14:47.400 --> 03:14:51.400]  But I'm worried, Roger, when they don't shut us down, I think they're going to send a hit team.
[03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:52.400]  And you know, that's okay.
[03:14:52.400 --> 03:14:54.400]  It's just the people you know how real this is.
[03:14:54.400 --> 03:14:59.400]  Because I think they're assassinating my character ahead of killing me like they've tried to kill you.
[03:14:59.400 --> 03:15:05.400]  Well, the good news is you are well guarded and my guess is you're probably packing yourself.
[03:15:05.400 --> 03:15:09.400]  So they'd be making a big mistake to call you out.
[03:15:09.400 --> 03:15:11.400]  No, there's no question.
[03:15:11.400 --> 03:15:13.400]  Infowars drives them completely crazy.
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:14.400]  Why?
[03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:16.400]  Because we're the tip of this beer.
[03:15:16.400 --> 03:15:21.400]  Because we are the cutting edge and we go right to expose them utilizing the facts.
[03:15:21.400 --> 03:15:23.400]  And they hate that more than anything else.
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:27.400]  Folks need to go to the Infowars store now and find that donate button.
[03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:31.400]  Because I can tell you, these lawsuits are ridiculously expensive,
[03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:34.400]  but they must be fought and they must be won.
[03:15:34.400 --> 03:15:36.400]  This is all in attack on you, folks.
[03:15:36.400 --> 03:15:41.400]  Roger's had Obama set a law firm up just to sue Roger and the president.
[03:15:41.400 --> 03:15:42.400]  They're in the same lawsuit.
[03:15:42.400 --> 03:15:43.400]  I mean, this is it.
[03:15:43.400 --> 03:15:44.400]  And then they think you're going to roll over.
[03:15:44.400 --> 03:15:45.400]  They think you don't get out.
[03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:47.400]  Un-American says, we're going to win.
[03:15:47.400 --> 03:15:49.400]  I want to get more into this letter when we come back
[03:15:49.400 --> 03:16:15.400]  and ask what the next shoe to drop is with Roger Stone.
[03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:22.400]  That's libertyoncall.org.
[03:16:49.400 --> 03:16:52.400]  FullyCookedBacon.com
[03:17:20.400 --> 03:17:22.400]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[03:17:22.400 --> 03:17:24.400]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:17:24.400 --> 03:17:26.400]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:17:26.400 --> 03:17:29.400]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[03:17:29.400 --> 03:17:32.400]  should be using this product as a preventative
[03:17:32.400 --> 03:17:34.400]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:17:54.400 --> 03:17:55.400]  I'm so excited.
[03:17:55.400 --> 03:17:57.400]  The new product at m4warslife.com.
[03:17:57.400 --> 03:18:01.400]  In a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim,
[03:18:01.400 --> 03:18:05.400]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:18:05.400 --> 03:18:08.400]  This is a heart and brain pill.
[03:18:08.400 --> 03:18:10.400]  A new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:13.400]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:18:13.400 --> 03:18:18.400]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[03:18:18.400 --> 03:18:21.400]  prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription.
[03:18:21.400 --> 03:18:26.400]  But they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:28.400]  And I came up with our own formulae,
[03:18:28.400 --> 03:18:30.400]  working with some scientists and developers.
[03:18:30.400 --> 03:18:34.400]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:37.400]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[03:18:37.400 --> 03:18:40.400]  which is the precursor to all the hormones
[03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:44.400]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:46.400]  It is amazing.
[03:18:46.400 --> 03:18:50.400]  Red pill, now available at m4warsstore.com.
[03:18:50.400 --> 03:19:19.400]  And your purchase fugs the operation.

[03:19:53.400 --> 03:20:22.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:24.400 --> 03:20:29.400]  Man, I just call this all one of the coolest rifles
[03:20:29.400 --> 03:20:31.400]  during the break.
[03:20:31.400 --> 03:20:33.400]  Really sexy, like Marilyn Monroe or something,
[03:20:33.400 --> 03:20:35.400]  300 blackout.
[03:20:35.400 --> 03:20:38.400]  Really suppressed.
[03:20:38.400 --> 03:20:39.400]  We're going back to Roger Stone,
[03:20:39.400 --> 03:20:42.400]  Roger taking over at the bottom of the hour.
[03:20:42.400 --> 03:20:45.400]  This is such an exciting historical time,
[03:20:45.400 --> 03:20:47.400]  and I see a lot of Americans are somewhat awake.
[03:20:47.400 --> 03:20:49.400]  Our audience is white-hot awake.
[03:20:49.400 --> 03:20:52.400]  That's why the globalists hate it.
[03:20:52.400 --> 03:20:58.400]  But the left is just in a wound-up craved maniac mode.
[03:20:58.400 --> 03:21:00.400]  Comey doesn't see how dumb he looks.
[03:21:00.400 --> 03:21:02.400]  Mueller doesn't know how dumb he looks.
[03:21:02.400 --> 03:21:05.400]  Hillary won't go away.
[03:21:05.400 --> 03:21:07.400]  It's just an incredible time.
[03:21:07.400 --> 03:21:13.400]  You've got a lot to cover here, but...
[03:21:13.400 --> 03:21:15.400]  When does the left hit rock bottom?
[03:21:15.400 --> 03:21:17.400]  When do they stop getting so violent and aggressive?
[03:21:17.400 --> 03:21:19.400]  Or is there no bottom to these people?
[03:21:19.400 --> 03:21:21.400]  Or is there no top to these people?
[03:21:21.400 --> 03:21:23.400]  Well, they'll just never give up.
[03:21:23.400 --> 03:21:26.400]  They refuse to concede the last election.
[03:21:26.400 --> 03:21:28.400]  It is such a shock to their system
[03:21:28.400 --> 03:21:31.400]  that the country elected a reformer and outsider
[03:21:31.400 --> 03:21:36.400]  who doesn't kowtow entirely to their globalist agenda
[03:21:36.400 --> 03:21:38.400]  that they seek to remove him.
[03:21:38.400 --> 03:21:41.400]  I think what we have here is two things going on at once.
[03:21:41.400 --> 03:21:45.400]  First of all, reaction to the fact that they've spent millions
[03:21:45.400 --> 03:21:48.400]  on the whole notion of Russian collusion
[03:21:48.400 --> 03:21:50.400]  and come up completely empty-handed.
[03:21:50.400 --> 03:21:53.400]  Can't remove Donald Trump for that.
[03:21:53.400 --> 03:21:56.400]  Then, when he tweeted a few short days ago
[03:21:56.400 --> 03:21:59.400]  that it was time to get all of our troops out of Syria,
[03:21:59.400 --> 03:22:05.400]  it merely underlined for them their need to remove this president
[03:22:05.400 --> 03:22:07.400]  who isn't committed to...
[03:22:07.400 --> 03:22:09.400]  And that's my next two questions.
[03:22:09.400 --> 03:22:10.400]  He comes out and says,
[03:22:10.400 --> 03:22:11.400]  we're going to get out, mission accomplished,
[03:22:11.400 --> 03:22:13.400]  and then this stage false flag happened.
[03:22:13.400 --> 03:22:14.400]  Totally obvious.
[03:22:14.400 --> 03:22:16.400]  The rebels have been caught before.
[03:22:16.400 --> 03:22:18.400]  They have the motive. Assad doesn't have the motive.
[03:22:18.400 --> 03:22:21.400]  On and on and on, now Haley is bucking him Civil War A.
[03:22:21.400 --> 03:22:23.400]  It shows he's going in sessions
[03:22:23.400 --> 03:22:25.400]  because Trump was always for decriminalization of marijuana.
[03:22:25.400 --> 03:22:27.400]  That'll totally get his approval rating way up,
[03:22:27.400 --> 03:22:28.400]  which it's already done.
[03:22:28.400 --> 03:22:30.400]  It'll totally get mainline people that are reasonable
[03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:32.400]  to go, wow, Obama wouldn't do that.
[03:22:32.400 --> 03:22:33.400]  You're going to do that.
[03:22:33.400 --> 03:22:36.400]  That shows he's raining in sessions that believes in reefer madness
[03:22:36.400 --> 03:22:39.400]  and wants you to put in jail for 10 years for a marijuana cigarette.
[03:22:39.400 --> 03:22:41.400]  Trump announced that last week no coverage
[03:22:41.400 --> 03:22:44.400]  that he said we're going to end the war on marijuana.
[03:22:44.400 --> 03:22:47.400]  I mean, that's something you personally have hammered him on
[03:22:47.400 --> 03:22:50.400]  to keep his promise, but that got no coverage.
[03:22:50.400 --> 03:22:51.400]  It's amazing, isn't it?
[03:22:51.400 --> 03:22:54.400]  Look, I announced six months ago that I was undertaking an effort
[03:22:54.400 --> 03:22:58.400]  organizing something called the United States Cannabis Coalition,
[03:22:58.400 --> 03:23:03.400]  a coalition of both Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives
[03:23:03.400 --> 03:23:09.400]  to lobby the president not to crack down on state legalized medicinal marijuana
[03:23:09.400 --> 03:23:11.400]  and the 29 states that have approved it.
[03:23:11.400 --> 03:23:15.400]  The president has now done exactly what we've been asking him to do.
[03:23:15.400 --> 03:23:17.400]  He should be lauded for this.
[03:23:17.400 --> 03:23:20.400]  Instead, it receives scant coverage.
[03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:24.400]  The one guy I think it is driving crazy is Crazy Jeff Sessions.
[03:23:24.400 --> 03:23:26.400]  But you're absolutely right.
[03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:32.400]  Only you, Alex and Tucker Carlson, the only two major national figures
[03:23:32.400 --> 03:23:37.400]  to speak out against this insanity in Syria,
[03:23:37.400 --> 03:23:42.400]  in which I think the deep staters, the neocons, the war hawks,
[03:23:42.400 --> 03:23:47.400]  once again used the exact same dirty trick that they used months ago,
[03:23:47.400 --> 03:23:50.400]  the phony gas attack, which marked my words,
[03:23:50.400 --> 03:23:54.400]  we will learn shortly they can't prove yet again.
[03:23:54.400 --> 03:23:56.400]  Exactly, but Trump knows this.
[03:23:56.400 --> 03:23:57.400]  He's tweeted this.
[03:23:57.400 --> 03:23:58.400]  The rebels have been caught three times.
[03:23:58.400 --> 03:23:59.400]  Rand Paul's saying it.
[03:23:59.400 --> 03:24:01.400]  The military sources are saying it.
[03:24:01.400 --> 03:24:03.400]  And then now Trump, by striking, has said,
[03:24:03.400 --> 03:24:05.400]  if you do it again, I'll really take you out.
[03:24:05.400 --> 03:24:08.400]  Well, now the rebels are going to do it for sure.
[03:24:08.400 --> 03:24:16.400]  Well, and we can't also pretend that this whole thing has no domestic political impact.
[03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:22.400]  Very, very hard for those on the left to say Donald Trump is in bed with Putin
[03:24:22.400 --> 03:24:27.400]  if he's kicking the crap out of the Syrians who are aligned with Russia.
[03:24:27.400 --> 03:24:32.400]  So I have to admit that the political implications of it...
[03:24:32.400 --> 03:24:34.400]  But it's still a cheap trick.
[03:24:34.400 --> 03:24:36.400]  It's a ridiculously cheap trick.
[03:24:36.400 --> 03:24:42.400]  More importantly, I want to see if our military actions have any real impact
[03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:45.400]  on what's going on in Syria or not.
[03:24:45.400 --> 03:24:50.400]  That surgical strike on the air base only months ago had no impact at all.
[03:24:50.400 --> 03:24:52.400]  The very next day the air base was open for business.
[03:24:52.400 --> 03:24:54.400]  Well, I know behind the scenes the Russians were told.
[03:24:54.400 --> 03:24:55.400]  They said, sure, save face.
[03:24:55.400 --> 03:24:57.400]  And it's about North Korea, too.
[03:24:57.400 --> 03:25:02.400]  But the fact that the neocons are openly in Haley, who can hardly form sentences,
[03:25:02.400 --> 03:25:06.400]  she's just a buffoonic, she sits rumbling, and you'll thank God Matt has reportedly
[03:25:06.400 --> 03:25:08.400]  tried to put the brakes on this.
[03:25:08.400 --> 03:25:15.400]  I mean, it's just insane that now we have these bumbling buffoons trying to start World War III.
[03:25:15.400 --> 03:25:20.400]  Well, and look, the real reason, the only reason Nikki Haley is at the UN
[03:25:20.400 --> 03:25:23.400]  was because Donald Trump wanted to get her out of South Carolina,
[03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:29.400]  where she did not support his candidacy, to elevate the lieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, a good man,
[03:25:29.400 --> 03:25:33.400]  But I was about to say, she was a leading never-Trumper showing your political awareness.
[03:25:33.400 --> 03:25:35.400]  Here's the information right here.
[03:25:35.400 --> 03:25:37.400]  Get the damn never-Trumpers out.
[03:25:37.400 --> 03:25:39.400]  Something you would say day one.
[03:25:39.400 --> 03:25:41.400]  Well, and you can hear Trump actually saying,
[03:25:41.400 --> 03:25:43.400]  well, we got to find some job for Nikki Haley.
[03:25:43.400 --> 03:25:45.400]  Let's send her someplace that doesn't matter.
[03:25:45.400 --> 03:25:47.400]  I've got a great idea.
[03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:48.400]  How about the UN?
[03:25:48.400 --> 03:25:51.400]  Nothing ever happens there that matters.
[03:25:51.400 --> 03:25:54.400]  Well, I mean, how is she going to put up with her in her power trip?
[03:25:54.400 --> 03:25:58.400]  I mean, just the way she stomps around, and I'm so sick of these people.
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:26:03.400]  Alex, she thinks she's running for president. Make no mistake about it.
[03:26:03.400 --> 03:26:07.400]  She should have been defeated when she ran for governor in South Carolina.
[03:26:07.400 --> 03:26:10.400]  There's more than enough on her to blow her away.
[03:26:10.400 --> 03:26:14.400]  Had I been running that campaign, you would never have heard of her again.
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:16.400]  So please step up, Nikki.
[03:26:16.400 --> 03:26:18.400]  Step up. We'd love to talk about it.
[03:26:18.400 --> 03:26:21.400]  And she's always got this guy walking around with her with this status.
[03:26:21.400 --> 03:26:25.400]  What is this weird grin that liberals and conservatives, their establishment have?
[03:26:25.400 --> 03:26:29.400]  They just walk around like they're powerful and confident. It's so fake.
[03:26:29.400 --> 03:26:32.400]  God, it's just so fake when they do it.
[03:26:32.400 --> 03:26:35.400]  Yeah, that is bizarre. Who is that guy?
[03:26:35.400 --> 03:26:37.400]  That would be interesting to know.
[03:26:37.400 --> 03:26:39.400]  Here, I'll make his face.
[03:26:41.400 --> 03:26:44.400]  That, folks, is the face of elitism.
[03:26:44.400 --> 03:26:46.400]  There it is right there.
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:49.400]  You imagine, like, in a delusional power trip, you just strut around,
[03:26:49.400 --> 03:26:53.400]  like, look at people like this, like, I'm powerful.
[03:26:53.400 --> 03:26:57.400]  You see how powerful I am, right?
[03:26:57.400 --> 03:27:02.400]  You know, one thing I can say for sure, when you and I invaded the swamp in Washington last week,
[03:27:02.400 --> 03:27:04.400]  we never looked like that.
[03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:07.400]  We had a good time, but we never looked like that.
[03:27:07.400 --> 03:27:12.400]  Well, no, imagine trying to walk around like you're powerful. It's ridiculous.
[03:27:12.400 --> 03:27:16.400]  Yeah, but it's also part of the game in Washington.
[03:27:16.400 --> 03:27:19.400]  It's all about, you know, you don't place your own phone calls.
[03:27:19.400 --> 03:27:21.400]  You have someone else place your phone call.
[03:27:21.400 --> 03:27:26.400]  Please hold for one moment for Alex Jones. No, it's not done that way.
[03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:30.400]  It's very pretentious. Tell us what's coming up in the next segment.
[03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:36.400]  Well, I want to focus more on what Matt Gaetz and the Band of Eleven are up to,
[03:27:36.400 --> 03:27:40.400]  because I think this is the new crucial move.
[03:27:40.400 --> 03:27:43.400]  You've been saying this for some weeks. You're absolutely right.
[03:27:43.400 --> 03:27:49.400]  It's essential for the forces of freedom to get on the offense and get off defense.
[03:27:49.400 --> 03:27:54.400]  Enough talking about Russia, enough talking about the mountain of disinformation
[03:27:54.400 --> 03:27:59.400]  regarding WikiLeaks and Julian Assange and Michael Cohn and Stormy.
[03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:02.400]  All of that is a distraction.
[03:28:02.400 --> 03:28:08.400]  Bill and Hillary, Barack Obama, caught red-handed, breaking the law,
[03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:11.400]  serious jail time felonies.
[03:28:11.400 --> 03:28:15.400]  When are we going to get an attorney general in a justice department,
[03:28:15.400 --> 03:28:22.400]  committed to the rule of law and committed to prosecuting the egregious crimes of these criminals?
[03:28:22.400 --> 03:28:25.400]  We'll be taking calls in the next segment as well,
[03:28:25.400 --> 03:28:28.400]  because I find a lot of info warriors want to talk about.
[03:28:28.400 --> 03:28:31.400]  That's right. 877-789-2539.
[03:28:31.400 --> 03:28:34.400]  To talk to Roger Stone, 877-789-2539.
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:36.400]  I'm going to punch you out here and take care of business.
[03:28:36.400 --> 03:28:38.400]  Shoot some live reports and gear up for some other operations.
[03:28:38.400 --> 03:28:41.400]  Big breaking news, of course, war room coming up.
[03:28:41.400 --> 03:28:46.400]  The judge will be part of as well, co-hosting at 3 o'clock central in 32 minutes from now.
[03:28:46.400 --> 03:29:12.400]  We'll be right back.

[03:29:19.400 --> 03:29:48.400]  61877-99B-E-R-K-E-Y.

[03:30:32.400 --> 03:30:34.400]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[03:31:18.400 --> 03:31:20.400]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[03:31:20.400 --> 03:31:25.400]  I really like the vitamin-interfusion, to be honest. That's really incredible.
[03:31:25.400 --> 03:31:28.400]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:31:28.400 --> 03:31:32.400]  I haven't felt sweet. My morning was fantastic, and I love the guys.

[03:33:19.400 --> 03:33:22.400]  It's Roger Stone.

[03:33:29.400 --> 03:33:32.400]  Alright, welcome back. I'm Roger Stone.
[03:33:32.400 --> 03:33:39.400]  Now in the chair in the Alex Jones show, don't forget to join us at the war room
[03:33:39.400 --> 03:33:42.400]  immediately after the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:42.400 --> 03:33:47.400]  Well, there seems to be some coverage in the media today of the fact that I was
[03:33:47.400 --> 03:33:53.400]  overheard in a New York restaurant saying that Barbara Bush drank so much booze
[03:33:53.400 --> 03:33:59.400]  that if they had cremated her, her body would have burned for three days.
[03:33:59.400 --> 03:34:04.400]  Trust me, Barbara Bush made Betty Ford look like Carrie Nation.
[03:34:04.400 --> 03:34:10.400]  She was a very mean, vindictive, and entitled person.
[03:34:10.400 --> 03:34:15.400]  And I assure you, after Ronald Reagan defeated her husband,
[03:34:15.400 --> 03:34:20.400]  George Bush in the New York and New Jersey primaries in 1980
[03:34:20.400 --> 03:34:25.400]  and drew to a standstill in Connecticut,
[03:34:25.400 --> 03:34:28.400]  well, she said much worse things about me.
[03:34:28.400 --> 03:34:31.400]  Let me stop you. I was going to go, but I was here eating my lunch.
[03:34:31.400 --> 03:34:33.400]  I wanted to watch you and enjoy myself.
[03:34:33.400 --> 03:34:35.400]  But I just remember reading the history books about it.
[03:34:35.400 --> 03:34:37.400]  Nancy Reagan hated her.
[03:34:37.400 --> 03:34:40.400]  Absolutely said she was a demon. And so the media is all lionizing.
[03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:43.400]  I don't want to speak ill of the dead, but I just didn't cover it.
[03:34:43.400 --> 03:34:46.400]  But then she famously went on Larry King Live and said,
[03:34:46.400 --> 03:34:49.400]  if you talk bad about my family, I will kill you.
[03:34:49.400 --> 03:34:51.400]  And Larry King said, what does that mean?
[03:34:51.400 --> 03:34:53.400]  She goes, I will kill you.
[03:34:53.400 --> 03:34:56.400]  So was she really the first female president?
[03:34:56.400 --> 03:34:59.400]  Well, and not only that, but you may remember, Alex,
[03:34:59.400 --> 03:35:05.400]  that she was well enough to travel to New Hampshire to campaign for Jeb,
[03:35:05.400 --> 03:35:08.400]  for president, but only days later,
[03:35:08.400 --> 03:35:12.400]  she was too sick to attend the funeral of Nancy Reagan.
[03:35:12.400 --> 03:35:19.400]  Nancy Reagan married to the man who revived George H.W. Bush's career.
[03:35:19.400 --> 03:35:22.400]  Let's be clear. H.W. ran against Reagan.
[03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:25.400]  Reagan said he was a globalist, new world order, trilateralist
[03:35:25.400 --> 03:35:27.400]  at the famous convention, as you know.
[03:35:27.400 --> 03:35:30.400]  They made him take him or said, we'll basically take you out.
[03:35:30.400 --> 03:35:33.400]  Then the Bush senior was hanging around,
[03:35:33.400 --> 03:35:38.400]  obviously with Hinkley and the brother was that then shot Reagan.
[03:35:38.400 --> 03:35:39.400]  Absolutely.
[03:35:39.400 --> 03:35:42.400]  Tell folks what Nancy Reagan thought about what happened to her husband.
[03:35:42.400 --> 03:35:46.400]  Nancy Reagan believed that the Bushes were involved in the attempt
[03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:48.400]  on her husband's life.
[03:35:48.400 --> 03:35:51.400]  Anyone who'd like to read more about this, get my book,
[03:35:51.400 --> 03:35:53.400]  The Bush Crime Family.
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:35:57.400]  There's an entire chapter on the attempted assassination
[03:35:57.400 --> 03:36:00.400]  of one of our greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan,
[03:36:00.400 --> 03:36:03.400]  and the Bush family's various ties,
[03:36:03.400 --> 03:36:06.400]  not just through one of the Bush sons to Hinkley,
[03:36:06.400 --> 03:36:10.400]  but various other ties to that assassination.
[03:36:10.400 --> 03:36:13.400]  As soon as Reagan is shot, it is assumed that he's been hit
[03:36:13.400 --> 03:36:15.400]  and he's going to die.
[03:36:15.400 --> 03:36:18.400]  The Bush people try to grab the nuclear football immediately,
[03:36:18.400 --> 03:36:22.400]  and oddly enough, they are repelled by Al Haig.
[03:36:22.400 --> 03:36:25.400]  Al Haig had no great love for the Bushes.
[03:36:25.400 --> 03:36:27.400]  And the media spun it that Haig was trying to be a dictator.
[03:36:27.400 --> 03:36:30.400]  Now, he came out and the press coverage said, I'm in charge, I'm in charge,
[03:36:30.400 --> 03:36:32.400]  not the Bushes, the president's okay.
[03:36:32.400 --> 03:36:34.400]  Exactly.
[03:36:34.400 --> 03:36:37.400]  That whole thing has been badly bastardized,
[03:36:37.400 --> 03:36:40.400]  and if you look at Haig's comments within context,
[03:36:40.400 --> 03:36:42.400]  he didn't say anything wrong,
[03:36:42.400 --> 03:36:45.400]  but there's an immediate attempt by James Baker III
[03:36:45.400 --> 03:36:48.400]  and the Bush people to destroy Al Haig
[03:36:48.400 --> 03:36:51.400]  because he stands in the way of their grabbing the power.
[03:36:51.400 --> 03:36:56.400]  George H.W. Bush is still alive and he's still a criminal.
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:36:59.400]  I'm going to get my book, The Bush Crime Family, Lays It All Out.
[03:36:59.400 --> 03:37:02.400]  Rest in peace, Barbara Bush, but let there be no mistake,
[03:37:02.400 --> 03:37:05.400]  she was not a great or nice person.
[03:37:05.400 --> 03:37:08.400]  Well, let's be clear, I held my tongue, but since you're doing it, I'll do it.
[03:37:08.400 --> 03:37:13.400]  They were the main family, Prescott Bush, that was the main Nazi lawyer,
[03:37:13.400 --> 03:37:17.400]  and then all that money that went to Texas and went to Central and South America
[03:37:17.400 --> 03:37:20.400]  and their big command bases, and a bunch of the Nazis came over,
[03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:23.400]  and that's why the Bushes got so powerful.
[03:37:23.400 --> 03:37:27.400]  That's why as the money man for his dad, they put him as the head of the CIA.
[03:37:27.400 --> 03:37:30.400]  We never worked for the CIA except back when he helped kill Kennedy.
[03:37:30.400 --> 03:37:33.400]  That all came out in federal documents, as you know, so he lied about that.
[03:37:33.400 --> 03:37:36.400]  And the thing is, women and children are not in the fight.
[03:37:36.400 --> 03:37:40.400]  I don't put mine in it, but she, as they brag, oh, she's just a first lady.
[03:37:40.400 --> 03:37:44.400]  No, from my research, Barbara and her whole family of folks
[03:37:44.400 --> 03:37:49.400]  are really some mean people and the toughest nails as well.
[03:37:49.400 --> 03:37:51.400]  Well, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[03:37:51.400 --> 03:37:56.400]  Prescott Bush was, of course, the main financier of the Nazi war machine.
[03:37:56.400 --> 03:38:02.400]  This is how Hitler paid for his munitions and financed his war.
[03:38:02.400 --> 03:38:04.400]  They almost got arrested by the McCormick-Dickstein committee.
[03:38:04.400 --> 03:38:08.400]  I mean, all this was in the news back then, but it got swept out of the rug.
[03:38:08.400 --> 03:38:11.400]  Well, and as you know, they seized his bank.
[03:38:11.400 --> 03:38:18.400]  Had he not been well-connected in a bones man, he probably would have been tried for treason.
[03:38:18.400 --> 03:38:25.400]  The entire story of the Bushes is whether it is Prescott Bush's financing of the Nazis,
[03:38:25.400 --> 03:38:31.400]  George H.W. Bush's trafficking of cocaine to pay for the illegal war, Nicaragua,
[03:38:31.400 --> 03:38:35.400]  or Jeb Bush is acting as a drug dealer in Miami.
[03:38:35.400 --> 03:38:37.400]  It's all in my book.
[03:38:37.400 --> 03:38:41.400]  This is a criminal cabal, the Bush family,
[03:38:41.400 --> 03:38:45.400]  and watching the media lionize Barbara Bush today,
[03:38:45.400 --> 03:38:50.400]  who was a mean-spirited, nasty drunk, is a bit more than I can stand.
[03:38:50.400 --> 03:38:55.400]  Well, my God, I mean, she looked in 1990, I was watching speeches like she was 90 years old.
[03:38:55.400 --> 03:38:58.400]  And I got to give it to her, she's tough, though.
[03:38:58.400 --> 03:39:02.400]  I'm told she drank more than Winston Churchill, who they thought was the greatest drunk ever.
[03:39:02.400 --> 03:39:04.400]  What does she mainly imbibe him?
[03:39:04.400 --> 03:39:11.400]  She was hitting the screwdrivers around 9 o'clock every morning as she was loaded by lunch.
[03:39:11.400 --> 03:39:17.400]  What's ironic, and I reveal this in the book, George H.W. Bush had a long-time mistress
[03:39:17.400 --> 03:39:20.400]  by the name of Jennifer Fitzgerald.
[03:39:20.400 --> 03:39:23.400]  And Alex, she was no better looking than Barbara Bush.
[03:39:23.400 --> 03:39:25.400]  What's with that?
[03:39:25.400 --> 03:39:27.400]  What does that mean psychologically?
[03:39:27.400 --> 03:39:29.400]  Because we're not being mean here.
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:34.400]  You know, it was Charlotte Isbury, great patriot, whose dad was the skull and bones that leaked it to her
[03:39:34.400 --> 03:39:39.400]  before he died of cancer, and she gave it to Anthony Sutton, the congressional investigator.
[03:39:39.400 --> 03:39:44.400]  And then all of them aren't bad, but, you know, they get in feces, they worship Lucifer, they pee on each other,
[03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:46.400]  they get in coffins and are reborn.
[03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:53.400]  You know, you watch The Good Shepherd, The Directive by Robert De Niro, starring Matt Damon that goes through some of that.
[03:39:53.400 --> 03:39:54.400]  I mean, that's real.
[03:39:54.400 --> 03:39:59.400]  I mean, why not fraternities have some, you know, a couple drinks and hang out with some nice ladies
[03:39:59.400 --> 03:40:00.400]  or go have a campfire?
[03:40:00.400 --> 03:40:06.400]  It's like, what is it about these elites that they want to swim around in human feces and, you know, getting coffins?
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:08.400]  I'm not going to get into what they do.
[03:40:08.400 --> 03:40:11.400]  It just shows these are not normal people.
[03:40:11.400 --> 03:40:15.400]  No, it's high-wasp, elitist style.
[03:40:15.400 --> 03:40:22.400]  You see the same thing in the upper classes in Europe, a great prevence of pedophilia,
[03:40:22.400 --> 03:40:25.400]  some instance of that in the case of George H. W. Bush.
[03:40:25.400 --> 03:40:28.400]  Again, I refer you to my book.
[03:40:28.400 --> 03:40:30.400]  Well, let's go ahead and risk our lives big time here.
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:37.400]  Go ahead and get into it, because I talked to a police detective 15, 16 years ago who was documented who he was.
[03:40:37.400 --> 03:40:43.400]  And he told me about privately investigating the bushes in Houston.
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:45.400]  And he later, about two years later, died.
[03:40:45.400 --> 03:40:47.400]  And he hit and run T-bone accident.
[03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:48.400]  I'm sure it was no big deal.
[03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:49.400]  But I didn't go with it.
[03:40:49.400 --> 03:40:50.400]  It was so fantastical and he couldn't prove it.
[03:40:50.400 --> 03:40:55.400]  He said investigating them, he was following them once after he wasn't president,
[03:40:55.400 --> 03:41:01.400]  and that they went to this big church on the outskirts of Houston, north of it, and they go in there.
[03:41:01.400 --> 03:41:06.400]  And so he came back about a week later and was able to get in when a janitor was in there.
[03:41:06.400 --> 03:41:11.400]  And then it was baby blue flags with huge swastikas on it.
[03:41:11.400 --> 03:41:14.400]  And he said to the weird old guy that was there, he said, what is this?
[03:41:14.400 --> 03:41:17.400]  He said, this is the true church of God.
[03:41:17.400 --> 03:41:21.400]  And then I talked to a guy I knew in college, and I'm not going to get into the whole details.
[03:41:21.400 --> 03:41:25.400]  And he thought George H. W. was a great guy, but I'm not even going to go there.
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:27.400]  But finish your point, I'm sorry.
[03:41:27.400 --> 03:41:28.400]  This is just too insane.
[03:41:28.400 --> 03:41:30.400]  No, Alex, I think you're making a good point.
[03:41:30.400 --> 03:41:38.400]  The thing about George H. W. Bush is he had this kind of goofy, likable, you know, veneer on the outside.
[03:41:38.400 --> 03:41:48.400]  But that hid a steely determination to become president and take care of anybody who needed to, who got in his way.
[03:41:48.400 --> 03:41:54.400]  And then he stood down and let Bill Clinton in to be his second and third term.
[03:41:54.400 --> 03:42:00.400]  Well, he got orders from the same globalists who elected him saying, hey, George, you didn't do too well.
[03:42:00.400 --> 03:42:03.400]  We're going to have to replace you with a younger guy.
[03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:04.400]  Your time is up.
[03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:08.400]  That's why he looks at his watch famously in the debate.
[03:42:08.400 --> 03:42:12.400]  Because the globalists have told him he's being moved off the stage.
[03:42:12.400 --> 03:42:14.400]  He was never very talented.
[03:42:14.400 --> 03:42:15.400]  He believed in nothing.
[03:42:15.400 --> 03:42:17.400]  He had no ideology at all.
[03:42:17.400 --> 03:42:19.400]  By the way, they keep saying Trump believes in nothing.
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:26.400]  When we come back, Trump believes in America and free market competition and fighting back against the establishment rich that were given their money
[03:42:26.400 --> 03:42:28.400]  versus somebody like him who actually made his money.
[03:42:28.400 --> 03:42:31.400]  That's what I believe the Trump ethos is.
[03:42:31.400 --> 03:42:36.400]  And that he's smart enough to beat and outsmart all these blue bloods and stuff shirts that he's grown up around.
[03:42:36.400 --> 03:42:42.400]  We'll see if I'm right with Roger Stone on the other side, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[03:42:42.400 --> 03:42:43.400]  I just can't get off the air.
[03:42:43.400 --> 03:42:53.400]  I just can't shut up.
[03:42:53.400 --> 03:42:55.400]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.

[03:45:16.400 --> 03:45:20.400]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[03:45:20.400 --> 03:45:23.400]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female.
[03:45:23.400 --> 03:45:28.400]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:45:28.400 --> 03:45:31.400]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:45:31.400 --> 03:45:35.400]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:45:35.400 --> 03:45:37.400]  So obviously the super female is amazing.
[03:45:37.400 --> 03:45:38.400]  I love it.
[03:45:38.400 --> 03:45:40.400]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[03:45:40.400 --> 03:45:42.400]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:42.400 --> 03:45:48.400]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine, Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:48.400 --> 03:45:50.400]  It's got a five star rating.
[03:45:50.400 --> 03:46:19.400]  So win, win, infowarslife.com.
[03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:36.400]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:46:36.400 --> 03:46:47.400]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.
[03:46:47.400 --> 03:46:56.400]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[03:46:56.400 --> 03:47:07.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:07.400 --> 03:47:14.400]  There are a lot of reasons people don't like Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[03:47:14.400 --> 03:47:18.400]  But I was just thinking about the chief amongst them all.
[03:47:18.400 --> 03:47:24.400]  From the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.400 --> 03:47:29.400]  And now your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:29.400 --> 03:47:31.400]  I know why they hate us.
[03:47:31.400 --> 03:47:33.400]  Because the globalists get unconscious.
[03:47:33.400 --> 03:47:37.400]  A lot of them are psychopaths, sociopaths or mercenaries.
[03:47:37.400 --> 03:47:42.400]  And they don't like hearing about the big picture or about history or about how they're failing.
[03:47:42.400 --> 03:47:44.400]  They like to be the only narrative.
[03:47:44.400 --> 03:47:47.400]  I've learned evil people are very OCD.
[03:47:47.400 --> 03:47:49.400]  Good people can be OCD as well.
[03:47:49.400 --> 03:47:53.400]  But they're very rote.
[03:47:53.400 --> 03:47:56.400]  They have a cant about what they do.
[03:47:56.400 --> 03:48:00.400]  And they don't like the disturbance of freedom.
[03:48:00.400 --> 03:48:04.400]  They don't like the volatile nature of the free market.
[03:48:04.400 --> 03:48:12.400]  And I was just thinking, we talk about Prescott Bush and the Nazis and all of it.
[03:48:12.400 --> 03:48:16.400]  That's so fantastical and it's all real.
[03:48:16.400 --> 03:48:20.400]  And the crew, a lot of times we hire folks that are kind of agnostic politically.
[03:48:20.400 --> 03:48:22.400]  And I go, I'm not worried about them.
[03:48:22.400 --> 03:48:25.400]  They're going to sit there and search engine when I say all day and see that I'm not lying.
[03:48:25.400 --> 03:48:28.400]  In fact, it's worse than I say.
[03:48:28.400 --> 03:48:31.400]  And see the globalists think I'm a schmuck.
[03:48:31.400 --> 03:48:34.400]  They think as I care about other people that I'm an idiot.
[03:48:34.400 --> 03:48:36.400]  I'm not in the ruling class that's cold-blooded.
[03:48:36.400 --> 03:48:38.400]  Oh, I'm cold-blooded if I need to be.
[03:48:38.400 --> 03:48:44.400]  The difference is, I know what built real civilization was people actually trying to have a better world
[03:48:44.400 --> 03:48:49.400]  and build a better system and build a better mousetrap and to have goals and destinies,
[03:48:49.400 --> 03:48:55.400]  not to dominate other people, but to elevate humanity through competition.
[03:48:55.400 --> 03:49:01.400]  But the whole left system is about ending competition and giving participation troubles everybody.
[03:49:01.400 --> 03:49:05.400]  Again, I've said this a hundred times, it's not some virtue signaling, it's the truth.
[03:49:05.400 --> 03:49:09.400]  I love people of every color and every region, every place.
[03:49:09.400 --> 03:49:14.400]  You can tell who's smart and who's got a good spirit and who gets it and who doesn't.
[03:49:14.400 --> 03:49:18.400]  And I don't give a damn what color you are.
[03:49:18.400 --> 03:49:21.400]  If you've got a good attitude and you are having fun,
[03:49:21.400 --> 03:49:27.400]  whether it is about economics or politics or sexual, I'm married, I'm just saying.
[03:49:27.400 --> 03:49:29.400]  I'm attracted to your energy.
[03:49:29.400 --> 03:49:32.400]  If you didn't even have a woman who physically isn't that good looking,
[03:49:32.400 --> 03:49:35.400]  but if she's got a great attitude and is smart, I find that super sexy.
[03:49:35.400 --> 03:49:38.400]  You can have the most beautiful women out there that look like Barbie dolls
[03:49:38.400 --> 03:49:40.400]  and they're empty narcissistic husks.
[03:49:40.400 --> 03:49:45.400]  If I wasn't married, I couldn't go out and date them, I couldn't have relations with them
[03:49:45.400 --> 03:49:50.400]  because there's no grit, there's no substance, there's no soul.
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:55.400]  And all I know is this global system feels soulless, acts soulless,
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:49:58.400]  and I have no truck with it, nothing to do with it.
[03:49:58.400 --> 03:50:01.400]  How would you quantify this global system and what it's doing?
[03:50:01.400 --> 03:50:04.400]  And then this big letter, we should make a bigger deal out of them.
[03:50:04.400 --> 03:50:09.400]  I'm glad you said that 11 valiant Congress members, who I know are going to go through hell now,
[03:50:09.400 --> 03:50:13.400]  but they joined good company, that's how we get here, is not a bunch of yes men,
[03:50:13.400 --> 03:50:18.400]  saying criminal activity by the Clintons and Comey and all these people
[03:50:18.400 --> 03:50:20.400]  trying to set up the president.
[03:50:20.400 --> 03:50:24.400]  I mean, we have them, we have them, get the rights, don't we get,
[03:50:24.400 --> 03:50:28.400]  they're only going to come after Trump and then like Domino's, all the rest of us that have done nothing.
[03:50:28.400 --> 03:50:31.400]  I mean, I re-tweeted some guy this morning, let's pull it up if you can.
[03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:35.400]  Like 7.30 in the morning, I'm sitting there scrambling eggs for my kids
[03:50:35.400 --> 03:50:39.400]  and I see this tweet and it goes, oh yeah, Jones, you say that it's, you know,
[03:50:39.400 --> 03:50:43.400]  Trump and then Hannity and then you are the most outspoken and then Tucker
[03:50:43.400 --> 03:50:44.400]  and it's like Roger Stone.
[03:50:44.400 --> 03:50:47.400]  That's right, we know it's you and Mueller's going to arrest you soon.
[03:50:47.400 --> 03:50:50.400]  And all these re-tweets, yeah, we're going to put you in prison.
[03:50:50.400 --> 03:50:51.400]  We're going to kill you.
[03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:53.400]  Hey, you're in a man's game now, boys.
[03:50:53.400 --> 03:50:55.400]  You came to a free country, you piss all over.
[03:50:55.400 --> 03:50:58.400]  Whether you're white, black, it doesn't matter, you're these little globalists
[03:50:58.400 --> 03:51:01.400]  and you think the country that's giving you all this is the bad place
[03:51:01.400 --> 03:51:03.400]  because we're trying to keep it going.
[03:51:03.400 --> 03:51:04.400]  You're morons.
[03:51:04.400 --> 03:51:07.400]  Yes, I know they might put me in prison or kill me.
[03:51:07.400 --> 03:51:09.400]  You always remind me like it scares me.
[03:51:09.400 --> 03:51:12.400]  It doesn't scare me except for your damn soul
[03:51:12.400 --> 03:51:15.400]  because you're such pathetic sacks of crap.
[03:51:15.400 --> 03:51:17.400]  You don't have skin in the game like I do.
[03:51:17.400 --> 03:51:21.400]  You just sit there on your ass on Twitter getting promoted by Twitter
[03:51:21.400 --> 03:51:22.400]  because you threaten people all day.
[03:51:22.400 --> 03:51:24.400]  You little piece of crap.
[03:51:24.400 --> 03:51:25.400]  Go ahead, Roger.
[03:51:25.400 --> 03:51:29.400]  Now, the amazing thing, Alex, you're absolutely right about the globalists
[03:51:29.400 --> 03:51:35.400]  and our political elite is they hypnotize themselves into believing their own BS.
[03:51:35.400 --> 03:51:42.400]  They actually think they are August, you know, a special word.
[03:51:42.400 --> 03:51:46.400]  It's the sanctum, like, it's this, oh, we're so powerful.
[03:51:46.400 --> 03:51:48.400]  And then there are sacks of crap.
[03:51:48.400 --> 03:51:54.400]  No, these are venal, small-time criminals, Bill and Hillary, George and Barbara.
[03:51:54.400 --> 03:51:56.400]  They would steal a hot stove.
[03:51:56.400 --> 03:51:57.400]  They have no honor.
[03:51:57.400 --> 03:51:58.400]  They have no principle.
[03:51:58.400 --> 03:52:02.400]  They believe in nothing other than the accumulation of power
[03:52:02.400 --> 03:52:04.400]  and lining their own pockets.
[03:52:04.400 --> 03:52:06.400]  They're not worthy of praise.
[03:52:06.400 --> 03:52:09.400]  And that's why they keep thinking, intimidating us and messing with us.
[03:52:09.400 --> 03:52:12.400]  How would they notice the more they mess with us, the more aggressive we get?
[03:52:12.400 --> 03:52:18.400]  Look, I understand I'm going to take a lot of crap for speaking the truth about Barbara Bush.
[03:52:18.400 --> 03:52:21.400]  She was a mean-spirited, vindictive drunk.
[03:52:21.400 --> 03:52:24.400]  She is ascending into hell right now.
[03:52:24.400 --> 03:52:25.400]  She's not going to heaven.
[03:52:25.400 --> 03:52:27.400]  She was a bad person.
[03:52:27.400 --> 03:52:29.400]  Don't lionize her because she was wonderful.
[03:52:29.400 --> 03:52:34.400]  She was married to a Nazi wealth crime syndicate just like Junker.
[03:52:34.400 --> 03:52:41.400]  We have the unelected head of the EU dictatorship, owns Luxembourg, and his grandfather and father were top Nazis.
[03:52:41.400 --> 03:52:43.400]  And then he lacks exactly.
[03:52:43.400 --> 03:52:46.400]  It's like, why do we roll over to the hype of the BS?
[03:52:46.400 --> 03:52:57.400]  Well, and the reason that this show is so controversial, the reason why the left hates Info Wars is we have the courage to say these things.
[03:52:57.400 --> 03:52:59.400]  That's right. The left wants war now. We don't.
[03:52:59.400 --> 03:53:00.400]  They don't like that.
[03:53:00.400 --> 03:53:02.400]  They want to just say, we're liberals. We're good.
[03:53:02.400 --> 03:53:04.400]  We want World War Three, Hal Hitler.
[03:53:04.400 --> 03:53:11.400]  So we reveal certain inconvenient truths and it drives the left crazy.
[03:53:11.400 --> 03:53:26.400]  That's why these phony lawsuits to shut Info Wars down, the lawsuits against me, against the president, they're trying to break us financially and create a rationale for taking us off the internet, for silencing us.
[03:53:26.400 --> 03:53:30.400]  Then there'll be nobody contradicting their BS when they tell us how great they are.
[03:53:30.400 --> 03:53:34.400]  And then they'll start World War Three because the Russians aren't rolling over.
[03:53:34.400 --> 03:53:42.400]  Well, as I travel across the country meeting with the proud boys and patriots all over, they're not rolling over either.
[03:53:42.400 --> 03:53:49.400]  If there is an attempt to illegitimately remove this president, you are going to have a civil war.
[03:53:49.400 --> 03:53:54.400]  We're not advocating for it. We're not fermenting it, but we are recognizing it.
[03:53:54.400 --> 03:53:56.400]  It's not 1974.
[03:53:56.400 --> 03:53:58.400]  Absolutely.
[03:53:58.400 --> 03:54:02.400]  I forgot we have loaded phones. Is there any way to transfer these over when the war room starts? They can take them.
[03:54:02.400 --> 03:54:07.400]  I apologize to all these callers. I forgot we gave the number out. We didn't go to them.
[03:54:07.400 --> 03:54:09.400]  What are we going to do about that?
[03:54:09.400 --> 03:54:14.400]  Can all of them get first dibs? Charles and Josh and Justin and Tim and Roger and Mark?
[03:54:14.400 --> 03:54:17.400]  Can they all get first dibs? Our listeners are so great.
[03:54:17.400 --> 03:54:20.400]  Can we just open the phones up so only they call in right at the starter?
[03:54:20.400 --> 03:54:25.400]  Give them the number now so they can call in on the other side so they can go to calls very early next hour.
[03:54:25.400 --> 03:54:33.400]  We'll do that. What's the number on the other side? I forget it.
[03:54:33.400 --> 03:54:43.400]  So, Triple 8, 201, 2244.
[03:54:43.400 --> 03:54:52.400]  You know, I should be smart and a big boy and write that down. What's up, Daria? It's 888, what?
[03:54:52.400 --> 03:55:01.400]  Your mic's not open. Go ahead. Oh, there it is. 888, 201, 2244.
[03:55:01.400 --> 03:55:05.400]  And those folks, they're already hanging up. They'll get in front of the line when they call in.
[03:55:05.400 --> 03:55:11.400]  Just briefly, if you take action, they cannot stop us short of putting bullets in our heads.
[03:55:11.400 --> 03:55:13.400]  Okay? And nobody's going to buy that.
[03:55:13.400 --> 03:55:17.400]  So, if you simply go get water filters, those are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[03:55:17.400 --> 03:55:24.400]  Air filters, super high-quality, lowest prices. And you simply go get a supermail vitality, amazing cold-pressed herbs.
[03:55:24.400 --> 03:55:30.400]  It takes five, six times the amount of herbs when it's just powder. You don't get it as well, so it's still alive, basically.
[03:55:30.400 --> 03:55:34.400]  50% off, that is a huge deal. You can get it with free shipping.
[03:55:34.400 --> 03:55:38.400]  And 50% off with the real red pill or alpha power that's back in.
[03:55:38.400 --> 03:55:42.400]  And alpha power technically is stronger, but some people get better results with supermail because it's cold-pressed.
[03:55:42.400 --> 03:55:44.400]  It all depends on how your body works.
[03:55:44.400 --> 03:55:47.400]  People go, well, is alpha power better? Is supermail better?
[03:55:47.400 --> 03:55:50.400]  What's the best?
[03:55:50.400 --> 03:55:53.400]  It's all different for different people. They're different formulas.
[03:55:53.400 --> 03:55:56.400]  They have some of the same things, not some of the same things.
[03:55:56.400 --> 03:56:00.400]  It varies person to person, your physiology, your metabolic system.
[03:56:00.400 --> 03:56:03.400]  But we've got combo packs with free shipping on top of 50% off.
[03:56:03.400 --> 03:56:05.400]  And so it takes a lot of sales for us to find the operation.
[03:56:05.400 --> 03:56:07.400]  But these are game-changing products.
[03:56:07.400 --> 03:56:15.400]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or AAA-253-33139.
[03:56:15.400 --> 03:56:18.400]  We have had X2 for almost six years.
[03:56:18.400 --> 03:56:23.400]  It's the only mind-deep-earth, pure iodine crystals out there, the good halogen.
[03:56:23.400 --> 03:56:27.400]  It blows people away. Energy, stamina, you're just everything.
[03:56:27.400 --> 03:56:29.400]  People that have major issues, though, you need to talk to your physician before.
[03:56:29.400 --> 03:56:34.400]  98% reviews at power reviews of thousands, 6,000-plus reviews.
[03:56:34.400 --> 03:56:37.400]  Nobody's got that. We are running out of it.
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:40.400]  But we weren't going to get more until June, the middle of June.
[03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:43.400]  They are accelerating a small, not even a half-ship,
[03:56:43.400 --> 03:56:46.400]  but they correct me, a quarter-shipment of a few thousand bottles.
[03:56:46.400 --> 03:56:49.400]  So I'm going to extend the sale out for four or five more days,
[03:56:49.400 --> 03:56:52.400]  and then it's still going to end up selling out before we get more in June.
[03:56:52.400 --> 03:56:55.400]  And then we have the rest of that run and another run,
[03:56:55.400 --> 03:56:59.400]  and then we have not gotten more, and they've already charged us more,
