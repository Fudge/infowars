[00:16.240 --> 00:21.840]  After that, thanks for listening and supporting our online sponsors at DerryBrownfield.com.
[00:21.840 --> 00:40.240]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:40.240 --> 00:45.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.000]  You want answers?
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:48.000 --> 01:06.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:06.480 --> 01:12.200]  In the last five days, the massive Oklahoma City story has broken.
[01:12.200 --> 01:17.880]  More evidence of government involvement, huge BBC story broke yesterday during this
[01:17.880 --> 01:22.480]  broadcast, thanks to listeners paying attention and finding it.
[01:22.480 --> 01:31.440]  Concerning the British Broadcasting Communist, live on 9-11, up there propagandizing, and
[01:31.440 --> 01:36.680]  20-plus minutes before Building 7 fell, they started reporting that Building 7 had already
[01:36.680 --> 01:40.400]  collapsed, getting off script, going a little early with their script.
[01:40.400 --> 01:44.600]  They then cut to a reporter on the ground a few miles from Building 7.
[01:44.600 --> 01:48.440]  You see it clearly in the background, and then she steps aside and describes how the
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.960]  Solomon Brothers Building, that's the name of Building 7, had fallen.
[01:53.960 --> 01:57.960]  And there it is, smoking nothing had fallen.
[01:57.960 --> 02:03.600]  This is a huge story and they pulled it twice off Google yesterday.
[02:03.600 --> 02:06.120]  They pulled it again last night.
[02:06.120 --> 02:09.600]  This really was an illustration for folks about the real-time censorship as they were
[02:09.600 --> 02:15.640]  scanning the entire millions of videos that are posted on Google to bring it down.
[02:15.640 --> 02:17.640]  It was posted on YouTube and was brought down.
[02:17.640 --> 02:24.400]  It's now back up as they desperately scramble to stop you from being able to see this.
[02:24.400 --> 02:28.560]  We have the audio of it right now, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:28.560 --> 02:33.160]  If you've seen the video, if you've heard us talk about it, if you want to discuss it,
[02:33.160 --> 02:36.160]  and if you have any questions or comments or statements you'd like to make, we'll be
[02:36.160 --> 02:41.920]  talking about Oklahoma City, 9-11 and Building 7, the new revelations in this first hour,
[02:41.920 --> 02:44.040]  the toll-free number to join us.
[02:44.040 --> 02:56.240]  And again, we're live the 27th day, it is the 27th day of February 2007.
[02:56.240 --> 03:00.600]  By the way, coming up on March 2nd on Friday, there's going to be the huge Texas Independence
[03:00.600 --> 03:02.880]  Day Rally that I really should have been promoting more in the past.
[03:02.880 --> 03:06.120]  We mentioned it some, we've got a big banner with a list of some of the speakers and the
[03:06.120 --> 03:08.760]  tales up on InfoWars.com.
[03:08.760 --> 03:10.200]  Please go get that report.
[03:10.200 --> 03:15.320]  It's a story we've put together and get it out to everyone.
[03:15.320 --> 03:20.640]  Looks like a Dallas Cowboys logo, great banner, Ryan Slickhaisen put together, up on InfoWars.com.
[03:20.640 --> 03:26.440]  Go get it, go through the link, get the story, email it to everybody and take off work on
[03:26.440 --> 03:29.400]  Friday or take off half a day.
[03:29.400 --> 03:33.960]  This is a duty for our country against the Trans-Texas Corridor, the NAFTA Highways that
[03:33.960 --> 03:36.040]  will fund the North American Union.
[03:36.040 --> 03:39.920]  We've got Hank Gilbert joining us for about 20 minutes of the second hour to discuss this.
[03:39.920 --> 03:45.880]  We've got Jimmy Vaughn who's going to be part of some of the music and entertainment there
[03:45.880 --> 03:47.480]  coming up on Friday as well.
[03:47.480 --> 03:49.080]  He'll be joining us in studio tomorrow.
[03:49.080 --> 03:51.680]  We appreciate him coming in for that.
[03:51.680 --> 03:56.080]  So again, tell everybody you know, be there.
[03:56.080 --> 03:58.320]  We're going to be meeting downtown.
[03:58.320 --> 04:02.280]  It says at 2.30, but we need to start getting down there about 2 o'clock so we can have
[04:02.280 --> 04:07.200]  the parade down Congress to the Capitol in several hours of speeches.
[04:07.200 --> 04:10.920]  Texas Independence Day, that's when they were able to get the Capitol Mall.
[04:10.920 --> 04:15.280]  That's when they were able to, I don't think frankly the 2.30 is the best time, but let's
[04:15.280 --> 04:17.800]  not have excuses, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:17.800 --> 04:22.120]  That's when they could shut down Congress and it is Texas Independence Day.
[04:22.120 --> 04:23.640]  And so be part of this.
[04:23.640 --> 04:24.640]  Get down there.
[04:24.640 --> 04:27.240]  I absolutely, you must be there.
[04:27.240 --> 04:28.600]  And everybody needs to help us.
[04:28.600 --> 04:29.600]  Call the media.
[04:29.600 --> 04:30.600]  They need to get 100 calls a piece.
[04:30.600 --> 04:33.520]  Call the local news, national news, AP.
[04:33.520 --> 04:38.680]  Tell them to be there to get coverage on this so we can show that Texans and Americans are
[04:38.680 --> 04:41.040]  against the New World Order.
[04:41.040 --> 04:47.000]  When we get back, we're going to get into the latest developments concerning this huge
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.760]  information that's come out via the BBC and we'll give you the details if you missed the
[04:50.760 --> 04:53.200]  report and then replay those clips.
[04:53.200 --> 04:56.400]  We'll also get more into Oklahoma City and the new developments coming out there.
[04:56.400 --> 05:00.760]  There's so much breaking news and I'm so honored that my team is right in the middle of breaking
[05:00.760 --> 05:01.760]  it.
[05:01.760 --> 05:11.040]  Also, incredible news concerning Iran as the propaganda floodgates are open for the attack.
[05:11.040 --> 05:14.120]  The carriers are in line.
[05:14.120 --> 05:18.880]  Cheney takes refuge in bomb shelter after Afghan blast.
[05:18.880 --> 05:19.880]  Totally staged.
[05:19.880 --> 05:22.240]  We're now hearing Al Qaeda trying to get Blair.
[05:22.240 --> 05:24.120]  This is just total hype.
[05:24.120 --> 05:27.720]  This is part of war hysteria being ratcheted up.
[05:27.720 --> 05:32.720]  The websites are jonesreport.com, infowars.com, infowars.net.
[05:32.720 --> 05:42.280]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands.
[05:42.280 --> 05:44.520]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[05:44.520 --> 05:48.280]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[05:48.280 --> 05:53.120]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[05:53.120 --> 05:57.960]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in
[05:57.960 --> 06:00.800]  London were carried out by British intelligence.
[06:00.800 --> 06:04.640]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to
[06:04.640 --> 06:11.000]  disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.000]  much, much more.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.080]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[06:16.080 --> 06:18.360]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[06:18.360 --> 06:22.840]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[06:31.640 --> 06:35.560]  it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:35.560 --> 06:39.360]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[06:39.360 --> 06:43.240]  you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink
[06:43.240 --> 06:44.240]  the water?
[06:44.240 --> 06:47.720]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed
[06:47.720 --> 06:48.720]  to the skin.
[06:48.720 --> 06:53.880]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it
[06:53.880 --> 06:57.800]  inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[06:57.800 --> 07:01.720]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[07:01.720 --> 07:06.440]  The KDF Shower Filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes
[07:06.440 --> 07:07.440]  first.
[07:07.440 --> 07:11.840]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[07:11.840 --> 07:14.320]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[07:14.320 --> 07:15.640]  What about you?
[07:15.640 --> 07:23.760]  Here's your KDF Shower Filter, normally $49, for a special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[07:35.280 --> 07:39.640]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, what shall be the signs of thy coming and the end
[07:39.640 --> 07:40.640]  of the world?
[07:40.640 --> 07:44.920]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom
[07:44.920 --> 07:49.320]  against kingdom, and there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[07:49.320 --> 07:51.520]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[07:51.520 --> 07:55.440]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[07:55.440 --> 07:58.640]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[07:58.640 --> 08:03.240]  Second Peter says, we have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[08:03.240 --> 08:07.840]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[08:07.840 --> 08:12.600]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the Unholy Alliance.
[08:12.600 --> 08:17.120]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[08:17.120 --> 08:21.760]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world
[08:21.760 --> 08:23.280]  order, and much more.
[08:23.280 --> 08:26.040]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[08:26.040 --> 08:40.200]  Please call 1-888-211-1715, that's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[08:40.200 --> 08:44.960]  Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[08:44.960 --> 08:45.960]  You want answers?
[08:45.960 --> 08:48.160]  Well, so does he.
[08:48.160 --> 08:57.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:57.240 --> 09:02.840]  The phones are wide open, and I'll go to you at the bottom of the hour directly.
[09:02.840 --> 09:10.120]  The toll-free number to get involved on air is 1-800-259-9231, we'll be talking about
[09:10.120 --> 09:13.680]  the North American Union today, and the big fight right here in Texas to resist it.
[09:13.680 --> 09:18.600]  We'll get into the latest Oklahoma City developments as that continues to break clear evidence of
[09:18.600 --> 09:24.080]  government orchestration, and also the new incredible BBC archived footage showing how
[09:24.080 --> 09:28.800]  they were scripting the fall of Building 7 and announcing it had fallen almost 30 minutes
[09:28.800 --> 09:30.040]  before it fell.
[09:30.040 --> 09:36.880]  We'll be going over all that today, airing more of those clips and breaking it down.
[09:36.880 --> 09:44.840]  Over the weekend, the London Telegraph reported, as well as the Globe and Mail and others, headlines
[09:44.840 --> 09:50.360]  reporting that aircraft carriers are set to strike, set to hit, US aircraft carriers,
[09:50.360 --> 09:56.320]  two main battle groups, and then three other subgroups, troop carrying ships, amphibious
[09:56.320 --> 09:58.480]  attack carriers.
[09:58.480 --> 10:04.200]  You name it, total, there's really five aircraft carrier class battle groups there, two main
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.360]  line carriers, and then several of the mini carriers.
[10:09.360 --> 10:14.320]  Just amazing to see all this happening, they're announcing they found another major cache
[10:14.320 --> 10:19.920]  of Iranian component explosives.
[10:19.920 --> 10:28.560]  Clear evidence that Iran is funding the insurgency and they need to invade right now.
[10:28.560 --> 10:29.960]  Iran must be dealt with.
[10:29.960 --> 10:35.560]  Meanwhile, our glorious leader, Dick Cheney, barely survives a bomb blast.
[10:35.560 --> 10:40.640]  And of course, I'm sure it'll be linked back to Iran, a bomb.
[10:40.640 --> 10:47.960]  Of course, what was it, two years ago, Peresh Misharev, the Pakistani dictator.
[10:47.960 --> 10:52.640]  About 30 minutes after he drove over a bridge, it blew up and they announced, oh my gosh,
[10:52.640 --> 10:57.800]  Al Qaeda Taliban tried to kill the glorious leader, and then it came out about a month
[10:57.800 --> 11:04.560]  later that indeed, Pakistani intelligence, this was mainstream news, Pakistani intelligence
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.360]  had staged the bombing as a pretext to have a police state crack down and to make him
[11:10.360 --> 11:12.760]  look like he was some daring leader.
[11:12.760 --> 11:16.680]  Well, it's the same thing on this, I have no doubt.
[11:16.680 --> 11:21.480]  Cheney takes refuge in bomb shelter after Afghan blast.
[11:21.480 --> 11:25.760]  Vice President Dick Cheney was whisked into a bomb shelter immediately after a Taliban
[11:25.760 --> 11:29.000]  suicide bomber struck the main American military base.
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.520]  He was visiting in Afghanistan on Tuesday.
[11:31.520 --> 11:36.240]  Up to 14 people were killed, including one U.S. and one South Korean soldier in the
[11:36.240 --> 11:41.760]  Bagram Air Base attack, which rebels said was aimed at Cheney.
[11:41.760 --> 11:48.320]  He had been in his room at the base where he had, unexpectedly, had to stay the night
[11:48.320 --> 11:54.560]  after bad weather forced postponement of his trip to the capital Kabul about 60 kilometers
[11:54.560 --> 11:55.560]  away.
[11:55.560 --> 12:00.880]  It was the exact same type of thing in Pakistan two years ago, this is in Afghanistan.
[12:00.880 --> 12:04.880]  At 10 a.m., I heard a loud boom, Cheney said.
[12:04.880 --> 12:08.920]  Base authorities sounded a red alert, and Secret Service officials told Cheney there
[12:08.920 --> 12:12.080]  had been a suspected suicide attack.
[12:12.080 --> 12:17.680]  And this could be some real Islamic extremist that's not on the payroll doing this, but
[12:17.680 --> 12:20.880]  that's not what past MO shows.
[12:20.880 --> 12:23.480]  Here's another one.
[12:23.480 --> 12:29.240]  A new of Cheney visit Islamabad, a suicide attack at the Afghan Air Base where U.S. Vice
[12:29.240 --> 12:34.760]  President Dick Cheney was staying, shows the Taliban and al-Qaeda have penetrated local
[12:34.760 --> 12:38.680]  intelligence agencies analysts and officials said.
[12:38.680 --> 12:44.640]  The blast early on Tuesday at Bagram Air Base near Kabul also highlights the increased
[12:44.640 --> 12:50.640]  sophistication of the extremist outfits as they prepare for a feared spring offensive
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.240]  against Western troops they reported.
[12:55.240 --> 12:58.640]  But don't worry, Cheney's okay after the blast.
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.040]  Meanwhile, oh guess who else is in grave danger?
[13:03.040 --> 13:07.640]  Now we've had fake riots and plots foiled later to come out that the government staged
[13:07.640 --> 13:08.640]  it.
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.400]  They constantly every month have raids on some new safe house and it turns out there
[13:12.400 --> 13:16.560]  was no bio weapons, no terror, it's totally innocent, but that's back of the paper, small
[13:16.560 --> 13:21.960]  retraction, okay the government was mistaken, or they have street kids in Miami that for
[13:21.960 --> 13:26.960]  a year they pay over $100,000, $50,000 at one time, tell them they're Christian soldiers
[13:26.960 --> 13:30.800]  that are going to preach for Jesus, by the end of it they say we'll give you 40 something
[13:30.800 --> 13:38.160]  thousand more of you, swear allegiance to al-Qaeda and go videotape the FBI building in Miami.
[13:38.160 --> 13:47.400]  We're up in Toronto in the Royal Mounted Police mail, a bunch of fertilizer to their door
[13:47.400 --> 13:51.480]  and then that turned out to be staged, but not after there's a week of fear mongering
[13:51.480 --> 13:55.720]  and oh my gosh, they're going to wage war on us and just destroy everything.
[13:55.720 --> 14:01.160]  Well, it's the same thing with Blair, hell kind of plotted to kill Blair in front of
[14:01.160 --> 14:11.880]  the Queen, oh the Queen and Blair just so daring, oh this is strong, Tony Blair defied,
[14:11.880 --> 14:19.080]  see how brave he is, oh my gosh, Tony Blair defied an assassination threat from al-Qaeda,
[14:19.080 --> 14:23.720]  he means British intelligence, to take part in the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations
[14:23.720 --> 14:28.720]  in central London, it can be revealed for the first time, the risk to the Prime Minister
[14:28.720 --> 14:34.960]  was disclosed to a BBC documentary by Lord Stevens, oh the Lord told them, the Metropolitan
[14:34.960 --> 14:39.840]  Police Commissioner in 2002, he positioned marksmen around Buckingham Palace in readiness
[14:39.840 --> 14:46.440]  for an attack by bombers or snipers, Lord Stevens, talking for the first time about
[14:46.440 --> 14:50.280]  the alleged plot said there was a threat against the Prime Minister over the Queen's Jubilee
[14:50.280 --> 14:54.160]  period, it was an assassination threat, there was good reason to believe that the threat
[14:54.160 --> 14:59.800]  was credible, but Blair stood up bravely and said I don't care, I've got to show strength
[14:59.800 --> 15:08.240]  to the British people, I mean do you believe any of this, ladies and gentlemen, and they
[15:08.240 --> 15:13.880]  spoke to Blair and said don't do it, but he just had such courage, he didn't share,
[15:13.880 --> 15:18.320]  I mean there's hundreds of examples, oh there's a plot to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge, turns
[15:18.320 --> 15:24.880]  out it's an FBI informant, it's all made up, a lie, then mainstream news, AP, world net
[15:24.880 --> 15:30.160]  daily others reported that they were issuing fake terror alerts for political gain, every
[15:30.160 --> 15:36.520]  time something came out they got in trouble for, it's just the same story over and over
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.680]  and over again, and don't forget US generals are saying they will quit, if Bush orders
[15:40.680 --> 15:46.840]  Iran attack, this out of the times of London, some of America's most senior military commanders
[15:46.840 --> 15:50.600]  preparing a design of the White House orders, a military strike against Iran according to
[15:50.600 --> 15:55.920]  highly placed defense and intelligence sources, tensions in the Gulf region were raised, fears
[15:55.920 --> 15:59.960]  of an attack on Iran is something increasingly likely before President Bush leaves office
[15:59.960 --> 16:04.800]  the Sunday Times has learned that up to five generals and admirals are willing to resign
[16:04.800 --> 16:08.440]  rather than approve what they consider would be a reckless attack, there are four or five
[16:08.440 --> 16:14.320]  generals and admirals who know of who would resign if Bush ordered an attack on Iran a
[16:14.320 --> 16:18.160]  source with close ties to British intelligence said there is simply no stomach for it in
[16:18.160 --> 16:22.880]  the Pentagon, a lot of people question whether such an attack would be effective or even
[16:22.880 --> 16:28.000]  possible, it will be effective to escalate the crisis and create more civil war and
[16:28.000 --> 16:34.440]  more destruction and suck us into a widening third world war, and the propaganda continues
[16:34.440 --> 16:42.720]  US finds major weapons cache, two and a half weeks ago remember, oh they found very sophisticated
[16:42.720 --> 16:47.840]  super weapons, that headline itself was deceptive you read deeper in the New York Times the
[16:47.840 --> 16:52.520]  same reporter who put out the aluminum tube false report who he knows clearly an operative
[16:52.520 --> 17:00.600]  comes out and says oh my gosh they've got incredibly high powered super weapons and
[17:00.600 --> 17:07.120]  you read it's the plastic explosive cores out of 88 millimeter mortar shells which is
[17:07.120 --> 17:13.800]  literally a world war one level weapon, but no super sophisticated only Iran could do
[17:13.800 --> 17:20.280]  it, they trace the plastic residue and then you look into it and oh wait the photos they
[17:20.280 --> 17:24.760]  show they were so lazy they think were so dumb they were British 88 millimeter shells
[17:24.760 --> 17:31.120]  printed in English, well didn't matter the retraction came three days later they broke
[17:31.120 --> 17:34.720]  on Friday the Pentagon then got caught up with their operatives at the New York Times
[17:34.720 --> 17:39.520]  and broke it Sunday and said yes it's true the Sunday shows all panic and fear super
[17:39.520 --> 17:49.160]  weapons remember super weapons, mortar shells and then three days later by the Monday they
[17:49.160 --> 17:53.520]  were saying well looks like it's not true then by the next week oh it's not true well
[17:53.520 --> 17:59.920]  that doesn't matter to them, US finds major weapons cache in Iraq see they've got to be
[17:59.920 --> 18:06.360]  attacked Iran's got to be invaded AP US officials said Monday they had discovered a factory for
[18:06.360 --> 18:13.360]  assembling sophisticated roadside bombs from Iranian made components the first such facility
[18:13.360 --> 18:19.720]  uncovered in a religiously mixed province north of Baghdad the officers who displayed
[18:19.720 --> 18:25.720]  weapons reporters at a US base in the capital should define provides more evidence that
[18:25.720 --> 18:31.580]  the Iranians are providing weapons used to kill Americans they include EFPs explosive
[18:31.580 --> 18:39.680]  form projectiles oh my god super weapons and it says that fire a slug of molten metal capable
[18:39.680 --> 18:45.160]  of penetrating armored vehicles notice how they talk about a mortar shell like it's some
[18:45.160 --> 18:53.000]  type of Martian space gun that fire a slug of molten metal capable of penetrating armored
[18:53.000 --> 18:58.920]  vehicles and have been blamed for killing more than 170 US and coalition soldiers the
[18:58.920 --> 19:04.600]  display was the latest in a series of presented by the US military to bolster its allegation
[19:04.600 --> 19:12.960]  Iranian weapons are being supplied to Shiite militants Iran has denied the charge now
[19:12.960 --> 19:18.680]  we have the headline that came out a few days ago out of mainstream British newspapers
[19:18.680 --> 19:23.840]  headline US funding terror in Iran and it's admitted they're blowing up dams they're
[19:23.840 --> 19:29.280]  rocketing buildings they're shooting Iranian police they're killing Iranian troops US special
[19:29.280 --> 19:33.640]  and British special forces two and a half years ago New Yorker magazine confirms Seymour

[19:42.520 --> 19:48.280]  makes them look weak they are weak and so I mean there's just unbelievable a globalist
[19:48.280 --> 19:52.480]  funded insurgency in the west and all the way into the central area and even the eastern
[19:52.480 --> 19:56.600]  area and some of their provinces assassinations are going on they're reporting yesterday that

[25:13.080 --> 25:24.920]  welcome back let me simplify this when Adolf Hitler told the German people that they were
[25:24.920 --> 25:36.640]  fighting evil in many respects he was telling the truth now let me be clear on that Hitler
[25:36.640 --> 25:42.520]  claimed he was fighting the Soviet communist red terror evil that by the time he came to
[25:42.520 --> 25:50.360]  power in 1933 had already killed close to 20 million people and so that's why the Germans
[25:50.360 --> 25:56.240]  predominantly bought in to what he was saying he also blamed the central banks for what they
[25:56.240 --> 26:03.960]  did in the Versailles treaty with the victors England and France but he himself was evil
[26:03.960 --> 26:12.440]  as well and I bring this illustration up because the Germans were very moral people on average
[26:12.440 --> 26:18.080]  very well educated upright individuals and Hitler said as the war got worse and worse
[26:18.080 --> 26:22.200]  he got to support the troops we got to widen the war we got to attack more countries and
[26:22.200 --> 26:27.960]  he could rightfully get up and say the communists have killed millions they're evil they want
[26:27.960 --> 26:34.200]  to take your farms and private property we've got a fight for survival and so they turned
[26:34.200 --> 26:43.760]  these and he broke his pact with Stalin and attacked him well it's the same thing with
[26:43.760 --> 26:52.960]  Iran Iran is evil there's not a debate about that but compared to the globalist sophistication
[26:52.960 --> 26:58.080]  and scope of evil and actual bad things that the new world order is doing in hundreds of
[26:58.080 --> 27:05.800]  countries Iran is nothing absolutely nothing and compared to threats to this country when
[27:05.800 --> 27:13.080]  you stack Iran up against China and Pakistan and North Korea if they are no threat to this
[27:13.080 --> 27:18.480]  country but see the media and the government and the propagandas can go oh look at the
[27:18.480 --> 27:23.760]  moolahs look at their corruption look at the bad things they do look at the evil of government
[27:23.760 --> 27:27.960]  well yeah government always becomes evil as the founding fathers said and yeah you can
[27:27.960 --> 27:32.960]  point out a lot of bad things and I have no doubt they're not funding in some insurgency
[27:32.960 --> 27:36.880]  to try to get control in Iraq what else would they do you know it's a country neighboring
[27:36.880 --> 27:43.240]  them and the US and England are trying to fund insurgency the other way to take over
[27:43.240 --> 27:47.280]  their country they've got to to survive they already had 30 plus billion funded by the
[27:47.280 --> 27:52.560]  US publicly to fund Saddam to attack them over a million Iranians died in that war what
[27:52.560 --> 28:00.840]  do you expect them to do has Iran killed a million Americans no did Iran overthrow the
[28:00.840 --> 28:07.840]  US in 1953 and set up a regime of torture and extermination until 79 no you see the
[28:07.840 --> 28:12.520]  average American can't even find Iran on a map they have no history of what's happened
[28:12.520 --> 28:17.800]  in Persia no idea what the globalist and British petroleum leading the operation have done
[28:17.800 --> 28:24.800]  to those people and by the way all these threats of war and invasion actually strengthen the
[28:24.800 --> 28:31.760]  radical extremist control in that nation when they had a moderate three years ago he was
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.800]  snubbed he was told no we don't want to work with you they want war and they're gonna
[28:36.800 --> 28:42.600]  have to attack Iran barring a miracle and our economy is going to further tank and you can
[28:42.600 --> 28:48.800]  stick stickers all over your car and feel good all day you are like Germans and you're
[28:48.800 --> 28:53.640]  going to pay the price the Germans paid we're all going to pay the new old order always
[28:53.640 --> 28:58.880]  destroys who they use as their bully we're being used as a wind up toy we've been set
[28:58.880 --> 29:02.920]  up we're being demonized worldwide by the private central banks that own this country
[29:02.920 --> 29:07.640]  we're being used and it's all part of a larger plan I've been breaking down for you two years
[29:07.640 --> 29:12.440]  before the attack on Iraq and everything we told you would happen is happen because we're
[29:12.440 --> 29:22.880]  going off Pentagon and Israeli documents and that's the bottom line so just remember I
[29:22.880 --> 29:28.560]  want you and you'll still have stickers on your car you know pro war after all this happens
[29:28.560 --> 29:33.320]  after your bankrupt after your dollars worth five cents on the dollar what it was it's
[29:33.320 --> 29:38.160]  already fifty cents on the dollar and after all this happens you're still going to most

[30:15.080 --> 30:20.880]  of this nation you're going to be a slave tractor controlled and traced and there's going to

[34:51.520 --> 34:59.120]  to hit us iran's about to get us magically all this propaganda turns on as the aircraft
[34:59.120 --> 35:05.560]  carriers line up and those carriers can't stay there more than four or five months and most
[35:05.560 --> 35:11.120]  the experts are saying look for the attack in the next few months so here we are at
[35:11.120 --> 35:20.320]  the edge of this happening it's just it's just disgusting here's roiders u.s. developing
[35:20.320 --> 35:26.360]  contingency plan to bomb iran despite the bush administration's insistence like they
[35:26.360 --> 35:31.280]  did with iraq that has no plans to go to war with iran a pentagon panel has been created
[35:31.280 --> 35:35.800]  to plan a bombing attack that could be implemented within 24 hours of getting the go ahead from
[35:35.800 --> 35:40.880]  president george w bush the new worker magazine reported in its latest issue the special
[35:40.880 --> 35:46.120]  planning group was established within the office of the joint chiefs of staff in recent months
[35:46.120 --> 35:50.960]  according to an unidentified former u.s. intelligence official cited in the article
[35:50.960 --> 35:56.160]  by investigative reporter c more harsh in the march fourth issue the panel initially focused
[35:56.160 --> 36:00.200]  on destroying iran's nuclear facilities and on regime change but has more recently been
[36:00.200 --> 36:05.680]  directed to identify targets in iran that may be involved in supplying or aiding militants
[36:05.680 --> 36:15.160]  in iraq according to an air force advisor at the pentagon consultant who were not identified
[36:15.160 --> 36:20.760]  and of course it's the same office of special plans that cooked up the w.m.d. reports out
[36:20.760 --> 36:32.000]  of iraq they've just reconstituted it under the same name and it came out what three weeks
[36:32.000 --> 36:38.960]  ago that it's going to be a much wider attack this from pentagon officials hitting hundreds
[36:38.960 --> 36:43.800]  and hundreds and hundreds of targets all of their major ships their destroyers their
[36:43.800 --> 36:49.400]  smaller ships they have these oil rigs these converted oil rigs out in the persian gulf
[36:49.400 --> 36:55.600]  that are military blisters of weaponry those are to be destroyed their entire airport system
[36:55.600 --> 37:01.120]  is to be bombed their main infrastructure all their major military bases ground forces
[37:01.120 --> 37:08.440]  were talking massive continued bombardment blowing iran back into the stone age and
[37:08.440 --> 37:14.440]  if iran lifts a finger and fights back in any way they'll be called terrorist anyone
[37:14.440 --> 37:19.240]  who fights back is a terrorist and here in america now you're hearing that basically
[37:19.240 --> 37:23.520]  all crimes terrorism if you raise your hand while cops are beating you with billy clubs
[37:23.520 --> 37:31.600]  it's terrorism if you're selling knockoff rubik's cubes it's terrorism downloading music is
[37:31.600 --> 37:36.960]  listed as terrorism just every all misdemeanors are terrorism under section 802 of the u.s.
[37:36.960 --> 37:44.400]  a patriot act think i'm joking go look it up so they're gearing up in a massive massive
[37:44.400 --> 37:49.600]  way and israel has gotten three gulf states to clear an air corridor for them to fly through
[37:49.600 --> 37:56.360]  to start the attack on iran now will we see a false flag staged event in europe or the
[37:56.360 --> 38:04.200]  u.s. or in the middle east to kick this off yes will generals threatening to resign will
[38:04.200 --> 38:11.240]  the fact that every mainline expert in military affairs is saying this will be a disaster
[38:11.240 --> 38:18.480]  will that stop them i don't know we should hit our knees and pray to god but that's basically
[38:18.480 --> 38:23.760]  where we stand on that later i'm gonna get into the huge breaking news on the bbc for
[38:23.760 --> 38:29.960]  just to recap it archived footage from live bbc surface yesterday and it's up on prison
[38:29.960 --> 38:37.800]  planet dot com and info wars dot com right now of the bbc twenty five plus minutes before
[38:37.800 --> 38:48.760]  building seven known as the solemn brothers building fell and it's four fifty something
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.920]  and they start announcing from the bbc headquarters in london that the solemn brothers building
[38:53.920 --> 39:00.880]  seven has fallen then five six minutes later they cut to a live reporter on the ground
[39:00.880 --> 39:05.920]  approximately twenty minutes before it falls and she's saying the solemn brothers building
[39:05.920 --> 39:10.440]  again that's the name of seven inches we listen one two three four five six and seven seven
[39:10.440 --> 39:15.080]  was its designated number in the complex but its name was solemn brothers building we have
[39:15.080 --> 39:19.360]  links to all that on the website you know to new york skyscrapers you can go look at
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.240]  them all it's called the solemn brothers building shows building seven or the it's a solemn
[39:23.240 --> 39:27.680]  brothers building or building sevens is named says both because there's denials now that
[39:27.680 --> 39:31.680]  that's what the solemn brothers is the debunkers will just because they know the general public
[39:31.680 --> 39:37.400]  is dumbed down and mindless so they just say oh no that's another building people will
[39:37.400 --> 39:43.080]  hear okay fine it's not true and they won't check it's just any way to deny it's real
[39:43.080 --> 39:49.840]  that's that's how they operate fine you're gonna get to have the wages of being an ignoramus
[39:49.840 --> 39:53.680]  of not caring and not being involved you're gonna be enslaved you know if you buy lies
[39:53.680 --> 39:58.320]  and propaganda long enough you will be enslaved it's simple real simple land of the dumb
[39:58.320 --> 40:03.480]  down cowers no longer land of the free home of the brave sorry to have to say that sticking
[40:03.480 --> 40:07.800]  a plastic desecrated flag made in china on your card doesn't make you a patriot that flag
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.600]  symbolizes the bill of rights and constitution that's being put to the sword that's being
[40:11.600 --> 40:18.920]  burned at the stake let me get back so I can go to your calls it they cut to her and she
[40:18.920 --> 40:22.880]  talked several times about the solemn building has collapsed it's collapsed and she steps
[40:22.880 --> 40:28.520]  aside and looks and they zoom in on building seven it's standing there clear as day building
[40:28.520 --> 40:37.960]  seven clear as the nose on your face and then as soon as this got reported they jerked
[40:37.960 --> 40:41.920]  it off google in real time then they jerked it down again then they jerked it off youtube
[40:41.920 --> 40:45.200]  and then other people started uploading and who'd gotten it jerking and jerking and taking
[40:45.200 --> 40:51.280]  it down again we've never seen a move this fast real time we're gonna play that later
[40:51.280 --> 40:55.360]  in the next hour and get more into it after Hank Gilbert joins us for about 20 30 minutes
[40:55.360 --> 40:59.160]  talk about the nap to superhighways and a big rally against it coming up on friday right
[40:59.160 --> 41:03.000]  now let's go to drew in vermont drew you're on the air thanks for holding
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.760]  Alex thanks for taking my call I just wanted to call and let your listeners know that on
[41:09.760 --> 41:17.800]  March 6th in vermont that's a town meeting day that's one of our last I guess forms
[41:17.800 --> 41:24.640]  of direct democracy in this country and the city of burlington has got it on the ballot
[41:24.640 --> 41:32.160]  to demand that our congressional representatives demand a new thorough and truly independent
[41:32.160 --> 41:37.000]  forensic investigation that fully addresses the many questions surrounding the tragic
[41:37.000 --> 41:44.640]  events of september 11th and if you're listening would like to maybe get on a burlington free
[41:44.640 --> 41:51.280]  press dot com and send in some letters to the editor just to get the the issue in the
[41:51.280 --> 41:55.600]  in the town space I think that would be a huge help well for those that are listening
[41:55.600 --> 42:01.480]  go oh what's some town calling for a real investigation going to do it's going to be
[42:01.480 --> 42:05.920]  in the local newspapers it's going to be on local tv it's going to be seen prominently
[42:05.920 --> 42:12.000]  at the city council it's going to get folks talking getting this mainstream and similar
[42:12.000 --> 42:18.400]  things are happening coast to coast and that's why this matters and that's why this is important
[42:18.400 --> 42:24.360]  yeah and I just want to thank you for all your help you've been a huge help to me in
[42:24.360 --> 42:30.560]  waking other people up out here and this has been a huge week just listening to your show
[42:30.560 --> 42:39.920]  about oklahoma city and you know the new bbc revelations as far as their preemptive announcement
[42:39.920 --> 42:45.600]  of the billing collapse so you're doing a great job and the public is so dumb down that
[42:45.600 --> 42:50.800]  like on dig dot com and other websites they're attacking us saying the video isn't real they're
[42:50.800 --> 42:56.640]  attacking saying well there's no time stamp clearly it's before five o'clock then it's
[42:56.640 --> 43:01.400]  after five she's standing there saying it's collapsed by name and it hasn't collapsed
[43:01.400 --> 43:07.760]  but they're just in total denial yeah I mean if and that's a signal of our strength I think
[43:07.760 --> 43:12.320]  if that's there they're only really a defense against these questions that shows that we're
[43:12.320 --> 43:17.240]  winning listen I appreciate your call let me just mention this because I want I want to
[43:17.240 --> 43:22.800]  do a test here this is how it works dig dot com is rated in the top 50 websites in the
[43:22.800 --> 43:29.120]  world give me an idea how big that is the the tens of millions that read it today the
[43:29.120 --> 43:33.160]  drudge report who claims he's the biggest things in sliced bread is 500 and something
[43:33.160 --> 43:38.040]  world that daily is 1000 something rated in a prison planet is 6000 and something info
[43:38.040 --> 43:44.640]  wars 12000 and something info wars dot net 40,000 and this is the ratings and again most
[43:44.640 --> 43:49.840]  major town newspapers take the austin american statesman it's like 15,000 or something rush
[43:49.840 --> 43:58.520]  limbaugh is like 20,000 now on the web okay they're plunging we're exploding for the first
[43:58.520 --> 44:02.720]  few weeks our listeners what you do is you dig the article you read the article on prison
[44:02.720 --> 44:07.280]  planet or info wars you think it's an important article and you click the dig link and then
[44:07.280 --> 44:11.400]  you register as a dig user and then you vote it up and it's supposed to go to the main
[44:11.400 --> 44:21.160]  page I don't know 10 times or so a few weeks ago our stories got on the main page of dig
[44:21.160 --> 44:26.240]  and then dig admittedly banned prison planet dot com anything with prison planet dot com
[44:26.240 --> 44:31.880]  and it was then banned keywordy prison planet dot com in anything it's banned we're also
[44:31.880 --> 44:37.120]  banned from the search engine you can't find us on the search engine people emailed they
[44:37.120 --> 44:42.320]  called they freaked out because it's supposedly it's all about you know this democratizing
[44:42.320 --> 44:45.920]  news what you think is most important goes to the main page well they're scrolling with
[44:45.920 --> 44:53.080]  it they said we were spam they said that we were fake news yeah breaking major news stories
[44:53.080 --> 44:58.440]  having lawyers on breaking key information they just said it's not real it's spam well
[44:58.440 --> 45:03.640]  people complained and so they allowed us to they allowed submitters you can submit our
[45:03.640 --> 45:10.280]  stories to start reposting but then we started running up against people who would come post
[45:10.280 --> 45:15.880]  in the message board on the story that oh don't worry we're all digging you down because
[45:15.880 --> 45:20.840]  according to the algorithm how it works less people can vote against it than vote for it
[45:20.840 --> 45:25.600]  but if a bunch of people still vote against it it it buries it and kicks you off their
[45:25.600 --> 45:31.440]  site or puts you into the buried area and then you're kicked off so we can have two thousand
[45:31.440 --> 45:37.120]  fifteen hundred digs there's stuff on their main page with two hundred digs yeah I mean
[45:37.120 --> 45:40.200]  you I mean you get a couple thousand in one day you're guaranteed front page where tens
[45:40.200 --> 45:46.680]  of millions go no cheated us again we won't let us up there and frankly I don't think
[45:46.680 --> 45:50.560]  that dig users could be digging us down this much I think it stays they've already banned
[45:50.560 --> 45:57.480]  us before so let's test it go to prisonplanet.com right now it's the third story on the right
[45:57.480 --> 46:04.240]  hand side it's the original article that we put out yesterday BBC building seven revelations
[46:04.240 --> 46:09.280]  it's got like twelve hundred digs on it and again they're voting against us taking our
[46:09.280 --> 46:14.960]  digs away go in there overdrive them register push it over the edge let's see what they
[46:14.960 --> 46:20.040]  do let's test this now remember what Google did and they put out a press release and
[46:20.040 --> 46:23.960]  admitted they did it but it was an accident they claim of course it wasn't because they
[46:23.960 --> 46:28.720]  weren't doing it to other videos then they should be doing it to other truth or videos
[46:28.720 --> 46:33.320]  other patriot videos there were like fifteen different versions a few months ago now it's
[46:33.320 --> 46:37.160]  over fifty of terror storm and people uploaded they just uploaded there's all these different
[46:37.160 --> 46:41.240]  postings of it and one would have five hundred something thousand one three hundred something
[46:41.240 --> 46:45.840]  thousand and every time it go over about five hundred thousand they would erase they would
[46:45.840 --> 46:50.760]  leave the posting there of my film but they would erase all the comments and they would
[46:50.760 --> 46:56.080]  erase our but back to zero why is that important because we were going into the top one hundred
[46:56.080 --> 47:01.320]  in the top ten that's where most people go to watch then it's a snowball they were basically
[47:01.320 --> 47:06.040]  it's like you're winning the indy five hundred your two laps ahead and for no reason they
[47:06.040 --> 47:11.000]  make you park and let all the other cars get ten laps ahead of you every time you're winning
[47:11.000 --> 47:16.080]  now we know what happens we got word of it but by the time I was watching it they did
[47:16.080 --> 47:20.960]  it two more times so we called them they put out a press release saying oh it's an accident
[47:20.960 --> 47:27.040]  we're sorry so again I don't care about being number one on some website or number one on
[47:27.040 --> 47:36.120]  google just for the trophy or you know the piston cup what I want is being on it's basically
[47:36.120 --> 47:42.520]  now it's so big it's bigger than being on CNN to be in the top ten or so it's it's more
[47:42.520 --> 47:47.720]  viewers more readers it's basically like they took us off national television we in this
[47:47.720 --> 47:51.840]  democratized system as they call it and is a pure democracy what you watch is what goes
[47:51.840 --> 47:56.720]  to the head they cheat us and make us go back to the end of the line it's like you're running
[47:56.720 --> 48:01.240]  a marathon and you're two minutes ahead everybody else and they come up and say sorry you've
[48:01.240 --> 48:05.520]  got to go to the end of the line now and they fly you by helicopter to the end of the line
[48:05.520 --> 48:08.840]  for you to start and then you get ahead of people again and they say no we're going to
[48:08.840 --> 48:12.880]  take you back again to the back of the line and then you get ahead again and they say
[48:12.880 --> 48:17.640]  no we're going to bring you back to the end of the line again and it's because it's because
[48:17.640 --> 48:22.200]  they're scared and they should be scared okay listen to me punks you're not going to stop
[48:22.200 --> 48:26.480]  us you understand you sent com operatives on dig and sent coms announced they got bloggers
[48:26.480 --> 48:30.640]  posting all over and staging stuff it's the same guys same comments you'll see the same
[48:30.640 --> 48:36.960]  guys comments on a thousand message boards I'm not kidding it just everywhere they just
[48:36.960 --> 48:41.480]  that they got a few hundred people just posting posting posting different identities on the
[48:41.480 --> 48:48.200]  web voting us down doing all this and it's not going to work because people are just
[48:48.200 --> 48:53.560]  going to learn that prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and infowars.net and joesport.com are being
[48:53.560 --> 48:58.360]  censored they're going to find out why because it's powerful information so they're pulling
[48:58.360 --> 49:03.920]  the videos they're they're pulling our numbers they're not going to soft dig wherever we find
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.400]  a chink in the armor to reach the people we win whenever we're able to put our information
[49:08.400 --> 49:13.960]  out the truth wins so they try to keep us from getting on the field they're cheaters
[49:13.960 --> 49:21.800]  but I don't expect them to play fair let's talk to John in Texas go ahead John hi Alex
[49:21.800 --> 49:26.560]  yes sir I'm Paul from Houston the Kim Trill Chapel of America yes every time I look up
[49:26.560 --> 49:31.520]  in the sky all I see is the artificial Kim Trill it's nutritious the government loves

[49:39.120 --> 49:46.160]  what it is but nobody wants to talk about it there's a lot of shows to talk about it
[49:46.160 --> 49:49.640]  we talk about it all the time I know I'm saying officially I mean it's our local media don't
[49:49.640 --> 49:55.040]  want to talk about it the newspapers I called up Ellington Field the Air National Guard
[49:55.040 --> 50:00.640]  base here and they said well we don't know nothing about it's not our planes so well
[50:00.640 --> 50:06.000]  here's the deal eight years ago you know I keep saying eight years ago I guess it started
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.960]  in 96 11 years ago man times really I just keep saying eight years for the last few years
[50:10.960 --> 50:18.760]  no it's now almost 11 years 11 years ago you never saw a trail last more than 30 seconds
[50:18.760 --> 50:23.280]  and then they were always above 20,000 feet now they're at 4,000 5,000 feet they're there

[50:35.560 --> 50:40.240]  with these trails you hardly ever see blue skies anymore I've looked up in the sky and
[50:40.240 --> 50:45.400]  just about every cloud up there been man made at times it's just well the government loves
[50:45.400 --> 50:48.920]  us sir and you know they admit that they've had projects to manipulate the weather and
[50:48.920 --> 50:52.960]  do other things but it's okay they know best let's just trust them let's take all the vaccines
[50:52.960 --> 50:57.520]  with live cancer viruses and let's use cell phones up against our heads when all the evidence
[50:57.520 --> 51:03.760]  shows it causes massive cancers and let's drink aspartame and let's eat msg let's give
[51:03.760 --> 51:09.160]  our six-year-old cell phones and let them fry their brains and let's just it's all wonderful

[51:14.080 --> 51:20.360]  pan-american union some prosperity or something the security and prosperity partnership ain't
[51:20.360 --> 51:24.480]  that sort of like the greater East Asia core prosperity spirit of the Japanese try to impose

[55:52.800 --> 56:00.720]  from mexico fornia you know I was paying my state tax the other day and I came online
[56:00.720 --> 56:06.320]  to ask for a relationship test and it said you know a person had to be single married
[56:06.320 --> 56:11.600]  and was a citizen or national united states or resident of the united states canada or
[56:11.600 --> 56:20.200]  mexico and then yesterday we get a little document from our heads of chief in the department
[56:20.200 --> 56:25.600]  of social services in california stating that um the discontinued discontinued the policy
[56:25.600 --> 56:31.080]  of suspending investigations or recommendation dismissal or positions of adoption cases involving
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.880]  noncitizens suspected of being in the united states without lawful immigration status in
[56:35.880 --> 56:43.240]  other words green light on go ahead oh yes the private corporations the banks the government
[56:43.240 --> 56:50.200]  they're saying illegal aliens are literally above the law again they tell the major apartment
[56:50.200 --> 56:54.920]  complexes in secret deals with the feds because other people that work there are inside you
[56:54.920 --> 56:59.200]  are to let them have as many as they want staying in the apartment but if citizens have extra
[56:59.200 --> 57:05.080]  people staying you are to evict them everything is being done to incentivize bringing the
[57:05.080 --> 57:13.880]  third world population here yeah and with going into the tax part definitely it's integrating
[57:13.880 --> 57:20.760]  our money and monetary system with them as well now you say you work as a social worker
[57:20.760 --> 57:24.800]  you work for the county or city or state actually I work for the county and I'm just a pencil
[57:24.800 --> 57:32.040]  pusher I understand so so this is big news I wish you'd fax me this new directive or
[57:32.040 --> 57:36.520]  email it to me and you can blackout your name or your office number but but this just fits
[57:36.520 --> 57:40.480]  in with everything else we already know be clear with the listeners they're saying leave
[57:40.480 --> 57:46.800]  the illegal aliens alone specifically how specifically like if a person wants to adopt
[57:46.800 --> 57:53.280]  right or put in a petition of adoption there to go ahead and regardless of their status
[57:53.280 --> 57:59.600]  as a citizen or a resident here in California they go ahead and just go ahead and continue
[57:59.600 --> 58:04.640]  with homesteading in other words you know they can't deny it or dismiss it based on
[58:04.640 --> 58:12.000]  their status as a as a citizen here in California now before to adopt a child I'm not adopted
[58:12.000 --> 58:17.560]  my sister is adopted and I was 14 when they adopted her so I know the process I mean they
[58:17.560 --> 58:23.720]  basically would go over you with a fine tooth comb oh yeah forever but now it's just hey
[58:23.720 --> 58:28.720]  you don't even have to be a citizen no you just forget it if it's a if it's a lord if
[58:28.720 --> 58:32.920]  it's an illegal alien you just let them do whatever they want pretty much and you know
[58:32.920 --> 58:39.920]  how can we check you know like criminal background checks in Mexico or which is totally reasonable
[58:39.920 --> 58:45.240]  if somebody's going to be adopting a child they need to be vetted oh but no no no no

[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:25.280]  on the air thanks for holding hello hi oh hi I'm so happy to hear from you and I believe
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:31.360]  you're a god fan well I'm just doing my job ma'am what's on your mind well I called because
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.560]  I believe like you believe that these are evil powers that have a hold of our country
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:44.560]  in our the world and I was wondering if what you think this about coming up with a small
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:51.600]  maybe not even a 60 second prayer to put out on your website to have everyone pray that
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:56.720]  is has access to it to pray every day at the same time wherever they are in the world and
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:03.200]  maybe in unison our voice maybe we'll have more power to God to help us that sounds like
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:09.000]  a good idea I just don't know not a big prayer writer I usually pray from the heart privately
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.800]  but it's an interesting idea what else is on your mind I want to thank you my husband
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:20.520]  I took our 17-year-old to you and Jack blood and Mr. Humphries at UT and I went up to you
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.800]  and introduced my son to you and he asked you about how to verify the sources and so forth
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:30.000]  and you told him just to Google and make sure the sources were legitimate and he started
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.520]  doing that but that night when we got home he's been handing stuff over to his teacher
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:39.280]  that school here and they're actually reading it and going to websites and looking stuff
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.640]  up so I think you know you put a little bit of kernel in his brain there and it's working
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.960]  terrifically fantastic it's all of us doing little things like that the globalist didn't
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.080]  build their crime syndicate overnight we're not going to tear it down overnight it is
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:58.400]  a process and that process is ongoing good to hear from you I appreciate your call Kathy
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:05.400]  Aaron in Minnesota you're on the air yeah good sir I just wanted to say thanks to the
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:11.040]  BBC for the mortar shell they gave us here for the info war and those who just joined
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:18.600]  us boil down in your view what the story means to make it real simple I just think it's a
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.440]  great way to open up people's eyes so I haven't seen anything yet you know because the time
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:27.120]  frame I don't think really has much of a bearance on everything you know people want to say
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.560]  you know oh there's no time frame signature you know on the video but I don't think that
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.280]  really matters because I mean you can see the woman talking about you know the building
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.000]  just came down yeah I think it was a distraction that we even put that in the article but say
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.400]  la vie I mean the point is they're saying building seven is collapsed and there is behind her
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.760]  it hasn't collapsed and then they zoom in on it yep so I don't think the time really
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.040]  has any bearance on the situation just look at the building while she talks about it being
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.200]  on the ground you know and that fits in with the police and firemen and others hours before
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.560]  they said we're going to pull it we're going to bring it down we got cops and they're bringing
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:05.480]  it down get back it's going to blow up and we've I mean so it just fits in with everything
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:10.560]  else yep I think it should be a great eye opener for you know people that are so don't
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.880]  want to believe it is a huge eye opener and people need to go get it off prison planet
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.640]  dot com and info wars and get it out to everybody the problem is I looked at some of the message
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.480]  boards doing some research last night and some people don't even understand what they go
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.600]  what does that mean what does it mean that it hadn't collapsed when she said it would
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.440]  you know they can't even think at a base level yeah I think a lot of them maybe haven't even
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:34.400]  seen the video yet because like you said they pulled off as quick as people posted that you
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.120]  know I think maybe some of them are just going from people explaining the video and a lot
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:41.960]  of them have never even heard of building 7 they're like building what exactly you know
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.640]  and that's going to bring a whole light to building 7 which is great because like you
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:49.240]  said a lot of people don't know about it and now they will and once this video starts
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.000]  staying up at more places you know once it gets hosted somewhere we're trying to pull
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.960]  down every two minutes you know more people be able to see it's just going to take a few
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:01.240]  days because you know they're pulling off yeah as of 30 minutes ago we've gotten another
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:06.680]  clip of it live up on the prison planet dot com story we'll see if it's still there but

[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:51.200]  continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network well he ran for the head of the department
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:57.080]  of agriculture in texas and he got very close to winning i think election fraud which is
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:03.520]  clearly going on in the state with the different uh... die bold and hard inner seven machines
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:10.120]  kept him out because of the poll show that he should have won like like many others but
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.200]  that doesn't matter the point is he's taking action and he is a uh... multi-generation
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.240]  texas rancher right here in the great state of texas and if you're listening in colorada
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:27.920]  new york minnesota florida california or again indiana kansas it this is happening everywhere
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:33.200]  foreign corporations are having our roads basically given to them as part of globalization
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.160]  that they're handed over to destroy the sovereignty they're gonna put it toll roads on existing
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:43.600]  roads they always try to lie about it and now they're doing it right here in texas we
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.840]  have the wrong documents there texas also is implemented through the feds still voluntary
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:55.160]  in the rest of country uh... the national identification of the national animal identification
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:00.400]  system also the premises identification and uh... in the rest of country they're telling
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:06.080]  four eight students to be in four eight you got a register your family's property in this
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.640]  to show animals you got a register in the school says it's the law there's no law it's
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:16.520]  a fraud just like there's no law to take vaccines another fraud they're trying to tell vets
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:21.400]  that they'll refuse care if you haven't registered and then that means thousand plus dollar fines
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.360]  if you don't tell them in two days your cows died it'll cost you as much as a chicken cost
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.760]  to tag them within big producers they get to buy premises ideas and don't have to tag
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:37.560]  all their stuff this of course was written by the big agribusinesses to drive the small
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.840]  farmers and ranchers out of business period that's the name of the game and uh... so the
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.720]  toll roads the national animal identification system the national premises identification
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:56.120]  system all of this is going to be fought texas independence day march second this friday
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:00.400]  and here to tell you about it is the master of ceremonies in the fellow that helped organize
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:07.480]  all of this hank gilbert hank thank you for coming on thank you alex everybody needs
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:12.200]  to get out there tell folks why we're having this event and basically well what the lineup
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:17.800]  is where everybody needs to report to coming up at two fifteen uh... two thirty uh... on
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:23.200]  the friday there's also an event coming up on thursday tell folks about it well on friday
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:29.120]  we're going to have a march of congress avenue that's going to start around one thirty uh...
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:35.920]  we're inviting people to bring tractors animals hold nine yards uh... and we have people coming
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:42.400]  from all over the state we have people coming from the dc area and i think we have people
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:47.760]  coming out of indiana and florida and a few other places uh... and then we're going to
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.760]  uh... march to the capital and then on the capital ground around two thirty we're going
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:59.920]  to have a rally and alex you know and the people uh... listed know that their rallies
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:06.520]  are effective in in one area and that's body count the more people you turn out the more
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:13.160]  serious the people in the in the state capitals take it because those are potential voters
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:18.440]  uh... so it's imperative that we have tens of thousands of people in austin texas on
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:24.200]  friday for this rally uh... and it really looks good i mean a lot of the organizations
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:30.920]  have uh... anti-toe organizations uh... have jumped in on this uh... teamsters union
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:38.840]  aflco steelworkers uh... the trucking associations the biking groups they've all joined into
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:43.720]  this and and we hope to have thousands of people there and it really would mean a whole
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:49.240]  lot to have people from out of state there because like you mentioned uh... this is
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.760]  going on everywhere i get the calls and emails from people all over the country when i do
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:58.400]  one of these shows and we've got the same thing going here and there's no doubt there's
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:04.200]  no doubt texas is the frontline no we're there we're the kid with a lynch pinned to this
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:09.920]  whole thing you know we never got the boat on after cat or any other of those afters
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:18.720]  and and none of those can reach the desired effect that the corporate brokers and uh...
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:25.920]  the big money politicians want them to achieve without this roadway this roadway is that
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:34.480]  is the key that that paved those trade agreements in the perpetuity in this country and we texas
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:41.840]  is the lynch pinned to the entire thing because we are the connecting point to closest to the
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:48.520]  ports in mexico that make this highway work and so it's imperative that we stop it here
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.720]  not only for texas but for this country and let me be clear on something here this is
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:59.600]  literally the cancer trying to establish itself because it's come out in the spp documents
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:05.440]  of the four year request that have been honored that they're going to use uh... by taxing
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.880]  eight thousand miles of roads in texas alone to fund road building in mexico and on up
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:16.680]  into minnesota with the nafta superhighway that's not just the i-35 everybody's heard
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:23.800]  about but eighty two other major roads we have got to be here and as one of a world
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.320]  war two that we interviewed for the film we're making said if we stop it here in texas we
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.520]  stop the new world order so we've got to stop it here in texas that's true and you know
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:40.360]  what it's really made its way to washington in a quiet kind of way uh... because a couple
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:45.520]  of weeks ago the u.s. department of transportation came out with a memo basically wanting to
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:52.760]  fast track ttc sixty nine or they refer to it as i sixty nine i want to fast track it
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.280]  because it is going to be the nafta superhighway now now they've got articles in canada
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.760]  and in washington making fun of us saying it doesn't even exist as the billboards are
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:07.800]  up everywhere showing a good old boy on a cowboy hat going i love the toll roads i love the
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:13.120]  trans texas corridor and when they're building the things they're grabbing existing roads
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.880]  and then you call congress and they deny it's even happening
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:20.920]  oh yeah they're taking a blind eye to it and trying to turn a deaf ear to it in washington
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.760]  even though they know that it exists that should make people even matter it's like
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:28.520]  it's alex jose hank jobert say the sun came up and they go there's no such thing as a
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.880]  son never seen it never heard of it
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.120]  well i'll tell you that the ground swell movement going on in this state and i think
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.200]  that's one of the things that prompted
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.920]  the department of transportation to come out
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:43.760]  uh... with that fast track uh...
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.320]  suggestion and then the toll road company of the month ago bought up almost all the
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.960]  little papers on the key routes for these roads are going to be they're playing hard
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.720]  ball sure they are uh... you know what to what is kind of interesting at the state audit
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.600]  report that just came out a couple of days ago
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.400]  where tax dollars tried to manipulate invoices and they've tried to manipulate figures
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.840]  and according to the audit
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.480]  dot report
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.720]  you know the estimation that we were given for all eight of these toll roads in texas
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.400]  by rick williamson
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:20.520]  was anywhere from a hundred and forty five two hundred eighty four billion dollars
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.440]  which automatically makes me wonder why we've been talking about that no state
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.960]  money supposed to go into it and let's be clear that's really what happens the
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.280]  tax dot documents to christmas is ago
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:34.040]  got released on december twenty fourth it was in the austrian american statesman
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:37.640]  internal tax dot documents saying not for publication secret
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.560]  and it said we've got plenty of extra money why are we basically giving them
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.680]  the roads
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.840]  folks we pay to upkeep the roads private corporations just get them
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.040]  because they paid off the politicians this would be like if i went down and paid
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.040]  the governor a million dollars
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:57.240]  to give me uh... you know ten billion dollars worth of of of state property
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.760]  i mean this is incredible
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:02.360]  well the state audit report was really fascinating because
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.600]  using text dot figures
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.520]  they found discrepancy in nineteen of twenty five invoices
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.560]  uh... where they were trying to bill cough
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.280]  associated with ptc thirty five
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.040]  the other road projects
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:20.840]  but based on the state audit report ptc thirty five alone
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:25.320]  is going to cost an estimated one hundred and five point something billion
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.800]  dollar and they plan to pay for that with
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.120]  tolls ladies and gentlemen know
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:34.680]  and it's going to pay for roads in mexico now where people going to meet up on
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.800]  friday i mean obviously most uh... folks are
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:41.480]  who gets to be in the parade where anybody anybody who wants to be

[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.560]  yeah and at that time i was totally outraged by that as were a lot of uh
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:37.720]  canadiens and uh i wrote a letter to our prime minister up here and to the
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:41.480]  and to stockwell days the minister of public safety and emergency preparedness
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.400]  which is like the equivalent of the homeland security there
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:48.600]  and i also posted a form letter all over the web
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.360]  asking people from everywhere to to write to them and complain about your

[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.360]  extended length of time it has taken to reply to your concern
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.480]  which you sent me some months ago a combination of factors including the
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:36.600]  need of my officials to explore fully the matter you raised
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.520]  along with the requirement to assess the response in the light of similar and
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:44.760]  sometimes competing factors added to the sheer volume of requests
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:49.560]  which come to me uh as created has created a delay which is not appropriate
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.720]  i'm pleased to uh at least i can finally respond
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.200]  the privacy act precludes me from discussing the details of mr jones
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.640]  border clearance without his written consent
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:05.640]  however i can provide you the following general information about the can of the
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:10.520]  border services agency cbsa cbsa plays an important
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:14.200]  role in the law enforcement community as border officers are uniquely
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.600]  positioned to interview travelers and
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:20.360]  importers and to examine personal and commercial goods entering and leaving
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.440]  canada the challenge of our mandate is to ensure
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:27.960]  that only admissible people and goods have access to canada
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:31.800]  the cbsa takes seriously its commitment to provide high quality service to
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.000]  travelers while ensuring that canadian society is protected
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.600]  through the person responsible enforcement of our laws
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:41.960]  uh... i can assure you that a considerable part of our officers training
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:44.920]  is devoted to topics such as interviewing techniques
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:48.280]  and interaction with the public the cbsa makes
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:53.720]  every effort to convey to its officers uh the necessity of being sensitive and
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:56.520]  responsive to the needs of the traveling public
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:00.920]  while performing their duties thank you again for so i guess that hurts yelling
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:05.480]  and cussing at people that seems to be the case
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.480]  now that they did say the one thing that i picked up in there is that without
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:12.440]  your consent they would not be disclosing anything else
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.040]  so maybe that's something you want to consider
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:18.920]  well i mean what are they going to say they just interrogated me forever
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:21.720]  about the belterberg group meeting and what was i planning

[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:30.280]  criminal records turned back at the border
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:33.880]  and it goes on to say there was a time not long ago when a trip across the
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.360]  border from the united states to canada was accompanied
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:41.400]  with a wink and a wave of the driver's license those days are over
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:45.000]  take the case of fifty five-year-old lake tahoe resident
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.960]  craig fellish stopped at the border in vancouver this month at the start of a
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:54.360]  planned five-day ski trip he was sent back to the united states because of a
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:41:00.120]  dui conviction seven years ago but they didn't just have his car turned around
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:04.200]  that took him into custody not that he had any idea what was going on when he
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.680]  was told at customs your next stop is immigration
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.280]  and it says fellish was ushered into a room there must have been 75 people in
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:16.200]  line he says we were there for three hours one woman was in tears as a guy
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.040]  was sent back for having a medical marijuana card
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:24.600]  i felt like a felon when an ankle bracelet well

[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.040]  and in the grid they are oh don't worry there'll be lots of crackdowns on them
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:02.280]  later along with everybody else but um and it goes on to the example of this

[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.760]  you wanted to laugh at us and make jokes about all this
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:12.280]  you're going to find out all right i'm ranting
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:18.440]  welcome to the new world of border security i'm suspecting americans are
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:21.400]  turning up at the canadian border expecting clear sailing
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.000]  only to find that their past sometimes their distant past is suddenly an issue
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.240]  now the u.s is what set this up and it's now the law you've got to have a passport
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:33.240]  to leave to go to counter mexico and there didn't have to be an apb or an arrest
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:37.000]  if they just put you on a list you can't leave the country and they're saying
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.600]  misdemeanor convictions you won't be able to leave
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.680]  and there's nobody you can complain to they'll might be one or two news articles
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:47.880]  about it if it gets bad enough and you'll just submit
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:53.480]  you're now prisoners anyone who wants to come here can come in no problem
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:59.560]  but if you want to leave you can forget it you wanted to be slaves you're going
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:03.640]  to get to be slaves you wanted to sit around and
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:08.040]  snicker and laugh at all i can't wait to all these slack jaw punks
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:10.600]  go on the message boards and make jokes about what we cover
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:14.120]  i can't wait till they got bad credit or some misdemeanor in their past
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:17.560]  and you're and you think you're gonna fly down to the bahamas or you're gonna go
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:22.040]  on some trip to mexico but you're so cowardly you'll make excuses and just
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:25.320]  whine about it and you'll just go home and go back to watching your tv and
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:28.760]  make excuses for it but then it's going to get worse
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:32.840]  and one day you're going to cry you're going to cry in your bed at night
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:36.840]  wishing you'd have done something you fat hog
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:42.440]  and i don't mean physically fat i mean your soul is slovenly
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.000]  they're all shocked to hear that the sins of their youth might keep them out of
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.400]  canada but what they don't know is that this is
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:52.920]  just the beginning soon other nations will be able to look into their past
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:56.920]  when you want to travel and it goes on see all the countries are doing it
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:03.400]  it's the new world order it's the new world order

[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:28.360]  you want to be downtrodden you want to be shoved around and told how to live
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:31.400]  and what to eat and when to go to work and what to do
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:34.840]  you're going to have it

[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:48.600]  and it's going to incrementally happen all right i'm out of control i'm just
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.440]  so mad about this i've got a whole stack of police state news 10 times worse than
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:57.000]  what i just covered micah chicago you're on the air
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.320]  alec so are you i'm getting fired up yeah i can tell brother
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.560]  hey i was watching the bbc news last night i don't really watch tv ever but
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.040]  uh... they had mentioned that the refueling tankers are on their way to
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:13.800]  southwest asia we don't know what yeah they've got the
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.040]  entire battle fleet of arranging itself and others all this war propaganda of
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.880]  what they found and we moved six or seven carrier groups into the region over
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:25.720]  the last month and a half or so and it was just in passing it was just kind of
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:29.800]  like a side note uh... just said matter of factly
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:33.880]  and now we're moving to the uh... air tankers and and you don't do that unless
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:37.560]  you're going to bomb them and then they simultaneously say they may strike them
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.840]  but then when we say we're against it they come out and go it's a conspiracy
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:45.240]  look at these crazy people what i believe there's a north american union
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:49.320]  they believe there's a plan to attack iran they believe the government might
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:53.400]  not be telling the truth because the problem we have in this country is our
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.520]  fourth estate we get in a colesmith for two and a half
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:00.920]  weeks and that's it that's what people are basing their view of reality on that
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:04.920]  in jesus's tomb some some stopped by james cameron
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:07.560]  you know well that's part of breaking down society
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:11.160]  but people are forming their viewpoints oh that's total rosa crucian
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:14.200]  he was married to mary magdalene it's just their same agenda
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:17.800]  i know i know but it's the fourth estate that's keeping people in the dark so
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:22.120]  when you actually tell them things it sounds so far out left field how could
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:25.720]  it possibly be like this because no one's been paying attention anything for
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.000]  two or three generations oh yeah the general public knows nothing
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.640]  they don't even know where their state capital is they don't know the three
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:34.840]  branches of government they talk to people they know nothing
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:38.520]  no nothing nothing but they'll argue with you
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:41.800]  oh and and they do it all the time and the constitution the huge one argue
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.200]  with people over because they don't know anything about it
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:47.240]  you ask them to name three of the first ten amendments of the
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:50.760]  the constitution they couldn't tell you and if they can name one they can't
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:54.680]  tell you what it protects they have no clue they have no clue how this place

[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:36.280]  hi thank you for taking my call thanks for holding
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:40.040]  um there's a couple of things i actually wanted to talk about um first of all i
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.520]  had a couple of uh personal experiences with
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:49.720]  uh the increase in the police in the area um first of all my boyfriend was
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:55.560]  actually um beaten by seven police officers one of them was a swat
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:58.600]  officer yeah enforcement in new york is over five
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:02.680]  fold in the last two years on average it's up double nationwide they'll say
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:06.520]  good we're doing our job it's good we've gone from one million in prison
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:10.520]  to seven million in the system no folks this is about getting everybody into
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:13.640]  the system the criminals run the system go ahead
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:18.360]  um well basically he took a medication that was a prescription medication
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:21.560]  because he was unable to sleep for a few days
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:26.600]  and the police officers um for some reason assumed that he was on illegal
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:32.120]  narcotics and proceeded to practically beat him
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:35.400]  to death um he wasn't he didn't have any severe head
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:39.080]  trauma he actually tried to fight back and one of the swat
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:44.280]  officers um barely hurt his arm and so they had him hog
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:48.600]  tied on the ground um they continued to kick him in the head
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:51.960]  with steel-toed boots and beat him with uh
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:55.480]  their batons and now they're charging him with a salting god
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:02.120]  um well the officer tried to get him in trouble even though he was on a
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:06.360]  medication and they found that he was legally insane at the time because of
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:10.760]  the medication and the officer went ahead with the
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:14.760]  the charges even though the d a m the judge wanted to drop them
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:18.760]  well they always tell you that yeah so my boy wants somebody to be in a prison
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:23.080]  owned by the drug cartels by the drug dealers displacing everybody else by
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:27.160]  working for 20 cents in the dollar look it's just modern slavery again
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:31.240]  and i'm not saying society is unraveling and cops don't have a tough job either
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:34.600]  but this is going to get worse and worse we're a godless
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:41.560]  scumbag country so that's what's going to happen anything else
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:45.160]  um other than that i had a couple questions um i was wondering
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:51.480]  if you were aware of what ron paul's uh status was on medical cannabis and
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:54.920]  whether or not ron paul is for drug drug decriminalization
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:58.840]  okay and i also wanted to mention that the asa which is
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:04.040]  uh americans for safe access is filing a lawsuit against the federal
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:07.480]  government for claiming that medical marijuana has no
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:11.560]  medicinal value now i saw that report thank you so much for the call let's jam
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:15.960]  in one more here let's talk to shirley and washington go ahead
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:19.880]  hi alex two real brief things two or three
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:25.160]  uh chuck bald one pastor chuck bald one put out an article a couple hours ago
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.400]  so i sent it to your producer but now we've got it it's about why aren't the
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.120]  of evangelical supporting ron paul okay
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:36.120]  okay good and the other thing was that you frequently state that
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:40.680]  accountability by the global elite and other criminals will be before god
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:44.440]  and i question today with this phenomenal prison planet
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:50.360]  dot com expose if the reality has occurred to bbc executive
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:56.040]  mr guy smith and if he now wants to change his idea about who's a dropout
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:59.960]  well what will happen is they'll just spend it and claim something i mean he
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:03.000]  won't matter what they will be a lie whatever they claim but they count the

[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:39.880]  tv room which they never done before or since
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:43.320]  before it happened they were all told we've had these calls and i've talked
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:47.080]  to folks this has happened to that's another story we've got to track down
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:51.000]  get all their names have them on record as witnesses about this
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.960]  in some cases they weren't called in after the first hit
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:57.400]  but again they already had orders to call them in within minutes of it being
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:00.120]  hit so that was already set up in some cases they were told to get in the
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:04.040]  the auditoriums and in their barracks to watch tv before it happened
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:07.560]  then they turn the tv on and the plane has hit and then the whole thing was
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:11.000]  laid out and they said see what we've got to do now we've been attacked
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.960]  that's not saying that the officers who were told this were part of it they're
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:17.400]  just told get everybody in to watch tv and they think we're so dumb we'll just
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:20.040]  accept it it's like they told the firemen and police we're going to blow up
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:23.480]  building seven get ready they blew it up and later
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:26.520]  said no the fires did it and people go but you said you blew it up
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:29.800]  well let's just move on and the average american still doesn't even know what
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:33.560]  building seven was but let's go back to Shirley
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:36.440]  Shirley talk about what you witnessed or what you're talking about with the
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:39.880]  churches okay well i had you know i'd gotten all the live
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:44.360]  feed on the net and then i went to this church the sanctuary is open there's a
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:49.720]  huge screen descended from the altar with the words on a day which will live
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:53.000]  in infamy infamy and the time that a prayer
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.440]  vigil would be held i go back to the prayer vigil and the
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:00.280]  senior pastor is up there and i later found out they have an
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:03.880]  underground bunker in this church which the public is of which the public is
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:08.120]  now we learned even before 9-11 female was this is now mainstream news
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:12.280]  secretly recruiting uh recruiting preachers in 13,000 counties
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:16.920]  yeah yeah paul and steven you did an article on that many months ago
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.480]  anyway uh what the pastor wanted to do was screen troublemakers
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:24.200]  he wanted everybody i went back to the vigil
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.280]  his first trigger words were rosa velts addressed to congress on december 8th
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:33.320]  41 parts of that and the pearl harbor and then he wanted people to pray
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:37.000]  aloud and he was most definitely screening for
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.800]  for patriots
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:44.440]  oh the FEMA admits and we got their documents that they do script
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:48.120]  and that they're watching out for dissenters and thousands and thousands
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:51.880]  of pastors in every county in the country have been recruited for this and
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:55.240]  they're to tell their people to go to FEMA camps to turn their guns in to
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:58.360]  submit and they will do it they will break up
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:00.760]  families they will say bye bye to small children
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:04.360]  americans will submit and worship their government
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:08.920]  did you interview last year a pastor that came forward and admitted he was a
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:11.720]  FEMA yes jenesis broke that and then we got the
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:15.640]  documents and then they called him in and yelled at him and now he's scared but
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:19.400]  it later came out in the news and then was public
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:23.400]  good for you well i am so proud of you guys with today's
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:27.080]  um you know i don't know how bbc is going to account for this
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:31.800]  it would all of a sudden when that uh when that woman broke up on the screen
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:36.920]  you know it was like in a movie where you have a continuity person
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:42.440]  to make sure when you do a reshoot that the background stays the same
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:46.200]  uh they're going to have to start getting continuity before they
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:50.280]  they do their prescript i guess absolutely thanks for the call for
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:53.880]  those that don't know it's a huge story that broke
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:58.840]  major on prisonplanet.com yesterday the videos have been jerked over and over
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:03.240]  again by youtube google you name it it was up during the last break i went and
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:06.360]  checked it we keep finding the new links and
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:10.360]  linking to those they keep pulling it for content reasons
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:14.680]  they do not want you to hear this information
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:18.600]  the fiasco of the bbc journalist reporting in advance at building seven
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:21.960]  and collapsed as it loomed large behind her strikes at the very root
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:25.080]  of how the media were complicit in the actions
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:30.440]  and as facilitators for the official myth that was manufactured on 9-11
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:33.560]  after this debacle how can we trust anything we were told
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:37.880]  about september 11th from the mainstream media
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:42.200]  though the media the video was almost immediately purged by the crown kings of
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:45.560]  censorship google it has since been re-uploaded to youtube
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:49.000]  and feverishly copied elsewhere watch the clip below for an
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.040]  extended clip where the building seven farce is clearly
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:58.440]  anointed click here and skip forward to 14 minutes to the key area
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:02.680]  a key section the central facet of the debate raging against 9-11
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:07.640]  truthers and charged leveled by moronic debunkers as there is no time code
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:11.800]  on the clock or the video so how can we verify the bbc reported building seven
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:15.800]  collapsed 20 minutes before it fell does it matter
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:19.400]  does it matter if the bbc reported that collapsed
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:22.840]  23 minutes before it happened or 30 seconds before it happened
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:25.800]  the fact remains the building is there in the background
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:30.120]  behind the reporter's head as she is telling us that it is already collapsed
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:33.800]  don't get tangled up in the minutia the building is still
[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:38.280]  standing for 20 minutes while they talk about it how it's falling
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:42.040]  with her with her in new york bbc reported with it behind her
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:47.240]  she has reported its collapse its collapse debates about time stamps and
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:53.880]  time zones aren't relevant they are irrelevant
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:58.120]  this is amazing others charged at building seven was expected to collapse
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:01.720]  before it did which is true and the bbc merely jumped the gun
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:05.000]  but that begs the question how do the officials know the building was going
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.240]  to collapse with no modern steel building in history
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:11.720]  had it collapsed from fire alone and why were the bbc reporting its collapse
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:14.760]  in advance with the added knowledge of why it collapsed
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:17.720]  a question that is still being investigated by nist
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:20.520]  five and a half years later the government won't say why it fell
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:24.360]  whoever the bbc source was for reporting the collapse of building seven
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:27.800]  were ahead of nist by five and a half years
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:31.480]  and have already determined why the building collapsed before it had collapsed
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:35.880]  is that not at least a bit suspicious now
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:39.000]  then others say okay they really did have bombs in there but they planted them
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:44.520]  that day they planted bombs in the intel building
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:48.280]  for over a month before and tried to blow it up sunday here in austin and they
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:52.120]  couldn't even blow it up it failed just type in austin intel
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:55.880]  demolition the photos and video it'll pop up we should do an article about it
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:59.640]  and integrate it with this but that's how these double thinkers work first they
[02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:02.920]  claim the video is fake then they go to the bbc website and find out it's there
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:07.000]  in their archives at archive.org it clearly shows that almost 30 minutes
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.040]  before they start talking about how it's collapsed
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:13.960]  then six seven minutes later they cut to the later year about to hear
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:17.640]  and she keeps talking about the solemn building has collapsed now
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:21.880]  then they say the solemn building isn't seven that's its official name
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:25.720]  each building had a name but then they were designated one two three four five
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:28.680]  six and seven we have a link to the new york skyscraper
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:32.200]  web page and it shows it as solemn brothers building seven
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:36.440]  but you can look at it it's building seven this is the willful denial
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:40.440]  we deal with let's play the first clip right now
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:43.960]  where they're about to introduce her and then we skip forward about six seven
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:46.600]  minutes when we go to the lady on the ground here it is
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:49.880]  we'll leave it there for the moment we've got some news just coming in
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:55.400]  actually that the solemn brothers building in new york right in the
[02:16:55.400 --> 02:17:01.640]  the heart of manhattan has also collapsed this does fit in with a warning
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:06.120]  from the british foreign office a couple of hours ago to british citizens
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:11.880]  that there is a real risk let me get the exact words that the british foreign
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:14.280]  office the foreign department of the british government said
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:19.240]  there was a strong risk of further atrocities in the united states
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.960]  and it does seem as if there now is another one with the solemn brothers
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:27.240]  building collapsing we've got no word yet on
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:31.240]  casualties one assumes that the the boat would have been
[02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:35.320]  virtually now let's go to the next clip seven minutes later from the live feed
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:39.640]  at archive dot org and bbc's own archive directly off there
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:45.000]  let's now go to the next part where they cut to her on the ground here it is
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.240]  now more on the latest building collapse in new york you might have heard a few
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:53.240]  moments ago was talking about the solemn brothers building collapsing
[02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:57.240]  and indeed it has apparently that's only a few hundred yards away from where the
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:01.640]  world trade center towers were and it seems that this was not a result of a
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:05.720]  new attack it was because the building had been weakened
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:09.080]  during this morning's attacks we'll probably find out more now about that
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:13.640]  from our correspondent jane stanley jane what more can you tell us about the
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:17.320]  solemn brothers building and its collapse
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:21.400]  well only really what you already know details are very very sketchy there's
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:26.520]  almost a sense down town in new york behind me down by the world trade
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:30.440]  centers of just an area completely closed off as the rescue
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:35.480]  workers try to do their job but this isn't the first building that
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:39.720]  has suffered as a result we know that part of the marriott hotel
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:43.640]  next to the world trade center also collapsed as a result of this
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:49.720]  huge amount of falling debris from 110 floors of two the two twin towers of
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:52.920]  the world trade center as you can see behind me
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:57.400]  the trade center appears to be still burning we see these huge
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:01.560]  clouds of smoke and ash and we know that behind that there's
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:05.160]  an empty piece of what was a very familiar
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:09.400]  new york skyline a symbol of the financial prosperity
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:16.040]  of this city all right completely so so there you have it
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:19.160]  and
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:22.280]  they're saying building seven the solemn brothers building has collapsed and
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:26.440]  they zoom in over her shoulder she steps aside and there it is standing
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:29.400]  then all the sudden she goes on for about eight more minutes and then the
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:33.320]  satellite feed cuts out and they go oh then they cut back later oh look
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:36.520]  you see you collapse boom and then notice the
[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:40.280]  key smoking gun here is that they've all
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:45.000]  ready reported that oh it fell because it was weakened
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:48.840]  they've already got the official story it fell because it was weakened
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:52.040]  and it hasn't even fallen now when we come back
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:56.840]  we're going to play a clip on the bird flu
[02:19:57.640 --> 02:20:01.480]  this is in austin this is a reported university of texas they're doing this
[02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:04.840]  at austin and at their research facility down in gallistan
[02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:08.600]  where they're splicing human flu with bird flu but it's all a big accident no
[02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:10.920]  big deal then we'll go to break come back play
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:13.960]  ludobs from last night again with ron paul
[02:20:13.960 --> 02:20:17.480]  and then we're going to come back after that and i'll analyze both the bird flu
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:23.160]  and this new piece from cnn so those are straight ahead and i'll be back about
[02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:29.080]  40 after after these next two clips so be sure and stay with us
[02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:35.720]  the war on terrorism will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at

[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:50.360]  you two goddess of bullet in the form of a hybrid flu driver city of everyone
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:53.400]  i'm lorianna indus and i'm mike warren there was an accident the
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:58.280]  university's most secure lab involving part of a strain of bird flu
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:01.320]  from that some serious questions have come to light
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:06.200]  and accusations of a cover-up and threats to public safety
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:11.080]  inside the moffat molecular biology building is ut's level three biosafety
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:15.640]  lab the university admits that last april a researcher in full
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:19.000]  protective gear put a test tube containing a hybrid
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:24.200]  virus of human flu and parts of bird flu into a centrifuge the researcher was
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:27.160]  working with a centrifuge similar to something like this
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:31.080]  and he had a test tube inside this area here and what we're told happened
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:35.160]  is that this part is what actually came loose and broke
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:38.280]  what did that researcher do after that he basically
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:42.200]  waited some waited a period of time then began decon procedures for both the
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:45.720]  centrifuge the room and then himself before he left the laboratory
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:49.880]  part of those decontamination procedures included wiping down the centrifuge
[02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:54.200]  with lysol so did a hybrid flu escape into the lab
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:57.480]  was the researcher infected he was given tamiflu
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:01.800]  as a precaution and the university says there was no contamination beyond the
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:05.320]  lab which has safety measures for such a release
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:09.000]  the university filed a report with the travis county health department but a
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:12.600]  biosafety watchdog group called the sunshine project
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:17.240]  isn't so sure about what really happened the university tried to cover up
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:21.240]  and tried to prevent release of additional information about the accident
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:24.360]  and we had to fight through a process with the attorney general
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:28.600]  in order to get documentation of it the initial report refers to one kind of
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:32.760]  virus that was being worked on in the lab and then after that report came out
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:36.200]  they they told reporters that it was in fact a different
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:39.880]  virus that was being worked in the lab and the inconsistencies in the
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:44.440]  university's story really bother us they're also bothered about just how
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:48.280]  dangerous that hybrid virus was this particular
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:54.040]  cross of these two kinds of flues is exactly what many scientists fear
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:59.000]  could happen in nature and could result in the next strain that's pandemic for
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.640]  human beings it had gotten out of the lab
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:05.400]  the likelihood of it being an issue for the general population we very love
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:10.360]  the university says the hybrid flu was mostly the regular human flu we all
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:13.880]  can get and added to it was one non disease
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:17.000]  causing gene from the bird flu but no matter the
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:20.120]  disagreement between the sunshine project in the university
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.000]  these issues bring out the fact that on this campus
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:27.320]  researchers in the past and present have worked with parts of dangerous and
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:31.480]  deadly viruses things like bird flu and anthrax
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:35.800]  i think they have it pretty much under control because they wouldn't make it
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:40.280]  unsafe for us to be in the same building in there
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:43.560]  to do that kind of research if it wasn't safe
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:46.680]  i was totally not cognizant of something like that was happening but i
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:51.480]  should expect something of that gravity at a university like this so
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:55.560]  i'm not shocked but no i wasn't aware of it
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:59.480]  you would think they would have it under control you know if i mean it's a big
[02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:03.240]  university they should have stuff under control as for the incident with the
[02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:06.120]  centrifuge the university maintained there was no
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:10.760]  contamination the researcher is fine the incident is over with
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:14.760]  and ut meets its research responsibilities for as long as the
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:18.360]  procedures are in place and are followed correctly i think there's
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:22.120]  there's no reason why it couldn't be worked with but this is not over for the
[02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:25.640]  watchdog group the sunshine project their concerns remain
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:29.080]  they are still requesting documents from the university regarding the
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:32.120]  incident ut also tells fox seven that following
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:37.000]  last year's incident protocol for using the centrifuge in the lab has changed
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:40.920]  administrators hope this will prevent another accident like this from happening
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:29:04.840]  again
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:11.000]  wake up boys there's a light at the window
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.280]  i can hear someone knocking on the door
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:21.560]  there are voices in the street and the sound of running feet
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:26.680]  and they whisper the word
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:32.600]  there are men coming down from the valleys
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:38.280]  there are tall ships flying off the coast
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:43.960]  and they carry the light in the dark of the night
[02:29:43.960 --> 02:29:49.640]  like a whisper in the wind
[02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:55.560]  bring my gun and a hand for the silver
[02:29:55.560 --> 02:30:01.400]  by the sea we will gather for the fight
[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:08.680]  it's been so many years so many tears we have lost
[02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:15.880]  once before now we'll sell the score when our cannons will roar
[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:19.960]  rather than die
[02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:23.800]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:28.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:34.200]  people who use cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out
[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:37.800]  for over five years cardivite has proven itself time tested
[02:30:37.800 --> 02:30:41.480]  here's dr mattson a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on cardivite
[02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:45.560]  in our mind there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore this basic
[02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:48.600]  tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least seven to
[02:30:48.600 --> 02:30:51.640]  eighty percent of the disease that we see when we do our program you know
[02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:55.320]  herple form is like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:59.320]  hill now going for regular job a few months later we know we're doing
[02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:03.160]  something right it's a well thought out formula i mean the idea of it working
[02:31:03.160 --> 02:31:07.160]  on the east end metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on
[02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:10.920]  if you'll find i think that it'll work more than just on on heart problems and
[02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:13.800]  circulation problems it'll work on other problems as well for more

[02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:33.160]  it's a fact you can legally eliminate credit card debt which has been
[02:31:33.160 --> 02:31:37.880]  fraudulently created by the banks since its creation in 1913 the federal
[02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:40.760]  reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt
[02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:44.200]  so why should you the hardworking american be harassed for yours
[02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:47.400]  there's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt and
[02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:50.920]  unlike the federal reserve the people of this country can't print more money
[02:31:50.920 --> 02:31:54.120]  when needed day of jubilee has created a successful

[02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:09.880]  have legally eliminated their credit card debt instead of living each day in

[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:35.320]  the field for candidates for the 2008 presidential race continues to grow
[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:38.840]  now this past weekend republican congressman ron paul of texas
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:42.440]  announced that he is forming a presidential exploratory committee
[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:46.680]  and congressman paul hopes his strong opposition to illegal immigration
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:50.920]  and the war in iraq will set him apart from other republican candidates
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:54.600]  and he joins us now from houston texas thanks for taking the time sir
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:57.880]  thank you it's nice to be with you you know you're one of only six republicans
[02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:02.040]  who voted against the war you're also stood against sending 21
[02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:06.600]  thousand more troops to iraq what should the iraq strategy be and now that
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.000]  you are declaring yourself in the race
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.720]  i think we should come home as quickly as possible
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:15.400]  there were a lot of a lot of false information on the reasons we went in
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:18.040]  there and there's no good reason to stay
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.960]  right now they say that if the main reason for staying now after given
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:25.400]  numerous reasons we're supposed to stay now because if we leave there'll be
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:28.520]  chaos my argument is there's plenty of chaos right
[02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:31.560]  there now and a lot of americans are going to be being killed
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:35.000]  and it was never in our national security interest to go over there
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:39.560]  besides one of the reasons that was given for us going there was to enforce
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:43.080]  un resolutions and i'm a stickler for the constitution
[02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:45.880]  i was annoyed because they wouldn't declare war they thought it was
[02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:49.640]  important to go to war the people's representatives should declare war and
[02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:52.520]  they should fight it and get over with and win so
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:55.320]  i didn't like the way they went and i didn't think we were ever threatened
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:58.200]  by iraq let me uh... let me just play for you
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:03.400]  uh... president bush said something today so let's listen to that for a second
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:08.280]  if we leave before that country can govern itself and sustain itself and
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:11.800]  defend itself there will be chaos and out of chaos will come
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:15.960]  vacuums and out of vacuums will become an emboldened enemy
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:20.440]  they would like to do is harm that is a real worry
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:24.200]  what have you to say about that well i think he's very sincere and he believes
[02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:26.440]  it but he believes it just as sincerely
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:30.520]  as i do that the al-qaeda uh... is there now
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:33.480]  and it is a problem but they weren't there before
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:37.640]  and it's our foreign policy that i object to we used to be allies with osama
[02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:41.160]  bin laden now he's our enemy we used to be allies with saddam
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:44.920]  hussein now he's our enemy this on again off again
[02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:48.680]  saying is what bothers me you know nine eleven was not
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:53.240]  uh... had nothing to do with the rack uh... fifteen of the nineteen came from
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:56.040]  saudi arabia so there are bosom buddies and we
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:35:59.560]  they're we're their best friends pakistan is probably where osama bin
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:02.280]  laden is we have essentially forgotten about him
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:07.080]  so it's the foreign policy over over all but yes there's going to be problems
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:11.800]  in chaos but my argument is that it's time that american soldiers quit being
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:14.200]  killed and it's time for us to quit killing
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:16.760]  a lot of other people that have not attacked us
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:21.320]  now your erect policies very clearly defined let's move to the domestic front
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:25.080]  um... you ran for president in nineteen eighty eight on the libertarian line
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:28.840]  and you now say there are two parties in congress right now big government
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:33.000]  conservatives and big government liberals and the only difference is what
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.640]  they want to spend money on now on are you running because you think that
[02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:40.520]  there are of the declared candidates uh...
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:43.560]  the true conservatives are not coming out of this pack
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:48.440]  well certainly the republican leadership in the last six eight even ten years
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:52.600]  uh... and especially these last six years we we have been the big party a
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:55.400]  big spender party we have spent more money
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:37:00.200]  on subsidies than ever before we have and we've doubled the size of the
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:04.120]  department of education we brought in one of the biggest new entitlement
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.120]  programs and uh... the prescription drug programs
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:14.120]  big huge highway expenditures so i would say uh... that in some ways yes they
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:18.120]  have some differences but in other ways i think republicans have grown to
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:22.680]  act just like democrats in the foreign policy certainly we can't afford
[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:26.440]  seven hundred billion dollars in protecting an empire that has to come
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:29.720]  into an end because the truth is is we're flat out broke and we have to
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:33.560]  borrow every single penny to fight that war from the chinese yeah
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:36.760]  you know sir i really can't we're almost out of time but i want to get to your
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:41.160]  immigration uh... platform uh... you're calling for action and not talk and
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:44.280]  here's a couple of points for our viewers that you want you want to
[02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:47.000]  physically secure our borders and coastlines and force
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:53.240]  enforce visa rules no amnesty uh... no welfare for illegal aliens you want to
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:58.040]  end the birthright citizenship and pass true immigration reform
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:02.520]  um... would true immigration reform include a guest worker program in your
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:06.600]  judgment well you know you those words are tricky because sometimes if you say
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:08.760]  for a guest worker program all of a sudden they
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:12.360]  construed that now the conventional wisdom is that there will be and the
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:15.800]  state now we've always had workers come to this country but they have to be
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:19.560]  legal and we have to deal with the welfare state we can't allow the
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:23.960]  illegal immigrants to qualify for social security after working here for 18
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:27.080]  months we we just flat out can afford it
[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:30.120]  all right thank you very much for laying it out so clearly for us
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:35.160]  representative ron paul thank you thank you
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:39.800]  good evening i would like to report on the state of our war against the american
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:42.360]  people
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:46.760]  we're mounting a sustained campaign to crack down on
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:51.320]  every american and every person of every faith
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:57.240]  every nation and to bring them to justice
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:00.280]  all missions are being executed according to plan
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:05.400]  without warning of publication Americans are being swept up in an
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:10.040]  international drag net thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:14.040]  other citizens here in abroad it has everything to do with hate and
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:17.720]  evil and murder and prejudice america strong

[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:06.440]  i see a message from the government like every day i'll watch it and listen
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:10.440]  and call them all suckers they wanted me about a summer or whatever

[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:36.920]  and you know what if you saw all the things that's wrong

[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:49.720]  well you were sleeping
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:55.720]  they came and took it all away
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:44:01.240]  the names and all right that syndicated radio program national women's show
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:04.760]  with ralonda watts held me a few minutes longer
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:09.400]  this is my life i did eight hours of radio and tv yesterday i'm not whining
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:12.120]  about it it just gets more and more insane
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:16.920]  in our complete and total dedication against fighting the new world order
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:23.240]  did you hear that earlier clip where oh they're accidentally splicing the human
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:25.800]  flu with the bird flu and oh the government's
[02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:28.520]  accidentally mailed out thousands of samples around the country and other
[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:31.240]  reports and oh we're doing level four bio weapons
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:37.080]  experiments at ut austin and ut uh galveston in level two
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:41.480]  facilities but it's no big deal and they wouldn't do anything it wasn't safe
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:46.440]  for the students the government's nice i mean they're telling you al-qaeda is
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:49.960]  going to kill you any minute they've got nukes and bio weapons totally made up
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:53.560]  meanwhile they've got 36 level four bio weapons labs
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:57.400]  most of them operating in level two or three these things should be underground
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:00.680]  and sealed bunkers that are ready to incinerate themselves that's what real
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:04.600]  level four does surrounded by minefields and machine gun nest
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:09.240]  oh no they're just in the facilities with glass windows and little containment
[02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:12.440]  rooms and the students go in and they mailed deadly superfluor
[02:45:12.440 --> 02:45:16.680]  around what was it two years ago five thousand doses of it all around and
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:20.040]  testing kits to random facilities people breathing it
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:23.720]  when they open it up to quote test against local flues they're seeing
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:27.560]  again and then that's their plausible deniability if they ever launch a real
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:34.760]  superfluor something along those lines i cannot stress to you
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:39.160]  the importance of the bbc saying building seven had fallen 20 plus minutes
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:43.400]  before it fell and in the video of it not falling as she sits there and goes on
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:46.760]  script it's not just one reporter it's the bbc in
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:52.920]  london the bbc in new york on 9 11 and we just got to get this story out to
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:55.880]  absolutely everybody i know i've been gone for a while
[02:45:55.880 --> 02:45:59.640]  here who do we go to next coal wise
[02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:05.320]  james and maryland thanks for holding hello yes sir yes i was wondering if you
[02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:10.200]  had heard uh... i think last week when pat robertson said that he got a word
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:13.000]  from the lord that will be attacked in 2007
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:17.000]  the 33rd degree basins just more fair mongering
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:20.760]  and i was wondering if you could clarify something for me alex is it
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:24.120]  propaganda the reports that i've been hearing that my mood
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:29.560]  i'm a denny jott had said uh... some 12th emom or some such was supposed to be
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:33.800]  on march 21st or if you heard that or a few months ago they were saying that
[02:46:33.800 --> 02:46:37.240]  emom was going to come kill us and it was the end of the world it's all made up
[02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:40.520]  they claim they make jews wear yellow stars total lie
[02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:43.640]  that they just lie about everything this is pre-war propaganda
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:47.240]  there's like babies out of incubators just like wmd is an iraq
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:51.000]  same thing that's amazing so he that's completely fabricated
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:56.200]  yes okay thank you or if that's fabricated but so many other things are
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:46:58.840]  twisted like he quotes the italy commanding and i'm not saying these
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:00.200]  are good people
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:04.120]  uh... but we're but saying it design a state needs to be wiped from the pages
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:06.440]  of history needs to be removed
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:10.040]  and then it turns into israel needs to be blown off the map with newt's
[02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:14.200]  didn't say it but you got a public that can find i ran on the map and they're
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:16.680]  brown and they need to die
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:21.000]  uh... let's go to robert the san diego you're on the air go ahead hi alex this is a
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.400]  of the rtb student i got uh...
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.000]  we ran out of time before we got the big payoff on that audio clip
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:30.680]  about the uh... retarded patsy hijacking the plane of you call them a long
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:34.120]  audio clip that we couldn't understand the audio wasn't good
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:37.720]  oh why don't you just verbally tell us about it sir okay
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:41.720]  msnbc is reporting the liquid bomber they're taking everybody's liquids from
[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:45.080]  the airport and bomb makers bomb experts say there's no way
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:48.200]  in five hours you could do that in the restroom if you were left alone
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:51.080]  you gotta make it and try it but it doesn't even work that well
[02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:53.720]  so they break in and say al jazeera is tracking
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:56.760]  this hijacked plane and they go to their uh... for an interpreter
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:57.560]  and it's all
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:00.520]  they're going on a script right so they don't know what the interpreter is going
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:02.200]  to say he turns out and says
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:05.640]  yes this twenty-year-old black man but the eyewitness sitting next to him said
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:07.240]  he was totally retarded
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:10.280]  and there was no way that he could have hijacked the plane but they arrested him
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:13.320]  anyway no look look every week they bust somebody
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:16.680]  who argues with the sturdice and it's al qaeda tried to hit we stopped him and
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:20.520]  then two days later footnote retraction it was a mentally ill person
[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:24.040]  had a seizure the thing is is they try to stay on script after they announced
[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:27.160]  the guy's retarded and they say well this just goes to prove al qaeda is
[02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:30.600]  trying to keep hijacking planes but with another victory for the
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:34.280]  you know anti-terror threat and it is just so perfect i'm gonna say that's the
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:37.480]  thing they were announcing on building seven on nine eleven it's gonna come
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:40.040]  down we're gonna blow it up we're gonna bring it down
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:42.840]  like somebody screwed up and let the truth out because they're they're trying to
[02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:46.200]  tell the cops in fireman this so they go along so they start announcing it they
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:49.880]  go no no no no no building hit it building hit it and then before it even
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:55.240]  falls bbc's announcing it fell because the tower fell on it and once you wake
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:48:59.160]  up to this this pattern you start to see this propaganda placement all over the
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:02.200]  place look look it's simple most your local newscast are
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:05.960]  are the three major networks get all their major feeds
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:10.280]  out of cbs broadcast center in manhattan this was set up
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:18.440]  with a back in 2000 and it's fox cbs and nbc abc isn't part of it
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:24.920]  and that's why like five years ago they go on cbs k i and austin and they say
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:28.600]  they say openly mercury is now good for your brain
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:32.680]  federal studies show that it actually helps your your brain development for
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:35.960]  children to have mercury in them and i went
[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:39.320]  you know what i know that was written at cbs broadcast center
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:42.280]  if i type in that headline i'm going to find it
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:46.360]  on every cbs station in the country i typed it in guess what popped up
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:49.880]  hundreds of the same headline so all they do is they
[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:53.880]  t1 or at the time satellite the feeds in with the
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:58.440]  canned teleprompter text and the video and then your local news reader give it a
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:01.800]  local feel sits there and reads off the prompter
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:05.240]  while that national news feed they recorded plays
[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:08.840]  so then the only local reporting is a wreck or the football game or how
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:12.360]  gracious our leaders are so the people doing it don't even know
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:15.640]  how controlled they are some nationwide mercury is nutritious
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:20.520]  and it has the look of local okay this is what the these people are repeaters
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:24.360]  they just repeat you're exactly right from somebody who's in the industry i'm
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:27.000]  a news anchor you know it's out of the college thing but
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.120]  you could quickly find out that only takes a few gatekeepers
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:33.480]  to make sure only certain news gets out there it's really simple to understand
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:36.680]  and that's who goes to the top most these reporters aren't operatives
[02:50:36.680 --> 02:50:39.880]  they stay on script even when the buildings behind them hadn't fallen
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:43.480]  she keeps looking at it and turning going it's falling and she can tell she's
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:47.320]  freaked out but they just stay on script i mean reporters they don't have time
[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:50.680]  to match up with what they're reading on the teleprompter with reality
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:55.480]  they're paid to read the teleprompter and to have nice hair and to wear a
[02:50:55.480 --> 02:50:58.360]  three thousand dollar suit with a two hundred dollar tie
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:03.000]  and they have q scores they have q scores for facial expressions believability

[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:18.520]  federal reserve chairman ellen greenspan warned monday that the american
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:21.080]  economy might slip in recession by year's end
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:24.600]  he said the u.s economy had been expanding since 2001 and that there are
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:29.000]  signs that current economic cycle is coming to an end
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.880]  yeah and we've never been in greater debt or more set up for a fall but the
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:36.280]  very people that did it to us will give us the next solution
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:39.960]  that's government employment mass welfare when you get
[02:55:39.960 --> 02:55:44.040]  this far away from recession in variable forces build up from the next
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:47.560]  recession and indeed we're beginning to see the sign i thought we just left
[02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:50.920]  one green span said via satellite link to a business
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:54.760]  conference in hong kong for example in the u.s profit margins have begun to
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:58.680]  stabilize which is an early sign we're in the later stages of the
[02:55:58.680 --> 02:56:02.440]  cycle while yes it is possible we can get a recession in the later months of
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:05.880]  07 most forecasters are not making that judgment and indeed are projecting
[02:56:05.880 --> 02:56:11.400]  forward into 2008 with some slowdown he said
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:14.760]  the truth is we live in a total fiat economy like a heroin addict
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:18.040]  strung out on so much heroin they can't even get high off of it anymore they
[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:20.680]  just got to take more and more they get sick
