[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:24.240]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones same sad story
[00:24.240 --> 00:32.160]  different day the 26th day of January 2016 on this Tuesday global broadcast an active shooter
[00:32.160 --> 00:38.760]  reported at San Diego's Naval Medical Center that is close to the general public and is a
[00:38.760 --> 00:45.280]  gun-free zone like all US military bases they only have the local security police force or
[00:45.280 --> 00:50.680]  the MP force at these different facilities and many of them don't even have basic security at all
[00:50.680 --> 00:57.280]  but a couple police officers in squad cars the Naval Medical Center possible active shooter being
[00:57.280 --> 01:02.920]  reported by San Diego 7 that's what they were saying about 10 minutes ago now they're saying it
[01:02.920 --> 01:09.280]  is an active shooter we hope this is a false alarm but if it is an active shooter will it be
[01:09.280 --> 01:15.000]  another jihadi and if the name comes out to be a Middle Eastern or Arabic name will the media
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.280]  cover that up for a few days like they did to San Bernardino or like they did at Fort Hood for four
[01:21.280 --> 01:26.840]  years saying it wasn't a jihad attack even though he was directed by Al Qaeda and the government
[01:26.840 --> 01:34.680]  knew two years before what Major Hassan was planning incredible they bring these people in
[01:34.680 --> 01:41.480]  they attack and then when they attack we have to give up our rights I'm not saying this is an Islamic
[01:41.480 --> 01:46.760]  attack but the last few big shootings have been let's hope it's not an attack period but we are
[01:46.760 --> 01:53.960]  tracking it as it unfolds you can also go to their Facebook page of the Navy Medical Center and
[01:53.960 --> 01:58.840]  they say it is an active shooter me and big just did a live Facebook mentions on that we can have
[01:58.840 --> 02:05.560]  bigs come in the controller make a punch it up for you they say hide shelter in place run or fight
[02:05.560 --> 02:12.920]  which is unprecedented because it bases and government buildings and colleges they advise
[02:12.920 --> 02:20.120]  people to actually lay down and and act like you're dead or in a fetal position or if you're
[02:20.120 --> 02:27.400]  being raped urinate on someone or vomit on them look I'm not joking that's what they say I have
[02:27.400 --> 02:32.400]  an idea if there's an active shooter here I just pull a gun out and defend myself let's see I live
[02:32.400 --> 02:39.360]  in Texas so we're going to be following that as it unfolds ladies and gentlemen we can also punch
[02:39.360 --> 02:45.760]  up behind me and analyze it CNN's live feed from helicopters outside the base it is controlled
[02:45.760 --> 02:53.280]  airspace so they're flying around the edge of the base shooting footage into what is happening there
[02:53.280 --> 03:03.120]  here naval med center in San Diego reports active shooter and this is again just the ongoing thing
[03:03.120 --> 03:10.000]  like the shooter at the naval yard and in these gun-free zones where this happens and where we
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.560]  see this unfolding so info wars here covering what's happening in analyzing and documenting
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.720]  and tracking the controlled government finance CNN it's a lot of government financing and
[03:22.720 --> 03:27.200]  funding and support just like MSNBC funding what our taxpayer dollars are going to be saying
[03:27.920 --> 03:32.720]  about the second amendment and they're getting feeds there at CNN from the total traffic and
[03:32.720 --> 03:38.320]  weather network again we're a radio show but we're also a tv show so that we can document in
[03:38.320 --> 03:46.080]  live time for those that wish to add another layer of research and documentation to their daily
[03:46.080 --> 03:50.800]  analysis of world events as they unfold now when we come back we're going to kick off the big

[04:13.600 --> 04:18.960]  at false flag terror attacks there's different types of false flags there's wind-up toys there's
[04:18.960 --> 04:24.240]  provocateur events there's opening the door there's protecting terrorists or their synthetic terror
[04:24.240 --> 04:29.520]  where you completely manufacture the whole deal the media dumps down false flags and just says
[04:29.520 --> 04:36.400]  that we say nothing happened that no one died at sandy hook or there were no hijackers on 9-11 no
[04:36.400 --> 04:41.200]  we just simply look at who stands to gain who takes our liberties after the attacks and who
[04:41.200 --> 04:46.560]  ordered stand downs on 9-11 bare minimum criminal elements of the government order to stand down
[04:46.560 --> 04:51.520]  for Saudi Arabia and that's in the 28 pages and congressmen and senators are on record who've seen
[04:51.520 --> 04:57.200]  the class of a document so yes 9-11 is an inside job we win we're proven right we're validated

[11:42.720 --> 11:48.320]  pre-submitted questions simply incredible we have another story up at drudgereport.com
[11:49.440 --> 11:54.960]  where one of bill clinton's victims that that that clinton uh basically is targeted before
[11:54.960 --> 12:00.400]  is saying that she fears for her life and that if they say that she commits suicide that that
[12:00.400 --> 12:05.120]  that the clinton's have killed her so we're going to get to that as well and then i didn't know this
[12:05.120 --> 12:11.920]  happened last friday no one has covered it and then there it was at info wars.com adan salazar
[12:11.920 --> 12:18.640]  did a report on it last night no one else that i know of has covered this which is scary i wish
[12:18.640 --> 12:24.000]  others had it's not like oh good we broke it you know four days after it came out he's on the floor
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.400]  on c span and warns of total martial law in the legislation that i called martial law last friday
[12:30.400 --> 12:38.320]  that's what it does and it just got no attention now a us senator gets up and talks about declaration
[12:38.320 --> 12:43.840]  of international martial law which is a quote that's my quote because that's what it does
[12:43.840 --> 12:49.280]  just 360 war anytime congress signs over its authority ron paul says it makes the iraq war
[12:49.280 --> 12:55.360]  powers authorization the widest ever uh look like a walk in the park close quote so a lot of crazy
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.800]  stuff is happening uh right now but let's go to joe bigs who had who was in their monitoring the
[13:00.800 --> 13:07.600]  situation at the naval medical center in san diego california another victim disarmament zone
[13:07.600 --> 13:13.360]  just like the major hasan uh in ford hood not being called terrorism and the people not being able
[13:13.360 --> 13:18.320]  to be armed just like sanden bernadino not being called terrorism and the cover-up and of course
[13:18.320 --> 13:24.160]  people not being able to be armed we hope that this is uh no loss of life we don't know yet
[13:24.160 --> 13:30.000]  joe bigs give us the latest thank you alex now what we do know this this is a place for returning
[13:30.000 --> 13:38.160]  veterans it has a large ptsd clinic uh inside there and they're urging those inside to run hide or
[13:38.160 --> 13:43.760]  fight which is very unusual compared to what we've heard before a family member of one person inside
[13:43.760 --> 13:49.280]  said that they weren't even sure if it was a drill or really an active shooter scenario now there
[13:49.280 --> 13:55.520]  are reports of three shots fired near building 26 no reports of injuries at this time san diego
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.680]  schools have now been on lockdown that are near that facility and at this point in time there have
[13:59.680 --> 14:05.600]  been no sightings of a shooter all right again joe bigs is going to be tracking this in every 10
[14:05.600 --> 14:12.160]  15 minutes popping in or even sooner he'll just break in joe anytime there is a new development
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.280]  and just continue to update us along with the rest of the great crew but let me just ask you to
[14:17.280 --> 14:22.960]  speculate and again when we speculate we're not reporting this we're just speculating uh most of
[14:22.960 --> 14:31.600]  the latest uh mass shooting attacks have been jihadist related uh this may be ptsd it may be a drill
[14:31.600 --> 14:35.760]  a lot of times now they have drills and then scare people for a few hours before they admit it's a
[14:35.760 --> 14:41.200]  drill or they have a backfire outside the capital in a parking garage and evacuate it for five hours
[14:41.200 --> 14:47.520]  and create total hysteria it could be that as well uh statistically though i would say it's
[14:47.520 --> 14:52.320]  could be a jihad attack i'm not saying it is but that's the most common thing we're facing right
[14:52.320 --> 14:56.480]  now especially at government buildings and government facilities and these medical facilities
[14:56.480 --> 15:02.800]  aren't as well protected uh as obviously a combat readiness bases uh and are more easy to infiltrate
[15:02.800 --> 15:07.760]  joe bags yeah i totally agree i mean there's also some possibility it could be another nadal
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.800]  hassan another guy that's been inside the military who's just kind of been waiting quietly and then
[15:12.800 --> 15:18.160]  all the sudden decides to uh basically be activated and do something or it could be a legitimate case
[15:18.160 --> 15:23.840]  of psd a ptsd a regular soldier coming back and uh something happened to dispute between himself
[15:23.840 --> 15:29.360]  and someone else or we could have another sandburn adino so we'll be sitting here bringing updates as
[15:29.360 --> 15:35.200]  they happen here at the info war studio all right joe bags thank you so much uh now folks
[15:35.200 --> 15:40.640]  continuing getting back to the news uh we're going to play a video have we pulled in the video yet
[15:40.640 --> 15:44.000]  because i forgot to tell you guys till right before showtime i was running around like a
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.840]  chicken with my head cut off when the mass shooting news came in five minutes before showtime
[15:47.840 --> 15:54.080]  senator are not mass shooting active shooting that we hope isn't a mass shooting video senator warns
[15:55.040 --> 16:03.200]  that the military authorization use of force bill is a declaration of international martial law
[16:03.200 --> 16:08.720]  close quote the resolution is a total rewrite of the war powers clause of the constitution close
[16:08.720 --> 16:15.600]  code do we have that yet good we're going to be getting to that uh here in just a few minutes
[16:15.600 --> 16:23.040]  that is a big big deal because it's not just alex jones saying it last friday or ron paul
[16:23.040 --> 16:28.720]  saying it yesterday in his in his article he wrote about it uh now it's a u.s senator
[16:28.720 --> 16:35.840]  or warning people that this is an unprecedented transference of power i mean you read the resolution
[16:35.840 --> 16:39.520]  they've been trying to sneak through and ram through and even senator john cornyn who's the
[16:40.080 --> 16:45.200]  whip in the senate uh you know under the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said i didn't
[16:45.200 --> 16:50.320]  know about this are you kidding when a reporter asked him about it on friday there it is congress
[16:50.320 --> 16:55.520]  is writing the president a blank check for war the legislation makes the unconstitutional
[16:55.520 --> 17:03.600]  iraq war authorization of 2002 look like a walk in the park when we come back from break we are
[17:03.600 --> 17:09.600]  going to play the video from the article that went up on info wars dot com last night i'm

[24:13.600 --> 24:24.000]  medical center and we said earlier will there be a bunch of drills before this will this be a drill
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.040]  coinciding with it because so many times they announce a real shooting and later we learned
[24:27.040 --> 24:30.720]  it's a drill but it has the same effect of people thinking mass shootings are up
[24:32.720 --> 24:36.560]  we are confirming his military id right now we're not going to show that on air but we don't
[24:36.560 --> 24:40.960]  just do what mainstream news does they just open the phones up we've confirmed he's in san diego
[24:40.960 --> 24:46.320]  but we are confirming he's going to send us his military id as we speak
[24:48.640 --> 24:54.000]  and he's on standby on the phone right now he got through via email to our news director rob
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.400]  dude and as soon as we confirm his identity not for public display but but to add more
[25:00.400 --> 25:05.040]  credibility we're going to have him on air active shooter at naval medical center in san diego
[25:05.040 --> 25:11.600]  i am active duty navy e6 stationed at nbsd next door basically we recently had loads of active
[25:11.600 --> 25:17.520]  shooter drills and now the real call me for anything you need and so do's been talking to
[25:17.520 --> 25:23.520]  him so is nico and they have last week drills at the naval base drills at the medical center
[25:24.960 --> 25:30.160]  of an active shooter just like they kept having drill after drill after drill every month at
[25:30.160 --> 25:36.640]  san bernadino and then you have these people with bombs and all the rest of it they won't call them
[25:36.640 --> 25:43.360]  jihadis are they running the drill so that they can then control the situation with a hopped up
[25:43.360 --> 25:48.560]  wind up toy uh you know somebody that they're directing in to do this i mean look we know they
[25:48.560 --> 25:54.160]  run false flags david steel robert david steels coming on who who ran field operations with the
[25:54.160 --> 26:00.000]  cia in the middle east he was a former marine and then they hired him to run operations
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.840]  in the field all over the middle east and he ran false flags against our enemies to make them look
[26:05.840 --> 26:14.880]  bad now he didn't kill people but bobby kennedy it was declassified a decade ago even on front
[26:14.880 --> 26:20.560]  line went to his brother and said let's bomb some of our south american embassies and actually kill
[26:20.560 --> 26:29.280]  people to be able to take out the communist so the kennedys weren't the complete and total
[26:29.280 --> 26:36.400]  absolute angels uh that everyone said they were but at the point is they were involved
[26:37.120 --> 26:44.000]  or wanted to be involved in false flags and of course jfk uh said no to that but but but bobby
[26:44.000 --> 26:51.520]  wanted to do it and so this is just something's been done for a long time and the british and the
[26:51.520 --> 26:55.920]  french and the spanish would do it they'd go to one of the little coastal towns there was only you
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.160]  know a few dozen people a little hamlet little you know little you know one dock in a few houses
[27:00.160 --> 27:06.400]  and just kill everybody and leave enemy weapons enemy swords they'd even get enemy cannons and
[27:06.400 --> 27:11.200]  fire them into a building so they could have forensics later and say yeah we found a spanish
[27:11.200 --> 27:16.560]  or we found a dutch cannonball and then you know this witness who happened to survive was one of
[27:16.560 --> 27:22.800]  their people they plant saw that it was the french you know i mean that's a false flag folks a false
[27:22.800 --> 27:26.800]  flags also pull up with somebody else's flag like you're friendly and attack them
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.880]  so there's lots of different types of false flags but it is taught in army manuals in special
[27:34.880 --> 27:39.600]  operations and captain and above wiki leaks released this four or five years ago you can look it up
[27:39.600 --> 27:44.720]  on how to stage false flags and it just mentions you're going to take this false flag course now
[27:45.600 --> 27:50.240]  and i'm just going to leave it at that point but i've talked to a lot of military folks and
[27:50.240 --> 27:56.800]  and this is something that's done it's what other governments do it's very nasty it's very bad
[27:58.160 --> 28:03.280]  our founders did not engage in this in fact george washington told his military we don't
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.800]  rape we don't steal we're polite we don't engage in atrocities we treat enemy captured soldiers
[28:08.800 --> 28:14.640]  well and we don't pull dirty tricks is what they called false flags in that day you can read the
[28:14.640 --> 28:22.560]  writings of washington saying we don't do dirty jobs and dirty tricks we lose the moral high ground
[28:22.560 --> 28:26.480]  we're not going to do it and when he died the british ships
[28:28.880 --> 28:35.440]  on us harbors lowered their flags to half mass the same thing happened in england
[28:36.160 --> 28:41.600]  because he was honorable that's what america was born out of it's what the army was born out of
[28:41.600 --> 28:47.840]  and it's unrecognizable today in the leadership that thinks false flags are acceptable the reason
[28:47.840 --> 28:53.840]  you don't see false flags getting pulled as much is because people don't buy it we said it was a
[28:53.840 --> 28:58.400]  false flag as we can look at the mortars until they were saudi arabian indeed it came out months
[28:58.400 --> 29:06.160]  later two chemical attacks in syria blamed on Assad were saudi arabian al qaeda launched chemical
[29:06.160 --> 29:12.080]  attacks to go over obama's red line on the one year anniversary he says you use chemical weapons
[29:12.080 --> 29:16.880]  i'll attack you and then on the one year anniversary they launched chemical attacks
[29:18.320 --> 29:24.880]  on pro Assad forces and then blame Assad and it all came out it was a false flag folks mainstream
[29:24.880 --> 29:30.720]  news six months later said okay and the un said okay it was really al qaeda so we're not saying this
[29:30.720 --> 29:38.640]  is a false flag but if you've got the usual suspects and obama and the they want to come
[29:38.640 --> 29:44.560]  after our guns who knows what will happen who knows what will happen we'll be back and see if we've

[34:12.720 --> 34:17.920]  good news but it's another victim disarmament zone where this is happening we're getting local radio
[34:17.920 --> 34:24.080]  chatter that this could be what we said earlier backfire car whatever that there was a weight
[34:24.080 --> 34:30.160]  facility someone dropped weights and then someone freaked out and thought it was a ptsd shoulder
[34:30.160 --> 34:35.360]  we see this all the time backfires and they evacuate the capital for five six hours hysteria
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.240]  i mean this is the wicked fling when done pursuit we hope that's what it is it could be a real
[34:40.240 --> 34:47.200]  shooter could be somebody committing suicide could be a backfire but we're now 40 50 minutes 45
[34:47.200 --> 34:52.800]  minutes into this first breaking and we still don't know what's going on so we've seen this many
[34:52.800 --> 34:58.560]  times where it isn't a real shooter and then it becomes this hysteria or somebody shoots off fireworks
[34:58.560 --> 35:03.520]  at a college campus everybody you know is shut down for half a day joe biggs reporting for info
[35:03.520 --> 35:08.720]  wars dot com from the new studios what do we know well at this point in time uh we were just told
[35:08.720 --> 35:15.200]  that it could be possibly weights dropped there is a gym inside of building 26 but also inside of
[35:15.200 --> 35:21.120]  building 26 is the hospital's intake center and dormitories for the wounded warriors that come in
[35:21.120 --> 35:26.000]  from combat now there is a children's center there too as well that opens at 5 30 a.m so there's about
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.440]  more than 200 children there on site the police are still actively going from room to room trying
[35:31.440 --> 35:36.560]  to clear out that facility to possibly uh filter out the fact whether or not it is an active shooter
[35:36.560 --> 35:41.760]  now at 8 30 a.m to california highway patrolman uh we're seeing entering the facility at an emergency
[35:41.760 --> 35:47.840]  room in uh entrance at 8 45 a.m swat arrived and stormed the building police have set up
[35:47.840 --> 35:52.640]  perimeters around local schools one at the san diego city college nearby there are more than
[35:52.640 --> 35:58.480]  6 500 personnel at this medical center right now and police like i said are currently going room
[35:58.480 --> 36:05.600]  to room trying to uh find out if this is a possibly a misunderstanding or actually an active shooter
[36:05.600 --> 36:10.560]  now this is happening at the naval medical center in san diego and uh this is something
[36:10.560 --> 36:14.160]  that we're going to continue to monitor and find out what goes on throughout the day all right
[36:14.160 --> 36:21.680]  joe bigs absolutely uh good news that it may be and it's pointing towards a bunch of hysteria
[36:22.320 --> 36:26.720]  that's not good that we're such a fearful nation condition to be afraid of active shooters
[36:26.720 --> 36:32.080]  when they're so incredibly rare amongst the 330 million citizens and 40 million illegals
[36:32.080 --> 36:38.000]  uh but it it just shows how we've been conditioned uh and and hopefully this will be a learning
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.200]  experience for people if it does turn out to be nothing but a more fear thank you joe let's
[36:43.200 --> 36:49.760]  continue to track this now again coming up in a few minutes we're going to be playing the video
[36:50.480 --> 36:58.880]  uh from the article that is up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[36:58.880 --> 37:08.720]  uh dealing with the senator coming out and saying that the military authorization of force is
[37:08.720 --> 37:12.960]  quote international martial law that is in the six minute uh video we're going to be
[37:14.160 --> 37:22.160]  going to that um i want to go to josh active duty naval e six or sentences i d we're not
[37:22.160 --> 37:26.240]  giving you his last name obviously because in this country there's repercussions for free speech but
[37:26.240 --> 37:33.520]  uh he's saying that there were just a bunch of drills there in the last week uh and that this
[37:33.520 --> 37:40.240]  is contributing to the hysteria also let me add if it is a real shooter they had an abc 2020 special
[37:40.880 --> 37:45.440]  more than 16 years ago that as soon as they brought death education into high schools
[37:46.720 --> 37:53.360]  it more than tripled on average the amount of suicides of young people i mean you go have a whole
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.920]  week long course on suicide and how people do it and why they do it and how you tie the rope
[37:57.920 --> 38:02.960]  around your neck and how you hang it on the you know on the coat rack i mean it's crazy
[38:03.680 --> 38:09.040]  of course that then happens the dare program makes kids use drugs it's a fact it's called copycat
[38:09.040 --> 38:15.040]  and you introduce constant mass shooting drills every month at the san bernadino health department
[38:15.040 --> 38:20.560]  facility you are going to get crazy behavior you're going to have people go oh that's something
[38:20.560 --> 38:26.720]  i'm going to do thank god despite they hyped this so much mass shootings are flat overall death by
[38:26.720 --> 38:33.360]  guns with criminals using them is down between 51 and 60 plus percent depending on which justice
[38:33.360 --> 38:38.080]  department number you look on if you don't believe me we run those numbers all the time just type in
[38:38.080 --> 38:46.320]  gun crime down but public has perception it's up or just department numbers crime down using guns
[38:46.320 --> 38:52.080]  over 50 and you will get the admissions they don't like to advertise it but you will find
[38:52.080 --> 38:58.000]  mainstream news even bloomberg has had to report that okay we can run those some of those graphics
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.040]  uh here in the background related story gun crime is plunged but americans think it's up
[39:03.040 --> 39:09.840]  study says la times boom see all right uh let's go to josh active duty navel e6 it's so great
[39:09.840 --> 39:17.760]  that anytime there's an event wildfires shootings uh floods you name it political events we have
[39:17.760 --> 39:22.400]  listeners in every corner of the world so josh thanks for taking the initiative to reach out to
[39:22.400 --> 39:27.280]  us sir no problem man thanks for having me on your show well go ahead and tell us uh the same
[39:27.280 --> 39:32.320]  things you told our reporters all right i've got a little bit of information here i'm currently
[39:32.320 --> 39:37.840]  stationed nearby but i do have some friends that are on the base currently um we'll start off with
[39:37.840 --> 39:42.800]  we've been having active shooter drills pretty frequently for the last month and a half and i
[39:42.800 --> 39:49.040]  know that navel based on the navel medical best san diego just had one last week and we're supposed
[39:49.040 --> 39:56.000]  to have a pretty diverse um amount of drills fire drill bombing drills but we've been dominated by
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.320]  active shooter drills easily for the last couple months and aside from that we've been constant
[40:02.320 --> 40:07.200]  contact with people that are at the hospital right now we have a couple people saying they
[40:07.200 --> 40:14.640]  have heard gunshots so it could be real i'm still hoping that it's not but um or it could be fire
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.680]  crackers it could be a backfire i mean i'm the capital of the us has been evacuated repeatedly
[40:19.680 --> 40:26.160]  for backfires the only problem though i think joe biggs did say that is where we house our ppsd
[40:27.040 --> 40:32.560]  military members so there is that chance but i'm still hoping that it's just hysteria
[40:32.560 --> 40:39.120]  what do you think about the unprecedented move of the base commander putting out on twitter
[40:39.120 --> 40:43.680]  that uh go ahead and fight i mean i love that that's like the beginning of reality coming
[40:43.680 --> 40:49.520]  back into the world oh i love it too i mean the way the story was broke was on the hospital
[40:49.520 --> 40:54.240]  web page facebook and it said run hide or fight and i just wish they would erase the run on hide part
[40:55.040 --> 40:59.840]  but well it comes down to this that whoever you know whoever i'm sure it's the commander or the
[40:59.840 --> 41:04.160]  adjunct that did that will probably be reprimanded because they they tell people get in the fetal
[41:04.160 --> 41:09.280]  position at these military bases you know they rep reprimanded some of the folks at the army navy
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.920]  a marine course center uh that actually fired back at the shooter and finally stopped me this is
[41:13.920 --> 41:20.720]  crazy i remember it's insane i mean uh pretty sure you know i put my check we're in the military
[41:20.720 --> 41:25.920]  we're all trained to use firearms but again the hospital is a gun free zone who knew go figures
[41:25.920 --> 41:32.640]  but i don't know i hope we start trending towards a more realistic approach instead of
[41:32.640 --> 41:37.200]  this cowardly approach we've been doing for a while now what do you make of san bernadino
[41:37.200 --> 41:42.160]  we're two different white people i say that because it could have been all this black lives matter
[41:42.160 --> 41:47.040]  stuff you know some racist black person with an agenda but two white people it turned out
[41:47.040 --> 41:52.080]  saying i saw a blonde-haired blue-eyed guys in tactical gear basically uh running around shooting
[41:52.080 --> 41:57.440]  people and then they had drills that week and the week before i mean they were having weekly drills
[41:57.440 --> 42:03.280]  by the end i mean i believe it like whenever i see any of these events i try and catalog everything
[42:03.280 --> 42:07.680]  that happens immediately because once they get their story straight and what the mainstream media
[42:07.680 --> 42:12.240]  wants to tell us probably not going to be true they have to look back at what the eyewitness is
[42:12.240 --> 42:18.480]  and what the actual initial reports were to try and piece the truth together well a lot of the public
[42:18.480 --> 42:24.160]  you're absolutely right is ignorant about firearms too and it could have been the police exchanging
[42:24.160 --> 42:28.720]  gunfire with them as they ran to their car then the cops in case they shoot somebody or don't
[42:28.720 --> 42:33.040]  know where their bullets were going aren't going to admit they were there until they get told what
[42:33.040 --> 42:38.640]  to do because they don't want to get basically burned that's also part of it uh but if that's
[42:38.640 --> 42:43.040]  the case they you know they need to say what happened because look there are jihadi's coming
[42:43.040 --> 42:47.600]  into this country these people did get sent to the middle east the fbi did try to stop them
[42:47.600 --> 42:52.720]  and that doesn't usually fit the mo uh of a false flag to have people that the fbi is already
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.800]  investigating and the fbi tries to stop them and then they're ordered not to by the justice department
[42:56.800 --> 43:02.960]  so i i i still think the jury's open on that anything else you'd like to add josh uh not
[43:02.960 --> 43:06.720]  right now i mean we're still getting information as it comes in i'm sure we'll hear more students
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.120]  and why it should be pretty much done clearing up the building but if i get anything pertinent
[43:11.120 --> 43:16.640]  i'll be sure to pass it along well just because you are stationed near there and go there obviously
[43:16.640 --> 43:21.120]  for caring things we want to check in with you later in the show or tonight in the aftermath
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.040]  once we learn exactly what happened they may keep this going for you know five six seven
[43:25.040 --> 43:29.200]  hours sometimes they do colleges with where everybody thinks some ass shootings happening
[43:29.200 --> 43:34.240]  and half the time it's not but uh it was bad as that is uh we'll still hope that uh hope that
[43:34.240 --> 43:38.160]  nobody has been hurt thank you so much sir god bless you well thank you god bless all right
[43:38.160 --> 43:43.360]  we're gonna stay in contact with josh and again great job to my crew uh actually getting you
[43:43.360 --> 43:48.480]  know hold up when he emailed getting his credentials double-checking him and then putting him on air
[43:48.480 --> 43:55.360]  that's something CNN and fox don't do they would just put him on air we don't just do that uh when
[43:55.360 --> 44:00.560]  we are having someone as a witness uh we go the extra mile i mean i don't think that's an extra mile
[44:01.280 --> 44:04.880]  especially today with how the internet is you can make it sit in their info so quickly uh
[44:04.880 --> 44:09.120]  and obviously we don't put that out fact when he's done being on the show delete that email get
[44:09.120 --> 44:14.080]  get get get it out of our system i don't want to have his personal info after that's there that's
[44:14.080 --> 44:19.840]  also what we do in protocol with folks info uh we delete stuff once it's come in and once we've used
[44:19.840 --> 44:24.720]  it still the government but once it might be able to reverse engineer and get it uh from
[44:24.720 --> 44:29.040]  somewhere else but that's that's generally not how it works so that's the type of stuff we do to
[44:29.040 --> 44:34.800]  make sure that especially if we use your whistle blowing it's printed off it's filed the email
[44:34.800 --> 44:40.720]  is destroyed and then uh if it's not pertinent to an investigation we're doing it is shredded
[44:41.520 --> 44:46.720]  and sometimes it is burned i routinely take things home in fact i burned something two
[44:46.720 --> 44:51.920]  nights ago in the fireplace uh over uh or the fire pit over my parents i just you know there's
[44:51.920 --> 44:55.280]  nothing particularly secret or you know that secret i just don't want to have it around i burned it
[44:55.920 --> 45:03.760]  so that's that's that's what we do okay continuing here ladies and gentlemen uh let's get into the
[45:03.760 --> 45:12.400]  big news that i've been hyperventilating uh about video senator warns a umf that's authorization
[45:12.400 --> 45:19.440]  use military force bill is declaration of international martial law this resolution
[45:19.440 --> 45:28.080]  is a total rewind uh of the war powers clause of the constitution adan salazar red linked on info
[45:28.080 --> 45:35.360]  wars dot com and there was another article last night up there that just had it linked to that
[45:35.360 --> 45:41.840]  that's why i was saying i saw this last night it was another article so so so what's incredible uh
[45:41.840 --> 45:46.480]  he is it was a curtain demo article i actually had it first last night and he doesn't matter
[45:46.480 --> 45:51.600]  who had it first the point is is that i was hyperventilating over the fact that this wasn't a
[45:51.600 --> 45:57.600]  bigger deal and thank god curt's working so hard and wrote a story about it uh curt next time call
[45:57.600 --> 46:02.400]  me at night when something's this big everybody see see we're close to this tyranny
[46:04.480 --> 46:08.560]  that a lot of times i even see some horrible incredible story that's got to get out and i'm
[46:08.560 --> 46:15.200]  just kind of don't report on it because i'm so burnt out seeing all this evil and then it never
[46:15.200 --> 46:20.800]  even gets reported it'll just be some blurb in an article that's bombshell sensational and then i
[46:20.800 --> 46:24.720]  don't get somebody to write an article about it or you don't call it and say why didn't you cover it
[46:24.720 --> 46:30.080]  and then drudge doesn't link to it we don't put it on facebook and it doesn't change history i mean
[46:30.080 --> 46:35.200]  it's that it's that i'm having an anxiety attack right now i mean i was flipping out during breaks
[46:35.200 --> 46:40.400]  earlier i mean not in a bad way but just literally hyperventilating because that's a normal response
[46:40.400 --> 46:48.480]  to a senator on the floor talking about martial law and no one cares and see if they can do this
[46:48.480 --> 46:56.400]  i'm just having bone bone shaking chills right now that's a normal response folks but people
[46:56.400 --> 47:01.760]  aren't having these responses that's why we're in so much trouble they're going to take everybody's
[47:01.760 --> 47:05.360]  pension funds they're going to rob the stock market they're going to take your bank accounts
[47:05.360 --> 47:11.120]  they're getting it all lined up if they get away with it it's like getting a call from
[47:11.120 --> 47:15.360]  your neighbor saying hey you know there's a guy with a gun on your shed and you get that adrenaline
[47:15.360 --> 47:21.840]  rush in that chill or you know you get that call and they say uh hey you're uh you know your sister's
[47:21.840 --> 47:29.600]  in the hospital that's the feeling i have because our country is if we just had the normal response
[47:29.600 --> 47:34.800]  to get freaked out we'd get upset we'd have a chain reaction we'd take action but people instead get
[47:34.800 --> 47:42.640]  upset about the nfl and i'm not against the nfl but they've taken your normal primitive response
[47:42.640 --> 47:47.600]  to a threat the threat isn't when your team loses a two-point conversion
[47:49.360 --> 47:55.920]  the threat is when foreign evil multinationals run by george soros and others worse than a
[47:55.920 --> 48:03.680]  james bond villain are actually taking us over and want to politically persecute the
[48:03.680 --> 48:14.640]  middle class and are trying to start race wars i mean whoa whoa people i mean and see what's
[48:14.640 --> 48:19.760]  happening to me right now is i'm owning this right now realizing how much i've gotten to where i'm
[48:19.760 --> 48:25.680]  just comfortable with it i've even gotten comfortable with my own death or my own imprisonment that's
[48:25.680 --> 48:33.600]  not good people say we need to erase fear with a pill no i need fear actually i need to get
[48:33.600 --> 48:40.240]  motivated i need to get animated let's go to the clip a new bill making its way through congress
[48:40.240 --> 48:43.920]  contains dangerous and unprecedented language that could be considered a declaration of
[48:43.920 --> 48:49.280]  international martial law u.s senator warned last week and no one covered it the resolution is a
[48:49.280 --> 48:53.280]  total rewrite of the war powers clause the constitution let's be clear about that democrat
[48:53.280 --> 48:59.600]  senator christ murphy sent on the senate floor last week in regards to sj res 29 a bill supporting
[48:59.600 --> 49:04.880]  reporting to give the sitting u.s president the power to declare war on isis but that it says
[49:04.880 --> 49:09.200]  or anyone else anywhere else for any reason in perpetuity forever ron paul says it's
[49:09.200 --> 49:14.640]  with the worst war declaration ever now let's you know what i'm going to go to break them back with

[54:32.720 --> 54:36.720]  they didn't even do that to everybody there and then they're gonna go after the guns that's associated
[54:36.720 --> 54:48.480]  press i mean uh what soros is up to i just i cannot believe we're in the hands of such criminals
[54:48.480 --> 54:55.040]  but then there's also good news you know they say that not just a character in the x-files and the
[54:55.040 --> 55:00.720]  x-files based on alex jones one of the big characters the omali character but also the
[55:00.720 --> 55:08.400]  topics they cover are infowars topics that's what chris carter said and i watched it last night it
[55:08.400 --> 55:15.280]  was about eugenics and human animal chimeras which is actually mainstream news now but at least
[55:15.280 --> 55:20.160]  it's getting now covered in popular culture but is that being done not by carter but are they
[55:20.160 --> 55:24.000]  letting it go on air because then people will think that's the x-files and not reality that's
[55:24.000 --> 55:31.360]  what's crazy is what i watched last night is what they're doing i don't know the chimeras are psychic
[55:31.360 --> 55:38.000]  and are kind of magical powers but i mean they're doing it and there's mit review right on screen
[55:38.000 --> 55:46.640]  human animal chimeras are gestating on us research farms they're not growing the humanoids in
[55:46.640 --> 55:52.480]  other women you know scully ask am i was i an incubator for you know one of these hybrids no
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.040]  sweetheart they use cows and pigs for that because they don't try to run off the base
[55:57.040 --> 56:02.160]  like the women do in the last x-files so whatever and i'm done talking about the x-files it was
[56:02.160 --> 56:09.360]  kind of fun at first and interesting and then then it gives me a headache because then i started
[56:10.400 --> 56:15.840]  i just you know what i know homeland security showed up and threatened everybody with the
[56:15.840 --> 56:20.640]  martial law piece i did with ventura the serious piece that aired in the second season and it never
[56:20.640 --> 56:26.080]  aired again and was erased off everybody's dvrs for a reason because it exposed the entire takeover
[56:26.080 --> 56:30.560]  plan and if you watch that video that you can barely find as they take it off youtube you will
[56:30.560 --> 56:34.000]  know they're playing and of course that was three four years ago now you see it's happening
[56:35.520 --> 56:39.200]  and i'm not at liberty because when you sign up with folks in journalism and things are off
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.360]  record when things are off record i can't tell you the stuff that went on in fact i just kind of
[56:43.360 --> 56:49.040]  started breaking confidence there just telling you some of the things that happened at a certain
[56:49.040 --> 56:54.960]  point man i just can't shut up anymore folks you need to know how real this is okay i mean it's real
[56:54.960 --> 57:01.200]  if you were in my position and did what i did you'd know we're in trouble people we can't screw
[57:01.200 --> 57:07.040]  around anymore let's go to the senator u.s senator democrat saying martial law bill worldwide here it
[57:07.040 --> 57:12.080]  is madam president today um i wanted to come down to the floor and speak very briefly about a
[57:12.960 --> 57:18.160]  resolution that the majority leader introduced i believe earlier today this is an authorization
[57:18.160 --> 57:24.560]  for military force resolution that apparently purports to give the president legal authority
[57:24.560 --> 57:30.400]  to conduct military operations against isis before we break for the weekend madame president i thought
[57:30.400 --> 57:38.800]  it was important to come to the floor to explain why very briefly to my colleagues um excuse me to
[57:38.800 --> 57:49.040]  explain what this resolution really is um this resolution is a total rewrite of the war powers
[57:49.040 --> 57:56.400]  clause of the united states constitution let's be clear about that it is essentially a declaration of
[57:56.400 --> 58:04.400]  international martial law a sweeping transfer of military power to the president that will allow
[58:04.400 --> 58:14.080]  him or her to send us troops almost anywhere in the world for almost any reason with absolutely no
[58:14.080 --> 58:19.760]  limitations and the full six minute speech is on info wars dot com right now we're just gonna

[58:35.680 --> 58:40.960]  i mean that's scary folks that's why we're so important and i don't like being that important

[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:34.560]  well then he gets into the evidence uh actually in the piece that's up on info wars dot com
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.240]  and then he points out how that's like the politically correct people screaming ban halloween
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.080]  you know i want the professor fired and yelling and screaming and he ties it all together with
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:51.520]  political correctness and just this victimology thing what the blms doing is horrible what's
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.360]  happening with land grabs is terrible we go and cover we went and covered the bunnies we've covered
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:02.480]  the texas situation with the red river we're sitting day and night out to utah uh to go cover
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:07.760]  very soon a bunch of land grabbing and and state reps and and and and people being harassed by the
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:13.360]  government and county commensures being arrested for simply saying hey we're going to leave these
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.960]  four-wheeler trails open that have been open forever they're trying to kick people off the
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:27.120]  public land but they've had people arrested driving the blm vehicles they uh the psiop people mailed
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:33.280]  literally hundreds of sex toys and 55 gallon drums of lubricant to them and then they flip out
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.400]  and say don't send us more of these and get mad on camera so then hundreds of newspapers put
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:43.040]  put articles in saying send them more of these so reportedly there's just warehouses of sex toys now
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:49.200]  i mean just walking into the psiops and then can we pull the substance i mentioned it the suma wrestler

[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:23.760]  thing's being orchestrated by known quantities and it's people that are getting off i mean you
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:29.120]  see them when they're on foxes and stuff with these crazy looks on their eyes like i'm a tv star now

[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.880]  it does is make us look bad when when we've got the globalist why do you think they're not moving in
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.280]  on them why do you think they say you can stay there for years because they're getting millions of
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.360]  dollars of news coverage a day in hundreds of newspapers and on tv as a laughing stock
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.680]  as a laughing stock

[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:28.400]  great news town hall dot com reporting fox news also reporting info wars dot com also
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:33.120]  reporting this 30 minutes ago that it appeared to be a hoax it appeared to be a the wicked flea
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:38.240]  when none pursued a quote from the bible where they have these active shooting drills every month
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:44.400]  creating copycat shooters making it part of the culture demonizing guns and creating the perception
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:50.880]  that there's massive shootings going on everywhere when crime using guns is down between 51 and 61
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:57.680]  percent from 1992 just search engine gun crime plummets perception is it's up just like when
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:04.640]  jaws came out in 72 for the next decade beach going went down upwards of half they had to put
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:11.040]  newspaper ads in nationwide saying less than 10 people died a year normally five from great whites
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.280]  now more people die from guns but it's a little over a thousand in the u.s every year that are
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:24.240]  killed in a criminal act or murdered the police there's a lot of police brutality and problems but
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.880]  we're talking maybe 150 people that they questionably kill on their end is that the number one
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:34.880]  issue no they want civil war on the ground they want destabilization they want to have a false
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:40.880]  revolution against american institutions to bring in globalism that's what bernie sanders wants
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:48.480]  it's how the communists operate this is bankers mega elite tax exempt using a totalitarian communist
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:53.040]  and fascist template they borrowed from an all carol quickly wrote tragedy and hope only a
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:59.040]  thousand copies were published for the state department and cia in the 60s so they can understand
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.920]  we fund fascists we fund communists we fund dictators we fund you know the left and right's
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:11.760]  controlled and he explains the synthesis in the 1100 page book we sell at infowarstore.com
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.760]  because patriots just got the plates and printed it no matter what they said and there was lawsuits
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:20.000]  and everything but still it turned out to be basically fair use and that book is available
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.960]  today it's also online if you read 1100 pages you'll understand things like i do because it's
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:32.640]  a state department manual on evil and to sell the state department on how to commit macky of alien
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:39.040]  acts and and why it was for a greater good yes there's a world government yes we're totalitarian

[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:07.840]  think it's not true think we're the x files and then tune out no we will pull up a senate page
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.320]  murphy is u.s senator let's let's put it on screen and they're also saying that the legislation
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.080]  doesn't say that yes it does we have a link to it at thomas dot loc dot gov in these articles
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:24.480]  now remember you're awake you're not being targeted so much in the siob there is chris murphy
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:30.560]  united states senator for connecticut okay they're targeting the 60 percent that aren't really
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:36.880]  brain damage they're just only experts on football acting cool wearing sports jerseys watching porn
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:43.760]  they're afraid that those groups will start getting into reality and then learn oh my gosh the
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.080]  senator just said this they know most college grads can't say who their senator is or senators are
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:53.280]  or the three branches of government ten percent of college grads in a big poll last week scientific
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:59.280]  believes that judge judy heads up the supreme court so you need to understand folks this is how
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:05.120]  much they hate you and how stupid they think you are and we're following these ip's and do a report
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.400]  on it they're sock puppets it's nice it's it's a you know a person at a computer running hundreds
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:16.320]  of comments at a time and spewing racism you name it to make us all fight they'll have blacks
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.800]  acting like they're racist whites acting like they're racist it's not real folks it's most of
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.800]  its sock puppets to then get the racial infighting starting and when you think about that they
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:31.040]  legalize the cia engaged in disinformation last year in the us that's unprecedented folks
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.840]  in propaganda and it's already been going on with 16 agencies but now the gloves are off
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:41.120]  it's had the blowback though with people in government are freaking out over so let's go
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.800]  ahead and play this clip and then go to our guest mr. steel former cia ground commander
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.640]  and actual operations you have to think there's tons of cia and other agencies that are paper
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:56.240]  pushers and make contract money and do you know analysis and and and then there's a very small
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.080]  group that's actually on the ground you know back in his day it was a lot more because there wasn't
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.400]  all the electronic surveillance but you know i mean you know the more james bondy type that's
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.840]  that's that's mr. steel that everybody glorifies and you know talks about where you can actually
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.160]  get your head blown off uh and you know i had family that was actually in intelligence on the
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.160]  ground as well that's why growing up i was told the government brings in the drugs the government
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.720]  stages terror attacks the government's evil don't ever join the government uh i mean i just grew up
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:25.360]  hearing that from uncles and cuz you know great uncles and cousins and people and they're like
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.880]  and we can't even get out of this uh so the the problem the system has is there are patriots in
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.760]  the government and and they grow up and learn about this and then try to stop it but they're
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:40.720]  now recruiting a bunch of yuppies and trendies in who actually think tyranny is cool but it's
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.720]  weird they're like analysts and people and and want to be spies they've never killed anybody
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.920]  never stopped anybody's head in never poisoned anybody never been tortured never and so it's
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:55.280]  like a limp brigade of these new agents coming at us and you they're just trash folks and if a
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:59.280]  civil war starts they're gonna get their ass handed to them i don't it doesn't matter how many tinker
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.080]  toys they've got but i'm gonna stop ranting let's go to this clip of the u.s senator because this
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.880]  is such a big deal here it is madam president today um i wanted to come down to the floor to
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:14.400]  speak very briefly about a resolution that the majority leader introduced i believe earlier
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:21.600]  today this is an authorization for military force resolution that apparently purports to give the
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:27.280]  president legal authority to conduct military operations against isis um before we break for
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.240]  the weekend madam president i thought it was important to come to the floor to explain why
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:40.240]  very briefly to my colleagues um excuse me to explain what this resolution really is
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:50.000]  this resolution is a total rewrite of the war powers clause of the united states constitution
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.800]  let's be clear about that it is essentially a declaration of international martial law
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:04.960]  law a sweeping transfer of military power to the president that will allow him or her to send us
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:13.120]  troops almost anywhere in the world for almost any reason with absolutely no limitations
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.800]  that's the senator the real senator you can read it for yourself i'm gonna skip this network
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.840]  right to give more time i want to get him more and more often than just every six months that's
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:27.760]  wise back this week uh to just give us his view on military developments operations that are happening
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.920]  because of how much experience robert david steel dot com you know there was other news sites by
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:38.160]  going there robert david steels a former marine cik case officer us spy hacker ceo of open source
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:43.200]  solutions network and a 2012 candidate for a foreign party presidential nomination currently
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.720]  ceo of the earth intelligence network an accredited educational nonprofit and he's the guy that coined
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:54.400]  open source intelligent uh teaching mid career officials from across 66 governments in his
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.280]  day the foremost proponent of applied collective intelligence which integrates holistic analytics
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:04.480]  true cost economics and open source everything the ladder and engineering and information management
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:09.040]  approach that is affordable and then goes through and scalable he's contributing author of another
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:14.320]  french false flag uh bloody tracks from paris to san bernadino and we've just had another
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.200]  of these shooting hysteria as it turns out to be just that another drill uh that they're fear
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:24.400]  mongering uh mr steel i just have been ranting here obviously you probably want to respond
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.040]  to this authorization for military force first then i'll give you the floor till the 30 break
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:34.720]  to cover uh other breaking info and then i've got my questions after the break well i i always love
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:41.200]  watching you uh lead up to uh to my coming on and and you have been on a roll alex but i absolutely
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:50.240]  agree with you um violence is down uh a lot of people are out of work unemployment the united
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:56.240]  states is at least 23 percent across the board and it's more like 40 percent among the young people
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:04.640]  of color uh single moms with kids and uh older people uh i'm very proud of america i think we've
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:11.680]  controlled ourselves very well and all of this uh scare mongering about guns is an ideological
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:17.840]  crusade that is not rooted in fact you're absolutely right now let's go to this war powers provision
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:25.840]  um one of the problems that we have is that congress has been bought and paid for uh congress is
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:32.720]  now in a treasonous state it is in violation of article one of the constitution uh which is the
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:40.480]  balance of powers act uh it is absolutely outrageous that the united states has such a
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:49.280]  presence overseas and is engaged in armed violent operations in over 130 countries we are killing
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:57.200]  people in over 130 countries between drone assassinations being run by the cia joint special
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:03.280]  operations group and other black mercenary operations that are funded and paid for not
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:09.920]  just by the taxpayer but by borrowing against the future of our children so i personally believe
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:16.640]  a constitutional convention is absolutely necessary now i've shared with you alex my letter to
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:24.000]  governor abbott and i have to tell you governor abbott has morons reading his mail um i got back
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.880]  a form letter and you're free to post my letter to governor abbott i'd be glad to have everybody
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:35.920]  read it because i think the governor has not read it a brain dead intern saw two words constitutional
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:42.880]  convention and sent me a form letter explaining things i already know uh such as and you're
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:46.880]  trying to get through to him he's been over in europe on a trade junket uh but i actually run
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.360]  into a sheet of staff and actually know him i'll i'll make sure it gets uh delivered to him well
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.000]  god bless you alex because i think this would be good for texas and it would be good for the
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.640]  governor because a virtual i have got our email as a result of my last appearance on your show
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:10.800]  than ever before everybody loves the idea of a virtual constitutional convention one in which
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:17.920]  governor abbott hosts a constitutional convention and invites your counterpart on radio mark levin
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:23.120]  a great american who's written the book on the constitutional convention and let's have it out
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:28.480]  let's have your plan is that the way to get it launched is to have the mock one bring in a
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:34.320]  bunch of people wargame and have c span cover it uh it'll make the governor a huge star he needs
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:39.200]  to support they're attacking him it'll be a bully pulpit and then that can help organize and make
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:45.600]  sure the con con we have is constitutional and patriot man absolutely right alex and and perhaps
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.000]  even more to the point it will demonstrate how shallow and ignorant all of the presidential
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:57.200]  candidates with the exception of john kaseach and maybe ted cruz are you're saying we take over the
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:05.040]  narrative and actually inject reality yes it's time the american public took back its government
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:11.440]  and a virtual con con is how we do that and governor abbott if he can get past his idiot staff is
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:16.640]  the man who can do it well in fairness he's very popular i know he gets over a thousand letters
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:22.160]  a week but uh we'll uh try to get it through to him it's just that and it's not just him alex i've
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:27.760]  had this problem with the u.s government the problem is that people put interns on the front
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:35.600]  end of their mail and interns don't have the depth of knowledge to actually see big ideas coming at
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:41.600]  them like you just uh flashed on that thing they see two words constitutional convention and they
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:47.520]  send out a form letter that says oh yes this is something that requires 34 states out of the 50
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:54.960]  to ask for duh okay so i would be really thrilled if you got the chief of staff to the governor
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:00.720]  to actually read this letter because i also believe that the university of texas admiral
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:07.040]  mcgraven one of our great american heroes the university of texas has a role to play it can
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:13.280]  run an electoral reform summit it could run an unemployment workshop nothing makes me crazier
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:20.240]  than people like rachel madow calling people like you and me uh unemployment truthers when we're
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:25.600]  trying to explain that the reality in america is that most of us are either unemployed or we're
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:31.520]  juggling two or three jobs without benefits just to try to make ends meet at a time when inflation
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:36.160]  is still rising absolutely i know so many people with two three four degrees that are hard working
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:41.040]  that are bagging groceries and then running some other little small business on the side and then
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.360]  literally you know going and and running catering businesses and stuff to try to pay all the bills
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.920]  i mean i know people that are smarter than i am i talked about a real person there that that you
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:54.000]  know actually is a manager at a grocery store runs a catering company uh and has a little internet
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.520]  business and you know that's to try to live a middle-class life yes well we've we've killed
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:04.880]  ourselves and one of the things i do not like about donald trump is that he's basically lying to
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:13.440]  the public uh china did not take our jobs uh our ceo's gave them our jobs because we have a two-party
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:21.200]  tyranny that is basically what matt tabby calls in his brilliant book griftopia the merger of of
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:29.440]  politics political crime and financial crime uh i believe that it's time now for someone like
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:35.120]  governor casique and governor abbott and maybe even governor o'Malley to come out and point out
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:42.720]  to america that's 60 of the electoral uh public has been disenfranchised by the two-party tyranny
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:47.840]  and if we go into a new election let's say mike bloomberg runs that's actually good because he'll
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:54.880]  pull votes from hillary clinton or or uh bernie sanders who i consider a fraud um but the bottom
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:00.720]  line here is we need a clean sheet fresh start we need by the way bumper as you predicted last week
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:06.080]  came out three days later and said he may run uh and of course we've also got biden talking about
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:11.200]  running now uh what's your view on hillary i mean she is in so much trouble she's having in fact we
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.960]  have the video coughing fits she looks let me be crystal clear i think clail hillary clinton is a
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:25.440]  dishonest incompetent toad uh she has absolutely no redeeming virtues she kicked al gore out of the
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:32.080]  vice president's office in the old executive office building she treats people well very very
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:38.480]  badly all of my secret service contacts say that they will never ever again work for her
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:46.800]  she is a dishonest cruel uh self person i absolutely think that anybody who votes for
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:51.600]  hillary clinton is an idiot i have interviewed jim tucker the late great jim tucker that exposed
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:56.640]  bill berg which is the secret devils for new viewers and listeners he said that they tell
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:02.160]  people do not look in her eyes she doesn't tip she treats the smallest people and tells them you are
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:07.600]  scum she is so hateful even to her staff they said that and then i had a chance infiltrating
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.080]  bill berg quite a few times to actually then go back the days after now they just close it for
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.520]  days after so i have trouble and talk to the staff who wouldn't talk to me especially english
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:20.080]  speakers in virginia and the police and everybody and and you know the first few days they won't
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.440]  talk to us but then after that they go oh here's the documents they're horrible we've never been
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.320]  treated so bad these are evil men it's like a james bond movie is what they say that is that
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:36.000]  specter the truth teller the truth teller on hillary clinton is is the guy in charge of the
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.200]  congressional commission that she worked for is on the record is saying that he would never ever
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:48.080]  hire her again she was dishonest beginning in her days as a congressional staffer this is
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:53.840]  not a that's right he said on watergate she was a total criminal snake yes absolutely and now let's
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:58.800]  do she commit some crimes and got away with it on that hearing it was it was a bunch of stuff
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:06.960]  she proposed illegal activities as part of trying to win this is a woman who will do anything to get
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:13.440]  her way even if it's an unamerican unconstitutional way in this she's very like henry kissing her
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:18.880]  who joked that the illegal we do immediately the unconstitutional takes a little longer
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:24.960]  hillary clinton is an unconstitutional person and should absolutely not be considered nor should
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:29.520]  bernie sanders frank so i ask you this who do you think are the because i mean these guys like
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:36.800]  george solz and uh james baker and kissinger are kind of fading out uh rockefeller reportedly now
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:41.520]  is you know at almost 100 like it's like 98 does have dementia but comes in and out he was the king
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:47.200]  bentel five years ago they tried to have his you know his nephew jay do it but he's not as as as
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:52.400]  on the ball obviously uh the word is brazinski's right up there at the top but still it's kissinger
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.120]  like general jones said five years ago in the council on foreign relations publication
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.320]  i get my orders from henry kissinger every day when he headed up the national security council
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:09.200]  that was a serious quote who globally are are really running things realistically kissing
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:14.960]  her and brazinski are the best of the servant class okay there's servants they're not rulers of men
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:20.080]  they take their orders from the banking families no i understand so so like they're the top front
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:24.480]  men or the imperial legates like when the old roman emperors would would send a general out
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:30.880]  who spoke in the voice of the emperor in the voice of soran right exactly and the reason we
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:36.640]  need a constitutional convention the reason we need an electoral reform summit which i would love
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:42.480]  to have ron paul and denis casinich from across the aisle be the lead people together with jesse
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:48.080]  ventura synthia mckinney jillstein and of course all of the presidential candidates now running
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.880]  should be invited to appear so that all of them can demonstrate how shallow they are with the
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:58.480]  possible exception of john casique uh i mean i think casique is going to come out of of the next
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:05.200]  month ahead of the game and i don't know if you've picked this up but there is a wild wild story on
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:13.120]  mario rubio as a gay prostitute as a teenager wane madsen one of your investigative journalism
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:18.240]  counterparts has come out with this i think this story has legs and i think it's going to deepen
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:23.520]  and larry ellison absolutely we're getting wane on uh in fact let's try to get wane on the fourth
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:28.000]  hour today or even the third hour for 10 minutes on that and then and i did see that article and
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.520]  i meant to have a meeting about it and and got i mean i've got uh grab that article grab that
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.640]  article absolutely and i've got uh you know women connected uh to the clinton saying they're worried
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:44.000]  that they're going to kill them that's up on drudge report dot com i mean this is just the news is
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.080]  insane nowadays well you know alex one of the good things is it's no longer is easy to kill people
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:56.480]  and get away with it as it used to be uh i think america is ready for truth and reconciliation
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:02.960]  moment and one of the reasons i strongly hope that governor casique and ted crews among others will
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:09.200]  come in in favor of an electoral reform summit is because we need to get all americans back into
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:14.880]  the process of democracy and the easy way to achieve peace and prosperity in the united states of
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.840]  america is to restore integrity to our government and that's what the electoral reform summit would
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:27.440]  do in time to elect libertarians and constitution working parties even justice uh and working
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:33.120]  families uh members to congress that breaks the back of the two-party tyranny that restores sure
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.480]  that's why they're trying to divide and conquer us stay there mr steele we're going to come back
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.360]  and get into uh the threats against uh people that have been exposing the clinton's what's
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:45.280]  happening with the economy and we're going to put the phones up your questions for mr steele
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:54.240]  stay with us i'm alex shows we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:23.680]  the the other side if you if you go to that website you'll see websites over on the other end the
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:30.880]  the blog which also has the donate button since i have no salary pension or savings the blog is uh
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:38.080]  five beta iota dot net that's like five beta kappa but iota for smart people uh so five beta iota
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:45.040]  dot net is the blog where i curate over 80 really top people from around the world uh who do public
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:52.000]  intelligence in the public interest um and then the political site is big bat usa.org which i'm
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.320]  trying to turn over uh to anybody who will support electoral reform because i believe there are 100
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:05.200]  million pissed off voters who would pay $10 each for a liberty fund to basically buy our government
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:14.240]  back um so five beta iota dot net and big bat usa.org are two of the two sites all right let's go
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:18.480]  going back to this war powers authorization for me that's such a huge deal ron paul saying it's
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.680]  tyranny the democrat senator saying it's worldwide martial law or his exact quote declaration of
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:28.320]  international martial law it's not martial law itself but it's the authorization of it i mean
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.000]  this is unprecedented and this is the republicans trying to do this i guess because they want the
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:38.400]  power when obama leaves what a sick group the republican leadership is well i agree and i frankly
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:43.360]  support the tea party members of the republican party who are telling the republican party to
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:49.440]  stick it newt gingrich did a lot of damage to the republican party he turned members into
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:55.280]  foot soldiers who were required to vote the party line regardless of what their constituents wanted
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:02.000]  that's something we need to turn back um we need to get every member of congress to
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:08.320]  sign an oath that they will pull their constituents and represent their constituents
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:14.640]  that's not happening today and if governor abbott were to have a virtual con con one of the issues
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:21.680]  we should be discussing is the elimination of executive orders which are unconstitutional
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:28.880]  we should be discussing a congressional demand for a grand strategy review ron paul did a great
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:36.800]  book his collection of his speeches on on peace and and uh and a foreign policy of peace friendship
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:42.560]  and commerce you know i'm a former marine as you know and i created the marine core intelligence
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:48.800]  center i believe we need to strengthen our military however donald trump is an idiot when
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:54.720]  he says he wants to give more money to the military right now the military is taking up 60 of our
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:02.400]  discretionary budget 16 of the total budget and it's documented at 50 waste we have a hollow
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:08.880]  military we need a 450 ship navy right now we have more admirals than we have ships
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.600]  we need a long haul air force we need an air war we're saying the problem isn't money it's that
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:18.960]  there's a bunch of special interest robbing everything with with the new joint strike fighter
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:25.360]  that cost over a billion dollars a piece and isn't even as good as an f f 15 they admit i mean isn't
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:32.320]  that sedition and treason and sabotage to build guantanamo should be reserved for lockheed martin
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:40.480]  executives um the reality here general robert scales did a wonderful study the infantry is four
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:47.040]  percent of the force and takes 80 percent of the casualties the infantry in the pentagon gets
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.960]  one percent of the budget one percent the boots on the ground of the total muscle the assassins
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:58.000]  the killers the humet they do it all and then we have all this big fancy junk that basically does
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:05.760]  nothing 99 of the pentagon budget is fraud waste and abuse and nobody robert gates this is the
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:11.600]  first thing robert gates has said recently that i've agreed with on charlie rose he said nobody
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:16.240]  in washington gets fired for being incompetent they get fired for having sexual activities
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:22.560]  outside of marriage which the clintons and others have had a lot of but they don't get fired for
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:29.040]  being incompetent the fact is that 45 percent of our weapons acquisitions programs are fraud
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:34.720]  waste and abuse that's documented 75 percent of our expenditures in afghanistan are fraud
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:40.000]  waste and abuse that's done now let's conversely look at the russians um uh from your analysis of
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.560]  what they're doing um it looks like they're really trying to stand up some really serious
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:51.120]  weapon systems that challenge us superiority well yes and no alex i mean one of the problems
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.640]  that people don't realize is that all militaries have the same problem we do uh i remember when
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:01.600]  the cold war ended and some of our generals flew into russia to what they thought were really
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:06.960]  advanced air bases with the most modern missiles possible their pilot was actually concerned because
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:13.280]  there were potholes on the runways yes all right um i will tell you right now i have a briefing
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:19.360]  that's coming out on the 28th that says very clearly that saudi arabia which has spent 100
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:24.800]  billion dollars on state sponsored terrorism is the number one enemy of the united states
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:31.680]  it's not the russians you've been in the militia in many operations what is the real saudi plan
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:36.480]  i mean they play at every level they fund all the major uh wahhabis terror groups unfortunately
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.760]  there's there's a saudi end in israeli plan but let's just focus on the saudi plan the saudi
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:48.640]  plan is to basically recreate the caliphate and go all the way to indonesia um and the saudi's
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:52.960]  are delusional if they think they can achieve this because they're doing it on the backs of
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:44:00.800]  everybody else we have ignored saudi state sponsored terrorism since 1988 it's time that stopped
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.560]  well they're now trying to manipulate us television us media they've even jacked with us
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:12.080]  they've jacked with other major authors i know i'm not going to get into the inside baseball
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:16.560]  because i've been asked not to talk about it but they are actively involved in the united states
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.120]  with intelligence operatives and and people and they really are getting too big for the
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:27.280]  branches in my view well i agree alex and one of the problems that i have here is that the united
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:33.040]  states government is not making evidence-based decisions ambassador mark palmer wrote an excellent
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:37.440]  book on breaking the real axis of evil in which he pointed out that the u.s government is best
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:43.760]  pals with 42 of the 44 dictators on the planet the only two that we don't like are in north korean
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:52.480]  cuba um the united states government is misrepresenting the u.s public it is essentially a form of
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:58.400]  fascist or corporate owned government and it is in the business of arms sales and looting other
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:03.840]  and now no one can deny that and now they want to loot america even more and bring in a cashless
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:09.280]  society and shut down the family farms with their rural affairs commission run by the pentagon
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:14.720]  and we got u.s senators admitting we're going under martial law legislation i mean it's just
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:21.920]  sensational but it's all happening well you know mark tabby in his book uh griftopia which i recommend
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.760]  or any book i mentioned you can read my summary of the book at amazon mark tabby says that the elites
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:33.600]  have decided that we are expendable they're basically planning to hollow out america and
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:39.200]  leave us all for for dead meat and move to switzerland that's what that's what brosinski said he said
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:44.880]  it's cheaper to kill a million people now than to propagandize them well actually yes it is but
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.840]  what what's interesting and the reason that i'm the pioneer for the open source everything movement
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:56.320]  open source everything engineering is because i can move a million people to a northeastern
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:02.800]  part of somalia that has dirt sunlight and seawater and for $500 per person i can create
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:10.640]  a thriving a metropolis $500 per person if you use open source everything engineering
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.040]  all right so that's not only open source technology open source so they're blocking what you're doing
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:21.440]  calling it um you know conflicting or disruptive technology to freeze us in a stone age level
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:26.480]  while they consolidate the wealth of power and tax exempt above the law diplomatically immune
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:33.200]  globalist reservations even artificial islands they are building a breakaway civilization yes they
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:39.360]  are but i don't think it will succeed as the wealthy in new york found out in 1920 infectious
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:45.920]  disease does not spare popes presidents and and uh billionaires uh we're all in this together
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:50.960]  this is one massive spaceship earth and the good news yeah one of these crazy people thinking
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:56.160]  they've built a time bomb allowing the population to explode claiming it's overpopulated in their
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:01.920]  royal commission in 49 but deciding to overpopulate in their view not allow development to create a
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:06.800]  giant slave squalor to then leverage production under globalism in the name of building up the
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:12.240]  third world to actually betray and deindustrialize the west and impoverish it to knock out a middle
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:18.160]  class competitor class and bring in worldwide squalor as a political tool and now all they've
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:23.520]  done is created a giant time bomb that could blow the whole spaceship up these people are psychopaths
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:29.840]  well now alex there they're they're good people trapped in a in an ivory tower one of the problems
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:34.480]  with the really rich people as well as high-level political people is they're surrounded by ask
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.480]  answers yes they're surrounded by people who want to protect their jobs at all costs and these
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:47.760]  people are out of touch with reality i am a top intelligence analyst i do holistic analytics
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:53.040]  true cost economics and open source everything engineering and right now nobody wants to buy
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:58.880]  that even denver and india that are doing some really great smart cities initiatives they're
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:05.520]  wrong they think a smart city is about is about digital connectivity it's not it's about building
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:12.960]  a city that doesn't have true costs so heavy that it cannot be continued forever okay water
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.440]  costs for example it's it's truly self-sufficient i've read your material it's amazing folks you
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:23.200]  read your book but i mean and your essays but but let's experience we're about to go to calls here the
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:31.440]  establishment does not want self-sufficient local systems because it wants control it sells tyranny
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:36.400]  as sustainability but it's the opposite of sustainability you're pushing real sustainability
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:41.280]  so that's how these things get confusing but i just want to add this when i say we're overpopulated
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:47.840]  they made the decision to overpopulate because they didn't scale the clean farming systems
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:52.400]  and systems they knew were there the british government is had a commission and it's all
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:56.960]  there and actually plan the future out this got adopted by a bunch of other people folks
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.800]  and and so they built an unsustainable system on purpose to then be able to control everybody
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:06.560]  it's not that i'm saying we're overpopulated i'm saying with the system we've built we're
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.600]  overpopulated mr. steel do you agree or disagree i agree and i can make all these problems go away
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:18.160]  the fastest way to control population is with education food and housing as soon as you do that
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:23.280]  people stop having too many babies and i also believe that's what the commission said and they
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:28.240]  said we're not going to do that well there are going to do that and the good news for them is
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:33.920]  we're not going to burn them down well absolutely how do they ever think they're going to get away
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:40.560]  with this when the words are already out what they did hey i i think these people live in a
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.520]  delusional world i mean look at this guy that jacked up drugs to 700 bucks and now he's he's
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:51.440]  looking at a jail term these people really think that they are in charge and what they don't understand
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:57.120]  is that they have been living on tolerance they have been living on the bubble now that the bubble
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:05.120]  has burst now that everybody is paying attention i mean i'm disgusted with with forbes for example
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:09.920]  they just had an article about how the system is rigged but they can't bring themselves to discuss
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:17.440]  the fact that 60 of all americans have been completely disenfranchised libertarians constitution
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:22.560]  green reform natural law they were greedy they rigged it to steal everything instead of just
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:27.520]  rigging it to put themselves in charge what dumb managers even if they're going to be corrupt to
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:34.320]  screw everyone well i agree alex and i'm hoping and this is why governor abbott has an opportunity
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:41.040]  to rise to save america if he sponsors a virtual concon an electoral reform summit he changes
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.720]  everything well i agree he can't just sit there and call for the idea and look like a leader
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.840]  we need to call all the governors organize it start the beta test that's what'll launch the

[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:22.560]  this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor formulated fountain of youth drink
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:27.440]  called patriot power greens patriot power greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:32.320]  that it's made their achy joints stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past previously
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:37.200]  this drink was only available to elite military units but for a limited time the creator of
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:41.840]  patriot power greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:46.720]  conservative friends all they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping to claim
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:54:13.040]  your free samples of patriot power greens go to green 75.com that's green 75.com greens 75.com
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:16.960]  one of the clinton victims has gone public and says she fears for her life that stories up on
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:24.240]  info wars.com and drudge report.com i'll talk some about that coming up in the next hour when
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:29.040]  max keiser joins us and more will also be looking at the world economy george soros is running around
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:34.960]  saying it's all going to collapse while openly standing to profit from it and i agree it's all
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:39.840]  untenable and go in that direction but then you know he ghoulishly shows up to then you try to sit
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:45.360]  in the middle of it manipulate it uh just more bizarre behavior uh but right now we've got mr
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:53.040]  steele with us we're taking phone calls here uh let's go ahead and talk to jt in colorata jt
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:55:03.760]  are on the air thanks for calling hi guys um mr steele uh might i suggest rather than a constitutional
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:13.440]  convention since uh the problem is the federal government not the constitution i would suggest
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:26.000]  a continental congress where the states elect delegates to uh tasked with the uh uh the idea
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:33.280]  of firing the federal government and its tentacles within the state what is your uh what is your
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:39.360]  opinion of that well first off we're talking about a virtual constitutional convention and
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:46.560]  whatever you want to call it it's a complete review of the constitution in my understanding and i
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:52.800]  have published a number of summaries of books about secession and state rights and one of the
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:58.160]  good things about ted cruz is he's got one of the strongest positions on state rights the federal
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:03.360]  government is supposed to be an administrative service of common concern i don't believe the federal
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:08.800]  government should own land it should also not be allowed to tax citizens or corporations it's
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:16.240]  gone imperial it's gone rogue and what we're saying is a bully pulpit event to debate a concon and to
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:21.680]  give it attention and to get support and to drive it and then to create a consensus on what the real
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:27.760]  concon will be and the plan to drive it through jt go ahead david yes and also to lay out the issues
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:32.800]  because one of the problems that i have with all of the candidates without exceptions is not a single
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:39.520]  one of them is providing a serious menu of what's wrong with the federal government and how to fix
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:46.880]  it they are all talking platitudes in isolated little bits and pieces uh i think kaseach because
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:52.480]  he really does understand what a balanced budget means is the most serious of them all but by and
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:58.560]  large tom freedman has it right when he says none of the above i want to see a concon in which the
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:04.880]  public defines what the gold standard is and then we challenge these candidates to rise to that standard
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:10.160]  or we find a new candidate all right jt interesting point on the constitutional convention uh instead
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:16.880]  of continental congress uh let's go ahead now and talk to jerry in new york you're on the air jerry
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:25.040]  thanks for calling good afternoon gentlemen uh mr steel i just was reading an article in the new
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:32.160]  york times um about mexico as frustrations with mexico's government rise so to lynchings it appears
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:38.480]  that um you know the mexican citizens are absolutely fed up with the government corruption
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:45.040]  i don't know what implications this is also because of the the corruption in the drug cartels and the
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:51.520]  banking without the drug wandering that you're gonna we may see this grow i don't know if you
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:57.760]  have any intelligence yes mexico has collapsed in many areas and is a totally failed state uh let's
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:03.360]  let's get steels take on that it's a great question jerry yeah it is and jerry i'm a son of new york
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:09.920]  i was born on on long island which may one day be the free state of long island um and i do believe
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:14.960]  that the united states is in a state a precondition of revolutionary state the most popular graphic
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:21.440]  on my website is preconditions of revolution that exist in the usa today there are going to be more
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:26.720]  cop killings there are going to be more people who lose their minds and start shooting you know
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:30.400]  i want to hold jerry over stay there we're gonna take a few more calls this is a great point and
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:35.040]  again i'm not saying the police are perfect folks you can't just execute random cops they want to
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:39.600]  make the revolution about that instead of going after the real elites i mean they're gonna get

[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:31.760]  and rockefeller funded i mean wow i wish we could keep our guests these are great questions
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:38.240]  but we'll have him back up soon i'm not sitting here blank check worshiping the police i'm the
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:42.640]  guy that wrote books on the police state but that's a process of government to bring in a tyranny
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:49.120]  that's our fault letting it get to this point but clearly they're trying to have the revolution
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:55.760]  against tyranny vent against the police clearly in mainstream media they're setting police up like
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:02.000]  a pinata uh in my view as the scapegoat and which it won't bring reform it'll turn them into death
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  squads will be their response to being killed in my view historically mr steele is that an
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.520]  accurate statement it is alex and i'm doing a briefing later this week on isis as a false
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:16.640]  threat and saudi arabia is the real threat and one of the questions i was asked to answer was
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:21.120]  is there a legitimate competitor to isis and the answer is yes there is it's called legitimate
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:27.760]  governance when wealth is concentrated and governance is out of control over regulation
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:34.960]  over taxation over or under benefits selective selective enforcement's the big one yes and so
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:40.960]  what you have here is you have a population it's like rats being packed into an aquarium
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:47.920]  people eventually start losing their minds good people start losing their minds and cops because
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:54.320]  they're uniforms they're the easiest most visible target for angry people who have lost their minds
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:02:00.560]  the united states is not far behind mexico yeah police especially just either ought to quit their
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:05.440]  jobs or help take the government back because i mean the globalist are willfully trying to make
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:10.960]  you the target it's a really bold move i gotta say of the establishment i think it's backfired
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:15.280]  because i talked to the police and military they see through it mr steve alex i want to make a
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:21.440]  point here which is governor abbott has less than 30 days to get his act together if he does not
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:27.520]  sponsor these events in march we will lose the election cycle no i get it we need to push that
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:30.800]  and let's try to develop a plan to try to get him to do it or get some other governor to do it i
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:38.160]  hear you uh jerry final comment to what we were just talking about uh yes um no final comment i i had
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:42.960]  one quick question i think it's important i have to go pick up my daughter from school
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:50.320]  i'm a retired police officer and former moraine uh infusion so i mr steve uh uh so i have that
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:57.600]  the question it's been mowing around is this issue of guaranteed minimum income it sounds like
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:06.640]  you know pine the sky and i was good it's a good idea jerry it's a good idea uh and let me just
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:13.760]  tell you i i'm from new york and i i have new york values and i also have colorado values um look
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:19.200]  what it boils down to is there is plenty of wealth one of the problems that we've had is we've tried
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:25.440]  to kill subsistence farming subsistence everything in florida it's illegal to harvest water and be
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.000]  off the grid the government trying to put us all in a big plastic box they're trying to make us pour
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.960]  on purpose and then they make it about you know oh you're not having a high enough wage when we
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:39.920]  had an economy that would stabilize and everybody could be wealthy when it came to having their basic
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:45.360]  subsistence we got a job thank you jerry yeah my bottom line jerry is that land needs to be
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:50.800]  owned by the community nobody should lack for food and shelter and clothing and education
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:57.840]  and that is easy to do if you restore integrity to the government they want us crammed into big
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:03.520]  mega cities running from them barely living hand to mouth in a 200 square foot coffin apartment
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:08.880]  with the federal government having 60 percent of land in the country that needs to end it needs to
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:13.280]  you know boom towns need to be created mining needs to be brought back this country is almost
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:20.000]  completely untouched now is the time and imagine another and other frontier in which we start creating
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:25.760]  marijuana plantations just like this colorado town just did which is going to make everybody in
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:32.240]  that town that was that was unemployed and without a penny rich uh well there are just hundreds of
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:36.800]  new industries and all sorts of innovations that have been blocked that will take us to the stars

[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:37.280]  nineties uh it made a quick billion dollars and he is a force to be reckoned with but the currency
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:44.080]  wars are hot they're getting hotter and these uh volatility in the currency wars are absolutely
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:49.520]  getting outrageous and funny enough uh bitcoin i don't want to talk about bitcoin right now but
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:56.080]  just that it's one of the least volatile currencies when you compare it to uh uh you know the ruble
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:02.080]  and the brazilian real and the south african ran who all these currencies alex by the way they're all
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:10.960]  making new all-time highs against gold so gold is now once again becoming a huge factor uh as as
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:16.640]  really the go-to currency we're going to we're going to get into this uh here um with the amazing
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:21.200]  shots you're showing us as you walk towards what is that the old imperial palace what's the thing
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:27.520]  that looks like it's a st basils cathedral yeah it looks like a martian moon base has landed um
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:32.000]  by or it looks like an alien spaceship this is kind of like the uh main symbol of russia you know
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.320]  in america we might have the grand canyon or mount rushmore this is kind of the the main
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:40.720]  symbol of russia right here in in red square and it's quite beautiful and when you're right here
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:45.600]  it's stunning well i appreciate you marching towards us so we can see that uh and the other
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:51.360]  time it's a nostril cam but this is amazing max let's get into george soros uh finally biting off
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:55.520]  more than he could chew trying to manipulate the chinese into a crash which he's been running around
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:00.000]  like this shot better alexis not the nostril cam how about this better i'm just having some humor
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:11.600]  you're awesome yes sir please continue with george soros yeah well soros you know he's he's a an old
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:18.080]  currency war veteran he's of course uh getting attacking china but china is a really bad uh case
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:24.400]  right now their economy was built on 17 trillion dollars or so of debt and now it's all imploding
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:30.480]  and this of course is driving up demand for oil oil is collapsing and uh here's a remarkable thing
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:37.520]  that just happened today is is that the uh the the bank the bankers have come out deuter bank
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:44.320]  has come out and begged the european central bank not to engage in any more quantitative easing
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:49.120]  because they feel that this would only strengthen the dollar and that would make oil even weaker
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:55.760]  and that would send the global economy into even deeper uh to depressionary deflationary
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:17:01.040]  funk so now you have a bank who's telling the central bank of europe the european central bank
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:06.240]  stop printing money stop quantitative easing you're killing the global economy so this is a
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:10.800]  remarkable turnaround because for seven years all they did was print money to bail out the bankers
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:15.120]  now even the bankers they get out the free money are begging them stop it you're you're destroying
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:20.960]  the global economy but if they do raise interest rates as they're starting to do that also puts
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:25.680]  things into a cardiac arrest you've been pretty accurate so far uh your predictions were a little
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:30.880]  bit early but they've come true what's the next shoe to drop uh as we uh talk to you as you march
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:37.440]  towards the symbol of russia they're in red square well it's the more you know it's a continuation
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:45.760]  of more of the same uh that the there's no ability to create enough growth to pay down any significant
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:54.640]  amount of debt and therefore the debt implosion the the the cyclone of debt is only getting worse
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:18:01.600]  and it's pulling economies down and we're starting to see volatility and markets are down china was
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:07.600]  down another six percent china markets down something almost 50 percent from the highs alex that's a huge
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:13.680]  drop down we're seeing a lot of the the stress in the high end real estate market we're seeing the
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:19.680]  top end of the real estate market now starting to collapse so this is the post 2008 collapse
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:25.920]  i that i predicted what happened two years ago i was early it's happening now i don't think i was
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:30.960]  but it is happening the way you pretty much predicted it which is a very very uh hard to do i
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:34.480]  mean it's easy to say things are untenable it's going to have some kind of class but you did
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:41.040]  call you know predict how it would start unraveling uh very very nicely well it's better to be a
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:45.440]  uh a little early than than too late because that's true you don't if you don't prepare yourself in
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:49.040]  time it's going to be too late in the case of gold for example if you don't have yourself
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:54.000]  positioned to buy gold you're going to be out of luck but so it's better to be early in this case
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.440]  and all the forces that are coming together i mean most of the guests on your show have been
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:02.480]  talking about this it's only on CNBC and these other outlets that they try to do a cheerleader
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:06.480]  for markets even though it's highly destructive but here in russia it's a very interesting story
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:11.600]  because the ruble has collapsed but it's turned the local economy around because people are now
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:17.760]  turning inward and they're growing their own food now and they're exploring their domestic
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:24.320]  economy in new ways and actually even though you have a fall in the oil price uh in dollar terms
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:29.360]  it has not fallen as much in ruble terms so the ruble has actually gained purchasing power
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:34.880]  during this recent collapse max stay there the the it's crystal clear now and hopefully during
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:38.640]  the break of if stacy can do it i mean take a break if you need to kind of pan around and show
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:43.120]  us this incredible it's like hd now earlier it was a little bit pixelated we're going to come back

[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:23.680]  red square in the capital of russia moscow it's about 10 30 p.m done a beautiful evening here
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:29.440]  and uh yeah we're in red square and it's all happening right here alex says you know we came
[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:34.400]  to you live from cairo we came to you live from athens and now we're coming to you live from
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:41.280]  moscow have you seen all the uh crazy propaganda coming out of the united kingdom against russia
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:50.080]  lately and uh bladimir putin about this uh disgraced spy lit venenko who uh of course
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:58.560]  found himself uh murdered by polonium 210 poisoning and this uh rented dredge in the
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:06.320]  uk decided that uh it all it all has to do with uh with putin and this is the absolute
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:12.880]  pinnacle of hypocrisy alex because here you have a government the united kingdom who if you recall
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:20.480]  going back to the 70s were murdering dozens of their own countrymen in belfast uh human rights
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:26.240]  lawyers and their associates getting slaughtered murdered by the uk government or let's go back
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:32.000]  to margaret sashers day her entire front bench was caught in a pedophile scandal
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:39.040]  raping children and murdering them she knew it and used that information to rule as a dictator
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:45.440]  in the united kingdom to put forth uh policies that were the same as social cleansing in the
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:50.960]  uk that's margaret thatcher now we've got david cameron and his austerity measures people are
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:57.440]  killing themselves because of cameron's austerity well let's expand on that we we just had the head
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:04.960]  uh of of all russia's intelligence die mysteriously there's clearly warfare going on
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:10.240]  soros is trying to overthrow and others russia publicly they're they're blowing up power plants
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:16.000]  in in uh ukraine i mean war crimes and i'm not even defending russia here but it's so obvious
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:21.360]  that the west is starting a war and then 10 years after the spy dies who our sources say was really
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:25.600]  a double agent in the west probably took him out they're saying putin's a murderer to try to bring
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:32.320]  in new sanctions what are they hoping to do pushes approval rating up even more well they're they're
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:40.080]  trying to uh i you know discredit uh putin because of course he's the only one in syria that is
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:46.560]  restoring any kind of order at all he's making everyone look horrible and so that this is some
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:52.720]  kind of uh attempt to discredit the only credible statesman out there today who's doing things in
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:57.360]  the middle east that the u.s. have been trying to do for years and have failed miserably to do
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:01.600]  and i think i think they feel embarrassed by the presence of somebody who's actually getting stuff
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:09.200]  done and so they're trying to discredit him but this is a huge propaganda war and the uh the the
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:16.320]  ability for the u.s. to to to engage in this is is failing i mean rt where i do my show is growing
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:21.920]  by leaps and bounds and schultz it's just got a new show in rt america you know people are coming
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:27.440]  over because they realize that rt is the last bastion of a free independent well you got learning
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:32.000]  on there and you know he's put he's put down americana stuff he's not like saluting the booty
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:40.400]  no we so so the the media tables are turning and the u.s. the bbc is a shameless uh propaganda
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:44.160]  hey why do you think algezero just went down i tell you talk about put down party line i mean
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:48.400]  i know you worked there previously but boy uh why is algezero america shutting down your view
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:54.320]  they tried to uh toe the line they were much too conservative and they nobody wanted to watch them
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:28:00.160]  we told them that they needed to be uh more like fox news and less like the bbc but they just
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:04.880]  algezero wanted to be accepted so they didn't do anything controversial whatsoever they were
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:10.320]  very plain vanilla like watching walter kronkine 1965 yeah exactly you're actually on the big rt
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:15.520]  which is in hotel rooms all over the world it's in all of europe it's on broadcast tv in europe
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:20.720]  for folks that don't know rt's now much bigger than cnn and all of their western media because
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:24.640]  people think it's more accurate and i don't think it's perfect i've seen some pro russian
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:28.960]  propaganda that's a little slanted but most of it's pretty darn accurate compared to our media
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:35.680]  what a revolutionary thought well yeah i mean that they we were here for the 10-year anniversary
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:41.280]  a couple of weeks ago and uh jesse ventura was here and a lot of folks were here and uh
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:46.320]  vladimir putin gave a speech and basically just said look my job is to sit in the kremlin and
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:50.960]  govern the country your job is to do television news you do what you have to do and you know
[02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:56.640]  i'll do what i gotta do we there's no there's no path stone cross and we have absolute freedom
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:00.320]  that's why you know i'll tell you something right now that most mainstream media won't tell you
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:06.400]  that deuter bank in germany is the next leman brothers okay look at the stock price it's down
[02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:12.480]  remarkably it looks like a absolute cascading you know rocket about the hit planet earth and an

[02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:38.160]  to i mean there's so much going on before we get into the economy leeman brothers part two all that
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:41.520]  with you max i want to hit some of the other stuff and then and then after we cover that take
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:50.000]  some calls what do you make of what's happened with hillary what's happening with trump do you
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.720]  think clinton's rapes and settling rapes and women coming out saying they fear for their lives
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:58.960]  we'll put drudgereport.com on screen and show folks they can click through and read that article
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:06.240]  at info wars.com i mean is there anything that can unseat hillary rottem clinton and and out of
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:11.680]  all the players uh you know bernie sanders talks about inequity but doesn't tell people why it's
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:17.920]  crony capitalism uh we you know hillary we knows the consulate insider saying she's not uh you know
[02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:22.400]  what do you think of ted cruise what do you think of donald trump what's your take on election 2016
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:30.560]  from red square well alex you know we entered really a vortex a few weeks ago the event horizon
[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:37.760]  was crossed when donald trump was on alex jones and what i mean by that is he's been in the trenches
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:42.080]  for years developing this audience of an alternative media with an alternative voice and here's a
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:46.960]  presidential candidate who realizes that mainstream media is a complete waste of time and he goes on
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:53.040]  the alex jones show now bernie sanders on the other side of the aisle also realizes that he can
[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:58.880]  reach out with you know a man with an audience of of alternative media as well and he gets
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:03.760]  enormous traction but this is a presidential election we're going to sweep out all the old
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:09.760]  and we're bringing in the new i think hillary clinton is toast and i think that donald trump
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:14.000]  is going to be the republican nominee 64 now republicans think that trump's going to be the
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:20.080]  nominee personally i'd like to see trump get in the white house because i think he would be the
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:25.600]  right billionaire at the right time to kick out the other billionaires remember vladimir
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:30.880]  putin had to kick out the kleptocrats when he came into office in the early 90s and the russian
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:37.360]  economy benefited as a result putin is anti kleptocrat he's anti oligarch same thing with
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:43.360]  trump if trump gets in he will kick out the other oligarchs the michael bloomberg the billionaires
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:48.720]  that that are ruling and destroying america the coke brother he'll get rid of them that's my
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:54.000]  and by the way he said he likes putin and what he's done kicking out the cronies and so i don't
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.400]  usually say man on a white horse you know i want some guy a strong man to save me we're already
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:03.440]  having him try to give people martial law and no one cares i mean we've reached such a crisis
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:08.640]  point that we know jeb bush and hillary ain't it i mean you know there's no way trump could possibly
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:12.800]  be and you know i don't want to say behind the scenes stuff but trump claims he's aware of
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:20.080]  almost everything basically look we had in america the robber barons who were anxious to destroy america
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:26.960]  and teddie roosevelt assumed the white house and he destroyed he became the trust buster and he
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:34.240]  swept out the plutocrats the sherman anti trust act of 1906 and he broke up the oil company standard
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:40.640]  oil etc he was a lot of people in his class thought he portrayed his class because he was a rich guy
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:45.440]  the roosevelt family very rich fifth avenue family but he assumed power and he kicked out the oligarchs
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:49.280]  the robber barons as they were called and that's what america needed that's what i thought obama
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:53.600]  was going to do when he when he came into office i thought he was going to you know throw down and
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:58.560]  get rid of a lot of these crony capital i wouldn't even care i mean i'd care less if we had some
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:02.960]  robber barons that actually wanted to hire people like henry ford and actually said i paid people
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:08.720]  so they can buy a car i mean it's it's like these are anti free market i mean look at obama going
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:13.040]  to africa saying you can't have cars you can't have air conditioning why not say we're going to
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:18.080]  develop clean cars and air conditioning i mean i mean just to say it from air force one on a red
[02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:27.120]  carpet well what we have in this century is the billionaire class that uses financial products
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:31.920]  and financialization so it's different than henry ford who manufactured cars and there's
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:36.720]  something tangible about that and there was a manufacturing base but here you have billionaires
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:41.920]  that have gotten their billions through flipping paper through stocks and bonds and
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:46.560]  financialization and derivatives and that adds absolutely nothing to the economy and they're
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:52.320]  entrenched in the system along with the central bank but as i said earlier it's remarkable that
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:59.360]  deuter bank and other bankers are begging mario drage at the european central bank to stop printing
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:04.560]  money because he's doing more harm than good i've been saying on your show for several years now
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:11.680]  that printing money causes deflation it doesn't fight deflation now deuter bank and other bankers
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:16.000]  are agreeing with what i've been saying on your show for years that all the money printing all it
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:22.400]  does it supports the zombie banks who use all the free money to just roll over all of the debt
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:27.040]  that's no good it's junk debt it should they should be allowed to fail if in fact this was a free
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:32.320]  market but by keeping them propped up with all the money printing they are a huge impediment
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:38.400]  for economic growth and now even the bankers themselves realize that they don't want the
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:42.160]  free money anymore it's just killing the economy sure what are the next triggers and then i want
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:46.800]  to get into some hardcore news and take calls what in your view the next triggers are the in
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:51.920]  the oil market what's remarkable is that if you look at the price of oil it's gone down but the
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:57.760]  transportation index which is an index of stocks tied to transportation it's also gone down but
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:03.200]  usually if the price of oil goes down transportation companies go up or people benefit from a lower
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:10.160]  gas price but now we're seeing lower oil prices trigger a financial collapse because all the oil
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:16.880]  is backed by junk bonds and those junk bonds are now all deflating in value they're all crashing
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:22.320]  so the actual the lower oil price is not helping the economy let's go further let's go further as
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:27.520]  the old companies got caught by the ap in 2000 on a six-year plan that went back to 94 the big 10
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:33.680]  kept meeting in new york and in other u.s cities in their lawsuit they got the documents shang we're
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:38.720]  going to have wallcatters in the future they predicted the shale market coming up the tar sands
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:43.920]  they said we've got to get fake environmentalists to that that we fund to shut down this is in the
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:49.760]  documents to shut down all these new refineries and don't let new ones get opened so even if the
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:56.160]  Saudis or somebody have a war and they saw this you know 17 18 years ago and lower prices we will
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:41:02.320]  create an artificial bottleneck so gas should be like a dollar a gallon now that would actually
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:06.720]  help the economy it hurts a bunch of other areas of the economy to have oil that low but it should
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:13.840]  be translating like a dollar 10 okay or a dollar 20 no it's not it's still so we're getting both
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:18.320]  oil's really plunging in the real market but by the time we get it it's so rigged we're still
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:22.800]  paying way more than we should because the oil companies have the refineries and and so it doesn't
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:27.840]  matter if there's a glut they've suspended reality yet again guys are a double screw job two points
[02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:34.800]  two points number one you made there in terms of the gas price uh but the important thing to
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:42.560]  remember is that behind this industry it is a structured financial market of bonds that that
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:49.680]  are all now unable to pay their interest payments and they they're all collapsing so this is this is
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:54.880]  causing a chain reaction and all these other loans to the wildcatters are going to bank
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:42:01.120]  Deutsche bank is a huge lender to the oil business and that's why it's going down now you mentioned
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:07.040]  the the shale industry for a second the shale industry in america was not even profitable
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:14.240]  when oil was $80 a barrel the whole shale so-called revolution was a hoax because the life of an
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:22.160]  average shale project is not does not last long enough to pay the debt that you that the that
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:28.800]  you need was an investor hoax it is a hoax it there's always cash flow negative from day one
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:34.640]  and that's what oil was $80 a barrel now the oil at $30 a barrel not only are you getting a negative
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:39.680]  cash flow on all the shale rigs in america but all the junk bonds and now all the banks that lent
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:44.800]  like a Deutsche bank or all these money center banks that lent into this hoax they're now collapsing
[02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:51.360]  so it doesn't matter if gas price goes to 20 cents a gallon if if in fact the credit market
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:56.720]  sees up completely like a 2008 which which is that now going to happen again that that's the
[02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:01.840]  least of your worry is that you you're gonna you know pay the property tax market goes belly up
[02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:06.160]  because they're not getting all that oil and gas money it is because it'll bring in capital controls
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:12.240]  bail ins bank seizures money seizures so so what so why you bank 50 cents a gallon if the bank just
[02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:16.960]  just took all the money out of your account like they did in Cyprus you know it doesn't matter and
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:21.280]  so you're saying that's coming all your money that brings me to the next point we play this video
[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:25.040]  twice i'm not going to play it again right now we'll play it next hour or whatever night's in
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:31.200]  but video senator warren's authorization he's military force bill his declaration of international
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:36.080]  martial law and it's mitch mcconnell the republicans are handing obama and the next president
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:44.320]  what even connecticut senator chris murphy calls a declaration of international martial law the
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:49.040]  resolution is a total rewrite of the war powers clause of the constitution we have ron paul
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:53.920]  saying the same thing we said this last week uh he said this last week i didn't even know he said
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:44:00.480]  it till last night no coverage max keiser that's two big stories the biggest war powers act bigger
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:06.480]  in world war two unlimited insane and it's not even in the news i hope you cover it on your
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:11.760]  big rt show i hope this gets out this should be big news for the russians right here with nato
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:18.960]  knocking on your door well yeah nato is is the aggressor and you know part of the problem is that
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:25.200]  victoria newland her husband is a lobbyist from monsanto monsanto the genetically modified seeds
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:30.960]  they want to get into ukraine bladamere putin who works right over there in the kremlin has said
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:35.600]  that he doesn't want genetically modified seeds anywhere near russia uh he thinks that it's a
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:41.040]  disaster he wants to be the global leader in organic food that's what he says so so that's part
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:46.080]  of the whole ukraine situation is that victoria newland who famously got caught talking on the
[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:50.480]  phone organizing a coup in the ukraine her husband and works from monsanto basically
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:58.960]  and so that is causing this huge tension and and the nato uh is really the aggressor in all of this
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:04.160]  and if you look at the why the story you mentioned before war powers act etc the news is not being
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:09.120]  covered if you look if you look at this you know i'm a little older than you alex so i don't know
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:15.200]  you know you probably you know i was alive during the 1960s during the vietnam war and you know they
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:22.560]  used to see the bodies on the news come back from war you used to see uh shots from uh the actual
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:28.160]  front line now walter grogite said we had a right to see it right and then one of the lessons that
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:33.280]  was learned on that war is never show the consequences of war anymore don't show the bodies don't
[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:39.040]  show the coffins and it's very rarely do we see that anymore uh because it's become sanitized
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:44.480]  americans don't understand that if they organize bombs dropping all over the middle east
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:51.040]  in afghanistan iraq syria and a million or two million migrants show up on european doorstep
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:56.000]  because of their actions that a lot of people are going to not like america and the united kingdom
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:01.440]  for bombing those people to causing that migration crisis and that has a ripple effect and this is
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:06.240]  where a country is like russia are stepping in and saying look let's be adults about this let's
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:13.760]  offer some uh conversation some diplomacy and uh he's hated for it sure will there be a walter grogite
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:19.760]  moment in america where even the elite see the images of children running burned by napalm
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:25.600]  and say has the war been lost is it time to stop this i mean is there some point where people
[02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:31.280]  finally go enough is enough uh but you said it we're not seeing those images other than shows
[02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:36.320]  like mine and yours and you know the drudge reporter whatever and so uh but but there is a
[02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:41.040]  shift happening where we now in many cases have more listeners and viewers than you know seeing
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:45.440]  in an msnbc combined i mean i hate to say that it's kind of a weird thought that we have 28 million
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:49.520]  viewers and listeners that come through every week one way or another uh you have tens of millions
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:54.320]  as well i mean max my god you're on on every continent on broadcast tv and cable uh i mean
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:58.640]  that's got to shake up the system i know they're trying to shut down rt congress and the state
[02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:04.560]  department and hillary have been calling to ban your show in the united states right they uh
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:10.160]  they try to shut down rt they shut down press tv in the uk they took them off the satellite but
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:14.880]  you ask what's that moment that's going to trigger a kind of a vietnam remember in the vietnam war
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:20.640]  you had the ken stage shooting which was uh galvanized the youth movement and really it was a turning
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:26.160]  point in the anti-war uh protest of that era i think what's going on in flint michigan right now
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:30.320]  has the potential to galvanize this generation to understand that their government is trying to kill
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:35.920]  them flint michigan is a third world hellhole where people are dying because of the local
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:41.280]  politicians taking huge bribes from other industrialist and kleptocrats and they don't care
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:49.280]  at all about the local population they're killing people i mean michael uh more who okay is not well
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:57.040]  liked by many folks who think he's uh too liberal or what have you but he's been documenting flint
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:03.280]  michigan for many many years and um he's right there on the scene and he's providing those images
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:06.960]  that we're talking about and providing good journalism sure well we i mean our journalists
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:12.080]  have been there we have the hd drive footage we talked to the locals leon macadoo and mr zimmerman
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:16.800]  just got back uh just a few days ago and they said it's over the top the point is it's the
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:23.200]  infrastructure falling apart it's nafta it's gat it's globalism is the reason that's all imploding
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:30.560]  and my problem is a michael more or a uh bernie sanders sell this pie in the sky stuff that'll
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:36.320]  fix it when the problems crony capitalism and globalism not capitalism capitalism produces
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:40.640]  the best water treatment plants the best civilizations their scapegoating capitalism and
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:47.360]  that's my problem i agree i i i would agree with that point uh but and and also to your point you
[02:48:47.360 --> 02:48:53.200]  did have uh reporters on the ground and flint but my the the the infrastructure as we're saying in
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:49:00.320]  these towns in these cities is really collapsing and the results are are really sickening to many
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:06.560]  people and i think that might be a kind of call the arms moment where the population of america
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:10.880]  i agree that's what they're on town that's what began to bring down the old soviet union with
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:15.200]  stuff like chernobyl blowing up and and and you know we see more and more of our reactors leaking
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:19.040]  they just cover it up so i think more and more in the west we're going to have chernobyl moments
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:21.680]  and there's just going to be a certain point when our kids are down around us that we're just
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:26.160]  going to be done with the central government that's red carpets and you know all it's bull
[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:30.320]  about the oscars and all this other diversion we're sick of the oscars we're sick of it all
[02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:35.680]  we're sick of obama we're sick of the republicans we're sick of you people uh let's go ahead let's
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:40.400]  go ahead take a call from george in canada kit you're on the year with max keiser by the way
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:46.080]  again your senator is saying we're going under martial law go ahead yeah i'm i'm glad he's saying
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:50.480]  something positive lately anyway i'm taking a call i'm wondering what's the what's the best
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:55.440]  place to uh i have an ira but the problem is where the heck do you put your investment into
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:50:01.440]  what's safe i thought gold something like uh peter shifts the idea of putting it into a solid gold
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:06.400]  not not just the paper because the paper is so manipulated or are there any other recommendations
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:12.640]  you can possibly make yeah max what are you doing well like gerald celente says uh i i don't give
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:20.720]  personal financial advice and as celente says he buys gold for his golden years and gold is of
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:25.680]  course making new all-time highs and many currencies around the world it's the dollar it's not made a
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:30.960]  new all-time high against a dollar yet but i think it will and it i've been saying on your show for
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:36.000]  years i mean this is the only that this is the last man standing kaiser let me let me get hard on
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.200]  this point i appreciate your call george great point and we're gonna callers i'm doing this
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:45.520]  breaker skipping it this is so important uh look i you know harvey dent or harry dent uh not the
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:50.080]  guy from batman but the uh former bayne turnaround expert yeah he's been accurate in a lot of
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:56.160]  predictions uh so his shift so have you but you guys have all differ on the future i know gold's
[02:50:56.160 --> 02:51:01.200]  real i know it's not just a commodity it's used as an industrial metal the chinese the indians others
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:05.840]  are buying it governments university of texas is buying it i know it's an emergency hedge if
[02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:10.160]  everything collapses people get what it is so it's silver and i'm and i'm indifisibly holding
[02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:14.080]  i've never sold any of it that i've got not the stuff i bought at 300 an ounce of the stuff i bought
[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:18.800]  it four hundred dollars an ounce i never bought once it went above that uh so so i'm comfortable
[02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:24.160]  you know in my decision because i i mean i know somewhere down the road five ten years it's it's
[02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:27.920]  going to go stratospheric because you can look at the bubbles you can look at you know won't just
[02:51:27.920 --> 02:51:32.880]  be deflation forever it'll be inflation in the currencies even if there's deflation in the real
[02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:37.680]  economy and depression but i mean you know so you and dent i both respect both of you're both really
[02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:43.360]  smart cookies he's saying it's it's going to be low for 10 years uh it's gone up a little bit but
[02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:49.040]  but overall he says it's going to be down for 10 years you say it's going back up uh so debate that
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:56.480]  right here sure look harry dent has been really good in terms of the last five years if he if he
[02:51:56.480 --> 02:52:00.640]  with all the people that he does mention he's probably got the hottest hand in terms of calling
[02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:06.400]  deflation where everyone else has really been saying inflation he was very good to say deflation
[02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:12.640]  all commodities have been deflating oils deflating and he includes gold in that basket but what i my
[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:18.640]  response would be look at gold outside of just the u.s dollar because if you look at it through other
[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:24.640]  currencies it's reacting very very well it's hitting new all-time highs number one so outside of the
[02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:31.120]  rigged economy it's doing well well and a global basis it's it's responding well and the second
[02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:38.160]  point i would make is that what one one aspect that mr dent does not get into that i think
[02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:43.920]  is worthy of consideration that would change the dynamic pretty dramatically is if a country like
[02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:52.240]  russia or china decides to partially back their currency with gold so gold is once again monetized
[02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:59.520]  then then it's really a different paradigm at that point and you'll see uh i think gold resume
[02:52:59.520 --> 02:53:04.240]  it's it's long-standing okay let's jump i want to go to more calls but a few other things you
[02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:10.320]  personally are doing i i'm just sticking to precious metals as i've said before i mean i i mean i i
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:16.240]  love bitcoin i think bitcoin is a huge value of reserve i had the bitcoin capital that we've raised
[02:53:16.240 --> 02:53:20.560]  since i was on your show last time we've raised over four hundred thousand dollars in the last
[02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:25.600]  few weeks since i was on your show for bitcoin capital so people are putting money into bitcoin
[02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:31.680]  they get a daily dividend in bitcoin and we're putting money to work in new emerging companies
[02:53:31.680 --> 02:53:38.800]  of bitcoin it's for qualified investors only and it's uh it's similar to gold and that it has
[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:44.640]  attributes like gold but it's obviously not for everybody it's a very special type of
[02:53:45.200 --> 02:53:52.240]  consideration but other than that um it's about uh you know my i listen to selente when he's on
[02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:57.360]  your show too i mean he's he's dead right you know get rid of your debt and prepare prepare for the
[02:53:57.360 --> 02:54:01.760]  worst all right fair enough max geyser we're going to play this little three-minute response for dent
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:06.560]  when he's on this thursday and and and then have a uh you know a serious discussion about this to
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:12.240]  really suss out uh for folks to make decisions let's go to some phone calls here again uh let's go
[02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:20.320]  ahead and talk to sherry in texas you're on the air go ahead sherry thank you alex listen
[02:54:20.320 --> 02:54:24.560]  everything you're saying mr. keiser i agree but i want to look at it for a second from
[02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:31.120]  a standpoint of socialism as i see it and the word fettered i hear fettered uh referred to
[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:38.480]  restricted and and and it suggests unfair treatment and fettered has been used to describe democratic
[02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:44.720]  socialism but if if we restrict banks that's not unfair you know if we restrict predatory
[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:48.880]  lending there's nothing unfair about that the better word is trampled and i want to just throw
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:54.800]  that in trampled is like throwing in that over a wild animal like like the federal reserve and i
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:55:01.520]  have a problem um the only dictator i can see is the federal reserve not bernie sanders
[02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:05.840]  i hear you i appreciate your call i get what you're saying we're all worried about a dictatorship
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:11.280]  we have the private federal reserve saying it's above the law on pbs and rules everything
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:16.480]  screwing us over and it's privately owned uh that's and we've been under it for 102 years max
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:22.000]  geyser if i understand the question it's kind of asking why would i why would i lean toward
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:27.040]  trump and not toward sanders is that a fair is that kind of the question sure she's just saying
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:33.040]  we're already under a dictatorship so why not just get a different flavor of it well um well
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:38.240]  i it's tough to unpack what what the caller was saying there you talk about socialism and what
[02:55:38.240 --> 02:55:41.920]  on a fettered or unfettered i mean can you break it down for me what that question was
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:48.720]  specifically i think she's saying we're already under reform of socialism i call it fascism
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:53.360]  um yeah okay well um yeah i i if the question is
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:58.720]  are we the central banks have an enormous amount of
[02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:04.800]  centralized power and this is not good and it's causing a lot of damage the point
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:09.200]  where the banks themselves are trying to dismantle these uh bankers because they're causing
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:14.560]  this this there's disruption that this deflation so sure i'm gonna go to tyrone in a minute but
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:18.720]  i want to go to john real quick just to talk about it uh they they are saying the new x-files characters
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:23.280]  mainly based on me but the material they cover is going to be based on info or stories like human
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:28.000]  animal hybrids which is admitted in the news but it doesn't get a lot of traction then it's in a
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:35.040]  fiction movie uh so let's get john's take on that john and michigan go ahead hi alex yeah i just
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:40.080]  think it's really dangerous that they're going to fictionalize all these facts you know and people
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:43.600]  are going to watch x-files and then they're going to someone we're going to hear someone talking about
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:47.120]  something and be like oh yeah i saw that our next file it's just like people are like oh yeah i saw
[02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:52.480]  that in a movie oh yeah i saw that on youtube it can't be real that's a great point what do you
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:57.120]  think's behind chris carter coming out saying i like alex jones i think world governments are real
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:57:02.080]  threat i don't think he's right wing he's libertarian i like him you know i have it we've exchanged
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:05.920]  emails he admires me i don't know when we're gonna hook up talk soon but i mean what do you think
[02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:09.680]  that sounds like max keiser that's one of the biggest tv shows in us history what does that
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:16.320]  signify it signifies that you're winning you know i mean that could be one of the what one of the
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:23.200]  choices here could be that the message that you you put forward is is now become uh
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:29.760]  the un unarguable it's that's people are starting to understand it you're winning that's that's the
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:39.040]  point of it all but we're winning brother yeah i mean this is the the the system you know what i've
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:46.080]  said all along for people who watch your show and they say that guy sounds a bit you know like he's
[02:57:46.080 --> 02:57:54.240]  he's he's not you know i say wait six months because the stuff he's saying today six months from now
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:57:58.640]  will be part of the mainstream news cycle you have to listen to your show for at least six months
[02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:03.360]  before you can say anything about it listen to alex jones for six months and then you'll understand
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:07.360]  what a million two people around the world understand is that what you're saying today
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:12.720]  doesn't sound like it fits today but it doesn't six months wow what a plug do five more minutes
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:16.800]  with us i know you're freezing your butt off at almost i'm starting to get cold i love it five more
[02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:21.040]  minutes i want to come back if we have callers like tyrone wants to talk bitcoin with you
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:25.280]  and and supreme court justice and more thank you john from michigan you know i think it's a mixed
[02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:29.840]  bag the sex file thing but but it does signify that they can't ignore the zeitgeist back in 70

[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:41.200]  gonna take a call well this is the year that things are unraveling so yeah i was two years too early
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:45.520]  but i'd rather be two years too early than a one day too late yeah but things were already collapsing
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:50.160]  around the world before that just that the now the the the the the the the the the the the the
[03:01:50.160 --> 03:01:56.800]  solutions of 2009 to print 15 to 20 trillion dollars i've been saying now for seven years
[03:01:57.360 --> 03:02:01.920]  was not going to work as many people have it would it would create another huge collapse
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:06.800]  and i thought would that collapse would have started by now now it's starting so um that's
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:11.680]  that's the point the point is that all the solutions never worked we never got the ggp growth
[03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:19.200]  it was harry dent like uh deflation yes that's right uh but i still am very positive on gold
[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:23.200]  for the reasons that i have suggested but they're out of bullets with weird screwy manipulations
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:27.520]  they're starting to run out of bullets they're completely out of bullets except for maybe one
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:33.040]  where they should shoot themselves on the head just to be official you pretty much are endorsing

[03:08:17.200 --> 03:08:25.360]  jones show welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host for this fourth hour
[03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:33.040]  january 26 2016 what i'm going to talk about today is the open betrayal of the constitution
[03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:39.360]  in terms of the fast tracking of the dissolution of congress now we've talked earlier today and alex
[03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:44.320]  has played it several times i'm going to play it again this authorization for the use of military
[03:08:44.320 --> 03:08:50.720]  force and the senator who last week as it was being introduced said this is a call for international
[03:08:50.720 --> 03:08:55.600]  martial law he said i understand that we need to move after isis i won't i support that goal as
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:09:02.560]  well but this is the wrong way to go about it it's a way to go about it that voids the constitution
[03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:06.560]  and it's not just that i've got a clip that i'm going to play before i play that clip
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:12.560]  on the same day another senator uh this is a democrat senator he by the way the guy who opposed
[03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:18.480]  that was a democrat senator from connecticut good for him good for him and it's very important when
[03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:24.000]  we see somebody who goes against their party leaders for principle for the constitution and
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:28.480]  i want to say that we need to strongly stand behind him on this on this particular issue it's not to
[03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:33.280]  say that we're going to give him a blank check on every particular issue and a blanket endorsement
[03:09:33.280 --> 03:09:38.000]  for him we don't ever do that with anybody understand that we pick people issue by issue and
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:43.200]  say i support him on this issue i don't support him over here and we need to uh criticize people
[03:09:43.200 --> 03:09:46.240]  when they do the wrong thing we need to pat them on the back when they do the right thing now here's
[03:09:46.240 --> 03:09:51.840]  a senator who does the wrong thing senator barbara mikulski she's been there forever in maryland
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:57.040]  and when they're talking about and this is again on wednesday the same day that mitch mcconnell is
[03:09:57.040 --> 03:10:03.440]  introducing this fast track authorization uh to do an international martial law to give the president
[03:10:03.440 --> 03:10:07.920]  carte blanche to go anywhere for as long as he wishes without any justification without any
[03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:13.280]  authorization from congress no time limit no constraints of any time geography or anything
[03:10:13.280 --> 03:10:20.080]  okay we're just creating a Caesar here we're crossing the rubicon on that same day that that is
[03:10:20.080 --> 03:10:28.560]  introduced we have barba mikulski say this about obama's executive orders mr chairman i look forward
[03:10:28.560 --> 03:10:33.760]  though not to me talking and listening to myself i'm listening to the attorney general i'm listening
[03:10:33.760 --> 03:10:39.520]  to this wonderful panel that you've invited to participate today so let's solve the problem
[03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:46.240]  let's not get involved in constitutional arguments and let's help our american people be safe and
[03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:52.240]  secure in their home their neighborhood their school and their house of worship let's not get
[03:10:52.240 --> 03:11:00.160]  involved in constitutional arguments and let's help our american people be safe and secure
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:02.960]  do you think you're going to be safe and secure if you don't have a constitution that protects
[03:11:02.960 --> 03:11:08.000]  your rights if you have no legal rights that are respected by the government the whole point
[03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:14.800]  of the constitution was to secure liberty for us that was the the fundamental purpose of the
[03:11:14.800 --> 03:11:18.560]  people who created this country you can see that the declaration of independence you can see it in
[03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:23.440]  the first 10 amendments to the constitution to clarify after they set up this document they said
[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:28.560]  you know maybe we haven't made it clear enough that the federal government is not going to be the
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:34.480]  ruler of us that we're giving it limited powers that we're reserving powers to ourselves so let's
[03:11:34.480 --> 03:11:40.960]  make that very clear and so they enumerate that and eight amendments specific things that they're
[03:11:40.960 --> 03:11:45.360]  protecting and laying that out and then they put in two more the ninth and the tenth to make it
[03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:51.120]  abundantly clear that if we haven't expressly given you this power then you don't have it but
[03:11:51.120 --> 03:11:57.360]  of course barbara mikulski says well you know let's not have a second involved in any constitutional
[03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:03.200]  arguments let's just make ourselves safe and secure that is the lie that they continually
[03:12:03.200 --> 03:12:10.480]  sell you as part of the national security state so now let's play on the same day this is a reaction
[03:12:10.480 --> 03:12:17.440]  to what was also introduced that same day by mitch mcconnell a republican who introduced this bill
[03:12:17.440 --> 03:12:23.600]  for international martial law and this is what the again a democrat senator opposed that let's
[03:12:23.600 --> 03:12:29.440]  hear what he had to say again speak very briefly about a resolution that the majority leader introduced
[03:12:29.440 --> 03:12:37.760]  i believe earlier today this is an authorization for military force is a total rewrite of the war
[03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:44.320]  powers clause of the united states constitution let's be clear about that it is essentially a
[03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:52.960]  declaration of international martial law a sweeping transfer of military power to the president that
[03:12:52.960 --> 03:13:00.320]  will allow him or her to send us troops almost anywhere in the world for almost any reason
[03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:07.680]  with absolutely no limitations it's safe to say that this resolution is the wrong way
[03:13:08.240 --> 03:13:15.280]  to authorize war against ISIS the language of this resolution is dangerous and it is unprecedented
[03:13:16.160 --> 03:13:21.920]  okay so he is making a very clear point ron paul made the same point if you take a look at the
[03:13:21.920 --> 03:13:27.200]  article that we have on this ron paul says uh and we quote him in the article where we cover that
[03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:31.600]  video that video is embedded you can see the entire speech if you go to info wars dot com
[03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:37.600]  where he says this resolution is a total rewrite rewrite of the war powers clause of the constitution
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:44.240]  let's be clear about that that's democrat senator chris murphy that is uh s j resolution 29 he says
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:48.720]  it is essentially a declaration of international martial law and of course what are they doing
[03:13:48.720 --> 03:13:54.640]  with it they are fast tracking it where we heard that before we've heard the word fast
[03:13:54.640 --> 03:14:01.280]  track used over and over again haven't wait if they can't do a document dump of a several thousand
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:06.880]  page bill and say we've only got 24 hours to do it we've got to pass this omnibus bill uh or the
[03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:11.280]  government is going to shut down there's no time to read this so we did it with obama care and we
[03:14:11.280 --> 03:14:16.960]  have done it repeatedly with bainer and the rest of these people dumping this out not giving anybody
[03:14:16.960 --> 03:14:20.640]  time to take a look at it and of course that's precisely what they're going to do with the
[03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:26.240]  trade deals that are going to be hitting the congress very shortly because this has been
[03:14:26.240 --> 03:14:30.400]  floating around they said we we finished this they did that back i think it was in december
[03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:34.560]  they said they had finished it and we're just waiting for that to be introduced and of course
[03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:40.240]  they have already said they're going to fast track this they are going to do the same thing in terms
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:46.800]  of the constitution ignoring it eviscerating it and this is congress doing it to itself imagine
[03:14:46.800 --> 03:14:51.920]  if we had a king george the third that dissolved the american legislature dissolved parliament or
[03:14:51.920 --> 03:14:58.320]  we had a czar who dissolved the the duke okay we got the congress who's doing it to themselves
[03:14:58.320 --> 03:15:03.840]  they're eviscerating their own powers they have passed all of their legislating powers their their
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:09.520]  power to tax their power to write laws they have passed that off to the bureaucracies they're proud
[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:17.040]  of that 81 000 pages of legislation passed by the bureaucracy just last year a new record but of
[03:15:17.040 --> 03:15:23.680]  course they've been hitting at about 79 000 80 000 pages of new rules and regulations each year
[03:15:23.680 --> 03:15:30.560]  draconian rules and regulations with no wiggle room without having to find you guilty of a crime
[03:15:30.560 --> 03:15:37.040]  they can impose excessive fines violating every one of the articles of the constitution we said
[03:15:37.040 --> 03:15:42.080]  we had a revolution in this country because we wanted did not want taxation without representation
[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:49.600]  well i don't want legislation and taxation without representation we have a swarm of officers who are
[03:15:49.600 --> 03:15:54.720]  harassing our people and eating out their substances that's how familiar that's the beginning of the
[03:15:54.720 --> 03:16:00.480]  declaration of independence that's what we have to stop so when we look at this fast track we've
[03:16:00.480 --> 03:16:08.560]  been sold this as a deal we've been told it's an agreement it's a partnership remember the NAFTA
[03:16:08.560 --> 03:16:15.520]  was a north american free trade agreement the tpp and the ttip are transatlantic and transpacific
[03:16:15.520 --> 03:16:20.160]  partnerships whenever they talk about them they love to talk about them being a deal but guess what
[03:16:20.160 --> 03:16:28.480]  they're treaties a treaty is an agreement between two or more countries that is about economics or
[03:16:28.480 --> 03:16:32.400]  other issues if you look it up in the dictionary the very first thing they say is about economics
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:36.240]  that's the very first definition they come up with so it was interesting yesterday
[03:16:36.240 --> 03:16:42.640]  when i saw this article in the drudge report linking to the canadian broadcasting corporation cbc
[03:16:42.640 --> 03:16:47.760]  and out of canada they say canada will sign the tpp trade deal february the fourth but
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:54.560]  ratification is not certain now this is the person who is the international trade representative
[03:16:54.560 --> 03:17:00.880]  of canada and she says signing does not equal ratifying signing is simply a technical step in
[03:17:00.880 --> 03:17:06.160]  the process allowing the tpp text to be tabled in the canadian parliament for consideration for
[03:17:06.160 --> 03:17:13.440]  debate before any final decision is made and they even say in the text of this cbc article but when
[03:17:13.440 --> 03:17:19.440]  it comes to ratification of the 12 country treaty the 12 country treaty this is a treaty how are
[03:17:19.440 --> 03:17:24.640]  treaties passed in the constitution you have to have two-thirds majority of the senate to pass a
[03:17:24.640 --> 03:17:30.640]  treaty they don't have that so what do they do they vote and they pass a law between the senate
[03:17:30.640 --> 03:17:36.480]  and the congress saying we are going to have a tpa a trade promotion authority we are going to ignore
[03:17:36.480 --> 03:17:42.320]  the requirements for a treaty to be ratified under the constitution and what we're going to say is
[03:17:42.320 --> 03:17:47.600]  there's going to be no debate there'll be no amendments we will have 20 hours of discussion
[03:17:47.600 --> 03:17:51.280]  max and then it's going to be a straight up and down simple majority vote
[03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:58.320]  of this document that was created by multinational corporations that our elected representatives
[03:17:58.320 --> 03:18:03.680]  had nothing to do with writing that our elected representatives were forbidden from telling the
[03:18:03.680 --> 03:18:09.360]  public about and they were the exception of senator sessions they all shut up and fell online
[03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:16.000]  that is disgusting and you want to be disgusted about that too there's a half dozen senators
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:22.720]  who voted against the tpa against the trade promotion of authorization but now it is there
[03:18:22.720 --> 03:18:27.200]  and when we see senators who are running for president now rampall voted against it twice
[03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:32.320]  he didn't say he didn't oppose it on the fact that it was a treaty and that they were
[03:18:32.320 --> 03:18:37.680]  openly voting to violate the constitutional process they can't do that they can't do that
[03:18:37.680 --> 03:18:41.920]  they have to amend the constitution if they're going to change that otherwise they're just violating
[03:18:41.920 --> 03:18:47.360]  their oath to the constitution and openly declaring that they are vassals of the corporate states
[03:18:48.400 --> 03:18:53.040]  and that's what you need to understand now Ted Cruz voted once to support
[03:18:53.840 --> 03:18:58.800]  eviscerating the constitution as far as that goes and then he voted against it but not saying
[03:18:58.800 --> 03:19:04.080]  that he had any specific problems with the process he had no problem violating the constitution
[03:19:04.080 --> 03:19:08.080]  just as he has no problem violating the constitution's requirements for citizenship
[03:19:08.080 --> 03:19:12.080]  Marco Rubio who also has no problems violating the constitution's requirement for natural born
[03:19:12.080 --> 03:19:16.400]  citizen he's an anchor baby he's not a natural born citizen and we've talked about this before
[03:19:16.400 --> 03:19:21.520]  i won't go into that again but of course he voted for it uh to pass this so that's the situation
[03:19:21.520 --> 03:19:27.760]  we've got people running for presidency who could care less about the constitution so we've got
[03:19:28.400 --> 03:19:33.120]  an introduction of an authorization for the use of military force that is international martial law
[03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:37.520]  we've got a senator says let's not get caught up in constitutional arguments let's just make
[03:19:37.520 --> 03:19:42.560]  everybody safe and secure with these executive orders from obama and then we have them denying
[03:19:42.560 --> 03:19:47.840]  that a treaty is a treaty so they can get this thing rammed through for their corporate masters
[03:19:47.840 --> 03:19:53.360]  congress is dissolving itself they have given all of their powers to the corporations and to the
[03:19:53.360 --> 03:19:58.400]  permanent bureaucracies that persist just like the lifetime appointments of the supreme court stay

[03:25:29.040 --> 03:25:36.240]  wars life dot com now laid out what's going on in this country and it is really at the final stages
[03:25:36.240 --> 03:25:39.520]  this has been going on for a very long time we have a permanent and trench bureaucracy that
[03:25:39.520 --> 03:25:44.800]  does precisely what they wish they have their each of them makes their own laws for their own
[03:25:44.800 --> 03:25:50.720]  little area of our life that they've carved out whether it's the epa or the atf or the irs
[03:25:50.720 --> 03:25:55.280]  they make and write their own laws congress leaves them alone unless there's a huge outcry and then
[03:25:55.280 --> 03:25:59.360]  they come in like knights on a white horse and say we're going to do something about that but
[03:25:59.360 --> 03:26:04.320]  otherwise they're too busy raising money for themselves and enjoying the perks of power
[03:26:04.320 --> 03:26:10.240]  quite frankly and so they write their own laws they have their own bureaucracy that goes out and
[03:26:10.240 --> 03:26:14.400]  accuses you of the laws that they wrote many times people don't really understand the complexity
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:19.920]  because you know when they're writing 81 000 plus pages of new rules every year we don't really keep
[03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:25.520]  up with that do we so it's very easy to get into deep trouble with them and just as we see in flint
[03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:31.440]  michigan you have the epa for the first time that i can remember i've seen a federal official
[03:26:31.440 --> 03:26:36.720]  actually even lose their job and it was a pretty severe situation that happened in flint michigan
[03:26:36.720 --> 03:26:41.600]  of course nobody lost their job when they blew up that gold mine when they were warned about it
[03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:45.520]  beforehand when many people said hey you're going to you're doing this are you doing this so that
[03:26:45.520 --> 03:26:50.880]  you can create a super fund so that you can grow your little empire fiefdom nevertheless they did
[03:26:50.880 --> 03:26:55.760]  it they blew up that gold mine they dumped toxic metals into the animus river that polluted three
[03:26:55.760 --> 03:27:01.520]  states in an indian reservation nobody went to jail for that nobody even lost their job that's the
[03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:06.240]  state of their tenure well they can do that kind of pollution they can turn a blind eye to what's
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:12.400]  going on in flint michigan yet you've got a guy who's got eight acres out i think what was it
[03:27:12.400 --> 03:27:18.240]  minnesota was wyoming or montana he had eight acres of land he digs a little pond in his land he
[03:27:18.240 --> 03:27:23.600]  has approval of state and local officials the water's not going off of his property for his
[03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:30.800]  livestock it's a pond for his children to play in and they're coming after him for $37,500 a day
[03:27:30.800 --> 03:27:35.040]  okay that's how out of control our bureaucracy is so what do we do what do we do to pull this back
[03:27:35.040 --> 03:27:39.360]  well let's talk about the gun control thing just as we had the senator barbara mikulski
[03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:44.720]  saying let's not clutter this up with any arguments about the constitution okay i don't want to hear
[03:27:44.720 --> 03:27:50.880]  that let's just make everybody safe and secure baloney right so here's the new american states
[03:27:50.880 --> 03:27:55.840]  step up efforts to nullify federal gun control edicts and what are they talking about they're
[03:27:55.840 --> 03:28:00.640]  not talking about creating a constitutional convention the problem we have in washington
[03:28:00.640 --> 03:28:07.120]  let me state this as clearly as i can we do not have a problem with the constitution we have a
[03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:12.880]  problem with criminal politicians in washington and if you get a shiny new amendment they're
[03:28:12.880 --> 03:28:20.080]  going to ignore that too the problem is not the law the problem is the failure to try the constitution
[03:28:20.080 --> 03:28:26.080]  it's never been tried in my lifetime let's try it for once it's not a perfect document if we tried it
[03:28:26.640 --> 03:28:31.440]  if we tried the constitution and we said yeah you know we're trying to be faithful to the
[03:28:31.440 --> 03:28:36.480]  constitution we got politicians who are obeying their oath in office when we have politicians
[03:28:36.480 --> 03:28:41.040]  or federal employees who break the law they are punished if we get to that state sometime
[03:28:41.040 --> 03:28:45.600]  then i would be willing to look at amendments to the constitution to say okay fine we're doing
[03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:50.720]  our best to obey the law with our federal officials let's see what we can do to make this work a
[03:28:50.720 --> 03:28:57.200]  little bit better we're not even close to that so i oppose giving this group of criminal thugs
[03:28:57.200 --> 03:29:02.880]  the ability to give themselves the authority to do whatever they want to because we don't have

[03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:23.840]  have them so the rightful remedy is nullification and as the new american points out we've had
[03:29:23.840 --> 03:29:29.280]  bills filed in virginia in south carolina that would prohibit state agencies from joining with

[03:29:33.840 --> 03:29:39.040]  not have authority to do that's the first thing we need to do we need to nullify these laws these

[03:33:16.480 --> 03:33:24.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david nighton joining me in this segment is wane
[03:33:24.640 --> 03:33:31.040]  madson and as i look at this article there was i think this is on a wnd a democrat facing murder
[03:33:31.040 --> 03:33:35.920]  charges is sworn into office behind bars and as i looked at this i thought is this what we're
[03:33:35.920 --> 03:33:40.160]  going to have with hillary will she become the president the first president behind bars we've
[03:33:40.160 --> 03:33:45.520]  got the hillary for prison uh maybe that's a possibility it ought to be in this particular case
[03:33:45.520 --> 03:33:49.920]  this is a suburb of chicago the guys pulled over for traffic stop they charge him a marijuana
[03:33:49.920 --> 03:33:54.560]  possession but they find a hundred thousand dollars worth of cash and then he's subsequently charged
[03:33:54.560 --> 03:34:01.440]  with a shooting death of ramundo camarillo junior and east chicago now while he's awaiting he's
[03:34:01.440 --> 03:34:08.720]  indicted he's in jail uh and he's sworn into office he was reelected by his democrat constituency
[03:34:08.720 --> 03:34:13.280]  wane madson is this what we're going to see with hillary clinton now i think we're seeing it across
[03:34:13.280 --> 03:34:18.800]  the board with the uh current some of the current presidential candidates you know the other thing
[03:34:18.800 --> 03:34:27.200]  you know it's very serious if she was putting sensitive compartmented information uh on a
[03:34:27.200 --> 03:34:34.800]  blackberry that that would be uh well i mean i i recall when i was in the navy we had some
[03:34:34.800 --> 03:34:43.200]  situations where the computer messed up and uh sci what they call a sense of compartment and
[03:34:43.200 --> 03:34:51.120]  information wound up on the other side the uh not uh above top secret side of the house
[03:34:51.120 --> 03:34:57.840]  and it was it was a huge thing and uh there had to be special inspections and yeah and
[03:34:57.840 --> 03:35:03.200]  admirals were briefed and presidents were briefed and well of course we had a an NSA whistleblower
[03:35:03.200 --> 03:35:08.720]  thomas drake was indicted they try to put him in prison for having unclassified documents on his
[03:35:08.720 --> 03:35:13.280]  computer just a couple of them of course she's got some of the most sensitive stuff in the world
[03:35:13.280 --> 03:35:18.320]  and as he pointed out this is somebody who's secretary of state she is a prime target for
[03:35:18.320 --> 03:35:23.200]  all kinds of people to examine her intelligence and she's putting them on a private home-based
[03:35:23.200 --> 03:35:28.000]  email server and and when richard reeves talked to her and said well we have this report about
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:32.320]  your email stuff this stuff just keeps rolling out even though she continues to deny we had
[03:35:32.320 --> 03:35:36.880]  yet another one come out yesterday after we'd been called that she was instructing people to
[03:35:36.880 --> 03:35:41.440]  remove the classification headings on their stuff so they could fax it and so forth and we had the
[03:35:41.440 --> 03:35:46.160]  emails where she's instructing people to do that now we've got yet another one uh coming out where
[03:35:46.160 --> 03:35:51.680]  she's telling people cut and paste the classified information so you can avoid the restrictions
[03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:57.200]  that we have in place yeah it's apparently what she had that was sci special compartment and
[03:35:57.200 --> 03:36:04.640]  information was imagery intelligence from drone aircraft so yeah that's imagery that's uh sensitive
[03:36:04.640 --> 03:36:11.040]  sources and methods so that would be protected at a very high level uh i really think that uh she's
[03:36:11.040 --> 03:36:18.400]  hemorrhaging bad uh right now and uh the blood is in the water and that's why we hear uh it's not
[03:36:18.400 --> 03:36:23.040]  bloomberg michael bloomberg isn't talking about running for president because he's afraid she's
[03:36:23.040 --> 03:36:28.080]  not going to be on a ticket it's going to be sanders he knows if there's going to be an opening
[03:36:28.080 --> 03:36:33.600]  probably uh she's going to probably have to pull her name out of out of the nomination and then
[03:36:33.600 --> 03:36:38.640]  they've got joe biden sitting there as well and he's been making well people have been making
[03:36:38.640 --> 03:36:45.040]  noise for him as a potential person to step in so and of course when we look at bloomberg he said
[03:36:45.040 --> 03:36:48.880]  we're going to make our decision in march well by march what they'll know is several things first
[03:36:48.880 --> 03:36:52.320]  of all they'll have a better idea as to whether or not they're actually going to move forward
[03:36:52.320 --> 03:36:58.400]  a prosecution on hillary but they'll also be able to look at these beginning uh primaries and caucuses
[03:36:58.400 --> 03:37:03.040]  you know we've got uh iowa new hampshire nevada south carolina and then the very beginning of
[03:37:03.040 --> 03:37:08.400]  march we have a massive number of primaries and caucuses that are about half of the country and
[03:37:08.400 --> 03:37:12.080]  those are winter take all type of things so that's the things are going to fall into place pretty
[03:37:12.080 --> 03:37:17.280]  quickly at that point and then he's got a lot of time to get on as an independent and he has the
[03:37:17.280 --> 03:37:20.640]  money to do it he's going to need about a million signatures but of course that's going to be a
[03:37:20.640 --> 03:37:26.080]  drop in the bucket him he can get hired he can hire a paid petitioners to do that and he has a
[03:37:26.080 --> 03:37:31.840]  deadline in most of the states of august or september to get on the ballot as an independent
[03:37:31.840 --> 03:37:36.560]  candidate throughout most of the country yeah you know and this election year is not going to
[03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:43.040]  favor the incumbent party in the white house it rarely does so all attention is going to be on
[03:37:43.040 --> 03:37:50.160]  the republican uh candidate and that nomination process like i think she's in trouble anyway with
[03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:57.040]  bernie sanders sanders is surging uh and uh i mean they'll be an attempt to try to ease him out of
[03:37:57.040 --> 03:38:00.720]  the and they're going to have i'm not going to i'm not going to say they're going to have chicago
[03:38:00.720 --> 03:38:07.120]  68 the democratic convention where they actually had fights break out on the floor of the convention
[03:38:07.120 --> 03:38:13.040]  hall inside and outside right it's going to be a nasty it's going to be nasty and it's going to be one
[03:38:13.040 --> 03:38:18.960]  one heck of a convention in philadelphia yeah you know i'm interested to think to see what you think
[03:38:18.960 --> 03:38:25.600]  about uh tom delay uh the inside story about him saying that the fbi is ready to indict he says
[03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:30.160]  sources that he have talked has talked to say that uh they want to indict if the attorney general
[03:38:30.160 --> 03:38:34.640]  does not move forward with this they're willing to go public what do you make about that uh i'm a
[03:38:34.640 --> 03:38:40.800]  little skeptical because it it nobody has access to grand jury information and we don't even know
[03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:46.240]  if this is before grand jury you have to have a grand jury to indict so i i'm i that that stuff
[03:38:46.240 --> 03:38:53.360]  is usually kept i you know i covered the many of these cases uh during grand jury uh hearings at
[03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:59.520]  the federal courthouse in washington dc and uh during the scooter liby uh a trial for example
[03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:05.520]  and it was almost impossible you couldn't get any leaks out of the grand jury we knew the grand jury
[03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:11.200]  was there meeting but it's impossible to get any information that that stuff is really uh because
[03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:16.560]  you could you could declare miss trials could be declared cases it could be dropped if any of that
[03:39:16.560 --> 03:39:20.560]  stuff leaked out you know it's interesting the same day that came out which is yesterday that came
[03:39:20.560 --> 03:39:26.960]  out on newsmax there was a story from the washington post uh talking about how david patreas avoided
[03:39:26.960 --> 03:39:31.760]  felony charges and possible prison time so here you have the leftist establishment saying you know
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:36.240]  well this is what happened david patreas and it was a good thing and they do talk about that way
[03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:41.360]  and they do talk about the process that went on in the back rooms they said that uh the people who
[03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:45.840]  had investigated this pitched it to attorney general eric holder at the time fbi director
[03:39:45.840 --> 03:39:51.200]  james comey uh they listened as prosecutors did a mock run through the government's case so forth
[03:39:51.200 --> 03:39:56.800]  and so on so what the washington post is doing is laying out a a plan here saying yeah you know
[03:39:56.800 --> 03:40:01.760]  remember they let david patreas off so maybe we shouldn't be so hard on hillray yeah well the
[03:40:01.760 --> 03:40:08.000]  thing is about patreas a former head of the cia they would probably what happened there is his
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:13.440]  attorneys were threatening a gray male uh the the prosecutors the justice department gray male means
[03:40:13.440 --> 03:40:18.960]  look we know a lot of things because he was the cia guy and he knew everything yeah oliver nor
[03:40:18.960 --> 03:40:26.640]  oliver nor did this uh and and uh it's been done and it's been done several other times uh and patreas
[03:40:26.640 --> 03:40:31.440]  isn't the first guy that oh eric prince the guy from blackwater did it too and of course they
[03:40:31.440 --> 03:40:35.840]  never prosecuted him either sure yeah oh don't you think that hillray's got a lot of gray male it's
[03:40:35.840 --> 03:40:40.800]  not just the the the emails that she's got on her servers she's got a lot of uh gray male that she
[03:40:40.800 --> 03:40:46.880]  can be great mailing them through her if she's got attorneys lined up and or i doubt it's even
[03:40:46.880 --> 03:40:51.760]  that far but if it comes to that i'm sure there'll be a lot of gray mailing going on because she
[03:40:51.760 --> 03:40:57.920]  again knows a lot about what's been going on so hillray has uh really kind of three things going
[03:40:57.920 --> 03:41:02.480]  on she's got a significant challenge from bernie sanders uh she's got a health challenge like we
[03:41:02.480 --> 03:41:06.960]  saw yesterday on the dredger board that was that was interesting to watch that video about a uh a
[03:41:06.960 --> 03:41:10.880]  full minute and she's coughing can't get a breath and even at the end of the minute when that clip
[03:41:10.880 --> 03:41:15.760]  stopped she still wasn't able to talk and that's not the first time that's happened and then she's uh
[03:41:15.760 --> 03:41:20.400]  got this situation with these uh legal issues that are there which i think as you point out you
[03:41:20.400 --> 03:41:24.160]  know she's going to be able to handle that she's got a lot of people that she can black male gray
[03:41:24.160 --> 03:41:28.880]  male or otherwise threaten of course we have a long list of people uh that have come up against
[03:41:28.880 --> 03:41:33.360]  the clinton's and are no longer with us uh let's talk a little bit about what's going on on the
[03:41:33.360 --> 03:41:38.400]  republican side and and when i when i look at this authorization for the use of military force as one
[03:41:38.400 --> 03:41:43.600]  senator said it is a uh international martial law i find it interesting that one of the four
[03:41:43.600 --> 03:41:49.600]  people who signed on to this thing that was dropped was uh and joining us now is as alex jones hey alex
[03:41:49.600 --> 03:41:55.520]  do you want to keep going i don't want to interrupt i'm just in the other room watching you guys and
[03:41:55.520 --> 03:41:59.440]  in our in our great correspondent wane madson and i'm i'm just spending her two minutes i'm gonna
[03:41:59.440 --> 03:42:05.760]  leave i just wanted to point out that it just hit me that we've been so conditioned myself included
[03:42:05.760 --> 03:42:11.360]  by successive approximation that now ron paul and a u.s senator as well republican and democrat
[03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:15.360]  come out and say yeah no this is basically the biggest blank check in history it's it's worldwide
[03:42:15.360 --> 03:42:21.040]  military martial law that senator said that last thursday we didn't know till friday i didn't know
[03:42:21.040 --> 03:42:27.200]  the senator had said anything i didn't either uh until uh sunday no no no no no no until last
[03:42:27.200 --> 03:42:33.440]  night monday night info wars didn't know some of the biggest worst legislation ever was going on
[03:42:33.440 --> 03:42:39.200]  a senator warned and there was no media until our listeners contacted us on friday instead of you've
[03:42:39.200 --> 03:42:45.680]  seen this legislation that is being pushed by the leadership and set to pass so it's such a big deal
[03:42:45.680 --> 03:42:49.920]  that we've gotten to the point where we're talking about tyranny coming coming they do it incrementally
[03:42:50.800 --> 03:42:54.960]  we're not saying this will be martial law troops in the streets tomorrow it's just putting it in
[03:42:54.960 --> 03:42:59.920]  showing their building towards it we need to make this a big issue we've done that on other issues
[03:42:59.920 --> 03:43:03.120]  but i almost started hyperventilating over this because it's so dangerous it's such a big deal and
[03:43:03.120 --> 03:43:06.080]  then in closing i'm gonna let you go back to wane madson i'm just going to inject this here because
[03:43:06.080 --> 03:43:11.520]  i didn't do a good job of this today and i was just meeting with the accountants 15 minutes ago
[03:43:11.520 --> 03:43:15.040]  before i went back in my office and had the tv radio show on i was listening to you and wane
[03:43:15.040 --> 03:43:20.800]  madson uh you know talk about these issues we're doing okay compared to glenn becky's in trouble
[03:43:20.800 --> 03:43:25.520]  and a lot of their media falling apart we can stay the size we are but to send reporters out
[03:43:25.520 --> 03:43:29.920]  to really be able to cover this to be able to maybe get a few more people to really aggressively

[03:44:15.280 --> 03:44:19.920]  hardly plug on my own show today and i'm just we're having meetings they say listen the economy's
[03:44:19.920 --> 03:44:23.600]  falling apart everything's going to hell you are able to fund us with your great listeners
[03:44:23.600 --> 03:44:27.120]  you know i'm so they're talking to the accountant but you've got to plug and everybody's got to
[03:44:27.120 --> 03:44:31.200]  promote it and everybody's got to know the specials because if we don't do that i'm going to stop
[03:44:31.200 --> 03:44:35.360]  in fact i'm going to say right now even when donald trump's on or or a huge guest nobody
[03:44:35.360 --> 03:44:41.200]  else in radio skips breaks like i do it just has to stop uh it has to stop it's me that's doing it
[03:44:41.200 --> 03:44:45.440]  this is my problem i'm having so i'm just being honest about it on here that we're so committed
[03:44:45.440 --> 03:44:50.320]  to fighting tyranny we forget to resupply sometimes and i want the listeners to know it's up to you
[03:44:50.320 --> 03:44:54.960]  to spread the word you're doing it but we're victims of our own success with our own video stream
[03:44:54.960 --> 03:44:59.760]  16 million people in a month tuned into that which is great we have to have our own platform people
[03:44:59.760 --> 03:45:04.400]  say don't use youtube have your own platform well we do have our own platform it's in higher
[03:45:04.400 --> 03:45:10.240]  res than you know facebook mentions and stuff but it's a win-win i have we didn't even cut ads
[03:45:10.240 --> 03:45:13.840]  to write on that video it's mainly network ads we didn't get paid for you know it's like we don't
[03:45:13.840 --> 03:45:18.960]  even think to like put a video feed out and actually have our own ads on it so so we've dominated
[03:45:18.960 --> 03:45:24.560]  here's one last thing i'm not attacking blend back i'm not an infighter for three years we've had
[03:45:24.560 --> 03:45:29.760]  political science theater uh here you know model for mystery science theater on election night and on
[03:45:29.760 --> 03:45:35.520]  state of the unions they now started it last week the last debate and call it political science
[03:45:35.520 --> 03:45:41.440]  theater and literally copy us with graphics the name word for word and i have to be careful and
[03:45:41.440 --> 03:45:46.560]  come out and say hey he's taking our stuff because he will claim that's his and come after us because
[03:45:47.440 --> 03:45:51.200]  it's like a body snatcher they don't just put the pod next to you and then a creature pops out
[03:45:51.200 --> 03:45:57.040]  that looks like you they get rid of the body and so i can't let him get rid of me and steal my identity
[03:45:57.040 --> 03:46:03.360]  i mean i was told by insiders whenever he was at cnn and fox he would have to five people listen
[03:46:03.360 --> 03:46:07.440]  to every word i said writing scripts but then she's an actor he's all into thespian that's why he
[03:46:07.440 --> 03:46:11.680]  takes acting lessons he is an actor he's be a big liberal pro-abortion you know anti-gun
[03:46:11.680 --> 03:46:17.680]  globalist and i'm not attacking the guy's thinking himself i wanted to be allies with him uh but but
[03:46:17.680 --> 03:46:23.040]  i mean i just cannot sit there and i want wayne to respond as i'm going and literally watch a guy
[03:46:23.040 --> 03:46:26.960]  that makes hundreds of millions of dollars and spends so much of it you know he can't even operate
[03:46:26.960 --> 03:46:29.520]  basically that's what i've been told by tv networks and others that he's trying to get rid of his
[03:46:29.520 --> 03:46:33.040]  channel maybe that's not true but i've been told that by two different tv networks and and and
[03:46:33.040 --> 03:46:38.400]  i'll help some other big insiders huge insiders obviously about as big as it gets so i don't
[03:46:38.400 --> 03:46:45.440]  want to fight with beck i want him to stay around but he sees it as i can't be here for him to exist
[03:46:45.440 --> 03:46:49.680]  and beck we're all fighting i thought for the same reason uh but they actually kept telling me hey
[03:46:49.680 --> 03:46:55.040]  you know they have the same and i went i saw they just showed it to me and it is literally what we do
[03:46:55.040 --> 03:47:01.040]  the same name now the young turks are copying us uh you know the greatest form of flattery of of
[03:47:01.040 --> 03:47:06.560]  sincerity is imitation that's fine young turks didn't call it political science theater yeah
[03:47:06.560 --> 03:47:12.960]  okay so so i just have to say you know we you know you know we are the patriots we were here
[03:47:12.960 --> 03:47:17.920]  first i've been doing this 21 years i'm not territorial beck i hope becomes just like me
[03:47:17.920 --> 03:47:21.840]  love him to death does a lot of good work okay i just don't want to lay down and go to sleep next
[03:47:21.840 --> 03:47:26.080]  to the green pod i just i'm okay you can have your own shape you can be your own creature you
[03:47:26.080 --> 03:47:29.760]  can even make yourself look just like me and i'm gonna be nice because i could probably win some
[03:47:29.760 --> 03:47:34.400]  legal stuff over this stuff uh you know i think i better trademark that or they'll take it and do
[03:47:34.400 --> 03:47:39.840]  it to me i mean you know it's really getting weird uh so i know alex jones in osa texas not alex
[03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:45.280]  jones in in in um in dalis it calls himself going back okay okay i don't have i'm not an
[03:47:45.280 --> 03:47:49.520]  i'm not an actor i don't have i know that's why x files based on the character on me
[03:47:49.520 --> 03:47:53.760]  the inauthentic character they info wars is their new script it was human animal chimeras
[03:47:53.760 --> 03:47:58.080]  last night that's chris carter that's fine chris carter gave us credit and didn't you know
[03:47:58.640 --> 03:48:05.440]  because i he understands plagiarism okay he's not a plagiarist okay so info wars.com x2

[03:48:22.160 --> 03:48:27.680]  wane madson and wane madson report.com and back to david knight sorry for crashing in no problem
[03:48:27.680 --> 03:48:32.000]  alex and and what he was talking about wane is the fact that it was the end of last week that
[03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:37.520]  we saw this on defense one which is really kind of a trade magazine and so it's kind of a trade
[03:48:37.520 --> 03:48:40.960]  publication for the defense industry and they kind of just mentioned that they've got this
[03:48:40.960 --> 03:48:44.320]  authorization for the use of military force hey you know there might be some more profit coming
[03:48:44.320 --> 03:48:49.120]  down the line or what from that angle they weren't coming at it from the fact that hey this is
[03:48:49.120 --> 03:48:54.160]  international martial law and as alex pointed out uh he you know we immediately saw that he
[03:48:54.160 --> 03:48:58.240]  used that term he didn't know the senator had already said that and to his credit
[03:48:58.240 --> 03:49:02.160]  we've got a democrat senator who says the same thing at the same time ron paul is saying the
[03:49:02.160 --> 03:49:06.400]  same thing so we've got some good people in washington but for the most part we've got people
[03:49:06.400 --> 03:49:10.560]  who are trying to push this thing through without any supervision without any oversight
[03:49:10.560 --> 03:49:15.760]  we had four people republicans sign on with mitch mcconnell as he introduces this on the eve of
[03:49:15.760 --> 03:49:20.880]  snowmageddon of course one of those is lindsay graham another one interestingly enough is joanie
[03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:27.840]  urts now she's a senator in iowa right and she has done everything she can to endorse marco rubio
[03:49:27.840 --> 03:49:32.880]  without officially endorsing it in the same way that grassley has has done everything he can do it
[03:49:32.880 --> 03:49:38.560]  to endorse donald trump without officially endorsing him right right and governor brandstad i think is
[03:49:38.560 --> 03:49:48.640]  probably in the tank for uh probably uh rubio um it's not certain he doesn't like cruz oh yeah he
[03:49:48.640 --> 03:49:54.240]  doesn't like to he dis endorsed cruz yeah officially endorse anybody else he doesn't like trump either
[03:49:54.240 --> 03:50:01.280]  so he's going to go to one of the others um who knows who it'll be it could be rubio of course he's
[03:50:01.280 --> 03:50:08.560]  got a big problem now and then this reminds me so much of of um well what i discovered about
[03:50:08.560 --> 03:50:15.120]  barack obama unfortunately it was after he got inaugurated as president rubio's got a huge uh
[03:50:16.640 --> 03:50:24.160]  possible gay prostitution uh issue from his past in miami well what i find interesting
[03:50:24.160 --> 03:50:31.440]  is this connection with joanie urts the fact that rubio was the only republican uh who who endorsed
[03:50:31.440 --> 03:50:36.640]  her during her primary gave her nearly a quarter of a million dollars from his pack to help her
[03:50:36.640 --> 03:50:42.640]  win and of course she is somebody who is firmly in the neocon war party we can see that with her
[03:50:42.640 --> 03:50:47.840]  endorsement of this international declaration of martial law and her connections to marco rubio stay
[03:50:47.840 --> 03:51:03.200]  with us we'll be right back with wane madsen my name is don whiskin and at 42 years old i suffered a

[03:54:07.680 --> 03:54:12.640]  going to get back to what's going on with the uh with the political class we've looked at hillary
[03:54:12.640 --> 03:54:18.080]  clinton the fact that the establishment is throwing out articles about how david patreus
[03:54:18.080 --> 03:54:22.160]  avoided felony charges that's coming from the washington post perhaps they're trying to prepare
[03:54:22.160 --> 03:54:27.040]  us for the disappointment that they're not going to prosecute hillary clinton but she's got a lot
[03:54:27.040 --> 03:54:31.440]  of other problems she's got a bernie sanders problem she's got a perhaps a health problem
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:36.240]  and speaking of health problems make sure you don't get sick like hillary we've got a special
[03:54:36.240 --> 03:54:42.160]  going on that ends today survival shield x2 nascent iodine we have super male female vitality

[03:54:49.280 --> 03:54:56.000]  mentioned if you buy $50 or more you get free shipping that is a huge savings and it's something
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:00.400]  to think about when you just see what happened throughout the northeast we've got people who
[03:55:00.400 --> 03:55:06.320]  still cannot move about in their areas after four days of snow they can't get out and around
[03:55:07.280 --> 03:55:11.920]  many times this is happening and i've seen it myself happen in buffalo new york of all
[03:55:11.920 --> 03:55:16.320]  places where people got snowbound for several days there with all the snow equipment that they have
[03:55:16.320 --> 03:55:23.040]  there so sometimes even the very best intentions of a government can't deliver and so you need to
[03:55:23.040 --> 03:55:28.160]  be able to take care of yourself take care of your health 15 off survival shield x2 super male

[03:55:35.280 --> 03:55:42.320]  shipping now wane as we were talking about this with marco rubio and i think it's real key for
[03:55:42.320 --> 03:55:48.640]  people to understand and i think people are most especially our listeners understand that rubio
[03:55:48.640 --> 03:55:54.000]  jeb chris christy they're the establishment wing they're the people who are pushing for the the
[03:55:54.000 --> 03:55:58.880]  national security state they want war everywhere they want to spy on us here at home these are the
[03:55:58.880 --> 03:56:04.880]  people who want international martial law they want it against us and the the only good news i see
[03:56:04.880 --> 03:56:10.000]  is that people are not buying it certainly not in the gop and not even the democrat party either i
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:14.960]  mean hillary clinton who is a a stronger believer in that part of the party is is suffering with
[03:56:14.960 --> 03:56:21.920]  bernie sanders when we look at marco rubio and jeb bush combined uh they are well under donald
[03:56:21.920 --> 03:56:27.440]  trump in their home state we got the former governor of florida at only 14 and a half percent uh i'm
[03:56:27.440 --> 03:56:31.520]  sorry he's at nine percent and rubio is at 14 and a half percent so they're at about 24 percent
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:39.280]  combined and trump is at 39 percent so he's he's beating them together and uh and so that's that's
[03:56:39.280 --> 03:56:43.680]  what i'm concerned about when i see people like this new freshman senator joni erntz who's now
[03:56:43.680 --> 03:56:49.680]  out at herself as part of the lindsay graham john mccain neo con wing uh with the support of
[03:56:49.680 --> 03:56:53.680]  international martial law with their support of marco rubio that's what i think we really need to
[03:56:53.680 --> 03:57:00.080]  keep in mind yeah and and the stuff that's coming out about rubio now remember jeb bush said he was
[03:57:00.080 --> 03:57:06.640]  going to get he was going to go really uh hard on on rubio used to be his friend and you know this
[03:57:06.640 --> 03:57:12.400]  was a mentor relationship so so the stuff that came out in the washington post yesterday about his
[03:57:13.040 --> 03:57:21.200]  so-called crimes for being arrested in 1990 uh in a park in miami alice wane rake park which was
[03:57:21.200 --> 03:57:27.840]  a known pickup place for uh gay guys to pick up young guys and he was arrested with his friend
[03:57:27.840 --> 03:57:33.440]  in a car after closing hours at the park drinking beer that looks like maybe that was plea bargain
[03:57:33.440 --> 03:57:41.040]  down because there was something else going on there uh this friend of his uh was uh later and
[03:57:41.040 --> 03:57:45.680]  they room together after high school i know people room together in college but after graduating
[03:57:45.680 --> 03:57:53.600]  from high school rooming together this almost sounds like another obama situation um so anyway
[03:57:53.600 --> 03:58:00.320]  rubio's friend opens up a uh a gay porn business where they're filming latinos and black guys
