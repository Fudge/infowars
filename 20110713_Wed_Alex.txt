[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:35.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35.000 --> 00:46.000]  Today is Wednesday, the 13th day of July, 2011, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:46.000 --> 00:59.000]  Tony Ferrell, who was a high-level counterterrorism analyst for the South Yorkshire Police in Britain from 98 to 2010,
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  will be joining us dealing with government-sponsored terrorism coming up in the second hour today.
[01:05.000 --> 01:12.000]  Headline, police intelligence analyst fired for blowing whistle on false flag terror.
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.000]  I thought then we would pull up some of the mainstream articles in Britain,
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.000]  where the IRA, it turns out, was run by British intelligence, the violent arm of it, as a pretext.
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  And we even interviewed Agent Steakknife here on the broadcast.
[01:29.000 --> 01:30.000]  Here's another headline.
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  A British double agent was real IRA Omaha bomb team.
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  It just goes through all of that information, how that was government-sponsored terror, the vast majority of it.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  We'll also look at the supposed Muslim bombings of 7-7, and we'll look at 9-11.
[01:47.000 --> 01:57.000]  And of course, that dovetails is unfortunately quite nicely with the huge report that it turns out was on MSNBC last week,
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  and it was brought to our attention.
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  This was hidden in plain view by a listener yesterday.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  And the YouTube clip of the MSNBC piece is up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  Bombshell, Saudi and U.S. governments protected hijackers.
[02:15.000 --> 02:27.000]  And that is from Senator, former Florida governor, Bob Graham, said at least two of the purported 9-11 hijackers had assistance from Saudi Arabia.
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  Graham's recently released novel Keys of the Kingdom implicates the Saudis.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  He told MSNBC the novel is based on factual information.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  So we're going to be going over that.
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  But the mainstream dinosaur dying media is focusing on the Saudi connection, which we have always covered.
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.000]  But the fact that Graham also said the U.S. government was protecting him, well, no kidding, they were trained at U.S. military bases.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  And people don't want to look at these facts.
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.000]  They don't want to grow up.
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  They don't want to face the fact that the federal government shipped tens of thousands of firearms into Mexico to destabilize Mexico,
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  to knock out their drug cartel competition, and to, of course, a false flag blame the Second Amendment.
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.000]  We're going to be looking at government-sponsored terrorism coming up in depth in the second hour today,
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  because it is the ace in the hole the establishment has.
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.000]  We've damaged that ace.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  The ace is partially exposed.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  But I can look at the political juxtapositions.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  I can look at the political climate.
[03:28.000 --> 03:38.000]  And I can tell you, unequivocally, they're trying to resuscitate the 9-11 hoax and fairy tale and make-believe Santa Claus story.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  Tooth fairy story, because they want to invoke false flag terror again in a big way.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  And I'm not talking about provocaturing numbsculls out of prisons with the FBI leading groups,
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  trying to get them to do bombings on Christmas Day and things like that with useful idiots.
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.000]  That's one type of stage terror.
[03:55.000 --> 04:04.000]  I'm talking about pure stage terror, where there are no morons involved except for double agents who were set up and burned like 9-11.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  We know the hijackers were taking part in drills and were given U.S. government protection.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  That's on record, been on record for almost 10 years.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  Well, actually we knew about it before 9-11, so it's longer than 10 years.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  So we're going to be going over all of that coming up in the second hour,
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  because the only way they're going to get their world government,
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  the only way they're going to get their police state fully in place,
[04:25.000 --> 04:33.000]  the only way they're going to shell the population on living under tyranny is that it's being done for their safety because of terrorism.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  So we're going to be going over all of this today.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  You know, they're saying Qaddafi is going to start terror attacks,
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  and Qaddafi is under military attack.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  If he militarily strikes back at Europe, that's going to be called a terror attack,
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  and of course we'll have to give up more liberties,
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  because the establishment funded Al Qaeda to attack Qaddafi,
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  and if he fights back its terrorism,
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  and if you're not forgiving your rights up, you're with Al Qaeda,
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  even though Al Qaeda is attacking Qaddafi, working for Northcom and the rest of them publicly.
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[06:00.000 --> 06:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[06:12.000 --> 06:21.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[06:21.000 --> 06:29.000]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[06:29.000 --> 06:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[06:39.000 --> 06:46.000]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[06:46.000 --> 06:53.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[06:53.000 --> 06:55.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[06:55.000 --> 07:00.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  Terany is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[07:17.000 --> 07:24.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[07:24.000 --> 07:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[07:34.000 --> 07:44.000]  Repair to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[08:11.000 --> 08:22.000]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:22.000 --> 08:42.000]  It is Wednesday, the 13th day of July, 2011. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[08:42.000 --> 08:50.000]  Let me just give you a brief overview of the news we have in front of us here.
[08:50.000 --> 09:01.000]  We have, of course, Obama saying that he cannot guarantee that Social Security checks will go out August 3rd if you don't capitulate to the Manisters
[09:01.000 --> 09:11.000]  and let the United States completely collapse into Third World Banana Republic status.
[09:11.000 --> 09:21.000]  Also, continuing, I have these quotes out of the Huffington Post, but I don't ever believe anything they say, so I checked it.
[09:21.000 --> 09:31.000]  It's also in the Associated Press that Senator Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, came out yesterday and proposed.
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  Now, Republicans refused to go along with it, so he had to back off.
[09:35.000 --> 09:49.000]  The point is, he proposed for Congress to give up the power of the purse and to transfer its power to levy taxes, to sign on to foreign debts to the president.
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  And why not? Congress has already handed over the power to make war to the president, the power to set up carbon taxes and regulations to the president.
[09:56.000 --> 10:07.000]  The president is announcing, he announced Friday that in the next few weeks they're going to sign executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment, and they add this Orwellian flourish to the end of the statement,
[10:07.000 --> 10:21.000]  the White House Communications Director did last Friday, that this will be something we can all agree upon, putting folks on a no-gun buy list, just like the no-fly list, extra judiciary, no facts, no reason,
[10:21.000 --> 10:29.000]  no judge, no jury, no recourse, no day in court, just you don't own guns anymore, ba-ba.
[10:29.000 --> 10:39.000]  And even on the heels of Fast and Furious, being admitted to be a federal program run by the Justice Department with the Attorney General Eric Holder perjuring himself,
[10:39.000 --> 10:55.000]  now it turns out the FBI DEA are involved, not just ATF, in helping ship the guns into Mexico directly to Los Zetas, the cartel trained by the Pentagon, and of course School of America's in formenting Georgia.
[10:55.000 --> 11:05.000]  They don't care. They now have expanded the program that we told you they would expand, ordering gun shops from Texas through New Mexico, Arizona, California,
[11:05.000 --> 11:13.000]  that when someone buys high-powered rifles to, quote, report them to the ATF. Now, that's a sick joke.
[11:13.000 --> 11:22.000]  Of course, ladies and gentlemen, it's like the government telling you what type of light bulbs you can have, or what type of toilet you can have, or what type of paint you can have.
[11:22.000 --> 11:29.000]  It's all about you just following orders outside of law, because there is no law that you've got to do that with the ATF.
[11:29.000 --> 11:42.000]  They know full well there's already the instant check that grew out of the five-day waiting period, where they run a background check for felonies and warrants when you go and buy any firearm,
[11:42.000 --> 11:52.000]  and it lists how many firearms you're buying, handguns, rifles, shotguns, and they know exactly what you're getting.
[11:52.000 --> 12:02.000]  Instantly in the next system, in the computer, when you call, you talk to an FBI operator. I've been there many times buying a firearm,
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.000]  and that's how they do it, and everybody who's bought a gun knows that. So why would the ATF say, well, now when you're selling high-powered rifles,
[12:08.000 --> 12:17.000]  which they consider to be anything above a.22 caliber, and somebody's buying these, you need to go ahead and call us.
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  That is simply allowing them to trigger an investigation so they can come out to your house and arrest you.
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  We've already seen cases in the last decade of ATF visiting people that buy, quote, more than 500 rounds of ammo.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  I've seen it in Texas, I've seen it in New York. They also have deputized sheriff's deputies in many counties.
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  They will come out and ask, why'd you buy 1,000 rounds of ammo? Well, because ammo keeps going up in price, and I want to have plenty of.308 ammo.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  Why are you here at my house? I have no criminal record. I mean, don't you have criminals to deal with?
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  They're like, how about you just let us in your house, Mr. Johnson? I remember seeing this six, seven years ago in Dallas, Texas,
[12:54.000 --> 13:02.000]  Dallas Morning News reported that they have knock and talk, and now in Boston and New York, they actually force their way in without a warrant.
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.000]  But first, it's a federal grant for local police to train them. First, they just knock and say, we'd like to come in and check your guns,
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  make sure they're safe. Would you like us to look at your guns, ma'am? They always do it in the middle of the day, middle class areas,
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  and a lot of women get scared and go in and let the cops in. I mean, this is just training the cops, acclimating the media, the public,
[13:22.000 --> 13:32.000]  that cops come to your house to talk about your guns, your legal guns. Handgun control incorporated admits that's what the federal grants for gun buyback programs are about.
[13:32.000 --> 13:40.000]  When they say, bring your guns in, and it's almost always old ladies, their husband has died or gone to the nursing home. I've seen cases of shotguns
[13:40.000 --> 13:50.000]  that are worth more than $10,000, finally carved collector's items, just being given to the cops for a $50 coupon, and the cops are laughing.
[13:50.000 --> 13:58.000]  And in a lot of cities, the cops you've seen end up getting in trouble, because quite frankly, I don't blame them. I'm not saying they should do this,
[13:58.000 --> 14:07.000]  but I don't blame them that they don't destroy them. They end up keeping them for themselves and selling them. And it's like police busted selling guns from buyback.
[14:07.000 --> 14:18.000]  Well, if an old lady brings in a finally carved double barrel, 50-something-year-old shotgun worth $10,000, I mean, it's a crime to destroy those guns.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  I'm not saying the cops should be selling it out the back door. They shouldn't be doing it in the beginning.
[14:24.000 --> 14:33.000]  I mean, if the old lady comes up with a $10,000 shotgun, you should say, you might want a $1,000 AR-15, whatever the case is.
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  You know, they've got a lot of specialty guns out there. Don't do it.
[14:37.000 --> 14:47.000]  I've seen cases of people turning in civil war collector north and south rifles that are worth thousands of dollars.
[14:47.000 --> 15:00.000]  I mean, it is almost always men who marry women who were anti-gun, the man dies, or the man's the nursing home, and the poor dingbat goes in.
[15:00.000 --> 15:12.000]  See, I've got all this news to cover. I'm already digressing. The issue here is that they are now unveiling, oh, we have a new ATF rule.
[15:12.000 --> 15:20.000]  Not a congressional law, the ATF says, when somebody buys a high-power rifle, you call us, the ATF says.
[15:20.000 --> 15:30.000]  And then next, now, the ATF says this, and Obama says, there's not a law, Obama says his regulators, who are former presidents of GE,
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  they get to keep their power plants, but yours are shut down, and they're publicly giving themselves waivers.
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  This is mafia government. This is dictatorship. And so I'll cover this now.
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  Then I'm going to get into U.S. Senator Calls for Newscore Probe on the hacking over in England by Rupert Murdoch's people.
[15:49.000 --> 15:59.000]  Also, gold is at an all-time high. As of this morning, Kurt had it gold close to breaking record as Euro's zone debt crisis worsens.
[15:59.000 --> 16:11.000]  It has now broken that. It's what, right up at $1,500 and right at $90 or right below it, silver's also rocketing upwards.
[16:11.000 --> 16:16.000]  We told you that was going to happen. They do these manipulations in the paper market to drive it down.
[16:16.000 --> 16:23.000]  But then every time it retraces its previous heights and eclipses those, we're going to be breaking that down today.
[16:23.000 --> 16:33.000]  We've got incredible guests joining us. He was the top analyst in the major British police department on terror threat, matrix prediction systems,
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  and his research found it's the government staging the real large-scale terror attacks.
[16:39.000 --> 16:48.000]  His findings were there are low-scale, low-tech Muslim terrorists, no kidding, who do attack on occasion, but it's very rare.
[16:48.000 --> 16:59.000]  It's like finding a leprechaun in your backyard. It's entering the realm of fantasy, but some say Santa Claus does exist and that it's the government doing it.
[16:59.000 --> 17:09.000]  So he'll be joining us. And of course, former Florida governor Bob Graham came out, one of the head commissioners in the 9-11 commission,
[17:09.000 --> 17:16.000]  and said the U.S. government and Saudi government were protecting and funding at least two of the hijackers.
[17:16.000 --> 17:24.000]  And everybody's like, ooh, Alex, you're right. Wow, how'd you know this? Well, Graham wrote this five years ago.
[17:24.000 --> 17:30.000]  This was in the Washington Post three years ago. But I have Newsweek. I have the Sacramento Bee.
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.000]  I have the Associated Press. I have the San Jose Mercury News.
[17:35.000 --> 17:47.000]  I have the FBI agents in Phoenix and Minneapolis, St. Paul and Norman, Oklahoma, in Dallas, Texas, and St. Louis and San Diego,
[17:47.000 --> 17:52.000]  all on record saying they knew exactly what was going to happen on 9-11 and were ordered to stand down.
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.000]  I mean, I have big stacks of mainstream news right after 9-11. That all came out.
[17:57.000 --> 18:04.000]  And I was the bad man for talking about it. I'm like, okay, well, heads of the U.S. embassies are saying they were ordered to let them into the U.S.
[18:04.000 --> 18:14.000]  and that they were U.S. agents, kernels that headed up, spy schools said that the hijackers were in their classes.
[18:14.000 --> 18:20.000]  Newsweek reports they were at U.S. Air Force bases here. I've got big stacks. It's all confirmed.
[18:20.000 --> 18:28.000]  They were led in by the government, protected. Dr. James Woods saw Muhammad Atta and others doing drills on the plane like hijacking.
[18:28.000 --> 18:35.000]  And he tried to warn the government they didn't want to talk to him. It was five days before 9-11 or six days before 9-11.
[18:35.000 --> 18:43.000]  I mean, Atta and others were running drills just like the TSA, you know, does drills and sneaking bombs through.
[18:43.000 --> 18:50.000]  You better watch out, by the way, of your DEA, FBI, CIA, SEAL Team 6 who does drills through the airports.
[18:50.000 --> 18:59.000]  This is how they'll do it, especially if you're, quote, part of the new Muslim brigades that our military, our government, our supposed government has set up, quote.
[18:59.000 --> 19:06.000]  We want to recruit you American Muslims to join the CIA. You see the ads on TV.
[19:06.000 --> 19:14.000]  We need you to help fight extremism. And really what they're doing is they're getting a gaggle of patsies so they can have you go on board a plane to do a drill.
[19:14.000 --> 19:21.000]  They're going to blow that plane out of the sky and you're going to be all over the news. And your parents will come out and say, you know,
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  Ahmed was recruited out of college to join the CIA and the media is just going to laugh at you.
[19:26.000 --> 19:34.000]  And it won't matter, you know, if their college buddy comes out and says, no, you know, Ahmed was recruited in the CIA three years ago.
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  Well, his roommate's going to walk out and be hit by a car that day.
[19:38.000 --> 19:44.000]  I mean, that's how they roll. They roll that way.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  And I know it's fun to be scared of the terrorists and hide under your table all day.
[19:48.000 --> 19:56.000]  But no one can deny in former Homeland Security head Governor Ridge admitted two years ago that he was ordered to issue fake terror alerts for political purposes.
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  So regardless of what you think is an inside job, they're using to take our freedoms.

[20:39.000 --> 20:46.000]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[22:59.000 --> 23:05.000]  Question. Can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[23:05.000 --> 23:26.000]  Author Jose Calazzo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery. For more than 13 years, author Jose Calazzo has been trying to prove that the U.S. government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology known as fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging.
[23:26.000 --> 23:41.000]  And there is proof that it exists. America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security. Who has access to it? How is it being used? Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[23:41.000 --> 24:00.000]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery. The new books by Jose Calazzo. Available on bn.com, amazon.com, and borders.com. America's New Slavery. All Americans should be concerned.
[24:00.000 --> 24:23.000]  Yeah, that's right. Bombshell. Saudi and U.S. governments protected hijackers. That's from 9-11 Commissioner Bob Graham. But that's always been known. They were trained at U.S. military bases. They were protected.
[24:23.000 --> 24:35.000]  The U.S. embassies when they were coming back into the U.S. were told in Saudi Arabia, these men worked for the CIA, let them back in. They're in the terror files as their political cover.
[24:35.000 --> 24:54.000]  Yeah, they're at the topless bars. They're partying. They're got Mossad and FBI paying for their credit cards in San Diego and renting them their houses. But I know 9-11 wasn't an inside job. I understand.
[24:54.000 --> 25:06.000]  There's just all the videos of cops saying, get back. They're going to blow up Building 7. And BBC cuts to Building 7 as it stands and says, Building 7 is falling from fires into its own footprint. 25 minutes before it fell.
[25:06.000 --> 25:19.000]  Oops, we got that little memo early. Oh, there it goes. Yes. Yes. Oh, and the government didn't ship tens of thousands of guns into Mexico to the crime cartels to then blame the Second Amendment.
[25:19.000 --> 25:29.000]  Oh, and they don't care that they've been caught. They don't care they've been caught. They went ahead and announced the new gun control, that the executive orders are coming to restrict the Second Amendment.
[25:29.000 --> 25:41.000]  Outside of law, the president just says so. And the ATF's got new rules for gun shops. There's no law, but they say so. And don't look for Republicans to point this out.
[25:41.000 --> 25:55.000]  No, they're going to say, how dare you ship the guns in? How dare you do this? Oh, and then lie about it. Lie to Congress and say they didn't. Even when holders caught lying, they're like, well, we better leave this alone because they got dirt on us.
[25:55.000 --> 26:07.000]  You notice Bill Clinton was protected by George Bush. Obama's protecting George W. Bush on the torture and all the rest of it because they all work for the same interest at the end of the day.
[26:07.000 --> 26:28.000]  And I want to get to this news item. Yesterday, Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, came out with a letter to the president proposing that the power of the purse, Article 1, Section 7 and 8 of the Constitution, be transferred entirely to the president.
[26:28.000 --> 26:39.000]  And they sold this like, ooh, that's a skillful political move. We'll let him do it and get us more into debt and bankrupt us. And then we'll blame him. Like winning political points is what matters.
[26:39.000 --> 26:49.000]  And that's only for the camp follower Republicans that feel like they're big political analysts and smart. No, this is the ongoing agenda to transfer power into the executive.
[26:49.000 --> 27:02.000]  What did we see Republicans and Democrats do under Bill Clinton? Sign most of Congress's authority over to the private World Trade Organization over our trade, 1996.
[27:02.000 --> 27:13.000]  What did we see with the Glass-Steagall sign over all power to the banks to control and the Federal Reserve to control the issuance of currency and credit?
[27:13.000 --> 27:21.000]  And that happened to a certain extent in 1913, but the full transference with the Glass-Steagall and other acts that were gotten rid of in 1998, 1999.
[27:21.000 --> 27:29.000]  So it's this continued transference. These guys are there as traders treasonous. And I'm not just using those words. That's what it is.
[27:29.000 --> 27:44.000]  The transfer, the power of the Congress, the lawmakers. Well, Obama is the lawmaker now. Congress are the war makers, the lawmakers, the tax raisers, the deciders on debt.
[27:44.000 --> 28:01.000]  And in case you don't believe me, I'm now going to read from the archaic Constitution that, you know, that thing that we've seen the last few months, every major publication, including the statesman here in Austin, saying it's time to get rid of that Constitution.
[28:01.000 --> 28:10.000]  Yeah, private property due process, checks and balances, separation of power. Yeah, that's why we need states, why we need a Congress, why we need courts?
[28:10.000 --> 28:24.000]  Because we've got an imperial presidency. And again, the media will say, Jones claims Obama will be a dictator. No. The office is becoming a dictatorship of the bureaucracy and the special interests that own it and run it.
[28:24.000 --> 28:35.000]  And whose alumni sit in all the positions of power and regulatory authority. It's fully made up of these corporate, non-free market pirates.
[28:35.000 --> 28:44.000]  Article 1, Section 7 deals with spending bills arising in the House, going to the Senate for the power of levying taxes, debts, things like that.
[28:44.000 --> 28:58.000]  Now, Section 8 gets even more specific. The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposed and excises to pay the debts, the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.
[28:58.000 --> 29:11.000]  But all duties, imposed and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States. Yeah, how about Obama's forced healthcare, which is a tax, and he gives his buddies waivers. That's not uniform, is it? No.
[29:11.000 --> 29:22.000]  To borrow money on the credit of the United States. And of course, borrowing money. See, a president could be bought off by a foreign power. That happened a lot in Europe with kings and princes and even elected leaders.
[29:22.000 --> 29:37.000]  So they go on to say the president can't sign deals getting us into debt. The president can't raise debt ceilings. And it says to regulate commerce with foreign nations in among the several states and with the Indian tribes, establish a uniform rule of naturalization.
[29:37.000 --> 29:50.000]  And it goes in to say that they control the coinage, the issuance of weights and measures, currencies that the Congress is the boss of the military of everything. But they teach the military that the president's the boss.
[29:50.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[31:00.000 --> 31:08.000]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[31:08.000 --> 31:16.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[31:16.000 --> 31:28.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[31:28.000 --> 31:39.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[31:39.000 --> 31:47.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[32:00.000 --> 32:09.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:09.000 --> 32:20.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[32:20.000 --> 32:29.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:29.000 --> 32:36.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[32:36.000 --> 32:46.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[32:46.000 --> 33:07.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:17.000 --> 33:19.000]  Well, so does he.
[33:19.000 --> 33:26.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:26.000 --> 33:49.000]  Okay, so finishing up on the latest bit of treason, as the Congress, the lawmakers, the tax authorities transfer or attempt to transfer whatever power they've got left illegally to the president.
[33:49.000 --> 34:10.000]  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell floated a novel way out of the default Tuesday, suggesting that Congress give up its power to raise the debt ceiling and instead effectively transfer that authority and the political pain that comes with it to the White House for the remainder of Obama's current term.
[34:10.000 --> 34:32.000]  But then they quote rather Republicans here in these articles saying the proposal is not only likely unconstitutional, it is the worst possible strategy for Republicans who promised to fight the debt to now instead give the president unilateral power to borrow to his heart's content.
[34:32.000 --> 34:46.000]  The McConnell plan is full surrender the white flag approach, and that is exactly what it is. Mitch McConnell, that I hear conservatives hailing constantly, makes me want to throw up.
[34:46.000 --> 34:55.000]  Yeah, why not give the World Trade Organization the authority over our trade? Why not let the president launch wars if he wants to without getting authorization from Congress?
[34:55.000 --> 35:05.000]  I mean, where is Congress blocking Obama having the EPA go around and shut down all of General Electric's competition in coal power plants?
[35:05.000 --> 35:13.000]  Headline three months ago, Secretary of Energy, we're going to shut down massive amounts of coal plants.
[35:13.000 --> 35:29.000]  Headline the same day, Wall Street Journal, Obama signs waivers for General Electric. Obama issues waivers to McDonald's and over 2,000 other firms that don't have to buy insurance for their employees, but I'm not exempt.
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.000]  These rules are going in this year.
[35:32.000 --> 35:39.000]  Think about that, separate from whether the health care law is legitimate or not, obviously it isn't.
[35:39.000 --> 35:52.000]  And I know I harp on this out of everything, almost every day, because folks, this is a new level of open corruption where all of the president's contributors are exempt from the garbage they bring down on us.
[35:52.000 --> 36:00.000]  That is dictatorship. If you study the Nazis, that is exactly what went on under Hitler. It's corporate fascism.
[36:00.000 --> 36:13.000]  They would pass all these regulations and then Nazi companies were exempt, and in just a few years there were no companies but Nazi companies.
[36:13.000 --> 36:28.000]  That's the type of system we're going under, and it is so mind boggling. People think of discrimination as only, well, I'm white and I was discriminated by black people, or I'm black, I was discriminated by white people, or I'm Hispanic, I was discriminated against by black people or white people.
[36:28.000 --> 36:35.000]  No, no, no, no, no. See, they distract you with all of that and obsess over it all day, and certainly some of that goes on.
[36:35.000 --> 36:45.000]  The main issue is, back in the news today, two years running, General Electric has paid zero taxes and made giant profits.
[36:45.000 --> 36:53.000]  Google pays 2.4. I was seeing numbers of Berkshire Hathaway paying less than 5%.
[36:53.000 --> 37:08.000]  And then meanwhile, constantly in the news, I've got Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and Oprah Winfrey, who they admit, quote, have secret meetings to discuss how to reduce population, source on that, Times of London,
[37:08.000 --> 37:18.000]  lecturing that, oh, you know, telling their audience rich people don't pay enough tax, raise taxes, and the taxes they promote are on people making $125,000 a year.
[37:18.000 --> 37:27.000]  Folks, that isn't rich. The middle class is so important because that's the group that gets their hair done. That's the group that buys cars and clothes and goes to your hotel.
[37:27.000 --> 37:36.000]  That's the group that has a local business and sponsors your radio station. That's the group in the million plus small businesses that still run everything.
[37:36.000 --> 37:43.000]  We're now a service economy. The middle class is always important. In a service economy, it's all we've got.
[37:43.000 --> 37:58.000]  And now under Bush and under Obama, we've had the head of the Small Business League on. They are giving almost none of, under federal law, the federal contracts to small businesses, even though under law they're supposed to.
[37:58.000 --> 38:09.000]  And it turns out there's a secret blacklist where small companies, and I'm talking about companies worth $100 million, that's considered small, cannot get government contracts.
[38:09.000 --> 38:21.000]  I mean, if we're going to have this system, shouldn't American companies, shouldn't small businesses get it? No, the big mega offshore corporations get it because they set up the system.
[38:21.000 --> 38:30.000]  They don't pay taxes. They get the government contracts. It's corporate welfare. And that's what I want to see cut. That's what I want to see fixed.
[38:30.000 --> 38:40.000]  And you're not going to hear the stinking Republicans tell you about it and you're not going to hear the stinking Democrats talk about it because they're on the same team at the top.
[38:40.000 --> 38:48.000]  They're talking about cutting welfare. You know what's going to happen because we're already in this dependent mode. I was against it. I am still against it.
[38:48.000 --> 39:06.000]  You know what's going to happen if they kick the 49 and a half million? Every few months it goes up by another million. Within a month it's going to be 50 million people on full bore food stamps, the little credit cards administered by Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.
[39:06.000 --> 39:17.000]  Oh yeah, they make money on that as well. You know what happened if 50 million people didn't have their soup line, their high tech 21st century soup line?
[39:17.000 --> 39:33.000]  The cities, every actuary study and government study have shown will burn within five days, which is exactly where they want us because now if you don't give the bankers the trillions they want every month and quote bail out that are really robbery,
[39:33.000 --> 39:41.000]  they've gotten government to sign on to their too big to fail to their Ponzi scheme that they made money on the front end with. Now they make money on the back end with.
[39:41.000 --> 39:50.000]  They're going to pull the plug completely on the economy and they threatened it in Europe. They threatened total depression and martial law just two weeks ago in Greece. They threatened it three years ago here.
[39:50.000 --> 40:02.000]  And now they're threatening it again if we don't do everything they say. So instead we just slowly collapse instead of fully collapsing at once, which would be better because it would collapse them.
[40:02.000 --> 40:17.000]  So there's no easy way out on this, but it goes bad to worse. Now, what is Obama saying? He says if you don't raise that debt ceiling, I may not be able to send your social security checks out, which again they sell as an entitlement because they stole the money.
[40:17.000 --> 40:27.000]  If you put it in a guaranteed investment of 5%, you get on average double the money after 30 years of working. That money's been gone for 50 years. It hadn't been in there.
[40:27.000 --> 40:41.000]  It was leveraged and spent before it ever went in. So now they're going to have all these people on fixed incomes who are going to do whatever the government says and they're going to support us going deeper into Banana Republic debt because they got to get their social security check.
[40:41.000 --> 40:52.000]  And down the road, you're not going to get your social security check. Oh, you'll still get it in the mail, but it won't buy anything just like a Deutsche Mark in 1932 wouldn't buy anything.
[40:52.000 --> 41:02.000]  A million of them wouldn't buy a piece of bread. 10 million wouldn't buy a loaf by the end of it. They are destroying the value of it.
[41:02.000 --> 41:15.000]  So you're already not getting your social security check. Everyone I know who has parents who are living on social security, 80, 85, 90 year old people I know that live at home.
[41:15.000 --> 41:33.000]  And if family wasn't giving them money, they'd be on the street or they'd be in some government run nursing home, which further bankrupts the society because their social security will not pay for Jack squat and it's only begun.
[41:33.000 --> 41:45.000]  So they're always going to dangle that check. Oh, look, we frozen for two years, the cola, the cost of living increase. There's no inflation because the government says so we fix the numbers and everything's fine.
[41:45.000 --> 41:54.000]  And by the way, the Libya war is not a war. And by the way, the president can do it every once. And by the way, he's going to take your guns with executive orders he's announced, but it's no big deal.
[41:54.000 --> 42:09.000]  Mr. McConnell says it's okay. And so they'll dangle these social security checks and the welfare and the loan star cards and the welfare cards in front of you.
[42:09.000 --> 42:17.000]  But it's not going to matter. It's not going to matter because you're not going to be able to buy as much with it. You're already having the check basically cut in half.
[42:17.000 --> 42:28.000]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Obama, Barry Sataro, basically engaging in financial terrorism, saying, hey, that's right, you don't go deeper into debt with the bankers, you won't get your money.
[42:28.000 --> 42:36.000]  Instead of saying, yeah, we can still pay our social security, we're writing off the thousand point five quadrillion that's impossible to pay.
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  You could pay hundreds and hundreds of times all the wealth in the world. This is admitted. This is even in mainstream news.
[42:41.000 --> 42:50.000]  The end of the derivatives and it wouldn't pay it off. You could pay Jim Rogers talks about this. They all talk about it.
[42:50.000 --> 42:57.000]  John Williams talks about it. Top economist. You could pay everything in hundreds and hundreds of times. It wouldn't pay it off.
[42:57.000 --> 43:09.000]  And notice they've bankrupted Spain, Portugal, Italy, all these countries, Greece, Ireland, and every time they have a quote bailout, which is, hey, we're too big to fail.
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  Give us hundreds of billions or we'll implode everything. We won't loan your government more money.
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  Well, you're even in more debt than our government. Doesn't matter. Loan us more money.
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.000]  Okay, you gave us the money. Now we'll loan it back to you at interest, to the government and you individually.
[43:22.000 --> 43:28.000]  And then every time, just give us one more bailout and everything will be fixed. Okay, here's the bailout. Europe's even more spiraling out of control, spreading everywhere.
[43:28.000 --> 43:34.000]  Give us even more money. We'll fix it. Okay, here's more. Oh my gosh, it's even worse. It's horrible. Give us even more. Okay, here's even more.
[43:34.000 --> 43:42.000]  Oh my gosh, everything's even more horrible. Everything's imploding. Oh my gosh. Now we need to take the private pension funds in Europe. Okay, here's part of our private pension fund. Just fix it.
[43:42.000 --> 43:54.000]  Now in Europe, in Greece and Ireland, they're openly moving to take your private pension fund that the governments of Europe made you for 50 years put in to these private funds.
[43:54.000 --> 44:00.000]  And now they're saying, well, we're going to take part of that. But if we don't take part of it, the whole thing will be lost. Okay, here's part of it.
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.000]  Oh my gosh, things are even worse. We've got to take even more. Okay, take more. And pretty soon you have nothing.
[44:05.000 --> 44:13.000]  And through currency devaluation on top of the stealing, you end up with nothing. But they've played this incremental, rope-a-dope game with you.
[44:13.000 --> 44:26.000]  And yeah, I'm yelling and screaming. Folks, I feel like I'm living in the twilight zone. I can't believe what's going on anymore. I can't believe that the president is announcing he's going to sign an executive order
[44:26.000 --> 44:35.000]  and put you on a no buy list with no criminal record and no proof and you can't get off the list. And they're just ordering gun shops now outside of law with what to do.
[44:35.000 --> 44:47.000]  I mean, this is called one word, dictatorship. Let me say it again. Dictatorship. Dictatorship. Dictatorship. Dictating. You know what a secretary does? She dictates.
[44:47.000 --> 45:02.000]  You dictate to her and she writes it. I dictate. The word dictate means when the emperor or the pharaoh would stand up and give law, it would be chiseled into stone and put out publicly.
[45:02.000 --> 45:18.000]  I am dictating to you. I am your dictator. You are taking dictation. You are doing what the dictator says. I'm your boss secretary. Type this out. I'm your boss America.
[45:18.000 --> 45:25.000]  Do what I say. Obama said two days ago, eat your peas like your little kid. They always talk to us in this fatherly way, like they're our boss. They're our owner.
[45:25.000 --> 45:33.000]  If you notice, everything's childlike. We're the children. The states are loving mommy and daddy and the police are our big brother. Well, let me tell you something, police, everybody else.
[45:33.000 --> 45:42.000]  They're stealing your dollar value. They're going to take your pension funds too. We're all in this together. And if you keep mine under their false narrative, we have no future.
[45:42.000 --> 45:55.000]  Now, here is the clip of Obama and the Obamanoids holding old people hostage knowing full well they're going to steal every bit of their paycheck in the end through inflation. Here it is.
[45:55.000 --> 46:01.000]  Can you tell the folks at home that no matter what happens?
[46:01.000 --> 46:12.000]  Sometimes the computers, that's why we're going to replace them, play them slow. We are going to replace those computers. We're going to try to play this. There's got to be better computers than this. It's got to happen.
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  We're ready with the clip now. Here it is.
[46:15.000 --> 46:28.000]  Can you tell the folks at home that no matter what happens, the social security checks are going to go out on August the 3rd. They're about $20 billion worth of social security checks that have to go out the day after the government is supposedly going to go into default.
[46:28.000 --> 46:39.000]  Well, this is not just a matter of social security checks. These are veterans checks. These are folks on disability and their checks. They're about 70 million checks that go out.
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  Can you guarantee as president those checks will go out on August the 3rd?
[46:43.000 --> 46:54.000]  I cannot guarantee that those checks go out on August 3rd if we haven't resolved this issue because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it.
[46:54.000 --> 47:03.000]  Alright, that's CBS Propaganda News. Now, let's go over this here briefly.
[47:03.000 --> 47:12.000]  We got just shy of 50 million, 49 plus million people and growing on food stamps.
[47:12.000 --> 47:20.000]  There's another 40 million or so on some other form of assistance, so that's 90 million. Let's be conservative, 80 million.
[47:20.000 --> 47:30.000]  You got 70 million people on social security, so what's 70 million and 70 million? That's 140 million.
[47:30.000 --> 47:38.000]  So that's close to half the population of the country. There's 310 million people here and another 30 million illegal aliens, most of them on welfare, on top of their paychecks.
[47:38.000 --> 47:48.000]  That's the big dirty secret. So we got 330 million people here and we got 140 million of them openly on government assistance.
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.000]  Okay? You're like, well, I pay for that social security. Regardless, you're dependent on government.
[47:53.000 --> 48:02.000]  Okay? Which is run by foreign ruthless banks that have imploded countries hundreds of times in the last century and are experts on how to socially engineer this and how to control everything.
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.000]  They put the police state in place. It didn't for Al Qaeda. Let me give you a news flash. We got their own training manuals. It's for you.
[48:08.000 --> 48:19.000]  So then you've got of the fortune 500, most of them dependent on government contracts and you've got individuals on government contracts or private companies that are on government contracts.
[48:19.000 --> 48:28.000]  I mean, do the math. 140 million on some type of welfare. That leaves 160, 170 million people that aren't.
[48:28.000 --> 48:41.000]  Most of them are in some form run a government contract. I've seen some numbers that it's as low as 50 million people in this country who aren't on some type of government dole or who aren't dependent on government.
[48:41.000 --> 48:50.000]  And remember out of those 50 million, a lot of them are children. I mean, this country is so, well, they got a word for it.
[48:50.000 --> 49:02.000]  We are living in a world of hurt and we've been maneuvered into this position and now they're going to hold this hostage every year or two with another bail out with higher taxes with more austerity.
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  And the more they cut services, the more they increase the water price, the more they cut cops.
[49:07.000 --> 49:13.000]  I've seen cases where they fire 60 plus percent of the sheriff's deputies and the sheriff says, I'm sorry.
[49:13.000 --> 49:21.000]  The county has told us to just be revenue generators now to pay our own checks. We're not going to respond to crime by guns.
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  Here's 35 crimes we're not going to respond to, including home invasion by guns.
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  And at least those sheriffs and police chiefs have been honest.
[49:29.000 --> 49:42.000]  You look at Chicago and crime havens like that. They say you can't own a gun. But by the way, we're not going to respond to crime.
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  Do you realize how hardcore this is? We're in a depression.
[49:46.000 --> 49:53.000]  Now Geithner, the head of the Treasury, calls it on meat depress. What do you call it? The Great Recession.
[49:53.000 --> 50:01.000]  But wait a minute. They told us the recession ended in March. No, no, in June of 2009. So two years ago, it ended.
[50:01.000 --> 50:11.000]  I mean, there was, oh, but now he said it's going to be the most painful thing that many of us have ever seen and it's going to go on for a long time.
[50:11.000 --> 50:19.000]  Remember? That's the quote. I played it yesterday. Can we cue up Geithner? I'm going to play that exact quote when we come back.
[50:19.000 --> 50:26.000]  Thank you. So this is the reality of what we're facing.
[50:26.000 --> 50:35.000]  And, you know, I'm the extremist. 15 years ago, I had medical doctors on reading studies that were from a decade before that,
[50:35.000 --> 50:41.000]  that they knew cell phones and rat studies were causing big fat brain tumors and lowering fertility.
[50:41.000 --> 50:51.000]  And here is a whole bunch of mainline university studies, cell phones, cancer and fertility, studies in the U.S., Europe, Australia, all fine,
[50:51.000 --> 51:00.000]  doubling of brain tumors, doubling and massive destruction of DNA and sperm. But so what?
[51:00.000 --> 51:07.000]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[51:07.000 --> 51:12.000]  That's easy, Bill. I've head straight to soupbeansurvival.com.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  Soupbeansurvival.com?
[51:14.000 --> 51:24.000]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.000]  Really, Brian? The number one survival food? Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.

[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[51:43.000 --> 51:50.000]  No way, Bill. You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store. These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.
[51:50.000 --> 52:00.000]  Visit soupbeansurvival.com. That's soupbeansurvival.com for all the information you're going to need for nature's super survival food.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[52:04.000 --> 52:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[52:14.000 --> 52:20.000]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[52:32.000 --> 52:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[52:35.000 --> 52:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[52:40.000 --> 52:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[52:45.000 --> 52:51.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[52:51.000 --> 52:59.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[52:59.000 --> 53:05.000]  We don't need to convince you that the threat of forced entry is on the rise and that your door locks are inadequate.
[53:05.000 --> 53:10.000]  Now you can virtually eliminate the threat of your door being kicked in with the door sentinel.
[53:10.000 --> 53:16.000]  The door sentinel offers standalone door kick-in protection for under $67 and installs in minutes on any door.

[53:29.000 --> 53:34.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold,
[53:34.000 --> 53:41.000]  IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[53:44.000 --> 53:49.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[53:49.000 --> 53:55.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[53:55.000 --> 54:15.000]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[54:15.000 --> 54:21.000]  By the way, this happened a couple days ago, and I kept waiting to see the national media cover it, but they didn't.
[54:21.000 --> 54:35.000]  Ron Paul in the key battleground state of New Hampshire in a straw poll garnered 39% of the vote, absolutely trouncing all other competition.
[54:35.000 --> 54:42.000]  Rick Santorum got 12%, Michelle Bachman even less with 11%, Romney got 9%.
[54:42.000 --> 54:51.000]  But it doesn't matter, the establishment is going to force feed us, Romney and Michelle Bachman, the former IRS tax collector.
[54:51.000 --> 55:01.000]  Continuing here, this is a clip again of Geithner saying this is going to be for many Americans the toughest time in their life,
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  and it's going to go on for a long time. Here's the clip from Meet the Press.
[55:05.000 --> 55:10.000]  Well, I think it's going to take a long time still. This is a very tough economy, and I think for a lot of people,
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.000]  it's going to feel very hard, harder than anything they've experienced in a lifetime now for some time to come.
[55:15.000 --> 55:26.000]  But that is because that is the tragic effects of a crisis this deep in this bad caused by a long period of lost opportunities to do things to make the country stronger.
[55:26.000 --> 55:33.000]  Alright, let's stop there. These are the guys that got rid of Glass-Steagall that created the derivatives that signed us on to it that authored all of this,
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  and they're telling us that it's because we haven't done everything they've told us to do that we're going to have this problem.
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  And the head of General Electric who heads up the Winehouse Economic Council is saying,
[55:42.000 --> 55:48.000]  we need to get regulations off businesses. He's the guy in there recommending the regulations to shut down his competition,
[55:48.000 --> 55:55.000]  but then he gives speeches about getting rid of regulations. They say zig, they zag, they say black, it's white, they say up, it's down.
[55:55.000 --> 56:03.000]  They say the sky is red, you know it's blue. They say they didn't ship those guns into Mexico, you know you did it, they've been caught lying again.
[56:03.000 --> 56:10.000]  These are crooks. Time to grow up. We're in their clutches. I want to bring Ted Anderson up in this segment in the next little short one,
[56:10.000 --> 56:16.000]  then we've got a big guest coming up in the next hour. Ted, the owner of the Genesis Network that I've been on for more than 14 years now.
[56:16.000 --> 56:25.000]  Ted Anderson, of course, also the owner of Midas Resources now, what, the fifth or is it the fourth now largest gold and silver company in the nation?
[56:25.000 --> 56:31.000]  That's a great free market story. He buys gold and silver when it's low, sells it to you when it's high at the old low price.
[56:31.000 --> 56:41.000]  Gold now at an all-time global high, right up there at what, 1,590 smackers. Silver surging in the middle of the summer, normally a doldrum.
[56:41.000 --> 56:50.000]  Can you imagine the fall? If that sounds high now, folks, there's global devaluation of all currencies. The laws of economics say it will only go up.
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  They can play games and drive it down for a period. That's when you should get in and buy it.
[56:54.000 --> 57:03.000]  But since you didn't listen, you can now get in a time machine with Ted Anderson and go back and get gold and silver he bought months ago during the dip, even though it's now high.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  You can't beat that. Ted Anderson, what do you make of gold at an all-time high?
[57:06.000 --> 57:14.000]  Well, it's very surprising to see it here in July, but I guess not when you look at the economy and what's going on in Europe and here in the United States.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  I mean, you're playing Ben Bernanke's thing. I was looking at Reuters and his comments and it's just amazing.
[57:20.000 --> 57:26.000]  Talking about QE3 now. Yeah, they said they wouldn't do QE3, so you know they will.
[57:26.000 --> 57:32.000]  And now he's gone back on that as well, which means further dollar devaluation, total hyperinflation.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  Ted, you've got a whole list of gold and silver that you bought months ago.
[57:35.000 --> 57:40.000]  It's radio specials. Folks should say Alex Jones radio specials when they call.
[57:40.000 --> 57:48.000]  I want to talk a little bit more about this on the other side, but the number to call, folks, is 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[57:48.000 --> 57:59.000]  I just want to add, Ted, you've got the American Dream animated film that's top notch free that breaks down the history of the banking cartel takeover and how to beat them.
[57:59.000 --> 58:04.000]  Mark Dice's new, thick, lavish book, Big Brother, Your Welly and Nightmare Come True.
[58:04.000 --> 58:09.000]  Both of those free when you buy two silver dollars at a price that's now below market.
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.000]  So you buy a great deal on silver dollars, you get a free film and a free book.
[58:13.000 --> 58:18.000]  Ted wants to introduce you to this and he wants you to get this film out to everybody and the book.
[58:18.000 --> 58:23.000]  Read it yourself and pay it forward, 800-686-2237.
[58:23.000 --> 58:32.000]  Tell them they'll read you a list of the gold and silver coins that will take you back in time months ago, but Ted is in danger of running out of that and his prices will go up.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  We'll briefly tell you some of those smoking prices on the other side.
[58:35.000 --> 58:44.000]  Then we'll get into where Ted sees the markets going, then we've got a guest joining us. You don't want to miss it.
[58:44.000 --> 58:51.000]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.000 --> 58:59.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[58:59.000 --> 59:05.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[59:05.000 --> 59:11.000]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[59:11.000 --> 59:16.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[59:19.000 --> 59:26.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[59:26.000 --> 59:32.000]  The Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[59:32.000 --> 59:39.000]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[59:39.000 --> 59:44.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[59:44.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  We've got anti-terror specialist researcher Tony Ferrell served in Britain's South Yorkshire Police for 12 years as police intelligence analyst.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  It was Ferrell's job to produce annual strategic threat assessment matrix reports and he discovered that the evidence pointed towards government sponsored terror and was let go.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  He'll be joining us coming up in light of the bombshells, Saudis and U.S. government protected hijackers.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  That's coming up and we have some also special guests in studio.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  Great activist, take calls then as well.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  Got a lot of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  But going back to Ted Anderson, so Ted, gold now at an all time high.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  We're going right up to 1590 smackers, silver surging as well today, right up close to 39.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  This is amazing, but really it isn't amazing when you understand that this is what happens when you have dollar devaluation.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  We have seen way too much printing of currency and it's competing with the money that's out there and it's just pushing the value of gold and silver up.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  And it's not just happening here in the United States, it's happening in Europe and it's happening all over the place.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  I was watching the Asian markets this morning long before the U.S. market opened and that was going up all night long.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  And here we are sitting here today watching the market do the same thing in New York.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  Obviously the word is out there and the United States is the dollars in trouble.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  We've printed way too much currency.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  You're talking about items that I have, you know, I mean the eagle right now is sitting at 1698-92.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  I have, you know, the palladium bars.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  I have Mexican pesos.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  I have one ounce maple leaves.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  I have coronas.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  I have platinum eagles.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  I have Australian nugget gold coins.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  I've got quarter ounce Krugerans, you know, quarter ounce silver bars.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  We have just a whole long line of various different things.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  You know, the premiums have gone up so far on the bullion coins that I even think that you should be buying the real circulated $20 gold pieces at this point.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  Just due to the fact that everybody's ignored those now and they're just sitting there right next to what it costs to pay to buy a U.S. eagle.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  So, I mean, it's just, there's such a long line of stuff that you can get into.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  But this is, you got to remember, this is July, Alex.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  We're sitting right next to August, September, October.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  That's when the market gets hot.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  And if it's heating up this much in August, the prices that we're going to pay in this fall, you know, it's going to be through the roof, you know.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  Absolutely.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  So, there's a long list of things that are on the sheet that are the special 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  I'll go back, folks, to telling you to buy silver when it was $5 an ounce 10 years ago, telling you to buy gold when it was $360 an ounce.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  And then every time they play the game, make it dip by $100 on gold or $10 on silver.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  People say, are you going to sell yours?
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  No, I'm not.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  I'm going to buy more because they're globally devaluing currencies.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  Gold and silver is denominated in those currencies.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  The gold and silver isn't going up.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  The currencies are going down.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  And so, what you're doing is dodging inflation with these moves.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  You would have had a four-fold increase if you bought gold 10 years ago, a seven-fold increase in silver when it was up at 50, right at 50, 10-fold.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  The point is, it is now time to get involved in gold and silver.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  Ted, I know that the stuff you've got from what about a month, a month and a half ago, how long are you going to be able to have these specials you've got right now before prices go up?
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  Well, Alex, I know that today is going to be a hot day. It could be over by the days and just due to the fact that the prices are going up like they are, people are going to be calling and buying.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  I hope to carry it through further. We'll have to see.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  All right, 800-686-2237.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  And how much is it to get the American Dream film along with the Big Brother book?
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  You get the two silver dollars and you get those free. How much is that?
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  I'm still holding that at $75 delivered. I can tell you right now, you can't buy two silver dollars at $75, so that is a...
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  So it's free delivery, the free film and the free book. This is a big loss, leader, folks.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  This is to get you introduced to the silver and gold. Ted does these specials only on this radio transmission.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  And I can't tell you, that's the best deal you'll find anywhere.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  I certify it, but your common sense certifies it.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  800-686-2337.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  I feel really good and sleep really good at night, being able to offer you deals like that.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  So please take advantage of it. 800-686-2337. Thank you, Ted.

[01:05:53.800 --> 01:06:16.600]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:28.200]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:38.900]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:07:00.900]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.

[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:37.900]  Okay, I want to preface before we go to our guest here with just some basic history. In mainline Roman history, and you learn that Julius Caesar's family actually got political power through this over several generations, fire departments were set up in the big city of Rome.
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:49.900]  And if your neighborhood did not pay them the fire department fee, they would set fires and burn down your neighborhood. And over time, it grew into a protection racket.
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:09:11.900]  The Sicilian mafia in the last 200 years in Italy and the United States, in places like New York and Boston and other places, didn't invent coming to your grocery store or your laundry or your restaurant or your church and saying, you need to pay us protection money or somebody's going to burn down your grocery store.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:27.900]  I'm not saying who's going to do it, but if you pay me a little protection money and hire my cousin, he'll watch out and make sure nobody burns down your grocery store. And of course, it's the cousin smiling at you from behind the capo that's going to burn down your grocery store.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:45.900]  There was a case of this in New York, I don't know, it was a decade ago, I got a lot of attention so I use it as an example, where somebody with ball peen hammers knocked out hundreds of car windows for years. And folks noticed that there were billboards everywhere for a company that had shops all over the areas that would fix your windshield for the lowest price.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:55.900]  And finally, it was discovered one of the workers blew the whistle that he had upwards of eight people going out every night, knocking dings and windshields with ball peen hammer.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:05.900]  Now, that's a false flag business attack. There's been a lot of evidence that major virus companies are hiring hackers to release viruses that they then already have the fix to.
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:23.900]  I mean, this really is common sense governments in the West the last 100 years have made drugs illegal, because the big powerful interest control the drugs being brought in. Now they can shut down their competition with the law they've bought off, and they can make larger profits because it's now a black market item.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:37.900]  This is all really just cause and effect common sense Hitler firebombing his own Reichstag that's now been released and confirmed Hitler blowing up his own military base blaming it on the polls to attack Poland.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:48.900]  And so look the polls attacked our base our communications base. They even dressed up prisoners and shot him in Polish uniforms and German uniforms to show newsreels of dead bodies. That's how World War two started.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:56.900]  That's publicly admitted. So the point is, you know, governments do this, you know, go for talking with stage to get us into Vietnam saying our ships were attacked.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:02.900]  They said it was a conspiracy theory for 40 years from the 40th anniversary. The CIA declassified they staged it.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:11.900]  We already knew because officers on the ships came back and reported no, we weren't attacked. That was in the San Diego paper back in 64.
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:22.900]  But it becomes a rumor, a legend. People heard it was staged. Well, later it came out it was staged. And there's Operation Gladio over 200 U.S. bombings carried out with NATO in Europe.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:31.900]  Their favorite thing was to blow up school buses because that really got folks upset and they would grab a Patsy, shoot him in the head and say that, you know, they had to commit the bombing of the school bus.
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:38.900]  So it's time to grow up. The Russians do it. The Tsars did it before the communists. Every major government does this.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:49.900]  And the argument the Pentagon is, others are doing it, we got to do it. You got Operation Northwoods where the Pentagon proposed to Kennedy to blow up D.C.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:58.900]  Bomb Miami, hijacked Jets by remote control, crash them, blame it on the Russians, start World War III. Kennedy said no, and they said, well, then we're going to just take you out.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:10.900]  Now, all of that goes on. All of that is happening. And, you know, I've talked a lot about this because it was in Newsweek. It was in major newspapers that the hijackers were trained at U.S. bases.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:18.900]  And it came out but was never discussed again. And the head of the Defense Language School, Colonel Butler, went public and said, some of these guys were at our school.
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:25.900]  I recognized them. Something's going on. The government's behind this. And then they started a court martial against him and he shut up and they dropped the court martial.
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:35.900]  So all of that said, I wanted to play this clip before we go to our guest from England for the rest of the hour and we appreciate his courage in going public and losing his job over this.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:43.900]  And I actually have some of the local papers that reported on it here. But bombshells, Saudi and U.S. government protected hijackers.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:50.900]  And of course, I mean, who set up Al Qaeda? Saudi Arabia, the U.S., England, and Israel along with Pakistan intelligence in 1979.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:57.900]  Zbigniew Brzezinski has written two books in the last five years bragging about it. And it's the same groups working together.
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:02.900]  We've had Mr. Springman, the former head of the visa section of the embassy on where they were ordered.
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:07.900]  It's been in the Toronto Star. I had him on nine years ago, but I've had him on since.
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:16.900]  Mr. Springman talked to his colleagues. They were ordered to let Mohammed Atta and others back into the U.S. what, eight months before 9-11?
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:23.900]  Even though they were flagged as terrorists in their database and the CIA, when they wouldn't let him in, had the State Department call and say,
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.900]  look, they weren't for us. That's a cover.
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:34.900]  The underwear bomber under Secretary of State Kennedy admits they were ordered to help get him on the plane by an unnamed U.S. agency and to give them the visa.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:42.900]  We knew it a month and a half before because our listeners, lawyers, the Haskells, husband and wife lawyers were on and saw the guy being gotten on the plane,
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:47.900]  thought it was suspicious, didn't have his passport, saw the whole firecracker deal, right as they roll out.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:54.900]  I mean, it's all staged. Now, fast and furious, shipping guns in to the drug dealers to then blame on the Second Amendment.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:14:00.900]  Now, they've announced the gun control because of their own operation. It's happening. I mean, they know what they're doing.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:04.900]  And so it's time to grow up and realize this is happening.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:14.900]  Now, here is former Governor of Florida. Former Senator and Florida Governor Bob Graham said at least two of the purported 911 hijackers
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:20.900]  had assistance from Saudi Arabia. Graham's recently released novel Keys to the Kingdom implicates the Saudis.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:26.900]  He told MSNBC the novel is based on factual information. Let's go ahead and play that clip from MSNBC.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:38.900]  Well, just briefly, Thomas, there are some unquestioned facts that Saudi Arabia was providing significant assistance to at least two of the 19 hijackers living in San Diego.
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:46.900]  The questions are, why was Saudi Arabia doing this? Was it also providing assistance to the other 17 hijackers?
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:59.900]  And then why did the United States go to such lengths, including censuring the congressional inquiries report on the events leading up to 9-11 that related to the role of Saudi Arabia?
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:05.900]  So there are a lot of unanswered questions and Keys to the Kingdom starts with finding those answers.
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:10.900]  If you say that 40% of what's in this book is fact, I think that it's going to allow for avenues of discussion.
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:23.900]  Oh, that's good. All right, now we are going to our guest. Tony Pharrell served as a high-level intelligence analyst for South Yorkshire Police in Britain from 98 to 2010.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:32.900]  In the days preceding the fifth anniversary of the 7-7 bombings, Pharrell discovered the 9-11 attacks and 7-7 attacks were acts of state-sponsored terror.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:41.900]  And Sharon gave me a more detailed bio on him. He has a university degree in Applied Statistics Sheffield, Hallam University.
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:48.900]  I'm reading that right. Postgraduate degree in Criminal Intelligence, Analytics and Analysis, Manchester University.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:55.900]  Postgrad degree, Management Studies Sheffield. And we continue on from there, studying future threats.
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:16:04.900]  And he was the head of the South Yorkshire Police of their program to analyze terror attacks and threats.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:11.900]  And he joins us now, former intelligence analyst. And I have some of the news articles here dealing with it.
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:15.900]  Police intelligence analysts fired for blowing whistle on false flag.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:26.900]  Terror, Strategic Threat Assessment Matrix, concluded 7-7 was an inside job. Tony Pharrell is our guest going over that.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:34.900]  And we also have mainstream British reports where they admit that most of the IRA bombings were actually run by British intelligence and British Army officers,
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:40.900]  some of which we've interviewed here. One of them got killed after he was on the show, not trying to scare folks, just telling you this is not a game.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:44.900]  Mr. Pharrell, thank you for joining us and thank you for your courage.
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.900]  Thank you, Alex. And it's a pleasure to be on.
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:59.900]  So, tell us a little bit about yourself, your years of research and what brought you to going public with this information and what the police department thought when you brought them this information?
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:04.900]  Well, I've been working for the police service for the principal analyst since 1998.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:13.900]  I had a local government experience. It also worked for the regional government office, which is part of the home office, doing research into crime.
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:17.900]  So, I was quite experienced as a civilian. I wasn't the police officer.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:25.900]  And I was used to doing the strategic work. I wasn't privy to the detailed terrorist information from Special Branch,
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:30.900]  but I did take an overview of the sanitised versions and pulled them together in a strategic bet.
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:32.900]  That was my annual assignment.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:49.900]  And what happened, Alex, was that, as you say, a week ago, leading up to the 2010 July to 5th anniversary, I was merely going along with my assignment, believing that I was just going to be able to complete him without any problems.
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:18:02.900]  And, unfortunately, for me, running concurrently, was my home study that did the things like the history of geopolitics and what was going on in the world and the bit of church history.
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:15.900]  And all of a sudden, with a week ago, Alex had dropped on, through the likes of your program, the possibility of 9-11 being an inside job, that quickly triggered me to do a lot of research.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.900]  It had been hasty at home and hoping to get reassurance that that wouldn't be the case.
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:25.900]  And, unfortunately, as I could see, it was all damning evidence.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:30.900]  I panicked, though, into my church minister and said, what are we doing in this situation?
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:36.900]  And he just said, well, terrible, isn't it? Have you talked about checking out 7-7?
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.900]  Well, I thought, oh, dear, I'd better check that out, too.
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:43.900]  And now we're only talking to the three days to go before the assignment's due.
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:48.900]  So I took a day's annual leave and did everything possible.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:50.900]  Stayed awake for 24 hours.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.900]  That, too, wasn't looking before.
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:57.900]  It was so obvious, Alex, that it was an inside job as well.
[01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.900]  There's just damning information out there.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:09.900]  And that threw me in a problem, Alex, because I had to go to the, what we call the Intelligent Strategy Management Board on the 8th of July.
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:15.900]  And part of the assignment was a threat assessment that covered terrorism.
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:21.900]  And the component part would normally expect me to go along with all the government rhetoric and narrative on this,
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:27.900]  which would be to say that the threat, the large threat, was essentially from Islamic terrorism.
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:29.900]  Well, I'm sorry.
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:34.900]  If 9-11 was an inside job and 7-7 was an inside job,
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:43.900]  how could it possibly rely upon government rhetoric to actually say that it was Islamic terrorism, the biggest threat?
[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:47.900]  Alright, Mr. Ferrell, Mr. Ferrell, quick break, stay right there.
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.900]  Absolutely, these are the big attacks.
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:51.900]  These are causing the large numbers of death.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.900]  If that's an inside job, then you do the statistical analysis,
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:57.900]  then the government-sponsored terror is the most dangerous.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:00.900]  We'll continue with where this led on the other side.
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:05.900]  If you drive for a living, you don't get paid to stop or wait in line.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:08.900]  Keep your wheels moving with pre-pass.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.900]  Bypass waystations.
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.900]  Fly by port of entry facilities.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.900]  Stay moving at highway speed.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:19.900]  While the guy without pre-pass waits in line.
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:22.900]  Save time, save money.
[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:27.900]  Call 888-401-PASS to try pre-pass free.
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.900]  Call 888-401-PASS.

[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:27.900]  So, for 12 years for the big city government and for the central government,
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:33.900]  of the Home Office, the UK, he's an analyst looking at future terror threats,
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:36.900]  analyzing where the terror threat comes from.
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:41.900]  Well, if you're actually a real researcher, you would know that there was BBC,
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:48.900]  London Telegraph, I've got all the articles, police sees files of spiling to IRA murders.
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:49.900]  It goes on and on.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:54.900]  Double Agent was the real IRA's Omaha bomb team, and I've had these guys on
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:58.900]  and hidden in all these articles because they report on it, but they bury it.
[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:04.900]  It turns out that 7 out of 10 IRA commanders, going back 50 years on average,
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:10.900]  were British intelligence, staging terror attacks as a pretext to stay in Northern Ireland
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:14.900]  and to take the rights of Brits, now the most surveilled people on Earth.
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:19.900]  But side issue, the point is that this stuff's all hidden in plain view.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:26.900]  Now, Tony Farrell, their chief analyst, just a week or so out from this big report,
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:32.900]  in his research, he finds reality, and what happened when you brought them the reports, sir?
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:33.900]  Please continue.
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:39.900]  Well, the first thing I did, Alex, when this horrible realization occurred to me,
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:45.900]  I thought I had to go on alert management, and I did that, Alex, with a briefing note
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:47.900]  because we were getting very close to the deadline.
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:51.900]  Like, this was the 6th of July, the deadline was required on the 8th of July.
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:59.900]  So I made it my business to alert management in a shop with a briefing, though,
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:04.900]  that gave all of the hyperlinks, so I alerted them to your films,
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:09.900]  I alerted them to loose change in the compelling videos that were out there.
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:14.900]  That was on 9-11 and all, likewise with 7-7, the research, the compelling research,
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.900]  and I was saying to management, look, it's a case of usually we've got a problem here
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:23.900]  and we need to have a look at it because things aren't the way they seem.
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:31.900]  And that's shop management, and they really, on the 7th of July, they really sort of
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:37.900]  tried to get me up on socks, if Alex, and tried to go along with it and not rock the boat
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:41.900]  and go to the intelligence strategy management board on the 8th.
[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:46.900]  Just regarding what I believe to be the threat and just carry on as normal.
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:50.900]  I'd done all the work, so I was in a position where I could have actually
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:53.900]  carried it out and handed over the assignment to their satisfaction.
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.900]  They'd have loved that.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:58.900]  My problem was it would go against my conscience.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:03.900]  And quite frankly, Alex, this was a case that couldn't keep silent on.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:10.900]  Silent, you know, it's not golden, it's yellow, and I wasn't going to be cowardly over this.
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:12.900]  I had to make a stance.
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:16.900]  It was a defining moment on the 5th anniversary, that 7th of July, 2010,
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:21.900]  I came to that decision in my own conscience that I must make the stance.
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:28.900]  And on the 8th of July, I went in and made my stance and refused to hand over the product that they wanted
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:33.900]  later on for that afternoon's presentation for the Intelligence Strategy Management Board.
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.900]  I was asked then to explain myself in a report.
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:41.900]  I was sent home away from the office where they did an audit of my computer.
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:46.900]  And I was asked to come back in a few days' time with a report that explained
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:50.900]  why I felt necessary to make the stance, which I duly did.
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:52.900]  I told them all the reasons.
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:57.900]  I made inferences on the strategic threat to do with the new world order.
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:03.900]  And I made inferences that, yes, 9-11 was an inside job, 7-7 was an inside job.
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:09.900]  The media control and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are unjustified and morally wrong.
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:14.900]  And they were the purposes of furthering the new world order, the TANIC agenda.
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:20.900]  And, of course, that didn't go down well, but it was a report that didn't pull any punches.
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:25.900]  And I simply said, look, I cannot go against conscience.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:31.900]  The 9th Commandment, I'm a Christian, the 9th Commandment says, thou shalt not bear false witness.
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:38.900]  And I think that my assessment was that this wasn't done as Tony Blair blurted out.
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:40.900]  7-7 wasn't done in the name of Islam.
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:45.900]  This was done to blame Islam by Tony Blair.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:49.900]  And I wasn't going to be a false witness and do anything that would perpetuate
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:52.900]  a countenance of perpetuation of that lie.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:54.900]  So I stood firm.
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.900]  I went to an annual leave for three weeks while management decided what on earth to do with this.
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.900]  I told some conferences in my absence.
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:04.900]  I was very quickly told that there would be a hearing.
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:08.900]  I wouldn't be in the office ever again.
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.900]  So I appeared at the hearing on the 2nd of September.
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:16.900]  They asked me had I changed my opinion on any of this.
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:17.900]  I hadn't.
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:23.900]  In fact, my opinion, you know, in a time off, it researched even more and my opinion has become stronger.
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:28.900]  So I was up to the convince now and no doubt whatsoever that it was right to make this down.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:32.900]  They felt that my beliefs were incompatible with their role.
[01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:38.900]  And in some respect, I agree with them in the context that.
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:42.900]  Tony, Tony, stay there.
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:49.900]  That was a short segment, long 18 minute segment coming up with the chief terror threat analyst who was fired over this.
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:50.900]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:54.900]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:30:00.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:05.900]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:09.900]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:15.900]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:20.900]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:24.900]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:28.900]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:32.900]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:35.900]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:40.900]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:44.900]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science.
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:46.900]  One of my oldest sponsors.

[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:03.900]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:08.900]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized risk.
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:10.900]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:15.900]  One pure soap company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned real soaps
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:19.900]  that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:24.900]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes,
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:27.900]  perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:31.900]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes,
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:35.900]  itching sores and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:38.900]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:40.900]  you can do something you've never done before.

[01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:09.900]  This documentary is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:11.900]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:17.900]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.900]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:23.900]  now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:29.900]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:34.900]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:38.900]  Repair to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship,
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:44.900]  body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:47.900]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:50.900]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:34.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, it has been the naivete of the public in the west
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:43.900]  that has allowed unspeakable corruption to take deep, deep root into every sector of our society.
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:50.900]  Only facing the hard facts gives us any chance to turn the tide
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:55.900]  and then ultimately reverse what's happened to our civilization.
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:34:00.900]  Corruption either gets worse or gets better. It doesn't stand in one place.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:04.900]  And right now it was slowing because of an awakening.
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:06.900]  Now the system is steam-rollering.
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:13.900]  They are releasing every trick in the book to overwhelm us right now using psychological warfare principles.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.900]  We are being bum-rushed right now.
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:20.900]  We are under a full, no-holds-bar, 100% commitment assault.
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:23.900]  They're getting ready for even bigger wars, false flags.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.900]  You can see all the preparatory brainwashing going on.
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:29.900]  Now's the time to pray but also take action.
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:32.900]  Now we're going to go back to our guest here in just a moment.
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.900]  If you go to the Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com,
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:38.900]  we've also got this stuff up at infowars.com and PrismPlanet.com
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:44.900]  but nobody knows how to present the idiocy of the establishment like Matt Drudge.
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:50.900]  And Joseph Curl and all the other great folks over there at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:54.900]  Bernaki, gold, not money.
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.900]  It's actually a video clip.
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:58.900]  I didn't know what Deb was talking about earlier because I hadn't seen this.
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:00.900]  I saw it during the break.
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.900]  We're going to be playing that next hour when I got some guests in studio
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:10.900]  where Ron Ball talks about dollar devaluation and how QE3 is going to cause more inflation.
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:12.900]  And Bernaki says there's no inflation.
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:16.900]  It's like saying the sky in the blue or the sun doesn't come up in the morning.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:19.900]  And Bernaki goes on and tells Paul, gold is not money.
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.900]  Federal Reserve notes are money.
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:26.900]  And then if you scroll down on Drudge, he's got Bernaki announcing that they may launch QE3,
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:31.900]  which is a Weimar Republic-style inflation.
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:36.900]  So meanwhile the depression is so bad, there's copper thieves running around robbing.
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:39.900]  Crime is exploding but the government says everything is wonderful.
[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.900]  We're going back to our valiant guest to break down his view of 9-11 and 7-7
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:49.900]  from a criminologist and statistician's expert of view
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:54.900]  and what evidence showed him that these were blaring inside jobs.
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:58.900]  Gee, I think the hijackers trained at U.S. bases admitted, but nobody investigates that.
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:00.900]  I think that might be a little place to start.
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:03.900]  But we're going to talk to him here in just a moment.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:08.900]  Before we go back to our guest, I want to just remind you, speaking of gold and silver,
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:12.900]  Ted Anderson has a deal going.
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:17.900]  Today it may end or go up in price tomorrow.
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:20.900]  Big Brotherly Orwellian Nightmare Come True, excellent book free.
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:28.900]  And the American Dream, great illustrated documentary cartoon about the banking cartel.
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.900]  Both of these free for two silver dollars.
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.900]  Shipping is free, $75.
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.900]  You can't buy two silver dollars for 75 bucks, folks.
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:37.900]  And then get free shipping and all of this.
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:40.900]  The boss leader, Ted wants to introduce you to gold and silver,
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:42.900]  and he wants to get this book and these videos out.
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:48.900]  888, well, the number to call to get my films is 888-253-3139.
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:56.900]  But the number to call Ted is 800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:01.900]  Again, one more time, 800-686-2237.
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:04.900]  And lastly, speaking of satanic elite,
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:10.900]  the world leaders, including from Europe, are meeting starting tomorrow in Northern California.
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:12.900]  I'm the only person ever sneaking in and get out with footage.
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:16.900]  Others have tried to failed CBS News, Vanity Fair.
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:23.900]  But they also reported that it's a bunch of rich, mainly conservative leaders having gay sex.
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:26.900]  And I'm just saying they're hypocrites, is the point.
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:31.900]  And taking drugs and getting drunk and worshiping a big stone deity.
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:34.900]  And I happen to have it on tape.
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:39.900]  Two films on one DVD, The Order of Death and Dark Secrets of Side Bohemian Grove, 1995.
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:44.900]  And you get Invisible Empire free, getting into even more of the information by Jason Burmus and the book
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:46.900]  Big Brotherly Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:48.900]  We've never offered a special this good.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:50.900]  1995, it ends at the end of the month of July.
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:52.900]  It's the Bohemian Grove.
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:55.900]  Buy one, get two free, special, infowars.com.
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:57.900]  Okay, I'm done.
[01:37:57.900 --> 01:37:59.900]  Our guest now will have the floor.
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:07.900]  Tony Ferrell served as the Yorkshire Police 12 years as their chief intelligence analyst for future terror threats.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:10.900]  He has what, three degrees in criminology and statistics.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:16.900]  And the point here is, is that he was following this big report on future threats and said,
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:19.900]  well, there are no show, there's some Muslim terrorists.
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:22.900]  But the big threat is government sponsored.
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:23.900]  Here's my evidence.
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:24.900]  They said, we don't want to see that.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.900]  It's not compatible with our narrative.
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:30.900]  So you hire analysts to give you what the threat is.
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:33.900]  And even upon the threat of being fired, does he want to change your mind?
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:37.900]  And he said, no, I do not, you know, renounce my Christianity.
[01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:40.900]  So they said, well, we're going to politically burn you at the stake and fire him.
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:45.900]  You've gotten up to that point, continue, sir, and what's happened since, why you're now going public.
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:49.900]  And then let's break down 777 and 911 from your expert perspective.
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:57.900]  Right. Well, it's interesting, Alex, because the way they actually dismissed me, it was quite bizarre.
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:58.900]  It was a solemn occasion.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:02.900]  They dismissed me not from my incompatible beliefs.
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:04.900]  So that made my position untenable.
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.900]  There was no allegation here of any misconduct.
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:11.900]  And so they almost encouraged me through appeal.
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:19.900]  So in one step, they said, look, there's an appeal process to the police authority field, a bill committee.
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:20.900]  That's not the chief constable.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:24.900]  That's the politicians and independent members of the police authority.
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:26.900]  That'll be on the front of the panel.
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:30.900]  So I, I mean, I always said I probably wouldn't appeal.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:32.900]  They seem to want me to appeal.
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:34.900]  So I put them up on the offer.
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:35.900]  I appealed.
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:40.900]  But it did me no good because they still dismissed me.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:47.900]  And on the 26th of November, which left me four days to get this into an employment tribunal.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:55.900]  I'd been to my lawyers at that stage and they said that this might be, you know, your beliefs may be protected under certain law.
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:57.900]  So they may have acted unlawfully.
[01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:59.900]  It depends, but it's worth a try.
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:04.900]  And they're in the employment bracket, religious and belief regulations from 2003.
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:07.900]  So there was a potential discrimination case here.
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:12.900]  And also with the human rights legislation, there was a potential unfair dismissal.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:19.900]  So I put into an employment tribunal situation and that's ruining, that's ongoing at the moment.
[01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:20.900]  It's quite interesting.
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:28.900]  We've had a pre-hearing review to discuss whether it is a discrimination case.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:37.900]  As I pre-hearing review a couple of weeks ago, I'll say a couple of months ago, the decision was that my beliefs were not protected.
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:39.900]  But there isn't a grounds for appeal.
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:43.900]  In any case, I can go forward on an unfair dismissal.
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:52.900]  And there's a three-day hearing set aside for the, I believe it's the 7th, 8th and 9th of September.
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:54.900]  A dancing hearing.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:41:04.900]  But a key for me, I think, and a key strategy for all of this is to keep the actual belief, the discussion about the belief in court.
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:08.900]  So I fully intend, if I can, to launch an appeal.
[01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:12.900]  My boss thinks that there are grounds for appeal here.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.900]  So we can mount a legal challenge in court, which will be an interim hearing.
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:26.900]  But again, that will keep on the agenda the issues of my beliefs about the notion of false flag in terms of, you know,
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:31.900]  and the satanic new world order in terms of a religious belief and a philosophical belief.
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:42.900]  Well, first off, sir, I mean, just to add here, this is modern heresy for you to get fired when you're hired to analyze what groups are really behind the terrorism
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:46.900]  and try to track where the future threats are coming from.
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:56.900]  I mean, here in the U.S., we have Fast and Furious, where for two years the Attorney General directed the FBI, DEA and ATF to ship high-powered weapons into Mexico
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:58.900]  to then blame it on the Second Amendment.
[01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:08.900]  And even though this has all come out, they've now come out with the anti-gun moves using the event that they are admitted to have triggered.
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:19.900]  It's going on like nothing happened, but it's not heresy to know that governments have staged events against their own people as a pretext to get control.
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:21.900]  That is in the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:24.900]  That is a known fact.
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:32.900]  We have WikiLeaks three years ago releasing Army manuals in the U.S. where they train Army captains in special ops how to stage a false flag.
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:37.900]  You know, if you're in a third world area and overwhelmed, stage a massacre.
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:41.900]  And then blame it on the enemy. That'll force and multiply the people to help you.
[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:48.900]  And the argument here is an ancient 3,000-year-old Persian gambit, of course, in chess to sacrifice upon,
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:54.900]  or another piece in an opening move to make your enemy miscalculate and draw them in a sacrifice.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:43:00.900]  That's why the military does this, because they say, well, if we send in 100 troops, that'll draw the enemy out.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:07.900]  The 100 troops will be killed, but then we'll see the enemy's strength. We can then cut them off at a pincer, saving 10,000 troops.
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:10.900]  It's a cold-blooded calculation, so that's why they do this.
[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:16.900]  They see Islam as a threat. They want to take over the oil and resources. They want to invade these countries.
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:20.900]  So, of course, they're going to stage some events. They call it a justifiable sacrifice.
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:22.900]  That's the sick mindset.
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:29.900]  But to say we're conspiracy theorists or we're crazy because we know governments admittedly do this, it doesn't hold water.
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:35.900]  That's right, Alex. And in times, you mentioned George Orwell earlier, and in times of universal defeat,
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:38.900]  telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act, I'm afraid.
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:45.900]  It does. So continuing now, you're challenging all of this, but what about the fact that you're an analyst
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:51.900]  and they're not letting you give your terror threat prognosis?
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:58.900]  That also sounds like a national security issue that they're not letting you get your report out about who the terrorists are.
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:02.900]  Well, that's right. I offered to provide them a comprehensive report.
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:10.900]  This strategic assessment matrix was rather crude and simplistic, and I believe it's gimmicky.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:16.900]  It's a distraction, Alex, and I'm afraid that I think all the principal intelligence analysts,
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:22.900]  and each of the 40-feet police forces in England and Wales, it's they that want sacking if they don't stand up and say,
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:28.900]  this is no good, it's a massive distraction from actually doing intelligence analysis.
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:35.900]  I'm afraid, Alex, intelligence analysts, if you're an intelligence analyst, you're not a spin doctor,
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:42.900]  and I'm afraid I wasn't prepared to be a spin doctor in this instance, and I just wish that others would stand up
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:49.900]  and look outside now, and all by doing this, other analysts, news will break to other analysts,
[01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:57.900]  but they've got to do this, and we have to have a pure role to tell it as it is without causing fear or favor.
[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:03.900]  Well, Tony, that's a great point you raise. We know in England now, the former head of MI6 has admitted it,
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:09.900]  we know the White House and Downing Street memo show it, it's confirmed that Tony Blair and George Bush got together
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:17.900]  in 10 Downing Street and at the White House on two occasions and ordered their intelligence chiefs to fix intelligence
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:24.900]  around weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear. In Iraq, Tony Blair responded with the 45-minute speech,
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:34.900]  Powell responded with the anthrax vile, and they did all of this, and now we know they went in to MI6 and to the CIA
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:42.900]  and ordered the analysts to issue false reports. Both countries' analysts, including Dr. David Kelly, refused,
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:51.900]  and so, of course, they killed Kelly, and now we know that they created the Office of Special Plans fake analysts
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:46:00.900]  to create fake reports, so this is a major scandal that they're telling you to basically fix intelligence analysis for them.
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:08.900]  I think that's even bigger than, quote, them saying, we're going after you for your beliefs, or I mean, do you see where I'm going with this?
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:13.900]  Absolutely, and I wasn't going to bow down to their sacred cows, I wasn't going to bow down to their Caesar
[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:21.900]  because I've served something greater than that, and that's my God, and my conscience simply wouldn't allow me to go along
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:29.900]  with this monstrous lie and I just couldn't do it, and that's what led me to get the fact, and I'm afraid
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:36.900]  if they actually exerted that kind of pressure on other analysts, well, if they want to have a conscience,
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:43.900]  then they're going to have to get the sack unless this is blown up, and I feel as though there's a chink here in the armor, Alex,
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:50.900]  I think the British police force, they can be put under pressure here if we can just get this publicised more,
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:47:00.900]  and it takes one, I've done it, let's let other police put people in the police service, and they could start to come out now,
[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:02.900]  and that's what I really do hope will happen.
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:10.900]  Well, they better because the corrupt banks that run England and the U.S. and Europe are going to continue to stage terror attacks
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:20.900]  if we don't, now continuing here, looking at 7-7, looking at 9-11, look at Sybil Edmunds, she's an FBI translator
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:26.900]  translating NSA communiques, she testifies the 9-11 commission in closed doors,
[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:35.900]  that she heard the leaders of Al Qaeda on the phone with the CIA being directed in the year leading up to the day of 9-11
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:42.900]  in sex slaves, weapons, drugs, laundered cash.
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:47.900]  Of course we know Al Qaeda was created by our own government, so that makes sense,
[01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:53.900]  and she tries to bring that to our supervisors and is told to shut up, so there's not an analyst, there's somebody listening
[01:47:53.900 --> 01:48:01.900]  to all of this going on, and there's hundreds and hundreds of other people who have seen and witnessed the same thing.
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:07.900]  Let's look at 7-7 first, of course the 7-7 bombings in London for those that don't remember,
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:15.900]  used to sell the Iraq war and more, break down the big blaring issues with that, sir.
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:25.900]  Right, okay, well, 7th of July 2005, London bombing went off, and there were three underground stations,
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:29.900]  and a bomb that went off and Tavis Docs were...
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:38.900]  Now, few things that happened, 52 people were killed, plus four others, which was the alleged suicide bombers.
[01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:48.900]  Now, there was no inquiry into who committed the crime. Tony Blair immediately said that an inquiry would be a ludicrous diversion.
[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:56.900]  That's another disgrace, and instead we've been told who is guilty, and we've had a diversionary inquiry,
[01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:03.900]  later on down the line, just about the intelligence failures, where the real agenda is simply to conceal the truth.
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:08.900]  As you say, just as it was in the Hutton Inquiry for Dr. David Kelly,
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:13.900]  now there was a poor quality and anonymous official version of the London bombings,
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:20.900]  and that's deeply suspicious and unacceptable, and add to that, there's never been the proper inquiry,
[01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:25.900]  so you've got big problems there, Alex, and for the government to give us one narrative for 7-7,
[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:29.900]  without allowing all the other competing narratives to be officially heard in the process,
[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:37.900]  it's simply insulting, a disgrace. Now, a key thing here is the mock terror exercise that occurred.
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:44.900]  Now, this is fantastic, this. Peter Power, advisor-consultant, when all the bombs go off,
[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:48.900]  shortly afterwards, we're talking an hour or so after the bombs have gone off,
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:53.900]  this guy, Peter Power, advisor-consultant, goes on TV and announces this.
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:50:03.900]  He says, this is amazing, the terror attack, the terror training drill that we are into at the moment,
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:08.900]  where there's a thousand staff involved, it was actually simulating bombs going off,
[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:13.900]  but the exact same stations and locations actually happened.
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:17.900]  Now, with statistical terms, Alex, if there's certain, certain can be that a drill exercise
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:21.900]  might be the exact same locations and dates of the actual bombs,
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:26.900]  that could not have occurred by mere coincidence. Now, was that investigated?
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:30.900]  No. Should it have been, well, you're damn right it should, that.
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:33.900]  And by the way, we're going to break, we got two more segments.
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:40.900]  Offers the insight that's needed to find out really what happened, and it's a disgrace.
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:44.900]  All right, stay there, sir, we gotta go to break, and we're gonna come back and let you finish on that.
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:47.900]  We got one little segment in that first five minutes of the hour,
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:51.900]  then we got guests coming in, we'll definitely have to have you back up in the future,
[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:57.900]  just to go over your own research, but absolutely, they ran drills on 9-11, Oklahoma City.
[01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:22.900]  They always run a drill to cover the real attack.

[01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:05.900]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:08.900]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:13.900]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:19.900]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:24.900]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:30.900]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:34.900]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:38.900]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches,
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:41.900]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:43.900]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:48.900]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:35.900]  You know, a lot of people engage in delusional magical thinking.
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:43.900]  They think that you can just decide there aren't false flag terror attacks.
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:47.900]  I mean, you read the history of France and England fighting with each other and others.
[01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:49.900]  They were constantly doing it.
[01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:52.900]  Constantly doing dirty tricks against each other.
[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:55.900]  Blowing up an ammo dump and then blaming it on the other.
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:57.900]  This is war.
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:55:02.900]  The issue is war is now being used against us domestically by our own governments.
[01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:07.900]  That's an act of war shipping tens of thousands of farms into Mexico then blaming on the Second Amendment.
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:10.900]  And it's admitted the government did that.
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:13.900]  Okay, people, we need to grow up or they're going to keep using this tool.
[01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:18.900]  So this is a short five-minute segment serving out one more little five-minute segment and we'll have to have you back.
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:25.900]  The continuing talking to Tony Ferrell, who was in his police department and also worked in the federal government as a top terror analyst,
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:28.900]  ran into all this false flag history and information.
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:37.900]  You'd gotten into the drills of 777, the exact same bus, exact same place, exact same time, exact same trains, exact same place, exact same time.
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:39.900]  Actuaries have been done.
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:41.900]  It's in the thousands of tractor-gillians.
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:44.900]  That's, you know, billions of times all the sand grains in the world.
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:46.900]  It's nearing infinity.
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:53.900]  I mean, it's the equivalent of finding a unicorn, a leprechaun, and Santa Claus in your backyard jumping rope.
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:56.900]  It doesn't exist, but please continue.
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:56:07.900]  Yeah, the spineless, anonymous storm office official version that had flaws in it that subsequently the government had to admit there were lies.
[01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:17.900]  The 747 ghost train that went from London to St. Pancras that the Patsy was supposed to be on, but they didn't catch because the train never ran.
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:22.900]  And that was only an independent researcher that found that out later on and shamed the government.
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:25.900]  They had to change it, but they couldn't get the story to fit.
[01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:30.900]  So that whole sort of patch of the report is ludicrous.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.900]  And of course, why run the drill?
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:37.900]  Well, you've got some young Arab gentlemen who are working, you know, with the government, who are teachers and things.
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:40.900]  They're taking part in a patriotic anti-terror drill.
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:43.900]  Uh-oh, something's going to happen.
[01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:56.900]  I mean, Alex, I'm afraid I, you know, at least one or two of those, you know, Patsy's were taken out in assassination at Canary Wharf is the most plausible explanation.
[01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:59.900]  I certainly don't believe they were on the train.
[01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:13.900]  The military's style explosives on the train, a far more plausible explanation than the so-called explosions in the backpacks,
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:17.900]  that they self-detonated themselves in wonderful synchrony.
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:20.900]  So all of that seems totally ludicrous.
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:29.900]  The profile of these bombers, the personification of these people was not such that these were going to commit suicide.
[01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:35.900]  And if you've got videos that purport that they were, I actually believe that was part of a training drill.
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.900]  So there's so many things wrong with it.
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:44.900]  And I think we look at the G8 summit on the day of Glenn Eagles and what on earth was Tony Blair doing?
[01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:50.900]  A few hours later, coming on record, when the police had announced that we don't know who's done this yet,
[01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:54.900]  but Tony Blair does, he knows this has been done in the name of Islam.
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:57.900]  And I think that is a disgrace.
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:59.900]  I think that is unacceptable.
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:04.900]  But I wish just good people in the UK would actually see it because I think they're blind.
[01:58:04.900 --> 01:58:09.900]  Well, it gets worse at the Tavistock Institute bus bombing.
[01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:15.900]  It turns out there were people with fake bandages on who were seen before and then after with them off,
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:18.900]  you know, covering their whole faces being bandaged up.
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:25.900]  I mean, this was off the charts, insane and openly staged.
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:31.900]  And the reason they had to admit they were doing drills is because people who were part of the drill then start questioning what happened.
[01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:35.900]  But by seeing an authority figure admit the drill, then they think it's all out in the open.
[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:39.900]  That's why Larry Silverstein admits they blew up building 7. We'll be right back.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:10.900]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:35.900 --> 02:00:00.900]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:06.900]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:10.900]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:13.900]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:17.900]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:23.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:30.900]  Well, we got Matthew Medina and Cody Hess, great political activist with a lot of news joining us coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:34.900]  They've also brought a friend along, Miss French.
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:38.900]  But we're going to be talking more in the future with Tony Ferrell.
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:40.900]  He's got a website going up soon. He's going to be publishing stuff.
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:43.900]  It's like, you know, an open source analyst for the people.
[02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:48.900]  We also need to support him in what he's doing there in Air Script One.
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:50.900]  Tony, you were making the point during the break to myself.
[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:55.900]  You've been out for a week now, or five, six days, and no mainstream media in England.
[02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:59.900]  You would think this would be newsworthy that a head analyst at a police department,
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:05.900]  a guy who was an analyst for the central government, the home office, comes out with this and that they're staying quiet.
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:09.900]  They don't want folks to look into this.
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:20.900]  On a lot of truth websites all over the world in a remarkably short space of time following the interview I did on richpanic.com.
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:25.900]  And I'd point out, Alex, that people don't have to take my word for it.
[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:30.900]  They can Google, they can search the web, and there's some fantastic analysis.
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:33.900]  The big picture, 777, the ripple effect.
[02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:41.900]  All these documentaries are so superior to the government version, and people need to make their own mind up.
[02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:49.900]  They need to start looking, because there's utterly compelling evidence that makes the government version ludicrous.
[02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:54.900]  And we've had a recent inquiry, Alex, as you know, to look at intelligence failure.
[02:01:54.900 --> 02:02:02.900]  We just disheveled it. And don't take my analysis, I've not gone into too much detail on that, but there's a chap called Nick Collestrum,
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:12.900]  who's stayed every day at the inquiry and has done detailed analysis that completely discredits the whole of that inquiry.
[02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:19.900]  And that needs to be seen and needs to be heard, because that inquiry never allowed any searching questions to be asked.
[02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:21.900]  Why not?
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:28.900]  And there's come some narratives, there's analysis that ruins the inquiry's verdict.
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:33.900]  And if that's the case, we've got corruption in the court, so I'm afraid.
[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:39.900]  And the people that were certain witnesses aren't being allowed to call, so it's all biased.
[02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:43.900]  So where do you go? We've got to get the breakthroughs, the mainstream media.
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:49.900]  We've got to get the public alerted, because I'm afraid, Alex, it's a bit like you say it is in the America.
[02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:54.900]  People are just blind to it, and they turn a blind eye, and they're cowardly, and they need to wake up.
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:59.900]  It's hard as it may seem, but we can't keep silent any longer.
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:05.900]  And we need to put pressure through my court case, we can put pressure on one police force.
[02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:11.900]  This is potentially one means to really put pressure on the government.
[02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:20.900]  So I think, Alex, there's going to be a truth movement behind the progression of my court case, and that might help.
[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:30.900]  It might help put a good pressure on, because certainly 9-11 and 7-7 will be discussed in the court at the pre-hearing review we touched on 9-11.
[02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:39.900]  And my beliefs on 9-11, you know, similar to yours, but the judge thought they were absurd, and he's on record of saying that.
[02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:46.900]  So we've got absurd beliefs, Alex, but we've got the real beliefs, I believe, the gist of it.
[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:51.900]  So that needs to be in the public domain, and we need to get the people to look at it.
[02:03:51.900 --> 02:04:00.900]  All right. Well, Tony Pharrell, we just appreciate your courage and the fact that, you know, you could have just gone along with the official story and not lost your job.
[02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:08.900]  You've done a lot more than most people would ever even think about doing, and it's going to be men and women of conscience who do stand up and at least have the courage
[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:12.900]  to speak out against the lies that are going to turn the tide against this evil.
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:19.900]  I mean, all the lies about WMDs, the fake intelligence, the other stage terror attacks that have been declassified.
[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:30.900]  If you've got groups that have done this before, and they have the motive and they stand to gain, and only they can carry it out in a swat the supposed head of the bombings, it turns out as MI6.
[02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:33.900]  I mean, even Fox News and Associated Press have covered that.
[02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:40.900]  This stuff comes out, and then nothing's ever done, and then you and analysts go look at all this information, and they say, you're fired.
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:43.900]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:47.900]  Mr. Pharrell, thank you so much for joining us. We look forward to talking to you again in the future.
[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:53.900]  We'll have you back as a criminologist to really walk through all of this, not just your case, in the near future. Godspeed.
[02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:55.900]  Thank you, Alex. God bless.
[02:04:55.900 --> 02:05:04.900]  Thank you, sir. We've got guests coming in studio. Coming up, stay with us.
[02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:29.900]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:34.900]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:39.900]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:46.900]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:53.900]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:53.900 --> 02:06:00.900]  They're yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it. Others don't.
[02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:28.900]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:35.900]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:40.900]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:45.900]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:51.900]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:07:00.900]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:07.900]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:15.900]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:20.900]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:25.900]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:33.900]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:41.900]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:51.900]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:07:51.900 --> 02:08:19.900]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:28.900]  Well, I guess now for a few years I have known Matthew Medina and I've seen the videos online with Cody Hess.
[02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:36.900]  They're great activists and they're also radio talk show hosts. I can hear them here locally in Austin on 90.1 weeknights.
[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:42.900]  And I just really enjoy listening to their show when I'm driving home later in the evening and tuning into it.
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:50.900]  I thought, why not have Matthew Medina and Cody Hess in studio and they brought another We Are Change activist, Rachel French along with them.
[02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:59.900]  And they're going to be with us for the rest of the hour. We'll have to get some headphones on towards the end because I am going to take some calls from 9-11 truthers out there or folks that disagree with us.
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:09.900]  But we're going to see a lot of attacks coming up in the future against 9-11 truth because it's out there that government states tear.
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:14.900]  It's out there that Obama shipped guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment. He doesn't care that he's been caught.
[02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:19.900]  They're still going to use it and are now announcing they're using it to go after the Second Amendment.
[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:25.900]  They're telling gun shops how many guns they can sell now outside of law. That's called dictatorship.
[02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:28.900]  I don't have a law, but I'm the decider. So that's the way it is.
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:40.900]  And we've had this slide towards tyranny, but now you got Mitch McConnell yesterday saying, we'll just give Obama the power of the purse, violates Article 1, Section 8 to another extent, Section 7, Article 1, Section 7.
[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:51.900]  This is all happening right now. And coming up later, we've got Ron Paul grilling the head bankster, Ben Bernanke, and Bernanke tells Paul, gold is not money.
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:58.900]  Our fiat money is money. And they're going into QE3 now, like Mexico did back in the 80s, devaluing the dollar.
[02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:04.900]  The peso soon will be on par with the dollar to give people an idea, or I guess with the old ruble.
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:09.900]  But they're telling us there's no inflation. It's very low. Everything's fine.
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:14.900]  But more and more they're having to admit, no, we're actually in a depression. So a lot is happening.
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:19.900]  And I don't know where to start with you guys. You're doing a great job down in San Antonio.
[02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:27.900]  And there's other people spontaneously all over the country confronting politicians with real questions involved in activist actions.
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:37.900]  But Matthew Cody, and of course, he didn't really want to be interviewed. We drug her in here. Rachel, I mean, just what do you think is most important happening in the world right now?
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:46.900]  It's that like people are really starting to get active. I mean, I think that's the most important thing is that people now are using that information they know to hit the streets and get something done.
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:51.900]  Yeah, definitely. I would say one of the most important things to talk about right now, activism. The activism is red hot.
[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:57.900]  I mean, we can look around the world and see the revolutions and of course, their stage, and we can see all this.
[02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:02.900]  But here's something genuine in the Info War activism. We want to highlight that because that's what we've been doing.
[02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:06.900]  That's what I've been doing for four years now in San Antonio, as you know, because I've seen you a lot, you know, around here.
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:17.900]  Texas is doing doing activism and it's been nonstop and definitely so much going on in the role like you just brought up. But I mean, specifically, the operation gun runner, Fast and the Furious.
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:24.900]  We've planned two street actions for this month. One of our friends, Henry Havoc, from We Are Changed San Antonio, made this sweet little box and it opens up.
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:29.900]  What is Fast and the Furious? It opens up and we're going to put the articles and a flyer and everything.
[02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:37.900]  It's like a presentation and we we intro them to the false flag of this whole ATF letting the guns walk and we're custom making DVDs that we're going to hand out.
[02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:40.900]  So it's two actions we're going to do on that topic this month.
[02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:45.900]  And I should also add, you guys make videos of the actions that have been seen by millions of people.
[02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:50.900]  And this is an example of how the alternative media is becoming the mainstream media.
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:57.900]  But getting into Fast and Furious, now it's coming out that the government actually shipped them and delivered them to Los Zetas.
[02:11:57.900 --> 02:12:03.900]  Well, Selicastillo told us that six years ago and again, five years ago, and they locked them up and they locked him up for it.
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:10.900]  I mean, their lives are finally eroding. It's starting to get like that. I mean, the more this stuff gets out there in the open and exposed, I mean, the more we have an opportunity to wake everybody.
[02:12:10.900 --> 02:12:16.900]  And the people that have said, we're kooks, they're the fools. 15 years ago, I had government documents. They knew that cell phones were causing brain cancer.
[02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:22.900]  Well, here it is. Fox News, CNN, cell phones, cancer, infertility, 100% fact. See?
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:27.900]  Yeah, yeah, just like they knew asbestos was bad. If you want to go old school, they know a lot of these things are bad for us.
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:31.900]  And that's why it's our duty to expose it. And right now is the time everybody has information.
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:38.900]  We're seeing young people waking up when we do street actions. I mean, the people that recognize this the most on the streets, San Antonio are teenagers watching our YouTube videos.
[02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:43.900]  So it's a good thing to, I mean, that's a really positive thing, a bright thing for the future.
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:48.900]  So definitely encouraging all the listeners to take action. Yeah, the new generation is the way the future.
[02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:53.900]  Like right here we got an article, Ron Paul, why the young flock to an old idealist.
[02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:56.900]  I mean, they try to frame it like he's an old guy, it's old ideals.
[02:12:56.900 --> 02:13:00.900]  But really, I mean, this guy is putting everything that all young folk would like.
[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:04.900]  I mean, all the young generation wants to be free. They don't want to live in this tyranny they see.
[02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:07.900]  And they see their future eroding. That's what I see. I mean, I'm young. I'm 21 years old.
[02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:11.900]  I see like 10 years from now. Am I going to have a future? It doesn't look like it.
[02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:16.900]  Not if we let these criminals continue to blow stuff up and take our rights and poses our savior.
[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:19.900]  Rachel, how did you get woken up?
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:24.900]  Well, I started looking into videos just online and I started kind of...
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:27.900]  No, it's like they're moving over. We need to hook a few more up in here. Go ahead.
[02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:33.900]  Basically, well, at first I didn't really want to believe a lot of the things that I was, you know, finding.
[02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:42.900]  And I kind of like look the other way, but you get to a point where you can't because there's just so many facts, you know, that are just like right in front of your face.
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:49.900]  I think people just like to live like, I don't know, in their own world and not really acknowledge like what's going on.
[02:13:49.900 --> 02:13:56.900]  And that's like a source of frustration, I think, for all of us because it's like we're trying to wake people up and a lot of people like don't want to hear it.
[02:13:56.900 --> 02:14:01.900]  Well, yeah, I mean, we got killers running things. We better get them out of there. We're not safe.
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:03.900]  Got a face reality.
[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:06.900]  Yeah, it's definitely just a basic gut reaction to all this information.
[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:09.900]  I mean, what are we supposed to do to find out about all this and not do anything?
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:12.900]  Are we just gonna stay home and play video games? Are we not supposed to get fired up about this?
[02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:17.900]  Are we just supposed to get fired up about what Xbox Live, PS3, watching some HD?
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:19.900]  I mean, come on, some serious stuff is going on.
[02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:21.900]  We need good people to stand up, stand for what's right.
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:25.900]  And yeah, a lot of people put up a fake front that they don't want to hear this because they're faking it themselves.
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:30.900]  They're not an inner peace and ready and willing to stand up for those around to stand for what's good.
[02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:31.900]  And that's what we're trying to do.
[02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:44.900]  We are changing San Antonio to the exposed radio and we are encouraging and highlighting all the other people feeling the same way as us, the guys in Dallas, the health and light guys who, I know they got in the top 10, the V for victory video where they just plastered posters everywhere.
[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:45.900]  They just made the global news video.
[02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:46.900]  They covered the whole Dallas area.
[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:50.900]  They had two videos that were just on the front of Info Wars recently in the last week.
[02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:51.900]  They're awesome.
[02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:52.900]  No, no, I mean, listen.
[02:14:52.900 --> 02:14:53.900]  They got passion. We got passion.
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:58.900]  And listen, they can't kill or lock us all up and it's growing exponentially.
[02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:03.900]  Take Luke Radowski, they kicked him out of 9 11 truth because it was pretty much controlled in New York to a certain extent.
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:05.900]  I put him on air said, folks, follow this example.
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:09.900]  The cops tried to say he had bombs turned out that was fake.
[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:10.900]  It totally exploded.
[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:12.900]  And then he was an example to others.
[02:15:12.900 --> 02:15:13.900]  Now you're an example to others.
[02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:15.900]  It's a chain reaction.
[02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:22.900]  What do you make of Bob Graham coming out on MSNBC, one of the top 9 11 commissioners and say in the US government did protect the hijackers.
[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:29.900]  They're finally having to come out with their lies because 9 11 truth is going so much to where they're now they're going to have to say, yeah, it is that way.
[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:31.900]  But, you know, what are you guys going to do about it?
[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:33.900]  Well, their new hoax is 9 11 truth dead.
[02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:34.900]  Are you kidding?
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:36.900]  Yeah, it's on fire everywhere.
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:40.900]  Nine years ago, most of the radio stations kicked me off because 9 11 truth.
[02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:42.900]  Now they're putting me on because of it.
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:45.900]  It's totally mainline now.
[02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:49.900]  So the BBC is running this hoax that, oh, 9 11 truth is dead.
[02:15:49.900 --> 02:15:50.900]  Yeah, folks.
[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:52.900]  It's a war tactic.
[02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:56.900]  A war tactic to get all of us is to be like, oh, you've lost the war is over.
[02:15:56.900 --> 02:15:57.900]  Yeah, go home.
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:15:58.900]  That's what they want.
[02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:03.900]  Well, it's also saying cease fire and then they fire all their weapons because everyone is already so frustrated.
[02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:06.900]  Like she was saying that people just won't accept the knowledge.
[02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:09.900]  They won't wake up so you can get frustrated because it's like you see all this going on.
[02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:11.900]  But people around you, they won't wake up to it.
[02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:14.900]  And then if they even if they do wake up to it, they won't get active with it.
[02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:16.900]  And I think that's that's all that really matters.
[02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:18.900]  I mean, just knowing the knowledge isn't enough now.
[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:20.900]  I mean, that time has passed now.
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:25.900]  We're at the precipice in history where we really have to make a choice, get active or sit back and say, oh, they'll do it.
[02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:26.900]  Well, here's an example.
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:29.900]  I've got several million people that listen to this show every day.
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:32.900]  What would happen if all of them sort of putting out a neighborhood newsletter?
[02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:37.900]  What would happen if all of them got a even if you don't understand the technology?
[02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:39.900]  I didn't understand the technology years ago.
[02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:42.900]  Get your neighbor to help you do YouTube videos every day.
[02:16:42.900 --> 02:16:43.900]  It's very easy.
[02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:45.900]  What if everybody started talking?
[02:16:45.900 --> 02:16:48.900]  Everybody will reach people. Everybody will have a good effect.
[02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:52.900]  Some people are going to be more talented, more intelligent than I am or you are.
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:55.900]  We're going to find future Alex Jones's future.
[02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:56.900]  Yeah, Luc Radowsky's.
[02:16:56.900 --> 02:16:59.900]  We're going to find, you know, future Rachel French's.
[02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:01.900]  We're going to find future Cody Hess's.
[02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:03.900]  We're going to find future Ron Paul's.
[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:05.900]  It's time to turn it loose.
[02:17:05.900 --> 02:17:10.900]  Just like they have the farming teams for baseball, it is time to turn it on.
[02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:11.900]  Yeah, and you're right.
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:13.900]  And the spring of the sports analogy is perfect.
[02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:18.900]  I would say Truth Exposed Radio is the sports center of the new wave of anti-New World Order activists.
[02:17:18.900 --> 02:17:21.900]  I mean, you have Matias and Pedro and Chili who confronted David Rock.
[02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:22.900]  You have them all on.
[02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:27.900]  That's the show I heard last week where you had like 20 different activists on from all over the world.
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:32.900]  That many of them are making national news by slamming and banning.
[02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:38.900]  Right now, Matias and Pedro and Chili, they just released a classified document from a business,
[02:17:38.900 --> 02:17:44.900]  a $7 billion US plan to build this energy line, and it's 70% of the people are against it.
[02:17:44.900 --> 02:17:48.900]  Well, the documents released to Matias, and he leaked them out.
[02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:52.900]  And now the publications that Chili are saying his website is the weekly leaks of Chili.
[02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:53.900]  This just happened yesterday.
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:54.900]  They sent it to me.
[02:17:54.900 --> 02:17:55.900]  And these guys are young.
[02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:56.900]  I mean, they're young.
[02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:57.900]  Listen, history's here.
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:03.900]  Listen, down the road, you're going to wish you got in the fight for 1776.
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:08.900]  Worldwide, it's time to just get some on the New World Order.
[02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:09.900]  Dude, it's right here.
[02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:10.900]  Yeah.
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:16.900]  Don't wait till 20 years when it's all, oh, it's cool.
[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:18.900]  No, jump on it now before it's cool.
[02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:19.900]  We're doing it now.
[02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:22.900]  Matias and Pedro and Chili over here in the US.
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:24.900]  And now more people are going to send them documents.
[02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:25.900]  That's right.
[02:18:25.900 --> 02:18:26.900]  Yeah, more people.
[02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:28.900]  And they'll try to take over that, but more will be launched.
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:31.900]  I mean, we need to launch a thousand X-wings at this Death Star.
[02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:35.900]  Throwing info nuggets in the pond of consciousness of the minds of men is what we're doing.
[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:36.900]  We're just launching DVDs.
[02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:38.900]  We found it out well over 30,000.
[02:18:38.900 --> 02:18:39.900]  That's what I've always said.
[02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:40.900]  Don't stop.
[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:41.900]  Just fire all directions.
[02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:42.900]  Keep going.
[02:18:42.900 --> 02:18:43.900]  I'm not stopping.
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:45.900]  You had out 100 DVDs and it gets to one person to watch it.
[02:18:45.900 --> 02:18:46.900]  I mean, you already woke up in mind.
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:47.900]  I mean, that's all that matters.
[02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:50.900]  I would spend 20 bucks to get 100 DVDs to wake up one person.
[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:52.900]  And that's how we've been surviving.
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:56.900]  It's the fact that people, it's like a family network and we are changing San Antonio.
[02:18:56.900 --> 02:18:57.900]  Different people always pitching in DVDs.
[02:18:57.900 --> 02:19:00.900]  So we could keep going and keep going and we keep making videos.
[02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:03.900]  And for example, our camcorder died last year and we haven't had a camcorder.
[02:19:03.900 --> 02:19:05.900]  We've been using our iPhones.
[02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:07.900]  So the point is you do what you can.
[02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:08.900]  I'll give you one right now.
[02:19:08.900 --> 02:19:13.900]  I've got piles of old cameras that are compatible with our new computers.
[02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:14.900]  We didn't stop.
[02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:15.900]  We can make videos with what we have.
[02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:16.900]  And that's what we try to tell everybody.
[02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:18.900]  Just do what you can with what you have.
[02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:19.900]  No stress out about you.
[02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:21.900]  But now you've gotten to some cameras, then you're saying?
[02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:22.900]  No.
[02:19:22.900 --> 02:19:23.900]  So we're going to give you some right now then.
[02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:24.900]  Okay, that's awesome.
[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:25.900]  We're going to put a news.
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:28.900]  The videos are just as important as the action because the videos show an example of how to get active.
[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:29.900]  It shows that it's easy.
[02:19:29.900 --> 02:19:30.900]  We go out there.
[02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:31.900]  We have a good time.
[02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:32.900]  We're not out there like, oh, we got to do this.
[02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:33.900]  We're like, hey, let's have fun with it.
[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:34.900]  We go.
[02:19:34.900 --> 02:19:35.900]  We have a lot of fun.
[02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:38.900]  Well, listen, I got some AK-47s for you in the Info War.
[02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:41.900]  I've got a bunch of cameras we really can't use.
[02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:42.900]  They're not compatible with the latest computers.
[02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:44.900]  So we're going to get you some more weapons.
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:45.900]  That's awesome.
[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:48.900]  But I mean, exactly all over the place, people are having a huge effect.
[02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:49.900]  Stay there.
[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:54.900]  Let's talk about more of what's happening and see if we can't cause an info riot here today.
[02:19:54.900 --> 02:19:55.900]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:55.900 --> 02:19:59.900]  This is the GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com.
[02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:30.900]  Visit 10X Fundraising for 10 times a profit today.
[02:20:55.900 --> 02:21:00.900]  www.hardsuit.com
[02:21:00.900 --> 02:21:03.900]  They help to create a new world order.
[02:21:03.900 --> 02:21:05.900]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:08.900]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:13.900]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:18.900]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:20.900]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:26.900]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:34.900]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.900 --> 02:21:39.900]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.900 --> 02:21:42.900]  Global governance with the establishment of a G20.
[02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:46.900]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.900 --> 02:21:48.900]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:05.900]  Gold, if you listen to the radio, watch TV or surf the net, you're hearing about gold.
[02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:09.900]  Eventually you will ask yourself, is gold right for me? The answer might surprise you.
[02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:12.900]  We protect ourselves and our families from many things.
[02:22:12.900 --> 02:22:15.900]  Do you have medical insurance? Is your home insurance? Do you carry life insurance?
[02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:17.900]  How about financial insurance?
[02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:19.900]  If you own gold, then the answer is yes.
[02:22:19.900 --> 02:22:23.900]  If you don't own gold, the question is why don't you have financial insurance?
[02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:29.900]  We put our faith in things we trust. Do you trust the dollar? Do you trust the economy? Do you trust the government?
[02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:31.900]  Gold has always been something you can trust.
[02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:35.900]  For thousands of years, people have put their faith in gold. Where will you put your faith?
[02:22:35.900 --> 02:22:38.900]  Now is the time to protect yourself and your family.

[02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:45.900]  No way Bill. You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:48.900]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.

[02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:27.900]  All right ladies and gentlemen, I am really excited to have some great political activists who I didn't even know over the last year
[02:24:27.900 --> 02:24:30.900]  have been shooting videos on their iPhones, but that works pretty darn good actually.
[02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:37.900]  So we've got some video cameras that we actually still use occasionally, but we always try to move up to the even higher res.
[02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:43.900]  One is an HD Sony hard drive, another that I've had for years.
[02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:45.900]  I've done a lot of work with this little baby myself.
[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:49.900]  We've had this five, six years. This has seen a lot, including Bilderberg Group 2006.
[02:24:49.900 --> 02:24:52.900]  We're giving you both these with the firewires and the equipment.
[02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:57.900]  Two little terrorists in the info war to go out there and show the evil that's going on,
[02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:06.900]  but also show the folks that you're waking up and the politicians like Twinkle Toes, Perry, the former chief of staff in Texas for Al Gore.
[02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:10.900]  God bless him. So you guys are just doing a wonderful job.
[02:25:10.900 --> 02:25:15.900]  Please continue. So you're down there in San Antonio Military City, USA.
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:18.900]  Even when the newspaper tries to come photograph the giant NSA base,
[02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:21.900]  the police come and tell them to turn off their cameras in America.
[02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:23.900]  We've had that happen to us too.
[02:25:23.900 --> 02:25:27.900]  We are down there in NSA trying to get some video footage and they're coming out.
[02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:28.900]  What's happening to you?
[02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:32.900]  I didn't really tell anybody because they actually did intimidate me to delete my footage.
[02:25:32.900 --> 02:25:36.900]  And I was kind of, I kept, I mean, the group of guys were like, man.
[02:25:36.900 --> 02:25:41.900]  Yeah. Well, if they're off their jurisdiction at the Home Depot, you know, a quarter mile away,
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:43.900]  next they're going to be in your house.
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:46.900]  Yeah. And I mean, you know, that's why I want to encourage all activists.
[02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:48.900]  Definitely know your rights. I mean, of course,
[02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:49.900]  I mean, we know what you're doing in there.
[02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:52.900]  You're running all our communications illegally through your computers.
[02:25:52.900 --> 02:25:54.900]  We know your crooks. We know you stage 9 11.
[02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:55.900]  Oh yeah. I mean, right.
[02:25:55.900 --> 02:25:56.900]  We know, you know, terrorist.
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:25:59.900]  Yeah. And we try to drop info bombs on them. I gave them DVDs.
[02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:02.900]  These are NSA police. And as soon as we got out of the street,
[02:26:02.900 --> 02:26:06.900]  we're going to hang posters for one of the videos across the street from then to say right away,
[02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:09.900]  they came pulled up, got out, they had a police suits and they right away,
[02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:12.900]  they want to get our info. But basically I gave them the DVDs.
[02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:15.900]  He got them, walked to a car, put them in a plastic bag, sealed it,
[02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:18.900]  and then put the plastic bag in the car. Yeah.
[02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:20.900]  But, um, you know, that was about.
[02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:21.900]  Yeah. Well, don't worry.
[02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:24.900]  They're, they're, they're civil Edmunds heard them commanding all kind of.
[02:26:24.900 --> 02:26:27.900]  So, I mean, you know, they, of course, they don't want you filming them.
[02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:28.900]  They carried out 9 11.
[02:26:28.900 --> 02:26:33.900]  I mean, these are terrorists. You know, Wayne Madsen exposed the Q unit and the NSA
[02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:37.900]  covering up 9 11. They are covering it up and they're definitely got a big presence
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:40.900]  in San Antonio as well as a lot of military bases.
[02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:43.900]  And these are the people that we're trying to wake up when we do street actions
[02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:46.900]  in front of the Alamo just all around San Antonio putting up posters.
[02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:47.900]  We're going to do that this Saturday.
[02:26:47.900 --> 02:26:50.900]  We're going to go put up Ron Paul 2012 posters everywhere.
[02:26:50.900 --> 02:26:53.900]  And we're going to make a video with these little babies right here.
[02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:56.900]  These little exclusive limited edition Alex Jones,
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:26:58.900]  build a bird camcorder. What?
[02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:01.900]  That's all. That's a baby all cutter out there.
[02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:04.900]  Yeah. So, yeah, we're definitely going to be on the streets this month.
[02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:06.900]  Three, three, three street actions. We've got this much.
[02:27:06.900 --> 02:27:08.900]  Hopefully more. We're going to stop.
[02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:10.900]  That's something we're not going to stop this.
[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:12.900]  I mean, they, they can try to, you know, make us feel all down.
[02:27:12.900 --> 02:27:14.900]  Like we can't make a change. We know we can.
[02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:17.900]  Because we've seen, I mean, how many more people are tuning into your show every day?
[02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:20.900]  How many more people are, you know, liking our page on Facebook that we have.
[02:27:20.900 --> 02:27:23.900]  They're like, yeah, tell us about your terrorist websites.
[02:27:23.900 --> 02:27:26.900]  Well, we have truthexposedradio.com is our radio website.
[02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:30.900]  We actually just put up a new website, which is our newworldactivist.com.
[02:27:30.900 --> 02:27:33.900]  That's a new site we're working on. It's going to be like an alternative media website.
[02:27:33.900 --> 02:27:36.900]  What we're really trying to do is pull the whole community of everyone that gets active.
[02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:37.900]  All the subcultures.
[02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:39.900]  You know, from Chile, the guys down there in Chile.
[02:27:39.900 --> 02:27:41.900]  By the way, it's Rachel French, not French.
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:44.900]  They brought her along. I just met her and thought I'd drag her in here.
[02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:46.900]  What do you think of all this?
[02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:51.900]  Basically, yeah, we just try to do what we can to, you know, get the information out there.
[02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:56.900]  It's a lot of fun and we have a great team and everybody is like a family, like he said.
[02:27:56.900 --> 02:27:59.900]  So, yeah, we're definitely trying to plan more.
[02:27:59.900 --> 02:28:02.900]  Well, it's exciting to get out and talk to people, you know, take San Antonio.
[02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:09.900]  More and more, they try to have Air Force police and others out policing citizens in the middle of San Antonio.
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:12.900]  And I know some folks down in San Antonio have exposed that as well.
[02:28:12.900 --> 02:28:15.900]  I mean, we've got to get in their face or they're going to get in our face.
[02:28:15.900 --> 02:28:19.900]  And then the, I mean, here's CPS is to start taking people's fat children.
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:23.900]  Next, it'll be if your children are one pound overweight, they're trying that in Arkansas.
[02:28:23.900 --> 02:28:25.900]  These people aren't going to stop.
[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:28.900]  We've got to teach government. They work for us.
[02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:30.900]  Yeah, because if you don't, they're going to keep pushing it.
[02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:36.900]  And I know you saw the news article with the video cameras in the kitchens of the cafeterias, the schools and elementary.
[02:28:36.900 --> 02:28:38.900]  Yeah, the Pentagon runs that.
[02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:40.900]  Well, what's wrong with the Pentagon watching children?
[02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:42.900]  Yeah, so are you against America?
[02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:44.900]  Are you against the troops?
[02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:47.900]  Are you against the troops being used as guinea pigs with experimental shots?
[02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:50.900]  Are you against the troops drinking between all eight?
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:53.900]  Look, troops, police, you're all being murdered by the globalist as well.
[02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:58.900]  Time to grow up and realize our country's been hijacked by a scientific dictatorship.
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:28:59.900]  Okay, grow up.
[02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:05.900]  Look at Fast and Furious, your terrorist masters shipping guns down there that have killed three border patrol agents.
[02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:09.900]  Are we al-Qaeda because we don't want to give guns to the cartels?
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:10.900]  I guess we are.
[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:11.900]  Yeah, well, that's all it's all about.
[02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:15.900]  I mean, everyone operates in this mainstream illusion that the whole system, I mean.
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:18.900]  America's good. America doesn't exist anymore.
[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:20.900]  And only by admitting that will we get it back.
[02:29:20.900 --> 02:29:21.900]  Well, that's what we say.
[02:29:21.900 --> 02:29:26.900]  I mean, you look at the mainstream illusion and you have, you know, your big talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity.
[02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:29.900]  You got, you know, Ed Schultz, all these guys, they talk about and they stay within the mainstream illusion.
[02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:31.900]  They talk about the 9% unemployment.
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:32.900]  We know the real unemployment.
[02:29:32.900 --> 02:29:33.900]  No, they're tossing a football back and forth.
[02:29:33.900 --> 02:29:35.900]  It's all, they prop each other up.
[02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:36.900]  It's a little illusion.
[02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:37.900]  It's a little game that they put up.
[02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:39.900]  It's like, you know, just creating this little fairy tale world.
[02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:44.900]  And for some reason, you see the most mainstream media organizations, they operate within it.
[02:29:44.900 --> 02:29:50.900]  While the real folks running in it are a bunch of murdering terrorists spiking your water with carcinogens and radioactive isotopes.
[02:29:50.900 --> 02:29:54.900]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.900 --> 02:30:19.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:19.900 --> 02:30:27.900]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:35.900]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:30:35.900 --> 02:30:40.900]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:31:18.900 --> 02:31:22.900]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.900 --> 02:31:27.900]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:31.900]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.

[02:33:33.900 --> 02:33:35.900]  I just knew too much.
[02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:38.900]  Does that make me crazy?
[02:33:38.900 --> 02:33:41.900]  Does that make me crazy?
[02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:44.900]  Well, possibly, my friends.
[02:33:44.900 --> 02:33:46.900]  Wow, it's great having these folks in studio.
[02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:48.900]  It is going to be the young people.
[02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:50.900]  It's going to be the middle-aged folks, the old people.
[02:33:50.900 --> 02:33:54.900]  It's going to be human beings that stand up and face the facts.
[02:33:54.900 --> 02:33:57.900]  And the journey of a thousand miles does start with a single step.
[02:33:57.900 --> 02:33:59.900]  Go over when you're having a barbecue with your neighbors.
[02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:03.900]  They're wanting to tell you about LeBron James or whatever, you know,
[02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:07.900]  diversions going on and say, yeah, that LeBron James, that's real interesting.
[02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:09.900]  What about dollar devaluation?
[02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:11.900]  What about all these new wars?
[02:34:11.900 --> 02:34:16.900]  What about the fact that the president's grabbing dictatorial power?
[02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:18.900]  What are we going to do about it?
[02:34:18.900 --> 02:34:23.900]  Or are we just people that sit here and watch television and live in this controlled paradigm?
[02:34:23.900 --> 02:34:27.900]  And going back to Cody Hess, Cody, you got cut off by the break.
[02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:32.900]  We're talking about this false reality and how people are literally in this trance,
[02:34:32.900 --> 02:34:34.900]  actually, technically, physically.
[02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:37.900]  I mean, that's admitted from watching television and the culture.
[02:34:37.900 --> 02:34:39.900]  And if we went to break, you got cut off.
[02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:41.900]  Well, yeah, it's just social engineering, basically.
[02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:46.900]  I mean, it's this false reality that for some reason, I mean, you have the majority of the public still living in.
[02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:50.900]  I mean, when they say there's 9.2% unemployment, we all go, not us, obviously,
[02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:52.900]  but everyone goes, oh, yeah, 9.2% unemployment.
[02:34:52.900 --> 02:34:53.900]  We already know it's way above that.
[02:34:53.900 --> 02:34:58.900]  And we already know that this whole thing, Libya, is a war, yet so many people operate within the mainstream illusion saying,
[02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:01.900]  yeah, it's not a war, it's just a kinetic military action.
[02:35:01.900 --> 02:35:04.900]  It's just a love, there's love bombs being dropped.
[02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:07.900]  You know, like you say, I mean, it's, and but everyone operates within it, it's ridiculous.
[02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:12.900]  And we're always trying to expose the mainstream illusion because, I mean, the longer that the mainstream is guiding the world,
[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:15.900]  we will be stuck in this, but the alternative media is on the rise.
[02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:20.900]  And we are seeing, like, we have stuff right here, Internet gains on television as public's main news source.
[02:35:20.900 --> 02:35:24.900]  We're always talking about an on-show because we're saying social networking is the way to spread news in the future.
[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:28.900]  And that's why they're, they're trying to go to make it illegal to put you, embed YouTube clips.
[02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:30.900]  I mean, how many people watch cool little, you know...
[02:35:30.900 --> 02:35:32.900]  Well, YouTube sets it up for you to do that.
[02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:33.900]  People want you to.
[02:35:33.900 --> 02:35:36.900]  You can set your channel where you can't embed if you don't want.
[02:35:36.900 --> 02:35:40.900]  Yeah, but I mean, they're gonna, they're gonna try to do whatever they can to stop this knowledge from flowing out,
[02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:41.900]  but they're not gonna stop.
[02:35:41.900 --> 02:35:46.900]  Yeah, because right now, like, we have this headline, 43% of news sharing online is via social media.
[02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:50.900]  And that's how people listening can take action to sharing information right here in the same article.
[02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:57.900]  It says, the study found that 27% of frequent sharers, defined as those sharing at least six stories each week,
[02:35:57.900 --> 02:36:01.900]  were responsible for 87% of all news shared online.
[02:36:01.900 --> 02:36:06.900]  Keep sharing, keep spreading the info wars.com links.
[02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:11.900]  We're kicking, by the way, our Facebook, that gets about 300,000 visitors a day.
[02:36:11.900 --> 02:36:17.900]  That was just a fan Facebook they gave us, was shut down yesterday and we, for no reason,
[02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:20.900]  let me see if our Facebook's still up again.
[02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:22.900]  Well, they're great activists on Facebook that are...
[02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:23.900]  It's back, it's back.
[02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:27.900]  But listen, Google's been doing all sorts of squirrely stuff.
[02:36:27.900 --> 02:36:30.900]  Oh yeah, they're rolling out their social network and they want control of this.
[02:36:30.900 --> 02:36:33.900]  I mean, they're definitely got their fingers up and everything,
[02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:38.900]  but positivity, definitely operation info jam the system is a movement going on Facebook
[02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:42.900]  where people are just jamming the White House Facebook page, celebrity Facebook pages,
[02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:46.900]  pages to mainstream shows that get a high millions of viewers.
[02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:48.900]  They're going to their Facebook pages to drop in police day four,
[02:36:48.900 --> 02:36:51.900]  in a visible empire, an end game, and they're dropping them in comments
[02:36:51.900 --> 02:36:54.900]  and they're just taking over Facebook and just sharing all this information.
[02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:55.900]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:36:55.900 --> 02:36:56.900]  They're calling the info jam the mainstream.
[02:36:56.900 --> 02:36:57.900]  That's awesome.
[02:36:57.900 --> 02:37:03.900]  By the way, we did a Google bomb a few days ago and lately they've been failing
[02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:07.900]  unless I give a really archaic, and I forgot to do it today, so we'll do it later,
[02:37:07.900 --> 02:37:14.900]  in the week, but the point is they admittedly changed their algorithm to try to block us
[02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:18.900]  and now they've got big indexes of popular terms, can't criticize Google,
[02:37:18.900 --> 02:37:20.900]  can't criticize Obama.
[02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:23.900]  They admit they're changing their algorithm to block alternative news sites
[02:37:23.900 --> 02:37:24.900]  because they're desperate.
[02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:27.900]  It shows we're having an effect or they wouldn't be trying to block us.
[02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:30.900]  Yeah, you're finding holes within the mainstream illusion within the system.
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:33.900]  We're finding holes and then every time we find them, they try to cover it up really quick.
[02:37:33.900 --> 02:37:36.900]  Then we move to the next hole and they can only do that for so long.
[02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:38.900]  There's going to be a point where we're way ahead of them.
[02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:39.900]  We are gaining the numbers.
[02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:40.900]  That's what's awesome.
[02:37:40.900 --> 02:37:41.900]  I look around.
[02:37:41.900 --> 02:37:42.900]  We are gaining the numbers.
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:44.900]  I mean, more and more people are tuning into your show, Alex.
[02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:47.900]  I mean, even at my work, I wouldn't even really talk about the stuff.
[02:37:47.900 --> 02:37:50.900]  People walked up to me and see my bumper stickers in my car.
[02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:51.900]  You know, 9-11 wasn't inside job.
[02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:52.900]  They're like, oh, you listen to Alex Jones?
[02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:53.900]  I'm like, yeah.
[02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:56.900]  And people all over the place that are just really starting to really get out there.
[02:37:56.900 --> 02:37:57.900]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:37:57.900 --> 02:37:59.900]  I'm going to like Trisha by day.
[02:37:59.900 --> 02:38:03.900]  Not as eloquent as Clark Kent's Daily Planet reporter by day.
[02:38:03.900 --> 02:38:06.900]  But I talked to a lot of people on the job sites.
[02:38:06.900 --> 02:38:09.900]  And it's like I was talking to some guys about the other day.
[02:38:09.900 --> 02:38:12.900]  And he's like, oh, yeah, somebody else gave me some Alex Jones DVDs.
[02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:14.900]  And I was like, oh, here, I got some for you in my tool bag.
[02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:15.900]  Boom.
[02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:17.900]  And for War DVDs with the seven movies on it that are.
[02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:18.900]  No, the power of people.
[02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:22.900]  And of course, we've been doing that pre-internet being what it is today.
[02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:26.900]  The power of access television, the power of using whatever medium you can.
[02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:28.900]  People are desperate for the truth.
[02:38:28.900 --> 02:38:30.900]  They're desperate for alternative information.
[02:38:30.900 --> 02:38:35.900]  And that's why we have Senator Jay Rockefeller and others calling to end the free internet as we know it.
[02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:41.900]  Former head of the NSA Hayden is calling to quote in the internet as we know it and force us onto this new controlled internet.
[02:38:41.900 --> 02:38:43.900]  But the genies already out of the bottle.
[02:38:43.900 --> 02:38:50.900]  And we're going to continue, even if they did that with the person to person DVDs, you know, the person to person information.
[02:38:50.900 --> 02:38:55.900]  If they shut down all that, we'll have local newspapers just like the founding fathers did.
[02:38:55.900 --> 02:38:56.900]  Yeah.
[02:38:56.900 --> 02:38:57.900]  That's what I was saying.
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:38:58.900]  I dare them to shut down the internet.
[02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:00.900]  I mean, they'll just get everybody out there on the streets.
[02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:04.900]  And they definitely want that because a human to human interaction is way stronger than even the internet.
[02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:05.900]  Well, yeah.
[02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:07.900]  Again, when I tell this story, I'm not bragging.
[02:39:07.900 --> 02:39:11.900]  In fact, it's the opposite because I don't like listening to my show.
[02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:13.900]  I don't really like a lot of my delivery.
[02:39:13.900 --> 02:39:15.900]  You know, sometimes I hear part of my show.
[02:39:15.900 --> 02:39:16.900]  That was really good.
[02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:17.900]  That was gold.
[02:39:17.900 --> 02:39:19.900]  But a lot of times I do this a lot.
[02:39:19.900 --> 02:39:27.900]  I tended to even better interviews when I'm on somebody else's show or when I'm at home with an iPhone because I'm in here for years.
[02:39:27.900 --> 02:39:31.900]  You know, in a way, it almost psychologically becomes stale and oppressive.
[02:39:31.900 --> 02:39:32.900]  I don't like doing this.
[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:34.900]  I have dreams about not doing this.
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:39.900]  I have dreams where I'm a forester or a doctor or an auto mechanic.
[02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:43.900]  And in the dream, I wake up and I'm not Alex Jones and I'm so happy.
[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:46.900]  It's the opposite because of the great responsibility.
[02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:53.900]  But if I told people the type of phone calls I get, the famous people that call me, I mean, the biggest people there are.
[02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:57.900]  But in 99% of the cases, they don't want to come on the show.
[02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:02.900]  You know, in some cases they say, well, you can talk about me if you want and say that I support what you're doing.
[02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:03.900]  But then I don't even do that.
[02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:05.900]  They're not 100% in on it.
[02:40:05.900 --> 02:40:10.900]  But it's getting exponential, exponential, exponential.
[02:40:10.900 --> 02:40:16.900]  And I use that as a radar ping that all these famous people are calling me showing that this isn't something that's trendy.
[02:40:16.900 --> 02:40:17.900]  It's an awakening.
[02:40:17.900 --> 02:40:18.900]  It's permanent.
[02:40:18.900 --> 02:40:20.900]  It's not like Zoot suits are in.
[02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:25.900]  And you know, in the 1950s or whatever, this is about reality and a renaissance of awakening.
[02:40:25.900 --> 02:40:26.900]  And again, I'm known.
[02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:29.900]  My ugly, fat bulldog mug is known.
[02:40:29.900 --> 02:40:33.900]  And so I have something that other people who are activists don't.
[02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:36.900]  I actually get a chance to see how many people are awake.
[02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:43.900]  And it is incredible exponentially how many people come over to me, how many people shake my hand, no matter where I am in the world.
[02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:47.900]  I mean, our numbers are much higher than the average person thinks.
[02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:52.900]  I definitely agree with that because I mean, you see it all around us from art to music, culture.
[02:40:52.900 --> 02:40:55.900]  I mean, everything's leaning towards exposing this information.
[02:40:55.900 --> 02:41:00.900]  I mean, like the Luminati influence and the mainstream industry and the music industry.
[02:41:00.900 --> 02:41:01.900]  Everybody knows about that now.
[02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:07.900]  Even Sundance had to make a VH1 style TV show and Mark Dice was on there by Secret Societies.
[02:41:07.900 --> 02:41:08.900]  Oh, it's everywhere.
[02:41:08.900 --> 02:41:11.900]  Like the new Rush songs are about the new world order and corruption.
[02:41:11.900 --> 02:41:14.900]  I hear all these new rock and roll country songs.
[02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:20.900]  It's all about the corrupt, you know, fat cats and we got to wake up and muse who are listeners of the show.
[02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:21.900]  It's everywhere.
[02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:22.900]  Yeah, it's everywhere.
[02:41:22.900 --> 02:41:23.900]  And we're helping it grow.
[02:41:23.900 --> 02:41:25.900]  I mean, we're sparking the fire.
[02:41:25.900 --> 02:41:26.900]  Info jamming the mainstream.
[02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:27.900]  Info jamming the mainstream.
[02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:30.900]  Taking action, making music, making art.
[02:41:30.900 --> 02:41:33.900]  And that's what we're trying to do with our, we're trying to create a website.
[02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:35.900]  We do have a website, newworldactivist.com.
[02:41:35.900 --> 02:41:39.900]  Highline artists, musicians and activists and just get that going.
[02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:43.900]  Just that subculture, the next generation of people using all means to get the information out.
[02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:44.900]  Cause it is a new world.
[02:41:44.900 --> 02:41:46.900]  Everything's changing and we're doing something.
[02:41:46.900 --> 02:41:49.900]  And that's why the globalist, and they admit this in books they've written,
[02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:58.900]  try to hijack countercultures or try to create false countercultures because in 20 year cycles, it always becomes the culture.
[02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:05.900]  Well, this is a total awakening, true liberty outside the box, outside the left, right paradigm system.
[02:42:05.900 --> 02:42:06.900]  And we are the future.
[02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:11.900]  And that's why the system is trying to come in with tyranny right now because they know their time is short.
[02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:16.900]  Yeah, we're trying to jump ahead of the game and highlight that new wave of people using the different means to get the info out.
[02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:19.900]  The info culture, whether it's art, music, whatever.
[02:42:19.900 --> 02:42:22.900]  We're trying to highlight that newworldactivist.com, Truth Exposed Radio.
[02:42:22.900 --> 02:42:23.900]  And it's going on.
[02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:26.900]  I mean, lots of people are waking up, young kids and everybody into everything.
[02:42:26.900 --> 02:42:27.900]  And they're doing different things.
[02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:33.900]  Like We Are Change Atlanta made the, We Are Change Atlanta made a video where they're using street art to paint a picture.
[02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:35.900]  I've done it in one of our We Are Change San Antonio videos.
[02:42:35.900 --> 02:42:36.900]  I mean, people are doing that.
[02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:39.900]  There's so many different ways we can get the ideas across.
[02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:43.900]  Absolutely. Talking to Rachel France.
[02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:48.900]  Rachel, as you begin to research more and more of this, how has it changed your view of the world?
[02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:50.900]  It's completely changed my view of the world.
[02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:52.900]  It turned everything upside down for me.
[02:42:52.900 --> 02:43:00.900]  And I'm not in a good way, but it is, I don't know, just being able to like feel like, I don't know, sometimes you feel that you can't really do anything.
[02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:05.900]  And it's very frustrating because you're only one person and there's so much, you know, that needs to be done.
[02:43:05.900 --> 02:43:11.900]  But if everybody could just, you know, do something like my thing is having time.
[02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:17.900]  You know, a lot of people say they don't have time and you can always make time, you know, to do this.
[02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:19.900]  Even if it's a little thing, just find your niche.
[02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:21.900]  I'm not a political person.
[02:43:21.900 --> 02:43:27.900]  I'm not, I'm not really even a person who likes to, you know, speak in front of people or I'm kind of shy, but.
[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:28.900]  But you're doing it.
[02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:29.900]  Yeah, I am.
[02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:30.900]  You're doing a good job too.
[02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:35.900]  No, but it's just, it's really important and it's something that you can't ignore.
[02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:36.900]  So, you know.
[02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:41.900]  Well, that's what's allowed the corruption to grow and grow and grow until they're telling people they can't have tomatoes in their yard.
[02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:45.900]  They're telling people you can't speak at city council, even though it's the law that you can.
[02:43:45.900 --> 02:43:46.900]  Yeah.
[02:43:46.900 --> 02:43:49.900]  I mean, it's just showing that government has gone crazy.
[02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:52.900]  We want me, we're going to live under the exact monetary need that we put up with.
[02:43:52.900 --> 02:43:56.900]  And if everyone sits back and just gets lazy, and that's what's happening in America.
[02:43:56.900 --> 02:44:00.900]  I mean, I think we've just gotten lazy. We let the mainstream media tell us what's going on in the world.
[02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:01.900]  We don't do our own research.
[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:05.900]  And I mean, we just say, hey, you know what, it'll get taken care of.
[02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:06.900]  It's just, it's just what happens.
[02:44:06.900 --> 02:44:07.900]  It's just politics.
[02:44:07.900 --> 02:44:08.900]  No, it's not.
[02:44:08.900 --> 02:44:11.900]  There isn't, it's not the left-right battling back and forth, you know, is liberal or conservative.
[02:44:11.900 --> 02:44:14.900]  No, this is a system taking over.
[02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:17.900]  I mean, we are being hijacked as a nation, as a world, as humanity.
[02:44:17.900 --> 02:44:20.900]  I mean, look at, look what the globalists are doing in the whole world.
[02:44:20.900 --> 02:44:23.900]  I mean, they're messing up with the DNA structure of the entire earth.
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:26.900]  I mean, they're, they're messing.
[02:44:26.900 --> 02:44:29.900]  Oh, our DNA is fried. Fertility is plunging. Cancer is exploding. Diabetes is exploding.
[02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:33.900]  I got stacks of articles here where they openly talk about getting rid of us.
[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:36.900]  That's their plan. I mean, that's, they want the planet to themselves.
[02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:39.900]  And I mean, who really knows at the very core exactly what they want.
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:42.900]  And you know, a lot of people want to know all the answers when we go out there and talk to them like,
[02:44:42.900 --> 02:44:44.900]  oh, well, tell us how they did this, what they're going to do here.
[02:44:44.900 --> 02:44:45.900]  Well, look, we don't know.
[02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:47.900]  We're seeing the basic framework of what's going on.
[02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:51.900]  And I mean, the basic framework is enough to get you up and active and saying, look, I'm.
[02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:56.900]  Exactly. I mean, if I was a wild pig and I got caught in a trap, I'd want to get out.
[02:44:56.900 --> 02:44:59.900]  And you know, animals know that animals won't eat the GMO.
[02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:00.900]  But, but, but, you know, humans do.
[02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:03.900]  In fact, I have all these articles I meant to get to today.
[02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:06.900]  I mean, here's one Fox News cell phones cancer and infertility.
[02:45:06.900 --> 02:45:11.900]  And it goes through the fact of all these governments are even admitting a major research institutes
[02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:16.900]  after the fact that fertility is plunging cell phones and rat studies do destroy fertility.
[02:45:16.900 --> 02:45:21.900]  Double the chance of brain cancers.
[02:45:21.900 --> 02:45:28.900]  And again, why was I called a kook 14, 15 years ago for covering that from studies that were out then?
[02:45:28.900 --> 02:45:31.900]  They knew then just now the cancers are exploding.
[02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:34.900]  Now they're acting like they tried to protect us from it.
[02:45:34.900 --> 02:45:37.900]  And these elitists have their own kids using cell phones.
[02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:40.900]  I mean, there's a certain there's a self destructiveness to it.
[02:45:40.900 --> 02:45:45.900]  When the WHO came out with it, that's when the whole mainstream media talked about when the World Health Organization said,
[02:45:45.900 --> 02:45:46.900]  Yeah, it's causing cancer.
[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:48.900]  Then all they'll all talk about it.
[02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:49.900]  Now it's OK to talk about it.
[02:45:49.900 --> 02:45:52.900]  But when it was, you know, a bunch of big group of people are saying,
[02:45:52.900 --> 02:45:54.900]  No, for a long time it causes cancer.
[02:45:54.900 --> 02:45:57.900]  I mean, a lot of people I talked to knew it, but they never want to talk about that was crazy.
[02:45:57.900 --> 02:45:58.900]  That was on the fringe.
[02:45:58.900 --> 02:45:59.900]  But now it's out there.
[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:01.900]  And that's what they're going to do with everything.
[02:46:01.900 --> 02:46:02.900]  Guarantee you one day they're going to say,
[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:03.900]  Yep, 9-11 wasn't inside job.
[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:04.900]  They did a golf of Tonkin.
[02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:06.900]  Oh, yeah, it's declassified.
[02:46:06.900 --> 02:46:08.900]  Yeah, it never, it never happened.
[02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:09.900]  It's, you know, way down the line.
[02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:12.900]  They kind of tend to leak a little more information.
[02:46:12.900 --> 02:46:15.900]  But it's obvious we're, we're sending a trend, we're a head of the curve,
[02:46:15.900 --> 02:46:18.900]  breaking news articles, doing street actions, you know, like y'all are doing here,
[02:46:18.900 --> 02:46:21.900]  breaking the news before it even hits mainstream.
[02:46:21.900 --> 02:46:23.900]  We're trying to hit the same information with the streets and,
[02:46:23.900 --> 02:46:25.900]  and really encouraging people to take action.
[02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:27.900]  There's so many different ways you can get this information out.
[02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:28.900]  We don't have time to waste.
[02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:29.900]  We're trying to shut down the internet.
[02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:31.900]  They're poison on us even worse.
[02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:34.900]  I mean, forcing these light bulbs in our houses here.
[02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:35.900]  You know, it doesn't stop.
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:36.900]  Yeah, tomorrow is not promised.
[02:46:36.900 --> 02:46:37.900]  Tomorrow is not promised.
[02:46:37.900 --> 02:46:38.900]  Use today.
[02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:39.900]  Get active now.
[02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:41.900]  And that's what, that's the one message we'd want to say to everybody out there.
[02:46:41.900 --> 02:46:43.900]  That's what Truth Exposed Radio is about.
[02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:44.900]  That's what humanity is about.
[02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:46.900]  It's getting active, not just sitting back and, and, you know,
[02:46:46.900 --> 02:46:47.900]  waiting for somebody else.
[02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:51.900]  Doesn't matter your beliefs or, or your, your ideological beliefs.
[02:46:51.900 --> 02:46:53.900]  I mean, we don't discriminate at our show.
[02:46:53.900 --> 02:46:56.900]  We're just saying whether you're a Christian, atheist, Muslim, Jew,
[02:46:56.900 --> 02:46:59.900]  whatever you are, let's just get together and stand up for what's right
[02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:02.900]  and really be humble, humble your heart and look in yourself and see who you are.
[02:47:02.900 --> 02:47:04.900]  Because that's what's going to shine around you.
[02:47:04.900 --> 02:47:06.900]  That's going to be the example of who you are.
[02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:09.900]  So as an info warrior, you don't need to really need to be an info snob,
[02:47:09.900 --> 02:47:12.900]  speak it to the audience and get upset at people for not getting it.
[02:47:12.900 --> 02:47:14.900]  You got to have a humble your heart and have mercy on them
[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:16.900]  and hope that they'll wake up someday.
[02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:19.900]  Be an example of what it means to be awake and do creative things
[02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:21.900]  and merciful things for those around you.
[02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:23.900]  And we could be examples those around us and get,
[02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:26.900]  get really a wave of, of being a good person.
[02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:27.900]  Exactly.
[02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:29.900]  We can't look at these people and, you know, call them just morons.
[02:47:29.900 --> 02:47:31.900]  They are literally in a trance.
[02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:34.900]  They are physically living in a false reality.
[02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:35.900]  Yeah.
[02:47:35.900 --> 02:47:38.900]  Like sheep going off the edge of a cliff and we've got to warn them.
[02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:41.900]  We've got to wake these sheep up, not just for them, but for us.
[02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:44.900]  We have no future if we don't do this because as the globalist
[02:47:44.900 --> 02:47:48.900]  implode society, they're going to direct the sheep who are confused
[02:47:48.900 --> 02:47:52.900]  against every good institution, everything that's wholesome.
[02:47:52.900 --> 02:47:55.900]  I mean, look at this article out of the age newspaper in Australia
[02:47:55.900 --> 02:47:58.900]  and literally there are hundreds of these a week now coming out
[02:47:58.900 --> 02:48:01.900]  in the corporate new world order brainwashing media.
[02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:04.900]  Humans become pets in the rise of the machines.
[02:48:04.900 --> 02:48:08.900]  Apple co-founder says, and that's Steve Wansnick.
[02:48:08.900 --> 02:48:10.900]  And then I have all these other articles.
[02:48:10.900 --> 02:48:14.900]  They had a Sun Microsystem saying in why the future doesn't need us
[02:48:14.900 --> 02:48:16.900]  in, in, in Wired magazine.
[02:48:16.900 --> 02:48:20.900]  He says, I've met with the elite and they're discussing and this is in 98.
[02:48:20.900 --> 02:48:24.900]  Should we kill everyone in the world government or do we give people
[02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:27.900]  something to do and, you know, take care of them like pets because
[02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:29.900]  we're going to merge with the machines.
[02:48:29.900 --> 02:48:32.900]  Now, whether that's going to happen or not, you know, great Kurzweil,
[02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:34.900]  their guru, the age of spiritual machines.
[02:48:34.900 --> 02:48:36.900]  In fact, Aaron's back there.
[02:48:36.900 --> 02:48:40.900]  He's got the eugenics society publication with Julian Huxley.
[02:48:40.900 --> 02:48:44.900]  And this was even in the 60s after, you know, people knew about Hitler
[02:48:44.900 --> 02:48:47.900]  and everything saying this would be their plan.
[02:48:47.900 --> 02:48:50.900]  The age of spiritual machines and they talk about how they're going
[02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:53.900]  to merge with machines singularity and get the, and, and exactly
[02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:55.900]  and get rid of the rest of us.
[02:48:55.900 --> 02:48:58.900]  Yeah, we actually, me and her watched that documentary transcendent man
[02:48:58.900 --> 02:49:00.900]  and we were blown away.
[02:49:00.900 --> 02:49:03.900]  We were watching the whole time thinking, this guy literally wants to be God.
[02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:05.900]  I mean, the way he actually, he's like, I don't want to die.
[02:49:05.900 --> 02:49:06.900]  He wants to bring his dad back.
[02:49:06.900 --> 02:49:09.900]  He wants to make like a robot of his dad.
[02:49:09.900 --> 02:49:11.900]  I mean, these people are, are messed up in the head.
[02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:15.900]  Well, yeah, he said, in fact, the quote is, he says, I don't believe in God yet,
[02:49:15.900 --> 02:49:17.900]  but, but, but I'm going to be God.
[02:49:17.900 --> 02:49:19.900]  That's exactly right.
[02:49:19.900 --> 02:49:22.900]  And that's these are the conversations going on behind the closed doors.
[02:49:22.900 --> 02:49:24.900]  Everyone's going, oh, what are they talking about?
[02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:25.900]  It's behind the closed doors.
[02:49:25.900 --> 02:49:26.900]  Now, this is what's going on.
[02:49:26.900 --> 02:49:28.900]  I mean, this is what people are talking about.
[02:49:28.900 --> 02:49:31.900]  I mean, whether it's real or not, I mean, whether they're going to be able to
[02:49:31.900 --> 02:49:35.900]  manifest this or not, they all go to meetings, William Shatner goes,
[02:49:35.900 --> 02:49:40.900]  their closed doors, thousands of elitist and they open and the minutes have come out.
[02:49:40.900 --> 02:49:43.900]  They've written books, the Rockefellers go to it and they talk about,
[02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:45.900]  we can't give the life extension to the public.
[02:49:45.900 --> 02:49:50.900]  We're going to slowly wipe everybody out and then we're going to be transcendent
[02:49:50.900 --> 02:49:51.900]  and live forever.
[02:49:51.900 --> 02:49:55.900]  And, and, and then they write about, well, actually most of the people we're recruiting
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:49:56.900]  aren't going to get this.
[02:49:56.900 --> 02:49:57.900]  We're going to kill them later too.
[02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:01.900]  I mean, this is such a, a psychopathic crazy thing.
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:02.900]  Here it is.
[02:50:02.900 --> 02:50:03.900]  Evolutionary studies.
[02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:10.900]  And it says a certainty celebration of the life of Julian Huxley edited by Milo
[02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:13.900]  Kynes and Ann'sworth Harrison.
[02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:16.900]  And if you look, it's put out by the eugenics society.
[02:50:16.900 --> 02:50:21.900]  And this is the founder of transhumanism that they've all just repackaged and put
[02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:24.900]  out low level stuff for the general public like transcendent man.
[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:27.900]  You get deeper into what they all write about.
[02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:28.900]  They're going to kill us.
[02:50:28.900 --> 02:50:30.900]  And it's wonderful and beautiful.
[02:50:30.900 --> 02:50:32.900]  And they're going to be God.
[02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:35.900]  And again, that's Ray Kurzweil.
[02:50:35.900 --> 02:50:38.900]  Bill Joy says that this is a terrible thing.
[02:50:38.900 --> 02:50:41.900]  He says, I think you should know they're talking about killing everybody.
[02:50:41.900 --> 02:50:44.900]  This is Wired Magazine, Sun Microsystems founder.
[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:45.900]  Yeah, this is.
[02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:47.900]  I mean, I mean, you might want to, yeah, you might want to listen to that.
[02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:49.900]  But, you know, they sell it like it's cool.
[02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:52.900]  You know, the head of SEGO saying that, you know, one day of video games are going
[02:50:52.900 --> 02:50:55.900]  to be chips in your body and then Ray Kurzweil is talking about that.
[02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:56.900]  They're going to make it trendy.
[02:50:56.900 --> 02:50:59.900]  But they're only going to give us the level of it that does enslave us.
[02:50:59.900 --> 02:51:01.900]  They're building the architecture to dehumanize.
[02:51:01.900 --> 02:51:06.900]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security,
[02:51:06.900 --> 02:51:07.900]  what would it be?
[02:51:07.900 --> 02:51:08.900]  That's easy, Bill.
[02:51:08.900 --> 02:51:12.900]  I've head straight to soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:51:12.900 --> 02:51:13.900]  Soupbeansurvival.com?
[02:51:13.900 --> 02:51:15.900]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy.

[02:51:20.900 --> 02:51:24.900]  It truly is nature's super survival food.
[02:51:24.900 --> 02:51:26.900]  Really, Brian, the number one survival food?
[02:51:26.900 --> 02:51:28.900]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[02:51:28.900 --> 02:51:29.900]  Absolutely, Bill.

[02:51:43.900 --> 02:51:44.900]  No way, Bill.
[02:51:44.900 --> 02:51:46.900]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.

[02:54:08.900 --> 02:54:18.900]  You know, I haven't read this worship of Julian Huxley, the former head of the UN UNESCO program that sets the policy for our public schools.
[02:54:18.900 --> 02:54:35.900]  I haven't read this one, so Aaron ran in during the break and he said, look, you've got to look at chapter 13 where they say that the UN and Huxley set this up as the new world religion of transhumanism, which is really eugenics.
[02:54:35.900 --> 02:54:40.900]  And it says eugenics is the world religion, and this is the religion the elite follow.
[02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:48.900]  Now, I'd never seen them say eugenics was their religion. I had always said they behave and act like it's a religion and follow it like a religion.
[02:54:48.900 --> 02:54:53.900]  Here they are saying it is their religion. This is the founder of transhumanism.
[02:54:53.900 --> 02:55:02.900]  And you have Bertrand Russell, who's another eugenicist, Nobel Prize winner, so-called anti-war thinker, who was saying in his writing, Scientific Society.
[02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:10.900]  He was also talking about setting up the eugenics society. He was saying now Christianity is politically incorrect because it teaches individualism.
[02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:18.900]  And it's anything that teaches individualism is what they don't want because they want us in that collective mindset of the mainstream illusion and want us to plug into their electronics devices.
[02:55:18.900 --> 02:55:20.900]  Unfortunately, you know, kind of-
[02:55:20.900 --> 02:55:29.900]  Well, it's not that electronics are even evil. It's how they're engineering them is their main bend. They engineer tracking control that you then pay for when you buy it.
[02:55:29.900 --> 02:55:35.900]  And then there's a new headline yesterday. I forgot to bring up that they're saying now that electronic devices are coming with malware.
[02:55:35.900 --> 02:55:44.900]  And did you see that headline? It was from last night I saw it. And that more than likely in the next year, we're going to see a lot of phones being hacked through these malware.
[02:55:44.900 --> 02:55:55.900]  Well, no, no, that's how they spun it. Oh my gosh, all the major products hackers can get in. Well, that's because the government under the Telecommunications Act of 96, it's law that the backdoors are there.
[02:55:55.900 --> 02:56:00.900]  Yeah, they're going to stage a bunch of hackings. They're going to do it. It's on its horizon. I mean, we're seeing that coming over the horizon right now.
[02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:04.900]  Well, that's what the Cybersecurity Base in San Antonio is, is to launch their attacks.
[02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:05.900]  Military City, USA.
[02:56:05.900 --> 02:56:12.900]  And then Apple has a patent to stop your video from recording camera, from recording video. Stopping your cell phones from recording video at a-
[02:56:12.900 --> 02:56:15.900]  No, they admit the cops just hit a button and all electronics turns off.
[02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:18.900]  Yeah, that's going to be spread everywhere. That's going to be spread. I mean, that's not good.
[02:56:18.900 --> 02:56:27.900]  Maybe I shouldn't give you those lower tech cameras. We need to keep all this, quote, old tech because they're engineering spy grids and AI systems into everything.
[02:56:27.900 --> 02:56:37.900]  And that's why they're going to drones. That's why they're getting away from actual troops because soon that's why they wrote the future won't need us because the globalists are going to have their mechanized system.
[02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:41.900]  Yeah, they're going to commit some bad evil with those robots they're creating, too.
[02:56:41.900 --> 02:56:44.900]  Well, they're trying to keep... No, not evil. Peace.
[02:56:44.900 --> 02:56:45.900]  Yeah, my bad, my bad.
[02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:47.900]  War is peace, my friend.
[02:56:47.900 --> 02:56:48.900]  War is good.
[02:56:48.900 --> 02:56:54.900]  You're talking about the robots, the AI, they're going to be our butlers, aren't they? Like in the Jetsons and like all the science fiction.
[02:56:54.900 --> 02:56:56.900]  Oh, you know, everything was perfect.
[02:56:56.900 --> 02:57:00.900]  Well, no, they are going to be your butler in the first wave, but it's spying on you the whole time.
[02:57:00.900 --> 02:57:05.900]  You already see that in all the cell phones and all the architecture under global standardization.
[02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:06.900]  Yeah.
[02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:10.900]  They wouldn't do something secret. They've been taking baby's blood for 39 years secretly now, admit it.
[02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:11.900]  Yeah, they wouldn't lie to us.
[02:57:11.900 --> 02:57:16.900]  By the way, they store the blood samples for most of the US in San Antonio.
[02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:18.900]  Yeah, I'm sure they do.
[02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:20.900]  And it's insane.
[02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:21.900]  Isn't that loving?
[02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:28.900]  Yeah, it's loving over there in San Antonio, military city USA with four bases and NSA and oh my gosh, but we're doing...
[02:57:28.900 --> 02:57:29.900]  And Microsoft?
[02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:37.900]  Microsoft and then the university there in San Antonio has a specific cybersecurity course that they've spent billions or millions on.
[02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:39.900]  So, I mean, they're definitely gearing out.
[02:57:39.900 --> 02:57:42.900]  They're setting up a military factory in San Antonio.
[02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:47.900]  There are the rogue little weird, changed San Antonio family, you know, wandering the streets.
[02:57:47.900 --> 02:57:56.900]  Well, you're the white blood cells recognizing the cancer and the cancer saying, no, no, no, I'm taking over my country, my world.
[02:57:56.900 --> 02:58:01.900]  Take your shots, drink your sodium fluoride, drink your bisphenol, a lace plastic.
[02:58:01.900 --> 02:58:03.900]  I'm going to kill you, Medina.
[02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:05.900]  We're saying I don't think so.
[02:58:05.900 --> 02:58:06.900]  Bring it on.
[02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:07.900]  I mean, that's what, yeah, they want a war.
[02:58:07.900 --> 02:58:08.900]  They're going to get a war.
[02:58:08.900 --> 02:58:13.900]  They need us as biological androids to finish their electronic construct.
[02:58:13.900 --> 02:58:19.900]  And then they're going to get rid of us, they say, in the next evolutionary step in their religion of eugenics and death.
[02:58:19.900 --> 02:58:22.900]  That's what Ray Kurzweil talks about, the singularity that come in a...
[02:58:22.900 --> 02:58:23.900]  We don't have long, though.
[02:58:23.900 --> 02:58:24.900]  Yeah.
[02:58:24.900 --> 02:58:31.900]  And all you cops and servants of this and even you globalist technicians that know this but think you're part of the chosen ones, you're not.
[02:58:31.900 --> 02:58:34.900]  You didn't get a memo about bisphenol, eh, did you?
[02:58:34.900 --> 02:58:41.900]  This main transmission is over, Mike Adams filling in tomorrow, we have a special great broadcast Friday lined up for you.
[02:58:41.900 --> 02:58:43.900]  Back in one minute.
[02:58:43.900 --> 02:58:46.900]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.900 --> 02:58:51.900]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:51.900 --> 02:58:56.900]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.900 --> 02:58:59.900]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.900 --> 02:59:04.900]  As we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:04.900 --> 02:59:10.900]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.900 --> 02:59:15.900]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:59:15.900 --> 02:59:19.900]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:59:19.900 --> 02:59:25.900]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:59:25.900 --> 02:59:29.900]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches.
[02:59:29.900 --> 02:59:32.900]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.900 --> 02:59:34.900]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.900 --> 02:59:39.900]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:39.900 --> 02:59:44.900]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[02:59:44.900 --> 02:59:59.900]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:00:14.900 --> 03:00:21.900]  Well, I want to thank Rachel Frantz.
[03:00:21.900 --> 03:00:24.900]  I want to thank Matthew Medina and Cody Hess for coming in.
[03:00:24.900 --> 03:00:25.900]  You guys are doing a great job.
[03:00:25.900 --> 03:00:31.900]  I want to get Aaron to pop in because you have the Eugenics Society in this book, Worshipping Aldous Huxley.
[03:00:31.900 --> 03:00:35.900]  This is the progenitor of Ray Kurzweil and all the rest of them saying,
[03:00:35.900 --> 03:00:41.900]  you know, if humans are even allowed to stay around will be pets of the globalists that have merged with machines.
[03:00:41.900 --> 03:00:44.900]  And of course, that's the co-founder of Apple saying that.
[03:00:44.900 --> 03:00:49.900]  And that's why you have folks like Bill Joy who went to meetings and says,
[03:00:49.900 --> 03:00:53.900]  I was with 200 top technology owners and they said, do we kill everybody?
[03:00:53.900 --> 03:00:56.900]  I mean, this is all and the decision has been made.
[03:00:56.900 --> 03:00:58.900]  Yes. So the cancer's doubled the last 10 years.
[03:00:58.900 --> 03:01:01.900]  The diabetes, people are dying all around us.
[03:01:01.900 --> 03:01:02.900]  It's only going to get worse.
[03:01:02.900 --> 03:01:04.900]  We're all being killed incrementally.
[03:01:04.900 --> 03:01:08.900]  Aaron Dyches has now researched this one area probably deeper than I even have.
[03:01:08.900 --> 03:01:12.900]  He just has read probably a hundred of their own writings.
[03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:15.900]  Aaron, they think they've got us.
[03:01:15.900 --> 03:01:18.900]  What's your take on this?
[03:01:18.900 --> 03:01:27.900]  Well, the eugenics system really is the world state declaring over 100 years ago that they have the right to control our life processes.
[03:01:27.900 --> 03:01:30.900]  Who gets to breed? Who gets to live? Who gets to die?
[03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:37.900]  You know, George Bernard Shaw talked about how under socialism you'd be forcibly fed, clothes fed.
[03:01:37.900 --> 03:01:41.900]  And if you weren't good enough, you'd be kindly exterminated.
[03:01:41.900 --> 03:01:42.900]  Well, it's that same system.
[03:01:42.900 --> 03:01:44.900]  Now they have the machine, so bye-bye.
[03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:46.900]  Eugenics is that system.
[03:01:46.900 --> 03:01:49.900]  Thing is, the elite don't need us. Life's always been cheap.
[03:01:49.900 --> 03:01:51.900]  Now it's something toxic.
[03:01:51.900 --> 03:01:53.900]  That's why we're being taught humans are evil.
[03:01:53.900 --> 03:01:56.900]  So we'll accept, oh, we're dying for Earth.
[03:01:56.900 --> 03:02:03.900]  He talked about Bertrand Russell, who is connected with Julian Huxley on this UNESCO project,
[03:02:03.900 --> 03:02:09.900]  which is education, science, culture, the whole thing, your whole life revolves around this eugenics idea.
[03:02:09.900 --> 03:02:16.900]  And then here it is in this eugenics society appraisal of Julian Huxley, brother of Alice Huxley's life.
[03:02:16.900 --> 03:02:21.900]  And chapter 13 is Julian Huxley and Eugenics, which he wrote extensively on.
[03:02:21.900 --> 03:02:24.900]  And they have one quote from a Dean Inge, who says,
[03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:32.900]  Eugenics is capable of becoming the most sacred ideal of the human race as a race, one of the supreme religious duties.
[03:02:32.900 --> 03:02:38.900]  Huxley says, I agree entirely. One of the implications of evolutionary biology are grasped.
[03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:42.900]  Eugenics will inevitably become part of the religion of the future,
[03:02:42.900 --> 03:02:47.900]  or whatever complex of sentiments may in the future take the place of organized religion.
[03:02:47.900 --> 03:02:50.900]  And Bertrand Russell wrote about the same thing as part of this eugenic...
[03:02:50.900 --> 03:02:55.900]  And their religion is, by definition, do as thou wilt. We will go on willing. We will kill all of you.
[03:02:55.900 --> 03:03:01.900]  We will merge with machines. I don't believe in God, not yet. I will be your God. I am Ray Kurzweil.
[03:03:01.900 --> 03:03:02.900]  Yeah, but Bertrand...
[03:03:02.900 --> 03:03:06.900]  And then they write about how they're all going to kill each other, too. It's going to be one, one, one left.
[03:03:06.900 --> 03:03:09.900]  There's going to be one Lucifer left, kill everything else.
[03:03:09.900 --> 03:03:14.900]  And part of this, too, Bertrand Russell talks about after a generation of state-controlled education,
[03:03:14.900 --> 03:03:21.900]  children will believe snow is black, you know, whatever they tell them, anything, and smart students will either become part of this hiveborg,
[03:03:21.900 --> 03:03:25.900]  or they'll be killed. Only the education will only be for the elite.
[03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:31.900]  But that's liberal. And liberals call me that, but it's liberal. It's liberal. Kill everyone, liberal.
[03:03:31.900 --> 03:03:32.900]  It's trendy.
[03:03:32.900 --> 03:03:33.900]  It's the way of the future.
[03:03:33.900 --> 03:03:34.900]  It's what everyone's doing.
[03:03:34.900 --> 03:03:35.900]  Yeah.
[03:03:35.900 --> 03:03:39.900]  It's in the commercials. It's in the movies. It's in the music. It's in the music videos.
[03:03:39.900 --> 03:03:44.900]  But it's that whole 1984 re-education system admitted, and we're told that it's good.
[03:03:44.900 --> 03:03:47.900]  Yeah, Bertrand Russell will be blessed by the Scientific Society.
[03:03:47.900 --> 03:03:53.900]  He's talking about making engineering society like these. These guys engineer society, cultures, and we've been trying to expose it.
[03:03:53.900 --> 03:03:58.900]  We had Runnans Alex with the Foundation-funded activist group a year and a half ago.
[03:03:58.900 --> 03:04:05.900]  We were talking about it during the Robert Rodriguez machete during that time, because, you know, the public, you know, believe...
[03:04:05.900 --> 03:04:11.900]  They believe the Foundation-funded activist groups are fed the story that the white man's the enemy.
[03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:14.900]  And, you know, it's indigenous people versus the white people.
[03:04:14.900 --> 03:04:18.900]  And that's a real fight. And, you know, the political beliefs is socialist.
[03:04:18.900 --> 03:04:22.900]  And then that's funded by the actual globalists that are spiking their vaccines.
[03:04:22.900 --> 03:04:24.900]  So they can go, we're your friend. We hate white people.
[03:04:24.900 --> 03:04:27.900]  By the way, the big mega corporations run us. Now take these shots.
[03:04:27.900 --> 03:04:31.900]  Yeah. And we had a run-in with a person like that on the street, San Antonio, during the street action.
[03:04:31.900 --> 03:04:36.900]  We had that video on the Weird Change San Antonio YouTube channel. It's called a quote, Info Wars is Racist.
[03:04:36.900 --> 03:04:40.900]  And we run into one of these people and in the video, break it down, explain...
[03:04:40.900 --> 03:04:41.900]  I've seen the video, yeah.
[03:04:41.900 --> 03:04:48.900]  So that's just an example of social engineering. We're talking about engineering society and the scientific society.
[03:04:48.900 --> 03:04:50.900]  I mean, this is all well-documented.
[03:04:50.900 --> 03:04:54.900]  Well, it's playing us off against each other. We're out of time. All of you guys, great job.
[03:04:54.900 --> 03:04:57.900]  I know, Aaron, you shot a video on your new YouTube channel about that book, didn't you?
[03:04:57.900 --> 03:04:58.900]  Not about this book.
[03:04:58.900 --> 03:05:02.900]  We'll shoot one on it. It's important. Mike Adams, tomorrow.
