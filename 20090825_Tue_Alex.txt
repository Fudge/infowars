[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:38.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.800]  oh we've got a powerful transmission lined up for you today on this 25th day of
[00:44.800 --> 00:51.000]  August this Tuesday edition thank you so much for joining us on the 25th day of
[00:51.000 --> 00:58.600]  August 2009 we have Dr. Mayor Eisenstein who I've interviewed many times over the
[00:58.600 --> 01:02.880]  years but it's been probably two years since I've had him on he has one of the
[01:02.880 --> 01:13.840]  biggest practices medical practices in Illinois and he's one of people that's
[01:13.840 --> 01:18.360]  helped publish the studies showing that out of the hundreds of thousands of
[01:18.360 --> 01:24.880]  Amish that live in Illinois and surrounding states none of them have
[01:24.880 --> 01:32.280]  autism or the other brain degenerative diseases doesn't exist of course
[01:32.280 --> 01:38.440]  autism 50 years ago and back didn't exist either but now some schools a third
[01:38.440 --> 01:44.320]  of the children have it huge wings of people hit by the chemical weapons the
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.600]  chemical lobotomy takes hold a little bit a little bit stronger than it's meant
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.120]  to it's just meant to make you a subservient and docile and dull so we'll
[01:55.120 --> 02:02.080]  be breaking that down and tying it in to the mandatory swine flu inoculations
[02:02.080 --> 02:10.320]  that the government is proposing for the fall and I have a AP article also a
[02:10.320 --> 02:15.320]  French news agency article have similar headlines White House swine flu could
[02:15.320 --> 02:23.560]  kill 90,000 in the United States that's what they are predicting now the regular
[02:23.560 --> 02:30.920]  seasonal flu kills 36 plus thousand just shy of a few hundred of 37,000
[02:30.920 --> 02:33.840]  according to the Centers for Disease Control not talking to many different
[02:33.840 --> 02:38.240]  medical doctors and statisticians they say it's probably closer to 15,000 but
[02:38.240 --> 02:43.400]  a lot of 85 90 year old people that already have cancer or other
[02:43.400 --> 02:48.560]  complications and infections they'll get hit by the flu in the flu season and it
[02:48.560 --> 02:53.200]  will be the final thing that pushes them over the edge so you're really talking
[02:53.200 --> 02:57.440]  15,000 or so that really die the flu every year and it's normally low-income
[02:57.440 --> 03:02.320]  people that live alone because nobody can get them up out of bed after three
[03:02.320 --> 03:07.280]  days of not being able to drink water they basically pass out from dehydration
[03:07.280 --> 03:14.160]  and dying so why all the hype why all the fear less than 2,000 deaths in the US
[03:14.160 --> 03:19.640]  from swine flu less than 2,000 worldwide excuse me less than 200 nationwide in the
[03:19.640 --> 03:25.760]  US may have passed 200 it was 200 last week run or 200 why all the fear
[03:25.760 --> 03:31.880]  mongering why all the scare mongering it's a very very important question and
[03:31.880 --> 03:37.600]  all of us should be asking ourselves why all the pre-preparation before this
[03:37.600 --> 03:43.320]  flu was released clearly this is a staged event the question is how bad is
[03:43.320 --> 03:47.240]  the staged event going to be what are they planning we know it's staged but
[03:47.240 --> 03:51.160]  when we've got a good idea of what they're planning to stage but we know a
[03:51.160 --> 03:55.920]  staged events going on the details though still are somewhat nebulous
[03:55.920 --> 04:00.640]  though they're becoming more and more defined by the millisecond so that is
[04:00.640 --> 04:04.160]  our sole guest today we're gonna have open phones throughout the full four
[04:04.160 --> 04:07.880]  hours I'll give that number out coming up in the next segment their phones aren't
[04:07.880 --> 04:10.640]  open yet because I want to tell you about some of the other topics and
[04:10.640 --> 04:18.240]  important issues that affect humankind on this planetoid we call terra firma I
[04:18.240 --> 04:23.880]  have a huge stack of massive government censorship of the media the web

[08:10.880 --> 08:18.920]  well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[08:18.920 --> 08:33.920]  Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[08:33.920 --> 08:44.960]  she's at Martha's Vineyard raining on Obama the fake anti-war candidates
[08:44.960 --> 08:51.800]  parade and of course illustrating how the controlled corporate media only
[08:51.800 --> 08:58.280]  behaves like their anti-war occasionally right before an election so they can
[08:58.280 --> 09:03.280]  continue the illusion of choice in this country between the Republicans and the
[09:03.280 --> 09:10.520]  Democrats so they're illustrating the hypocrisy the fraud that is Barack H.
[09:10.520 --> 09:19.040]  Obama is Cindy Sheehan a bunch of other peace activists you can love him or hate
[09:19.040 --> 09:22.680]  him even if you were pro-war but you've got to respect the fact that she's not
[09:22.680 --> 09:26.120]  like the other peace activists that were foundation controlled big money
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.440]  controlled that were only anti-war when Bush was in power because there was no
[09:30.440 --> 09:46.200]  chance of stopping it that is coming up today in the middle of the second hour
[09:46.200 --> 09:50.480]  in the third hour I have a medical doctor Dr. Eisenstein coming on about
[09:50.480 --> 09:58.360]  the swine flu vaccine autism mercury in the vaccines and a lot more and
[09:58.360 --> 10:02.800]  remember how you heard the last six seven years that there was no mercury in
[10:02.800 --> 10:06.440]  vaccines it was a conspiracy theory but anytime you actually go to the doctor
[10:06.440 --> 10:11.320]  or to a vaccine vaccination clinic an inoculation clinic and you have to see
[10:11.320 --> 10:16.680]  the insert with the ampoules with the injectors it will tell you that there is
[10:16.680 --> 10:23.320]  the Marisol or mercury in it just all lies ladies and gentlemen that's what
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.880]  they do so we're going to cover the headline and the story White House says
[10:27.880 --> 10:32.760]  swine flu could kill 90,000 in the United States and these different
[10:32.760 --> 10:36.200]  international swine flu conferences with the federal government preparing mass
[10:36.200 --> 10:42.360]  graves mass quarantines lockdowns of US cities 400,000 regular army and marines
[10:42.360 --> 10:47.160]  to occupy the United States now that doesn't mean this is going to happen it
[10:47.160 --> 10:53.400]  means they're floating the trial balloon to see if the suckers will buy it and a
[10:53.400 --> 10:56.840]  lot of people aren't but the establishment is behaving as if they're
[10:56.840 --> 11:01.200]  going to continue this also Admiral Mullen is worried over public support for
[11:01.200 --> 11:05.720]  Afghan war that's why he's running around all over TV lying to people with
[11:05.720 --> 11:09.640]  psyops against the enemy which is the American people Pentagon admits they
[11:09.640 --> 11:13.880]  work for foreign offshore banks and their job in psych warfare is to make
[11:13.880 --> 11:17.560]  sure the troops don't wake up and the people don't wake up and he's there
[11:17.560 --> 11:23.720]  again posing and prancing around on stage in his fancy admirals uniform like
[11:23.720 --> 11:27.880]  something out of a Latin American third world dictatorship would wear he's up
[11:27.880 --> 11:31.160]  there prancing around with like 14 stars on his shoulder likes again like some
[11:31.160 --> 11:36.520]  Mexican dictator or something or Guatemalan or North Korean dictator or I
[11:36.520 --> 11:42.720]  guess Eastern Bloc dictator so Mullen worried over public support for Afghan
[11:42.720 --> 11:48.440]  war Afghan conflict seriously deteriorating says Mullen all it is is a
[11:48.440 --> 11:52.240]  bunch of different warlords fighting over the opium I mean you got 400 500
[11:52.240 --> 11:59.880]  billion a year conservatively coming out of there and opium and smack for stupid
[11:59.880 --> 12:02.520]  Western kids to use I mean you know this is important
[12:02.520 --> 12:06.520]  Admiral Mullen's got a job bring that smack in you're not gonna let other
[12:06.520 --> 12:12.920]  warlords have it come on so that's the job here he's a businessman and if it
[12:12.920 --> 12:18.520]  takes a few thousand dead American troops so be it they signed up for it they
[12:18.520 --> 12:22.800]  signed up to be injected with cancer viruses as well renditions may continue
[12:22.800 --> 12:27.040]  under interrogation unit New York Times spins this article about wonderful
[12:27.040 --> 12:32.680]  secret arrest secret torture in foreign Eastern European death dungeons so we'll
[12:32.680 --> 12:39.480]  go over that also you better not criticize Obama about that though look
[12:39.480 --> 12:46.800]  at this Times of London article you know we here in America see these pundits
[12:46.800 --> 12:55.120]  like Chris Matthews and Carlos Watson and Rachel Maddow and Keith Oberman and
[12:55.120 --> 12:59.280]  countless others and they're doing it on CNN now too but they're really bad on
[12:59.280 --> 13:06.480]  MSNBC and they say don't use the word socialist it's code for inward and now
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.760]  you see all over the country they're pulling down the Obama Joker posters in
[13:11.760 --> 13:18.240]  the news saying here's a headline freedom of hate speech or possible hate crime
[13:18.240 --> 13:23.840]  if this is from Texas to Florida to New York everywhere because the general
[13:23.840 --> 13:30.640]  public if you told a certain percentage of the general public to go jump off a
[13:30.640 --> 13:36.920]  cliff or their racist they would literally go drunk jump off cliffs because
[13:36.920 --> 13:41.440]  it's all they love their white guilt they live for it and then there's people
[13:41.440 --> 13:46.720]  who live to invoke it the poverty pimps the big Annenberg and Ford Foundation
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.200]  pimps like Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party in
[13:51.200 --> 13:57.000]  general but Republicans use it as well Barack Obama is a master of it and they
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.200]  just invoke it they just hold up the idol of race and say you're not allowed to
[14:02.200 --> 14:06.680]  have an opinion on politics you're not allowed to be politically involved or
[14:06.680 --> 14:14.920]  you are a racist and in Europe well first they ban denying the Holocaust first
[14:14.920 --> 14:20.320]  they ban running around doing the Hitler salute 30 years ago it sounded
[14:20.320 --> 14:25.840]  reasonable you know a bunch of skinheads running around screaming howl Hitler
[14:25.840 --> 14:31.160]  it's it's unsavory but even if you disagree with a bunch of drunken skin
[14:31.160 --> 14:37.280]  heads and suspenders screaming and yelling howl Hitler you know hail 88
[14:37.280 --> 14:42.360]  and the rest of it if you take their right to free speech it's over they're
[14:42.360 --> 14:46.920]  gonna take your right and now they've already passed laws in several European
[14:46.920 --> 14:52.320]  countries they send police to question you even in England it's starting if you
[14:52.320 --> 14:57.760]  deny man-made global warming I take Robin Page BBC presenter I use that
[14:57.760 --> 15:01.760]  example a lot because there's readily available articles on it we had him on
[15:01.760 --> 15:06.080]  the show we had to get it home get Robin Page host of one man and his dog back
[15:06.080 --> 15:10.840]  on I know that show still very popular show for decades very long-running he
[15:10.840 --> 15:15.840]  would travel to different towns by foot every week's episode and then sample
[15:15.840 --> 15:25.120]  their local beers their local micro bros and sample their local dishes he spoke
[15:25.120 --> 15:30.100]  at a rural affairs outdoor conference where they were banning all forms of
[15:30.100 --> 15:37.720]  hunting and ancestral type activity cultural identity and he said you know
[15:37.720 --> 15:43.480]  by the way he's a liberal he said he said we rural communities deserve the
[15:43.480 --> 15:48.920]  same rights as Muslims and homosexuals they came and arrested him and said the
[15:48.920 --> 15:55.000]  word homosexual has been deemed painful heterosexual homosexual they arrest you
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.240]  in Europe if you use the word Negro Anglo Negro these are just scientific
[15:59.240 --> 16:05.240]  words but the public is so dumb down and so religious that the government can
[16:05.240 --> 16:09.680]  say well now they're expanding it in England in Scotland and in Ireland under
[16:09.680 --> 16:19.840]  EU rules it says black ball oops sorry veto racist everyday phrases times of
[16:19.840 --> 16:27.440]  London headline it could be construed as a black day for the English language but
[16:27.440 --> 16:32.240]  not if you work in the public sector now black day does not mean racist black day
[16:32.240 --> 16:37.680]  means it's a dark day clouds hanging over no it's a bright day but see they
[16:37.680 --> 16:41.520]  they want to make you think along racial lines they're the ones invoking race
[16:41.520 --> 16:48.120]  and class and separation they invoke it as the imperial great game of divide and
[16:48.120 --> 16:52.640]  conquer in the name of fighting it so so now people do take offense you say man
[16:52.640 --> 17:00.240]  it's a black day or dark day indeed you know Darth Vader is wearing a shiny
[17:00.240 --> 17:07.840]  black kind of hybrid samurai outfit that's really what it's modeled after I
[17:07.840 --> 17:11.400]  mean is that anti-Japanese is an anti-black person no it's been to
[17:11.400 --> 17:18.240]  radiate power tall dark and handsome it's again but they make they make dark see
[17:18.240 --> 17:21.400]  by doing this the way to counter them and nobody does this is with the truth
[17:21.400 --> 17:25.560]  you don't say that's ridiculous dark day means a lot of clouds you go you're
[17:25.560 --> 17:31.360]  invoking race you're race pimping you're dividing people Darth Vader has a
[17:31.360 --> 17:38.320]  black armored exoskeleton because black is seen as ominous and powerful Darth
[17:38.320 --> 17:44.440]  Vader means dark father in some northern European language I forget is it Dutch
[17:44.440 --> 17:52.080]  the issue here is that but yes there are now discussions in Europe about it's
[17:52.080 --> 17:57.960]  wrong to have Darth Vader being black it means you it's racist so when they come
[17:57.960 --> 18:01.560]  out and they say it's it's racist to say the word socialist or it's racist to
[18:01.560 --> 18:04.960]  criticize Obama and that's all over the news now they just say you're just
[18:04.960 --> 18:09.040]  racist it isn't that I'm against Obama because he's anti-gun or pro-global
[18:09.040 --> 18:14.400]  carbon tax and eugenics or double the funding for forced abortions in China
[18:14.400 --> 18:20.360]  and abortions in in in Africa no see really killing black people really
[18:20.360 --> 18:24.880]  actually murdering them with soft kill vaccines that that's a good thing
[18:24.880 --> 18:30.040]  according to these people because when Carlos Watson and and and all these other
[18:30.040 --> 18:35.680]  guys get up on TV and they say you're a racist if you criticize Obama they know

[26:16.040 --> 26:19.560]  floors and all their facilities now the government just says no you know what

[27:41.640 --> 27:45.480]  introduced all these anti-gun bills and they deny they've introduced them or
[27:45.480 --> 27:48.280]  just like they deny they're building mass graves preparing for
[27:48.280 --> 27:53.520]  synoculations while they openly been set it up it's the same thing here well
[27:53.520 --> 27:59.280]  here's the New York Times today FTC to assess business of news federal trade
[27:59.280 --> 28:03.320]  commission is going to talk about regulating to the commerce clause the

[28:08.640 --> 28:13.960]  deciding what is accurate and what is it and how to regulate blogs exactly what
[28:13.960 --> 28:17.720]  senator J. Rockefeller's called for saying we'd be better off not having an
[28:17.720 --> 28:23.160]  internet these people mean business and if you don't think they can shut the
[28:23.160 --> 28:27.600]  web down here's just one way you know they don't let Google phone now used by
[28:27.600 --> 28:30.360]  tens of millions of people basically it's free unless you would do far and
[28:30.360 --> 28:36.440]  long distance then it's near close to free texting is free on those networks
[28:36.440 --> 28:40.080]  because it doesn't cost the company's anything it's already on the backbone
[28:40.080 --> 28:48.560]  the way it's explained by IT people AT&T and iPhone Apple will not allow
[28:48.560 --> 28:54.880]  Google phones to call iPhones see that's what the future of the web that phone
[28:54.880 --> 28:59.720]  system is on the internet that's how net neutrality ending works I just it just
[28:59.720 --> 29:05.200]  goes on and on ladies and gentlemen it's already happening you understand and

[29:09.000 --> 29:13.480]  decide what's news and what isn't it isn't enough they spend tens of billions
[29:13.480 --> 29:18.120]  a year on fake news and news packages under Clinton and Bush and now under
[29:18.120 --> 29:25.080]  Obama it's worse fake news this is bipartisan now they want to restrict our

[33:42.160 --> 33:47.260]  was this archetypal shot even though it's all heavily CIA scripted and the
[33:47.260 --> 33:55.300]  rest of it the shot of Bernanke from the pool camera was through the
[33:55.300 --> 34:00.540]  teleprompter and he looks like some type of blue-skinned gamelon or something he
[34:00.540 --> 34:04.540]  looks like a complete devil and also just illustrates how it's all staged the
[34:04.540 --> 34:15.260]  great teleprompter shot that I just saw in fact we were we just so happen to be

[35:40.740 --> 35:53.820]  to but FTC to assess business of news New York Times just about everyone from
[35:53.820 --> 35:57.900]  the general public to news executives has an opinion about the future of
[35:57.900 --> 36:01.140]  journalism now the federal trade commission is stepping into the debate
[36:01.140 --> 36:05.860]  oh we're glad the trade commission is gonna be over our free speech now the
[36:05.860 --> 36:08.980]  commission is planning two days of workshops in December titled from
[36:08.980 --> 36:15.380]  town criers to bloggers how will journalism survive the internet age
[36:15.380 --> 36:20.380]  all the government's going to decide they they're the experts to examine the
[36:20.380 --> 36:24.500]  state of the news industry and you read into this article it says you know they
[36:24.500 --> 36:30.700]  may need to license bloggers they may need to control what we do more often
[36:30.700 --> 36:35.740]  the FTC tends to organize workshops related to consumer product issues like
[36:35.740 --> 36:42.140]  mortgage fraud but John Liebowitz the FTC chairman said the agency has taken a
[36:42.140 --> 36:46.180]  look at other industries the workshops on hospital competition food marketing
[36:46.180 --> 36:50.780]  and the patent system journalism's future falls in the agency's purview he
[36:50.780 --> 36:56.580]  said oh we're glad that the future of free speech is you know under you
[36:56.580 --> 37:02.060]  competition among news organizations involves more than just price oh they're
[37:02.060 --> 37:07.180]  gonna decide more than just how it's delivered to you on cable and things oh
[37:07.180 --> 37:13.380]  mr. Liebowitz said in interview disclosure mr. Liebowitz is married to
[37:13.380 --> 37:17.980]  Ruth Marcus an editor at the Washington Post on but he said the commissioners
[37:17.980 --> 37:21.420]  who are a mix of Democrats and Republicans are supportive of his
[37:21.420 --> 37:25.820]  workshops oh that's a little focus group oh the people we had a little expert
[37:25.820 --> 37:30.020]  panel and they agree we should take over because if you actually read what he's
[37:30.020 --> 37:33.740]  been saying he's saying you can just google his name and license bloggers
[37:33.740 --> 37:37.940]  then you'll you'll see it though some may be uncomfortable with government
[37:37.940 --> 37:42.500]  oversight of any aspect of journalism oh some see see they minimize with
[37:42.500 --> 37:45.780]  deceptive words well you have no jurisdiction under the first amendment
[37:45.780 --> 37:50.140]  you stupid twit well you're not stupid you cold-blooded anti-american piece of
[37:50.140 --> 37:55.660]  filth I mean we got real hardcore commas are here look every day I probably see

[37:59.820 --> 38:04.820]  of exaggerating we're under full-bore assault by the New World Order here
[38:04.820 --> 38:08.380]  people they're openly announcing banks of the world and carbon taxes and home
[38:08.380 --> 38:13.380]  inspectors and everything else this isn't a go man I'm getting sick of this

[38:46.220 --> 38:51.100]  president boycott him and all the mainstream newspapers and international
[38:51.100 --> 38:55.060]  Spanish-speaking TV saying it you people are sick

[38:59.460 --> 39:04.140]  not going to shut me up or anybody else up you understand me criminals you think
[39:04.140 --> 39:07.060]  calling for my arrest all over the news is going to shut me up you pieces of
[39:07.060 --> 39:10.300]  trash that only confirms everything I've said is true and correct and then
[39:10.300 --> 39:14.420]  everybody's got to get together against you right now
[39:14.420 --> 39:27.940]  I just can't handle any more these people make me so sick listen to this
[39:27.940 --> 39:32.220]  though some see the act like now it's a minority issue and you're not that it's
[39:32.220 --> 39:36.340]  an absolute guarantee it's well some may not like the government running what
[39:36.340 --> 39:41.060]  they can and can't say you know it's real good see and the government's going
[39:41.060 --> 39:44.660]  to implode and consolidate the media there's a vertical integration going on
[39:44.660 --> 39:47.660]  right now and they're going to tell the media you keep your job if you go along
[39:47.660 --> 39:53.060]  with censorship and then they're now all lining up to attack dog because most
[39:53.060 --> 39:57.780]  people sell their mother out for a stick of bubble gum though some may be
[39:57.780 --> 40:03.340]  uncomfortable with government oversight of any aspect of journalism yeah we're
[40:03.340 --> 40:05.940]  just upset that you've taken over the churches the clergy response teams
[40:05.940 --> 40:08.860]  against the First Amendment we're just upset they spend tens of billions a
[40:08.860 --> 40:13.060]  year in fake news and propaganda and product placement government product
[40:13.060 --> 40:16.900]  placement government information placement I call propaganda placement
[40:16.900 --> 40:24.300]  yeah as if that isn't enough and and as if four companies owning 94% and growing
[40:24.300 --> 40:28.140]  of the media and enough now we got to have government oversight over the six
[40:28.140 --> 40:31.140]  percent of us that are out there that are getting the entire audience because
[40:31.140 --> 40:34.100]  people figured out you're a pack of liars hey look it's too late for you
[40:34.100 --> 40:37.660]  criminals you could shut us all down today that probably only make people
[40:37.660 --> 40:43.860]  wake up faster your pieces of trash and folks they are pieces of trash I mean
[40:43.860 --> 40:46.220]  when they come out and start trying to restrict the First Amendment that means
[40:46.220 --> 40:49.380]  they want to take your property take your house take your kids put you in
[40:49.380 --> 40:54.400]  camps that's what comes next with this you understand they built those stinking
[40:54.400 --> 40:56.980]  camps they're in the news telling you how great they are for you right now
[40:56.980 --> 41:00.860]  though some may be uncomfortable with government oversight of any aspect of
[41:00.860 --> 41:08.260]  journalism the FTC seems to be attempting to play at facilitating a
[41:08.260 --> 41:11.540]  public educational role in gathering together various disciplines and
[41:11.540 --> 41:15.860]  perspectives to talk about the crisis in mainstream journalism said Neil Harry
[41:15.860 --> 41:19.220]  a professor and Dean at the Graduate School of Journalism the University
[41:19.220 --> 41:22.820]  California Berkeley yes some guy that writes one thing a month and gets a big
[41:22.820 --> 41:27.180]  paycheck some lazy person the government's willingness to raise the
[41:27.180 --> 41:30.620]  profile on the issue and to help explain why it's important for National
[41:30.620 --> 41:35.940]  Conversation I think in general is welcome oh great you got some tenured
[41:35.940 --> 41:41.300]  little pimp in the fake parasite system that doesn't produce anything telling us
[41:41.300 --> 41:45.740]  see all articles about introducing the idea oh well some may not like it but
[41:45.740 --> 41:50.740]  this professor he's smart and you're not he says people welcome this that being
[41:50.740 --> 41:55.580]  said the industry may still have to fend for itself for solutions to its major
[41:55.580 --> 42:00.820]  problems oh it has to fend for itself the government see that that's like oh we
[42:00.820 --> 42:04.900]  wish the government would get involved we're talking about government bailouts
[42:04.900 --> 42:11.180]  for mainstream media that in the end will be the work of journalists business
[42:11.180 --> 42:15.900]  thinkers entrepreneurs engineers theologist and people ourselves said
[42:15.900 --> 42:21.380]  Henry a report will be issued about the workshops that will make recommendations
[42:21.380 --> 42:25.340]  the lawmakers on changes in policies on anything ranging from taxation of news
[42:25.340 --> 42:29.900]  organizations to copyright issues Mr. Leibowitz said he said no specific issues
[42:29.900 --> 42:33.140]  had been chosen but you go read what they're actually saying this is a white
[42:33.140 --> 42:39.260]  wash article they're talking about in fact I cover this a month ago license
[42:39.260 --> 42:43.020]  bloggers just just Google that term and there'll be a bunch of government and
[42:43.020 --> 42:46.580]  people and senators saying it print me a few thank you I don't want to just
[42:46.580 --> 42:52.620]  mention I want to have it thank you we really want to keep an open mind mr.
[42:52.620 --> 42:56.100]  Leibowitz said the workshops will help because we don't have a sense of
[42:56.100 --> 43:02.780]  empirical of the nature of the problem he said let me tell you the problem it's
[43:02.780 --> 43:07.220]  because everybody knows you're a pack of special interests come and I've got
[43:07.220 --> 43:13.500]  another FTC article they're talking about regulating the news oh here's one
[43:13.500 --> 43:17.260]  swine flu could strain US health care system White House says that's why we
[43:17.260 --> 43:21.260]  need socialized health care that's exactly what the congressman have been
[43:21.260 --> 43:26.180]  saying Paul Brown and former congressman army I'm not saying army's perfect I'm
[43:26.180 --> 43:29.580]  just quoting what he said and he's saying the government's gonna use this to
[43:29.580 --> 43:32.620]  pass socialized health care and that's right that's what I've been saying for
[43:32.620 --> 43:37.420]  the last six seven months they're gonna use this flu crisis for everything and
[43:37.420 --> 43:41.940]  I've been saying that before it showed up I saw their preconditioning we're gonna
[43:41.940 --> 43:47.700]  go over that but getting back into free speech then your phone calls the
[43:47.700 --> 43:51.900]  establishment means business ladies and gentlemen that's why they're all over
[43:51.900 --> 43:55.820]  the news calling me a hate criminal freedom of hate speech calling for my
[43:55.820 --> 44:04.580]  arrest in all these different newspapers in Florida in Orlando in Claremont in
[44:04.580 --> 44:12.060]  Hayes County all over on international Spanish TV we've posted those clips and
[44:12.060 --> 44:15.620]  when you see them when they email us and they call and they already done it to
[44:15.620 --> 44:19.300]  some of our sponsors and they've already done our sponsors just increase the
[44:19.300 --> 44:22.460]  amount they're spending on the show because they're not giving in to tyranny
[44:22.460 --> 44:28.340]  they're not giving in to just a few fake phone calls from people and that's all
[44:28.340 --> 44:32.580]  this is these are people that if they can intimidate free speech in America they
[44:32.580 --> 44:36.100]  they will legally shut it down through fraudulent laws they will do it
[44:36.100 --> 44:40.020]  legislatively and they're doing this to everybody they they are bullying
[44:40.020 --> 44:45.260]  everybody they're getting radio show shut down they're going after independent
[44:45.260 --> 44:51.260]  newspapers they I mean if you criticize the president in any way they start
[44:51.260 --> 44:55.940]  threatening you they are coming to town hall meetings on video in outside
[44:55.940 --> 44:58.780]  st. Louis and other places you can just people always when I mention that say
[44:58.780 --> 45:03.220]  where's the video well learn to use a search engine just type Obama supporters
[45:03.220 --> 45:07.620]  attack man Obama supporters attack woman I mean there's a whole bunch of these
[45:07.620 --> 45:11.900]  they come up punch you in the nose then the media later reports that you attacked
[45:11.900 --> 45:16.940]  them so it's it's it's remember Obama during the campaign in Vermont in
[45:16.940 --> 45:21.020]  Illinois and Missouri said don't criticize Obama or you'll be arrested it's
[45:21.020 --> 45:25.140]  illegal and they had police on the news announcing it we got a clip of that in
[45:25.140 --> 45:33.780]  the new trailer for fall the Republic this is really going on and you know I
[45:33.780 --> 45:40.220]  didn't get as much resistance under Bush with people saying arrest me shut me
[45:40.220 --> 45:46.580]  down I got some of it and you know I don't like Glenn Beck he said arrest
[45:46.580 --> 45:52.060]  people that are these 9-11 truthers he said they're terrorists they're dangerous
[45:52.060 --> 45:57.140]  when you the army to watch them showing he was reading internal homeland
[45:57.140 --> 46:00.860]  security reports that later became public under Obama and that stuff was put
[46:00.860 --> 46:07.100]  out under Bush the my report in the homeland security report so it's
[46:07.100 --> 46:12.260]  bipartisan and he came out and so did MSNBC they said taser the 9-11 truthers
[46:12.260 --> 46:16.220]  arrest them don't let them stand on street corners and they staged an event
[46:16.220 --> 46:20.220]  where they came out of the shadows in New York with a lady in a wheelchair ran
[46:20.220 --> 46:26.180]  it in to German talus thank God the Secret Service wouldn't lie on the stand
[46:26.180 --> 46:29.420]  and admitted that actually they'd attacked him and the whole trial fell
[46:29.420 --> 46:33.980]  apart he was found not guilty yes we have people coming out of shadows with
[46:33.980 --> 46:38.300]  wheelchairs on us I have feds coming up and asking me if I want to attack the
[46:38.300 --> 46:43.700]  State Department you know and if I said yes I'd be arrested instantly or if I
[46:43.700 --> 46:48.580]  even joked around and said oh sure we've I mean this is real ladies and
[46:48.580 --> 46:55.100]  gentlemen and so but even though Bexon operative they are using him as a case
[46:55.100 --> 46:59.820]  point example in fact it may even be his job with his 50 million dollar contract
[46:59.820 --> 47:05.460]  to be destroyed I don't know but now he's a figurehead for free speech he
[47:05.460 --> 47:11.740]  must be defended you understand that I don't think savage is a figurehead I
[47:11.740 --> 47:15.140]  think he genuinely believes the stuff he says I agree with about 80% of it the
[47:15.140 --> 47:18.740]  point is when they tried to boycott him and tried to ban him from England I came
[47:18.740 --> 47:24.460]  out in support of him even though he'd called for arresting anti-war
[47:24.460 --> 47:29.420]  demonstrators it doesn't matter I support the anti-war people I support
[47:29.420 --> 47:33.740]  Glenn Beck I support the black panthers some of their groups saying you know all
[47:33.740 --> 47:37.940]  whites are evil of course that's foundation funded racial division to
[47:37.940 --> 47:42.460]  divide and conquer but liberation theology but I will just expose it
[47:42.460 --> 47:48.780]  because if I take their right away if I take a Nazis right there are some
[47:48.780 --> 47:52.660]  Jewish extremist groups that call for my arrest and stuff on YouTube I don't
[47:52.660 --> 47:56.580]  call for their free speech to be taken because if you take anybody's free
[47:56.580 --> 48:01.660]  speech away it's over you're supposed to let free speech go to ridiculous
[48:01.660 --> 48:06.980]  links until you call for violence on somebody else and then it's even
[48:06.980 --> 48:13.460]  protected if it's if it's in self-defense you understand so we have
[48:13.460 --> 48:20.220]  this absolutely anti-American anti-liberty anti-renaissance anti-freedom
[48:20.220 --> 48:29.020]  Soviet commissar who just absolutely makes me sick who talks about racial
[48:29.020 --> 48:34.020]  division black nationalism which was funded by the foundations they said
[48:34.020 --> 48:36.940]  a hundred years ago on record with Margaret Sanger and others on record
[48:36.940 --> 48:45.820]  they funded WDB Du Bois and others EB Du Bois is all on record that how do we
[48:45.820 --> 48:49.220]  get blacks to leave we can't force them back to Africa they said fun black
[48:49.220 --> 48:53.780]  nationalism make them stay separate that's why real white supremacists
[48:53.780 --> 48:57.980]  should love the Ford Foundation you should love black nationalist and
[48:57.980 --> 49:01.100]  actually they the Klan and black nationalist groups have had joint
[49:01.100 --> 49:04.620]  meetings together they go you stay in your group I stay in mine and I'm not up
[49:04.620 --> 49:08.300]  here preaching everybody to go get intermarried that's your issue the
[49:08.300 --> 49:14.860]  point is that this is what it is and so you see these guys that say blacks stick
[49:14.860 --> 49:20.580]  to themselves they're just as racist as a as a as a grand wizard I mean why not
[49:20.580 --> 49:25.060]  call these people what they are and that's what black men see now you start
[49:25.060 --> 49:29.740]  talking to him like this they melt like the witch in the wizard of Oz folks you
[49:29.740 --> 49:33.140]  come with them and say I'm not a racist how dare you say I'm not allowed to
[49:33.140 --> 49:38.740]  criticize the president how dare you say socialism's racist that you know that's
[49:38.740 --> 49:42.820]  that's ridiculous and then and then say oh I love black people I promise I like
[49:42.820 --> 49:47.620]  you you're playing in you don't know you're a poverty pimp race pimp who
[49:47.620 --> 49:51.380]  wants people to think about race on every issue you're trying to chill free
[49:51.380 --> 49:55.660]  speech in America you're trying to make people get each other's throat you son
[49:55.660 --> 50:00.260]  of a bitch I've had enough of your racist crap I want to live in peace with
[50:00.260 --> 50:06.740]  people excuse me but they have to be said and that's what people like van
[50:06.740 --> 50:10.820]  Jones do I challenge him to come on here and debate me and to be a man and not
[50:10.820 --> 50:14.980]  to be a foundation funded race pimp who works for the White House and works for
[50:14.980 --> 50:22.340]  Nancy Pelosi that gangster I'm calling you out you coward van Jones I'm calling
[50:22.340 --> 50:27.660]  you out you race pimp you limousine liberal you people funded by the eugenicists
[50:27.660 --> 50:32.620]  that are killing and aborting your own people I'm calling all your groups out I
[50:32.620 --> 50:37.420]  know exactly what you are I understand exactly what you're doing and I want you
[50:37.420 --> 50:44.860]  to know I see you I see you and I know you see me and I know you're afraid
[50:44.860 --> 50:49.540]  because you should be afraid I bring liberty and light and freedom and
[50:49.540 --> 50:54.940]  vengeance against corruption you understand that and the American people
[50:54.940 --> 50:58.780]  of all race colors and creeds and religions are rising up to your
[50:58.780 --> 51:08.060]  charity in the new world order is war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a
[51:08.060 --> 51:12.420]  stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to
[51:12.420 --> 51:17.540]  say the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[51:17.540 --> 51:21.500]  for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging
[51:21.500 --> 51:26.140]  yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical

[54:41.980 --> 54:47.660]  divisions to play people off whatever group is dominant they go to the other
[54:47.660 --> 54:53.820]  sub tribes or districts it could be black on black muslim on christian you know
[54:53.820 --> 54:59.980]  people from the south against the north they play divisions off and they all
[54:59.980 --> 55:04.780]  know exactly what they're doing they're fully a hundred percent conscious of it
[55:04.780 --> 55:18.620]  I mean I read the article earlier on air out of the times of London where
[55:18.620 --> 55:22.780]  they're saying you're not allowed to say it's a dark day or a black day you're
[55:22.780 --> 55:30.220]  not allowed to say right hand that is considered racist now and it's meant to
[55:30.220 --> 55:36.100]  make you think about if you say hey I need to screw a light bulb in or I think
[55:36.100 --> 55:40.900]  I'm gonna paint this wall white or yeah there's a bunch of toothpaste on the
[55:40.900 --> 55:45.060]  ground everything you say you think about race first it's meant to when
[55:45.060 --> 55:49.260]  you're not even thinking about it's meant to make it a kingdom of racism and
[55:49.260 --> 55:53.660]  division and then these guys are the self-anointed high priest of this new
[55:53.660 --> 55:57.780]  superstition they're gonna tell you what can be said and what can't you can't say
[55:57.780 --> 56:00.940]  you're against the health care government health care you can't say the
[56:00.940 --> 56:06.580]  word socialism you can't say Obama's a liar you can't show Obama as the Joker
[56:06.580 --> 56:14.660]  you can't show bush because we the high priest of this new superstition are going
[56:14.660 --> 56:18.180]  to tell you what you can and can do I mean this is mind control this is
[56:18.180 --> 56:24.580]  reeducation this is how the Soviets took over Europe eastern and southern areas
[56:24.580 --> 56:30.220]  of Europe and central Europe I mean this has been done people that know
[56:30.220 --> 56:35.580]  history know exactly what this is and that's why I'm upset I mean they really
[56:35.580 --> 56:39.300]  mean to take our guns they really really do they they could do it they'd line you
[56:39.300 --> 56:42.380]  up and shoot you in pits I mean they really would I don't think they're
[56:42.380 --> 56:46.140]  gonna get that far but if they use the flu they might I mean these people mean
[56:46.140 --> 56:53.980]  business folks they are real they mean big business and their business is
[56:53.980 --> 57:01.580]  killing and enslavement and then I read about this van jones boycotting Beck
[57:01.900 --> 57:07.700]  shutting down his free speech and getting rid of 30 plus of his sponsors if
[57:07.700 --> 57:10.540]  we don't all stand up with Beck and stand up with others that are being
[57:10.540 --> 57:15.300]  boycotted these psychological terrorists are gonna destroy our free speech in
[57:15.300 --> 57:19.500]  America and of course I attacked Beck when he was trying to restrict my free
[57:19.500 --> 57:26.500]  speech attacking me by name before so as bad as Beck is he's being used as a
[57:26.500 --> 57:32.940]  sacrificial goat to set the precedent so you better defend this little creature
[57:32.940 --> 57:40.700]  and this van jones is just outrageous absolutely outrageous he has a group

[1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:30.980]  I'd like to talk about the internet and some of the things that you've been
[1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:37.380]  talking about for the last couple of days first off I need to try to point out
[1:01:37.380 --> 1:01:42.860]  something I don't know that most people understand there's a difference
[1:01:42.860 --> 1:01:49.420]  between and this isn't strictly true but it just tries to convey the idea there's
[1:01:49.420 --> 1:01:56.180]  a difference between what people perceive as the internet and the web the web is
[1:01:56.180 --> 1:02:03.980]  basically a bunch of privately owned connections sort of like the streets the
[1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:11.420]  internet in effect is the addressing system it gets you along those streets
[1:02:11.420 --> 1:02:16.260]  or that allows your mail to get from point A to point B yes and they can just
[1:02:16.260 --> 1:02:20.460]  change the addresses our blockout addresses and they're taking over the
[1:02:20.460 --> 1:02:25.220]  web hubs themselves publicly laughing at us while the public sucks their thumb
[1:02:25.220 --> 1:02:30.580]  and has no idea this is happening well now let's take it to the next step
[1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:35.500]  something that you haven't talked about and something that I think most people
[1:02:35.500 --> 1:02:41.660]  are missing okay so in the case of the web you're talking about a private
[1:02:41.660 --> 1:02:48.860]  system the case of the internet you're talking about something that's very odd
[1:02:48.860 --> 1:02:52.340]  talking about I can't I mean you're talking about the international right
[1:02:52.340 --> 1:02:58.740]  we're on head that's where I'm headed correct okay so it's a sort of public
[1:02:58.740 --> 1:03:04.900]  system but it's controlled by the US government yeah I can't okay I can't
[1:03:04.900 --> 1:03:12.740]  contract in September 30th that is in just a few weeks yeah big deal the news
[1:03:12.740 --> 1:03:19.780]  I'm sorry yeah it's a big deal right and the new CEO talking about getting it to
[1:03:19.780 --> 1:03:26.900]  the European Union well who knows where it's gonna go ahead make your point the
[1:03:26.900 --> 1:03:38.380]  new CEO go ahead new CEO is Rod Dextrum he's a former cyber security czar for
[1:03:38.380 --> 1:03:42.180]  Department of Homeland Security and he was one of the people considered to be
[1:03:42.180 --> 1:03:51.580]  in line for the top spot so that to me is a great concern well it's admitted the
[1:03:51.580 --> 1:03:57.380]  Pentagon DARPA created the internet and the web I understand the web's private
[1:03:57.380 --> 1:04:01.180]  but they created the system and they are now taking it over openly to shut us
[1:04:01.180 --> 1:04:04.740]  off they're openly saying they they're saying they're not just going to shut
[1:04:04.740 --> 1:04:09.460]  off US bloggers they are going to they're looking at killing us that's
[1:04:09.460 --> 1:04:13.820]  mainstream Pentagon symposiums where they sit around laughing about how they
[1:04:13.820 --> 1:04:19.900]  want to murder American citizens it's very funny to them okay you you mentioned
[1:04:19.900 --> 1:04:26.540]  you brought up another issue so let me digress to that for a moment yeah I've
[1:04:26.540 --> 1:04:31.780]  got a somewhat controversial view about that oh look here's the deal here's the

[1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:04.380]  people can't seem to understand we've got wine houses swine fluke and kill
[1:09:04.380 --> 1:09:10.820]  90,000 in US but the the caller because my pet peeve about talk radio is most
[1:09:10.820 --> 1:09:14.460]  people tune in randomly you never know what they're talking about so I know
[1:09:14.460 --> 1:09:18.540]  we were just talking about this three minutes ago but I'll recap John was
[1:09:18.540 --> 1:09:22.860]  talking about how the web is private networks the peer-to-peer the backbones
[1:09:22.860 --> 1:09:27.620]  the cogins the level 3s all these companies but the system that operates
[1:09:27.620 --> 1:09:32.180]  in the addressing system was set up by DARPA by the Defense Department and
[1:09:32.180 --> 1:09:37.660]  they've always controlled it now I can is just publicly giving control of it to
[1:09:37.660 --> 1:09:41.460]  homeland security and that's what Obama says we've got to be able to kill the
[1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:46.340]  internet to save it because al-qaeda and the Russians are attacking the web when
[1:09:46.340 --> 1:09:50.980]  in truth the military systems are on totally separate systems it's made up
[1:09:50.980 --> 1:09:55.100]  the Pentagon's been caught for 20 years attacking their own systems to blame it
[1:09:55.100 --> 1:10:00.500]  on foreign enemies false flags the name of the game and so yes September 30th and
[1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:04.980]  I've mentioned this it's very important they're going to internationalize I can
[1:10:04.980 --> 1:10:10.140]  on the surface and claim the EU and UN have a say now on the global addressing
[1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:13.700]  system they're saying they're running out of addresses which is made up so they
[1:10:13.700 --> 1:10:17.100]  can have a whole new system it's going to be internet to that they claim as
[1:10:17.100 --> 1:10:21.420]  private slash governmental slash academic they're going to then cut off the
[1:10:21.420 --> 1:10:25.580]  old web piece by piece and force you onto internet to which is just a
[1:10:25.580 --> 1:10:31.500]  glorified cable network and that's why they have a federal global wireless free
[1:10:31.500 --> 1:10:35.300]  internet it's not free you're paying for it then they can block the addresses
[1:10:35.300 --> 1:10:40.380]  they can control it just like Apple and AT&T are now blocking the tens of
[1:10:40.380 --> 1:10:46.580]  millions of Google phone users they don't let Google phones call it and now
[1:10:46.580 --> 1:10:50.580]  they're announcing Apple and AT&T are announcing they're going to block other
[1:10:50.580 --> 1:10:57.420]  internet phones Vonage type phones all these different systems so it's really
[1:10:57.420 --> 1:11:01.980]  happening and just just like just like Apple and AT&T can illegally it's a
[1:11:01.980 --> 1:11:06.100]  total violation of antitrust just like they can block people you think when
[1:11:06.100 --> 1:11:10.620]  you're buying an iPhone or you think you've got AT&T that you're being given
[1:11:10.620 --> 1:11:14.100]  service to the to the telephone world you're not that's how they're killing
[1:11:14.100 --> 1:11:18.580]  the web that's how they're killing it because if you control the addresses the
[1:11:18.580 --> 1:11:23.100]  internet you already control the web so let's you have one minute to finish
[1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:30.620]  what you were saying John about an unorthodox or controversial idea I don't
[1:11:30.620 --> 1:11:34.260]  think first off I do corrections I don't want one correct I don't have time for
[1:11:34.260 --> 1:11:38.020]  correct you gotta let you go gotta let you go I just told you you could come
[1:11:38.020 --> 1:11:43.300]  back and make your point about what it was you wanted to say I just can't do it
[1:11:43.300 --> 1:11:49.060]  all right let's talk to Mike in Tennessee Mike you're on the air go ahead Alex
[1:11:49.060 --> 1:11:55.140]  I've just passed the former NAS Millington Naval Air Station's now the Bureau of
[1:11:55.140 --> 1:12:01.420]  Personnel and other operations NSA Mid-South is referred to and it's all
[1:12:01.420 --> 1:12:06.340]  civil servants for 90% of it people to live in the area but now they've got a
[1:12:06.340 --> 1:12:11.380]  nice barbed wire fence nine-foot tall inward sloping barbed wire with razor
[1:12:11.380 --> 1:12:15.540]  wire on the top and they've got these nice pristine brand-new little cookie
[1:12:15.540 --> 1:12:19.900]  cutter houses about 1800 square feet two-story three bedroom two baths
[1:12:19.900 --> 1:12:25.900]  fenced in backyard and they're not bringing in enlisted men I think it's
[1:12:25.900 --> 1:12:32.140]  gonna be another hotel California it's my my good feeling well well start over
[1:12:32.140 --> 1:12:35.660]  that's why I got frustrated with John these are all important calls every
[1:12:35.660 --> 1:12:40.340]  call brings out important info now specifically they're announcing 400,000
[1:12:40.340 --> 1:12:46.380]  regular Army and Marines to occupy the US it was 20,000s a year ago now the Army
[1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:50.700]  Times now it's 400,000 next year will it be a million they're openly announcing
[1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:55.660]  the FEMA camps the mass graves the force inoculations specifically tell me
[1:12:55.660 --> 1:13:00.780]  where you are what this FEMA center is you're talking about well this is the
[1:13:00.780 --> 1:13:06.700]  old Millington Naval Air Station it's now NSA Mid-South it's Naval support
[1:13:06.700 --> 1:13:11.380]  activities it's the Bureau of Personnel it's where they masterminded the first
[1:13:11.380 --> 1:13:16.300]  Gulf War and launched it from here but what they've built inside of this
[1:13:16.300 --> 1:13:20.820]  facility which is 90% civil servants which are civilians which come to work
[1:13:20.820 --> 1:13:25.420]  every day which go in and do administrative work accounting stuff
[1:13:25.420 --> 1:13:30.500]  like that with they do budgets it's you're a personnel stuff well they're
[1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:33.900]  building these houses and it to me looks like a hotel California where they're
[1:13:33.900 --> 1:13:37.900]  gonna let the people come in one day and all of a sudden say well you know what we
[1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:42.220]  can't let you out you got to stay here because they've got Princeton backyards
[1:13:42.220 --> 1:13:45.740]  for dogs their two-story houses they're inside a razor wire and these are nice
[1:13:45.740 --> 1:13:50.140]  houses are cookie cutter they're quickly built well let me stop you let me stop
[1:13:50.140 --> 1:13:54.100]  you in intelligence for those that don't know not that I'm some intelligence
[1:13:54.100 --> 1:13:59.660]  expert but I've now researched how it works I organically instinctively
[1:13:59.660 --> 1:14:02.860]  already had the knowledge I didn't realize what I was doing and we can all
[1:14:02.860 --> 1:14:08.340]  do this they can make their operation secret but the manifestation of the
[1:14:08.340 --> 1:14:12.340]  operation they can make the planning secret but the manifestation of the
[1:14:12.340 --> 1:14:17.780]  operation even down to purchase orders he is going to manifest and so what you
[1:14:17.780 --> 1:14:23.820]  have observed about locking people in is actually in a lot of the different
[1:14:23.820 --> 1:14:28.820]  government documents and flu pandemic plans and martial law plans that for
[1:14:28.820 --> 1:14:33.740]  everybody's safety they're gonna lock down the bases and make the bases
[1:14:33.740 --> 1:14:41.660]  self-sufficient in a bunker mentality or a fortress redoubt mentality and yes
[1:14:41.660 --> 1:14:46.340]  that's why when they closed in the early 90s the quote bases they admitted then
[1:14:46.340 --> 1:14:50.300]  they were setting up FEMA camps on them and we have the contractors come out
[1:14:50.300 --> 1:14:53.460]  and tell us and later it was declassified and now it's confirmed in the
[1:14:53.460 --> 1:14:58.740]  civilian inmate labor camp program and so yes but you somebody ought to get some
[1:14:58.740 --> 1:15:03.340]  photos of that send it to show tips and info wars dot com let us know when
[1:15:03.340 --> 1:15:08.500]  you're gonna send it our videos and then a blurb describing it because we need
[1:15:08.500 --> 1:15:12.940]  people to see this so so you're so how many houses are they building inside the
[1:15:12.940 --> 1:15:19.780]  base you probably about 20 along the road on Navy Road and probably about 40
[1:15:19.780 --> 1:15:24.140]  deep and they're all all the I'm a general contractor and I inspect houses
[1:15:24.140 --> 1:15:30.220]  no I'm not a government inspector but I've been in the business long enough to
[1:15:30.220 --> 1:15:33.900]  realize that you don't build brand new houses in a facility where you don't
[1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:38.740]  have an elicitin and and they look like cookie cutter they're not fancy they're
[1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:44.380]  not for officers these are for warehousing people that are like
[1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:50.180]  families with pets and the list men don't have pets obviously international
[1:15:50.180 --> 1:15:55.460]  troops do not have pets these have fenced in rules a forefoot tall fenced in
[1:15:55.460 --> 1:16:02.220]  backyards this is for families so I'm looking just the way I'm thinking is
[1:16:02.220 --> 1:16:06.740]  strategically they're gonna bring in the folks that make the system run and keep
[1:16:06.740 --> 1:16:11.500]  them like a hotel California you check in but you don't check out and so they
[1:16:11.500 --> 1:16:17.100]  can combine them to the work site so that they've got a you know a captive
[1:16:17.100 --> 1:16:24.780]  workforce to make the system run you know I'm trying to place it memory wise
[1:16:24.780 --> 1:16:29.820]  but I've seen a bunch of news articles and government documents it'll come me
[1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:32.900]  during the break where they admit they're planning to lock people down on the
[1:16:32.900 --> 1:16:38.100]  basis they have the bills for the FEMA camps that just legalize the existing
[1:16:38.100 --> 1:16:41.940]  camps where it's going to be community centers where the government people are
[1:16:41.940 --> 1:16:47.220]  gonna live there that's in there the clergy response teams that again we
[1:16:47.220 --> 1:16:49.860]  broke when they were secret now it's admitted are gonna help the community
[1:16:49.860 --> 1:16:54.980]  live in the camps so they're planning on collapsing society so that everyone
[1:16:54.980 --> 1:17:01.980]  accepts the mobile federal vans as your health care everyone accepts you want to
[1:17:01.980 --> 1:17:05.980]  be in the camp and then camp industries because everybody's got to work to pay
[1:17:05.980 --> 1:17:12.300]  for this and the way they sell the camp like it's a good thing same way in
[1:17:12.300 --> 1:17:16.940]  Russia China and Nazi Germany same thing with Pol Pot same thing with
[1:17:16.940 --> 1:17:24.140]  Idi Amin in Uganda they use the same system and we see them setting it up
[1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:30.740]  and admitting it and so yes they destroy the economy so bad or release
[1:17:30.740 --> 1:17:35.100]  bio weapons or whatever it is they do that it seems reasonable that oh look
[1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:38.060]  this infrastructure is here look how they're federalizing all the cities
[1:17:38.060 --> 1:17:41.820]  right now with the threat integration centers the local FEMA centers so they're
[1:17:41.820 --> 1:17:46.660]  using flu even if it isn't deadly like they're saying as the cover for the
[1:17:46.660 --> 1:17:52.500]  federalization you understand exactly and one other thing real quick for the
[1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:56.980]  last couple of weeks I've been doing remotes supporting local radio station
[1:17:56.980 --> 1:18:01.660]  that carries your show and passing out your flyers I think you sent them about
[1:18:01.660 --> 1:18:06.700]  2000 promos that list all the articles that you sell on your website and I've
[1:18:06.700 --> 1:18:11.540]  been keeping a track of the cross section of the people that come up thumbs up
[1:18:11.540 --> 1:18:15.580]  that are positive and know what's going on you're gonna be amazed at the young
[1:18:15.580 --> 1:18:20.980]  kids and the old adults especially the former military especially hiring
[1:18:20.980 --> 1:18:26.260]  listed in officers they know what's going on but these school teachers I had
[1:18:26.260 --> 1:18:29.940]  one girl come by whose father was there as a teacher and she was proud that she
[1:18:29.940 --> 1:18:34.660]  just had her Gardasil shot I kid you not and I asked her were she aware of what's
[1:18:34.660 --> 1:18:39.460]  in the new H1N1 flu virus and she said yes she can't wait she's you know got
[1:18:39.460 --> 1:18:43.540]  to be the first to get it as soon as it comes out they're gonna do their best to
[1:18:43.540 --> 1:18:47.940]  make sure that they don't get the H1N1 by taking the virus and you know we're
[1:18:47.940 --> 1:18:51.460]  talking about a 16-year-old girl who's a senior in high school I I didn't want to
[1:18:51.460 --> 1:18:54.420]  frighten her I said well you've got internet access why don't you look for
[1:18:54.420 --> 1:18:58.500]  these certain terms and I talked about squalene and by Mary's in I said take a
[1:18:58.500 --> 1:19:02.660]  look at what's in the shot and then go get a copy of the manufacturers print out
[1:19:02.660 --> 1:19:07.020]  for the Gardasil and just read it and you know just read and then Google search

[1:23:57.780 --> 1:24:19.780]  is owned by Big John Lipscombe
[1:24:19.780 --> 1:24:24.980]  I meant to ask the last caller Mike Genesee what station he's listening to
[1:24:24.980 --> 1:24:30.380]  is he listening to Nashville is he listening to Knoxville
[1:24:30.380 --> 1:24:37.620]  Perry Groth John WBCR I think we've got a three affiliates now in Tennessee
[1:24:37.620 --> 1:24:42.780]  AMs and very very thankful to all of those affiliates and look I would try to
[1:24:42.780 --> 1:24:46.100]  be mean to John earlier I had John for five minutes John and I said come back
[1:24:46.100 --> 1:24:49.060]  make your point and I had to be corrected I don't have time for that I
[1:24:49.060 --> 1:24:52.180]  got other calls I got to go to but I'm not trying to be mean here if you
[1:24:52.180 --> 1:24:56.380]  actually listen to the show we give callers more time than other people but
[1:24:56.380 --> 1:25:00.820]  it's not one of these boring shows where the guest talks for an hour and the
[1:25:00.820 --> 1:25:06.540]  host says mm-hmm or where they just take call after call after call and the
[1:25:06.540 --> 1:25:10.340]  host doesn't say anything I come in with points I come in with topics I come in
[1:25:10.340 --> 1:25:13.420]  with information that's why we're the number one alternative show you watch
[1:25:13.420 --> 1:25:17.740]  Fox or CNN with their guests they're interrupting every seven eight seconds on
[1:25:17.740 --> 1:25:21.740]  average not here I've timed it we interrupt on average every 45 seconds so
[1:25:21.740 --> 1:25:25.140]  that's why it's a dynamic it's thought-provoking so I gave you five
[1:25:25.140 --> 1:25:28.220]  minutes and it's just you just it wasn't enough for you and then you just had to
[1:25:28.220 --> 1:25:31.700]  correct me and I just don't have time for it because the next caller is going
[1:25:31.700 --> 1:25:35.860]  to have some incredible news Mark in Wisconsin Mark you're on the air go
[1:25:35.860 --> 1:25:40.740]  ahead Alex I great to speak with you and I do have incredible news we got some
[1:25:40.740 --> 1:25:45.980]  Glenn Beck news and we have some swine flu news I'm reading online here a piece
[1:25:45.980 --> 1:25:50.740]  referring to Beck that says he was on the Fox and Friends morning show he
[1:25:50.740 --> 1:25:54.780]  accused Obama of having a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white
[1:25:54.780 --> 1:26:01.780]  excuse me culture that goes back to the racism thing that it's always about as
[1:26:01.780 --> 1:26:07.340]  highly mentioned on your show accurately and by the way that that presents his
[1:26:07.340 --> 1:26:12.460]  accusations in all reality it's it's almost reverse psychology because the
[1:26:12.460 --> 1:26:17.620]  way he presents his accusations makes him appear as a racist which makes everyone
[1:26:17.620 --> 1:26:24.340]  who questions and criticizes Obama appear as a racist look I'm gonna let you
[1:26:24.340 --> 1:26:30.460]  finish your point but it's easy to throw two pit bulls in a pit together it's
[1:26:30.460 --> 1:26:35.020]  easy to throw two roosters in together it's easy to throw two men in together
[1:26:35.020 --> 1:26:39.540]  you know Brock Lezner and somebody else to beat each other to death it's easy to
[1:26:39.540 --> 1:26:44.740]  do evil and so exactly Beck comes out and says something true about black
[1:26:44.740 --> 1:26:49.900]  liberation Reverend Jeremiah Wright about a deep-seated hatred of whites and
[1:26:49.900 --> 1:26:56.060]  it's true but it then ignites the debate more and then meanwhile black
[1:26:56.060 --> 1:27:00.100]  nationalist van jones comes out and then says he's racist for telling the truth
[1:27:00.100 --> 1:27:04.780]  and then it ignites the whole debate which is what Obama was meant to do to
[1:27:04.780 --> 1:27:09.060]  get everybody at each other's throats go ahead exactly controlled opposition
[1:27:09.060 --> 1:27:13.220]  playing one against the other and in all reality the entire country gets screwed
[1:27:13.220 --> 1:27:18.860]  and setting the precedent through Beck who's unpopular and polarizing popular
[1:27:18.860 --> 1:27:22.540]  with some and overall polarizing meant to look stupid and leader hosen and all
[1:27:22.540 --> 1:27:27.180]  the rest of it using him as the poster child to chill and restrict free speech
[1:27:27.180 --> 1:27:31.780]  across the board that's why you've got to support Beck we can't play into their
[1:27:31.780 --> 1:27:36.180]  trap right on this issue I completely agree you hit it right on the head Alex
[1:27:36.180 --> 1:27:40.700]  and getting to the swine flu stuff there's one article is a quote from
[1:27:40.700 --> 1:27:45.300]  Kathleen Sebelius that says so far trials look good we won't be administering
[1:27:45.300 --> 1:27:50.540]  any vaccine that isn't proven to be effective and safe this strain of flu
[1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:54.620]  is so unusual deaths are more likely to occur among children and young adults
[1:27:54.620 --> 1:27:59.140]  usually the healthiest group I find that to be real curious I'll tell you why
[1:27:59.140 --> 1:28:03.260]  go ahead no I was gonna say I find that to be curious because those are the
[1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:06.740]  people who they're going to be shoving the vaccine down their throats the most
[1:28:06.740 --> 1:28:14.780]  the children in school exactly I appreciate your great great points
[1:28:14.780 --> 1:28:20.420]  let me let me comment on that point before we end the segment that's because
[1:28:20.420 --> 1:28:28.700]  this flu reportedly has a hemorrhagic reaction your body gets hit by it and
[1:28:28.700 --> 1:28:35.860]  you have an autoimmune response that causes your lungs within a matter of
[1:28:35.860 --> 1:28:41.100]  hours to fill with liquid and you stop breathing that's what the 1918 did
[1:28:41.100 --> 1:28:46.220]  clearly a bio weapon and the 1976 clearly a bio weapon they have a
[1:28:46.220 --> 1:28:51.220]  inoculation at a military base in both cases people start dying they then use
[1:28:51.220 --> 1:28:56.220]  that to fear monger and that's how this program works and then the shot in
[1:28:56.220 --> 1:29:00.180]  76 kills the people but look what does mercury and the other adjuvant
[1:29:00.180 --> 1:29:04.260]  squailing do according to medical doctors brain surgeons epidemiologists
[1:29:04.260 --> 1:29:08.820]  neurologists and chemists and bio engineers we've had them all on another
[1:29:08.820 --> 1:29:13.780]  doctor coming up medical doctor next hour the mercury and the squailing and
[1:29:13.780 --> 1:29:17.900]  other adjuvants that accelerate an autoimmune response that's what brings
[1:29:17.900 --> 1:29:25.620]  on the hemorrhagic fever it's kind of like I put a 45 rounds in a gun I close
[1:29:25.620 --> 1:29:37.060]  it and I pull the trigger the cap is the supposed virus the attenuated virus but
[1:29:37.060 --> 1:29:43.220]  it mixed with the other adjuvants causes a autoimmune storm that then causes your
[1:29:43.220 --> 1:29:47.380]  brain to swell and brain damage or death amongst other things like your lungs
[1:29:47.380 --> 1:29:52.100]  filling up with stuff so yes that's how the vaccine kills you we're on the march
[1:29:52.100 --> 1:30:01.460]  the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones
[1:30:01.460 --> 1:30:05.100]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:30:05.100 --> 1:30:08.660]  this summer number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[1:30:08.660 --> 1:30:12.820]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[1:30:12.820 --> 1:30:17.060]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:30:17.060 --> 1:30:21.020]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[1:30:21.020 --> 1:30:24.940]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:30:24.940 --> 1:30:28.580]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[1:30:28.580 --> 1:30:31.900]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[1:30:31.900 --> 1:30:35.820]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar
[1:30:35.820 --> 1:30:39.660]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[1:30:39.660 --> 1:30:42.780]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[1:33:58.220 --> 1:34:04.260]  around release time but I wanted to get Cindy Sheehan on we appreciate her
[1:34:04.260 --> 1:34:10.020]  popping in to give us a report on what's happening Martha's Vineyard one of the
[1:34:10.020 --> 1:34:13.300]  favorite hangouts of the Clintons and Walter Cronkite and kind of the
[1:34:13.300 --> 1:34:20.180]  eastern establishment of the eugenesis clan and Cindy Sheehan who lost her son
[1:34:20.180 --> 1:34:25.980]  of course in Iraq became a national icon standing up to Bush at the Crawford
[1:34:25.980 --> 1:34:30.140]  Ranch now Obama's in the news saying please give my family privacy oh but
[1:34:30.140 --> 1:34:34.820]  his spy satellites and NSA phone tapping and his blackwater thugs they're not
[1:34:34.820 --> 1:34:39.420]  giving us any rest and so there's hardly any mainstream media at least I
[1:34:39.420 --> 1:34:43.500]  searched it this morning I saw some about Cindy Sheehan with all these other
[1:34:43.500 --> 1:34:48.380]  great peace activists because again it was trending and fun to protest Bush
[1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:52.500]  knowing he wouldn't in the war for the establishment but now that they're in
[1:34:52.500 --> 1:34:57.220]  power like Rahm Emanuel said you know he campaigned against Democrats and ran
[1:34:57.220 --> 1:35:00.620]  the Democratic Party operation against Democrats that were actually against
[1:35:00.620 --> 1:35:04.940]  war and the corporate guys tried to throw Dennis Kasinich out because he's
[1:35:04.940 --> 1:35:08.860]  actually a real liberal and against war and a real progressive so Cindy Sheehan
[1:35:08.860 --> 1:35:12.860]  is out there shattering a left-right paradigm we've been publishing an
[1:35:12.860 --> 1:35:16.500]  info wars.com and prisonpunna.com the articles and reports he's been
[1:35:16.500 --> 1:35:21.740]  putting out they've got YouTube videos up get her information out viral and ask
[1:35:21.740 --> 1:35:26.060]  the media why aren't you covering this more troops are dying under Obama than
[1:35:26.060 --> 1:35:30.660]  under Bush he's expanding the wars all his top generals say 10 to 15 years
[1:35:30.660 --> 1:35:35.180]  before they leave they rewrote the maps of the US bases so they weren't part of
[1:35:35.180 --> 1:35:41.220]  the cities to claim they left the cities corporate lawyer semantical games
[1:35:41.220 --> 1:35:46.700]  Cindy Sheehan from Martha's Vineyard site of Lord Obama vacationing Cindy good
[1:35:46.700 --> 1:35:51.940]  to have you here with us. Hi Alex thank you so much for helping to promote this
[1:35:51.940 --> 1:35:57.580]  protest and promote the fact that like you said even though there's a change in
[1:35:57.580 --> 1:36:02.380]  regime there's only change in policy has been for the worst and and we just
[1:36:02.380 --> 1:36:09.900]  really do reclaim our integrity and our morality in the anti-war movement to to
[1:36:09.900 --> 1:36:14.860]  say that the wars we were right to see the wrong under Bush and we're still
[1:36:14.860 --> 1:36:19.300]  right to say they're still wrong under Obama and to me it's a lack of media
[1:36:19.300 --> 1:36:26.900]  coverage but it's also a lack of any kind of cooperation or solidarity that I'm
[1:36:26.900 --> 1:36:33.180]  not received from the establishment anti-war movement. Well that's because the Ford
[1:36:33.180 --> 1:36:36.740]  Foundation that's because the Ford Foundation as you know and these other
[1:36:36.740 --> 1:36:41.980]  big money groups run and control the fake left it's just I mean where is Amy
[1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:47.060]  Goodman where are all these groups continue please Cindy Sheehan tell us
[1:36:47.060 --> 1:36:50.700]  what's happening out there how many people are out there where you're
[1:36:50.700 --> 1:36:54.420]  located so other people could come join you how long you're going to be there
[1:36:54.420 --> 1:37:01.420]  what the Secret Service is doing. All I can say for the moment is that to get a
[1:37:01.420 --> 1:37:07.100]  list of events they can go to my blog or to your website and it's that Cindy
[1:37:07.100 --> 1:37:12.060]  Sheehan so boxblogspot.com the first event that we're going to have is
[1:37:12.060 --> 1:37:17.740]  organized will be a corporate media conference tomorrow at 11 so we'll see
[1:37:17.740 --> 1:37:25.340]  how much coverage we get protesting Obama but another thing is that we're
[1:37:25.340 --> 1:37:32.620]  going to be writing people all over the world an international people's
[1:37:32.620 --> 1:37:38.940]  declaration of peace and that's to start a grassroots movement because as I
[1:37:38.940 --> 1:37:43.700]  said so many times the robber class doesn't want to change you know we can't
[1:37:43.700 --> 1:37:47.900]  force a robber class to change especially if so many of our so-called
[1:37:47.900 --> 1:37:53.660]  opposition has been co-opted by the by the two-party system or whatever whatever
[1:37:53.660 --> 1:37:56.860]  you want to call it so we're going to be writing that we hope that we'll get
[1:37:56.860 --> 1:38:02.380]  solidarity from you and from your listeners on this people's declaration
[1:38:02.380 --> 1:38:06.500]  of peace that we'll be writing. I'm staying just right around the corner from
[1:38:06.500 --> 1:38:14.020]  Obama so I'm hoping to bump into him if he ventures out of his compound. Now again
[1:38:14.020 --> 1:38:17.620]  for people geographically tell folks where Martha's Vineyard is where the
[1:38:17.620 --> 1:38:22.700]  press conference is a lot of people aren't online or I mean how do people
[1:38:22.700 --> 1:38:26.420]  come out to this do we call the media challenge them to be there what do we
[1:38:26.420 --> 1:38:31.420]  do? Well absolutely you know the media is already there because Obama's there so
[1:38:31.420 --> 1:38:37.500]  what we have to do is you can call the media station at Oak Bluff Elementary
[1:38:37.500 --> 1:38:41.380]  School that's where the press conference is going to be tomorrow at 11. We're
[1:38:41.380 --> 1:38:49.700]  having a large anti-war rally on Saturday if people who are in Massachusetts or
[1:38:49.700 --> 1:38:56.940]  around this area can get to Martha's Vineyard we will have a large vigil
[1:38:56.940 --> 1:39:01.580]  rally teach-in against the war. The island is fairly small and we're going to
[1:39:01.580 --> 1:39:06.540]  blink at the island we have support from people on Martha's Vineyard who have
[1:39:06.540 --> 1:39:11.620]  offered us housing offered us places to hang our banners places to put signs
[1:39:11.620 --> 1:39:16.100]  places to do our vigil so we're going to be all over that island because we don't
[1:39:16.100 --> 1:39:21.740]  want Obama or the press or the anti-war movement to not know that we're there
[1:39:21.740 --> 1:39:28.140]  still protesting the war like we were when Bush was president. What response are
[1:39:28.140 --> 1:39:30.860]  you starting to get I mean I do see you getting more attention than you were a
[1:39:30.860 --> 1:39:34.940]  few months ago what are some of the positive responses you're getting from
[1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:40.140]  the anti-war community or just the sanity community and what responses are
[1:39:40.140 --> 1:39:46.380]  you getting that are negative well it's interesting that the negative responses
[1:39:46.380 --> 1:39:51.980]  I'm getting are from people who I think call themselves anti-war progressives
[1:39:51.980 --> 1:39:57.380]  saying that I should give Obama a rest that I shouldn't let him have a peaceful
[1:39:57.380 --> 1:40:02.380]  vacation well I like you know four of our troops were killed yesterday in
[1:40:02.380 --> 1:40:06.700]  Afghanistan I don't know even know how many Afghans or Pakistanis were killed
[1:40:06.700 --> 1:40:13.960]  yesterday and they're getting a long rest now yeah so exactly exactly so why
[1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:18.900]  does he deserve a peaceful vacation the world deserves a vacation from war and
[1:40:18.900 --> 1:40:22.740]  a vacation from body bags it doesn't stop no matter what the president and by
[1:40:22.740 --> 1:40:26.180]  the way Cindy we know what this war is about I mean I saw Admiral Mullen on
[1:40:26.180 --> 1:40:31.300]  CNN two nights ago making up stuff about why the opium has gone over 12 times
[1:40:31.300 --> 1:40:35.820]  what it was I mean since the liberation and then BBC admits oh we guard the
[1:40:35.820 --> 1:40:40.060]  opium so the warlords don't get it and then suddenly heroin is all over the
[1:40:40.060 --> 1:40:45.020]  streets they're there just like the Russians were there to get that smack
[1:40:45.020 --> 1:40:52.820]  right well and then also there's a there's the whole pipeline thing to get to
[1:40:52.820 --> 1:40:58.740]  get the oil to Asia from from the Middle East of course it's for profit of
[1:40:58.740 --> 1:41:03.180]  course that's right black and black gold black tar heroin and black gold
[1:41:03.180 --> 1:41:09.540]  that's what they're always for so yep yep so that's what we're doing is we're
[1:41:09.540 --> 1:41:13.740]  getting a lot of excitement where we're getting I'm getting mostly support which
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:18.260]  is a very gratifying to me and thank you for your support and letting your
[1:41:18.260 --> 1:41:22.100]  listeners and your your viewers know what we're doing that's really important

[1:41:57.340 --> 1:42:04.300]  all over that island every day well Cindy this is very exciting and I'd like to
[1:42:04.300 --> 1:42:08.340]  get some updates from you again throughout the week here and maybe on
[1:42:08.340 --> 1:42:12.020]  Sunday on the Sunday show when it's all over kind of a recapping final event
[1:42:12.020 --> 1:42:15.380]  for people out there driving along in their cars or listening on shortwave or
[1:42:15.380 --> 1:42:22.980]  whatever or on satellite slowly give out the website address again okay Cindy
[1:42:22.980 --> 1:42:35.340]  see hands soapbox.blogspot.com there's a schedule of time date some places where
[1:42:35.340 --> 1:42:39.660]  we will be for sure that we know already there's a place where people can
[1:42:39.660 --> 1:42:46.700]  donate to help us with expenses and just a place where you can see the the
[1:42:46.700 --> 1:42:51.420]  ideology or the philosophy of why we're out there so let me ask you a question
[1:42:51.420 --> 1:42:58.020]  of in closing are you getting any media coming to you before they were mobbing
[1:42:58.020 --> 1:43:02.740]  you you were having to hide in a trailer giving interviews 15 hours a day now
[1:43:02.740 --> 1:43:10.780]  what's happening there seems to be some interest I talked to some corporate
[1:43:10.780 --> 1:43:16.420]  media newspapers today so it's not like it was when I was in Crawford that for
[1:43:16.420 --> 1:43:20.980]  sure so I find that very interesting well I mean number one it's a great story
[1:43:20.980 --> 1:43:25.780]  Cindy Sheehan now back you know this has been going on for seven years here
[1:43:25.780 --> 1:43:30.100]  Cindy Sheehan you know five years into this now she's back it's still happening
[1:43:30.100 --> 1:43:35.940]  under Obama that's a big story I've been trying to be low key until our
[1:43:35.940 --> 1:43:40.900]  press event tomorrow so after the press event tomorrow we'll see what happens
[1:43:40.900 --> 1:43:44.860]  okay we'll check in with you again Cindy Sheehan thank you okay great Alex
[1:43:44.860 --> 1:43:49.820]  thank you thank you so much and again we'll definitely at least check in with
[1:43:49.820 --> 1:43:54.180]  her Sunday in the aftermath of all of this the media should be knocking her
[1:43:54.180 --> 1:44:00.580]  door down but but but no it's so trendy and fun to have Obama's trying to start
[1:44:00.580 --> 1:44:05.340]  wars with the Russians and putting more troops into Afghanistan and wanting to go
[1:44:05.340 --> 1:44:09.540]  into Pakistan and predator drones and a hundred thousand plus troops still in
[1:44:09.540 --> 1:44:14.740]  Iraq and never leaving I mean it's an insult to my intelligence it's an insult
[1:44:14.740 --> 1:44:22.860]  to your intelligence to have the media and the Iraqi government under orders of
[1:44:22.860 --> 1:44:27.300]  the globalist redraw their city maps where the green zone and other bases
[1:44:27.300 --> 1:44:34.460]  aren't part of the cities now and then say our troops have pulled out I mean
[1:44:34.460 --> 1:44:40.700]  this is a very cynical cynical joke and they did pull back in one respect they
[1:44:40.700 --> 1:44:46.300]  pulled out that the two-year-old surge took troops out of the fortresses and
[1:44:46.300 --> 1:44:49.820]  put them in machine gun nests and checkpoints kind of like community
[1:44:49.820 --> 1:44:59.540]  policing and now they've pulled those out so it's amazing it's kind of like
[1:44:59.540 --> 1:45:02.300]  cutting somebody's leg off and saying open I'm trying to fix it and giving
[1:45:02.300 --> 1:45:07.940]  them a bandaid I mean it's too little too late it's a joke it's cosmetic it's a
[1:45:07.940 --> 1:45:12.140]  corporate front I want to keep going to your phone calls for Dr. Eisenstein
[1:45:12.140 --> 1:45:18.100]  joins us I also want to get into Bernanke being nominated for another term as
[1:45:18.100 --> 1:45:22.220]  private fellow reserve chairman the rest of the boards appointed by them but he's
[1:45:22.220 --> 1:45:25.140]  the little front man Geithner's the former head of the New York Fed that's
[1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:31.900]  the real powerhouse in the corporate structure that's coming up also judge
[1:45:31.900 --> 1:45:35.820]  orders fed to disclose who received bailout trillions Paul Joseph Watson
[1:45:35.820 --> 1:45:40.700]  key story up on prisonplanet.com big news judge orders fed to disclose who
[1:45:40.700 --> 1:45:45.140]  received bailout trillions I said billions you're the mind has trouble
[1:45:45.140 --> 1:45:48.980]  dealing with trillions you used to have trouble a decade ago with billions now
[1:45:48.980 --> 1:45:52.500]  it's trillions soon it'll be quadrillions well it already is in the
[1:45:52.500 --> 1:45:59.460]  quadrillions the total black hole of debt that we're dealing with with the
[1:45:59.460 --> 1:46:03.220]  derivatives I wanted to tell folks that up on
[1:46:03.220 --> 1:46:09.660]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com we have the first detailed write-up of my new
[1:46:09.660 --> 1:46:17.260]  film that is nearing completion that is we've got two hours laid out and I'm
[1:46:17.260 --> 1:46:22.020]  trying to put this in take that out add this document add that clip working on
[1:46:22.020 --> 1:46:26.060]  a few final voiceovers and I'll polish it in the next three four weeks and we're
[1:46:26.060 --> 1:46:33.380]  going to be mass manufactured pre-order start September 21st and they ship out
[1:46:33.380 --> 1:46:37.180]  a few days before the official release date at prisonplanet.tv will release
[1:46:37.180 --> 1:46:40.980]  there in the highest quality it ships out on DVD a few days before that so you
[1:46:40.980 --> 1:46:45.020]  should be getting it in or around the release time we're trying to even make
[1:46:45.020 --> 1:46:49.460]  the DVD earlier and then hold it so we can ship it out even faster but the
[1:46:49.460 --> 1:46:53.900]  pre-orders will start coming up in about three four weeks and it's about three
[1:46:53.900 --> 1:47:02.580]  and a half weeks and I wanted to go ahead and play the trailer to the new film so
[1:47:02.580 --> 1:47:10.980]  here is trailer one for fall of the Republic and I want to say great job to
[1:47:10.980 --> 1:47:14.940]  the music guys here we've used Graham Reynolds in the past and I've also bought
[1:47:14.940 --> 1:47:18.780]  royalty-free music in the past and Rob Jacobson's made music in the past this
[1:47:18.780 --> 1:47:22.700]  time we've been using Derek Einkopf and Will and a few others who are in the
[1:47:22.700 --> 1:47:26.380]  office in a fabulous job this is a quick mix this is kind of a raw trailer
[1:47:26.380 --> 1:47:30.020]  because I realized I've been so focused on the film that I wasn't we've been
[1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:33.380]  focused on trailers to promote it but so we've got even more powerful trailers
[1:47:33.380 --> 1:47:36.940]  coming out in the next few weeks but this is a great trailer Rob Jacobson put
[1:47:36.940 --> 1:47:42.940]  together and it says the following film preview is rated vital to the Republic
[1:47:42.940 --> 1:47:48.220]  and necessary for all audiences in defense of liberty it's rated V for viral
[1:47:48.220 --> 1:47:51.540]  transmission in the info war spread this film everywhere through viral
[1:47:51.540 --> 1:47:55.500]  transmission to keep and preserve the Constitution and defeat tyranny in all
[1:47:55.500 --> 1:48:00.420]  its forms here it is fall of the Republic
[1:48:14.140 --> 1:48:19.300]  last week the head of the country's central bank loaded the idea of dumping
[1:48:19.300 --> 1:48:23.700]  the green back as the world's reserve currency replacing it with an
[1:48:23.700 --> 1:48:28.300]  international currency thousands of people gathered to hear Barack Obama
[1:48:28.300 --> 1:48:33.540]  deliver key foreign policy speech on his current European tour his vision for
[1:48:33.540 --> 1:48:39.140]  America's place in a new world order returning vets could be a risk to our
[1:48:39.140 --> 1:48:45.580]  nation we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I
[1:48:45.580 --> 1:48:49.140]  think all of us would like to see and one of the ways it will drive the change
[1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:54.460]  is through global governance I think the new world order is emerging this is a
[1:48:54.460 --> 1:48:59.780]  hoax and a scam which is designed to transfer wealth and power from the
[1:48:59.780 --> 1:49:03.180]  private sector to the government sector and from the government of the United
[1:49:03.180 --> 1:49:08.180]  States to a world government and those people who have been yelling oh the UN
[1:49:08.180 --> 1:49:12.380]  is gonna take over global mercy they consider they've been crazy but now
[1:49:12.380 --> 1:49:17.180]  they're right and who got the money hundreds and hundreds of banks any bank
[1:49:17.180 --> 1:49:23.300]  or that has access to the U.S. Federal Reserve system tell us who they are no
[1:49:23.300 --> 1:49:26.660]  you know financial terrorism they have the ability to tweak the knob I am
[1:49:26.660 --> 1:49:31.620]  proposing that the Federal Reserve be granted new authority the ultimate goal
[1:49:31.620 --> 1:49:37.740]  of the carbon tax and the cap and trade is to destroy production this energy
[1:49:37.740 --> 1:49:42.980]  taxes the largest tax increase in American history we're actually creating a
[1:49:42.980 --> 1:49:46.380]  global warming police so number one they can come in the federal government can
[1:49:46.380 --> 1:49:51.340]  come in and spec your house and send you the bill we're setting up a global warming
[1:49:51.340 --> 1:49:57.180]  Gestapo one of the things that if you talk to our guys they are desperate for
[1:49:57.180 --> 1:50:09.860]  is a civilian counterpart to our military forces I am fierce is what I
[1:50:09.860 --> 1:50:14.100]  wear Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law
[1:50:14.100 --> 1:50:19.100]  enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad I've
[1:50:19.100 --> 1:50:25.180]  now been in 57 states I think one left to go the president when he was in
[1:50:25.180 --> 1:50:30.340]  Europe last week he met with the king of Saudi Arabia he appeared to Bob president
[1:50:30.340 --> 1:50:35.220]  Obama today proposed something new something called prolonged detention
[1:50:35.220 --> 1:50:39.460]  pre-crime is where people are arrested and incarcerated to prevent crimes that
[1:50:39.460 --> 1:50:58.020]  they have not yet full of the Republic coming to the info war October 21st 2009

[2:00:29.820 --> 2:00:36.140]  Barack Obama depicted as zombie killer in the comic book is that racist is that
[2:00:36.140 --> 2:00:41.620]  wrong should we all be arrested by the thought police says they've portrayed the
[2:00:41.620 --> 2:00:48.060]  president as a new comic book series named as he plays on words with the
[2:00:48.060 --> 2:00:54.820]  popular horror franchise Resident Evil and it's Obama with chainsaws as a
[2:00:54.820 --> 2:00:59.940]  superhero killing zombies yeah it was okay to show him a Superman to show him
[2:00:59.940 --> 2:01:04.380]  as Batman but you don't show him as the Joker why I need to be arrested for
[2:01:04.380 --> 2:01:07.660]  doing that and anybody else does too you don't talk bad about the president
[2:01:07.660 --> 2:01:10.700]  that's illegal because we don't have free speech in America everybody knows
[2:01:10.700 --> 2:01:15.700]  that well I got news for you we're gonna talk about whatever we want here let's
[2:01:15.700 --> 2:01:19.780]  go to Jeff in Oregon and Donna in Texas Bill Jean Pat and others Jeff you're on
[2:01:19.780 --> 2:01:25.460]  the air welcome oh yes good morning Alex just a question here I happen to be
[2:01:25.460 --> 2:01:33.700]  listening to doctor doctor ten penny on with Nory I think it was last week and
[2:01:33.700 --> 2:01:40.380]  I'm just wondering she hinted to that she's thinking it will not be a forced
[2:01:40.380 --> 2:01:46.500]  inoculation but rather a de facto criminalization of refusing the
[2:01:46.500 --> 2:01:50.860]  inoculate yeah no no no yeah you won't fly you'll have to stay in your house
[2:01:50.860 --> 2:01:54.900]  they'll arrest you they won't let you go to work and then in the future you have
[2:01:54.900 --> 2:01:58.460]  to take all their other vaccines or you can't go to work that's exactly how
[2:01:58.460 --> 2:02:01.740]  they're planning to do it in fact let's set ten penny back up for the show
[2:02:01.740 --> 2:02:06.500]  as she's learned a lot more now about this current flu situation she's been
[2:02:06.500 --> 2:02:10.380]  picking up a lot of new data and let's also set up Horowitz Horowitz and ten
[2:02:10.380 --> 2:02:16.060]  penny but go ahead sir so you know the thing that disturbs me about this is
[2:02:16.060 --> 2:02:22.020]  when she said that of course last night I was listening to the replay it when
[2:02:22.020 --> 2:02:27.420]  you interviewed I think it was the last time you interviewed I can't he seems
[2:02:27.420 --> 2:02:32.700]  to and other people who talk about the new world order seem to come back to
[2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:38.140]  our best defense is to peacefully resist the problem is and it seems that
[2:02:38.140 --> 2:02:43.420]  nobody wants to talk about this not that for Stan not like not anyone they're
[2:02:43.420 --> 2:02:48.840]  not going to let you peacefully resist I understand that that's why we don't
[2:02:48.840 --> 2:02:54.060]  offensively go out because then they can cast us as the bad guy when we defend
[2:02:54.060 --> 2:02:57.860]  ourselves there's no way for him to demonize it but we try to reach out to
[2:02:57.860 --> 2:03:02.140]  military and police you've got police the military the nurses associations in
[2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:08.780]  Europe and the US the majority of them two weeks ago it was 35% of nurses say
[2:03:08.780 --> 2:03:14.700]  no this week it was last night I saw over 60% in New York State look they're
[2:03:14.700 --> 2:03:17.580]  not going to get away with it but they're going to come back over and over
[2:03:17.580 --> 2:03:22.500]  again with wanting to put things in our bodies because that's what the eugenicist
[2:03:22.500 --> 2:03:26.540]  are into that's their zero population growth that's what the government
[2:03:26.540 --> 2:03:31.020]  textbooks call for that's what they want so they want to set that precedent
[2:03:31.020 --> 2:03:34.340]  that's why they love pharmacological crops they're already engineering the
[2:03:34.340 --> 2:03:38.260]  crops to do this yeah there's a poll half of doctors will refuse to take swine
[2:03:38.260 --> 2:03:43.700]  flu shot Steve Watson that came out
[2:03:43.700 --> 2:03:52.820]  I came out today so very very interesting anything else sir yeah did you say
[2:03:52.820 --> 2:03:59.140]  that Israel 75% of the doctors were against the vaccine but they're going
[2:03:59.140 --> 2:04:04.740]  to vaccinate the entire population anyway I don't remember saying that I
[2:04:04.740 --> 2:04:09.300]  must have heard that from somebody else so Alex you are the Sean Connery
[2:04:09.300 --> 2:04:15.220]  character in Outland well that's Outland what am I like going around with a
[2:04:15.220 --> 2:04:22.020]  shotgun fighting with for the company hitmen that are trying to sell some

[2:04:27.460 --> 2:04:33.420]  it it's a good science fiction movie it's really like a western set on some moon
[2:04:33.420 --> 2:04:40.020]  of Saturn I think I run a mining operation it's a good movie Sean Connery
[2:04:40.020 --> 2:04:48.660]  should have done more serious roles like that said it's like Highlander oh my god

[2:09:57.820 --> 2:10:01.340]  repeat the point you made when I was first talking to you. Let me tell you
[2:10:01.340 --> 2:10:06.940]  Alex it is a true report a comment you know as I've been following this you
[2:10:06.940 --> 2:10:11.540]  know I've been blessed I'm a student of the late Dr. Mendelsohn so I knew that
[2:10:11.540 --> 2:10:15.700]  vaccines are dangerous because he knew about that 35 years ago and so most of
[2:10:15.700 --> 2:10:19.540]  my practice and none of my children have been vaccinated but when you were
[2:10:19.540 --> 2:10:23.740]  talking about eugenics population control that they have different stuff in
[2:10:23.740 --> 2:10:30.420]  the vaccines your material's gotten soft Alex I mean this is mainstream media
[2:10:30.420 --> 2:10:34.540]  that they're picking up on this you know I mean I wanted to know something
[2:10:34.540 --> 2:10:40.900]  I looked at Fox News yesterday online and they talked about that the latest
[2:10:40.900 --> 2:10:46.380]  our Dr. John Holdren who's a nasty nasty person I mean and we're gonna
[2:10:46.380 --> 2:10:50.220]  talk about him for a minute you know he wants to push this vaccine in September
[2:10:50.220 --> 2:10:56.380]  you know but and he's the one who co-authored a book with Dr. Paul
[2:10:56.380 --> 2:11:01.420]  Ehrlich in the 70s about eugenics and everything I mean he you know they
[2:11:01.420 --> 2:11:06.900]  openly said it you know and he's the one who wants to put this push this but so
[2:11:06.900 --> 2:11:09.820]  they talked about how 90,000 people are gonna die
[2:11:09.820 --> 2:11:14.980]  hundred people commented 95% have been listening to Alex Jones or I thought
[2:11:14.980 --> 2:11:18.740]  they were that there's mercury you shouldn't take the vaccine just quailing
[2:11:18.740 --> 2:11:21.700]  you shouldn't take the vaccine Dr. Tenpenny said you shouldn't take the
[2:11:21.700 --> 2:11:27.300]  vaccine I thought I was looking at a alternative medicine blog unbelievable
[2:11:27.300 --> 2:11:31.660]  you're soft Alex you got to get a better material you got to make up some
[2:11:31.660 --> 2:11:35.700]  stuff the New World Order that it's all real that's also it's frightening it's
[2:11:35.700 --> 2:11:40.820]  well here's the issue and you're right actually a lot of conspiracy theorists do
[2:11:40.820 --> 2:11:45.420]  start getting into the Earth is hollow and has space aliens in it and Alex
[2:11:45.420 --> 2:11:51.020]  Jones is a reptoid because all the mainline stuff has been admitted now so
[2:11:51.020 --> 2:11:54.980]  it doesn't have that shock value but no I just go off the government documents I
[2:11:54.980 --> 2:11:59.860]  go off of what I'm aware of that's why now it's all mainstream news because
[2:11:59.860 --> 2:12:04.020]  they're carrying their program out but because we planted all those seeds and
[2:12:04.020 --> 2:12:08.540]  you and others valiantly did as well now we're having a big effect and you're
[2:12:08.540 --> 2:12:14.420]  right I see articles about the government health care the vaccines message
[2:12:14.420 --> 2:12:21.980]  boards on mainline newspapers in Europe in Texas England and you're right 9 out
[2:12:21.980 --> 2:12:27.380]  of 10 or more when you said 95% that's more like it and people can go see this
[2:12:27.380 --> 2:12:33.260]  for themselves they're all awake they know and I think the eugenesis just like
[2:12:33.260 --> 2:12:39.460]  with Hitler you know if Hitler was a popular guy in 1936 3738 time magazine
[2:12:39.460 --> 2:12:44.860]  you know great guy eugenics is great but as soon as you stand up to them they
[2:12:44.860 --> 2:12:49.820]  collapse and I think that's starting to happen but go ahead paper tigers well you
[2:12:49.820 --> 2:12:53.340]  know I just have to add over something is that 30% of doctors that was the
[2:12:53.340 --> 2:12:58.540]  report out of England where they're about to do it but said they will not
[2:12:58.540 --> 2:13:04.820]  administer or take this white flu vaccine but even more 35% more said they
[2:13:04.820 --> 2:13:09.980]  didn't they weren't sure which means only only about 25% that they would do it
[2:13:09.980 --> 2:13:12.980]  well that's an effort every class I've been at that boy I've been a lot of
[2:13:12.980 --> 2:13:18.100]  class with my life you know it's I think the I think the public is gotten
[2:13:18.100 --> 2:13:22.020]  well-informed I think there's so much material you have done really I want to
[2:13:22.020 --> 2:13:26.220]  commend you you've done an incredible job you have talked and talked until
[2:13:26.220 --> 2:13:30.300]  people say hey wait a minute Alex may be telling us something that's real you
[2:13:30.300 --> 2:13:33.700]  know and and so it's really exciting you know I'm not I'm really not that
[2:13:33.700 --> 2:13:38.460]  worried what's gonna happen I've told all my families 50% of the families who
[2:13:38.460 --> 2:13:41.820]  come to homeschool their children so they're have a little bit of protection
[2:13:41.820 --> 2:13:47.140]  I've told those who go to school that you may have to keep your children out
[2:13:47.140 --> 2:13:51.540]  of school so what big deal what's gonna happen they end up at Harvard Yale
[2:13:51.540 --> 2:13:54.620]  because the kids don't go to school like that don't waste the time at school
[2:13:54.620 --> 2:13:59.180]  the ones who end up at the top school you know and but I think that that they
[2:13:59.180 --> 2:14:04.940]  are so afraid see I tell you Alex at conspiracy theory night fears theory the
[2:14:04.940 --> 2:14:08.620]  vaccine manufacturers know that the vaccine doesn't work they know that
[2:14:08.620 --> 2:14:13.660]  they absolutely know it's never worked you pointed it out the swine flu in 76
[2:14:13.660 --> 2:14:17.420]  didn't work every year the seasonal flu vaccine doesn't work well sir you're the
[2:14:17.420 --> 2:14:21.620]  medical doctor so take your time go through that and then walk through these
[2:14:21.620 --> 2:14:28.220]  mercury and squalene adjuvants how what they're causing in the body as a top
[2:14:28.220 --> 2:14:32.500]  medical doctor break it down for us well you know let me give you what I
[2:14:32.500 --> 2:14:39.260]  think their game plan is they weren't worried about giving the swine flu
[2:14:39.260 --> 2:14:45.420]  vaccine in September when they knew that swine flu wasn't gonna be an issue but
[2:14:45.420 --> 2:14:48.260]  now they're concerned it may be an issue and people may die from it I mean
[2:14:48.260 --> 2:14:52.140]  that's not even a question so they they can't they couldn't give the vaccine in
[2:14:52.140 --> 2:14:57.700]  September and then the majority of the flu season is between September at the
[2:14:57.700 --> 2:15:01.780]  end of October that's when the people get sick and die after that it can't
[2:15:01.780 --> 2:15:05.300]  tend to be milder no matter what that would have got 50 years of history of
[2:15:05.300 --> 2:15:10.660]  this and so they realized that that when this may be real if they gave the
[2:15:10.660 --> 2:15:15.460]  vaccine in September inoculated 300 million people's country and a hundred
[2:15:15.460 --> 2:15:19.820]  thousand people died their whole vaccine program with all the other childhood
[2:15:19.820 --> 2:15:23.380]  fixes could go down the drain so they took the vaccine that they had they put
[2:15:23.380 --> 2:15:27.940]  at the storage they said we can't come out with it till the end of October now
[2:15:27.940 --> 2:15:34.300]  John Holdren Dr. John Holdren not an MD not a medical doctor but yet he's the
[2:15:34.300 --> 2:15:38.980]  director of the White House office on science and technology policy you know
[2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:44.780]  and he said no it is so imperative that you have to water it down and give it in
[2:15:44.780 --> 2:15:47.980]  the middle of September the drug companies I'll come back to him I'm
[2:15:47.980 --> 2:15:51.460]  making this up but it and say oh we're happy to give you water down because
[2:15:51.460 --> 2:15:54.500]  we'll tell you it most probably doesn't work but now we're covered either way
[2:15:54.500 --> 2:15:58.700]  we've made our money in September and if it doesn't work we say you see it we
[2:15:58.700 --> 2:16:02.100]  have to wait until we have the right amount you know and so that's the whole
[2:16:02.100 --> 2:16:07.020]  thing you know all the other stuff the mercury the squalene you know our I
[2:16:07.020 --> 2:16:12.340]  mean mercury is the most known toxins and and now they're trying to back off
[2:16:12.340 --> 2:16:16.620]  and pretend it's not in the vaccine but it's not only Alex Jones or Sherry
[2:16:16.620 --> 2:16:20.780]  Tenpen he was saying it the Wall Street Journal ran the article the New York
[2:16:20.780 --> 2:16:24.340]  Times or on the run the article the Washington Post or I like all the
[2:16:24.340 --> 2:16:32.620]  Washington compost you know you know it's so out there you know I think it
[2:16:32.620 --> 2:16:39.220]  becomes alex one of these points where all these these misinformed or non
[2:16:39.220 --> 2:16:43.940]  thinkers you know go along go along until they say hey wait a minute I'm the
[2:16:43.940 --> 2:16:47.580]  next one is to be put into the concentration camp you know and I think
[2:16:47.580 --> 2:16:50.900]  and I could play something came out this morning which is great because I
[2:16:50.900 --> 2:16:55.860]  heard you mentioned Mike Adams so who's just just fabulous he came out with a
[2:16:55.860 --> 2:17:01.860]  video everyone's gone to YouTube look at his video it says don't inject me it
[2:17:01.860 --> 2:17:06.140]  is just great they just you know and you know I think now they're they're less
[2:17:06.140 --> 2:17:10.500]  worried about the damage they can cause with mercury and squalene both toxic
[2:17:10.500 --> 2:17:14.940]  chemicals squalene has never been approved for use to me now and they're
[2:17:14.940 --> 2:17:18.060]  more worried that they could lose the whole program what I mean the whole
[2:17:18.060 --> 2:17:23.860]  program the polio the DPT the measles most rebellious because once people start
[2:17:23.860 --> 2:17:27.660]  doubting all of a sudden the truth some cut coming out well sir I know three
[2:17:27.660 --> 2:17:31.100]  years ago you looked at the trials I covered it I had other medical doctors
[2:17:31.100 --> 2:17:37.220]  on I had families women whose children had died on the show just in the trials
[2:17:37.220 --> 2:17:43.340]  with the HPV shot the human papilloma Gardasil right and then now the FDA FDA
[2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:47.180]  comes out last week and says yeah we may put a warning out on this from your
[2:17:47.180 --> 2:17:54.820]  medical research is it the virus or the the adjunct or the thing that triggers
[2:17:54.820 --> 2:18:00.820]  the immune system why is that shot killing people well you know I I think
[2:18:00.820 --> 2:18:05.420]  all of them are but but this one is more remarkable because you're dealing with
[2:18:05.420 --> 2:18:12.100]  teenage young teenage girls and so it becomes more dramatic if a four-year-old
[2:18:12.100 --> 2:18:15.660]  or a five-year-old dies they can attribute it to something else you know
[2:18:15.660 --> 2:18:21.820]  asthma bronchitis you know but when they a healthy good-looking teenager who's
[2:18:21.820 --> 2:18:26.300]  a cheerleader who's 13 14 or 15 years old and those are the ones who've been
[2:18:26.300 --> 2:18:29.220]  dying because they're the ones are getting the vaccines right now and you
[2:18:29.220 --> 2:18:33.940]  know Stalin said at the best that that's the one person is the tragedy the death
[2:18:33.940 --> 2:18:39.340]  of 10,000 is statistic and I think we finally taken you know what to do you
[2:18:39.340 --> 2:18:44.060]  know I don't know you know I don't know the answer except Dr. Mendelssohn back
[2:18:44.060 --> 2:18:48.380]  in the 70s just made the blanket statement after he was the National
[2:18:48.380 --> 2:18:51.860]  Medical Director of Head Start which means he was the top that pediatrician
[2:18:51.860 --> 2:18:56.180]  the country when it came to the government program he made a statement
[2:18:56.180 --> 2:19:02.540]  every single vaccine causes neurological damage and that was even before we knew
[2:19:02.540 --> 2:19:08.220]  about the mercury before we knew about the aluminum that he just he just had
[2:19:08.220 --> 2:19:13.300]  this global vision of being involved in seeing what was happening and I think
[2:19:13.300 --> 2:19:17.180]  that everyone's got a piece of the puzzle Alex and so to say it's only the
[2:19:17.180 --> 2:19:20.900]  mercury only the squalene or the aluminum or the border fetal tissue you
[2:19:20.900 --> 2:19:24.780]  know of or the Neomyster strep the mysand which are all so it's not just the
[2:19:24.780 --> 2:19:28.860]  adjuvant since the cocktail I had Dr. Russell Blalock on last week the
[2:19:28.860 --> 2:19:35.220]  prestigious brain surgeon he said that brains are looking different for
[2:19:35.220 --> 2:19:39.380]  people's ages people don't have memory that people are brain damaged and I want
[2:19:39.380 --> 2:19:42.500]  to talk to you as a medical doctor we come back about that he said it's
[2:19:42.500 --> 2:19:49.540]  vaccines it's the pesticides it's the heavy metals in the foods it's a cocktail
[2:19:49.540 --> 2:19:55.220]  but what is different today than 30 40 years ago Dr. Mayer Eisenstein prestigious
[2:19:55.220 --> 2:20:00.780]  doctor huge practice we'll talk about how the Amish don't get autism
[2:20:00.780 --> 2:20:05.340]  heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year maybe

[2:22:00.620 --> 2:22:06.380]  in the new world orders war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the
[2:22:06.380 --> 2:22:10.940]  spear we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as
[2:22:10.940 --> 2:22:16.940]  powerful just as strong just as well funded. The Obama deception completely
[2:22:16.940 --> 2:22:20.740]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American

[2:22:26.140 --> 2:22:30.500]  have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[2:22:30.500 --> 2:22:35.740]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[2:22:35.740 --> 2:22:41.140]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right it's about a one-world government this

[2:24:19.620 --> 2:24:27.540]  I sleep good at night ladies and gentlemen because I know not just
[2:24:27.540 --> 2:24:32.260]  White House Science are his own government policy book Ecoscience but
[2:24:32.260 --> 2:24:37.380]  from the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 89-96 from the
[2:24:37.380 --> 2:24:43.580]  State Department of Random 200 the Royal Commission on Population 49 from the

[2:24:46.900 --> 2:24:52.340]  even 80 years ago. It's just amazing stuff that it is eugenics that it's
[2:24:52.340 --> 2:24:57.980]  cold-blooded they see us as animals and they're carrying this out and I know
[2:24:57.980 --> 2:25:02.300]  these vaccines are killing people but as Dr. Eisenstein just said the little
[2:25:02.300 --> 2:25:07.100]  known secret is that these vaccines don't work even if you believe they work
[2:25:07.100 --> 2:25:11.380]  they never get the mutation right doc you want to explain that to people well
[2:25:11.380 --> 2:25:17.740]  it's not only the the swine flu because in 1976 we have the best experiment on
[2:25:17.740 --> 2:25:23.220]  vaccines ever that was when Gerald Ford President Gerald Ford felt that we were
[2:25:23.220 --> 2:25:28.820]  gonna have a swine flu epidemic and ordered the the inoculation of every
[2:25:28.820 --> 2:25:34.060]  single American well they got through about 15 or 20 percent and this ran
[2:25:34.060 --> 2:25:37.860]  for about five or six weeks and all of a sudden they realized they were people
[2:25:37.860 --> 2:25:42.900]  dying from the vaccine but no one was dying from the from the swine flu and
[2:25:42.900 --> 2:25:47.340]  so what they did is they immediately ended the program they claimed only 40
[2:25:47.340 --> 2:25:51.540]  or 50 people died but Alex I can guarantee you without knowing the
[2:25:51.540 --> 2:25:56.900]  actual data if 40 or 50 people died they wouldn't have stopped the program my
[2:25:56.900 --> 2:26:01.260]  feeling is hundreds died and they claim there are 5,000 people who got a
[2:26:01.260 --> 2:26:06.020]  neurological disorder from the vaccine called Guyan Barre where you have
[2:26:06.020 --> 2:26:10.500]  temporary paralysis but many times complete paralysis which never recovers
[2:26:10.500 --> 2:26:15.260]  they claim 5,000 I believe it's got to be at least 50,000 because I know almost
[2:26:15.260 --> 2:26:19.100]  every doctor who knew one or two patients who had Guillain Barre from the
[2:26:19.100 --> 2:26:23.220]  vaccine it's not possible five thousand a very very small number you know and
[2:26:23.220 --> 2:26:26.860]  they wouldn't cut it out because of that and and there was a warning just now in
[2:26:26.860 --> 2:26:32.780]  England from the head of neurological services that they believe that this
[2:26:32.780 --> 2:26:37.500]  vaccine will also cause neurological damage hello we've known this for 30
[2:26:37.500 --> 2:26:42.620]  years you know yes sir and the doctor being honest was citing internal CDC
[2:26:42.620 --> 2:26:48.420]  reports so they know right exactly and so so we already know it for 76 that this
[2:26:48.420 --> 2:26:52.420]  flu vaccine doesn't work but but it's more than just a flu vaccine when you
[2:26:52.420 --> 2:26:56.940]  take a look and no one's better than Dr. Sherry Tenpenny I mean she is just the
[2:26:56.940 --> 2:27:01.580]  best researcher I've ever my life met I mean she gets every liquid she's so
[2:27:01.580 --> 2:27:05.220]  gentle-looking Alex that everyone is willing to give her the data thinking
[2:27:05.220 --> 2:27:09.380]  that she's not as radical as she is you know and and you take a look at her
[2:27:09.380 --> 2:27:13.300]  books and you take a look at her writing and take a look at the data and what
[2:27:13.300 --> 2:27:19.140]  is the data show there isn't one disease that a vaccine has really caused to be
[2:27:19.140 --> 2:27:23.460]  eliminated and if you start with these we don't have a vaccine tuberculosis why
[2:27:23.460 --> 2:27:29.140]  doesn't exist today a rocky mountain speed is a fever yellow yellow fever
[2:27:29.140 --> 2:27:34.580]  plague cholera we don't have vaccines for these get all these these diseases
[2:27:34.580 --> 2:27:38.740]  were very rampant a hundred years ago don't exist anymore and then when you
[2:27:38.740 --> 2:27:44.140]  look at the charts like polio dipheria tetanus whooping cough they take a look
[2:27:44.140 --> 2:27:50.940]  the disappearance of these diseases was almost it just kept going from a 80
[2:27:50.940 --> 2:27:54.820]  years ago there was a lot of these diseases and now less and less then the
[2:27:54.820 --> 2:27:59.140]  vaccine comes in the vaccine should change the curve that should drop right
[2:27:59.140 --> 2:28:02.580]  down it doesn't it continues at the same curve so you think that the
[2:28:02.580 --> 2:28:08.140]  tuberculosis curve no vaccine overlay let me stop you because I'm aware of the
[2:28:08.140 --> 2:28:13.420]  Australian US British Canadian data the graphs can all be superimposed like I
[2:28:13.420 --> 2:28:18.900]  should even dig one up online and post it because of indoor plumbing because of
[2:28:18.900 --> 2:28:24.220]  sanitation because of better nutrition you see starting a hundred years ago a
[2:28:24.220 --> 2:28:31.180]  massive plunge in all these diseases then vaccines worldwide become popular
[2:28:31.180 --> 2:28:36.260]  and the diseases actually across the board start going back up proving that
[2:28:36.260 --> 2:28:39.580]  these are hurting people's immune systems causing problems I'm not stealing
[2:28:39.580 --> 2:28:44.380]  your thunder though it's just you're moving quickly it is conclusive and
[2:28:44.380 --> 2:28:48.780]  that's why the eugenicist want to shoot you up the evidence shows is because
[2:28:48.780 --> 2:28:55.140]  they believe they're naturally coming in to reapply diseases that handwashing and
[2:28:55.140 --> 2:28:59.620]  better nutrition and running water have gotten rid of go ahead sir but you know
[2:28:59.620 --> 2:29:03.900]  let me tell you are a hundred percent right but here's what's happened there's
[2:29:03.900 --> 2:29:08.580]  not a lot of treatment for many of these diseases we mentioned and so they have to
[2:29:08.580 --> 2:29:13.500]  come up with a real scheme and that is how do we create chronic illness arthritis
[2:29:13.500 --> 2:29:18.420]  cancer heart disease where people live for a substantial amount of time and let
[2:29:18.420 --> 2:29:22.500]  take drugs for the rest of their life and a lot and that's what we thought we've
[2:29:22.500 --> 2:29:27.020]  replaced infectious disease with chronic illness and I'm convinced the
[2:29:27.020 --> 2:29:31.740]  vaccines are the number one cause of our chronic illness and by the way you said
[2:29:31.740 --> 2:29:36.980]  that in books years ago and on the show now we have mainstream news reporting in
[2:29:36.980 --> 2:29:41.180]  live in laboratory test that it's giving the rats they give the vaccines to
[2:29:41.180 --> 2:29:46.380]  chronic hardcore arthritis we'll be right back and talk about that with Dr.
[2:29:46.380 --> 2:29:50.820]  Eisenstein
[2:29:50.820 --> 2:30:00.020]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:30:00.020 --> 2:30:04.460]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[2:30:04.460 --> 2:30:08.140]  solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation could
[2:30:08.140 --> 2:30:11.980]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[2:30:11.980 --> 2:30:16.100]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[2:30:16.100 --> 2:30:19.780]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:30:19.780 --> 2:30:23.980]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[2:30:23.980 --> 2:30:27.460]  is dangerously overloaded especially with the high-demand summer months ahead
[2:30:27.460 --> 2:30:31.420]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again every
[2:30:31.420 --> 2:30:35.100]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages number
[2:30:35.100 --> 2:30:39.060]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[2:30:39.060 --> 2:30:42.900]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[2:30:42.900 --> 2:30:46.860]  from science a longtime sponsor of ours you can get more information at
[2:30:46.860 --> 2:30:52.980]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[2:30:52.980 --> 2:31:00.460]  doesn't own the Sun yet so go to my solar backup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365

[2:31:55.780 --> 2:32:02.940]  number 1-800-409-5633 hello friends this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to
[2:32:02.940 --> 2:32:06.700]  ask yourself this question do you really know what's in your tap water in a
[2:32:06.700 --> 2:32:10.740]  recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor they found that
[2:32:10.740 --> 2:32:14.740]  over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water
[2:32:14.740 --> 2:32:18.620]  many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune
[2:32:18.620 --> 2:32:22.580]  and developmental system diseases now what are you going to do about it the
[2:32:22.580 --> 2:32:27.300]  acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[2:32:27.300 --> 2:32:31.180]  you and your family's drinking water the acola blue 28 produces up to seven
[2:32:31.180 --> 2:32:34.540]  gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art
[2:32:34.540 --> 2:32:39.180]  carbon filtration reverse osmosis and ultra violent light sterilization
[2:32:39.180 --> 2:32:43.980]  techniques that's right clean water right from the air you breathe order today
[2:32:43.980 --> 2:32:51.860]  by calling 1-800-691-6043 that's 1-800-691-6043 or visit a
[2:32:51.860 --> 2:33:09.140]  colo blue on the web at www.ecollovlu.com today that's a colo blue.com
[2:33:21.860 --> 2:33:26.140]  you know we just haven't had the world premiere today of the new trailer for
[2:33:26.140 --> 2:33:34.460]  fall of the republic. Barmos is making a film called invisible
[2:33:34.460 --> 2:33:41.180]  impot and it's amazing research he's working on the same for years it's
[2:33:41.180 --> 2:33:45.020]  coming out early next year they're gonna have the world premiere of that it's not
[2:33:45.020 --> 2:33:50.900]  even on YouTube yet coming up next hour here on air at prisonplanet.tv
[2:33:50.900 --> 2:33:55.540]  if you're a member you'll be able to see the video here for the first time if
[2:33:55.540 --> 2:33:59.380]  you're a prison planet dot TV member but if you're not you'll be able to hear
[2:33:59.380 --> 2:34:02.020]  obviously the audio from it and then coming up later this evening you're
[2:34:02.020 --> 2:34:05.940]  gonna have an article Barmos wrote and the trailer at the Alex Jones channel on
[2:34:05.940 --> 2:34:10.180]  YouTube it will be up in the next two hours or so but world premiere coming
[2:34:10.180 --> 2:34:16.620]  up at the bottom of the next hour so exactly exactly one hour from now our
[2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:19.820]  59 minutes if you want to get technical we'll play that here got a bunch of other
[2:34:19.820 --> 2:34:24.060]  news I want to go over we're gonna I know we have Donna and Bill and Gene and Pat
[2:34:24.060 --> 2:34:27.980]  and I don't want to hang up on these callers but you were here before we got
[2:34:27.980 --> 2:34:32.500]  Dr. Eisenstein on you can either change your question to him about the flu or
[2:34:32.500 --> 2:34:36.620]  the new world order or eugenics or call back another day I'm gonna give the
[2:34:36.620 --> 2:34:43.820]  number out 1-800-259-9231 now doctor you're a humble guy you're one of the
[2:34:43.820 --> 2:34:47.900]  leading experts on this because the government likes to cover up their own
[2:34:47.900 --> 2:34:52.660]  studies their own test big pharma does or take the aspartame trials it killed
[2:34:52.660 --> 2:34:56.980]  almost all the Reese's monkeys that they gave it to but then they use that data
[2:34:56.980 --> 2:35:01.260]  by removing the dead monkeys to say get it approved you they play all sorts of
[2:35:01.260 --> 2:35:04.940]  games you're a leading expert because you have one of the biggest practices in
[2:35:04.940 --> 2:35:10.380]  the country I mean you're quite quite the productive person not just you know
[2:35:10.380 --> 2:35:13.700]  do you have a medical examiner's license or are you a lawyer or multiple
[2:35:13.700 --> 2:35:19.300]  medical degrees you've got a huge huge practice of homeschoolers regular folks
[2:35:19.300 --> 2:35:25.620]  and then you also watch the Amish and know them tell folks well finish your
[2:35:25.620 --> 2:35:32.260]  point about how the vaccines don't work and then let's get into just the evidence
[2:35:32.260 --> 2:35:37.060]  right there that you see public schools where some schools a third of the school
[2:35:37.060 --> 2:35:42.420]  have got neurological disorders supposedly or or their brains have been
[2:35:42.420 --> 2:35:46.180]  rotted by the vaccines and other chemicals then meanwhile the Amish you
[2:35:46.180 --> 2:35:50.180]  don't you don't ever see that you don't see autism that's exactly right you don't
[2:35:50.180 --> 2:35:53.940]  mean that was I didn't even really know that one where the other until then
[2:35:53.940 --> 2:35:58.540]  Olbsted who was at the time a senior medical writer for United Press
[2:35:58.540 --> 2:36:02.660]  internationally came to Chicago he heard about our practice now I want to know
[2:36:02.660 --> 2:36:07.540]  Alex it's not only me Dr. Rosie Dr. Shattower Dr. Zumbagan and 20 other
[2:36:07.540 --> 2:36:12.260]  doctors who worked with me over the last 30 plus years and we've always had a
[2:36:12.260 --> 2:36:17.740]  practice that gave vaccine choice to families and you asked earlier what's
[2:36:17.740 --> 2:36:22.260]  the difference from 35 years ago but 35 years ago they didn't give 58 vaccines
[2:36:22.260 --> 2:36:26.700]  to children the first couple years of life we gave 10 or 12 still most
[2:36:26.700 --> 2:36:31.980]  probably a problematic but the problem was the fraction was today so Dan
[2:36:31.980 --> 2:36:36.300]  Olbsted comes to Chicago he spends time with our practice and talks to all the
[2:36:36.300 --> 2:36:40.700]  doctors and he said you know where's the all where is the autism show me the
[2:36:40.700 --> 2:36:44.620]  office I said you know I want to know Alex I barely knew what autism was I'd
[2:36:44.620 --> 2:36:48.740]  read about in the textbooks but that was about it never saw a case you know and
[2:36:48.740 --> 2:36:52.260]  we have been delivering babies at home that's mainly what we've done there's
[2:36:52.260 --> 2:36:56.460]  still continues to do it and we're close to 20,000 babies along the way that we've
[2:36:56.460 --> 2:37:00.860]  delivered at home but here's the shift in our practice in the last 10 or 15
[2:37:00.860 --> 2:37:04.580]  years that become more and more vocal about vaccines our vaccine rates have
[2:37:04.580 --> 2:37:10.660]  gone from 10% the practice to 9% to 5% where now it's almost non-existent the
[2:37:10.660 --> 2:37:15.300]  only reason we don't become a vaccine-free practice it goes by partners
[2:37:15.300 --> 2:37:18.780]  that were with me for more than 25 years who've never vaccinated their children
[2:37:18.780 --> 2:37:23.940]  said to me mayor if we give such a hard line we're gonna lose thousands of
[2:37:23.940 --> 2:37:27.540]  people when they come realize that they don't have to vaccinate their children
[2:37:27.540 --> 2:37:31.780]  and also it became obvious it's more than just autism we have virtually no
[2:37:31.780 --> 2:37:37.620]  asthma virtually no diabetes virtually no allergies you know all these chronic
[2:37:37.620 --> 2:37:42.300]  conditions that children today suffer from and those people say all that
[2:37:42.300 --> 2:37:47.700]  there's there's no real increase in the autism we're just counting different
[2:37:47.700 --> 2:37:53.020]  well how do you count all you said so well the neurological problems the
[2:37:53.020 --> 2:37:57.260]  school the best look I'm gonna stop you right there yeah I don't need to be a
[2:37:57.260 --> 2:38:02.060]  rocket scientist to know that when I went to see movies like Dumbo when I was a
[2:38:02.060 --> 2:38:07.220]  kid or I went to take my sister who's 14 years younger than me you know when I
[2:38:07.220 --> 2:38:10.780]  was in high school and college I'd take her my parents would say will you come
[2:38:10.780 --> 2:38:15.660]  over and babysit next week and take her to a movie you never saw autistic
[2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:21.100]  children I'm on the green belt I'm at the mall I take my kids every few months
[2:38:21.100 --> 2:38:27.180]  to a movie it's like two or three rows are in there autistic I mean they are
[2:38:27.180 --> 2:38:31.620]  dead that the schools and people say oh well that's just false diagnosis it's
[2:38:31.620 --> 2:38:35.100]  not false diagnosis when you're on the green belt and there's autistic kids
[2:38:35.100 --> 2:38:39.180]  running around screaming everywhere completely out of their minds I mean
[2:38:39.180 --> 2:38:43.260]  they but they're under chemical attack and and we've seen autism rates go from
[2:38:43.260 --> 2:38:49.500]  what 1 in 25,000 27 years ago to 1 in 86 now the feds own numbers I mean boy
[2:38:49.500 --> 2:38:53.380]  and that's that's the most severe case all this has to be looked at the same
[2:38:53.380 --> 2:38:58.340]  thing what dr. Nelson said 30 years ago what's there has been ADD ADHD and
[2:38:58.340 --> 2:39:02.620]  autism just the spectrum you know how severely your brain is the damage like
[2:39:02.620 --> 2:39:06.760]  dr. Blaylock said you know uh and that's the only difference and we saw
[2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:10.300]  virtually none of this but even more impressive may have been when Blue Cross
[2:39:10.300 --> 2:39:14.820]  called me this is about two three years ago and they said to me because I we
[2:39:14.820 --> 2:39:19.380]  also have a small HMO group that were part of part of Blue Cross and they said
[2:39:19.380 --> 2:39:25.180]  the the asthma rate in in their network was 12% we had one child out of a
[2:39:25.180 --> 2:39:30.460]  thousand with asthma you know and and they have a great definition to emerge
[2:39:30.460 --> 2:39:34.740]  zero business the one year for any respiratory illness or one hospitalization
[2:39:34.740 --> 2:39:38.460]  so you can't say one person doing one thing one person doing nothing and they
[2:39:38.460 --> 2:39:42.220]  wanted to know else you have to hear this this is very fascinating so I go to
[2:39:42.220 --> 2:39:46.220]  the meeting there at Blue Cross and they said to me doc why do you have such low
[2:39:46.220 --> 2:39:49.780]  rates they said well we're the best doctors in the world just come on tell
[2:39:49.780 --> 2:39:53.500]  us the truth so I said why don't you tell me what you think they have all the
[2:39:53.500 --> 2:39:57.020]  records there for all the HMO patients none of these children are vaccinated
[2:39:57.020 --> 2:40:01.860]  how incredible that was frightening that's why I realized that Alex Jones not
[2:40:01.860 --> 2:40:07.100]  only is right not only has had an impact the country you know but this is this is
[2:40:07.100 --> 2:40:13.140]  not conspiracy theory this is over now well that's what's crazy about this why
[2:40:13.140 --> 2:40:16.980]  would these corporate minions who aren't part of that upper crust of eugenicists
[2:40:16.980 --> 2:40:22.740]  why would anybody want to do this I mean I've been on vacation I've been at the
[2:40:22.740 --> 2:40:26.980]  mall I've been at the grocery store and you'll see an autistic child you know
[2:40:26.980 --> 2:40:30.900]  ten years old and diapers and I'm not obnoxious about it I want to know and I
[2:40:30.900 --> 2:40:36.060]  walk over and I say when did your child become autistic and they always say
[2:40:36.060 --> 2:40:41.620]  after a victim 18 months old third round of shots he was running around talking
[2:40:41.620 --> 2:40:49.860]  singing now he now he does this and the child's and I mean it's it's and then I
[2:40:49.860 --> 2:40:53.940]  read about how when your kid has the convulsion that night they didn't send the
[2:40:53.940 --> 2:40:57.700]  police to arrest you because they do a CAT scan and see the brain swelling and
[2:40:57.700 --> 2:41:01.140]  say you shook your kid's head when you're a medical doctor to have countless
[2:41:01.140 --> 2:41:07.340]  others on clearly they know the mercury and the squalene is is causing an auto
[2:41:07.340 --> 2:41:11.460]  immune response and making the brain swell so then they don't just brain
[2:41:11.460 --> 2:41:15.100]  damage your kid with a chemical lobotomy now they're gonna arrest you for it too
[2:41:15.100 --> 2:41:19.740]  we have a little bit else you think everyone in Germany were Nazis every
[2:41:19.740 --> 2:41:23.820]  one of the people everyone the Germans but you know there's a point that the
[2:41:23.820 --> 2:41:28.260]  more so-called quote intellectual as society becomes and I put that word in
[2:41:28.260 --> 2:41:32.780]  quotes not smart you know they all of a sudden defer to the experts defer to the
[2:41:32.780 --> 2:41:37.100]  experts they stop thinking and then the brain goes soft and all of a sudden you
[2:41:37.100 --> 2:41:42.220]  you you can't imagine that all these experts are wrong you know and it
[2:41:42.220 --> 2:41:46.100]  doesn't take very many and that's what you said they're a paper tiger they're a
[2:41:46.100 --> 2:41:50.140]  blessed paper tiger and I think what's happening now it's just like at the
[2:41:50.140 --> 2:41:54.820]  town hall meetings Alex Jones hired and spend money to hire all these people to
[2:41:54.820 --> 2:41:58.980]  go to town hall meetings I don't think so you didn't hire the 80-year-old woman
[2:41:58.980 --> 2:42:02.660]  who was in a wheelchair who's screaming how ridiculous this is and they're
[2:42:02.660 --> 2:42:06.420]  calling her a hoodlum you know it's just it's all the same you know it's not
[2:42:06.420 --> 2:42:09.980]  working anymore and that's the problem all of a sudden it's not working they
[2:42:09.980 --> 2:42:14.500]  no longer could just say it that's true Chicago politics that is best just saying
[2:42:14.500 --> 2:42:18.940]  enough say the lie enough time and people will believe it I mean I think that
[2:42:18.940 --> 2:42:24.100]  it's it's just a lot of control and I want to know that autism of all the
[2:42:24.100 --> 2:42:28.740]  things in my 30 plus years in medicine I've never seen anything as devastating
[2:42:28.740 --> 2:42:33.580]  to a family cancer nothing compared to it heart disease nothing those children
[2:42:33.580 --> 2:42:38.900]  are alive they just have a short life autism the parents have no life no life
[2:42:38.900 --> 2:42:43.260]  and these are the most brave parents in the world who take care of these children
[2:42:43.260 --> 2:42:46.660]  you know something I was at a conference in California last week an
[2:42:46.660 --> 2:42:50.620]  autism conference and I realized something I hadn't realized before I
[2:42:50.620 --> 2:42:55.460]  never met both a husband and wife together because one of us always at
[2:42:55.460 --> 2:43:01.140]  home take care of their child how status that you know that you can't you can't
[2:43:01.140 --> 2:43:05.220]  administer a hand over the care of somebody else that's how difficult it
[2:43:05.220 --> 2:43:09.380]  well the child is in a prison and the parents are in a prison and it doesn't
[2:43:09.380 --> 2:43:15.780]  have to be this way but then on top of it but going back to the Amish I mean
[2:43:15.780 --> 2:43:19.940]  you're right this has been even picked up in national news that you don't have
[2:43:19.940 --> 2:43:22.820]  these autistic children with the Amish you don't have these high rates of
[2:43:22.820 --> 2:43:29.260]  cancer you don't have these rates of the asthma from your medical research and
[2:43:29.260 --> 2:43:32.100]  the other research you've gone over what is it doing I mean from the other
[2:43:32.100 --> 2:43:37.260]  doctors we've had on and endocrinologist and epidemiologist and brain
[2:43:37.260 --> 2:43:42.860]  surgeons a neurologist they basically say that what's in the vaccines causes
[2:43:42.860 --> 2:43:48.980]  all sorts of inflammation and damage and burnout of the pancreas burnout of
[2:43:48.980 --> 2:43:54.300]  different glands all sorts of just total disruption in the body I mean is
[2:43:54.300 --> 2:43:58.860]  that I know that's an oversimplification and that's a simple location I go back
[2:43:58.860 --> 2:44:02.660]  to yeah I'm kind of an old-time general practitioner that's what I'm like you
[2:44:02.660 --> 2:44:06.500]  know and I'm pretty good as my wife says that when I hear the truth I seem
[2:44:06.500 --> 2:44:11.780]  to know it when Dr. Mendelssohn said it over 30 years ago every vaccine causes
[2:44:11.780 --> 2:44:15.900]  neurological damage and then you've got the brilliant people like Dr. Blalock
[2:44:15.900 --> 2:44:20.900]  and Dr. Boyd Haley who now give you the reason why it's causing it we know we
[2:44:20.900 --> 2:44:25.500]  see it every Alex Jones and there aren't very many of you who goes from the mall
[2:44:25.500 --> 2:44:30.140]  sees it all they're doing is giving you why it's happened you know I have made
[2:44:30.140 --> 2:44:34.580]  the statement Alex now for more than three years there is no autism in our
[2:44:34.580 --> 2:44:37.580]  prayer I use the word virtually because I don't know every single family I mean
[2:44:37.580 --> 2:44:42.180]  everyone some may have left me with the California I have yet to get one letter
[2:44:42.180 --> 2:44:47.300]  and boy do I get a lot of hate e-mail hate e-mails hate emails at times you
[2:44:47.300 --> 2:44:52.060]  know what I when I talked about Obamacare is not for this doctor my god I got
[2:44:52.060 --> 2:44:56.660]  people sending me back emails you better apologize to our president I see it's
[2:44:56.660 --> 2:45:00.060]  not my president I didn't vote for him oh yeah they love it they love to now say
[2:45:00.060 --> 2:45:03.260]  you can't even criticizing right well I mean the issue is I've read over the
[2:45:03.260 --> 2:45:06.940]  three different bills and everything people say is in there is in there and
[2:45:06.940 --> 2:45:11.140]  more and we've shown the subsections and they use this big lie like they say we
[2:45:11.140 --> 2:45:14.580]  have introduced any anti-gun bills they've introduced all these horrible
[2:45:14.580 --> 2:45:18.620]  ones we've listed them they say oh that's not in there and then you know all
[2:45:18.620 --> 2:45:23.060]  this government control all this rationing of care that's the European
[2:45:23.060 --> 2:45:28.380]  model we know but also forcing more vaccines more drugs we know that that's
[2:45:28.380 --> 2:45:32.420]  all in there but I also watch CNN and these other channels they keep showing
[2:45:32.420 --> 2:45:36.300]  I just am broke and I don't have money for my illness and I need the free
[2:45:36.300 --> 2:45:40.860]  healthcare they don't explain that it's only going to bankrupt things more and
[2:45:40.860 --> 2:45:44.540]  that government isn't going to give you that health care they're going to take
[2:45:44.540 --> 2:45:48.060]  money out of your paycheck and then give you an aspirin for a heart attack I
[2:45:48.060 --> 2:45:54.300]  mean but but again they're selling feel sorry for me you'll be nice Americans
[2:45:54.300 --> 2:45:58.940]  give in to big government again and people are wise now they don't when
[2:45:58.940 --> 2:46:01.900]  somebody beats them over the head and says you're a racist if you don't do what
[2:46:01.900 --> 2:46:05.980]  we say you don't care about sick people if you don't do what we say people see
[2:46:05.980 --> 2:46:09.460]  right through that it's the most gracious country in the world God bless
[2:46:09.460 --> 2:46:15.180]  America my father came from Poland he lived in Russia he was a rabbi he was a
[2:46:15.180 --> 2:46:19.700]  good businessman came to America my dad spoke nine languages and he said he's
[2:46:19.700 --> 2:46:23.860]  traveled the whole world when he came to America I was a year old when he came to
[2:46:23.860 --> 2:46:29.020]  America they after the war and he every morning he got up at that God bless
[2:46:29.020 --> 2:46:33.220]  America there is no country more gracious that will take care of people
[2:46:33.220 --> 2:46:37.700]  everyone's taken care of in this country mr. president you don't know what the
[2:46:37.700 --> 2:46:41.500]  blessed heck you talked about if you got forbid you know have a
[2:46:41.500 --> 2:46:45.180]  injury you go to any emergency room they take care of you that bill isn't
[2:46:45.180 --> 2:46:48.740]  passed out to someone else the doctor in the hospital take care of you they
[2:46:48.740 --> 2:46:53.060]  don't get paid exactly my dad's a physician and he says they were taught
[2:46:53.060 --> 2:46:56.900]  in medical school they were taught that's what you do that about 20 30% of
[2:46:56.900 --> 2:47:01.180]  your practice is supposed to be free exactly and and then now under this
[2:47:01.180 --> 2:47:05.340]  Obamacare it actually takes that liability off the hospitals off the
[2:47:05.340 --> 2:47:10.140]  doctors and off the insurance companies and then you get government care the
[2:47:10.140 --> 2:47:14.780]  government says they can't even read the 1300 page bill but they're going to
[2:47:14.780 --> 2:47:19.060]  now practice medicine and then Obama gives these speeches where he says what
[2:47:19.060 --> 2:47:23.940]  tests you need and he's now dr. Obama yeah I know let me tell you some there
[2:47:23.940 --> 2:47:28.940]  are a couple of doctors in Congress and and the Senate and every one of them is
[2:47:28.940 --> 2:47:32.900]  against this it Republican or Democrat I find that very fascinating you know what
[2:47:32.900 --> 2:47:38.180]  and you know and but yeah I think you're right Alex I think what we're
[2:47:38.180 --> 2:47:41.700]  they're seeing through it and so your message is coming through it really God
[2:47:41.700 --> 2:47:45.380]  bless you what you've been doing you know it's been just just incredible because
[2:47:45.380 --> 2:47:49.180]  you know who would have thought that two or three years ago you know that that
[2:47:49.180 --> 2:47:53.180]  I mean it's just absolutely amazing but I could like going back to the vaccine
[2:47:53.180 --> 2:47:57.860]  issues what can we do because we don't have to bury our head in the sand right
[2:47:57.860 --> 2:48:02.140]  now there are some very simple simple treatments just washing the hands nonsense
[2:48:02.140 --> 2:48:05.620]  you know what he's supposed to tell you know what what don't kiss anyone don't
[2:48:05.620 --> 2:48:11.380]  shake your hand wash your head you know the nonsense because you know I mean
[2:48:11.380 --> 2:48:15.500]  it's clearly good hygiene before you sit down to eat to wash your hands I mean
[2:48:15.500 --> 2:48:20.180]  that's but this business what they're talking about image without substance
[2:48:20.180 --> 2:48:24.180]  and I could tell you that there's enough evidence that vitamin D has made a
[2:48:24.180 --> 2:48:29.220]  difference that we looked at the 1918 Spanish flu and the most interesting
[2:48:29.220 --> 2:48:34.060]  thing were the sailors we're warm ever 1918 the sailors on the ship at the lowest
[2:48:34.060 --> 2:48:40.660]  mortality from the Spanish flu the soldiers in the in the barracks and in
[2:48:40.660 --> 2:48:47.220]  the foxhole at the highest mortality so any sunshine again we need to get more
[2:48:47.220 --> 2:48:52.500]  sun more sun more sun and and and if not you know a bit of vitamin D I mean it's
[2:48:52.500 --> 2:48:56.540]  inexpensive it's cheap you know no one can make a big living selling it you know
[2:48:56.540 --> 2:48:59.780]  what you want you want your vitamin D you want to get your vitamin D level and
[2:48:59.780 --> 2:49:03.380]  of course that's the old wives tale is you need to get more son you're gonna
[2:49:03.380 --> 2:49:07.340]  get sick you need to get outside right three of my grandmother used to tell me
[2:49:07.340 --> 2:49:10.340]  Alex but I'd be sitting with nice as the mayor what are you doing in the house
[2:49:10.340 --> 2:49:15.380]  it's beautiful get outside you know get over the sun I want to how powerful this
[2:49:15.380 --> 2:49:20.180]  message is you know it's been 35 years of deception by the American Academy of
[2:49:20.180 --> 2:49:25.340]  Dermatology saying this gun son will give you skin cancer well that's true how
[2:49:25.340 --> 2:49:29.900]  can we have more skin cancer now than ever and no one's in the sun well I'll
[2:49:29.900 --> 2:49:33.460]  tell you why just what you said sunscreen they've got chemicals and
[2:49:33.460 --> 2:49:37.940]  poisons that just as bad as the vaccine no one should be taking sunscreen you
[2:49:37.940 --> 2:49:43.740]  know I mean it's unbelievable it's almost pure aluminum it's
[2:49:43.740 --> 2:49:48.420]  incredible we're meant to get sun it's what our whole body drives on all the
[2:49:48.420 --> 2:49:52.100]  studies in northern Europe with the highest rates of suicide by law they
[2:49:52.100 --> 2:49:58.140]  stick sun lamps in suicide rate plunges because our eyes are meant to get sun
[2:49:58.140 --> 2:50:02.380]  we are meant to get sun and yes we're meant for our skin to get spots on it
[2:50:02.380 --> 2:50:06.340]  and get old we're meant I mean this is what we're designed we live on a planet
[2:50:06.340 --> 2:50:10.820]  northern Europeans have white skin so they get more because you have less sun
[2:50:10.820 --> 2:50:17.580]  in the north you want the sun you need the sun it's good that's the right you
[2:50:17.580 --> 2:50:22.300]  know and and I'm giving a paper in December I'm presenting a paper at the
[2:50:22.300 --> 2:50:28.900]  American Academy of Anti-Aging and the topic is low vitamin D levels the root
[2:50:28.900 --> 2:50:33.060]  cause of cancer there's enough evidence that's most probably true no longer
[2:50:33.060 --> 2:50:38.020]  conspiracy theory already people are believing it well imagine the conspiracy
[2:50:38.020 --> 2:50:42.100]  theory it's like when I see ads for grass-fed beef it's like bizarre to feed
[2:50:42.100 --> 2:50:46.860]  cows grass instead of dead cows and it's bizarre to go oh we're supposed to get
[2:50:46.860 --> 2:50:53.140]  sun or wow global warming is good it's caused by the sun the sun imagine it

[2:53:04.540 --> 2:53:08.420]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[2:53:08.420 --> 2:53:12.460]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[2:53:12.460 --> 2:53:15.880]  true seeds and all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[2:53:15.880 --> 2:53:19.780]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science
[2:53:19.780 --> 2:53:24.540]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival

[2:54:07.420 --> 2:54:11.460]  well I'm really honored to have Dr. Eisenstein with us a little bit of the
[2:54:11.460 --> 2:54:17.700]  next hour we've got the world premiere of Barmas' new film trailer of that as
[2:54:17.700 --> 2:54:21.740]  well I meant to have our first trailer out weeks ago and I got behind and so we're
[2:54:21.740 --> 2:54:24.780]  just releasing these both at the same time so that's always exciting and
[2:54:24.780 --> 2:54:28.140]  interesting it's not anywhere yet it'll air here first at president planet dot
[2:54:28.140 --> 2:54:32.620]  tv as we saw on the cast on the radio Dr. Eisenstein there's so many other
[2:54:32.620 --> 2:54:37.460]  points what do you see happening then because I agree with you this is all a
[2:54:37.460 --> 2:54:43.100]  fluid situation that so much came out on Gardasil killing people so much has come
[2:54:43.100 --> 2:54:49.740]  out on autism that they're now trying this big flu hysteria as a cover for
[2:54:49.740 --> 2:54:53.980]  federal and UN control under level six and that's congressman are saying this
[2:54:53.980 --> 2:54:58.060]  now too exactly I think I think you're right on point I mean you're right on
[2:54:58.060 --> 2:55:03.580]  point it's not even theory anymore it's reality so so really they're playing the
[2:55:03.580 --> 2:55:07.660]  game from 20 years ago but we've you and I and many others awoken folks up the
[2:55:07.660 --> 2:55:11.620]  great listeners out there have and so now I saw him go from saying they had a
[2:55:11.620 --> 2:55:15.460]  hundred and ninety five million doses to 40 million dosages and I'm not saying
[2:55:15.460 --> 2:55:19.140]  we've had victory because they may keep going but it does look like we're seeing
[2:55:19.140 --> 2:55:23.540]  them start to pull back I think there's no question about it you know and so
[2:55:23.540 --> 2:55:29.220]  they they're applying as much care tactic as as possible 90,000 will die
[2:55:29.220 --> 2:55:33.500]  it's possible possible 90,000 will die I don't think it's out of the question you
[2:55:33.500 --> 2:55:40.540]  know um and but but the once again the answer isn't going to be the the you
[2:55:40.540 --> 2:55:44.060]  know it's just like Gardasil let's go back in for a minute is a serious problem
[2:55:44.060 --> 2:55:48.300]  what the problem is that there's no question about it that that promiscuity
[2:55:48.300 --> 2:55:54.380]  among young children among teenagers is the cause of sexual transmitted disease
[2:55:54.380 --> 2:55:58.980]  until we say that out loud it's not gonna stop and all we do is give it
[2:55:58.980 --> 2:56:02.820]  different names before it used to be called just be called syphilis and
[2:56:02.820 --> 2:56:07.500]  gonorrhea then a change to herpes then it became apes and now they're talking
[2:56:07.500 --> 2:56:12.500]  about you know and so all the doings giving fancy names because we're so
[2:56:12.500 --> 2:56:18.020]  politically correct we're not allowed to say if you have sexual relations you
[2:56:18.020 --> 2:56:22.300]  know outside of marriage or I'm not trying to be this you know religious
[2:56:22.300 --> 2:56:25.940]  type person no the point is it's dangerous behavior you're gonna get
[2:56:25.940 --> 2:56:32.060]  burned this is serious serious business and so they give you a vaccine which they
[2:56:32.060 --> 2:56:36.980]  admit on the insert doesn't even protect you from the human papillomavirus all
[2:56:36.980 --> 2:56:41.420]  the hundreds of strains and then it kills a bunch of people and let me tell you
[2:56:41.420 --> 2:56:45.580]  something the my my senior partner dr. Rosie who's been with me for more 25
[2:56:45.580 --> 2:56:50.620]  years calls all these the Gardasil the hepatitis B vaccine the safe sex
[2:56:50.620 --> 2:56:55.260]  vaccine what is the message we're giving we got such great vaccines you can go
[2:56:55.260 --> 2:56:59.060]  and have sex with everyone after you get this vaccine I mean that's the message
[2:56:59.060 --> 2:57:02.380]  you know I mean what a message and all of a sudden people say wait a minute
[2:57:02.380 --> 2:57:06.820]  that's not a very good message and it's no different here than the the blue
[2:57:06.820 --> 2:57:11.700]  vaccine the whole vaccine program you know I think people are wising up and
[2:57:11.700 --> 2:57:15.380]  that's what we're seeing you know what it is it's not as much wising up they're
[2:57:15.380 --> 2:57:20.700]  having the courage to say you know Alex may be right he may not be that crazy
[2:57:20.700 --> 2:57:25.220]  lunatic who's talking about that we need our guns if we need our rights maybe
[2:57:25.220 --> 2:57:30.180]  there is a constitution still you know up you know I this is America and I did
[2:57:30.180 --> 2:57:34.420]  right now is not rolling over to scrape he is saying you know the people will
[2:57:34.420 --> 2:57:37.620]  wake up and they will vote this administration out will that ended
[2:57:37.620 --> 2:57:42.380]  nobody you know what live another day you know and the point is we're in the
[2:57:42.380 --> 2:57:45.660]  fight we're not rolling over to Terry I want to come back and take some phone

[3:00:28.500 --> 3:00:32.080]  with the author of Don't Vaccinate Before You Educate.
[3:00:32.080 --> 3:00:33.560]  Go ahead.
[3:00:33.560 --> 3:00:35.560]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[3:00:35.560 --> 3:00:36.880]  I'm a new listener.
[3:00:36.880 --> 3:00:39.320]  I was a dumb down on the right.
[3:00:39.320 --> 3:00:43.160]  Until you open my eyes, I really appreciate that.
[3:00:43.160 --> 3:00:45.760]  The point I want to make is, yesterday,
[3:00:45.760 --> 3:00:48.920]  as I was listening to you, I'm just
[3:00:48.920 --> 3:00:50.880]  watching Fox News on TV.
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:54.480]  I'm watching the news feeds on the bottom.
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:00:58.440]  And right away, Kathleen Sebelius is on there.
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:04.400]  And the news flashes, 522 die in US from swine flu.
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:05.400]  So that's number one.
[3:01:05.400 --> 3:01:09.000]  Number two, again, today, they did the news flash,
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:12.840]  like the doctor was saying, that 90,000 could die.
[3:01:12.840 --> 3:01:16.760]  Now, also, I'm looking at an article
[3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:21.200]  that was in the LA Times saying hundreds of thousands
[3:01:21.200 --> 3:01:25.280]  could die from swine flu if vaccinations fail.
[3:01:25.280 --> 3:01:27.640]  Now, what I did is I tied all this together
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:31.360]  with the FEMA camps and the coffins.
[3:01:31.360 --> 3:01:33.160]  Those coffins aren't to bury.
[3:01:33.160 --> 3:01:35.960]  They're to get the dead bodies to the FEMA camp,
[3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:38.320]  where they can burn them, because they don't want
[3:01:38.320 --> 3:01:40.520]  any evidence left behind.
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:42.040]  What do you think about that?
[3:01:42.040 --> 3:01:44.200]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned this,
[3:01:44.200 --> 3:01:47.640]  because just a week or two ago, it was 200 deaths.
[3:01:47.640 --> 3:01:49.040]  So, wow, they're saying 500.
[3:01:49.040 --> 3:01:50.640]  I've got to look up that latest number.
[3:01:50.640 --> 3:01:52.720]  The thing is, they continue to put out a bigger number
[3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:55.600]  than revise it, because they'll say everybody
[3:01:55.600 --> 3:01:57.760]  that died of flu died of this, then later it comes back.
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:00.000]  It wasn't that, or in some cases, it was,
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:01.360]  when they didn't know.
[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:04.760]  But Dr. Eisenstein said this may be a really bad flu.
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:06.360]  It may be mutating.
[3:02:06.360 --> 3:02:09.360]  It may kill more than what it regularly does.
[3:02:09.360 --> 3:02:10.880]  But if they almost shut the country down
[3:02:10.880 --> 3:02:12.720]  for a couple deaths in April, what's
[3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:14.480]  going to happen when the regular flu hits
[3:02:14.480 --> 3:02:16.360]  and it kills 30-something thousand?
[3:02:16.360 --> 3:02:19.520]  Dr. Eisenstein comments on what the caller just said.
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:21.840]  You know, you're totally right, you know.
[3:02:21.840 --> 3:02:25.240]  And it goes along with, here's the misinformation.
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:27.880]  This may be serious, here's the answer.
[3:02:27.880 --> 3:02:30.960]  It's the two don't follow from each other, you know,
[3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:37.960]  because the real answers are good hygiene, good nutrition,
[3:02:37.960 --> 3:02:39.960]  and lots of vitamin D.
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:42.160]  Exactly, they're making the solution.
[3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:44.600]  They're saying, all you've gots this vaccine, which
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:47.000]  isn't even the right mutation, and they're saying,
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.960]  right through on the LA Times, if it fails,
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:52.600]  basically 200,000 are dead.
[3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:55.120]  I mean, so, so, so, that's the key.
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:56.080]  You just hit the key there.
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:02:57.320]  I hope people realize that.
[3:02:57.320 --> 3:02:58.920]  I haven't really thought of it that way.
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:01.800]  They're not telling you what all the studies show
[3:03:01.800 --> 3:03:05.760]  about vitamin D, sunshine, plenty of rest,
[3:03:05.760 --> 3:03:08.280]  drinking purified water, eating healthy,
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:11.320]  not being around big crowds of people if this breaks out.
[3:03:11.320 --> 3:03:12.640]  I'm sorry, Doc, go ahead.
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:14.920]  No, no, you're right on point, you know.
[3:03:14.920 --> 3:03:19.920]  And the, this is on the light of just two studies,
[3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:21.680]  not put up by Mayor Eisenstein.
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:23.800]  One was the Archives of Internal Medicine,
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:25.920]  a so-called, quote, prestigious journal,
[3:03:25.920 --> 3:03:29.720]  that 75% of the country is severely deficient vitamin D.
[3:03:29.720 --> 3:03:33.080]  And then there was the one in Pediatrics three months ago,
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:38.840]  which said 75% of children and 100% of Hispanics
[3:03:38.840 --> 3:03:42.120]  and African-Americans are deficient in vitamin D.
[3:03:42.120 --> 3:03:43.120]  Watch who dies.
[3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:45.120]  That sounds awful, I mean, I don't wanna make predictions
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:47.280]  like that, you know, they'll be the ones
[3:03:47.280 --> 3:03:48.640]  who are deficient of vitamin D,
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:50.800]  but the highest probability of dying.
[3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:52.280]  Now, is vitamin D a total answer?
[3:03:52.280 --> 3:03:53.960]  Nothing in life's a total answer.
[3:03:53.960 --> 3:03:55.880]  One day all of us will be with the Lord.
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:03:57.560]  That's the bottom line, you know.
[3:03:57.560 --> 3:03:59.680]  But our goal is to kind of put it off a little bit.
[3:03:59.680 --> 3:04:01.880]  Well, Doc, I mean, I was reading some studies,
[3:04:01.880 --> 3:04:04.120]  but I experienced this myself.
[3:04:04.120 --> 3:04:06.440]  One time in college, living alone,
[3:04:06.440 --> 3:04:08.880]  I barely got to the phone and called my dad to come over
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:10.480]  and get me out of bed and take me to the hospital,
[3:04:10.480 --> 3:04:14.120]  giving me a shot of some type of anti-nautius medicine.
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:18.640]  I forget the name of it, but Phinegrin.
[3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:22.760]  But, but I mean, I couldn't get out of bed for three days.
[3:04:22.760 --> 3:04:24.440]  I was totally dehydrated.
[3:04:24.440 --> 3:04:26.720]  If I'd have been an old person or couldn't got to the phone,
[3:04:26.720 --> 3:04:28.120]  I probably would have ended up dying.
[3:04:28.120 --> 3:04:30.400]  I mean, isn't most of the flu killing people
[3:04:30.400 --> 3:04:31.880]  because they're already sick or debilitated
[3:04:31.880 --> 3:04:35.040]  or they just are alone and end up getting stuck in bed?
[3:04:35.040 --> 3:04:35.880]  Or both.
[3:04:35.880 --> 3:04:37.480]  Well, explain that to us when we get back.
[3:04:37.480 --> 3:04:39.960]  We'll take calls from Pat, Jenny, and Robert.
[3:04:39.960 --> 3:04:42.560]  Final segment with Dr. Mayor Eisenstein.
[3:04:42.560 --> 3:04:46.800]  The book, don't vaccinate before you educate.
[3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:50.440]  Mayor Eisenstein, MD, JD, MPH.
[3:04:50.440 --> 3:04:52.600]  But yeah, I mean, I've had the flu so bad, folks.
[3:04:52.600 --> 3:04:54.600]  I mean, I'm sure a lot of you have had it.
[3:04:54.600 --> 3:04:57.200]  So a lot of this need to help your neighbors.
[3:04:57.200 --> 3:04:59.480]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[3:04:59.480 --> 3:05:01.880]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:05:01.880 --> 3:05:02.880]  this summer.
[3:05:02.880 --> 3:05:06.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:07.280]  or triple your electric bill.
[3:05:07.280 --> 3:05:09.280]  Number two, our new energies are,
[3:05:09.280 --> 3:05:12.080]  wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:12.920]  allows you to have.
[3:05:12.920 --> 3:05:15.680]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[3:05:15.680 --> 3:05:18.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:05:18.080 --> 3:05:20.480]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[3:05:20.480 --> 3:05:22.480]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:05:22.480 --> 3:05:24.560]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:05:24.560 --> 3:05:27.120]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm
[3:05:27.120 --> 3:05:28.240]  season is here again.
[3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:31.120]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power grid
[3:05:31.120 --> 3:05:33.360]  every year, thousands of families lose their power
[3:05:33.360 --> 3:05:34.800]  from weather related outages.
[3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:36.960]  Number five, a solar power generator
[3:05:36.960 --> 3:05:39.520]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:05:39.520 --> 3:05:42.080]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[3:05:42.080 --> 3:05:43.680]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:05:43.680 --> 3:05:45.200]  a longtime sponsor of ours.
[3:05:45.200 --> 3:05:49.920]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[3:05:49.920 --> 3:05:51.680]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[3:05:51.680 --> 3:05:54.240]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[3:05:54.240 --> 3:05:59.680]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[3:05:59.680 --> 3:06:00.880]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:06:00.880 --> 3:06:03.040]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[3:06:03.040 --> 3:06:04.080]  Well, you should.
[3:06:04.080 --> 3:06:07.520]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training
[3:06:07.520 --> 3:06:08.480]  waiting for you.
[3:06:08.480 --> 3:06:09.280]  That's right.
[3:06:09.280 --> 3:06:12.480]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training
[3:06:12.480 --> 3:06:15.280]  at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute
[3:06:15.280 --> 3:06:17.920]  and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit,
[3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:19.280]  all for pennies on the dollar.
[3:06:19.280 --> 3:06:21.680]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot
[3:06:21.680 --> 3:06:25.040]  will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol
[3:06:25.040 --> 3:06:26.560]  in the caliber of your choice.
[3:06:26.560 --> 3:06:28.800]  I believe now is the time that you and your family
[3:06:28.800 --> 3:06:31.040]  need to be armed and trained to levels
[3:06:31.040 --> 3:06:33.920]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[3:06:33.920 --> 3:06:35.520]  Front Sight provides such training
[3:06:35.520 --> 3:06:37.520]  without any boot camp mentality
[3:06:37.520 --> 3:06:39.360]  or drill instructor attitudes.
[3:06:39.360 --> 3:06:40.720]  This is real.
[3:06:40.720 --> 3:06:41.600]  Don't miss out.
[3:06:41.600 --> 3:06:44.720]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course.
[3:06:44.720 --> 3:06:47.760]  Plus, a 30-state concealed weapons permit
[3:06:47.760 --> 3:06:50.320]  for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[3:06:50.320 --> 3:06:52.720]  Go to frontsite.com today.
[3:06:52.720 --> 3:06:56.400]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[3:06:56.400 --> 3:07:00.160]  Go to frontsite.com for your training and free gun.
[3:07:27.360 --> 3:07:29.440]  All this is creating a perfect storm
[3:07:29.440 --> 3:07:31.680]  which could create unimaginable shortages
[3:07:31.680 --> 3:07:33.120]  in the healthcare services.
[3:07:33.120 --> 3:07:35.280]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[3:07:35.280 --> 3:07:37.040]  Our friends at Solutions from Science
[3:07:37.040 --> 3:07:39.760]  have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course
[3:07:39.760 --> 3:07:42.720]  that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines
[3:07:42.720 --> 3:07:44.240]  in the privacy of your own home.
[3:07:44.240 --> 3:07:47.200]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies
[3:07:47.200 --> 3:07:49.440]  and is flat out the best course of its kind.
[3:07:49.440 --> 3:07:51.920]  I recommend you visit this important new website at
[3:07:51.920 --> 3:07:53.600]  makeherbalmedicines.com.
[3:07:53.600 --> 3:07:55.520]  That's makeherbalmedicines.com.
[3:07:55.520 --> 3:07:59.760]  Or call toll-free, 877-327-0365.
[3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:29.120]  I want to go back to your calls.
[3:08:29.120 --> 3:08:33.360]  Bill and Pat and Jenny and I are here in just about 10 seconds.
[3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:36.240]  But I've got to ask this question.
[3:08:36.240 --> 3:08:40.400]  Dr. Eisenstein, we had emergency managers on from Indiana
[3:08:40.400 --> 3:08:41.920]  on the border with Illinois.
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:45.040]  We got internal documents from the state of New York
[3:08:45.040 --> 3:08:49.440]  in January of this year, now eight months ago.
[3:08:49.440 --> 3:08:52.880]  The federal government was preparing police for a flu outbreak,
[3:08:52.880 --> 3:08:57.200]  doing riot drills, telling them harden their police stations,
[3:08:57.200 --> 3:08:58.800]  get ready for mass graves.
[3:08:59.760 --> 3:09:03.120]  And then magically, April, this comes out and they hype it up.
[3:09:03.120 --> 3:09:05.360]  And then now magically, they've got a vaccine.
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:07.440]  And magically, they're saying it's going to kill
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:09.600]  hundreds of thousands if we don't take it.
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:14.240]  I mean, I don't see any way this couldn't be rigged at some level.
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:16.400]  And then a lot of epidemiologists, virologists say
[3:09:16.400 --> 3:09:19.200]  this is clearly a manufactured virus.
[3:09:19.200 --> 3:09:21.440]  Looks like it was made in a laboratory, was altered.
[3:09:21.440 --> 3:09:23.680]  It doesn't really have a pedigree.
[3:09:26.560 --> 3:09:27.600]  Any comments on that?
[3:09:30.720 --> 3:09:32.160]  Yeah, no, I thought about this a lot.
[3:09:32.160 --> 3:09:34.800]  And I think it's 100% true.
[3:09:35.840 --> 3:09:38.640]  But unfortunately, it does make a difference to cast out of the bag.
[3:09:39.760 --> 3:09:43.040]  And be a government manufactured, lab manufacturer,
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:45.200]  pharmaceutical industry manufacturer,
[3:09:45.200 --> 3:09:47.120]  we have a potential serious problem.
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:51.120]  And all the more reason why they're answered.
[3:09:51.120 --> 3:09:53.520]  They thought they had a neat package.
[3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:55.040]  They thought they were going to put something out
[3:09:55.040 --> 3:09:56.400]  and have an answer for it.
[3:09:56.400 --> 3:09:58.160]  That was one theory.
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:02.480]  Or they're going to put something out that didn't work.
[3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:03.920]  But people would get it.
[3:10:03.920 --> 3:10:08.640]  A mild flu, which they would be able to then scare people into pandemic.
[3:10:08.640 --> 3:10:11.200]  Remember, the word pandemic doesn't mean you're going to die.
[3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:12.800]  It means a lot of people are going to get it.
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:15.360]  There's no question in my mind that millions of people
[3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:17.520]  have gotten this swine flu strain.
[3:10:17.520 --> 3:10:19.600]  Very few have died relative.
[3:10:19.600 --> 3:10:23.200]  It's estimated in this country that between 2 and 3 million people
[3:10:23.200 --> 3:10:26.000]  have gotten this swine flu.
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:27.760]  Including in my practice,
[3:10:27.760 --> 3:10:30.240]  I have a feeling we've had at least 100 patients with it.
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:32.960]  Most people don't get tested.
[3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:36.560]  They don't even know if you had it or didn't have it.
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:40.640]  What they didn't count on is that it may actually be problematic.
[3:10:41.840 --> 3:10:43.840]  It didn't count that it may actually kill people.
[3:10:43.840 --> 3:10:46.480]  I mean, they didn't want to kill people.
[3:10:46.480 --> 3:10:47.440]  That's not their goal.
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:51.360]  Killing people doesn't help them sell drugs.
[3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:53.360]  They need the people alive and sick.
[3:10:53.360 --> 3:10:54.640]  That's what helps them sell drugs.
[3:10:54.640 --> 3:10:58.320]  So that's where I see that that wouldn't be their agenda.
[3:10:58.320 --> 3:11:01.600]  What would be their agenda for mass sterilization and eugenics?
[3:11:01.600 --> 3:11:03.200]  They're out of business eventually.
[3:11:03.200 --> 3:11:07.040]  It makes no sense, but it makes a lot of sense to keep people very, very sick.
[3:11:07.040 --> 3:11:12.720]  But in the later phases, they do want the profit phase up front.
[3:11:12.720 --> 3:11:19.520]  But once they've already created a fiat banking system of quadrillions in derivatives,
[3:11:19.520 --> 3:11:22.160]  then they don't need us because it becomes a resource issue.
[3:11:24.160 --> 3:11:29.840]  But I do see your overall point that they do milk the very crises they've created.
[3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:35.440]  That's like the inside word from the big antivirus software virus companies
[3:11:35.440 --> 3:11:37.200]  putting out the viruses themselves.
[3:11:37.760 --> 3:11:38.160]  Let's talk.
[3:11:38.720 --> 3:11:39.120]  Go ahead.
[3:11:39.120 --> 3:11:42.880]  Yeah, 100% right.
[3:11:42.880 --> 3:11:47.440]  Like my adopted son, he's been with us since he's 14 or 15 years old,
[3:11:48.080 --> 3:11:50.720]  genius computer person.
[3:11:50.720 --> 3:11:54.080]  And he said to me back in before 2000, he said,
[3:11:54.080 --> 3:11:58.160]  this whole thing of Y2K, which I forgot about, is all a hoax.
[3:11:58.160 --> 3:12:04.480]  It was all made up by the techies who just wanted to play games with everybody.
[3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:05.840]  And he said, it's the same thing.
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:09.760]  Just what you said, Alex, it's not even a conspiracy theory.
[3:12:09.760 --> 3:12:14.160]  All the viruses are made by the same company that have the antivirus equipment.
[3:12:15.600 --> 3:12:17.040]  Well, it's just amazing.
[3:12:17.040 --> 3:12:19.120]  They certainly capitalize on all of it.
[3:12:19.120 --> 3:12:20.400]  And yeah, big.
[3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:22.720]  The government wanted to use Y2K as the pretext.
[3:12:22.720 --> 3:12:26.800]  They first put the fear out to make everybody convert over to the new systems they
[3:12:26.800 --> 3:12:28.880]  could control in a standardized system.
[3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:31.600]  Pat in Connecticut, you're on the air with Dr. Mayor Eisenstein.
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:32.000]  Go ahead.
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:37.920]  Hi. I actually work at a nursing home here in a small town in Connecticut.
[3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:42.480]  And one thing I'm kind of getting worried about now is that they're going to start
[3:12:42.480 --> 3:12:47.760]  forcing inoculations on us with the swine flu, hepatitis, tuberculosis.
[3:12:48.480 --> 3:12:51.440]  And you have to wonder almost for a second,
[3:12:52.480 --> 3:12:55.520]  why would they be going after the nursing homes if, you know,
[3:12:56.080 --> 3:12:59.920]  most of the people are already sick with, you know, the dimension, everything else?
[3:12:59.920 --> 3:13:04.480]  Because if they can enforce on the nurses and doctors and the enforcers,
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:07.840]  then they'll more happily try to force the citizens to do it.
[3:13:07.840 --> 3:13:10.720]  That's like the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act back in the
[3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:13.280]  2002, 2003.
[3:13:13.280 --> 3:13:15.200]  They tried to make first responders do it.
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:18.640]  In fact, I've got a bigger question for Dr. Eisenstein along that same line.
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:19.200]  Masses.
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:20.400]  In fact, now it's out.
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:22.640]  Half of the UK doctors are saying no.
[3:13:22.640 --> 3:13:24.080]  More than half of New York nurses.
[3:13:24.080 --> 3:13:26.160]  It was 30-something percent last week in New York.
[3:13:26.160 --> 3:13:31.760]  Why, in your opinion, are they trying to force the doctors and nurses to do this first?
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:33.680]  I think you gave the answer.
[3:13:33.680 --> 3:13:38.320]  When you get the first responders to get vaccinated, they're more likely to give it
[3:13:38.320 --> 3:13:39.440]  to someone else.
[3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:46.320]  But when you can't make the first responder take it, and they readily admit they don't take it,
[3:13:47.280 --> 3:13:49.440]  then how are they going to force somebody else?
[3:13:49.440 --> 3:13:53.360]  What happens when, this is a very powerful statement when thousands and thousands of
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:13:56.480]  doctors and nurses say no.
[3:13:56.480 --> 3:13:58.400]  I find this absolutely incredible.
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:02.240]  These aren't doctors and nurses who don't believe in vaccines.
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:05.360]  We don't have that many doctors who don't believe in vaccines.
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:09.120]  So obviously, they've hit a nerve with these people, but they said no.
[3:14:09.680 --> 3:14:10.000]  Yeah.
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:15.200]  Why target the old and then women and children and pregnant women?
[3:14:15.200 --> 3:14:17.440]  When normally they tell pregnant women, don't take any shots.
[3:14:17.440 --> 3:14:18.720]  They just say, yes, take it.
[3:14:19.280 --> 3:14:20.000]  Take it.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:20.960]  Let me tell you something.
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:24.640]  I think this is really sinister.
[3:14:24.640 --> 3:14:25.920]  You give a pregnant woman a shot.
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:31.600]  You've affected her baby, and now you've got that child to give drugs to the rest of that child's life.
[3:14:31.600 --> 3:14:36.960]  It sounds sick, I mean, but can you imagine if you inject now four million pregnant women
[3:14:36.960 --> 3:14:39.600]  in this country, you've just built yourself a great market.
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:42.320]  Oh, I can't think of any other reason.
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:49.280]  The flu shot is called the Category C, contraindicated during pregnancy.
[3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:55.120]  In fact, there was a class action lawsuit filed today with an injunction in Washington, D.C.
[3:14:55.120 --> 3:15:00.960]  to prevent the administration of the flu vaccine to any pregnant woman.
[3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:01.600]  It makes no sense.
[3:15:02.160 --> 3:15:02.720]  Amazing.
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:04.000]  Thank you, Pat.
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:04.720]  Great points.
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:07.760]  Jenny in Texas, Jenny, you're on the air.
[3:15:08.880 --> 3:15:09.520]  Yes, sir.
[3:15:09.520 --> 3:15:16.400]  I have some information, I believe, is important about how many vaccines they are actually
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:24.000]  going to give, and that they're trying to create a false shortage in addition to trying to make
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:24.560]  it sick.
[3:15:25.840 --> 3:15:32.240]  My husband is a police officer, and we live outside of Lubbock, Texas, is about 260,000,
[3:15:32.960 --> 3:15:42.320]  and his supervisor came in from a city meeting with emergency people there, and he said that
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:48.000]  they're only planning to do 40,000 shots, and they're going to do it at our local sports arena.
[3:15:48.640 --> 3:15:53.360]  So it makes me wonder why they're telling us we have to get it, you know, and then say,
[3:15:53.360 --> 3:15:55.280]  well, we're only going to have this many shots.
[3:15:55.280 --> 3:15:57.040]  Well, see, it's all done by color of law.
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:02.880]  They tell police, firemen, nurses, you'll be fired if you don't with no force of law behind it.
[3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:07.680]  And so, again, it's more of an acclamation, more of setting the precedent, and really,
[3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:13.920]  like a federal drill internationally to get everybody lined up and find out and gauge,
[3:16:13.920 --> 3:16:18.720]  they're always testing, they're always probing, and they'll make tens of billions of dollars
[3:16:18.720 --> 3:16:21.680]  off of this, but then practice the federal control.
[3:16:21.680 --> 3:16:25.600]  That's the Fed's excuse to be in there locally bossing people around.
[3:16:25.600 --> 3:16:28.160]  Dr. Eisenstein, your take on what she's saying.
[3:16:28.720 --> 3:16:34.800]  No, I tell you, you know, I think it's what you said earlier, Alex, they're backing off.
[3:16:34.800 --> 3:16:40.800]  They're afraid, you know, they would give 300,000 to all the residents of Lubbock, you know,
[3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:43.600]  Texas, but they have it, it's truly available.
[3:16:43.600 --> 3:16:46.800]  Come on, you know, they got the greatest manufacturing ability in the world.
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:51.760]  They can't produce the stuff, not a chance, you know, but they're afraid that they know it doesn't
[3:16:51.760 --> 3:16:59.680]  work. And so if they're really afraid, there may be a serious swine flu epidemic and people may
[3:16:59.680 --> 3:17:06.320]  die. And what do they do if they gave 250,000 people in Texas there, the swine flu, and 5,000
[3:17:06.320 --> 3:17:11.920]  people die, 100 people, 500, what's their excuse now? And now their excuse is we couldn't vaccinate
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:16.960]  the rest of the groups, so they could vaccinate a small percentage and said we just couldn't
[3:17:16.960 --> 3:17:18.640]  get to everyone in time.
[3:17:18.640 --> 3:17:22.720]  Yeah, I mean, the scientists we talked to said this is clearly engineered.
[3:17:22.720 --> 3:17:27.600]  And so do they know it's an earlier version that's going to mutate into something really deadly?
[3:17:27.600 --> 3:17:33.120]  And then they'll say, see, we told you, you better take the shots and it sets the precedent.
[3:17:33.120 --> 3:17:38.800]  I don't want to declare victory now. It appears on the surface they are pulling back and the
[3:17:38.800 --> 3:17:45.520]  public's waking up, but they've got all sorts of curveballs. I've never seen them gear up for
[3:17:45.520 --> 3:17:53.280]  something this big without it being real at some level. And so I don't want people to get a false
[3:17:53.280 --> 3:17:58.320]  sense of security here, but I do think we're having an effect on them. Anything else, Jenny,
[3:17:58.320 --> 3:18:00.160]  from Lubbock?
[3:18:00.160 --> 3:18:04.080]  No, sir. I just think that confirms what y'all have been talking about.
[3:18:05.360 --> 3:18:09.600]  Well, does your husband say the police are waking up or are they planning to take a shot? I mean,
[3:18:09.600 --> 3:18:13.200]  do they like their commanders telling them they got to take a shot with no authority?
[3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:20.160]  Well, no, we will not. He will not. And his supervisor said me and my family will not.
[3:18:20.160 --> 3:18:25.520]  And my husband, as he says, the infection is spreading, the infection of information.
[3:18:26.800 --> 3:18:31.520]  God bless you and your husband for the work he does. Alex, how exciting is that?
[3:18:31.520 --> 3:18:37.040]  That a supervisor here, someone who's not a hardcore radical, as much like you or I,
[3:18:37.040 --> 3:18:44.240]  is saying, I'm not going to take it. That's just, that's everything. It's the power of one. I've
[3:18:44.240 --> 3:18:50.080]  always believed that. I mean, how strong you are. When someone stands up to you,
[3:18:50.080 --> 3:18:55.520]  and especially Alex, you are right. These are paper tigers. You know, the president and all his
[3:18:55.520 --> 3:19:00.400]  dars, you know, are just paper tigers. You know, they're echoing the missions who've never been
[3:19:00.400 --> 3:19:05.440]  in the real world, never did anything real. And it's really shameful. And the people voted for
[3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:10.480]  them. I pray they're waking up and realize what you've done, you know, and then hopefully do
[3:19:10.480 --> 3:19:12.080]  something different.
[3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:15.520]  Well, they definitely want this to get their socialized healthcare through. And now a lot of
[3:19:15.520 --> 3:19:20.480]  congressmen are saying the White House is staging this hype to get it through. And now the White
[3:19:20.480 --> 3:19:26.320]  House is in the AP today saying, oh, look, healthcare is going to be taxed. We need federal
[3:19:26.320 --> 3:19:36.000]  healthcare. So maybe just the whole drill is the event. Dr. Eisenstein, you said you could
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:40.240]  stay with us, but I don't want to keep twisting your arm. Are you good? I'm okay. I'm good.
[3:19:40.240 --> 3:19:44.480]  All right. 29 after you're gone, we're going to come back, talk to Matt and Ben. That's it.
[3:19:44.480 --> 3:19:51.040]  Then I'm going to get into the new trailer for Burmese's film that's coming out in early February.
[3:19:51.040 --> 3:19:54.960]  And that is going to be, of course, Invisible Empire talking about the New World Order,
[3:19:54.960 --> 3:20:01.280]  this global shadow government, the new trailer for my films up on infowars.com, Paul the Republic.
[3:20:01.280 --> 3:20:06.400]  Alex Jones here with a question. What does humidity mean to you? Most people think of hot and sticky
[3:20:06.400 --> 3:20:11.200]  summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source

[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:04.880]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your
[3:22:04.880 --> 3:22:09.920]  financial affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts,
[3:22:09.920 --> 3:22:14.560]  confiscation of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have
[3:22:14.560 --> 3:22:19.360]  the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug and
[3:22:19.360 --> 3:22:24.960]  Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in
[3:22:24.960 --> 3:22:30.640]  Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government
[3:22:30.640 --> 3:22:35.360]  intervention. For this reason, Mitus Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of
[3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:40.080]  trading precious metals privately. Whether if you have any intention of trading with Mitus Resources

[3:23:01.760 --> 3:23:07.040]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future,
[3:23:07.040 --> 3:23:14.720]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective
[3:23:14.720 --> 3:23:21.520]  be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of
[3:23:21.520 --> 3:23:27.120]  the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:35.520]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:23:35.520 --> 3:23:39.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:23:39.360 --> 3:23:42.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:45.200]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[3:23:45.200 --> 3:24:07.200]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.
[3:24:15.600 --> 3:24:24.800]  All right. Final segment with our guest. Dr. Eisenstein really appreciate his
[3:24:24.800 --> 3:24:29.360]  time. Going to have him back up sooner than two years. Very, very honored to have him with us.
[3:24:29.360 --> 3:24:33.440]  Matt in Louisiana. You are on the air, Matt. Go ahead.
[3:24:34.240 --> 3:24:40.400]  All right. Great. How are you doing, Alex and Dr. Eisenstein? I'm calling them. I'm a big follower
[3:24:40.400 --> 3:24:46.480]  of Dr. Eisenstein and I, I'm not one of these guys calling in to like make the discredit,
[3:24:46.480 --> 3:24:49.840]  the guess or anything. And I've been wanting to know the answer to this question for a long time
[3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:55.440]  since the Chicago Tribune printed it. It was about this $30 million lawsuit that they've given me.
[3:24:55.440 --> 3:25:00.960]  It looks like a smear article, but I just wanted to get Dr. Eisenstein's input or answer to this
[3:25:00.960 --> 3:25:04.800]  for the recall. I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about. I was talking about it.
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:08.880]  It's the tribune did a nice article on me. They put me on the front page of the
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:17.040]  of the Friday edition about four or five months ago. And I could tell you if, if I'll give you
[3:25:17.040 --> 3:25:23.440]  a couple answers to this, they only go after people who cause trouble. And so I'm either a serious
[3:25:23.440 --> 3:25:29.120]  troublemaker or causing trouble for them, you know, and, you know, the, the, the tribune is,
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:35.760]  you know, unfortunately, you know, it's like everything else. They misrepresent the facts.
[3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:40.800]  They change it a little bit. Anyone who delivers babies is involved in lawsuits and we've delivered
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:45.440]  almost 20,000 babies. That's the bottom line. Yeah. Caller, I appreciate your call. But,
[3:25:45.440 --> 3:25:51.200]  but I mean, really, when people are in lawsuits, uh, they're not going to talk about it obviously,
[3:25:51.200 --> 3:25:58.320]  because you're not supposed to. You know, but, but that's, but that's, but for people that don't
[3:25:58.320 --> 3:26:04.880]  know, dentist, oral surgeons, doctors, they all get sued. Crazy people come in and come after you.
[3:26:04.880 --> 3:26:08.560]  That's why we've got a doctor shortage in this country because we've cut their pay in half
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:12.800]  since the seventies and we treat them like crap. And they're busy filling out government forms
[3:26:12.800 --> 3:26:18.080]  all day instead of helping people. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, no, that, that, that's exactly
[3:26:18.080 --> 3:26:22.720]  it. I mean, you know, I, if a doctor tells me he's ever had a lawsuit, that means he's not doing
[3:26:22.720 --> 3:26:28.000]  anything of, of, of consequence in the sense, you know, uh, absolutely. That's just ridiculous.
[3:26:28.800 --> 3:26:31.920]  Let's go ahead. I'm not mad at you, Matt, but I mean, give me a break. We're here talking about
[3:26:31.920 --> 3:26:36.560]  vaccines, not some lawsuit over a baby being delivered at home. I mean, that's why they're
[3:26:37.280 --> 3:26:43.120]  half the women are having cesareans. I've got articles where they CPS women who refuse cesareans
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:48.320]  even when the baby isn't in trouble. I mean, that's a whole nother subject. They want to make it all
[3:26:48.320 --> 3:26:54.080]  medicalized. We're a hundred years from now. It's a conspiracy theory that women ever had babies
[3:26:54.080 --> 3:26:59.760]  vaginally. No, women used to have them vaginally. Women used to feed their babies with their memory
[3:26:59.760 --> 3:27:05.680]  glands. It's not a conspiracy theory. Dr. Eisenstein comments on that. Well, that's exactly right.
[3:27:05.680 --> 3:27:11.120]  The incidence of breastfeeding in this country is virtually zero, virtually zero. How, how absolutely
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:17.440]  nauseating, but when, you know, um, uh, you said it real well, breast are meant to feed babies.
[3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:23.920]  You know, the best quote I ever heard of that is the, the two hemispheres of the brain of the most
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:30.720]  brilliant scientist isn't a fraction as brilliant at compounding a formula for a baby that the two
[3:27:30.720 --> 3:27:36.880]  mammograms can cleanse of any woman. They're not going to look at either. Let's go ahead and take
[3:27:36.880 --> 3:27:42.640]  a final call. Ben in Oregon. Ben, you're on the air. Yeah, I was calling because I have a five and a
[3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:50.240]  half month old baby and we've gotten, I've gotten not all the shots, but my wife is convinced that
[3:27:50.240 --> 3:27:54.800]  we got to get the penta cell shot and we've done two doses of it and I just wanted to see if you
[3:27:54.800 --> 3:27:59.840]  guys have any good ideas or anything. What shot was that? What? I didn't hear what the shot was that
[3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:07.440]  you gave. Penta cell? Penta cell. It's like a mixture of like, of a whooping cough and like,
[3:28:07.440 --> 3:28:12.160]  all the mixtures. I mean, you know, I mean, look, I thought I was taught in medical school years
[3:28:12.160 --> 3:28:18.400]  ago. You don't give combination drugs and vaccines are drugs. They said, you don't give an aspirin
[3:28:18.400 --> 3:28:24.080]  and a, and a Tylenol or, or, or, or, you know, these combination. Let me interrupt. Just give
[3:28:24.080 --> 3:28:28.640]  your wife this, how the Japanese don't let you vaccinate till two and they say give it a single
[3:28:28.640 --> 3:28:34.480]  shot. It's correct, doctor. Absolutely correct. So I mean, you want to give all that, you know,
[3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:37.760]  give them one of the time if that's what you're going to do and then watch what happens to them
[3:28:37.760 --> 3:28:42.080]  and space it out. That's like, and I'm not practicing medicine. That's what other doctors have said
[3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:47.680]  here. Take the MMR, take all these multiple jabs and the type you're talking about must be the
[3:28:47.680 --> 3:28:53.120]  drug company name. Those are some of the worst associated with bad effects. Correct, doctor?
[3:28:53.120 --> 3:28:58.800]  Exactly right. Exactly right. I mean, the idea of, of combining different drugs into one,
[3:28:58.800 --> 3:29:07.520]  you know, you know, someone says very well about these multiple vaccines, multiple virus strains
[3:29:07.520 --> 3:29:13.920]  in one vaccine. If you, it's not one injection. If you go to the bar and you order five shots
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:19.120]  of whiskey and they put it into one glass, have you gotten just one glass of whiskey or one,
[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:24.320]  one shot? No, it's five shots, you know. Yeah, caller, thank you. Dr. Eisenstein,
[3:29:24.320 --> 3:29:30.560]  amazing hour and 20 minute interview. Don't vaccinate before you educate available at infowars.com.

[3:29:38.880 --> 3:29:44.080]  site. Dr. always great having you on. Oh, it's my pleasure. Thank you so much, Alex. God bless.
[3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:47.120]  Have a wonderful day. God bless you. Get back to your practice. Take care. Thank you. Be well.
[3:29:47.120 --> 3:29:54.560]  Medical doctor and lawyer. We'll be right back. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.440 --> 3:30:04.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:30:04.560 --> 3:30:09.360]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you
[3:30:09.360 --> 3:30:15.200]  want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:30:15.200 --> 3:30:19.280]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:30:19.280 --> 3:30:24.400]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:30:24.400 --> 3:30:29.280]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[3:30:29.280 --> 3:30:34.320]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[3:30:34.320 --> 3:30:39.920]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:30:39.920 --> 3:30:45.120]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:30:45.120 --> 3:30:53.120]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out
[3:30:53.120 --> 3:30:59.680]  on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:30:59.680 --> 3:31:05.840]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:31:05.840 --> 3:31:10.400]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[3:31:10.400 --> 3:31:15.520]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[3:31:15.520 --> 3:31:19.840]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products

[3:32:04.720 --> 3:32:09.520]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you
[3:32:09.520 --> 3:32:15.360]  want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:32:15.360 --> 3:32:20.720]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[3:32:20.720 --> 3:32:25.440]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any
[3:32:25.440 --> 3:32:30.320]  food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you
[3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:35.280]  go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good
[3:32:35.280 --> 3:32:41.360]  food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need?
[3:32:41.360 --> 3:32:46.800]  We don't know. How much do you want all you can get? I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys
[3:32:46.800 --> 3:32:55.920]  to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:32:55.920 --> 3:33:11.840]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:33:11.840 --> 3:33:25.280]  My new film, really cartoon to the Obama Deception, titled Fall of the Republic,
[3:33:26.560 --> 3:33:32.800]  is due out October 21st, 2009, about two months from now. The film is nearing completion in the
[3:33:32.800 --> 3:33:37.760]  next three weeks or so. You can watch the first trailer for the documentary. There'll be more
[3:33:37.760 --> 3:33:44.960]  trailers and sneak peeks in the months to come up at infowars.com right now. Again, it's up on
[3:33:44.960 --> 3:33:51.040]  infowars.com. We have a detailed article written by Paul Watson detailing what the documentary
[3:33:51.040 --> 3:33:56.400]  covers. It shows how the globalist, this private offshore group of banks, are engaged in a global
[3:33:56.400 --> 3:34:02.480]  corporate takeover of the planet, destroying nation states by manufacturing debt bubbles that
[3:34:02.480 --> 3:34:07.200]  are impossible to escape through fraud. You've got to denounce the bankers, denounce the debt,
[3:34:07.200 --> 3:34:12.880]  arrest the bankers for their crimes. They're a bunch of made-off type characters. It's fraudulent,
[3:34:12.880 --> 3:34:17.760]  and this has got to be done. And that's what Fall of the Republic covers, is the banking system,
[3:34:17.760 --> 3:34:24.080]  their overall agenda, the global greenhouse gas taxes. It's all covered in the documentary film
[3:34:24.080 --> 3:34:30.400]  Fall of the Republic. And so I just want to challenge everybody out there to get this article
[3:34:30.400 --> 3:34:35.520]  that Paul Watson's written on infowars.com and prisonplot.com and to virally get it out to
[3:34:35.520 --> 3:34:42.320]  everybody. This film will be a giant success if you make it a success. The Obama deception
[3:34:42.320 --> 3:34:49.440]  has been seen more than 20 million times free online. More than 8 million times alone, the
[3:34:49.440 --> 3:34:56.160]  different versions. One of them's got 3.3 million on YouTube alone. The film will be free,
[3:34:57.280 --> 3:35:01.520]  but I cannot continue to make films that people don't buy the DVD. So it'll go on sale
[3:35:01.520 --> 3:35:05.760]  a few weeks before it's released. I want everybody to order the DVD, have the high-quality DVD and
[3:35:05.760 --> 3:35:10.160]  extras in their possession, but also get the free versions that will be around the web.
[3:35:10.160 --> 3:35:14.640]  It'll be there for prisonplanet.tv members in the highest quality. We're going to try to have this
[3:35:14.640 --> 3:35:24.240]  in true HD this time, not just in really high res for the great folks that are prisonplanet.tv
[3:35:24.240 --> 3:35:30.240]  members. If you're not a prisonplanet.tv member, be sure and take advantage of that today. So
[3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:39.920]  that's the bottom line. Now, I do want to go ahead and we have Burmese's trailer ready
[3:35:39.920 --> 3:35:43.520]  for the premiere here of this. It just so happened we didn't coordinate this that
[3:35:43.520 --> 3:35:47.120]  on the same day we're releasing both our trailers. Jason Burmese making a film under
[3:35:47.120 --> 3:35:51.200]  the Infowars label here in our new larger Central Texas Command Center where we can
[3:35:51.200 --> 3:35:55.520]  accommodate getting a few more filmmakers in here. He's been researching this film for years.
[3:35:56.080 --> 3:35:59.760]  He's been going through national archive footage traveling all over the country.
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:05.840]  He's got George Bush, New Order clips and clips of Richard Nixon calling for world government
[3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:09.760]  and others that nobody's got. I mean, this film is going to be amazing getting into
[3:36:09.760 --> 3:36:14.480]  how their global government works, how it administers and what their overall program is.
[3:36:14.480 --> 3:36:18.880]  It's invisible empire and he wanted to have it out in December and I said, Burmese, take your time.
[3:36:18.880 --> 3:36:24.320]  This is important film. He's going to release it in early February. That's why it says on the trailer
[3:36:24.320 --> 3:36:32.400]  winner of OTAN, but that's only four months away. So here, ladies and gentlemen, never before seen.
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:36.240]  This isn't up on YouTube yet. It's going up on the Alex Jones channel in the next few hours.
[3:36:36.800 --> 3:36:42.320]  This is the opening kind of avant-garde. It's different from the trailers we make. I think
[3:36:42.320 --> 3:36:51.200]  it's a good trailer. Long form, four minute trailer for the new film, Invisible Empire.
[3:36:51.200 --> 3:36:57.760]  And that's what the new order really calls their system. So I want to say great job to Mike here
[3:36:57.760 --> 3:37:21.840]  in the office working on this. And of course, Jason Burmese. So here it is.
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:35.840]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[3:37:37.440 --> 3:37:41.600]  And the hope that each of us has to build a new world order.
[3:37:42.480 --> 3:37:47.120]  A new world order is coming into being, but it looks less and less like the world order that
[3:37:47.120 --> 3:37:54.880]  Mr. Kissinger had constructed in his own mind. And we are as a people inherently and historically
[3:37:54.880 --> 3:38:00.400]  opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:04.880]  What is the Bohemian Grove? Well, it's a kind of summer camp for the powerful.
[3:38:05.600 --> 3:38:10.480]  Among its members, political figures like Gerald Ford, President Reagan, Vice President Bush,
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:16.320]  Richard Nixon is a Bohemian. Each year, guests like Henry Kissinger or Spignu Brzezinski address
[3:38:16.320 --> 3:38:22.400]  members on their areas of expertise. To be opposed to child for these people because you have served
[3:38:22.400 --> 3:38:26.880]  on the board of the Council on Foreign Relations, you started, helped start the Trilateral Commission
[3:38:26.880 --> 3:38:33.520]  and you've been to the Bilderberger groups. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic
[3:38:33.520 --> 3:38:40.080]  and ruthless conspiracy. I don't believe in this notion of some sort of secret societies
[3:38:40.080 --> 3:38:47.920]  controlling people. But of course, in any political system, there are sort of over the table and
[3:38:47.920 --> 3:38:55.040]  under the table arrangements. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material
[3:38:55.040 --> 3:39:02.560]  resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine by the military industrial
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:10.000]  complex. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined.
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:18.720]  Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. We can find meaning and reward by serving
[3:39:19.280 --> 3:39:26.560]  some higher purpose than ourselves. A shining purpose, the illumination of a thousand points
[3:39:26.560 --> 3:39:33.360]  of light. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.
[3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:40.720]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world
[3:39:40.720 --> 3:39:48.720]  order. The quest for the new world order is in part a challenge to keep the dangers of disorder
[3:39:48.720 --> 3:39:54.000]  at bay. We were interested today to hear that more than a hundred law enforcement officials in
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:59.040]  Mexico are having microchips implanted in their arms. The chips allow a person to be scanned
[3:39:59.040 --> 3:40:03.600]  sort of like a cereal box at the supermarket, check out. I think the most important thing is for
[3:40:03.600 --> 3:40:11.760]  Barack Obama. I think its task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:17.680]  when really a new world order can be created. I think the new world order is emerging and with
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:24.800]  it the foundations of a new and progressive era of international cooperation. But the burdens of
[3:40:24.800 --> 3:40:32.800]  global citizenship continue to bind us together. In this new century Americans and Europeans alike
[3:40:32.800 --> 3:40:40.800]  will be required to do more, not less. Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice.
[3:40:40.800 --> 3:40:54.800]  Yes these men and their hypnotized followers, call this a new order. It is not new and it is not order.
[3:40:54.800 --> 3:41:16.800]  I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people.
[3:41:16.800 --> 3:41:27.280]  Good music too huh. That is myself singing as a choral orchestra. Okay great job to Jason Burmese
[3:41:27.280 --> 3:41:30.880]  and Mike. I plug Mike's last name but I haven't asked him if he wants to be known.
[3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:37.120]  Video graphics guy here in the office. Again Burmese has been working on the film for really
[3:41:37.120 --> 3:41:45.520]  the last year. Years of research but working here often on the last year. That is just a graphics
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:51.840]  trailer right there but really interesting film and I told you the mission here with moving into
[3:41:51.840 --> 3:41:56.800]  bigger offices is to do more media, more films, expand what we are doing because everything
[3:41:56.800 --> 3:42:03.280]  we are doing is having a great effect. It is reaching out to people and it is warning people
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:10.480]  and it is proving to people that what we are saying is true and that is what both Invisible
[3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:16.320]  Empire and Fall of the Republic see for the global empire to really be set up they need all the
[3:42:16.320 --> 3:42:21.920]  nation states to fall and people argue well world government is just the next phase in society.
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:28.640]  Well whether you are for global government or not which I am not. Anything command and
[3:42:28.640 --> 3:42:34.000]  control and centralized always goes bad very very quickly. Whether you are for that or not.
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:46.160]  The issue is this is a tyrannical undemocratic system in the words of the elite themselves
[3:42:47.040 --> 3:42:50.480]  and that is actually what Invisible Empire is covering and we also cover that.
[3:42:50.480 --> 3:42:55.600]  It is the only issue that needs to be covered. Everything else is under that umbrella. It
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:43:01.360]  also is covered in Fall of the Republic and we are getting rave reviews for the trailer for Fall
[3:43:01.360 --> 3:43:05.760]  of the Republic. I am told in the next 30 minutes or so the little blurb article Burmese wrote and
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:11.280]  his trailer will be up on the Alex Jones channel at YouTube and up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[3:43:11.280 --> 3:43:16.400]  and again we are counting on all of you to get this out to everyone because here we are making
[3:43:16.400 --> 3:43:21.760]  these expensive hard for us to make blood, sweat and tears films and saying here they are for free
[3:43:22.800 --> 3:43:28.320]  and really that is not something that we need to be praised for. We are trying to survive,
[3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:32.320]  we are trying to defeat the globalist. When you realize this is life and death, when you realize
[3:43:32.320 --> 3:43:36.960]  this is real, when you realize they are drugging your water and food, when you realize that they
[3:43:36.960 --> 3:43:44.640]  are eugenicists, when you realize the score, I mean I would expect people to want to beat me up
[3:43:44.640 --> 3:43:49.680]  if I wasn't making films and putting them out for free. I would expect people to, I mean what am
[3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:57.120]  I a crazy person? I mean how do you know about this stuff and then not do everything you can
[3:43:57.120 --> 3:44:02.480]  to warn people if you don't love your family? I'm not some jackass who can sit here and
[3:44:02.480 --> 3:44:08.000]  rationalize reality and go oh that's not real, oh that's not true, the Gardasil vaccine didn't
[3:44:08.000 --> 3:44:16.480]  kill in people, the flu shot didn't kill in people, when it is. I'm about reality, I told
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:20.480]  you they were going to say and so did Chapman, people have now pulled those clips that he was
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:25.440]  going to try to stage his death via cancer and now that's floating around the media, I mean
[3:44:25.440 --> 3:44:30.880]  they're just trial ballooning this stuff on folks and it's not that I'm even smart, the globalist
[3:44:30.880 --> 3:44:38.320]  are pathological, once you know their criminology, once you know their MO, it's just different
[3:44:38.320 --> 3:44:47.680]  permutations of the same action. It's like a guy who likes brunettes who are well endowed and
[3:44:48.640 --> 3:44:54.240]  he's going to go after people that are brunette, that are well and it's like somebody who likes
[3:44:54.240 --> 3:44:59.280]  blondes is going to go after blondes, you know well the New World Order, we know their pathology,
[3:44:59.280 --> 3:45:04.800]  they build FEMA camps, they put up cameras, they put people in camps, they militarize the police,
[3:45:04.800 --> 3:45:10.960]  they drug the water and food, they use medicine as a tool of tyranny, see pathology is how someone
[3:45:10.960 --> 3:45:15.920]  behaves, I come on the radio and yell and scream and rant and rave, that's my pathology.
[3:45:15.920 --> 3:45:24.480]  The globalist have a modus operandi, they have a way of doing things
[3:45:25.680 --> 3:45:32.640]  and I study them, I do the same thing every day when it comes time to plug sponsors and
[3:45:32.640 --> 3:45:40.080]  then hit some final news and calls, I can't find the sheet I had in here for, oh there it is,
[3:45:40.880 --> 3:45:44.240]  I got to clean this desk off, the guys have done a good job trying to organize it,
[3:45:44.240 --> 3:45:47.680]  believe it or not this is like a week and a half of news and there's probably,
[3:45:49.680 --> 3:45:54.960]  I bet if you counted this I bet there's 857 articles, you guys want to wager to bet,
[3:45:54.960 --> 3:46:01.120]  I bet I'm closer, it's like the price is right, I bet there are 857 articles, I bet I'm closest
[3:46:01.120 --> 3:46:07.920]  to that, I bet there's 857 articles here in front of me right now on PrismPlanet.tv.
[3:46:07.920 --> 3:46:17.360]  I bet that's how many things there are on this desk because I've learned what a stack is,
[3:46:17.360 --> 3:46:20.880]  this stack right here, this stack is probably about,
[3:46:23.440 --> 3:46:31.360]  probably about 104 articles, maybe 95, I don't know, you got all this, it's just every one of
[3:46:31.360 --> 3:46:35.840]  these things totally proves what we're saying, I mean it's like in the stack we've got black
[3:46:35.840 --> 3:46:44.080]  water running around murdering political enemies, we've got fake terror alerts being put out admitted,
[3:46:44.080 --> 3:46:48.560]  we've got Obama now confirming what we knew saying they were going to come out and say we
[3:46:48.560 --> 3:46:52.880]  got to have socialized medicine, government health care because of the swine flu, I mean it's just
[3:46:52.880 --> 3:46:59.440]  like, it's like watching a cuckoo clock and you go, when it goes to six o'clock the little cuckoo

[3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:18.800]  would like to say the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for
[3:52:18.800 --> 3:52:24.320]  the best interest of the american people while obama's already fudging yeah fudge since day one
[3:52:24.320 --> 3:52:29.440]  in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultures

[3:54:36.560 --> 3:54:53.380]  He's going to sell you a line, make you love it, but you can only do this trick so long.
[3:54:53.380 --> 3:54:57.960]  People figured out Obama is a complete fraud, approval rating now dropped down to 41 points
[3:54:57.960 --> 3:54:58.960]  and going downward.
[3:54:58.960 --> 3:55:00.460]  That was a couple days ago.
[3:55:00.460 --> 3:55:02.840]  Let's look at the Rasmussen daily track.
[3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:08.840]  I bet if I bet if Saturday's tracker poll had him at 41, it must be like 40 right now.
[3:55:08.840 --> 3:55:14.000]  I mean, man, they're going to have to stage something big.
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:18.000]  In fact, all these polls are coming in Las Vegas Review Journal shows Senate campaign
[3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:24.000]  poll shows potential GOP challengers would beat Harry Reid.
[3:55:24.000 --> 3:55:27.760]  There's also evidence showing that Rand Paul is going to win.
[3:55:27.760 --> 3:55:29.320]  Peter Schiff could win.
[3:55:29.320 --> 3:55:34.120]  I mean, on every front, but let's make sure it's good Republicans or good Democrats that
[3:55:34.120 --> 3:55:38.480]  replace these people, not more New World Order people.
[3:55:38.480 --> 3:55:41.880]  So that's an exciting little tidbit.
[3:55:41.880 --> 3:55:49.640]  Also Analyst Bo sees 150 to 200 more US bank failures.
[3:55:49.640 --> 3:55:54.360]  They've had a bunch of big banks go up in the last two weeks, as I know most of you know,
[3:55:54.360 --> 3:55:55.360]  and it's only deepening.
[3:55:55.360 --> 3:55:59.600]  I mean, all this fiat money that they've put us in debt is only the big central banks.
[3:55:59.600 --> 3:56:01.240]  They're the only ones that have money.
[3:56:01.240 --> 3:56:06.360]  All the other banks and regional systems are in deep trouble.
[3:56:06.360 --> 3:56:10.840]  Look at Bush saying, don't have the media Bush, excuse me, Freudian slip.
[3:56:10.840 --> 3:56:11.840]  I hate them both.
[3:56:11.840 --> 3:56:18.760]  Obama, the puppet saying, don't photograph his daughters, but the police state he supports.
[3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:19.760]  So what is it now?
[3:56:19.760 --> 3:56:24.080]  There you are on Rasmussen.
[3:56:24.080 --> 3:56:30.920]  It'll, uh, it'll show on there the total number.
[3:56:30.920 --> 3:56:31.920]  I don't know.
[3:56:31.920 --> 3:56:40.480]  It shows it shows it's the same then, interesting, lowest ever that we've ever seen.
[3:56:40.480 --> 3:56:44.680]  Again, I'm going to talk more in the days to come.
[3:56:44.680 --> 3:56:50.680]  We've got it up on the websites about Bernanke, all the unpopularity, all the criminality,
[3:56:50.680 --> 3:56:57.120]  all the insider trading, all the manipulations, the conflict of interest.
[3:56:57.120 --> 3:57:00.600]  And there's Obama today saying how great Bernanke is.
[3:57:00.600 --> 3:57:07.680]  And Bernanke looked like just a pile of, well, I'm not going to say it.
[3:57:07.680 --> 3:57:17.120]  He just, the video I saw today of him live, it was just absolutely disgusting to see him
[3:57:17.120 --> 3:57:28.640]  up there and now they are saying that they need another bailout and that, oh, the deficit
[3:57:28.640 --> 3:57:32.700]  was bigger than Obama thought when he got into office eight months ago and then he wasn't
[3:57:32.700 --> 3:57:33.700]  going to cut it in half.
[3:57:33.700 --> 3:57:34.840]  In fact, it's going to get bigger.
[3:57:34.840 --> 3:57:35.840]  It's all lies.
[3:57:35.840 --> 3:57:41.960]  And then they stole you with another lie, another fraud, another scam over and over and
[3:57:41.960 --> 3:57:42.960]  over again.
[3:57:42.960 --> 3:57:47.360]  I just can't believe the White House is saying they're going to openly continue secret arrest
[3:57:47.360 --> 3:57:52.880]  renditions with indefinite detention and this is held as liberal because as long as it's
[3:57:52.880 --> 3:57:56.680]  a Democrat doing it, it's okay.
[3:57:56.680 --> 3:57:57.680]  It's all about ego.
[3:57:57.680 --> 3:58:02.680]  Just like Republicans got mad at Clinton because they weren't in power, then Bush came in and
[3:58:02.680 --> 3:58:04.440]  expanded what Clinton was doing.
[3:58:04.440 --> 3:58:05.560]  They suddenly loved it.
[3:58:05.560 --> 3:58:06.680]  It's pathetic.
[3:58:06.680 --> 3:58:12.080]  Get out of your partisanship unless you want to end up hoppers on the continent your forefathers
[3:58:12.080 --> 3:58:15.320]  conquered.
[3:58:15.320 --> 3:58:17.960]  Also I meant to play it today.
[3:58:17.960 --> 3:58:20.680]  They will play it tomorrow at the start of the show or something.
[3:58:20.680 --> 3:58:23.680]  We've put up part of the interview I did with Jesse Ventura when I was out in California
[3:58:23.680 --> 3:58:24.680]  last week.
[3:58:24.680 --> 3:58:28.360]  I'm back out there later in the week for more episodes, but that great interview is up on
[3:58:28.360 --> 3:58:29.360]  Info Wars as well.
[3:58:29.360 --> 3:58:33.080]  We have the new general poster revolution contest.
[3:58:33.080 --> 3:58:36.600]  We can make any poster you want, put them up and you can win the $1,000 prize.
[3:58:36.600 --> 3:58:38.400]  It will announce in a week and a half.
[3:58:38.400 --> 3:58:39.400]  Great job, crew.
[3:58:39.400 --> 3:58:43.400]  Transmission starts now.
[3:58:43.400 --> 3:58:46.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:46.400 --> 3:58:51.240]  Visit GCN Live.com today.
[3:58:51.240 --> 3:58:55.160]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:58:55.160 --> 3:58:57.440]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:58:57.440 --> 3:59:03.080]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[3:59:03.080 --> 3:59:06.080]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:59:06.080 --> 3:59:10.200]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental
[3:59:10.200 --> 3:59:11.200]  system diseases.
[3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:13.360]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:59:13.360 --> 3:59:18.120]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[3:59:18.120 --> 3:59:19.880]  you and your family's drinking water.
[3:59:19.880 --> 3:59:24.640]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[3:59:24.640 --> 3:59:30.000]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization
[3:59:30.000 --> 3:59:31.000]  techniques.
[3:59:31.000 --> 3:59:34.400]  That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe.
