[00:00.000 --> 00:08.800]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.800 --> 00:14.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14.000 --> 00:27.480]  We're live, it is Sunday, the 9th day of January, 2011, we're going to be here for the next
[00:27.480 --> 00:35.480]  two hours, Jim Mars, historian, researcher, professor, best-selling author, will be joining
[00:35.480 --> 00:41.960]  us live because he's a real expert when it comes to confirmed evidence of Manchurian
[00:41.960 --> 00:51.600]  candidate type activity with Sirhan Sirhan, Mark David Chapman, John Hinckley Jr., and
[00:51.600 --> 00:52.600]  many others.
[00:52.600 --> 00:58.560]  In fact, I read books he wrote 15 years ago or more breaking down Sirhan Sirhan and Robert
[00:58.560 --> 01:07.880]  Kennedy and that whole situation and years later, in 2005, 2008, mainstream news like
[01:07.880 --> 01:13.140]  London Independent, London Guardian, even Reuters here in the United States, reporting
[01:13.140 --> 01:17.200]  on the fact that they'd done the acoustic checks and the bullet checks and that Sirhan
[01:17.200 --> 01:21.240]  Sirhan wasn't the guy that shot Robert F. Kennedy, that's what the police and others
[01:21.240 --> 01:25.360]  said at the time and that he was just there firing wildly and then while his hand was
[01:25.360 --> 01:31.120]  pinned down, shots were still being fired and we even now know the CIA agent who was
[01:31.120 --> 01:35.440]  there firing the shots from behind Sirhan Sirhan and obviously the reason we're going
[01:35.440 --> 01:40.600]  to be covering this coming up in 45 minutes is because of the unfolding situation that
[01:40.600 --> 01:50.160]  happened yesterday morning at a grocery store there in Arizona in Tucson, Jared Lee Loeffner,
[01:50.160 --> 01:58.000]  they've always got three names, don't they, poets and assassins, Jared Lee Loeffner and
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.280]  there's a dead federal judge, he shot the Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords into the
[02:03.280 --> 02:06.600]  brain but she reportedly is alive and responsive.
[02:06.600 --> 02:11.160]  The brain's amazing, they've had cases in mining explosions where a crowbar is all the
[02:11.160 --> 02:15.560]  way through someone's head and it's removed and they're fine or they've had cases where
[02:15.560 --> 02:22.800]  somebody gets punched in the temple, whitely, and they fall over dead so we hope for her
[02:22.800 --> 02:29.160]  the best and I've seen some people out there on the web saying, oh, too bad that he didn't
[02:29.160 --> 02:31.160]  get all the Congress.
[02:31.160 --> 02:36.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental problem in this country and worldwide is us individually.
[02:36.040 --> 02:43.680]  Sure, the Supreme Court legalized abortion back in 1973 and we've had 51 million babies
[02:43.680 --> 02:48.120]  since then but what's wrong with us as a country that we haven't educated people that this
[02:48.120 --> 02:52.960]  is barbaric and wrong, Congress has gotten out of control because we've let them get
[02:52.960 --> 02:59.720]  out of control and if more of this happens the system is going to use this to push a
[02:59.720 --> 03:03.880]  crack down on the population and that's going to explode even bigger and cause more dead
[03:03.880 --> 03:11.080]  people on both sides and statistically leans towards the globalist favor if we get violent.
[03:11.080 --> 03:18.120]  I don't want violence, I want to have a peaceful restoration of our republic and this guy hooked
[03:18.120 --> 03:24.240]  in with a white supremacist, very creepy, fed run gaggle of individuals and that adds
[03:24.240 --> 03:30.280]  towards the weight on one side that this was a federal mind control operation which are
[03:30.280 --> 03:31.280]  very real.
[03:31.280 --> 03:38.200]  I mean, those are admitted in 1977 Congressional hearings to be one of the biggest covert,
[03:38.200 --> 03:46.400]  not just CIA but defense intelligence, overall Pentagon, private university, operations ever.
[03:46.400 --> 03:52.600]  I mean, they are obsessed with mind control, erasing memories, creating kind of wind up
[03:52.600 --> 03:58.520]  toy people who have their memory erased but have a total compulsion and that's what Jared
[03:58.520 --> 04:04.040]  Lee Loftner on his Myspace and Facebook and all these places said, I can't rest, I've
[04:04.040 --> 04:11.240]  got to do this, I've got a compulsion, sorry, now that also mirrors what a regular out of
[04:11.240 --> 04:15.920]  their mind violent schizophrenic, paranoid schizophrenic would do because they artificially
[04:15.920 --> 04:22.240]  create an artificial paranoid schizophrenia and then they point it and direct the compulsion
[04:22.240 --> 04:26.760]  that everything's going to be alright and they're going to be in a heaven, Mount Olympus,
[04:26.760 --> 04:39.040]  Cala, Nirvana, great consciousness expanding moment when they kill their subject but it's
[04:39.040 --> 04:43.800]  hard to tell if it was a mind control operation or not because both mirror each other but
[04:43.800 --> 04:47.680]  it's got the telltale cookie cutter signs there, we'll be breaking it all down, we
[04:47.680 --> 04:51.520]  come back on the other side of this quick break, Jim Maher's coming up in about 40 minutes,
[04:51.520 --> 04:55.160]  I'm Alex Jones, the Drudge Report is linked to one of our key articles, we'll cover that
[04:55.160 --> 04:57.360]  when we come back.
[04:57.360 --> 05:05.080]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[05:05.080 --> 05:09.920]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[05:09.920 --> 05:13.920]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[05:13.920 --> 05:18.520]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[05:18.520 --> 05:23.800]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver
[05:23.800 --> 05:30.080]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[05:30.080 --> 05:34.400]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now
[05:34.400 --> 05:39.720]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[05:39.720 --> 05:44.960]  Very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[05:44.960 --> 05:51.240]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[05:51.240 --> 06:00.360]  Lungs Generator, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[06:00.360 --> 06:06.280]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[06:06.280 --> 06:14.600]  a war on for your mind.
[06:14.600 --> 06:19.040]  We are live ladies and gentlemen, we'll be here for the next two hours, it is the ninth
[06:19.040 --> 06:24.160]  day of January 2011 on this Sunday edition.
[06:24.160 --> 06:32.000]  We have former Fort Worth Star Telegram crime reporter, professor, bestselling author, researcher,
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.160]  he wrote the book that was of course then turned into Oliver Stone's film JFK.
[06:38.160 --> 06:44.880]  Jim Mars joining us in about T-minus 40 minutes, he will be joining us from the DFW area.
[06:44.880 --> 06:51.320]  He is an expert on political assassination, both where they just have patsies and have
[06:51.320 --> 06:58.560]  somebody they set up and blame for the shooting, a James Earl Ray, a Lee Harvey Oswald or a
[06:58.560 --> 07:04.000]  Tim McVeigh type operation where they blame the operation on one of their throwaway puppets,
[07:04.000 --> 07:11.120]  but he's also an expert on confirmed instances and the congressional reports of 1977 on MK
[07:11.120 --> 07:15.360]  Ultra, MK Naomi, mind control.
[07:15.360 --> 07:21.000]  Now I don't know if this Jared Lee Lofner, who from his own Facebook photos looks like
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.840]  a complete demon, I don't know if this guy is under mind control or not, but we know
[07:25.840 --> 07:30.840]  that Sirhan, Sirhan was, that's even the London Independent and London Guardian, here's the
[07:30.840 --> 07:35.840]  headlines right here, was Robert Kennedy killed by a real man sharing candidate style assassin.
[07:35.840 --> 07:38.040]  That's what the LA police department thinks.
[07:38.040 --> 07:42.800]  London Guardian, New Evidence Challenges official picture of Kennedy shooting, same thing.
[07:42.800 --> 07:49.320]  So that's all come out on that front, Sirhan, Sirhan, Mark David Chapman, John Hinckley
[07:49.320 --> 07:56.160]  Jr., we're going to be talking about that coming up with Jim Mars in about 40 minutes
[07:56.160 --> 07:58.880]  as I said.
[07:58.880 --> 08:05.760]  By the way, the reason a lot of that mind control questions are there is, and we can
[08:05.760 --> 08:10.240]  punch this up on screen, we're not just a radio show, we're also streaming a video
[08:10.240 --> 08:14.360]  of everything we're talking about at prisonplanet.tv if you want to go over and actually watch
[08:14.360 --> 08:15.360]  it.
[08:15.360 --> 08:22.200]  Here's a screenshot from his YouTube channel, it hasn't been taken down yet, his MySpace
[08:22.200 --> 08:27.760]  was, but we were able to copy that, and the whole thing is mind control.
[08:27.760 --> 08:34.720]  He says, if I'm the mind controller, then I control the belief and the religion.
[08:34.720 --> 08:40.680]  And I've studied the creepy declassified evidence of MKUltra, MK Naomi, the admitted government
[08:40.680 --> 08:45.760]  mind control operation, and the people who are under mind control always believe they
[08:45.760 --> 08:50.360]  are the mind controller, and they always believe they're working for the government on a secret
[08:50.360 --> 08:51.360]  mission.
[08:51.360 --> 08:56.200]  Well, it turns out he told people months ago he was on a secret mission for the government.
[08:56.200 --> 09:01.840]  We have sworn affidavits from Terry Nichols and others that McVeigh told the guards and
[09:01.840 --> 09:06.280]  others that every prison he was at, that he'd been on a secret mission for the government.
[09:06.280 --> 09:11.120]  And then we were able to get FBI documents via four-year lawsuits, and it turned out
[09:11.120 --> 09:13.200]  he was working for the government.
[09:13.200 --> 09:17.520]  Kind of like Fox News reported three months ago, and we're all a-locking.
[09:17.520 --> 09:23.600]  Number three in Al Qaeda on 9-11, number one in operations under bin Laden today, secretly
[09:23.600 --> 09:29.600]  meeting at the Pentagon two months after 9-11 with the army, top brass, including the Secretary
[09:29.600 --> 09:30.600]  of the Army.
[09:30.600 --> 09:35.680]  So he ran the Fort Hood shooter, who was also a psychiatrist and wrote about mind control.
[09:35.680 --> 09:40.760]  He ran the underwear bomber that witnesses saw last Christmas, the Christmas before lasted
[09:40.760 --> 09:45.400]  a little over a year ago, looking drugged and disheveled, being put on the plane without
[09:45.400 --> 09:47.000]  a passport.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.480]  Later that was confirmed, Detroit Free Press, Associated Press, two months after our witnesses
[09:52.480 --> 09:57.600]  on this show, listeners of this broadcast, Kurt Askel and his wife, both lawyers, witnessed
[09:57.600 --> 09:59.840]  the whole thing.
[09:59.840 --> 10:05.320]  And the FBI said it wasn't true, and two months later, the Undersecretary of State, Mr. Kennedy
[10:05.320 --> 10:09.920]  came out and said, yes, we were ordered to get him on the plane by an unnamed intelligence
[10:09.920 --> 10:10.920]  agency.
[10:10.920 --> 10:16.000]  AP, boom, in your face, boom, who's running him?
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.840]  A CIA asset, and we're all a-locking, boom, okay, so, for anybody living in denial about
[10:22.840 --> 10:27.240]  this, this is the facts, and I'm going to walk through all of it, but the establishment
[10:27.240 --> 10:31.160]  didn't waste any time, within hours.
[10:31.160 --> 10:37.240]  They were on his Facebook, on his MySpace, on his YouTube, and I have watched all the
[10:37.240 --> 10:38.800]  videos on there.
[10:38.800 --> 10:44.000]  I spent all my time yesterday, hours and hours today, deeply researching it.
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.440]  I checked all the millions of comments on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, nothing from
[10:49.440 --> 10:55.200]  him, nothing on the web associated with us, Ron Paul, anybody.
[10:55.200 --> 10:59.920]  And so, what does the Southern Poverty Law Center do with Mr. Potok?
[10:59.920 --> 11:05.480]  He blames Ayn Rand, the Fountainhead author.
[11:05.480 --> 11:09.400]  We got this clip coming up, and David Ike, can't even get his name right, calls him David
[11:09.400 --> 11:12.400]  Icke, calls him a right winger.
[11:12.400 --> 11:15.640]  David Ike doesn't believe in the left-right paradigm, but if he was anything, you'd call
[11:15.640 --> 11:19.800]  him a New Age leftist, though he wouldn't like that term, that's the closest mainline
[11:19.800 --> 11:20.800]  label.
[11:20.800 --> 11:27.120]  He had a higher consciousness, basically, Buddhism and total non-violence.
[11:27.120 --> 11:34.000]  Now they're getting kind of guys that covers UFOs and stuff, blaming it on him, who calls
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.000]  for total non-violence.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.240]  I mean, we're going to get David on this week to respond to it.
[11:38.240 --> 11:40.200]  I mean, this is crazy.
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.760]  I'm just glad they're not blaming yours truly.
[11:43.760 --> 11:49.040]  Remember back in 2009, Richard Poplowski, his mother was kicking him out of the house.
[11:49.040 --> 11:51.920]  He had two pit bulls urinating all over the floor.
[11:51.920 --> 11:53.680]  He just got out of the Marine Corps.
[11:53.680 --> 11:57.480]  He was drunk in the early morning hours.
[11:57.480 --> 11:58.680]  He refused to get rid of the dogs.
[11:58.680 --> 11:59.960]  His mother tried to kick him out.
[11:59.960 --> 12:02.440]  He threw a fit, shot three cops when they got there.
[12:02.440 --> 12:05.880]  Within hours, the news said he did it because of me.
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.800]  And then we actually got, the contents were made public of his internet.
[12:10.800 --> 12:16.440]  He was visiting CNN, Fox, and he was all over my website attacking me because I'm against
[12:16.440 --> 12:21.760]  violence, and he was a white supremacist, but they blame, and I forced a retraction
[12:21.760 --> 12:27.000]  in five newspapers, but within two hours of those cops being dead, they tried to blame
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  yours truly.
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.320]  I mean, I'm the one being death-threaded by the white supremacist going on the internet.
[12:32.320 --> 12:33.320]  It's everywhere.
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.680]  I'm sick of it, and you know why, don't you?
[12:37.680 --> 12:41.360]  Because we forced it out in the news, and then it came out in the Orlando newspaper
[12:41.360 --> 12:45.880]  three years ago that the FBI was creating and running the white supremacist groups and
[12:45.880 --> 12:48.840]  having marches through black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
[12:48.840 --> 12:53.840]  We forced it out that Hal Turner was an FBI, national security asset that's now come out
[12:53.840 --> 12:58.560]  in federal court, that talk show host who attacked me every day and sent people after
[12:58.560 --> 13:01.520]  me trying to get folks who do violent things.
[13:01.520 --> 13:04.760]  They don't like it because I know they work for the feds.
[13:04.760 --> 13:09.200]  We have the lawyers on like Jesse Trenadu, who sued and got the documents at the Southern
[13:09.200 --> 13:13.600]  Poverty Law Center, was running Elohim City that McVeigh was at.
[13:13.600 --> 13:16.000]  Not infiltrating it, running it.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.080]  They set this stuff up, and that's why they're after me.
[13:19.080 --> 13:25.640]  And they're very dangerous, very, very, very dangerous people, okay?
[13:25.640 --> 13:29.160]  And that's why the white supremacists are after yours truly, because I know who they're
[13:29.160 --> 13:30.320]  working for.
[13:30.320 --> 13:35.320]  They go out and find mentally ill, insane, violent people, and they try to get them to
[13:35.320 --> 13:39.920]  go out and do violent things so they can use that to crack down on everybody's free speech,
[13:39.920 --> 13:46.680]  every second amendment, just like it's come out, you know, what was it, New York Times,
[13:46.680 --> 13:53.120]  Washington Post, I just covered it again Friday, it was in Salon, you know, Headline, Martinez,
[13:53.120 --> 13:56.640]  he was the latest bomber they were going to have in Maryland, you know, couldn't cook
[13:56.640 --> 13:58.720]  bomb, couldn't get anything ready.
[13:58.720 --> 14:01.440]  The FBI recruited him, tried to help him make it.
[14:01.440 --> 14:06.840]  They go out and find mentally ill prison convicts and people, and if they're Mexican, they try
[14:06.840 --> 14:09.800]  to make them Muslims, or if they're black, they try to make them Muslims.
[14:09.800 --> 14:11.840]  Or if they're Hispanic, they try to make them Muslims.
[14:11.840 --> 14:14.760]  If they're white, they try to make them white supremacists.
[14:14.760 --> 14:15.760]  And that's what the prisons are.
[14:15.760 --> 14:18.120]  We have the biggest prison population in the world.
[14:18.120 --> 14:23.640]  And in the prisons, you got the white supremacist wing, you got the Mexican supremacist wing,
[14:23.640 --> 14:28.000]  you got the black supremacist wing, and that's the end of it.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.880]  And the government actually fosters that and puts you in your wing and then their giant
[14:32.880 --> 14:37.080]  colleges of how to be an extremist dirtbag.
[14:37.080 --> 14:42.040]  And then they get out of prison and the FBI and the Southern Prairie Law Center and all
[14:42.040 --> 14:46.720]  these groups are there to handle them and manipulate them and control them.
[14:46.720 --> 14:49.800]  Now this guy fits the bill.
[14:49.800 --> 14:53.800]  And we've got an incredible photo of him up at infowars.com from his Facebook, and we'll
[14:53.800 --> 14:54.800]  put it up on screen.
[14:54.800 --> 15:01.760]  We come back from break, but it's the top photo on our article and it's updated, Arizona
[15:01.760 --> 15:09.980]  assassin obsessed with mind control, obsessed with mind control.
[15:09.980 --> 15:13.960]  And again, the article is up on the Drudge Report.
[15:13.960 --> 15:16.640]  It's one of the top stories up on the Drudge Report.
[15:16.640 --> 15:20.760]  He's linked to our report, Arizona assassin obsessed with mind control, and then we have
[15:20.760 --> 15:25.240]  links to the congressional hearings, admitting the CIA does have mind control.
[15:25.240 --> 15:29.360]  We have links to all the mainstream news articles admitting that mind control has been involved
[15:29.360 --> 15:34.600]  in other assassinations, and we're going to walk through all of this ahead of Jim Mars
[15:34.600 --> 15:35.600]  joining us.
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.320]  Now I'm not saying he was under mind control, but if we know mind control exists and we
[15:40.320 --> 15:43.600]  know our government and other governments have been involved in it, and he fits the
[15:43.600 --> 15:48.440]  MO of that, and they're already politically using this out of the gates, we're going to
[15:48.440 --> 15:49.440]  look at it.
[15:49.440 --> 15:54.840]  He may have just been a complete violent paranoid schizophrenic, which then mirrors what mind
[15:54.840 --> 16:00.560]  control looks like because they artificially create that schizoid condition.
[16:00.560 --> 16:06.040]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[16:06.040 --> 16:08.760]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[16:08.760 --> 16:11.320]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[16:11.320 --> 16:15.040]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care
[16:15.040 --> 16:16.720]  of your health and your own family.
[16:16.720 --> 16:19.760]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[16:19.760 --> 16:22.080]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[16:22.080 --> 16:26.320]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[16:26.320 --> 16:28.320]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[16:28.320 --> 16:31.600]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[16:31.600 --> 16:35.760]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[16:35.760 --> 16:38.920]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[16:38.920 --> 16:40.440]  I can't stress this enough.
[16:40.440 --> 16:43.080]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[16:43.080 --> 16:47.320]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[16:47.320 --> 16:54.640]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's End of America, the number 3.com.
[16:54.640 --> 17:01.040]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[17:01.040 --> 17:04.120]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[17:04.120 --> 17:08.480]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[17:08.480 --> 17:09.480]  do you want?
[17:09.480 --> 17:11.480]  My answer would be all I can get.
[17:11.480 --> 17:16.520]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[17:16.520 --> 17:17.720]  How much do you want?
[17:17.720 --> 17:18.720]  When do you want it?
[17:18.720 --> 17:20.760]  Now or after the battle starts?
[17:20.760 --> 17:21.880]  When will you need it?
[17:21.880 --> 17:24.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[17:24.000 --> 17:25.360]  Will there be any food?
[17:25.360 --> 17:26.800]  Will it make your children sick?
[17:26.800 --> 17:30.960]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[17:30.960 --> 17:32.120]  and be immunized?
[17:32.120 --> 17:35.880]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[17:35.880 --> 17:39.480]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[17:39.480 --> 17:40.720]  How much will you need?
[17:40.720 --> 17:41.720]  We don't know.
[17:41.720 --> 17:42.720]  How much do you want?
[17:42.720 --> 17:43.720]  All you can get.
[17:43.720 --> 17:44.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[17:44.720 --> 17:47.720]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[17:47.720 --> 17:55.440]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[17:55.440 --> 18:00.120]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[18:00.120 --> 18:04.760]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[18:04.760 --> 18:09.080]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[18:09.080 --> 18:13.400]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[18:13.400 --> 18:14.680]  allows you to have.
[18:14.680 --> 18:15.680]  That's true.
[18:15.680 --> 18:20.440]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[18:20.440 --> 18:24.760]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[18:24.760 --> 18:28.760]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[18:28.760 --> 18:32.240]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[18:32.240 --> 18:35.960]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[18:35.960 --> 18:40.680]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[18:40.680 --> 18:44.480]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[18:44.480 --> 18:45.880]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[18:45.880 --> 18:50.120]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[18:50.120 --> 18:51.760]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[18:51.760 --> 19:00.040]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[19:00.040 --> 19:01.480]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[19:01.480 --> 19:05.120]  You've heard me talk about Calben 5 Star Soaps for years.
[19:05.120 --> 19:09.400]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find
[19:09.400 --> 19:10.400]  in stores.
[19:10.400 --> 19:13.800]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[19:13.800 --> 19:20.320]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091.
[19:20.320 --> 19:24.080]  Take my word for it, once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[19:24.080 --> 19:29.080]  Since 1947, Calben Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and
[19:29.080 --> 19:30.520]  gentle on the environment.
[19:30.520 --> 19:33.680]  Buy American and stay clean, as well as support info wars.

[19:47.040 --> 19:58.040]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website, 5starsoap.com.
[19:58.040 --> 19:59.040]  Thank you.
[20:01.040 --> 20:05.040]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[20:05.040 --> 20:08.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:08.040 --> 20:09.040]  Hit it.
[20:09.040 --> 20:11.040]  We've got it.
[20:11.040 --> 20:16.040]  That transmission is coming to you.
[20:16.040 --> 20:20.040]  Waging war on corruption.
[20:20.040 --> 20:22.040]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[20:22.040 --> 20:29.040]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[20:29.040 --> 20:33.040]  If you're listening on the radio, I would direct you to thedrugreport.com.
[20:33.040 --> 20:40.040]  We've posted so many articles, so much analysis with my crew that it's already moved off the main page into archives.
[20:40.040 --> 20:43.040]  The Drudge has still got it up in the top links.
[20:43.040 --> 20:45.040]  It's the next to the bottom.
[20:45.040 --> 20:47.040]  They're at drudgerport.com.
[20:47.040 --> 20:49.040]  Obsessed with mind control.
[20:49.040 --> 20:51.040]  That's the article you want to read.
[20:51.040 --> 20:56.040]  And then it's been updated today with another article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[20:56.040 --> 20:59.040]  Toning down the rhetoric means obeying big government.
[20:59.040 --> 21:04.040]  Arizona assassin obsessed with mind control.
[21:04.040 --> 21:11.040]  And that, of course, is Jared Lee Loeffner, who's shot in the head,
[21:11.040 --> 21:16.040]  Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who, thank God, is not dead and is responding.
[21:16.040 --> 21:18.040]  We hope she has a full recovery.
[21:18.040 --> 21:23.040]  Killed a little nine-year-old girl, killed a federal judge, killed three other people.
[21:23.040 --> 21:27.040]  It was six dead, a whole bunch of others, obviously wounded.
[21:27.040 --> 21:30.040]  Everybody knows those facts.
[21:30.040 --> 21:41.040]  The larger issue here is who is this guy really, A, and B, how dare Keith Oberman and Fox News, for that matter.
[21:41.040 --> 21:45.040]  Not just MSNBC, but also Fox News, but even more so Keith Oberman.
[21:45.040 --> 21:47.040]  We're going to play a clip of this coming up.
[21:47.040 --> 21:53.040]  Come out and say with the Southern Private Law Center that this is the fault of Eindrand.
[21:53.040 --> 21:58.040]  You know, a lady who wrote books 50-something years ago about peaceful resistance to tyranny.
[21:58.040 --> 22:04.040]  And they actually say in this clip that anybody who thinks about the individual against the state
[22:04.040 --> 22:09.040]  or the individual being more important than the state, that's the fundamentals of America.
[22:09.040 --> 22:11.040]  That's what the founding fathers said.
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.040]  That's why our republic has always been different.
[22:15.040 --> 22:18.040]  And they say, that's just terrible.
[22:18.040 --> 22:24.040]  Then they go on to demonize David Ike and call him a right-wing conspiracy theorist.
[22:24.040 --> 22:30.040]  David Ike, if you want to use terms that are kind of mainstream, is kind of like a New Age type guy.
[22:30.040 --> 22:32.040]  All about peace and love.
[22:32.040 --> 22:38.040]  And by the way, there's no mention of David Ike because the guy talks about conscious dreaming,
[22:38.040 --> 22:42.040]  which is talked about by hundreds and hundreds of authors that I know of.
[22:42.040 --> 22:46.040]  Again, kind of a New Age or Buddhist type deal.
[22:46.040 --> 22:48.040]  I mean, this is crazy.
[22:48.040 --> 22:49.040]  This is crazy.
[22:49.040 --> 22:50.040]  I've read all this guy's stuff.
[22:50.040 --> 22:52.040]  I've watched all his videos.
[22:52.040 --> 22:53.040]  Nothing about Eindrand.
[22:53.040 --> 22:54.040]  Nothing about David Ike.
[22:54.040 --> 22:58.040]  They just take vague terms and say that means he's right-wing.
[22:58.040 --> 23:06.040]  Well, really, the main thing he praises in videos and in text, the main thing is the communist manifesto.
[23:06.040 --> 23:12.040]  That's more Obama or Keith Oberman.
[23:12.040 --> 23:20.040]  I mean, this is a guy, he also likes Mein Kampf, which the control left in this country has taught folks is right-wing.
[23:20.040 --> 23:22.040]  They were national socialist.
[23:22.040 --> 23:24.040]  Hitler was a vegetarian.
[23:24.040 --> 23:26.040]  He wanted big government to run people's lives.
[23:26.040 --> 23:31.040]  Now, he used a fascist system to rob the population, but he was a socialist.
[23:31.040 --> 23:36.040]  That's what Nazi means, National Socialist Workers Party.
[23:36.040 --> 23:42.040]  Now, continuing here, I am just so blown away by this, but Fox News goes further.
[23:42.040 --> 23:44.040]  They don't say left-wing or right-wing.
[23:44.040 --> 23:51.040]  They say conspiracy theorist because Jared Lee Loeffner talked about currencies.
[23:51.040 --> 23:53.040]  But he didn't talk about gold and silver.
[23:53.040 --> 23:56.040]  He talked about some other weird, quacky currency.
[23:56.040 --> 24:01.040]  And of course, that's one of the hottest issues in the world right now because currencies are being devalued.
[24:01.040 --> 24:11.040]  In the 1980s, when Mexico devalued its peso, people were talking about that, not because they were white supremacists or because they wanted to shoot nine-year-olds,
[24:11.040 --> 24:13.040]  but because they were losing their purchasing power.
[24:13.040 --> 24:15.040]  I mean, that's all over the news every day.
[24:15.040 --> 24:24.040]  The currency wars that are happening, how the Chinese are coming out and not trading in the dollar anymore and moving away from it.
[24:24.040 --> 24:33.040]  So the overall message here is, if anybody does anything wrong, then it's everyone's fault who has any political agreements with them.
[24:33.040 --> 24:40.040]  Really, I didn't see MSNBC do that last year with the guy that took all the hostages at Discovery Channel,
[24:40.040 --> 24:44.040]  who thought there were too many people and was a big leftist environmentalist.
[24:44.040 --> 24:45.040]  I didn't see that.
[24:45.040 --> 24:50.040]  Or I don't hear them freaking out all the time, you know, when left-wing people do things that are bad.
[24:50.040 --> 25:00.040]  Since when are we this collectivist model where we now have this world of social media where everybody talks about who they are and what they are?
[25:00.040 --> 25:10.040]  And so I guess if somebody's a child molester and they own stock in Coca-Cola, does that mean Coca-Cola is doing things?
[25:10.040 --> 25:11.040]  No.
[25:11.040 --> 25:14.040]  I mean, it's just amazing guilt by association.
[25:14.040 --> 25:20.040]  And I've got a big stack of articles here today. Here is Yahoo News.
[25:20.040 --> 25:26.040]  In the aftermath of the Giffords shooting, a debate over heated political rhetoric.
[25:26.040 --> 25:28.040]  You know, should it be restricted?
[25:28.040 --> 25:30.040]  Here's another one out of MPR.
[25:30.040 --> 25:35.040]  Vitriol cited as possible factor in Arizona tragedy.
[25:35.040 --> 25:38.040]  It goes on from there.
[25:38.040 --> 25:47.040]  Paul Watson has a big article on this. Political hacks waste no time in shamelessly exploiting Giffords shooting to demonize political opposition.
[25:47.040 --> 25:50.040]  And what do we have going on at the same time?
[25:50.040 --> 25:52.040]  We have the big headlines out there.
[25:52.040 --> 25:58.040]  Obama wants Internet ID to track you in real time everywhere you travel on the web.
[25:58.040 --> 25:59.040]  Another big headline.
[25:59.040 --> 26:07.040]  FCC wants to restrict hate speech on Internet, declaring jurisdiction over the web and saying what you can and can't say.
[26:07.040 --> 26:13.040]  In many countries in Europe, you're not allowed to criticize the government or you get arrested now.
[26:13.040 --> 26:14.040]  This is a tyranny.
[26:14.040 --> 26:20.040]  And so they set the precedent that, oh, we don't let extremists have speech, and then it turns out to be everybody.
[26:20.040 --> 26:23.040]  If everyone doesn't have free speech, no one does.
[26:23.040 --> 26:29.040]  And of course, we're going to go into a violent climate with the economy imploding, joblessness well above 22%.
[26:29.040 --> 26:34.040]  The government says 9.6, total fraud, according to all the mainline economists out there.
[26:34.040 --> 26:38.040]  We have this sickening culture of death.
[26:38.040 --> 26:40.040]  I was watching this guy's videos.
[26:40.040 --> 26:46.040]  It's him dressed up as a grim reaper, playing really freaked out Marilyn Manson style.
[26:46.040 --> 26:50.040]  Watch the bodies at the floor. Watch the bodies at the floor.
[26:50.040 --> 27:00.040]  All this stuff that little guys in the basement who only eat MSG filled hot pockets, they sit in there playing violent death video games all day.
[27:00.040 --> 27:01.040]  They can't get any women.
[27:01.040 --> 27:04.040]  They think they're real tough walking around the streets.
[27:04.040 --> 27:10.040]  You see them all the time, like, you know, 10 or 15 of them walking down the drag at UT in black, all trying to look scary.
[27:10.040 --> 27:15.040]  And I'm just like, automatically, just want to, like, I see a pack of weakness.
[27:15.040 --> 27:16.040]  I just want to, who wants a war?
[27:16.040 --> 27:17.040]  I'm like, here I am, punks.
[27:17.040 --> 27:19.040]  And they always scurry off.
[27:19.040 --> 27:21.040]  But they're real tough when they got a gun.
[27:21.040 --> 27:27.040]  They're a bunch of vampire wannabe pibs dressed up in black that think they're tough.
[27:27.040 --> 27:31.040]  And every once in a while, they're all into having crazed eyes and trying to scare people.
[27:31.040 --> 27:35.040]  Like, if we can, let's put that image of this scumbag back up there.
[27:35.040 --> 27:40.040]  Whether he was mind controlled or not, he was definitely a schizophrenic fruit loop.
[27:40.040 --> 27:44.040]  You can't make up this type of violent paranoid schizophrenia.
[27:44.040 --> 27:45.040]  Go watch these videos.
[27:45.040 --> 27:50.040]  This guy dressed up like a grim reaper, burning an American flag and just look into his eyes.
[27:50.040 --> 27:52.040]  Just a crazed scumbag.
[27:52.040 --> 27:53.040]  Let me tell you something.
[27:53.040 --> 27:55.040]  That's what the Second Amendment's for.
[27:55.040 --> 27:58.040]  Mexico has now had 30,000 deaths.
[27:58.040 --> 28:01.040]  I keep saying 28,000 deaths for like the last six months.
[28:01.040 --> 28:02.040]  I looked at the numbers this weekend.
[28:02.040 --> 28:09.040]  It passed in December over 30,000 deaths in the last two years down there.
[28:09.040 --> 28:15.040]  Police, mayors, members of their Congress, they've had presidential candidates killed.
[28:15.040 --> 28:18.040]  They have a total gun ban in Mexico.
[28:18.040 --> 28:20.040]  No citizen can own a gun.
[28:20.040 --> 28:24.040]  You got a paramilitary out of control, narcotics trafficking state.
[28:24.040 --> 28:30.040]  More citizens, more cops, more members of government being killed because there's a total gun ban.
[28:30.040 --> 28:33.040]  The answer is more guns.
[28:33.040 --> 28:37.040]  It was citizens that tackled this lunatic and stopped him.
[28:37.040 --> 28:41.040]  It was a woman that grabbed the clip away after he'd fired a bunch of rounds.
[28:41.040 --> 28:43.040]  It was men that then tackled him.
[28:43.040 --> 28:44.040]  Good job for them.
[28:44.040 --> 28:48.040]  There should have been a concealed carry person there to kill that guy.
[28:48.040 --> 28:50.040]  Somebody like that came around here.
[28:50.040 --> 28:55.040]  I got a 357 magnum right here to deal with him and that Congresswoman should have been packing heat.
[28:55.040 --> 28:57.040]  Will they ride back, stay with us?
[28:57.040 --> 28:58.040]  More guns, less crime.
[28:58.040 --> 29:21.040]  We can stop this scum.

[30:00.040 --> 30:03.040]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[30:03.040 --> 30:09.040]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[30:09.040 --> 30:11.040]  My answer would be all I can get.
[30:11.040 --> 30:16.040]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[30:16.040 --> 30:17.040]  How much do you want?
[30:17.040 --> 30:18.040]  When do you want it?
[30:18.040 --> 30:20.040]  Now or after the battle starts?
[30:20.040 --> 30:21.040]  When will you need it?
[30:21.040 --> 30:23.040]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[30:23.040 --> 30:24.040]  Will there be any food?
[30:24.040 --> 30:26.040]  Will it make your children sick?
[30:26.040 --> 30:31.040]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[30:31.040 --> 30:35.040]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[30:35.040 --> 30:39.040]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[30:39.040 --> 30:40.040]  How much will you need?
[30:40.040 --> 30:41.040]  We don't know.
[30:41.040 --> 30:42.040]  How much do you want?
[30:42.040 --> 30:43.040]  All you can get.
[30:43.040 --> 30:44.040]  I'm Alex Jones.
[30:44.040 --> 30:47.040]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[30:47.040 --> 30:54.040]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[30:54.040 --> 31:22.040]  Again that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[31:22.040 --> 31:28.040]  Close in the doors and shut her down tomorrow.
[31:28.040 --> 31:34.040]  I'm looking for America.
[31:34.040 --> 31:39.040]  Where American and be proud, go to Busset.com forward slash America.
[31:39.040 --> 32:04.040]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[32:04.040 --> 32:10.040]  1- New Climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:10.040 --> 32:14.040]  2- Our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[32:14.040 --> 32:15.040]  It's true.
[32:15.040 --> 32:20.040]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[32:20.040 --> 32:24.040]  3- In some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[32:24.040 --> 32:28.040]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:28.040 --> 32:32.040]  4- Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[32:32.040 --> 32:35.240]  thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[32:35.240 --> 32:36.240]  Number 5.
[32:36.240 --> 32:40.040]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[32:40.040 --> 32:43.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[32:43.880 --> 32:45.280]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[32:45.280 --> 32:51.160]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[32:51.160 --> 33:01.880]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:01.880 --> 33:05.360]  Just a coast, direct from Austin.
[33:05.360 --> 33:30.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:30.960 --> 33:36.880]  If you had to look at his type, he's basically like an Eric Harris or a Clybold Columbine
[33:36.880 --> 33:42.200]  type who liked communists, who liked Nazis, who was an atheist.
[33:42.200 --> 33:51.200]  He was an atheist, he was into death, he made jokes constantly at college about loving abortion.
[33:51.200 --> 33:52.800]  It's always the same.
[33:52.800 --> 33:58.880]  The guy that shot up the Pentagon was into that, the Harris and Clybold were into that,
[33:58.880 --> 34:02.840]  and boy, if you researched that, that had weird government fingerprints all over it.
[34:02.840 --> 34:08.400]  240-something bombs brought into the building, that's CBS News, half the school empty, Harris
[34:08.400 --> 34:12.880]  and Clybold made weird videos about attacking the school, nothing was done, they had death
[34:12.880 --> 34:19.480]  education at the school, they were on Prozac type drugs, it was confirmed in the Rocky
[34:19.480 --> 34:24.840]  Mountain newspaper that the SWAT team had at least shot some of the kids, other witnesses
[34:24.840 --> 34:27.000]  said there were other shooters inside.
[34:27.000 --> 34:33.040]  That was said with this event, when you really study this stuff, it gets super creepy.
[34:33.040 --> 34:38.320]  And is this a mind control program, some type of mind control overlay, that they're always
[34:38.320 --> 34:42.280]  into black trench coats and things, and he's dressing up like the Grim Reaper, burning
[34:42.280 --> 34:49.280]  American flags, and he loves the Communist Manifesto, and then CNN, MSNBC, here's Politico
[34:49.280 --> 34:54.760]  right here, I'll show folks watching on Prism Point of Dot TV, a document cam shot, it says
[34:54.760 --> 35:06.000]  Loeffner's Ties to Conspiracy Theory, and it's just bizarre to see that, then he also
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.640]  claims he was part of a secret government operation in Afghanistan, you see that with
[35:12.640 --> 35:17.200]  McVeigh and then in court documents it turned out, he was involved in secret army operations
[35:17.200 --> 35:24.480]  after he got out, you see that with these other shooters, but it mirrors normal Schizophrenia,
[35:24.480 --> 35:28.840]  normal Paranoid, delusional Schizophrenics, because when the government gets you for
[35:28.840 --> 35:33.440]  an MKUltra type mind control operation on record, this came out in Congressional hearings,
[35:33.440 --> 35:36.880]  we're going to cover it with an expert coming up in the next segment, they break your mind
[35:36.880 --> 35:42.080]  into compartments, and then you have a compulsion, if you want to see an accurate representation
[35:42.080 --> 35:48.240]  of it, see the movie, the Manchurian candidate, the new version with Denzel Washington, minus
[35:48.240 --> 35:53.360]  the microchips, they do admittedly have chips that can control the brain, I saw studies
[35:53.360 --> 35:58.800]  over 30 years ago in the 70s, done in the 70s where they had remote control cockroaches,
[35:58.800 --> 36:04.760]  rats, monkeys, and now humans, humans who are paralyzed and volunteered and had chips
[36:04.760 --> 36:10.280]  put in their brains and been able to get motor control, but it's just a very, very bizarre
[36:10.280 --> 36:16.840]  what's going on, but to see the media go into absolute overdrive with this and really call
[36:16.840 --> 36:23.680]  for restricting free speech, it is extremely creepy.
[36:23.680 --> 36:31.960]  Speaking of conspiracy theory, before I go further, in 2000, in 2005, over 90% of the
[36:31.960 --> 36:36.640]  scientists from two different federal agencies, the Food and Drug Administration, but also
[36:36.640 --> 36:41.240]  the Environmental Protection Agency, got together and the heads of their unions sent
[36:41.240 --> 36:47.720]  giant signed letters, signed by thousands, to Congress and others saying sodium fluoride
[36:47.720 --> 36:52.520]  is causing brain damage, at least double in cancer, here's the mainline studies, it's
[36:52.520 --> 36:57.240]  causing dental fluorosis, please take it out of the water.
[36:57.240 --> 37:04.480]  We get called cooks for that, well, here is MSNBC and Associated Press, too much fluoride
[37:04.480 --> 37:10.240]  and water government says high levels cause spots on teeth, recommended limit to be lowered.
[37:10.240 --> 37:14.520]  See, they know you're waking up and filtering it, so they're going, okay, we'll lower it,
[37:14.520 --> 37:19.040]  but it's being added to food now, it's being added to the, it's in the toothpaste folks
[37:19.040 --> 37:25.000]  and causing your teeth to fracture and causing dental fluorosis is only the tip of the iceberg,
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.240]  but again, we were cooks to talk about that for decades, now it's admitted and more and
[37:29.240 --> 37:30.560]  more is coming out.
[37:30.560 --> 37:36.160]  We were cooks to tell you that the regular flu shot, again, more than doubles your chances
[37:36.160 --> 37:41.720]  of getting next season's flu, that's mainline, hundreds of studies going back decades, now
[37:41.720 --> 37:46.600]  that's admitted, British Medical Journal, 10-fold increase in seizures in children that
[37:46.600 --> 37:53.300]  take flu shots regularly, now they're calling for it not to be given to people under six.
[37:53.300 --> 37:56.720]  More and more of what we cover here, just go back five years ago, you'd be a cook if
[37:56.720 --> 38:01.240]  you talked about the Federal Reserve, it was a buzzword, now 80 plus percent wanted audited
[38:01.240 --> 38:05.520]  or abolished in Gallup polls and we're very close to auditing it and people know it's
[38:05.520 --> 38:07.400]  what really runs the country.
[38:07.400 --> 38:11.120]  So just like people didn't know about the Federal Reserve being private five years ago
[38:11.120 --> 38:16.680]  or fluoride being deadly five years ago, most people don't know, mind control is certified,
[38:16.680 --> 38:20.360]  admitted, tens of billions have been spent on it.
[38:20.360 --> 38:24.560]  It's real folks, it's not just in Hollywood movies, we're going to be covering that, but
[38:24.560 --> 38:36.600]  first I want to play this sickening, sickening, sickening clip where they say Ayn Rand is
[38:36.600 --> 38:46.640]  bad, I mean a best-selling author, dead for decades, a feminist, not liberal, not conservative,
[38:46.640 --> 38:48.040]  now it's her fault.
[38:48.040 --> 38:52.720]  And then David Ike, former head of the Green Party in England, if you had to give him a
[38:52.720 --> 38:59.560]  mainstream label, a liberal new-ager, calls for total Zen Buddhist, you know, non-violence
[38:59.560 --> 39:02.680]  and that's who the Southern Powering Law Center blames for this.
[39:02.680 --> 39:09.120]  It is outrageous, outrageous, it's a seven-minute clip, it's up on infowars.com and watch the
[39:09.120 --> 39:14.120]  whole thing and they also claim if you're into precious metals you're somehow a terrorist
[39:14.120 --> 39:18.760]  because the guy mumbled about currencies which he wouldn't even talk about silver and gold.
[39:18.760 --> 39:24.440]  I mean this guy is crazy, any way you slice it, whether it's, you know, happen naturally
[39:24.440 --> 39:30.160]  or it's artificial and I mean do we blame every liberal out there because the guy liked
[39:30.160 --> 39:31.800]  the communist manifesto?
[39:31.800 --> 39:37.520]  I mean this is, since when in America do these people want to silence political debate?
[39:37.520 --> 39:42.680]  They want to demonize anybody having free speech to shut it down, here's the clip.
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.880]  We are admittedly in somewhat speculative territory still here as it clarifies, however this
[39:47.880 --> 39:51.800]  is one of the rare cases where a political assassin, if Loftner is indeed guilty, has
[39:51.800 --> 39:56.360]  been caught alive and whatever questions we have tonight, the gunman himself in theories
[39:56.360 --> 40:01.520]  again some day answer, although the sheriff says he has invoked his right to remain silent.
[40:01.520 --> 40:05.480]  Until then, let's draw on the expertise of the Southern Powering Law Center that attracts
[40:05.480 --> 40:09.720]  political militancy in this country and Mark Botok is the director of the Center's Intelligence
[40:09.720 --> 40:10.720]  Project.
[40:10.720 --> 40:13.220]  Thanks for your time tonight, sir.
[40:13.220 --> 40:15.640]  Thank you for having me, Keith.
[40:15.640 --> 40:19.320]  Center's Internet Trail, does it tell us anything about his politics?
[40:19.320 --> 40:22.840]  Does that specific reference to the Eighth District, the Congresswoman's District, does
[40:22.840 --> 40:27.880]  that step out of the incoherence or is it just part of the incoherence?
[40:27.880 --> 40:31.400]  Well you're right, that reading through all of his materials or the materials that are
[40:31.400 --> 40:39.120]  purported to be his, he sounds quite mad out of his mind, but there is a thread through
[40:39.120 --> 40:44.160]  the material that really seems pretty clear and that thread has to do with seeing the
[40:44.160 --> 40:47.120]  government as an enemy.
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.680]  The books you mentioned, there's a theme that runs through all of them, in particular the
[40:50.680 --> 40:56.560]  Ayn Rand book, the idea of the individual against the state, but there are ideas like
[40:56.560 --> 41:02.400]  the idea of the only legitimate currency being backed by gold and silver, and that's a core
[41:02.400 --> 41:05.880]  idea of the radical right in this country.
[41:05.880 --> 41:13.200]  The idea, weirdly enough, of controlling grammar, of somehow the government using grammar to
[41:13.200 --> 41:18.160]  control the people is an idea that exists on the radical right.
[41:18.160 --> 41:22.240]  There's a particular person, a man named David Wynne Miller, who has plugged this idea over
[41:22.240 --> 41:23.920]  the years.
[41:23.920 --> 41:29.320]  This man also talked quite a lot in these strange videos of his about what he called
[41:29.320 --> 41:36.040]  conscious streaming, but I think is almost certainly meant to be conscious streaming,
[41:36.040 --> 41:40.440]  which is an idea that also has been kind of tossed around in the radical right, in particular
[41:40.440 --> 41:45.080]  by a kind of British conspiracy theorist by the name of David Icky.
[41:45.080 --> 41:49.600]  So a lot of these ideas, his burning of the flag, his talking about the government, his
[41:49.600 --> 41:55.960]  treasonous in using mind control to control the rest of us and so on, these are all ideas
[41:55.960 --> 42:00.040]  or kind of shards of ideas that exist.
[42:00.040 --> 42:03.600]  And then I've got a whole stack of mainstream news calling for restricting freedom on the
[42:03.600 --> 42:09.520]  web, people getting in trouble if they talk bad about the government, potalk of the southern
[42:09.520 --> 42:16.240]  slimy center is there trying to demonize the libertarian conservative movement in this country.
[42:16.240 --> 42:21.560]  This country was founded on small government, founded on not trusting it.
[42:21.560 --> 42:24.480]  Look at the trouble we've gotten in because of big government.
[42:24.480 --> 42:29.200]  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, he then goes on to say the radical right is into silver
[42:29.200 --> 42:31.040]  and gold.
[42:31.040 --> 42:35.160]  That's in the Constitution that that's our money.
[42:35.160 --> 42:37.840]  But now Congress isn't even controlling our currency.
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.480]  That's controlled by the private Federal Reserve in violation of the Constitution.
[42:42.480 --> 42:43.480]  So just incredible.
[42:43.480 --> 42:50.280]  And as things get worse and worse, as Gerald Salente says, when people lose everything,
[42:50.280 --> 42:51.280]  they lose it.
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.440]  When things get crazy, people get crazy and they're going to try to use this to bring
[42:55.440 --> 42:56.440]  even more tyranny.
[42:56.440 --> 43:01.760]  We're going to look at the mind control angle straight ahead.
[43:01.760 --> 43:05.920]  You've heard Alex explaining how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[43:05.920 --> 43:10.640]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[43:10.640 --> 43:14.480]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[43:14.480 --> 43:17.160]  anywhere in or on the body.
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.920]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[43:21.920 --> 43:26.520]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[43:26.520 --> 43:31.160]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[43:31.160 --> 43:34.680]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[43:34.680 --> 43:41.480]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive
[43:41.480 --> 43:42.480]  system.
[43:42.480 --> 43:49.880]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com
[43:49.880 --> 43:52.960]  to learn more about how the silver lung system works.
[43:52.960 --> 43:56.960]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[43:56.960 --> 44:05.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com My folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.280]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family
[44:09.280 --> 44:11.320]  owned and operated American company.
[44:11.320 --> 44:16.120]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[44:16.120 --> 44:18.760]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[44:18.760 --> 44:22.760]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[44:22.760 --> 44:30.840]  anywhere get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com
[44:30.840 --> 44:32.340]  or infowars.com.
[44:32.340 --> 44:36.440]  Let's talk to the owner of 5-star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[44:36.440 --> 44:43.120]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.240]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[44:47.240 --> 44:58.240]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a one to two month
[44:58.240 --> 44:59.240]  soap sampler.
[44:59.240 --> 45:00.240]  Thank you.
[45:00.240 --> 45:05.880]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[45:05.880 --> 45:08.600]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[45:08.600 --> 45:11.120]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[45:11.120 --> 45:14.840]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care
[45:14.840 --> 45:16.520]  of your health and your own family.
[45:16.520 --> 45:19.560]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[45:19.560 --> 45:21.880]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[45:21.880 --> 45:26.080]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[45:26.080 --> 45:28.080]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[45:28.080 --> 45:31.400]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[45:31.400 --> 45:35.520]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[45:35.520 --> 45:38.720]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[45:38.720 --> 45:40.200]  I can't stress this enough.
[45:40.200 --> 45:42.840]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[45:42.840 --> 45:46.480]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect
[45:46.480 --> 45:47.480]  yourself.
[45:47.480 --> 45:54.440]  You can find the video at www.EndofAmerica3.com, that's End of America, the number 3.com.
[45:54.440 --> 46:00.080]  Watch the free video at www.EndofAmerica3.com, that's End of America 3.com.
[46:00.080 --> 46:03.840]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[46:03.840 --> 46:08.200]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[46:08.200 --> 46:09.200]  do you want?
[46:09.200 --> 46:11.200]  My answer would be all I can get.
[46:11.200 --> 46:16.200]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[46:16.200 --> 46:17.440]  How much do you want?
[46:17.440 --> 46:18.520]  When do you want it?
[46:18.520 --> 46:20.480]  Now or after the battle starts?
[46:20.480 --> 46:21.600]  When will you need it?
[46:21.600 --> 46:23.720]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[46:23.720 --> 46:25.080]  Will there be any food?
[46:25.080 --> 46:26.520]  Will it make your children sick?
[46:26.520 --> 46:30.680]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[46:30.680 --> 46:31.840]  and be immunized?
[46:31.840 --> 46:35.600]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[46:35.600 --> 46:39.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[46:39.200 --> 46:40.440]  How much will you need?
[46:40.440 --> 46:41.440]  We don't know.
[46:41.440 --> 46:42.440]  How much do you want?
[46:42.440 --> 46:43.440]  All you can get.
[46:43.440 --> 46:44.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[46:44.440 --> 46:47.440]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[46:47.440 --> 46:54.960]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[46:54.960 --> 47:01.800]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[47:01.800 --> 47:05.440]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[47:05.440 --> 47:13.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:13.440 --> 47:21.440]  Ashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[47:21.440 --> 47:29.440]  We're going to be looking next hour at Jared Lee Lofner.
[47:29.440 --> 47:36.560]  And I got to tell you, the evidence is leaning towards mind control, electroshock drugs.
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.160]  Then they literally program the brain where they have a compulsion to kill.
[47:40.160 --> 47:41.400]  He told friends that.
[47:41.400 --> 47:45.320]  He talked about it on his MySpace.
[47:45.320 --> 47:49.880]  And I don't come at this just because I like to say, oh, there aren't lunatics out there
[47:49.880 --> 47:51.720]  that go out and do violent things.
[47:51.720 --> 47:57.600]  I come at this because I've been doing research for 16 years on air, really 18 years on and
[47:57.600 --> 47:59.240]  off air.
[47:59.240 --> 48:05.720]  And I have the LA Times where it came out that the unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, was
[48:05.720 --> 48:10.000]  a CIA MKUltra mind control victim.
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.080]  He volunteered for it when he was at Princeton and then disappeared for several years.
[48:16.080 --> 48:21.600]  I know that Lee Harvey Oswald, it came out, and Jim Mars, the real expert on that, was
[48:21.600 --> 48:23.920]  in the same LSD experiments.
[48:23.920 --> 48:25.760]  You can't make this stuff up.
[48:25.760 --> 48:31.400]  And then when you look at a lot of the other famous people, Sirhan Sirhan, I mean, I've
[48:31.400 --> 48:37.480]  got London Independent and The Guardian newspaper saying conclusively it was a Manchurian candidate.
[48:37.480 --> 48:42.240]  But David Chapman, complete operation, told friends and family, girlfriend is working
[48:42.240 --> 48:44.920]  for the government, John Hinckley Jr.
[48:44.920 --> 48:48.000]  Oh, we can spend hours on each one of these.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.040]  The point is, these are real programs.
[48:50.040 --> 48:51.040]  This is going on.
[48:51.040 --> 48:56.520]  But as for the idea that we can go download your computer when you kill somebody and
[48:56.520 --> 49:01.120]  then blame anyone that you liked for it is crazy.
[49:01.120 --> 49:05.360]  And the media said there were WMDs in Iraq when they knew it wasn't true.
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.640]  Now over a million dead Iraqis, 6,000 dead U.S. troops, you know, there you can really
[49:09.640 --> 49:13.160]  point out where lies are leading to violence.
[49:13.160 --> 49:16.520]  But the government's doing politically destructive things.
[49:16.520 --> 49:18.440]  There is a move towards revolution in this country.
[49:18.440 --> 49:20.200]  I want to keep it peaceful.
[49:20.200 --> 49:25.120]  But right now they have a reason to stage these false flags to mail government buildings,
[49:25.120 --> 49:29.880]  these firecracker bombs as a way to start using this giant police state and the telescreens
[49:29.880 --> 49:34.600]  going in, the Walmarts and the surveillance and the TSA on the streets.
[49:34.600 --> 49:35.880]  That's what this is all about.
[49:35.880 --> 49:38.720]  So joining us, at least 30 minutes, maybe even longer in the next hour, but he's on
[49:38.720 --> 49:43.600]  a deadline for a book he's writing, is Jim Mars, a real expert on this area.
[49:43.600 --> 49:48.080]  And I'm an expert too, but he's a super expert on these Manchurian candidates.
[49:48.080 --> 49:53.160]  Jim Mars is an American former newspaper journalist, New York Times best-selling author, was a
[49:53.160 --> 49:57.960]  crime reporter for the four-chart telegram, and articles on a wide range of cover-ups.
[49:57.960 --> 50:01.160]  He wrote the book for Oliver Stone's film.
[50:01.160 --> 50:02.160]  It just goes on and on.
[50:02.160 --> 50:09.720]  He taught the first college course on the JFK assassination at the University of Texas
[50:09.720 --> 50:10.720]  at Arlington.
[50:10.720 --> 50:14.960]  And he's a member of Scholars for 9-Eleven Truth, jimmars.com is his website.
[50:14.960 --> 50:18.560]  Jim, this is a quick segment, we're going to come back, but let's go through some of
[50:18.560 --> 50:21.920]  the history of MKUltra over and over again.
[50:21.920 --> 50:27.400]  I've got to say over 80% of the time we end up proving that these guys were in government
[50:27.400 --> 50:28.400]  programs.
[50:28.400 --> 50:34.080]  They had a shooter years ago up in Fort Worth, what, 12 years ago, turned out was in a secret
[50:34.080 --> 50:35.080]  Navy Mind Control program.
[50:35.080 --> 50:37.080]  Remember the guy that went in the Baptist Church?
[50:37.080 --> 50:39.000]  Yeah, that was the church shooting, yeah.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.040]  Yeah, I mean, it just never ends.
[50:41.040 --> 50:44.160]  We're not the ones reporting this, we're just covering it.
[50:44.160 --> 50:46.800]  You've got the floor on the history of Mind Control.
[50:46.800 --> 50:54.200]  Well, this really goes back, again, to the Nazis, as you all know, since you've read
[50:54.200 --> 50:56.960]  and promoted my book, The Rise of the Fourth Right.
[50:56.960 --> 51:03.160]  In fact, the judges at the Nuremberg Warcraft Trials sent us seven German scientists to
[51:03.160 --> 51:07.640]  death for their part in human mind control experiments.
[51:07.640 --> 51:14.280]  Well, the CIA picked it up, and by 1954, the Artichoke program was underway as part of
[51:14.280 --> 51:18.520]  the CIA's technical services staff, and they were not alone.
[51:18.520 --> 51:24.000]  The Navy was also working at this, and that's why in 1959 we saw the book The Manchurian
[51:24.000 --> 51:30.080]  Candidate, which was made into that movie with Frank Samatra, during the Korean War,
[51:30.080 --> 51:31.080]  early 50s.
[51:31.080 --> 51:36.040]  There was a lot of concern about them getting hold of some of our soldiers and brainwashing
[51:36.040 --> 51:42.200]  them and turning them into brainwashed assassins and spies, and what's amazing is there was
[51:42.200 --> 51:49.520]  a Marine at its suki base in Japan who served with Lee Harvey Oswald, who said that Oswald
[51:49.520 --> 51:52.280]  had been part of an LSD experiment there.
[51:52.280 --> 51:58.880]  So while I personally do not think that Oswald was necessarily a brainwashed assassin, that
[51:58.880 --> 52:04.920]  we still have the telltale fingerprints of government mind control experiments and drug
[52:04.920 --> 52:05.920]  experiments.
[52:05.920 --> 52:11.600]  They even killed a man named Olson who threw himself out of the window after being surreptitiously
[52:11.600 --> 52:12.600]  flipped LSD.
[52:12.600 --> 52:19.880]  This is your tax dollars in action, so it's certainly not anyways far out of line to
[52:19.880 --> 52:23.200]  be talking about brain control.
[52:23.200 --> 52:28.840]  Well they had the 77 hearings where they admitted they spent billions of dollars in creating
[52:28.840 --> 52:32.520]  mind control assassins who have no memory.
[52:32.520 --> 52:33.520]  Exactly.
[52:33.520 --> 52:39.040]  And the thing is, too, if you'll go back to some of the notorious shooting instances,
[52:39.040 --> 52:44.280]  the show at Virginia Tech, which by the way was right there by Blackburn, Tennessee, which
[52:44.280 --> 52:49.400]  is some of these mind control and drug experiments were going on, and they're shooting down at
[52:49.400 --> 52:56.800]  Fort Hood, which was an army psychologist, a psychiatrist who ended up shooting a lot
[52:56.800 --> 52:59.880]  of people that belonged to the psychiatric department.
[52:59.880 --> 53:02.080]  Now, you know, what's going on here?
[53:02.080 --> 53:05.520]  Well, of course the media, all they can talk about is guns.
[53:05.520 --> 53:06.520]  You know, guns.
[53:06.520 --> 53:08.960]  Well, you know, come on, I grew up in Texas.
[53:08.960 --> 53:09.960]  We all had guns.
[53:09.960 --> 53:12.160]  We took guns to school sometime.
[53:12.160 --> 53:14.160]  Nobody shot anybody.
[53:14.160 --> 53:16.520]  The difference is drugs.
[53:16.520 --> 53:23.320]  It's the drugs, Cho, the two boys at Columbine, all these guys.
[53:23.320 --> 53:27.600]  They were all on psychiatric, psychotropic drugs.
[53:27.600 --> 53:31.840]  And when you get people on those types of drugs, you got all kinds of problems.
[53:31.840 --> 53:36.800]  And by the way, just to interrupt and back you up in the 1980 trials of Prozac, they
[53:36.800 --> 53:43.000]  found a massive increase in psychotic breaks, people going into almost a dream state, and
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.640]  that their normal impulse control was no longer there.
[53:46.640 --> 53:50.840]  So if you got somebody who already leaning towards psychopathic behavior, then you get
[53:50.840 --> 53:57.040]  a woman drowning her four kids or chopping their arms off, or people going and in almost
[53:57.040 --> 54:03.200]  every case, I can't even think of any, Kip, King, Cole, Harris, Clybold, they're always
[54:03.200 --> 54:09.840]  on Prozac type serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which also were developed for the government
[54:09.840 --> 54:13.800]  decades before as psychotropic, mind control drugs.
[54:13.800 --> 54:14.800]  Please continue.
[54:14.800 --> 54:15.800]  Exactly.
[54:15.800 --> 54:25.640]  In fact, at first, 2009, I believe, the largest cause of death in the U.S. military was suicide.
[54:25.640 --> 54:30.720]  They even shut down Fort Campbell, Kentucky for a time because they were having such an
[54:30.720 --> 54:35.360]  outbreak of suicide and all those people were given psychiatric drugs.
[54:35.360 --> 54:39.520]  It's the drugs, but you're not going to hear about that in the corporate control mass media
[54:39.520 --> 54:45.120]  because the pharmaceutical corporation are one of, it's not their largest advertiser,
[54:45.120 --> 54:47.120]  so they're not going to talk about that.
[54:47.120 --> 54:51.000]  But Alex, you do, you can, and you do.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.240]  Please continue getting into mind control.
[54:53.240 --> 54:54.240]  Okay.
[54:54.240 --> 55:02.400]  Well, you had Dr. Sidney Gottlip, who was authorized by Allen Dulles, who let's not forget, sat
[55:02.400 --> 55:07.160]  on the Warren Commission to figure out, gee, what really happened to President Kennedy,
[55:07.160 --> 55:11.200]  and he began to set up the MKUltra program.
[55:11.200 --> 55:15.840]  Of course, and even with all we know today, and all of that's been well documented, it's
[55:15.840 --> 55:20.880]  been an object of congressional committees, but even with what we know today, we don't
[55:20.880 --> 55:25.760]  really know the full extent of that because Richard Helms ordered Gottlip to destroy all
[55:25.760 --> 55:32.800]  of their documentation, but it's all been continued on at Plum Island and at Fort Dietrich
[55:32.800 --> 55:34.840]  and all of these other places.
[55:34.840 --> 55:39.400]  And one of the things in my new book, The Twin Dollar Conspiracy, which I want to thank
[55:39.400 --> 55:45.800]  you, Alex, for helping to promote, there's a whole section on mycoplasma.
[55:45.800 --> 55:56.800]  Mycoplasma is a walled-up protein that actually activates disease, bacteria, and viruses,
[55:56.800 --> 56:05.000]  and causes a variety of ailments, such as fibromyalgia, Alzheimer's, diabetes, type 2,
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.320]  just on and on, but it depends on your individual productivity.
[56:09.320 --> 56:17.240]  Now, this is a incredibly wonderful biological weapon because most doctors can't find it
[56:17.240 --> 56:22.320]  because they're looking for a virus or a bacteria, and you can't find it.
[56:22.320 --> 56:24.760]  And that's Plum Island, just like the Lyme disease.
[56:24.760 --> 56:25.760]  Exactly.
[56:25.760 --> 56:31.600]  And this mycoplasma, by the way, is probably the cause of Lyme disease.
[56:31.600 --> 56:36.640]  And we had this, the Nazis brought it over, we perfected it, crystallized it, turned it
[56:36.640 --> 56:43.040]  into a synthetic, and in 1986, sold it to Saddam Hussein.
[56:43.040 --> 56:44.040]  And then, of course...
[56:44.040 --> 56:46.040]  And that came out in congressional hearings.
[56:46.040 --> 56:47.040]  Yes.
[56:47.040 --> 56:52.120]  And then during the first Gulf War, he used it against the U.S. troops who then carried
[56:52.120 --> 56:57.560]  this back over to the United States, and according to several doctors, this is now
[56:57.560 --> 57:00.320]  has spread throughout the United States population.
[57:00.320 --> 57:03.600]  And the government's got the treatment for it, but won't tell the troops because then
[57:03.600 --> 57:07.720]  they'd have to admit that it came from what our own government gave Saddam Hussein.
[57:07.720 --> 57:09.440]  That's even come out in congressional hearings.
[57:09.440 --> 57:10.840]  We're going to be back in 60 seconds.
[57:10.840 --> 57:15.920]  We're going to start the second hour, some stations, five, six minutes, who carry the
[57:15.920 --> 57:16.920]  news.
[57:16.920 --> 57:21.560]  And I want to get into the history of mind control, sirhan, sirhan, with RFK, so many
[57:21.560 --> 57:22.560]  others.
[57:22.560 --> 57:29.280]  Then we're going to look at Jared Lee Lofner, this demonic creature who killed all of these
[57:29.280 --> 57:36.120]  people and wounded so many others, and the media now saying restrict free speech in America
[57:36.120 --> 57:37.120]  because of this.
[57:37.120 --> 57:43.000]  Are we going to let them further destroy the republic because of their walking dead they
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.000]  got out there?
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  We'll be right back.
[57:45.000 --> 57:52.400]  Let's do this.
[57:52.400 --> 57:56.120]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[57:56.120 --> 57:59.280]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[57:59.280 --> 58:03.640]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[58:03.640 --> 58:04.640]  at home.
[58:04.640 --> 58:09.280]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[58:09.280 --> 58:10.280]  calling the shots.
[58:10.280 --> 58:15.720]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[58:15.720 --> 58:21.120]  For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel
[58:21.120 --> 58:25.800]  held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[58:25.800 --> 58:30.160]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[58:30.160 --> 58:32.200]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[58:32.200 --> 58:38.160]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall

[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:25.520]  Iraq, killing all those people on our side and the Iraqi side.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.600]  They're making a full court press right now to go after our free speech.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.400]  I want to come back in the next little segment.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.280]  This one's only five minutes long, but I want to talk now with Jim Mars.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:41.840]  Here's the Reuters headline, shooting, contain, tough political rhetoric, protesters parade,
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.800]  a altered photo of President Barack Obama spouting an Adolf Hitler-like mustache, a
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:53.120]  candidate for the Senate, muses about gun remedies, and election results don't go the
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.120]  right way.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:59.280]  Members of Congress are spat on and taunted with racial epithets before casting votes
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.800]  for health care reform bill.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.480]  Turned out that was a lie, by the way.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:10.500]  Welcome to Politics American Style, and they go on and say, better restrict free speech.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.200]  Don't put people on all this Prozac type stuff that they have to put on the insert
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.280]  can cause violent outbursts or suicide.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.280]  Don't lie about WMDs, don't know.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.000]  All of that can continue.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.840]  Just shut us up, and here it is, CBS News, Obama-ying Internet ID for Americans.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.560]  That's the beginning of tracking and taxing everything.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.560]  Jim Mars.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.560]  Yep.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.960]  That seems to be the whole program, and of course the problem is it's always plausible
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.960]  to liability.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:44.760]  So, for instance, at this point, we don't know whether Jared Lee Loughner was truly
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:52.680]  just a nutcase enacted on his own, or if he was part of some sinister conspiracy, if you
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.680]  will.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.240]  That'll all shake out, I guess, in the wash, but of course by the time we finally figure
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:08.160]  out which of those two choices it is, then they'll already be pushing full court for
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.800]  more and more gun control, more and more Internet control, less and less free speech.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.960]  In fact, you know what, Alex, would you agree with me on this?
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:23.800]  I think the answer to all this is the exact opposite of what they're saying.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:29.200]  They're saying we need to restrict free speech, we need to curtail the Internet, we need to,
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.440]  in other words, sit down and shut up, and I say no, it's the exact opposite.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.000]  We need to reveal and lay everything out on the table.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.040]  That's right, because the path the globalists with their social engineering is taking us
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.720]  on is the design collapse of society, and out of that chaos, they then bring total
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.880]  tyranny as their order, as their solution.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.760]  The answer is, like so many shootings that have been stopped by somebody owning a gun,
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.120]  I guarantee you, I have a political rally, or I'm in an event, I got somebody there
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.560]  packing heat, you better believe it quietly.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.160]  The answer is more guns, not less, and it was people physically taking him down that
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.160]  stopped it.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.160]  It took the cops five minutes to get there, which isn't bad, but still, he probably would
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.080]  have killed a hundred people if somebody hadn't tackled him, and what if they'd have had
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.080]  a gun?
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.760]  They could have just blown his head off a lot quicker.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:27.080]  That would put a stop to it right there, and the thing is, absolutely, you know, actually
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:33.000]  it goes back years to when they first were having all these airline hijacking, and people
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  were hijacking aircraft and saying, take me to Cuba, and even back then, I said, you
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.280]  know, instead of shaking everybody down and putting in expensive X-ray machines, and of
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.720]  course, I had no idea at that time that they'd actually be making you strip down and fondling
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.600]  your genitals, and all like that, I mean, even the Nazis didn't have the audacity to
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.400]  try that in a public place, but even back then, I said, you know, why don't they just
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.320]  have us do this with a tray of little Saturday night specials to everybody on the plane,
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.960]  and nobody would dare stand up and say, I'm taking over this plane.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.320]  And for idiots that say it would depressurize the plane, you put what air marshals use,
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:21.760]  shear safety slugs that won't shoot through a plane, but will liquefy somebody's insides.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.240]  They have a lot of punch, but it's only right on impact.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.440]  Yeah, you know, you're not gonna bring down the airplane with that, but then that's kind
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.600]  of pushing it to extreme, but you're absolutely correct.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.120]  If everyone, you think of the old West, okay, and of course, you think of the gunfighter
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.120]  old West.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.120]  Stay there.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.400]  Let's finish this talk on the other side, because you know, Homeland Security is proposing
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.520]  everybody wear a bracelet with a taser in it.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.520]  I'm not kidding.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.520]  We'll be right back with Jim Mars.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.880]  We'll finish up with that thought, and then we're gonna get into more on mind control
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.080]  and more on this demon creature.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:59.920]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:04.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.200]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.520]  allows you to have.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.520]  It's true.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.200]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.560]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.560]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.040]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:35.760]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.560]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.680]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:51.520]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:59.200]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:11.480]  We are on the march.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.560]  The empire is on the run.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:20.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:25.800]  There are literally scores of news articles saying conspiracy theories must be banned.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.000]  That means not believing the government.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.720]  Scientists decades ago said they're mining the sodium fluoride out of rocks that have
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.720]  uranium in it, don't drink the tap water.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.360]  Now it's mainstream news in Texas at the state government with the feds, covered it
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.000]  up for two decades, sourced CBS News Associated Press.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.800]  Well, here it is, I guess I'm a conspiracy theorist, vitriol cited as possible factor
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:56.320]  in Arizona tragedy, the NPR, here's an AP, and the aftermath of Gifford shooting a debate
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.840]  over heated political rhetoric.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:03.520]  Here's another one, Reuters, shooting could tame tough political rhetoric, and it goes
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:09.680]  on and says, oh, somebody spit on congressmen who weren't for the health care bill.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.560]  Turned out that was a hoax.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:16.640]  The point is, nobody has prior restraint on me in my free speech, I'm free.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:21.720]  And now we've got TSA putting their hands down our pants, and putting up telescreens
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:26.400]  in Walmarts and other stores saying, spy on your neighbors, I mean, is every corn field
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.840]  going to have security guards in it?
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:32.720]  I'm going to put on screen a Wired Magazine article two years ago, three years ago, we
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.360]  first found this video from Homeland Security, and Homeland Security had a meeting, they're
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:41.280]  proposing it, they were looking at it, people didn't believe it, well, here's Wired Magazine,
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:47.400]  bad idea, the anti-hijacking safety bracelet, it's what it's called, it's a taser bracelet,
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:53.200]  because it's funny, Jim Mars, author, researcher, best selling author, his latest book is The
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.960]  Trillion Dollar Conspiracy, available at infowars.com, the online video bookstore if you want to get
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:02.800]  it, and he said, next it's going to be like the running man with Swartz and Egger, that's
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:09.000]  actually a Stephen King book, made into the film under another name, a bracelet around
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.960]  our neck that tasered us, and during the break I said, Jim, you haven't heard, they're actually
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:19.360]  proposing that we all wear taser bracelets, I mean, land of the free, home of the brave,
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:24.560]  a total police state, the name of safety, there's never enough cops, there's never enough,
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:29.400]  it was citizens that stopped this guy, a woman when he was putting a new clip in, that grabbed
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:34.600]  the gun away and two men that tackled him, I'm surprised they didn't break his neck,
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:40.880]  but surprisingly, I guess it's a Democratic event, while there wasn't any concealed carry,
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.880]  I guarantee you that was a Republican public event, there'd have been a half dozen people
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.160]  right there who would have blown that guy away, the answer is more guns, not less, I
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:53.200]  mean, look at Chicago, look at New York, they have total gunmans in their city limits, and
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:57.720]  they have the highest crime rates in the country, a lot more home invasions, they don't invade
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:03.400]  your house one tenth as much in Texas or Florida, or Arizona, because then you come in my house,
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.920]  I'm going to kill you, Jim Mars, you're comment on this?
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.920]  Well, absolutely, of course, Alex and I both, we're just good old Texas boys, you know,
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:19.040]  I mean, and I live out here in a kind of a rural area, somebody comes on my property,
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.920]  they better be prepared to quickly announce themselves, say who they are and what their
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:30.040]  business is, because out in rural Texas, it's still totally legal that if somebody's trespassing,
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.980]  you give them a warning, you just take pot shot at them, and we don't have any real
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:38.720]  problems out here, our biggest crimes are burglaries, you know, they're coming rob somebody's
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:43.840]  house when nobody's there, no, I don't recall anything here recently when anybody broke
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.440]  into some occupied house, they just don't do it, that's what happens when you disarm
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.680]  the population, and the criminals know, well, they don't have anything really to worry about
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:10:01.400]  except your fist or baseball bat, so they just do what they want to do, the police agencies
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:07.640]  are overtaxed, and as you said, even though the police response out in Arizona was actually
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.560]  pretty quick, I mean, I think they were on the scene like within five minutes, but still
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:17.200]  five minutes, he could have killed 20, 30 more people in five minutes.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.920]  No kidding, in a matter of minutes, he shot 18 people and what killed, killed six, thank
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:29.320]  God, that woman, did you see the video of the guy who ended up getting shot in Florida
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.080]  over his wife getting fired from the city?
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:35.440]  Oh, in the city council meeting, yeah, and the school board lady hits him in the back
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.600]  of the head with her bag, yeah, yeah, and he just turned a look at her like, what are
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.600]  you doing?
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.400]  Yeah, well, she should have been carrying a revolver in her purse and blown that guy
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.840]  away, and that would have been the end of it, that is the answer to shot him right in
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.840]  the back.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:55.360]  Now, this is a short segment right now, but a longer segment's coming up, but Jim, I want
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:59.840]  to get started on the mind control, because for people that don't know the history of
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.160]  this, we covered that Congress admits it, that he'd made videos about mind control.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:10.960]  A lot of times, people who are under mind control think that they're involved in mind
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:15.760]  control or they're secretly working for the government on a secret mission, that's what
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.400]  he'd been telling friends.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.480]  Now again, the reason this is perfect is that just sounds like a schizophrenic, but in so
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:26.480]  many cases it's turned out, in the case of Sirhan Sirhan, if you just tuned in, folks,
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.080]  I have all the mainstream news articles linked in the article that Paul Joseph Watson wrote,
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:37.960]  Arizona assassin obsessed with mind control, it turns out that the LA police said something
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.680]  was going on, that it was the wrong calendar, a caliber that Sirhan Sirhan hadn't fired
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:43.680]  as much.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.520]  I mean, go over just the RFK assassination alone.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.520]  Okay.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:55.040]  Well, of course, Thomas Noguchi, a world-class grade A number one medical examiner, testified
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.800]  under oath in court that the shot to kill Robert Kennedy was fired into his right mastoid,
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.520]  which is the bone behind your right ear, at a range of no more than three inches.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:10.960]  In other words, the gun barrel was within three inches of the rear of his right ear.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.000]  Well, of course, Sirhan Sirhan never got to within about six feet of him, and that was
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  in front of him.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.200]  Also, Sirhan Sirhan had a gun that only contained six rounds, and yet they were pulling bullets
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:29.280]  out of the cabinets and the door frames, ceiling tiles, all of which disappeared mysteriously
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.280]  itself.
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:33.920]  And the acoustics show less shots than were confirmed, I mean, more shots than what the
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.920]  government had claimed.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.520]  And this was the LA medical examiner saying it was a fraud.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.520]  Right.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.400]  Now, just to step forward a little bit, there was a psychiatrist whose name escapes me at
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.640]  the moment who was treating Sirhan Sirhan in prison and came out publicly and said that
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:55.120]  he exhibited hypnotic blocks, that he, I know the words, he was a program assassin.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.480]  And he was admittedly a program that day, and the lady with the polka dot dress, and
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:04.880]  the drugs and the coffee, and his arm was pinned as the shots were being fired, but
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.880]  it didn't matter.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.880]  They filled RFK full of holes.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:08.880]  That's right.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:15.480]  And interestingly enough, there was a man who was known as the Walking Bible because
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:21.440]  he reportedly had memorized and reversed the Bible, and he dealt in horses, and he was
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.520]  outside the Ambassador Hotel waiting to meet with Sirhan Sirhan, who told him he was going
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.760]  to come in with some money and want to buy a racehorse for him.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:36.680]  And this fellow who was going to sell him the racehorse just happened to be related to the
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.080]  man who shot Governor Wallace.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:45.920]  You see how all of this is intertwined, intertwined, intertwined, it's just...
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.560]  And then it turns out there was an admitted CIA operative.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:55.280]  This has now been mainstream news confirmed who was coming in with Kennedy that day.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.200]  I mean, the list just goes on and on, Jim.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.960]  Yeah, it does.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.960]  It really does.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:10.800]  It's the...you've got guys like Howard Lawnstein was the senator, and Dennis Sweeney walks
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.120]  into his office and shoots him, and then just sits there smiling, waiting on the police
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.120]  to arrive.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:21.280]  And it turns out that Dennis Sweeney had been undergoing psychiatric treatment by Dr. Peter
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:27.160]  Bourne, who was Jimmy Carter's White House physician, who finally got dumped because
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:33.680]  he's writing bad drug scripts, and Peter Bourne and his father, Peter Bourne Sr., all operated
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:40.240]  the mental hospital on the island of Grenada, okay, which reportedly was where they were
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.320]  turning out the CIA brainwashed assassin.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:49.600]  And yet when Maurice Bishop took over and became the leader on the island of Grenada,
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.720]  apparently they were fearful that he was kind of a left-leaning government, and though
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.720]  so they apparently decided, you know, he might blow the whistle on this hospital run
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:00.720]  by the Bourne.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.720]  So what happened?
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:08.800]  We invaded the island of Grenada, ostensibly to rescue students, but interestingly enough
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.440]  where all the troops landed was on the opposite side of the island from where the students
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:17.160]  were, but just happened to be on the side with the mental hospital, and the only real
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.440]  casualties were in the mental hospital on Grenada.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:23.960]  Oops, got rid of another CIA brainwashing operation.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:33.400]  And it's the same history with the shooting of Ronald Reagan, the fatal shooting of, of
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.400]  course, John Lennon.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.480]  I want to talk about that some with Jim Mars on the other side.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.760]  His new book is a New York Times bestseller.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.760]  He's had many.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.480]  It's the trillion-dollar conspiracy.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:50.080]  Powerful information available at infowars.com, and we'll be right back with Jim Mars on the
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.680]  other side to look at those areas that we were just covering.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.360]  I've got some tidbits I want to add dealing with Tim McVeigh.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.880]  Stay with us.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.800]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.000]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.

[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:29.080]  south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:35.080]  I'm looking for America.

[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.200]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.760]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.760]  do you want?
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:15.320]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.800]  Food is your only ammunition.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.040]  How much do you want?
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.120]  When do you want it?
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.040]  Now or after the battle starts.
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.200]  When will you need it?
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.320]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.640]  Will there be any food?
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.120]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.240]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.400]  and be immunized?
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.200]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.800]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.040]  How much will you need?
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.040]  We don't know.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.040]  How much do you want?
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.040]  All you can get.
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.040]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.240]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:05.800]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.520]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.080]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:14.880]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.480]  your health and your own family.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.480]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:21.840]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.280]  You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.080]  owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:31.480]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.520]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.720]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.200]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.840]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:47.080]  He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.560]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:14.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:18.120]  We're back live with Jim Mars, journalist, best-selling author.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.760]  He's going to stay with us a little bit in the next segment because he's got some really
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:29.880]  bombshell information dealing with what happened a month ago with that Chinese missile.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:36.000]  He's even got an admission on CNN and how it ties together with that stalled cruise ship
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.640]  in the same area.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.880]  That's coming up with Jim in the next segment.
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:45.120]  Now, Jim, obviously our hearts and prayers go out that everybody who was injured and
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.880]  killed in their families dealing with this guy.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.940]  But on so many fronts, it just screams mind control.
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:56.640]  But he may just be a, you know, violent schizophrenic dressing up as the grim reaper burning the
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.120]  American flag and praising the communist manifesto, which then the Southern Poverty
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:05.720]  Law Center, big defenders and stuff like that, says that he's a conservative.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.880]  Last time I checked it, man, he was the opposite.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.880]  But I mean, regardless, they're really trying to use this as a political weapon.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.520]  But I wanted to bring up Jolly and West.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:20.000]  He was admittedly in the MKUltra hearings, the number two guy under Dr. Ewing Cameron
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.400]  and you know who they are, but I want you to elaborate.
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:31.040]  And for those that don't know, Dr. Ewing Cameron was the head of the MKUltra program.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.520]  He ran operations in Canada and the U.S.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.320]  They've had history channel specials with young girls.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.880]  They'd get out of foster homes and erase their memories and give them new names for government
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:47.360]  service and the months of LSD, years of audio piped in with psychological compulsions, sex
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.360]  slaves.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:55.160]  I mean, this all came out, Jolly and West, a guy that worked with him, admitted mind
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.800]  control doctor, when McVeigh goes to Denver for the trial, then when he goes to Tarahood,
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:05.400]  Indiana for the years he's there for execution, that's his doctor on record.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:12.440]  I mean, in the newspaper, how dumb do they think we are, Jim Mars?
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:21.760]  Well, exactly, and to add some substance to what you just said, I once talked to Dr.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:29.240]  Julian Mardock, who was the doctor who was caring for Jack Ruby in the South County Jail,
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:35.120]  and he said that towards the end of the summer of 1966, that he had examined Ruby and he
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:36.920]  was perfectly okay.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:40.360]  He said then, the next thing that happened was he showed up one day and they said, well,
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:45.320]  your services are no longer needed, a doctor has come down from Washington and is going
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:51.240]  to take care of Ruby and that turned out to be Dr. Jolly West.
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.240]  Same guy.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.240]  Same guy.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:23:00.640]  And then, a few months later, Ruby smuggles notes out of the South County Jail and says
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:08.760]  they are injecting cancer into him, then a month or two later, the news reports he's
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:15.240]  taken to Parkland Hospital with pneumonia and then about a few weeks later, they said,
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:22.000]  no, it's non-demonious, it's lung cancer and then just about a month later, he's dead.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  They said of lung cancer.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.200]  Now, I had a fellow who attended my courses on the kidney assassination there at the University
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:34.360]  of Texas at Darlington who worked for Southwest Medical School and operated their electron
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:41.280]  microscope and he said that he was commissioned to study Ruby's cancer cells and that they
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:51.440]  were not of the respiratory system but of the intestinal system, the digestive system.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:55.760]  And when he went to his boss and he said, look, the news is reporting that Ruby died
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:59.640]  of lung cancer but these cells show that it was in his digestive system.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:03.440]  His boss, who had been real friendly and had been real nice and he's got real hard
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.640]  nose and cold and said shut up, don't ever say anything about that again.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:10.640]  Well, by the way, as you know, down in New Orleans, I was down there with Ventura investigating
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:18.160]  this, they were testing injectable cancer and now we know most cancer is viral in nature
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:22.320]  and there's been huge Pentagon programs for more than 50 years, the Rockefellers going
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:28.480]  back over 80, testing and developing transmittable cancer and almost every sewer system in the
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:34.440]  world tests positive for communicable SV40, which has caused many of the rare cancers
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.880]  to become very common, which was added to the Dr. Sock Polio vaccine.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:39.880]  Right.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:47.000]  And by the way, while Oswald was in New Orleans in December 1963, he went to the office of
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.920]  the New Orleans District Attorney and met with him, assistant district attorney named
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:56.480]  Edward Gillan, and asked him about LSD, he wanted to know, said he had a supplier and
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:03.120]  he wanted to take some LSD, he'd been experimenting with it and one take it into Mexico and wanted
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.920]  to know if that was legal.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:11.440]  So Lee Harvey Oswald apparently was also on the fringe of this mind control experiment
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.200]  that was going on with the CIA, the military.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:21.400]  Well, it's been declassified that the military gave the LSD in masses in the 50s and 60s
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.400]  to the universities.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.400]  Exactly.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.360]  And that's nothing that most people do not understand.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:31.120]  We all know, or most of the people, especially older folks that grew up, you know, know about
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:37.880]  Timothy Leary and the Drug Revolution of the 60s and the Drug Revolution on the campuses.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:42.480]  But what nobody really knows and has been not only documented, but admitted to by the
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:49.240]  CIA, that there would have been no drug revolution of the 1960s except for the CIA that got a
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:56.040]  total monopoly on the quantity of LSD and informed it out to these universities for
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:02.560]  study to find out if they could make it as a truth serum or as a mind control substance.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:07.000]  And that's what, then all of a sudden, this total thing that was under total control of
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.040]  the CIA is out on all these campuses and then these professors and then their labs and their
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:17.080]  lab assistants and their girlfriends, they all started taking LSD and then they moved
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.080]  on to other stuff.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:23.800]  And that's what started the Drug Revolution of the 1960s, our own government, your tax
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.240]  dollars in action.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.440]  This just out, Pima County Sheriff sets off debate on price of free speech.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:39.440]  They're now blaming free speech for this demonic, schizophrenic demon, whoever he was, and it
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:43.160]  turns out he'd been making all sorts of statements about how he was going to kill everybody for
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.840]  years at college, but nobody stopped him.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.120]  Isn't it funny how they never stop him?
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:55.640]  Isn't it funny, but then, I tell you, or how these government operatives like Hal Turner
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:02.760]  could call for violence for years and not get in trouble, says heightened and vitriolic
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.520]  political rhetoric, what, how the government's destroying our country, is being blamed by
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:14.360]  some for the kind of violence that landed Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords in
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:18.440]  intensive care following a mass casualty shooting on Saturday.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:22.000]  But others say a blame game is hardly appropriate or useful right now.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.360]  Yeah, they're blaming libertarians, conservatives, people that want to audit the Fed.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.200]  This guy had all sorts of ramblings.
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.640]  I mean, he also, of course, wasn't an atheist.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.600]  I mean, let's ban people being atheists.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.120]  He also loved communism.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.680]  I mean, I'm sick of it.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:40.880]  He dressed up like a grim reaper.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.560]  Are we going to ban Halloween costumes now?
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:50.960]  Yeah, you know, you hit a real sore point with me, Alex, in that, you know, they're
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:57.600]  always attacking people like you for simply raising questions and raising your voice and
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:02.160]  questioning what the government doing, why are they doing this, do this, behind all this,
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.200]  which to me falls under free speech.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.520]  And yet the people who for months or years said, I'm going to kill somebody, let's go
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.720]  kill everybody.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.080]  They seem to just slide on through that, you know, that's their free speech.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.840]  Yeah, it's not free speech when you say, I'm going to go kill this person.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.120]  Now it's a terroristic threat.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.560]  Now it's a call to action.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.560]  Listen to the sheriff.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.680]  I think the vitriolic rhetoric that we hear today out from people in the radio business
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.840]  and some on TV business.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:34.480]  He goes on to say that has not because the United States of America that most of us grew
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.480]  up in.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.320]  And I think it's time that we do soul searching, the sheriff said, well, I'm going to say this
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:47.400]  we can directly link real outburst of violence to violence on television, desensitizing people.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.880]  Also the Prozac family of serotonin re uptake inhibitors will get Jim's take on that.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:55.400]  They get into this missile investigation he's been looking into.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:56.840]  This is some incredible info.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:01.040]  Stay with us.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:05.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.640]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.640]  you to have.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:16.640]  It's true.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.320]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:25.640]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:29.640]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:33.160]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:36.880]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:45.400]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:46.800]  One of my oldest sponsors.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:51.040]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.760]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:54.840]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:02.440]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:06.160]  Countries of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:09.320]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.640]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:14.640]  at home.
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.800]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:20.800]  shots.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:25.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:31.080]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:35.720]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:40.120]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.160]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.240]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.240]  of the republic.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:55.600]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right

[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.480]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:11.160]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.320]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:19.920]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:25.200]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:31.480]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:35.800]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:41.120]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:46.400]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:24.520]  submarine within 30 miles of Los Angeles and fired off one of their new type missiles
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:33.480]  that set off an EMP pulse, alright, and according to the Russians as reported by CNN, they said
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:39.880]  this was a test to see if their electromagnetic pulse weapon would work and would be effective
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:45.640]  in that locality and to see what the response time would be of the U.S. military.
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:47.800]  And that was even on CNN, wow.
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:56.440]  Yeah, now, what happened on November, and this missile was about 6 p.m. on Monday, November the 8th.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:04.920]  What happened also on Monday, November the 8th? The giant modern cruise ship Carnival Splendor
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:10.360]  went dead to water. All the engines quit, all the power went off and they couldn't get it back on.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:16.920]  Apparently, victims of the EMP pulse. And how long did it take for the carrier Ronald Reagan
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:24.920]  and the rest of the rescue operations to get out to him? 11 hours. 11 hours, that means a Chinese
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:30.680]  submarine could slip up to our coast, fire off a missile, put MIRV warheads in it, drop nukes on
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:37.080]  about 20 different cities, and then they got 11 hours to escape. It's absolutely incredible.
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:43.400]  And then, just to show that apparently this is still ongoing, is that as you may or may not know,
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:49.000]  on January the 2nd, people down at Padre Island said they saw a missile go off down there.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.400]  And our military down there at the Naval base just said, no, we didn't fire anything off.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:58.680]  And so what? Did they fire another missile? What happened down there? Everybody checked,
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.440]  see if there was any reports of power outages down around Padre Island.
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:05.480]  We're going back to this cruise ship. I looked at the times as well,
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:08.760]  right at the same time. That's when that cruise ship lost all its power.
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:14.520]  Right. And it's still in dry dock because they still hadn't figured out what caused everything
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:18.520]  to shut down. And then they spun it in the media and said, oh, it really wasn't a missile. It was
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:24.120]  a contrail despite the fact that former head rocket engineers at NASA, former Joint Chiefs of Staff
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:29.080]  members, they all came out and said it was a Polaris type submarine launch missile.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:36.360]  Exactly. Exactly. And Brigadier General Jim Cash, who is a former NORAD commander,
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:40.360]  says in my opinion, there's no doubt that what was captured on video was a missile launch.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:49.160]  So look, this is our media. We're almost in a war. And they're telling us it's a contrail.
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:53.400]  This would be like... Oh, but you and the general are conspiracy theorists. Stay there.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.920]  Let's do a few more minutes. The show is almost over, but I want to have you finish up on that
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:05.080]  point, Jim Marsourgas. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:09.880]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:15.240]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:20.520]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:25.240]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:30.040]  food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:34.920]  you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:40.520]  good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:45.880]  you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of

[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:07.720]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:12.680]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:17.960]  power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:22.920]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:28.440]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:33.640]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:38.360]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:42.840]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:47.560]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:19.560]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:31.160]  A frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:57.000]  No amount of martyrs for the establishment. No amount of them funding lunatics or protecting
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.280]  them is going to put this back together again. I want a peaceful restoration of our republic.
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:08.040]  But we've been right about all this stuff. And now it's the London Guardian. It's everybody
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:15.480]  saying talk radio, Sarah Palin. They're blaming David Ike of all people. They're blaming people
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.960]  that support gold as the currency, though the guy wasn't even talking about that. And so what
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:24.600]  have he had? How does that affect me being against the Federal Reserve devaluing our dollar?
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:30.360]  They're desperate to change the subject. You got a better chance being struck by a lightninger,
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:35.480]  dying in a car accident hundreds of times that, a dying from terrorism. Many times better chance
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:39.960]  of dying from a honey bee sting. Over a hundred year die from that than this type of lunacy.
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:45.800]  Okay? And it just shows you who the establishment are, that they want your free speech. And the
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:51.000]  FCC and others have said it. And Obama's trying to pass stuff right now for internet taxes and
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:57.080]  internet tracking everywhere you go. They're not playing games here, folks. And look at Mexico
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:02.360]  with total gunbands on the books. And they've had 30 plus thousand dead now in the last two years.
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:07.960]  A lot of them politicians and police, no free speech really to speak of, no second amendment,
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:14.440]  much more dangerous. You will not take my guns. You will not take my free speech. Do you understand
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:19.560]  that control free criminals that run this government? My founding fathers fought for my rights and my
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:24.600]  liberties. And I'm fighting for them right now. And you're not taking my free speech. Anybody that
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.720]  does is a tyrant. Now you may say the people that stood up against Chalcescu or against Hitler were
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:34.520]  bad. You know, are all governments God? Does anybody have a right to say no? Jim Mars, your
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:41.160]  final take on all of this. Well, I would simply say ask everybody's listening. Get out a piece of
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:47.720]  paper and pencil it. Write down how many times the conspiracy theorists have been right. And then
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:53.160]  write down on another column how many times has the government been caught in a lie? They've lied
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:58.680]  to us and been caught in it. And just see who's been telling you the truth, okay? And this whole
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:04.280]  thing about this missile is fired off the coast of California on November the 8th. I mean,
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:09.560]  obviously the missile. You could see the flame. You could see the spin of the thunder of the
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:16.360]  missile. And now we've gotten several knowledgeable military officers, including Brigadier General
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:22.440]  Jim Cash, who say that was a missile launch. And yet your government, the people you're paying your
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:28.120]  tax money to, they tell you, oh, there's no real threat. And that was done right when Obama was
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:33.080]  meeting with the Chinese leader. I mean, this was a threat because our government have been running
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:37.880]  drills right off their coast. And that was their way of flexing their muscles showing, hey, we got,
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:46.680]  we got weapons too. You can't cow us. And by the way, Russia and China have downgraded the dollar
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:56.360]  from AA to A plus, you know, and they're now only trading with each other in the Chinese currency
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:01.320]  and world bond holders are starting to move in to the Chinese currency away from the dollar.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:06.360]  And our media just says, hey, all of you people that saw that missile trail, forget it. You didn't
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:12.600]  see it. It never happened. Go back to sleep. Well, sleep, you know, I would put it this way.
[01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:19.400]  This would be like when Hitler invaded Poland in September of 1939, starting World War Two,
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:24.840]  our media might have told us, well, there was a traffic jam on the highways in Western Poland
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:30.920]  this morning. Come on, people, wake up and start thinking for yourselves. And let's start shaking
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:36.440]  these zombies to wake around here before it's the before the only thing that is left to us
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:43.080]  is fighting back. Absolutely. We don't need to do that. Absolutely. We're trying to fix things
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:47.400]  peacefully. But every time we turn around or turn a rock over, government or private groups are
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:52.600]  trying to finance violence so they can shut down political debate. But as Kennedy said,
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:59.480]  those that make peaceful, you know, resistance and political action impossible make violent
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:04.360]  revolution inevitable. I'm paraphrasing that. In fact, guys, pull up a Kennedy quote about
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:09.000]  those that make a peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. I forget
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.480]  the exact quote. I want to get it straight. That was the gist of it. Yeah, Jim, I want to thank you
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:19.400]  for coming on a bestselling author of many books. Also, his new book available at info wars.com,
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:23.640]  the trillion dollar conspiracy. Well, we'll talk to you again soon, my friend. Okay. Thank you,
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:29.080]  Alex. Thank you for giving us the time tonight. I love Jim Mars, folks all over the country in
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:34.440]  the world. Listen to two Texans. He's up in DFW. I'm down here in the Capitol, Austin. Love talking
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:39.240]  to Jim love every once in a while, meeting up with him and drinking a beer and smoking a cigar.
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:42.600]  Maybe that's why I don't ever meet up with Jim because he drinks beer and smoke cigars. And then
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:47.880]  I, he's a bad influence on me. I'm just joking, folks. He is a great guy and original type journalist
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:52.680]  for the Fort Worth start telegram on the crime beat and bestselling author researcher. They don't
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:53:00.280]  make them like that anymore. Jim Mars. Okay. I've got some serious things to talk about here in the
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:10.680]  last five, six minutes that we've got left. It is brazen and it is political corruption and
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:18.760]  political prostitution to take the deaths of these people and to hype it up. And one of the hours
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:24.520]  of this shooting say this is because of Sarah Palin, uh, putting crosshairs on the States they
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:28.840]  wanted to take back. That's classic political rhetoric, nothing to do with violence and everybody
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:36.520]  knows it. And it's not fair to just because the guy was a big liberal and pro abortion and an
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:43.560]  atheist to blame abortion lovers or atheist, but the facts are in from all his college friends.
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:50.280]  He was a dope head coming. Okay. It doesn't matter though. They'll say he's George Washington by
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:55.480]  the time they're done. Why? Because the establishment hates anybody that'll actually save this Republic
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:59.080]  because we got a bunch of crooks stealing this country blind. The private, the private
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:04.440]  Federal Reserve won't tell the Congress where the trillions have gone. But I want to put him back
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:14.040]  up on screen. This is the Phoenix times Jared, the lead shooter in Gabriel Giffords attack
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:20.280]  described by classmates as left wing pot head. And I've watched all his videos. I've read with this
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:29.320]  lunatic had to say, and if he had mind control, he is a chip off the old block. But let's not let
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:36.920]  people like this guy. Let's not let this individual be used to destroy our bill of rights, our
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:41.320]  Constitution, our hard one, free speech. This country's in a lot of trouble. It's getting crazier
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:47.000]  and crazier and things are going to get a lot worse. In 1989, Chilchescu had killed hundreds
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.880]  of thousands of his people. He was enslaving them. His secret police raped, robbed and killed
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:57.080]  whoever they wanted. And they had a rally at which he was running it and the police started
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:01.240]  beating up a few people at it. And the crowd started fighting back and he told them sit down
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.480]  and put up with it. And in a few hours, they'd taken the government building over and a few
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:09.560]  hours later, they had a trial for this admitted mass murderer and he was put to death. Now,
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:16.440]  was it wrong for them to put this Marxist mass murderer to death? Our government would say
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:23.240]  yes. Was it wrong for Operation Valkyrie for Germans of the military to try to kill that off
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:29.960]  Hitler? Our government would say yes. Government is to be worshiped. There is no bad government.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:35.800]  Lenin is good. Stalin is good. Hitler is good. Mao Zedong who killed 65 to 80 plus million.
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:39.800]  Chinese government says 80 plus million. That's supposedly you got to put up with and love.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:44.840]  Okay, well, fast forward to the takeover. So there are the people just storming things and
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:51.240]  taking over. Now, if we just had a dictator in this country, revolution like this could be the
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:56.280]  way to go. The problem is Obama's a puppet. Bush is a puppet. All these people are puppets.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.400]  All these members of Congress, some are good, some are bad. Most just aren't informed. This
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:06.120]  lady was pretty good. Pro-Second Amendment, pro-national sovereignty wanted to control our
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:13.800]  border. This white supremacist, it looks like Kilder because he was a left wing Nazi. Marxist.
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:17.960]  That's why he said he loved Mein Kampf. He loved communism. He loved abortions. He loved death.
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:22.200]  He loved stuff he thought was powerful and cool. He loved making scary faces and taking
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:26.920]  photographs. He loved trying to scare girls. He was a punk. We've all seen him.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:33.160]  He didn't get his high and didn't get when he was doing this stuff in high school.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:41.080]  So this is a culture of death with a bunch of nerds who want to go out and use guns to kill
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:45.880]  us. Just like Harrison Clybold and the guy that shot up the Pentagon. Over and over again,
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:51.080]  it's the same MO. Whether they're organically growing them like this or not, or whether it's
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:55.720]  mind control, it's the same thing. He even looks like Harrison Clybold. Those two looked alike.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:57:01.320]  He looks alike. I mean, you want to profile somebody. It's trench coat wearing pibs. And I'm
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:04.920]  not saying everybody likes to wear black's evil, but you know, they think it's powerful. They think
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:11.800]  it's tough. They think it's real cool. Okay. I'll tell you what's tough. It's going on a 25-mile
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:16.120]  hike with a heavy pack. That's what's tough. What's tough is taking care of your family. What's tough
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:21.000]  is saving people out of a burning building as a firefighter. Tough is not dressed up like Count
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:28.040]  Dracula running around trying to scare people. Okay? Any Count Dracula's coming around here,
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:34.520]  I'm going to defend myself. We need guns to protect ourselves from abortion loving atheists
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:39.960]  like this guy. And the fact that the abortion loving eugenicist liberal media is trying to blame
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:45.320]  people like me makes me sick. Okay, we got to take our whole government back. This country's in
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:58:10.680]  trouble because we the people haven't taken it back peacefully.
