[00:00.000 --> 00:17.300]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so
[00:17.300 --> 00:28.460]  does he live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones so
[00:28.460 --> 00:35.180]  ladies and gentlemen we've got another absolutely completely overflowing plate
[00:35.180 --> 00:42.580]  in front of us today the 29th day of January 2018 on this Monday global
[00:42.580 --> 00:47.260]  transmission I am your host Alex Jones and we have got as I said a massively
[00:47.260 --> 00:52.380]  overflowing plate today it's been announced it's up on info wars.com
[00:52.380 --> 00:58.180]  that coming up today at five o'clock we'll be covering it live with Owen
[00:58.180 --> 01:03.380]  shroyer and Roger Stone and myself in the war room house Intel committee voting
[01:03.380 --> 01:09.260]  Monday 5 p.m. to release the memo so we're gonna be breaking all of that down
[01:09.260 --> 01:15.340]  and Trey Gowdy has come out and foreshadowed what's in it exactly what we
[01:15.340 --> 01:19.380]  told you we're gonna play that clip coming up here in just a moment we'll
[01:19.380 --> 01:24.460]  play the full clip later in the hour where it's Obama and it's the Hillary
[01:24.460 --> 01:29.420]  campaign working together to create a fake dossier to get a warrant to then
[01:29.420 --> 01:33.520]  illegally spy on the campaign and then to lie about what they even found in that
[01:33.520 --> 01:39.420]  and all the collusion at the FBI and the secret societies and the insurance
[01:39.420 --> 01:45.340]  policies and all of it showing the interconnected web of command and control
[01:45.340 --> 01:51.740]  here's part of that clip as I discussed with Mark short the Washington Post
[01:51.740 --> 01:56.900]  reports today the president wants to have the memo released do you agree with
[01:56.900 --> 02:06.060]  that I do I'm sorry that we're to this point this memo is nothing but a a the
[02:06.060 --> 02:11.740]  distilling the reducing of thousands of pages of documents provided to us by the
[02:11.740 --> 02:15.180]  department in the bureau so there's nothing in this memo that the
[02:15.180 --> 02:19.860]  department is not already aware of if you think your viewers want to know
[02:19.860 --> 02:23.020]  whether or not the dossier was used in court proceedings whether or not it was
[02:23.020 --> 02:26.700]  vetted before it was used whether or not it's ever been vetted if you are
[02:26.700 --> 02:31.300]  interested in who paid for the dossier if you're interested in Christopher
[02:31.300 --> 02:34.900]  Steel's relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee
[02:34.900 --> 02:40.860]  then yes you'll want the memo to come out if you're Adam Schiff who is
[02:40.860 --> 02:45.380]  consistently wrong when it comes to issues of disclosure he didn't want us
[02:45.380 --> 02:50.560]  to find out any of this information Chris he fought in fact GPS went to court
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.380]  fusion GPS we're gonna get to more of this when we come back from break but
[02:54.380 --> 03:00.260]  just as the epoch times themselves great journalist reverse engineered what is
[03:00.260 --> 03:04.620]  going to be in this memo there you have more confirmation from our congressional
[03:04.620 --> 03:09.660]  sources as we told you two weeks ago and again last week that it is the road map
[03:09.660 --> 03:13.780]  of the fraud and it's how they did it and it's a timeline of it with exhibits
[03:13.780 --> 03:20.500]  for each piece and the core of it is the 99 page FISA report that has excise
[03:20.500 --> 03:24.420]  parts that are in the memo they just shows to call this the secret FISA memo
[03:24.420 --> 03:31.660]  because they're also using that as the roadmap to show the perjury so as I
[03:31.660 --> 03:37.660]  told you two weeks ago and on last Monday it is a compendium of the
[03:37.660 --> 03:41.420]  investigation it is the indictment in the house that's what the house is
[03:41.420 --> 03:45.420]  supposed to do it's the public indictment of these people so there you go
[03:45.420 --> 03:50.780]  next week's news today and then coming up the lowest ratings ever for the
[03:50.780 --> 03:57.580]  Grammys just a wall-to-wall circus of disconnected loons trying to create
[03:57.580 --> 04:02.220]  racism and division in this country and Hillary showing up in the middle of it
[04:02.220 --> 04:10.180]  to promote the fiction book fire and fury one reason why he liked to eat at
[04:10.180 --> 04:15.380]  McDonald's nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made that's
[04:15.380 --> 04:19.380]  it we've got it that's the one you think so oh yeah the Grammys in the bag in the
[04:19.380 --> 04:25.540]  back look at that psycho smile they don't get everyone hates Hillary they don't
[04:25.540 --> 04:33.340]  get this puts them into deeper hot water they don't understand it they just
[04:33.340 --> 04:36.540]  keep pushing and pushing but some of the Democrats do they've been trying to show
[04:36.540 --> 04:39.820]  the Clintons the door for about a year and they won't go away that's why the
[04:39.820 --> 04:45.660]  New York Times came out and fired a giant warning torpedo at Hillary who is a
[04:45.660 --> 04:52.380]  sexual enabler of serious predators will break down what really is the end of
[04:52.380 --> 04:57.020]  the Clintons and their whole crime network when we come back

[06:51.420 --> 06:59.220]  followed by the Maxine Waters or James Brown in drag comedy rebuttal she's
[06:59.220 --> 07:04.020]  gonna be on BET and we're gonna have some of the other comedy rebuttals of
[07:04.020 --> 07:10.740]  other Democrats as well so look forward to that I will be here tomorrow night

[07:21.900 --> 07:25.500]  six we're just gonna extend live coverage right through right through seven
[07:25.500 --> 07:28.700]  o'clock central right through the hour and a half address right up until
[07:28.700 --> 07:33.860]  midnight taking your phone calls so Trump's first state of the union live
[07:33.860 --> 07:38.980]  coverage Tuesday January 30th at 7 p.m. central but it's gonna be ongoing even
[07:38.980 --> 07:42.220]  before that because we've added obviously the war room and the real news and all
[07:42.220 --> 07:47.660]  these other daily transmissions as we promised to do followed by the James
[07:47.660 --> 07:54.100]  Brown comedy rebuttal that we'll be analyzing and carrying from BET so that
[07:54.100 --> 07:58.900]  is all coming up info wars.com forward slash show and many stations across the
[07:58.900 --> 08:03.660]  country and it will be family oriented we will have the delays in place years
[08:03.660 --> 08:07.340]  ago I would do some of these live coverage as they be internet only and I
[08:07.340 --> 08:11.500]  let it let a few potty words through but we've assured our stations and all of
[08:11.500 --> 08:15.700]  our affiliates just like the main info or show that I do for four hours every day
[08:15.700 --> 08:21.140]  that we will have the video and audio delays in place for all of our UHF BHF
[08:21.140 --> 08:26.820]  and cable stations that are picking up the transmission we're becoming big
[08:26.820 --> 08:31.420]  boys now and behaving like we should even though CNN doesn't have to and ABC
[08:31.420 --> 08:36.100]  doesn't have to they all put cuss words sex men having sex you name it on
[08:36.100 --> 08:41.900]  television but if we would show SJW is flipping people off but but but beep the
[08:41.900 --> 08:47.620]  cussing but show the flipping off leftist file complaints see that's not
[08:47.620 --> 08:51.100]  how conservatives or libertarians or patriots are so people ask why don't you
[08:51.100 --> 08:56.340]  cuss like all the other liberal broadcasts do now and it's true on radio
[08:56.340 --> 09:00.940]  stations they're cussing now I hear it locally in Austin they're they're God
[09:00.940 --> 09:06.580]  okay they can do whatever they want plus I've got a large vernacular and I've got
[09:06.580 --> 09:12.340]  a pretty good mental thesaurus and lexicon for my verbal palette and so I
[09:12.340 --> 09:15.980]  really don't need to use those words but sometimes you know you need to call
[09:15.980 --> 09:20.140]  Bill Clinton a sack of you know what and you know sometimes you got to admit
[09:20.140 --> 09:24.860]  that places like Hades are you know what holds we're not putting Haiti down it's
[09:24.860 --> 09:28.100]  stating it's a crap hole a lot of Haitian leaders said absolutely right
[09:28.100 --> 09:33.020]  after we got robbed by the Clintons everybody else it became an even worse
[09:33.020 --> 09:37.660]  one now speaking of that they're going to be releasing I believe they're gonna
[09:37.660 --> 09:40.860]  vote they have the votes so I'm gonna just say it here they're going to vote
[09:40.860 --> 09:47.540]  to release the memo at five o'clock Eastern today four o'clock Central we're
[09:47.540 --> 09:51.860]  gonna be covering it live no longer extended covers we have the war room
[09:51.860 --> 09:55.580]  three hours after Owen shroyer and others will be covering it live today in
[09:55.580 --> 09:59.820]  four wars dot com four slash show the president says he wants it released the
[09:59.820 --> 10:03.980]  president unilaterally can release himself but it's Congress's report that's
[10:03.980 --> 10:07.700]  really what they're calling it a memo but it's a report and so I think that
[10:07.700 --> 10:11.700]  they've got the votes and I think it's gonna happen in fact I'm gonna say
[10:11.700 --> 10:18.180]  they're gonna vote to release that memo today they're not gonna conference with
[10:18.180 --> 10:20.980]  the Justice Department they're gonna play games with sessions so they've
[10:20.980 --> 10:25.820]  definitely got something on they are going to release it big and bold today
[10:25.820 --> 10:30.740]  at four o'clock Central five o'clock Eastern so whether you're a truck driver
[10:30.740 --> 10:34.420]  or somebody listen on an app or local radio station or whatever you can always
[10:34.420 --> 10:41.860]  find the live video feeds info wars dot com four slash show now that said
[10:41.860 --> 10:45.620]  Trey gowdy has come out and told you exactly what I said two weeks ago and
[10:45.620 --> 10:49.140]  what I said on Monday and the the mainstream media said it was fake news
[10:49.140 --> 10:55.740]  and some of the Patriot media jealous that it was fake news we have a ton of
[10:55.740 --> 11:02.740]  congressional sources obviously and most of those sources remain anonymous and I
[11:02.740 --> 11:05.700]  don't just have Roger Stone that has dinner weekly with multiple members of
[11:05.700 --> 11:10.220]  Congress and people that are on these committees we have other sources and we
[11:10.220 --> 11:14.900]  know what's in the memo it's a roadmap of thousands of pages of documents
[11:14.900 --> 11:21.100]  linked up with the FISA court 99 page memo that's about 10% redacted the
[11:21.100 --> 11:26.420]  redacted parts is who ordered it who did it Obama it's all in there DNC's
[11:26.420 --> 11:31.460]  involved you name it and it's all tied in and then shows their perjury to
[11:31.460 --> 11:35.540]  Congress not just the collusion the political manipulation and Trey gowdy
[11:35.540 --> 11:40.580]  has come out and said just that we'll be breaking that down in the next segment
[11:40.580 --> 11:45.580]  but first let's get to how the establishment is in a civil war not
[11:45.580 --> 11:55.020]  just between Patriots not just between the deep state and people that want to
[11:55.020 --> 11:59.340]  make the country great again but you've got a civil war between libertarian
[11:59.340 --> 12:02.900]  constitutional style Republicans against blue blood establishment
[12:02.900 --> 12:05.980]  Republicans and then you've got the Democratic Party that's gotten some
[12:05.980 --> 12:10.900]  savvy people in it that realize the total race war communist narrative that
[12:10.900 --> 12:15.060]  that they want to carry out down the road has been launched too early via
[12:15.060 --> 12:20.780]  hubris and too much confidence and so it's waking people up not bullying them
[12:20.780 --> 12:25.060]  into submission anymore and they've tried to show the Clintons the door over
[12:25.060 --> 12:30.820]  and over and over and over and over and over again and keep bringing out more
[12:30.820 --> 12:36.260]  and more of the scandals but the reflexes at mainstream media are still to
[12:36.260 --> 12:41.980]  defend it's a very schizophrenic fight going on but you see Hillary showing up
[12:41.980 --> 12:48.540]  at the Grammys being part of this hatefest against the president and
[12:48.540 --> 12:53.380]  America's recovery and they're so disconnected then they wonder why I had
[12:53.380 --> 12:57.660]  the lowest ratings ever or why the NFL is falling apart with the lowest ratings
[12:57.660 --> 13:01.460]  ever or why any of this is happening because the economy is coming back
[13:01.460 --> 13:04.780]  because people want to work together they don't want to fight with each other
[13:04.780 --> 13:09.100]  they don't want to be demoralized they don't want to be manipulated they don't
[13:09.100 --> 13:14.540]  want to be controlled anymore they want freedom and and so there's a big turning
[13:14.540 --> 13:19.780]  away from the system right now and because Hillary Clinton doesn't know when
[13:19.780 --> 13:24.940]  to quit because Hillary Clinton doesn't know when to back off the New York
[13:24.940 --> 13:29.260]  Times itself has come out and said Hillary Clinton chose to shield a top
[13:29.260 --> 13:33.980]  advisor accused of harassment in 2008 and these articles are coming out every
[13:33.980 --> 13:40.100]  day she represented men that kidnapped an 11 year old girl and gang raped her
[13:40.100 --> 13:45.900]  broker job knocked one of her eyes in and raped her so hard it crushed her
[13:45.900 --> 13:52.460]  cervix and caused not just a prolapse you want to get graphic but her her guts
[13:52.460 --> 13:57.460]  to start coming out of her okay so these are grown men raping a little girl
[13:57.460 --> 14:01.620]  they grabbed off her bicycle for more than 10 hours at a shotgun shack out in
[14:01.620 --> 14:05.300]  the woods drunk on whiskey and because they were good old boys and part of
[14:05.300 --> 14:09.260]  the establishment that was the first client she had and then it went from
[14:09.260 --> 14:14.220]  there she preferred pedophiles and rapist and scum that's who she supports
[14:14.220 --> 14:19.460]  and you see her only with those people today the Harvey Weinstein's and the
[14:19.460 --> 14:23.900]  rest of these folks and that's what they think of you and your family that's
[14:23.900 --> 14:27.060]  why she's on the Lolita Express with a convicted child rapist it's why our
[14:27.060 --> 14:32.300]  own employees get caught shipping people out of the country and so she has this
[14:32.300 --> 14:37.500]  disgusting performance at the Grammys reading out of the fiction book Fire and
[14:37.500 --> 14:44.140]  Fury about how Trump goes to sleep at 6 30 at night
[14:44.140 --> 14:48.660]  we'll see there's a kernel of truth to that sometimes he may take a 30 minute
[14:48.660 --> 14:53.140]  nap takes a shower about his his habits are well known then he goes back to work
[14:53.140 --> 14:57.180]  for a whole second round but yeah he takes off takes a shower each dinner sits
[14:57.180 --> 15:02.020]  around in a bathrobe for an hour yeah hangs out with his wife and then goes
[15:02.020 --> 15:08.140]  back to work that's what most executive men do they work 12 14 16 hours a day go
[15:08.140 --> 15:11.860]  home see your family couple hours go back to work that's what I do many days
[15:11.860 --> 15:16.740]  but but the point is is that they sit there mixing truth with all these lies
[15:16.740 --> 15:21.140]  and then they wonder why everyone is turning against them they wonder why
[15:21.140 --> 15:24.900]  everybody hates them they wonder why everything they touch turns to garbage
[15:24.900 --> 15:30.980]  but they don't know how to give up so they have this train wreck event at the
[15:30.980 --> 15:36.380]  Grammys I watched some of it last night some of the excerpts and it was the
[15:36.380 --> 15:42.500]  skill of a high school play maybe maybe middle school play with just a bunch of
[15:42.500 --> 15:48.340]  bubbling idiots doing moron skits trying to block the recovery of the country
[15:48.340 --> 15:51.740]  and then pissing all over the veterans and trying to give illegal aliens
[15:51.740 --> 15:56.140]  everything free they're making everybody reject them and Hillary just won't go
[15:56.140 --> 16:02.740]  away stay with us this is Dan billard you the IRS money you can't pay our tax

[20:57.900 --> 21:02.740]  news wars dot com as nationalism and the March for Population expands
[21:02.740 --> 21:07.700]  worldwide we're not just fighting the globalist to retake America here in the
[21:07.700 --> 21:12.340]  United States we are fighting the globalist worldwide and the more
[21:12.340 --> 21:16.060]  countries start pulling on a globalism and getting back to economies based on
[21:16.060 --> 21:20.740]  free market and populism the more competition globalism has because it's
[21:20.740 --> 21:25.820]  authoritarian its command and control so these victories around the world against
[21:25.820 --> 21:30.580]  the globalist unelected systems are victories against authoritarianism just
[21:30.580 --> 21:34.540]  like the victories we had over the Soviet Union and the communist scourge and
[21:34.540 --> 21:38.100]  the victories we had over Hitler it doesn't mean we're perfect it means
[21:38.100 --> 21:42.820]  though that those true evils are being defeated those ideologies are being
[21:42.820 --> 21:47.580]  defeated and the globalist ideology is the ideology that went and put
[21:47.580 --> 21:54.700]  communism into Russia it's on record the very same program now coming up
[21:54.700 --> 22:00.700]  today we're gonna have live coverage of it it's 5 o'clock Eastern 4 o'clock
[22:00.700 --> 22:06.260]  Central House Intel Committee voting today as I told you last week we broke
[22:06.260 --> 22:10.860]  that I was told by members of Congress last Monday to look for next Monday's
[22:10.860 --> 22:15.860]  vote that was then codified over the Friday and now they're going to have
[22:15.860 --> 22:20.620]  the vote today and I only make that point people say oh Jones you're making
[22:20.620 --> 22:24.940]  this stuff up you don't have these sources yeah I do have these sources and
[22:24.940 --> 22:28.980]  again they're like we're not a hundred percent sure but it looks like next
[22:28.980 --> 22:31.740]  Monday and I said they're a hundred percent sure but it looks like next
[22:31.740 --> 22:35.100]  Monday and then five days later on Friday they said it'll be Monday we
[22:35.100 --> 22:41.140]  don't know what time and now today they said five o'clock so again House Intel
[22:41.140 --> 22:46.020]  Committee voting Monday 5 p.m. to release the memo after the legislative branch
[22:46.020 --> 22:49.060]  votes to release the memo it would immediately be given to President
[22:49.060 --> 22:53.860]  Trump's executive branch for his review and approval of public release and so
[22:53.860 --> 23:01.860]  the word is look for it to be released by Tuesday Wednesday is the word because
[23:01.860 --> 23:07.340]  Congress is its own system the president's own DOJ is bucking him saying
[23:07.340 --> 23:11.740]  don't release it but the president's the president and he can declassify
[23:11.740 --> 23:19.700]  anything he wants and the bureaucracy acts like it's the president oh no you
[23:19.700 --> 23:25.740]  can't do that all this is a roadmap of criminality and that's why it's about to
[23:25.740 --> 23:31.660]  come out they're calling it the big ugly and just as I said last week from our
[23:31.660 --> 23:36.740]  sources Alex Alex yes some of what you've gotten that memo that's good
[23:36.740 --> 23:40.220]  you're covering that memo is in this yes that's why we're calling it the
[23:40.220 --> 23:43.340]  secret Pfizer memo there are secret sections it's the roadmap of the
[23:43.340 --> 23:47.780]  perjury and it's going to tie into everything and and how the Democratic
[23:47.780 --> 23:52.140]  Party and Hillary was working with Obama and the Justice Department the FBI and
[23:52.140 --> 23:56.100]  then the media to leak false leaks and now that was illegal and it's a roadmap
[23:56.100 --> 24:00.220]  of the year and a half of this garbage going on that's what I said last week
[24:00.220 --> 24:04.980]  from our sources here is Trey Gowdy last night on Mr. Wallace's program on Fox
[24:04.980 --> 24:10.780]  News as I discussed with Mark Short the Washington Post reports today the
[24:10.780 --> 24:18.180]  president wants to have the memo released do you agree with that I do I'm
[24:18.180 --> 24:26.180]  sorry that we're to this point this memo is nothing but a the distilling the
[24:26.180 --> 24:29.940]  reducing of thousands of pages of documents provided to us by the
[24:29.940 --> 24:33.900]  department and the bureau so there's nothing in this memo that the department
[24:33.900 --> 24:38.620]  is not already aware of if you think your viewers want to know whether or not
[24:38.620 --> 24:41.660]  the dossier was used in court proceedings whether or not it was vetted
[24:41.660 --> 24:45.700]  before it was used whether or not it's ever been vetted if you are interested
[24:45.700 --> 24:49.900]  in who paid for the dossier if you're interested in Christopher Steele's
[24:49.900 --> 24:53.700]  relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee then
[24:53.700 --> 25:00.180]  yes you'll want the memo to come out if you're Adam Schiff who is consistently
[25:00.180 --> 25:04.100]  wrong when it comes to issues of disclosure he didn't want us to find out
[25:04.100 --> 25:09.580]  any of this information Chris he fought in fact GPS went to court fusion GPS
[25:09.580 --> 25:13.740]  went to court to keep us from finding out that the Democrats paid for the dossier
[25:13.740 --> 25:17.500]  so if you're Adam Schiff of course you don't want the information to come out
[25:17.500 --> 25:22.100]  you didn't want us to find it in the first place this memo answers what I
[25:22.100 --> 25:26.820]  think are really legitimate questions and I do think the FBI should look at and
[25:26.820 --> 25:32.140]  also the just department paid at least two million dollars that's confirmed but
[25:32.140 --> 25:35.780]  you read media reports fake news and they go oh and there was no money paid
[25:35.780 --> 25:39.340]  because that right there is super illegal especially as it was going to
[25:39.340 --> 25:44.460]  their own family members so that's right just department FBI agents had money
[25:44.460 --> 25:48.500]  going to their wives and husbands that worked at fusion GPS who were just hired
[25:48.500 --> 25:52.620]  on to create the dossier obviously with the information that they wanted the
[25:52.620 --> 25:56.620]  dossier the made-up garbage being conduited over from the just department
[25:56.620 --> 26:02.580]  FBI to be added on to the compendium of opposition research that have been
[26:02.580 --> 26:08.380]  started by the Bush's and the globalist going back two years before that so you
[26:08.380 --> 26:12.300]  really get a bird's-eye view into how this whole thing works behind the scenes
[26:12.300 --> 26:17.140]  let's go back to Mr. Gowdy before before it is released and I have provided
[26:17.140 --> 26:21.300]  that counsel to chair Manunas and I think that he has taken that under
[26:21.300 --> 26:24.580]  advisement so I want to play face-up poker I want the bureau to know
[26:24.580 --> 26:28.780]  everything that's in the memo I think you'll be surprised it is not a hit piece
[26:28.780 --> 26:32.900]  on the department and the FBI I would not have participated in it that's what
[26:32.900 --> 26:37.140]  it was let me let me pick up on this because the reports are and you kind of
[26:37.140 --> 26:41.780]  indicated that in your answer that the memo centers on this question of the
[26:41.780 --> 26:48.340]  FISA application the Department of Justice FBI application in 2016 for a
[26:48.340 --> 26:52.020]  warrant to conduct an electronic surveillance against this fellow then
[26:52.020 --> 26:58.220]  Trump campaign manager Carter paid your complaint according to reports is that
[26:58.220 --> 27:03.060]  you say that when they made that application they didn't talk about the
[27:03.060 --> 27:08.100]  the role of the Russia dossier and especially the fact that was opposition
[27:08.100 --> 27:11.940]  research paid for by the Clinton campaign the Democrats and yes Adam Schiff
[27:11.940 --> 27:16.460]  is leading the charge say you're cherry-picking the information one that
[27:16.460 --> 27:21.060]  the FISA warrant on it Carter paid is not as central as you're making it and
[27:21.060 --> 27:25.740]  two that there was a lot more in the application than just the dossier that
[27:25.740 --> 27:33.540]  the FBI did not rely just on the dossier to get the warrant well I can't even
[27:33.540 --> 27:37.340]  confirm for you that there is a FISA warrant and I can't confirm for you who
[27:37.340 --> 27:40.740]  it's on because that is classified and I'm not going to disseminate classified
[27:40.740 --> 27:44.280]  information I'll just ask you again are you interested in whether or not the
[27:44.280 --> 27:49.340]  world's premier law enforcement agency relied on a work product produced paid
[27:49.340 --> 27:55.940]  for by the Democrat National Committee are now again and the the report put out
[27:55.940 --> 28:00.500]  by FISA court says some of this stuff she legal and they went back and told
[28:00.500 --> 28:04.980]  Obama that that's the memo and the blacked out parts are who ordered it and
[28:04.980 --> 28:08.900]  those people have told Congress they didn't order it that's perjury that's
[28:08.900 --> 28:13.580]  what Gowdy saying he can't tell you the secret parts and then they play the
[28:13.580 --> 28:20.300]  semantical game where they go oh you know we don't even know if you've got a
[28:20.300 --> 28:24.220]  FISA warrant or wherever when it's on record it's there he's just saying the
[28:24.220 --> 28:30.860]  exact specifics of it so if you want to understand it's all right there and it's
[28:30.860 --> 28:37.420]  a roadmap to their perjury and all of their incredible lies I want to go oh
[28:37.420 --> 28:41.020]  the thing for Carter page that's just Carter page he's not important when you
[28:41.020 --> 28:45.980]  get the memo when you get the warrant it's the excuse to drag net those big
[28:45.980 --> 28:50.740]  telecom hubs and spy on everybody and that's in the declassified parts of the
[28:50.740 --> 28:54.900]  memo that's hiding in plain view ladies and gentlemen but they think you're too
[28:54.900 --> 28:59.820]  stupid to understand what the former head of the NSA told you hello I'm Mike

[33:34.860 --> 33:40.100]  got a congressman very close to the entire investigation and the memo
[33:40.100 --> 33:43.780]  joining us today I'm just gonna leave it at that till they join us because we're
[33:43.780 --> 33:47.740]  still lining up some of that congressman's office we've been in touch
[33:47.740 --> 33:52.500]  with I'm working with and working with via Stone and others so that's coming up
[33:52.500 --> 33:59.220]  this just in he was gonna leave in six months so he could get his full
[33:59.220 --> 34:07.500]  retirement but FBI director Andrew McCabe frequent target of Trump's ire
[34:07.500 --> 34:13.940]  steps down he is the acting director NBC News no he has been caught as the man
[34:13.940 --> 34:20.500]  quarterbacking commanding, captaining, generaling, field-martialing,
[34:20.500 --> 34:30.420]  haunchowing, controlling, mastering the entire fake dossier and the group the
[34:30.420 --> 34:35.620]  secret society the insurance policy organization inside running the
[34:35.620 --> 34:39.860]  ridiculous Russia gate program that we all laugh at but they are intending to
[34:39.860 --> 34:46.220]  take the president out and kill the recovery with this this this this thing
[34:46.220 --> 34:53.060]  this fiction made up by John Podesta and Hillary Clinton so this is a big big
[34:53.060 --> 34:58.500]  deal FBI director Andrew McCabe said a month ago that he's gonna take his time
[34:58.500 --> 35:03.620]  and leave in six months you're gone because you know what's in that memo
[35:03.620 --> 35:12.580]  buster your name is blacked out and so is Obama's name and then we've got the
[35:12.580 --> 35:15.820]  memos in between you and the Democratic National Committee and the New York
[35:15.820 --> 35:19.540]  Times I mean that's even in what's been released I mean here's the whole map of
[35:19.540 --> 35:24.780]  it you're watching on TV this is all coming up in just a moment by the way
[35:24.780 --> 35:28.180]  I am so excited that I don't even really want to say this on air because
[35:28.180 --> 35:33.300]  everybody knows I don't hype stuff unless it's really hype worthy we've
[35:33.300 --> 35:40.820]  always been working to get on UHF and VHF stations and some cable systems but
[35:40.820 --> 35:43.700]  but we've mainly focused on getting on AM and FM stations and we've had some
[35:43.700 --> 35:49.100]  pretty big success being the largest independent radio show in the country but
[35:49.100 --> 35:54.860]  I don't know what's going on but I guess our time has come but three or four
[35:54.860 --> 35:59.260]  years ago I got a good satellite but it wasn't the exact right satellite and
[35:59.260 --> 36:05.260]  it's not exactly what all the stations wanted this week I'm signing three deals
[36:05.260 --> 36:10.820]  what I done it last week but the main guy over this had the flu last week CJ to
[36:10.820 --> 36:15.100]  have three different satellites that are what the stations across the country
[36:15.100 --> 36:18.340]  are asking for and let me explain something the owners and managers of
[36:18.340 --> 36:25.380]  these stations are sick of what's going on and they're wanting to pick us up two
[36:25.380 --> 36:29.540]  hours three hours six hours ten hours they know it's going to be spectacular
[36:29.540 --> 36:34.940]  publicity as well but there's also a glut of UHF VHF and cable and he got all
[36:34.940 --> 36:39.940]  the all the channels Beck went and again spent 25 million a year just on a channel
[36:39.940 --> 36:44.100]  for himself of vanity exercise because you got tens of thousands of channels
[36:44.100 --> 36:47.900]  that's nothing if you don't have carriage rides and if you're not low on the
[36:47.900 --> 36:53.780]  tier in the first hundred channels that's why I had a plan three years ago
[36:53.780 --> 36:59.900]  to start targeting UHF VHF and cable but I didn't never really promoted or got
[36:59.900 --> 37:04.660]  it all launched as I was hiring people building studios we got like 20 something
[37:04.660 --> 37:08.660]  or more TV stations another 12 or so cable systems I know of but now I'm
[37:08.660 --> 37:13.100]  starting to get calls from people all over Hollywood folks you name it going
[37:13.100 --> 37:18.180]  man I'm in like Louisiana or I'm in New York or I'm in Minnesota and I'm turning
[37:18.180 --> 37:24.380]  on cable and you're on you know the local NBC channel like your whole show and
[37:24.380 --> 37:27.940]  then I call the station they go yeah we're picking you up you said you're
[37:27.940 --> 37:32.500]  free to air beautiful beautiful but we're getting rid of that satellite in a
[37:32.500 --> 37:35.860]  month and we're getting three new ones so I gotta let everybody know about those
[37:35.860 --> 37:39.500]  and that's what we're doing here just a report to you now that's why they're
[37:39.500 --> 37:43.940]  coming after us and I'm not it I'm not able to tell you about some of the
[37:43.940 --> 37:47.740]  behind-the-scenes stuff yet I'm looking forward to it but we've had some big
[37:47.740 --> 37:50.420]  victories against the globalist and caught them in some really serious
[37:50.420 --> 37:55.540]  things and I mean you don't just think Hillary and Soros and all these people
[37:55.540 --> 37:58.340]  attack me every day in the news and have congressional hearings saying shut me
[37:58.340 --> 38:02.900]  down you don't think they're not trying stuff behind the scenes right the good
[38:02.900 --> 38:07.500]  news is there's not just good in the world there's not just evil in the
[38:07.500 --> 38:11.720]  world there's not just people that are apathetic in the world there's God in
[38:11.720 --> 38:15.900]  the world and there's providence in the world and because there are good people
[38:15.900 --> 38:23.140]  that resonate with God's overall vision and plan we've got providence so not
[38:23.140 --> 38:26.300]  just good there's not just bad there's not just apathetic there's not just the
[38:26.300 --> 38:30.440]  ugly there's not just the strong there's not just the weak there's
[38:30.440 --> 38:36.200]  God and we forget that on this planet in deep space. There is a power that built us, obviously
[38:36.200 --> 38:39.880]  created us. Anyone who's tuned into reality knows it. Anyone who's studied history knows
[38:39.880 --> 38:44.520]  it. All these genetic engineers and scientists who are atheist, the more they study the universe,
[38:44.520 --> 38:49.000]  they go, okay, there is a God and there's some giant dimensional warp gate holding everything
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.120]  together that's thousands of times stronger than this dimension. And there you go. So,
[38:56.120 --> 39:06.120]  amazing things are happening and the globalists are really pissed off because they know that a lot
[39:06.120 --> 39:11.800]  of station managers and station owners and people that own cable systems, TV stations and radio
[39:11.800 --> 39:17.480]  stations are just going, you know what? Alex Jones is right. He's been under attack all these years.
[39:18.040 --> 39:21.800]  And if they can shut him down, they can shut us all down. And people are just saying,
[39:21.800 --> 39:26.280]  we're tired of being intimidated. We're tired of being bullied. We're going to put Alex Jones,
[39:26.280 --> 39:32.200]  David Knight, Owen Schreuer, Paul Joseph Watson, you name it, on the air. And it's happening.
[39:33.320 --> 39:39.320]  And if you want the scholarly focus, you know, low key, very listenable, you got David Knight.
[39:39.320 --> 39:44.040]  You want Alex Jones, fire breathing creature, you got this. You want Owen Schreuer with, you know,
[39:44.040 --> 39:47.880]  the funny stuff he does and the smarts and all the great guests. We're here and we're going to add
[39:47.880 --> 39:52.280]  more shows and more broadcasts and we're going to go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[39:53.560 --> 39:58.600]  Quoting Winston Churchill, they stormed a restaurant named after him in London and the
[39:58.600 --> 40:04.200]  leftists demanded that it be, the name be changed and all this other stuff. They capitulate.
[40:05.720 --> 40:08.760]  And again, that's what it's all about. The endless bullying is time to stop
[40:09.480 --> 40:13.800]  giving in to the bullying of these people. So that's coming up. Now, that said, we need to
[40:13.800 --> 40:18.680]  fund our operation. You hear sponsors for the local stations, you hear them for the radio network
[40:18.680 --> 40:22.520]  GCN. I'm still on GCN because it's good to have a backup and I'm a loyal guy, but, you know,
[40:22.520 --> 40:27.400]  I run my own network, my own operation here, but they fund themselves. I fund myself. We sell
[40:27.400 --> 40:31.960]  products directly to you that they ridicule, they attack, they try to defeat, they try to test,
[40:31.960 --> 40:35.800]  and it blows up in their face. And when you purchase books, t-shirts, videos,
[40:35.800 --> 40:39.080]  you name it, it makes it all possible, but you're going to forget to buy the next time.
[40:39.080 --> 40:46.040]  You need the high quality supplements we have. And if you'll simply go there and test out the
[40:46.040 --> 40:50.440]  supplements, find out the ones you like, and then sign up for auto ship, you'll get an additional
[40:50.440 --> 40:57.560]  10% off and sign up every 15 days, every 30 days, every 60, every 90, up to every year. You can,
[40:57.560 --> 41:01.320]  you know, order where every year you get sent something. Maybe it's an air filtration system,
[41:01.320 --> 41:05.640]  not that you need to get one every year. The point is, is that whatever's perishable, whatever is
[41:05.640 --> 41:10.360]  a renewable, whatever it is that you're going to want to reorder, infowarstore.com,
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.960]  or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And if you'll just commit to get great
[41:15.960 --> 41:21.320]  products at low prices with us and shop with the good guys, it sets off a chain reaction.
[41:22.600 --> 41:29.720]  And so again, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one,
[41:29.720 --> 41:34.360]  three, nine. We're starting to see the orders rolling in. People say they're listening and
[41:34.360 --> 41:39.240]  watching on TV stations. I mean, it's just, it's without us even pushing it, it's just exploding.
[41:39.240 --> 41:45.640]  So praise God, the cavalry's coming over the ridge here. And so for all the censorship online
[41:45.640 --> 41:50.120]  and the stuff they've done trying to destroy us, they're not suppressing the signal,
[41:50.120 --> 41:54.280]  thanks to you out there. I want to thank God. I want to thank my family. I want to thank this crew.
[41:54.280 --> 42:01.560]  I want to thank the audience. I am so humbled by you. You know, I found out they've got big
[42:01.560 --> 42:07.320]  publications going around trying to find people to lie and say that I don't believe what I say
[42:07.320 --> 42:13.000]  and that I don't like my audience. Again, don't believe what I say. We're building what we've
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.560]  talked about. We're turning it around. We're doing it. That's the proof of believing something.
[42:18.280 --> 42:23.240]  I'm 110% committed to this and you know it. And when you fund us, they can't stop us.
[42:24.200 --> 42:30.600]  infowarsstore.com. Now we have introducing the new special, the info wars life, mind and body

[47:11.160 --> 47:28.200]  Live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:31.160 --> 47:36.120]  Ladies and gentlemen we are back live beaming out to radio and tv stations all across the
[47:36.120 --> 47:42.360]  United States and blasting out in the face of massive headwind and censorship but winning
[47:42.360 --> 47:48.040]  like salmon swimming upstream and winning we are breaking through the electronic Berlin wall
[47:48.040 --> 47:54.440]  of google facebook twitter you name it as the president moves to break up those monopolies
[47:54.440 --> 48:00.520]  in year two. We are striking back so be part of coming in for the big win ladies and gentlemen.
[48:00.520 --> 48:09.400]  We have a very clear picture now of Andrew McCabe deputy director acting director after
[48:09.400 --> 48:14.600]  coming was fired who played the part of a friend of the president of someone that cared about him
[48:14.600 --> 48:21.320]  that thought the russia gate was totally fake um that everything was going to be fine and we now
[48:21.320 --> 48:26.840]  know from rents previous uh who has been interviewed for a book and i don't just believe previous i
[48:26.840 --> 48:33.160]  have this from all the other sources that mccabe was along with bannon of course a double dealer
[48:33.160 --> 48:40.200]  but nothing compared to mccabe the main leaker in the meetings with the president on russia gate
[48:41.160 --> 48:44.600]  then going out and lying about what even happened in the meetings remember
[48:45.240 --> 48:50.200]  comey lied and said he didn't give the press the memo his memo about meeting with the president
[48:50.200 --> 48:56.040]  but he did that's lying to congress so the federalist reports a new book mccabe initiated
[48:56.040 --> 49:02.280]  winehouse meeting that led to leak these were meetings about stopping leaks so imagine that's
[49:02.280 --> 49:09.800]  why the president said okay i nominate andrew mccabe because he knows i'm a good guy he knows
[49:09.800 --> 49:15.240]  this is all bull he tells me he's aware there's a cabal inside the justice department and fbi
[49:15.240 --> 49:19.400]  that's all in the new book there's mccabe sir there is you're right we're gonna stop them
[49:19.400 --> 49:28.600]  and this is the best part mccabe ran it can you imagine that's like hitler cut his mustache off
[49:28.600 --> 49:36.200]  you know dies his hair blonde or something and he's like in there with uh i guess general eisenhower
[49:36.200 --> 49:42.360]  going sure we're gonna help you defeat the nazis inside the command base uh there in london and
[49:42.360 --> 49:49.560]  Churchill comes in on his cane really he's like yes uh what's your name oh my name is bob jones sure
[49:49.560 --> 49:54.200]  i have a german accent oh no you're being paranoid uh you kind of look like hitler oh that's even
[49:54.200 --> 50:04.440]  crazier imagine that's like lex luther inside superman's base telling him he's lois lane i mean
[50:04.440 --> 50:10.840]  you've got mccabe who in in the memos in the documents in the text messages is running the
[50:10.840 --> 50:16.360]  whole operation for coming under him of course he is he's a protege of muhler and coming and a
[50:16.360 --> 50:22.280]  minion of the clinton's and and his wife got a half million dollars directly just from hillary
[50:24.200 --> 50:28.760]  boom didn't even spend it on her campaign reportedly just kept it that's the whole another
[50:28.760 --> 50:35.800]  subject for criminal investigation so after he got caught comey admitted to leaking because he
[50:35.800 --> 50:39.720]  wanted to be the one that came out on so he'd already lied that way it was like he was setting
[50:39.720 --> 50:46.120]  the record straight that's why they say truth stranger than fiction right now because i'm going
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.840]  to say this again prebus has now come out he's being interviewed for a book well we can read
[50:50.840 --> 50:56.600]  through it here for you in a moment howard curts his new book on the just the press in general
[50:56.600 --> 51:02.200]  and it confirms what we already knew imagine how mad truck must be he's in meetings almost every
[51:02.200 --> 51:13.240]  couple days with the head of the fbi mccabe and the guy is there lying to him to his face while he
[51:13.240 --> 51:18.760]  runs it and i already said that three times i'm sitting in mccabe ran the criminal conspiracy
[51:18.760 --> 51:24.120]  and it is criminal we've got the memos we got the documents it's totally illegal to defraud the voters
[51:24.120 --> 51:29.560]  of america and our election major civil rights violation you've got all the fraudulent documents
[51:29.560 --> 51:35.240]  they were paying for wiring money to pay for it that's wire fraud lying to congress lying to the
[51:35.240 --> 51:44.600]  president lying under oath mewler comey mccabe all of them and again they go oh you're besmirching
[51:44.600 --> 51:51.400]  the fbi look the fbi has had its issues okay but obviously your local rank and file traditionally
[51:51.400 --> 51:55.800]  and i've known some of them are out doing real jobs and working hard but this this is what's
[51:55.800 --> 52:00.760]  destroying the fbi these people are a criminal group that got control it happens in companies it
[52:00.760 --> 52:07.080]  happens in corporations it happens in families it happens and bad people have gotten control
[52:07.080 --> 52:12.040]  they were so arrogant they thought she'd win once trump won they'd already committed so many crimes
[52:12.040 --> 52:16.920]  they were cornered rats they were committed they couldn't do anything anymore but try
[52:17.560 --> 52:22.280]  desperately with hollywood and with the media to just bring this president down
[52:22.280 --> 52:31.880]  but now ladies and gentlemen we are a year and seven eight days into the recovery because
[52:31.880 --> 52:36.520]  the globalist again had us held underwater trump just pulled him off of us like man this
[52:36.520 --> 52:40.760]  is magic you're like listen i just got him off you come on more coming we got to fight
[52:40.760 --> 52:45.960]  that's where we're at right now trump and the american people waking up we just got the bully
[52:45.960 --> 52:51.480]  off of us but we're bloody we're kind of stumbling around but so's the bully it's time to attack
[52:51.480 --> 52:55.880]  ladies and gentlemen or they could win still and that's why they're fighting so hard man they're
[52:55.880 --> 53:00.440]  putting their full power in and the average conservative or libertarians kind of like oh
[53:00.440 --> 53:04.040]  we beat them they're a bunch of idiots look at the nfl look at the grammy's look at the oscars
[53:04.040 --> 53:09.240]  what a bunch of morons those are just the camp followers and the pr people behind it are very
[53:09.240 --> 53:15.880]  serious people like phil mud who to signal strength to the flagging criminal networks and stay behind
[53:15.880 --> 53:21.640]  networks goes on tv the same week as the former ci director and the former director of national
[53:21.640 --> 53:28.360]  intelligence and they say the president will be gone in two months extra judicially we're
[53:28.360 --> 53:35.480]  not talking impeachment and then well blitzer says you mean not impeachment not well how they go
[53:35.480 --> 53:41.640]  you'll see and blitzer gets scared and then two days later mud goes on tv and says we're gonna
[53:41.640 --> 53:47.640]  kill him that was a telegraph to their criminal network that was scared already already been
[53:47.640 --> 53:52.440]  counter surveilled already being caught we now know six months ago and they're like in the text
[53:52.440 --> 53:58.200]  why she says this isn't gonna work strax telling the superiors we gotta stop there's nothing here
[53:58.200 --> 54:07.560]  they're on to us keep going full power ramming speed that's what happened think about the magnitude
[54:07.560 --> 54:11.400]  of that because these texts are coming out and a bunch more coming out this week they're gonna
[54:11.400 --> 54:16.360]  vote to release it today then it goes to the president couple days he's gonna release it and
[54:16.360 --> 54:22.680]  this is the time just like they had the former deputy national security agency you know michael
[54:22.680 --> 54:28.920]  hastings wife she only shows up at special times she showed up last week and said if you release
[54:28.920 --> 54:34.600]  this memo you're gonna cause a massacre and then suddenly other shows said a massacre a massacre
[54:34.600 --> 54:40.520]  a massacre and they go what do you mean oh congress might get blown up so now they're from saying
[54:40.520 --> 54:46.920]  we're strong we'll kill the president on tv as a signal well gosh golly they're on tv saying

[55:00.920 --> 55:06.840]  this is crazy this is i don't want to be part of this and they ran to congress uh and i can tell you
[55:06.840 --> 55:14.360]  that because it's not just informants it's fbi agents who were involved in it because they're
[55:14.360 --> 55:18.840]  not stupid they know even if they overthrew trump and could arrest all of us and brought in martial
[55:18.840 --> 55:25.400]  law they're gonna kill the globalists are gonna kill every single trader like young strome who helped

[55:44.440 --> 55:49.880]  and trump didn't back off and they pulled off vegas and then about 5 000 people got hung up by their
[55:49.880 --> 55:57.560]  feet a couple weeks later so trump went and showed up in their face and said we're gonna
[55:57.560 --> 56:03.000]  basically bring you down just like that roll over and they rolled over these people are all arrested

[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:16.200]  global is going to go next you just saw that a new books coming out with interviews with people
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:26.760]  inside the white house media madness by Howard Kurtz where mccabe was assuring the president
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:33.240]  that he was investigating the fake dossier and the fraud and the leaks and then he was the main
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:40.680]  leaker and it's now confirmed well of course comey said he wasn't leaking and then had to admit
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:47.080]  and then had to admit he was leaking it's just incredible the bravada but it's not bravada now
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:53.560]  that they were full of hubris and arrogance and the rest of it previously and and and delusions
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.800]  of grandeur as if they actually created this country when they just hijacked it
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:08.280]  and now they're panicking because they are cornered rodents and nothing they do
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:13.800]  can turn it around anymore and so the house of cars is imploding and you can see the signs now every
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:20.840]  day want to play that grammy clip when we come up the next segment but let's look at this right now

[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:39.000]  diversion to claim that i retracted it when i was the one saying it's a diversion from the
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.120]  real stuff like podesta's brother tony podesta in the washington post in 2007 back when they

[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:21.080]  from the front lines of the info war well i told you two weeks ago and i told you again last week
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:24.920]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.760]  We have to tell you when we've been right, when people try to spend it and say we've
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.760]  been lying.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.720]  Now, I never lie.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.800]  But I do get things wrong sometimes.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.680]  And all the time I correct myself, it's usually some date or some name I get wrong.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.080]  Because I go teleprompter free.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:42.960]  But I mean, I'm talking to members of Congress, I'm talking to their aides.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:50.000]  I'm talking to media, people high up in Fox News, and high up in other channels I'm not
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.600]  going to name because it'd be too specific if I did, I'll just stop right there.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.520]  And they obviously want to know what's in that memo.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:04.920]  And I was told, yes, Alex, yes, this was one of the other conversations, I had others
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:05.920]  weeks before.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:10.720]  But I had conversations last week on Monday when we were leased, because it was already
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:17.480]  public but had gotten no attention, that redacted the classified version of the 99-page report
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.280]  by the FISA court about criminal activities.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:25.160]  They were asked to engage in that they rebutted three times in the document.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:28.000]  And they say this is illegal.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.240]  But what's blacked out as the names of who did it, what they told them to do, what their
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:38.840]  arguments were, that is the roadmap for all the other documents they've got.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:44.360]  And I was told, we're just calling it the secret FISA memo because it's all about FISA
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:51.200]  and how illegal made-up information was used to obtain this, Alex.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:56.040]  And then it goes into how the just department with the FBI through Obama linked up on the
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:01.480]  other side of the Democratic Party and Hillary, and then below that how the mainstream media
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.480]  went along with it.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.120]  And Epoch Times reverse engineered this as well a week ago.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.440]  Now, here's that graphic I've been showing so much.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:11.760]  Over on the left, you've got Hillary and the Democratic Party and their operatives.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:16.840]  And you've got the just department and the FBI and Comey, and you've got Obama and all
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.360]  the rest of them over here putting the orders on through Loretta Lynch and others to end
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.400]  up spying on Flynn and everybody else.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.680]  And then you've got that flowing downwards, you've got the media then all involved in
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.760]  regurgitating and in making it all look legitimate.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.760]  And so that's what I was told.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.800]  Yes, Alex, no, it's not fake news.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.800]  Jack Busovic also talked to a congressman.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.120]  They said, no, that is part of it.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:43.360]  That memo, the excise parts is the core of it.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.760]  But it's the core because it shows that the court thought it was illegal three times and
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:54.880]  rebutted it until finally it came down from the president, you're going to do this.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.000]  Yes, sir, Mr. President.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.520]  That's why they say this is going to embarrass the president so much.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.160]  So we've told you what's in the memo.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:08.320]  The media plays games and, you know, Jones claims, I mean, just two weeks ago, they were
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:13.000]  saying there isn't a memo or that Nunes had invented his smoking gun.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  That's what they do.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  They first say it doesn't exist.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.200]  Then they go, oh, Jones got it wrong.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:24.760]  He said he released all the secret memo when he released another secret FISA memorandum,
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.880]  which means memo when William Benny said, hey, I got a call.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.880]  This has been out.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.760]  No one's giving any attention, and I said, who gave me the call?
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:34.760]  This is all fair.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.920]  And he said, Alex, you know, obviously started laughing and goes, yeah, no, people, people
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.280]  want us to talk about this today.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:46.400]  And he's the former director of operations for the NSA, you know, the guy that actually
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400]  runs it.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:53.800]  You've got a political head, but number two at the NSA, famous guy, top analyst, you
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.800]  name it.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.760]  And he's saying, no, this is what they're talking about.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.000]  The fact that the director of national intelligence released this shows that Trump wants this out.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.840]  It's a very positive sign that Trump is against this.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.840]  Oh, what is the former head of operations of the NSA?
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.840]  No.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:14.760]  Well, I don't normally play a clip twice, but I want to play at least the intro.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:21.800]  I played the whole thing earlier of Craig Gowdy with Mr. Wallace last night on Fox News,
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.240]  where he says exactly what I just said.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.080]  The media spun it, that I said I released all of it.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:35.280]  No, I said I released the redacted version of the secret memo that they're using as
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:41.440]  a roadmap for the proof of perjury and the collusion, not by the Russians, but by the
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.560]  Democratic Party and the deep state to try to stop the president.
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.560]  So let's go ahead and go to the intro of Gowdy.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:54.200]  As I discussed with Mark Short, the Washington Post reports today the president wants to
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.720]  have the memo released.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.760]  Do you agree with that?
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760]  I do.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.640]  I'm sorry that we're to this point.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:11.040]  This memo is nothing but the distilling, the reducing of thousands of pages of documents
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.960]  provided to us by the department and the bureau.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:18.560]  I said that word for word last Monday.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.920]  Have some of the crew find that, because I talked about it earlier in the show the first
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:29.200]  hour, and then they're like, hey, go ahead and cover this, and I was told, no, this is
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.200]  the memo.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.600]  It's not the redacted part, so I went with that, pointing that out, but I said word for
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.600]  word.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.880]  This is a boil down, this is a roadmap of thousands of pages of documents, but the declassified
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:45.040]  portion of the memo is the code key to prove how it all ties together and the chain of
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:50.760]  them testifying to the court under oath and then perjuring themselves to Congress.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.920]  So they lied to the FISA court or they lied to Congress.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.360]  This is what I was told by a congressman, not by Trey Gowdy, but I personally was told
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:04.240]  this two weeks ago and again a week ago from our congressional sources, and again, I'm
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.240]  told the truth.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.960]  Doesn't mean I absolutely navigated the way to describe this perfectly.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:14.360]  Gowdy, back this up again, is trying to explain this to people.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.680]  It's complex, and notice it's word for word what I said, not because I talked to Gowdy,
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.560]  not because there's talking points, but because that's what we're trying to describe is a
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.760]  big, giant, complex process and the establishment is hiding behind it.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.080]  But let's put our article up from last week so people can see it, go read the document
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.080]  for yourselves.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:39.400]  But I gotta tell you, it's a victory for mainstream media that they can just say, I put a hoax
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.680]  out last week and even have conservatives jump on board.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.800]  Exclusive Info Wars releases secret FISA memo.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.640]  Here's the reported memo leaked to Info Wars, and then we go on to explain the facts there
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.640]  and all the rest of it.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:57.240]  There are excise parts, but it says top secret, it was the secret memo, and we were the first
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.440]  to give it big attention.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.720]  Weeks before, some of the guys, what Michael Zimmerman had covered it on the show when
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.960]  he hosted a war room, but that's an example of, I didn't, why wasn't watching then?
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.640]  Just like the former head of the NSA technical says, no, this has gotten no attention.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.640]  People want this to have attention.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.080]  Remember, he's advising the president now.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.000]  So that's what's going on here, at the highest levels, so you just heard word for word what
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.240]  I said out of Trigatti's mouth, because that's what this is, and they're voting today to
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.240]  release it.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.240]  I believe they'll vote to release it.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.760]  It's gotta go before the president and the executive branch, and then, because they're
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.320]  gonna give deference to them on national security issues, Congress should just release
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.320]  this if they wanted to.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:39.080]  But they're gonna send it to the president, and the word is he's gonna release it.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.000]  Let's go ahead and go to the rest of it.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.640]  As I discussed with Mark Short, the Washington Post reports today the president wants to
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.240]  have the memo released.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.200]  Do you agree with that?
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.200]  I do.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.080]  I'm sorry that we're to this point.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:04.480]  This memo is nothing but the distilling, the reducing of thousands of pages of documents
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.840]  provided to us by the department and the bureau.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:12.080]  So there's nothing in this memo that the department is not already aware of.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.360]  If you think your viewers want to know whether or not the dossier was used in court proceedings,
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.200]  whether or not it was vetted before it was used, whether or not it's ever been vetted,
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.040]  if you are interested in who paid for the dossier, if you're interested in Christopher
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:29.280]  Steele's relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee, then
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.440]  yes, you'll want the memo to come out.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:38.640]  If you're Adam Schiff, who is consistently wrong when it comes to issues of disclosure,
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.840]  he didn't want us to find out any of this information, Chris.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.840]  He fought.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:43.840]  That's good.
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:49.680]  Full clips on him, FullWars.com, NewsWars.com, and then he just goes through it.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:54.520]  It's Obama, it's Loretta Lynch, it's McCabe, it's Comey.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.520]  They're all busted.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.280]  And you know, the left runs around every day going, busted, busted.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.560]  Well, they admit they're Russians, they're all going to prison, they're all going to
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.560]  go to jail.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:06.800]  That's hype and BS.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:12.320]  When when I get up here and I say they're busted, I've never seen something this crazy.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:15.640]  This naked, this caught red handed, and I'll explain again.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.480]  I know you know this, we got to get the word out on this.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.160]  They thought Hillary was getting in.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.760]  They thought they were invincible.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.760]  They thought they couldn't be stopped.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.800]  They thought the sky was the limit.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.280]  So they committed all these crazy crimes.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:35.480]  Then once they lose, they get even wilder, not out of hubris anymore, not out of Hutzpah,
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.400]  not out of megalomania, but out of desperation.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.520]  And that's why they're so dangerous.
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:45.840]  Then they send out black ops, spokespersons, like Michael Hastings wife, to say, if you
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.000]  release this, there's going to be a giant massacre.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  That's all code communication.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.680]  And it gets pretty naked, you know, when Phil Mudd says, we're going to kill the president.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:59.360]  I mean, Fully Cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.120]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.800]  I buy some, I use some, I store some, awesome.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:13.840]  No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life, NASA pack technology, bacon, fully cooked,
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:19.520]  fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon, or warm and served, life saving,

[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:01.800]  Hawaii was a wake up call, don't be caught without a disaster shelter.
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:06.720]  Atlas makes an all disaster shelter that will protect your family from fallout, tornadoes

[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800]  Hear that?
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.320]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.240]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.760]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:45.960]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.720]  TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:52.920]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.480]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.480]  FakeTV.com.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:04.160]  Introducing FloraLife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:09.280]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.480]  FloraLife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.600]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:22.080]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.320]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.080]  FloraLife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.600]  immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:37.680]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:38.680]  That's why.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.160]  Increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.960]  FloraLife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.360]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.

[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.520]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.520]  Go ahead.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.240]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:07.200]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.200]  It just gets old, man.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.120]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.360]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:17.520]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.240]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.800]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.800]  You know what, Alex?
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.800]  Hey, I put him on pause again.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:34.360]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.240]  under attack, we need your help.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.600]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.600]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.600]  You understand?
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.840]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.120]  I need your help, Frank.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:53.120]  Go to infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.120]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:01.760]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:22.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:27.720]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:43.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.440]  Coming up today, four o'clock central at five o'clock eastern, the house is set to vote
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:21:00.400]  to declassify the memorandum, the boil down, the documentation, the roadmap that Nunez
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:06.400]  is calling the secret FISA memo because it's based on secret sections of that memo and
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:10.880]  thousands of pages of other documents, according to the words of Trey Gowdy.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:16.880]  And then the president, I would guess by Wednesday or Thursday, will release that information
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.880]  on going to the executive branch.
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.960]  I want to get your take on what you think they're going to try to do to stop that.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:26.000]  We're going to open the phones up before the congressman joins us in the next hour to get
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.240]  into this.
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:38.600]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:44.000]  We are taking your phone calls on the memo and all that it represents, Congress standing
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.280]  up against the deep state, against rogue groups in the bureaucracy challenging the executive,
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.920]  the legislative, the judicial.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.200]  It's a big deal.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:58.160]  And then we can also get into the leftist groups, we're calling for Taylor Swift to be
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160]  boycotted.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.640]  They say she's aggressively white because she is white.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.600]  The media is saying she's bad.
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.600]  That's out of the Herald Sun.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.240]  Taylor Swift has no fear of bullies of the left.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.240]  We can get into all of that.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.480]  She's been labeled aggressively white, linked to neo-Nazis and accused of being a messenger
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.560]  of the disturbing new era.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.400]  Last week she was criticized by Buzzfeed, run by George Soros, funded by Soros for not
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.440]  taking part in the second annual Women's March to be led by Muslims, aka the world's
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.200]  largest post-election tantrum.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.960]  So we'll talk about that as well.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.840]  Meanwhile, unhinged, Michael Moore, a sales trump, unfit, narcissist, sociopath threat
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:36.840]  to humanity.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:40.400]  Yeah, people like you are the threat to humanity, buddy.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:43.080]  And meanwhile, though, people are really getting sick of Hillary Clinton.
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:49.560]  And I want to play this next clip, the full clip, just to give you the cringe worthiness
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:56.520]  of the Grammys last night that had the lowest amount of viewers ever recorded.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.720]  Grammy ratings fall.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.480]  And then it goes on to break down that it's basically a crash and burn, just like the
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.440]  NFL, just like Hollywood movie sales.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:07.840]  People are sick of being beaten over the head.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:11.520]  I personally want to go see a movie that's not political.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:18.000]  I personally want to watch a ball game sometimes, but I can't do it because it's so political.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.200]  Liberal or conservative, beating you over the head, beating you over the head, beating
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:28.320]  you over the head, the ads are propaganda, the statements are propaganda.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:37.840]  And then you've got Hillary with this fiction book, it's kind of like a historical novel.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.720]  It's posing as nonfiction, but it is fiction, but it mixes some truth and it's been totally
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.720]  discredited.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:50.120]  I don't have to go back over that can of worms, that kettle of fish, that mess, that is Mr.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:59.280]  Hare Wolf's book, but then they have these bumbling, babbling people at the Grammys
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:05.360]  who are part of this skit with Hillary, and I'm like, man, I was in middle school drama
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.360]  skits.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:11.640]  I took drama once, I think it's seventh grade then once, because one of my friends was in
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:16.480]  something like when I was a sophomore, and I remember being part of those deals.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:20.160]  I mean, we were better actors then than this is.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.560]  Of course, the left will say, oh, shut up, Jones, what do you know about acting?
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:28.080]  Well, I don't act here on this broadcast, but I have been in some big movies and major
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:33.920]  roles and done a lot of big voiceovers for cartoons and video games in a previous incarnation.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.960]  I quit doing it 10 years ago.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:40.800]  I decided that it's a distraction from battling the globalist, even though I was making more
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:43.800]  money on voiceovers than I even make here.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.960]  In fact, that's the argument is I should go do a bunch of voiceovers and stuff to find
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.960]  the info one.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:52.760]  But then once they figure out who I was politically, I'd have to have a fake name.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.560]  But you know how much they pay if you're one of these movies, and they read like two pages
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:03.280]  of lines in a movie, and I can do any voice I want, I wish my own personal voice wasn't
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:09.040]  so great and annoying, but I can do any voice I want to, basically, and that's a whole
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.040]  other area.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.040]  What is, I don't really bad, un-talented people when I see it, they may be okay lip-sinkers
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.240]  or you know, for me, I don't know who these people are, I don't pay attention.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:23.280]  I just know it's so cringe-worthy, how could anyone watch any of this?
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:28.560]  And then I watched more clips of it, and it was just people worshiping Hillary and hating
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.560]  Trump all night and trying to block the recovery of our country.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.720]  If we're going to cover this, come back, go write to your phone calls on the big issues.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:44.120]  But Hillary Clinton, Cardi B and more audition for Fire and Fury, and then Hillary reads
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:49.440]  out of this book, here it is.
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:53.680]  Fire and Fury, spoken word auditions, take one.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.560]  Trump won't read anything, it gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:03.560]  he is bored.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:07.800]  Teddy interviewed everybody in the administration, didn't interview one cabinet member, says
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.720]  the president won't read anything.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.380]  I had a long conversation with the president, there wasn't one subject I raised or one news
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:15.380]  item.
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:20.960]  Sir, let me tell you about this, I mean, again, they'll say he goes to sleep at 6.30 at night
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:23.520]  because he goes to bed at one in the morning now, they've got to go to bed a little bit
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.360]  earlier, and he gets up at 5 a.m.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.920]  These people, again, it's all lies, we all know, so this lazy moron has turned the economy
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.640]  around and all this other stuff.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:34.640]  What does it say about you?
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.680]  I mean, again, these people can hardly read off the book.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:39.680]  Go back.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.680]  Sorry.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:41.680]  Sorry, John.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.120]  It's wonderful, it just feels a bit too smooth, I don't think it's going to work out.
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.120]  Next!
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:49.200]  His comb over, semi-colon.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.200]  It pauses again.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:57.880]  Cher looks like a rubber sex robot, or like a rubber sex doll, what is she, like 75 years
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:02.160]  old, she's trying to look like she's 16, with some rubber face on, these narcissistic dirt
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.160]  bags.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.160]  Let's go back to this rubber head.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:10.640]  It was a product called Just For Men, the longer it was left on, the darker it got.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.120]  It pauses again.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:17.120]  You've got this lady that's wearing a rubber mask and is really the cryptkeeper underneath
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:22.880]  telling us about somebody being bad, dyeing their hair, and notice he's not doing it anymore
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.160]  and it's all grayish, looks a lot better, but the point is so what, he's on TV, so he's
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.800]  bad because he dyed his hair, when you're a rubber head, go back to her.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.560]  Resulted in Trump's orange blonde hair color.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:38.000]  Trump did not enjoy his own inauguration.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.680]  By the way, this is a convicted criminal, admitted pimp.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:48.160]  He did get angry and hurt, that stars were determined to embarrass him, I definitely
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.160]  wasn't there.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.160]  It pauses again.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:55.480]  The implication that we want scum like you at these events, the implication that we're
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.720]  not part of your cool club, you're a bunch of scum.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:27:59.720]  Go back to him.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:00.720]  Good work, Cardi B.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:06.480]  If Trump was not having his 6.30 dinner with Steve Bannon, then more to his liking, he
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.640]  wasn't bad by that time with a cheeseburger.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.400]  Why am I even reading this shit?
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.280]  I can't believe this.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.280]  I can't believe that he leaves.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.280]  I can't believe it.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.280]  It's just fake.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.280]  That's how he lives his life.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.280]  That's how he lives his life?
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:27.120]  If my shirt is on the floor, it's because I want it on the floor.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120]  Another one.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.120]  It's sweet or best.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120]  It's DJ Kavan.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.960]  Matter of fact, this is the best spoken word album in the game.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.960]  I'm finally going to win my Grammy.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.960]  So this isn't going to work.
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:38.960]  Next.
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:39.960]  It's not going to work.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:40.960]  Everything I do works.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:41.960]  Stand by.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:42.960]  Take one.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960]  He had a long time fear of being caught.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.960]  And now the snapping turtle.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:49.760]  One reason why he liked to eat at McDonald's, nobody knew he was coming and the food was
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:50.760]  safely pre-made.
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:51.760]  That's it.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:52.760]  We've got it.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.760]  That's the one.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.760]  You think so?
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.760]  Oh yeah.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.760]  The Grammy's in the bag?
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.760]  In the bag.
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.760]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.920]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:05.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.040]  endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.120]  Hear that?
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:34.000]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.560]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.080]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:13.120]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.680]  at infowarsore.com.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:18.520]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:22.600]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.840]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:32.040]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the

[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.120]  this is a sure win.

[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:58.400]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.760]  InfoWarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:06.360]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:11.280]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.320]  health and normal breathing.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.320]  This is pollen block.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:19.680]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:25.840]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose, itchy watery eyes,
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.440]  and excessive mucus production.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:32.520]  And against studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials, now we
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:38.320]  are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:43.120]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:46.640]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:53.200]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block, available now at infowarslife.com
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:33:21.200]  or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:24.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to your phone calls.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:29.680]  We're going to John in Wyoming, Amy in New Jersey, Forest in House.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:31.120]  We're going to go to Tom in London.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.320]  We're going to go to Mark in Oregon, George in Connecticut, Chris, and many, many others.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:37.560]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:43.240]  The websites are infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:46.080]  Hillary Clinton does not know when to go away.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.280]  She is back there at the Grammys, tanking their ratings.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:53.120]  Hollywood doesn't understand that people are sick of this or they just don't care because
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.160]  their job is controlling and dominating people.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.360]  When they politically control us, they get trillions and trillions of dollars.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.920]  Even though there's hundreds of billions of dollars a year in entertainment, that is
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:10.360]  still secondary to its overall mission of suppressing and controlling the people.
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:14.520]  The White House is set to have a press briefing on why McCabe's stepped down.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.200]  We're going to carry some of that.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:22.520]  I want to carry the opening statement, not so much even the questions, but we know why.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:27.240]  It's now come out, reported at last hour, that he was the main leaker in meetings with
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:31.800]  the president that were on leaks.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:35.360]  And again, they were using the fact that it was secret to act like bad things were happening
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.200]  and putting out fake leaks.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:42.920]  And all of this is coming home to roost.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:46.280]  Before we go to your calls, we have a new special.
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.680]  We're running an infowarstore.com, and it is your purchase of the products that makes
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:50.680]  everything possible.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.200]  Plus, these are great products.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.840]  Rainforest, we went out and researched the top-neutropic brain pills that are healthy
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840]  and natural.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:01.360]  There's a lot about there that are powerful, but they're not known as being healthier and
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.360]  natural.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:05.520]  Rainforest is, and that's why it's become incredibly popular.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:15.240]  It has close to 6,000 reviews, 5,828, an average of 92% or a 4.8 star.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:20.720]  Unprecedented, it's brain force plus, there's now 20% more in each bottle.
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:24.040]  Leading competitors cost two to three times more and aren't even as good.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.720]  We have it for 40% off.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:29.120]  And we have vitamin mineral fusion with it.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:33.200]  When you get the two together, vitamin mineral fusion, advanced multi-vitamin formulation
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:38.160]  with all the vitamins, all the minerals, the trace elements, and then it's got the amino
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:43.720]  acids for better upload, great for adults, great for children, all natural, infowarstore.com
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:46.920]  or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:49.520]  And no reviews yet on that because it's the new special.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:53.520]  As you can see right there, your purchase makes the broadcast possible.
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:36:00.280]  Separately, I am very excited that we did this as an introductory offer because we're
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:02.720]  about to sell out of it the next week.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:07.240]  It deals with seasonal distress disorder, the pollen, the issues, the sneezing, the
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:11.480]  headaches that hit so many people around the country at different times of the year.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:16.640]  Japanese quail, it's secret, no one knows why, fed a special diet in France before they
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:25.120]  discovered it, has a major, major, major, major effect that in studies you name it has
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.960]  been even more successful than a lot of the toxic garbage that gets sold out there.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:30.160]  All I know is it works.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:36.320]  People discovered support and it's 51% off, 1776, but folks are really into this.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.080]  They're ordering a lot of it, which helps from the operation, but not much at this price
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:45.600]  because we have discounted it 51% at 1776, infowarstore.com.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:50.560]  That is selling out, hopefully we'll get more in a few months, but it is just blasting
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:55.760]  off the shelves, so that is definitely a hit product, infowarstore.com, and something else
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:58.200]  is going to blast off the shelves.
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:04.280]  It's body ease, whole body support, ultimate turmeric formula, it's got over 400 milligrams
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:10.920]  of pure turmeric, that's 95% curcuminin, when the leading competitors are 3%.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:16.080]  They just rip you off and just give you, I guess, the outside of the root or whatever.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:20.320]  This is 95%, and we can prove all that.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:24.920]  From the top lab in the country, 60 day supplies, if you don't know what this does for you,
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:30.040]  you need to research the incredible effects that are documented with turmeric, and then
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:35.720]  it's got other compounds that are also incredibly antioxidants like organic lemon balm leaf,
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:46.120]  baswila, it's got the organic thyme leaf, and other key ingredients, infowarstore.com,
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.720]  infowarslife.com, or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:52.560]  Again, thank you all for support.
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.320]  We support our local A&F affiliates, TV stations, you name it, support those local sponsors.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:03.000]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls now, ladies and gentlemen, we're awaiting just at least
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.560]  the opening statement at the press conference about the FBI acting director, who we now
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.920]  know ran the fake Russiagate dossier, lied to the president, said he didn't, was such
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:16.360]  a good liar, the president had him in meetings about the leakers, when he was there with
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:22.760]  Garcidius, it's almost like Yoda and Mace Windu, he's a cheesy Star Wars now, and they're
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:27.080]  like, we're blinded by the powers of the Sith Lord, where is he?
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:34.320]  And the head senator, saying, I don't know, but find him immediately, they're like right
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:40.160]  there with him, so it's just insane.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.280]  Our caller in London hung up, I wanted to go to the caller in London first, caller in
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.840]  London, if you get back in, we'll go right back to you.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.840]  That's a bummer.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:51.800]  John in Wyoming, you're on the air, thanks for holding, welcome.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:58.800]  Alex, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, and I was watching Fox about 45 minutes ago,
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:03.280]  and I saw them announce that Andrew McCabe is going to be stepping down.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.640]  I think what we're going to see here is like a snowball rolling downhill, we're going
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:13.880]  to see more and more of these Obama holdovers being exposed to the American public so they
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:21.080]  can see just how sleazy that Hillary and Obama really are, that they will stop at nothing
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:24.680]  to try to destroy President Trump.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:30.800]  And I think these recent charges that have come up against Steve Wynn, these about sexual
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:39.080]  improprieties toward his employees, I think were just a crock because it's the same prostitute
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:45.040]  news media that was attacking President Trump because he once had two scoops of ice cream
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:52.240]  on his dessert rather than one, who the hell needs the prostitute media to tell us how much
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:59.840]  ice cream we can eat, who needs them to tell us anything or whom we can vote for for President.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:05.360]  These people are so desperate they will lie about anyone and everyone who supports President
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.360]  Trump.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:11.720]  And they've been in power so long, even as their ratings go down, we're talking on average
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:15.960]  20% a year and we're like in the year three of this.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:21.080]  It's devastating everything, Hollywood is down 20% this year, NFL over 20%, Grammys
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:26.080]  over 20%, they are self-immolating themselves and they just can't stop.
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.080]  And of course, I did check, it's true about the two scoops of ice cream, but it wasn't
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.240]  like other people don't get more, he just likes a big dessert, his drug is food, Trump
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:38.080]  likes food, it's admitted, he doesn't drink, he doesn't do other stuff, but the point is
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:43.400]  is that they then, you know, fire and fury says he goes to sleep at 6.30 at night.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:45.080]  That's a complete and total lie.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:47.840]  I mean, so they've tried to say he works too much.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:52.960]  Now they're saying the other thing, here's my concern, John, I'm worried that because
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:56.800]  before they were hubris filled, as I've said, and thought Hillary went, so they committed
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.800]  these crimes.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:00.280]  Now they committed more crimes because they're desperate to cover it up.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.760]  Now, what are they going to do in the next few weeks as their whole house of cards comes
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:05.760]  down?
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.920]  Well, one of the things that I'm worried about is that since they still have so many
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:17.080]  holdovers in the Justice Department and in the FBI and that, you know, all of these corrupt
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:22.920]  agencies that they're going to maybe try to put an assassination on our president.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:26.200]  And if they do, it's going to hit the fan from coast to coast.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:30.640]  Yeah, I'm not a violent person and I'm not planning anything as I've said, but I mean,
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:37.280]  I want to warn the establishment, everybody is sick of the globalists, the local bureaucrats,
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:41.920]  the UN people, the communists, all of those people, everybody's like Santa Claus and making
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:42.920]  a list.
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:47.920]  And I'm just reporting what people are saying everywhere and they're committed if they were
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:56.800]  dumb enough to kill the president, guaranteed within six hours of it happening, the globalists
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:01.000]  better be smart enough to be in a bunker somewhere is all I'm saying.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.720]  Or that better be on that first mission to Mars.
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.720]  You're absolutely right.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.160]  But listen, here's the deal.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:11.920]  We know why Mudd four months ago was saying we're going to kill the president while they
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:14.680]  were on TV, Brennan and them saying we're going to take him out.
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:17.800]  It was to confidence game their minions, their minions.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:20.280]  We now have the text messages six months ago.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:24.240]  We're running scared saying we got to stop this in the text messages show.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:28.280]  A lot of these names we've seen have now turned over to Congress, by the way.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:30.760]  And so that's why we're winning right now.
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:35.840]  Well I'm just wondering what it's going to take before Jeff Sessions starts doing his
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.880]  job and starts prosecuting these people who are threatening the president's life.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.800]  Jeff Sessions is 100% compromised.
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:46.280]  We now know that and I think they have something on him.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:47.680]  Oh, they certainly do.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:53.520]  And I think I think I know what it is to thank you so much.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.720]  We'll be back for more calls.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:03.720]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:05.320]  probiotic.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:12.040]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:19.720]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:24.680]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:31.360]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:35.920]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:38.440]  probiotic on the market.
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:43.520]  For your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:47.120]  and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.360]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public.
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:57.120]  So please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:03.800]  Climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by info wars life for those who want
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:07.440]  to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:12.840]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:15.400]  about 1 to 2% per year.
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:22.600]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:27.120]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:28.120]  the market.
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:34.600]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:41.520]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:47.560]  from Peru, horny goatweed from China and tribulus from India.
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:51.520]  Reach your alpha male potential with alpha power.

[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.960]  Introducing cell force by info wars life.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:06.040]  This focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.800]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.440]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:16.120]  Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:18.600]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:23.080]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:25.520]  reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:30.680]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:33.560]  these reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.600]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:43.400]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:46.160]  species and other free radicals.
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:51.240]  Boost, protect and adapt with cell force from info wars life.
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:59.560]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:03.680]  Every year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:08.560]  if you want proven studies and documentation, let me speak for hours, this is on the files
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:12.880]  I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:18.040]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, anytime of the year.
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:21.240]  But immune wall is incredible at folks.
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:24.240]  Other formulas that aren't even as good are $70-80.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:25.840]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:31.960]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf and so much more, it is concentrated, you need
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.520]  to go read what is in here.
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:38.480]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.480]  accelerate.
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:42.360]  A citrus peel blend, I mean this is the next level.
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:46.680]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall, I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:49.080]  Beta-glucan, olive leaf and more.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:47:02.240]  Immune wall, infowarsstore.com, infowarslive.com, or triple-A, 2533139.
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:20.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:48.120]  This isn't meet the new boss, same as the old boss, because the globalists are having
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:50.120]  convulsions.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.800]  This is a true revolution.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:48:02.120]  And it's back to big, aggressive, Americana, wealth, freedom, wild, wild west, get out
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:05.280]  of the way.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:17.120]  Just like yesterday, I get on my knees and pray, won't get fooled again.
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:23.000]  So it comes around like every hundred years, enjoy it, folks.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.280]  It ain't perfect, but it's real.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:27.800]  That's why the parasites are going crazy.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:28.800]  Woo!
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.200]  Going back to your phone calls here, George in Connecticut, George, thanks for holding
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.200]  you're on the air.
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:35.200]  We'll go to Mark and Oregon and others.
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.600]  Yeah, I have three points.
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:41.520]  One, I think we should, you should bring on an expert on the old-fashioned grand jury
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.040]  system that you don't need a prosecutor to bring it together so we can stop prosecuting
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:51.160]  these politicians who will not go after these criminals who are in the government misusing
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.800]  the intelligence and investigating people like that.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:49:04.600]  And sort of on the back of that, I was up in Kingston with Joe Solente, Gary Knoll,
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:09.080]  and Ralph Nader about a year ago, and we were discussing a lot of issues.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:13.840]  And Ralph Nader came out with a book, I don't remember exact titles for a while, that basically
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:17.360]  said that the left and the right should be coming together at some point, because we
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:23.000]  have common interest in keeping this democracy alive, and they're using this division to
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.080]  basically take us apart.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:28.120]  Maybe you should have him on the show and maybe discuss that book and some of those
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:29.120]  issues.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:30.120]  That'd be a good issue.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:33.720]  Well, I've had Ralph Nader on before, and I've invited him back on, he hasn't come
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:34.720]  on.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:35.720]  But I totally agree.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:38.520]  We've got population, we've got wars, we've got issues.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:41.720]  I want everybody to come together, but not under some authoritarian world government.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:45.000]  Look at this article by Kit Daniels that's got to go viral.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:51.160]  The Chinese Death Star laser under development in Shanghai lab, the laser is so powerful,
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:56.280]  they believe it punches a hole in the space time continuum and actually creates black
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.280]  holes.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.280]  Now this is mainstream news.
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:00.440]  Now, obviously the US is way ahead of this.
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:04.640]  We've made any matter weapons and stuff, but everybody's going to start getting this.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:07.280]  And this just shows how dangerous the planet is.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:09.920]  And then what we're going to do with Kim Jong-un tries to get something like this.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.440]  So that story is on infowars.com.
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:16.080]  Overall though, listen, do you disagree or agree?
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:21.360]  I mean, Trump has got a lot of the globalist mad because they want wealth without the people
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.360]  having it.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.360]  The establishment itself is really pissed off at Trump.
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:25.360]  What do you think?
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.800]  I think absolutely, but I have an idea on that issue too.
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:35.200]  Why not have a two year tax rebate for all those states that basically are the blue
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:40.360]  states, if they get rid of all the illegals in the poor communities that basically burdening
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:45.360]  those taxpayers should basically losing their homes or, or can even a feed themselves because
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:46.360]  they're loading up.
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:47.360]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:49.560]  And again, I'm not against all these economic refugees.
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.800]  I realize the globalist exploited them.
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:55.080]  They're being collapsed into us, but it's not fair.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:59.640]  And Trump goes, okay, I'll do a thousand, I'll do 1.8 million and they go, no, total
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:00.640]  open borders.
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:01.640]  We want everything.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.040]  It shows where it's going.
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:07.720]  It's just trying to be reasonable, stabilize the economy and they won't even let him do
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:08.720]  that.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:09.720]  Showing it's a fraud.
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:10.720]  Yeah.
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:15.720]  I mean, Bernie Sanders went on TV this weekend and said, we did shut down the government.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:21.560]  We can't, we have to have totally open borders, but, but, you know, nobody else has open borders
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:22.560]  like that.
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:23.560]  Thank you so much, George.
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:24.560]  Okay.
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:25.560]  Who's up next here?
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:29.920]  Amy wants to put the memo out now and we'll go to her in just a minute as well.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:33.640]  We got forest, uh, got so many calls to get here.
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:36.960]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:38.920]  Let's go ahead and talk to Amy in New Jersey.
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:39.920]  You're on the air.
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:40.920]  Welcome.
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:46.880]  Hi, Alex, you know, um, Trump really needs to spill it out tomorrow night at a state
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:47.880]  of union.
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:48.880]  Wait a minute.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:49.880]  Wait a minute.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:50.880]  Wait a minute.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:53.960]  We had a caller last week that said he ought to release the memo at the state of the union.
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:56.120]  They're going to pass it tonight to let him get it.
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:57.840]  He's got to declassify it then.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.120]  I was thinking to take a few days.
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:02.240]  I bet he releases it tomorrow at the state of the union.
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:04.760]  You know why he's going to miss an opportunity.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:11.080]  You got my, my socialist father and my socialist sister who continue to watch and get brainwashed
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:17.080]  by MSNBC and CNN, they, they're going to miss an opportunity to, to do program people.
[01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:18.320]  Well, Amy, you're such a genius.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.320]  Let me just shut up.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:22.920]  Let me just shut up and have you restart because I want people to hear this in your own words,
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:26.720]  not me guessing what you were going to say, repeat what you were about to say when I obnoxiously
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:28.440]  interrupted you.
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:33.840]  We have to brain deep, deep program the people like I was at my father's house, my parents'
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:38.520]  house yesterday and like he's watching this MSNBC and I'm like, you have no idea what's
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:39.720]  going to drop that.
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:45.880]  I'm like, and if you tell him anything, he'll blow up like, oh, you're, you are such a right
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:46.880]  wink of spurious.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:48.880]  You know, you cannot argue with these people.
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:53.080]  You need to get on there tomorrow night and totally lay it out.
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:54.600]  He needs a whiteboard.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:58.280]  He needs to do diagrams and tell people what's going on.
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:00.360]  That's a missed opportunity.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:03.800]  Strike when the iron's hot, not when it dies down.
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.280]  And I want you to be on the military tribunal.
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:11.320]  I want you, I would love to see you roast these people at a military tribunal.
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:13.440]  You would be the best one to do it, Alex.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:17.760]  Well, you're a sweetheart, Amy, but that could turn into what we're trying to fight here.
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:22.520]  I think grand juries, the citizens, you name it, but you're absolutely right that they
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:24.160]  work for foreign powers.
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:25.720]  The globalists are trying to overturn the country.
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:29.080]  They're trying to overturn our revolution against them.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:33.000]  And so there could be military tribunals under international law under this, but I just want
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.080]  to fix this now, but not to steal your thunder.
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:41.160]  What you're saying is, I think you're absolutely right, Trump should release the memo tomorrow
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:47.320]  right before a state of the union so that he can get into the collusion and the conspiracy
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:52.800]  against the voters of America and tell people that we're conned by the media lies.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:53.800]  I care about you.
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:55.600]  I want you to be prosperous.
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:58.000]  This has been screwing this country over for a long time.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.120]  Please, they're brainwashing you.
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:04.320]  I'm asking you to really research what's happened and to understand this is not business as
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:05.320]  usual.
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:07.680]  Look at what's happening with the economy, you name it.
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:09.280]  I'm not that good.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:11.840]  There were artificial controls to make you poor.
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:14.440]  We're just removing them because we believe in you.
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:17.080]  I think if he said that, it would devastate him once and for all.
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:20.280]  I'm worried he'll set a nuke off tomorrow or something and kill the president.
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:22.280]  I mean, there's no telling what they'll do.
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:26.800]  Well, you know, I have a nine-year-old daughter, you have kids, this is about the kids.
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:32.120]  This is about giving them hope for their future so that they want to have their own children.
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:33.840]  And that's key again.
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:36.560]  Get this lady's name because just like the caller earlier, I want to have a show with
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:39.920]  the callers where it's our best callers, everything she's saying is true.
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:44.400]  It's not we want to be like Oprah Winfrey, everything's wonderful, la, la, la.
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:48.200]  What you're saying is they've been demoralizing us in the media, telling us we're bad, making
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:52.200]  us fight with each other, and then here comes Trump with all this positivity and it's working
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:54.320]  because we've got some good things to celebrate here.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.320]  You're absolutely right.
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:58.880]  So you're saying you're refreshed by the fact that Trump's not trying to demoralize
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:54:59.880]  us.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:00.880]  Absolutely.
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.480]  And I'm Jewish and I'm sick of the liberal Jews that are being the capos again to set
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:10.580]  us up to get scapegoated for a new world order that, you know, we just had Holocaust
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:12.080]  remember and stay.
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:15.680]  Well, you know, I don't think people have learned.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:17.000]  The liberal Jews have not learned.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.160]  All they want to do is the same thing as the black people of this country to play the victim.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:27.840]  We have to stop playing the victim, open your eyes, see what's going on and see repeated
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:29.680]  patterns and stop the patterns.
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:30.880]  What you just said is key.
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:31.880]  What you just said is key.
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:33.320]  It's the equation you never hear from Hollywood.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:35.120]  Yeah, Jews do get persecuted.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:36.120]  It's wrong.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:42.480]  Hitler horrible, but absolutely leftist Jews and others historically have sat there, helped
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.760]  build this up, done these things with the corrupt regime like Hitler and others.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:51.360]  And then they leave the country and scapegoat the Jewish population and they make the Jewish
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:54.200]  population pay them money to get out.
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:56.320]  It's absolutely horrible.
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.320]  And that's part of the equation.
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:55:59.560]  The meal is saying, Joe just said the Jews right at all.
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:01.360]  No, it's the opposite.
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:07.400]  You can see the UN and Soros who set up the Jews in his earlier life doing it again in
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:11.400]  his own WikiLeaks saying he wants to overthrow Israel and all this stuff.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:16.520]  You can see them under the UN world government setting Israel and Jews up to be scapegoated
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:17.520]  again.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:18.520]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:24.240]  That's what this is, I see it, my family was in the Holocaust, I've seen this before.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:31.440]  And my great-grandparents, my mother's great-grandmother or grandmother, they rounded them up in Romania
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:34.280]  and shot them in the ditch by us at Scroopin.
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:36.600]  Don't give up your guns, Jews, come on.
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:40.880]  You got to fight and not let them disarm anybody because it will happen again if you let that
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:41.880]  happen.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:42.880]  Thank you, Alan.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:43.880]  God bless you.
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:44.880]  Absolutely.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:48.000]  Some of the greatest folks fighting tyranny or Jewish and some of the worst people like
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.200]  George Soros is Jewish, but George Soros isn't Jewish, he's a demon.
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.440]  He helped round up thousands of Jews, bragged about it, and was so arrogant, he bragged
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:00.480]  about it on 60 Minutes and wrote a book about it, and then he wants to shut me down because
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.480]  I talk about it.
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:05.760]  As that Hollywood Jews go, Alex, we like your show and you're a good guy, but George Soros
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:07.520]  had to do it to survive.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:13.400]  If I was 15 years old, people said, help us round up a couple thousand Jews or anybody
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:15.800]  else or we're going to shoot you in the head.
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:22.320]  I play along with it only long enough to get their rifle and shoot them.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:26.680]  I just don't get that whole thing, and it's the same deal.
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:30.040]  George Soros is an evil, opportunist piece of crap.
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:33.120]  All right, we're going to come right back with more calls and we've got a congressman
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:37.920]  joining us dealing with the whole release of the memo and so much more in the third
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:38.920]  hour.
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:47.320]  If you're listening to local affiliates, please tell people about the show, it's key.
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:53.080]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:59.040]  encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:07.320]  or books or videos or other material from infostore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:12.240]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:13.240]  at infowarstore.com.
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:16.880]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:20.760]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:23.160]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:27.280]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, the colloidal silver
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:35.120]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139 and your purchase of the products stands
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.640]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:42.880]  satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:49.280]  they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:53.800]  Introducing fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by infowarslife
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:56.680]  after years of research on the human microbiome.
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:59.160]  Not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:03.480]  Fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:07.440]  releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:11.920]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:16.520]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:20.960]  Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:23.480]  immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:27.520]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:28.520]  That's why.
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:32.400]  Increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:36.800]  If it's sold as a 15-billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50-billion
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.760]  probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program, head to infowarslife.com to pick
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:51.720]  up your bottle of fluorolife probiotics today, that's infowarslife.com.
[01:59:51.720 --> 02:00:07.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:14.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies, born and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:19.440]  Well, he's a freshman congressman, but he's on fire.
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:24.520]  And really at the center, along with Trey Galli and others, exposing the Clinton crime network,
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:28.880]  Matt Gates joins us from Florida, he's in Congress right now, coming up in the next
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:29.880]  segment.
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.040]  But I wanted to play these two clips right now, and after Gates leaves, I'll go back
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:35.000]  to all the phone calls.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:41.760]  I wanted to play campaigners chant Churchill was a racist as they storm a cafe that is
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:43.800]  themed after Churchill.
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:47.640]  The leftists have all these things from Mao and Lenin and Stalin that killed together
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:49.880]  about 120 million people.
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:55.720]  But Mao's 80-plus million of that, the grand champion of mass murder.
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:57.440]  But it's all about them bullying everybody.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:01.760]  When Churchill stood against Hitler, you name it, it's just crazy.
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:05.360]  But again, they hate anything British, anything sovereign.
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:09.080]  And then after that, college students hate Trump's State of the Union before they've
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:12.040]  done it from the great folks at college reform.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:16.080]  So here is first Churchill, then the college reform piece, then we'll come back with Congressman
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:20.320]  Gates with the latest on the memo, the FBI director stepping down and more stay with
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.320]  us.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:25.320]  We cannot accept the unashamed colonial and gentrifying presence of this cafe.
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:28.560]  You're element of the colonial and the political.
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:29.560]  We demand that.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:33.680]  To the owner of the cafe, apologize to the local community for their poorly thought and
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:37.520]  insensitive branding and probably change it from the menu to the aesthetics and decor
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:38.520]  of the cafe.
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:42.720]  To the customer, we ask you that you boycott this cafe until they take the concerns of
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:43.720]  the community seriously.
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:46.720]  It's a do meet a fight for our freedom.
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:50.720]  We are doing the fight for our freedom.
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:52.720]  It is our duty to win.
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:56.160]  We must live and support each other.
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:01.160]  We have nothing to lose, but our change.
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:05.680]  We are doing the fight for our freedom.
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:08.760]  We must live and support each other.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:10.520]  We must live and support each other.
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:12.520]  We have nothing to lose by a change.
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:14.520]  We have nothing to lose by a change.
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:16.520]  We have nothing to lose by a change.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.520]  We have nothing to lose by a change.
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:20.520]  We have nothing to lose by a change.
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:22.520]  We have nothing to lose by a change.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.520]  We have nothing to lose by a change.
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:26.520]  Church were fought for our freedoms.
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:28.520]  I'm Kevin Thulles of Campus Reform.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:30.520]  Today we're at NYU getting students' opinions on President
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:32.520]  Trump's data-the-union address.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:34.520]  Except that speech won't happen for another seven days.
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:36.520]  But what will they say when we ask them
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:38.520]  what they thought of it? Let's find out.
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:40.520]  Well, we've been getting people's reactions today
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:42.520]  to the State of the Union last night.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:44.520]  Some people were saying that it was the most racist
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:46.520]  State of the Union that's ever happened.
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:48.520]  What was your reaction to everything that was said?
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:50.520]  I didn't watch it because I couldn't bring myself to watch it.
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:52.520]  It's quite racist at the very least.
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:54.520]  It's not up there with most racist.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:56.520]  Wow.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:58.520]  It's already quickly climbing the scale.
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.520]  Some of the people said today that
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:02.520]  they thought his immigration stance
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:04.520]  that he outlined last night was
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:06.520]  especially hateful.
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:08.520]  What did you think of it?
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.520]  It's something that I wouldn't have expected to happen
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:14.520]  in our lifetime.
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:16.520]  It's offensive. It is crazy.
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:18.520]  But I'm not shocked by what he's done
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:20.520]  in the past.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:22.520]  I believe what I'm hearing
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:24.520]  about
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:26.520]  his rough nature
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:28.520]  and the hate that he probably said.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:30.520]  He told the Democrats
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:32.520]  the wall got 10 feet higher because
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:34.520]  they didn't stand up and give him applause
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:36.520]  at one point.
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:38.520]  What do you think of all that?
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:40.520]  It's the behavior of someone who refuses
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:42.520]  to accept accountability for their failures.
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:44.520]  The way he acts, you shouldn't be acting
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:46.520]  like that if you're the leader of the country
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:48.520]  regardless of what party you're in.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:50.520]  That frustrates me a lot.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:52.520]  It doesn't surprise me that
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:54.520]  that was the State of the Union address.
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.520]  Hopefully everything that he's outlined
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:58.520]  can
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:00.520]  be overturned by the public opinion.
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:02.520]  Was there anything in particular that you saw
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:04.520]  about?
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:06.520]  Probably an immigration going on with the whole
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:08.520]  deck.
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:10.520]  One of the craziest moments when he started
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:12.520]  a build the wall chant with all the Republicans
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:14.520]  that were there.
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:16.520]  People on social media were accusing him of
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:18.520]  basically using the State of the Union as a
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:20.520]  campaign event.
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:22.520]  That's kind of ridiculous.
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:24.520]  I think it's absolutely crazy.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:26.520]  The fact that he started a chant,
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:28.520]  he's big on those.
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:30.520]  What's your reaction?
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:32.520]  Well, a lot of times
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:34.520]  they're trying to say don't listen to what he's saying
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:36.520]  and they just want to shut it down
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:38.520]  just because of Trump saying it.
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:40.520]  Do you think they have any ground there?
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:42.520]  I don't think so. I think there are enough
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:44.520]  progressive and intellectual people
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:46.520]  that really analyze what he's saying.
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:48.520]  Do you think he's going to fall through with the things
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:50.520]  that he promised last night?
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:52.520]  I don't know. We'll see.
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:54.520]  He said he's going to become president. He became president.
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:58.520]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:00.520]  Go ahead.
[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:02.520]  I just have to say something, man.
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:04.520]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.520]  you're bragging.
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:08.520]  It just gets old, man.
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:10.520]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:12.520]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:14.520]  Do you understand they're having congressional
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:16.520]  hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:18.520]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:20.520]  If that was happening to anybody else,
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:22.520]  I'd be freaked out.
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.520]  What's it going to take us being shut down?
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:26.520]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:28.520]  I put him on pause again.
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:30.520]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:32.520]  to say we are the tip of the spear.
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:34.520]  We're under attack. We need your help.
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:36.520]  As much begging as I do,
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:38.520]  we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:40.520]  I'm not going to just stop growth
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:42.520]  and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:44.520]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:46.520]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:48.520]  Go to infowarstore.com
[02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:50.520]  right now and help fund
[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:52.520]  the Info War.
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:54.520]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.520]  I need your help, Frank.
[02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:58.520]  From the front lines
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:00.520]  of the information war,
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:02.520]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:10.520]  All right, my friends.
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:12.520]  We are now into
[02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:14.520]  our number three.
[02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:18.520]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:20.520]  for joining us.
[02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:22.520]  There's an ongoing press conference
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:24.520]  about dealing with the stepping down
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:26.520]  five months earlier than he said he would
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:28.520]  of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe,
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:30.520]  who we know now was
[02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:32.520]  the leaker, according to Ritz Priebus,
[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:34.520]  of secret information
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:36.520]  to the press while he was meeting with the president
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:38.520]  to deal with leaks that were violating
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:40.520]  national security. That is just
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:42.520]  huge.
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:44.520]  As this whole house of cards comes down
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.520]  and I got to tell you, it has been
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:48.520]  folks in Congress
[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:50.520]  like the Chairman
[02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.520]  Nunez and people like Trey Gowdy
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:54.520]  and people like Jim Jordan
[02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:56.520]  who have been leading the charge
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:58.520]  against this incredible bullying.
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:00.520]  And we're very thankful for President Trump
[02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:02.520]  and the American people being awake and seeing through
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:04.520]  the Russia collusion canard that tries to
[02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:06.520]  violate our election
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:08.520]  and what the people have done,
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:10.520]  the will of the people.
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:12.520]  But without these congressmen
[02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:14.520]  up there telling the truth,
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:16.520]  there would be nobody out there.
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:18.520]  And the leftist media has pointed this out.
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:20.520]  Out of the gates,
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:22.520]  pun intended, Matt Gates
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.520]  from Florida has been one of the strongest,
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:26.520]  most focused,
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:28.520]  eloquent on target voices
[02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:30.520]  who we've all watched on Fox News, CNN,
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:32.520]  MSNBC doing
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:34.520]  battle. And he's got a statement out on
[02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:36.520]  the deputy director, acting director
[02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:38.520]  stepping down and so much more on the eve
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:40.520]  of the
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:42.520]  vote here on the memo
[02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:44.520]  and so much more. So Congressman Matt Gates,
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:46.520]  thank you for joining us.
[02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:48.520]  We're with you, Alex.
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.520]  Well, wow, what a time to be alive seeing all this.
[02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:52.520]  Where should we start with
[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:54.520]  a McCabe or with
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:56.520]  the vote tonight on the memo? I mean, so much is happening.
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:58.520]  Well, I think we've got a lot
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:00.520]  of momentum in the Congress to get this memo
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:02.520]  released before the American people
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:04.520]  and that's absolutely essential.
[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:06.520]  We've got to decide as a country what kind
[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:08.520]  of government we want to have,
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:10.520]  what individual liberties protected by our
[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:12.520]  Constitution are worthy of fighting
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:14.520]  for. I think it's also important for the FBI
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.520]  to move on past the era
[02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:18.520]  of Andrew McCabe. I wish him the best.
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:20.520]  I certainly don't hope
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:22.520]  anything bad happens to him going forward.
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:24.520]  But I absolutely think
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.520]  that the FBI and the Department
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:28.520]  of Justice have become so politicized
[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:30.520]  that they had lost
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:32.520]  their way and they lost the confidence of the American
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:34.520]  people. And now we've got to rebuild that
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:36.520]  through reforms and transparency.
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.520]  And I think the first thing we can do in the
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:40.520]  Congress is vote to release this memo.
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:42.520]  I mean, obviously
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:44.520]  you and others have seen parts of the memo.
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:46.520]  You've talked to people that have seen the memo.
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:48.520]  I saw Trey Gowdy on Fox News last
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.520]  night getting that it's more
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:52.520]  than a memo. It's a compendium
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:54.520]  of the research of the chain of events.
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.520]  Can you speak to that and what those chain of events
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:58.520]  basically are? I mean, it's pretty clear
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:00.520]  you've got a cabal of Clintonites
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:02.520]  inside of the
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:04.520]  Justice Department and the FBI who wanted to
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:06.520]  stop him becoming president, stop him
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:08.520]  being even elected. And it looks like
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:10.520]  they even went more crazy once he was
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:12.520]  elected to try to basically stop
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:14.520]  him and have him removed.
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:16.520]  Yeah, I can say that the period
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:18.520]  of time covered in the memo deals with time
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:20.520]  both before and after
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:22.520]  the 2016 presidential election.
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:24.520]  And one would not have to read the memo
[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:26.520]  to even hold the views you hold
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:28.520]  because there's so much information that's
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:30.520]  in the public square about the text
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:32.520]  messages between Peter Struck
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:34.520]  and Lisa Page about, you know,
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:36.520]  the special status
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:38.520]  that Hillary Clinton received
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:40.520]  when she was being investigated.
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:42.520]  But really, the way
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:44.520]  in which intelligence has been collected
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.520]  and the manner in which that intelligence
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:48.520]  was authenticated, I think
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:50.520]  is worthy of a debate in the Congress
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:52.520]  because we need to ensure
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:54.520]  that we don't have an empowerment
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:56.520]  of these institutions linked
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:09:58.520]  to political organizations
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:00.520]  in a way that allows something
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:02.520]  so important, like the FBI
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:04.520]  or the Department of Justice to be converted
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:06.520]  into a political
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:08.520]  just a political
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:10.520]  hatch a job where they go after
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:12.520]  one party in favor of another
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:14.520]  and that's what we don't want to see happen
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:15.520]  in this country.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:17.520]  Congressman Gates looking at this,
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:19.520]  how did they think they get away with it?
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:21.520]  Because they try to say, oh did Nunes invent
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:23.520]  his smoking gun. Invent it, the text
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:25.520]  messages of insurance policies
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:27.520]  and stroke saying, I don't buy it,
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:29.520]  there's no evidence, and
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:31.520]  meeting with McCabe, while McCabe
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:33.520]  is being advertised as the president
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:35.520]  as the new director and a great guy
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:37.520]  when he's the guy that looks like running the cabal.
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:39.520]  I understand you're not out in some vendetta
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:41.520]  after McCabe, but doesn't
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:43.520]  this all have to come out? I mean we're hearing
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:45.520]  there's a lot of even bigger smoking guns
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:47.520]  that are about to come out.
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:49.520]  There's no doubt about that. This memo
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:51.520]  is not the last piece of evidence
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:53.520]  in this story. It's an important
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:55.520]  gathering of the evidence and it's a laying
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:57.520]  out of the evidence, but it certainly
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:10:59.520]  doesn't cover all periods of time
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:01.520]  and I can say generally
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:03.520]  as it relates to the FISA laws
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:05.520]  there are original
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:07.520]  applications for FISA warrants
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:09.520]  and then the law requires those
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:11.520]  FISA warrants to be renewed every 90 days
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:13.520]  based on the information collected
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:15.520]  and so I think that we've got to
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:17.520]  have a very broad view of
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:19.520]  the evidence and the full time period
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:21.520]  before evaluating what reforms
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:23.520]  we would make in the Congress to this process
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:25.520]  to ensure it doesn't happen again and
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:27.520]  you mentioned Mr. McCabe as a
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:29.520]  central figure in so much of what went on
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:31.520]  that has come out
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:33.520]  by looking at the text messages of
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:35.520]  you know of Peter Strzok
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:37.520]  and Lisa Page and we're called
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:39.520]  like conspiracy theorists because
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:41.520]  we see this cabal right in
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:43.520]  front of us. We're able to aggregate these
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:45.520]  data points and show what was really going on.
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:47.520]  The reality is we're just
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.520]  looking at the very messages
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:51.520]  that the people that were at the center of the Hillary Clinton investigation
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:53.520]  and the center of
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:55.520]  Robert Mueller's investigation
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:57.520]  were saying to one another. I mean that seems to be
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:11:59.520]  an entirely reasonable review of the facts
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:01.520]  to look at the communications between
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:03.520]  people who had central roles in the investigation
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:05.520]  and I don't think there's any dispute
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:07.520]  that there was extreme bias
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:09.520]  but not only bias in their minds
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:11.520]  in their actions, in their planning
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.520]  in the things that they were doing
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:15.520]  and it's one of the reasons why
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:17.520]  I filed legislation today
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:19.520]  to get this memo released. I was joined
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:21.520]  by 35 of my Republican colleagues
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:23.520]  and also this evening I'll be
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:25.520]  taking the floor of the Congress with
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:27.520]  over a dozen members each
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:29.520]  giving their own voice to this movement
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:31.520]  to get this memo released so that we
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:33.520]  can have a debate and discussion in the public
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:35.520]  about its contents. Congressman Gates
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:37.520]  that should have been my first question.
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:39.520]  I mean I think just knowing the
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:41.520]  Republicans control the House and seem positive
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:43.520]  overall that this
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:45.520]  vote this afternoon is going to pass
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:47.520]  hopefully and then any word on how fast
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:49.520]  the president who gets to review that
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:51.520]  I mean because it'd be great
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:53.520]  for him to review it and then talk about it
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:55.520]  in the union tomorrow.
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:57.520]  Yeah I mean he gets five days
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:59.520]  in which to review the vote
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:01.520]  of the intelligence committee and he can make
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:03.520]  an objection during those five days
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:05.520]  but I don't expect him to. You know what
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.520]  I think would be very interesting Alex
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:09.520]  if during the State of the Union
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:11.520]  the president announced that he was
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:13.520]  supportive of the release of this memo
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:15.520]  following the intelligence committee's
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:17.520]  potential vote this evening. I think that
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:19.520]  would be just fantastic. It would be
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:21.520]  great for the country to see the president
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:23.520]  just matter to a close but also
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:25.520]  wanting the American people to have a look
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:27.520]  behind the curtain and see what's really going on
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:29.520]  in this country. It's the kind of populism
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:31.520]  that got Donald Trump elected
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:33.520]  always fighting for the regular folks and
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:35.520]  I think we're going to hear a lot of that in the State of the Union
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:37.520]  and this would be a really great component piece.
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:39.520]  Well MSM's going to attack you for coming
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.520]  on the show but that's a bad genre like the president's
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:43.520]  come on before because they're
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:45.520]  so discredited and after their whole
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:47.520]  Russiagate facade falls which I think
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.520]  is really already falling you can correct me if I'm wrong
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:51.520]  where are they going to go from here?
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:53.520]  I mean they have the fake dossier
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:55.520]  buzzfeed all this stuff they do
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:57.520]  the fake news and
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:59.520]  then now it turns out that the conspiracy
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:01.520]  was FBI and Justice Department collusion
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:03.520]  to try to stop him beginning the nomination
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:05.520]  stop him being seen as president
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:07.520]  now remove him from office when it's Hillary
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:09.520]  and all them up with their eyeballs with the Russian collusion.
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:11.520]  Honestly Alex
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:13.520]  that is a great question because
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:15.520]  I think we've won the argument with the American
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:17.520]  people as it relates to how conflicted
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:19.520]  the Mueller probe is
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:21.520]  I mean even Harvard University put out a poll
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:23.520]  that said over half of Americans think that the Mueller probe
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:25.520]  is infected with conflict of interest
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:27.520]  and you know Harvard usually
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:29.520]  leans pretty far to the left.
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:31.520]  Yeah I mean but I'll tell you this
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:33.520]  Alex the mainstream
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:35.520]  media has to find ways to divide us
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:37.520]  and so does the political left because
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:39.520]  if we focus on a growing economy
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:41.520]  tax cuts a regulatory
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:43.520]  environment that's working for the American people again
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:45.520]  I think that
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:47.520]  the people will be uplifted by this Trump presidency
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:49.520]  and by Republican control of the Congress
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:51.520]  and the mainstream media doesn't want to see that.
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:53.520]  That's my next question when clearly
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:55.520]  globalist policies had their foot
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:57.520]  on the neck of the country. Trump and you and others
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:14:59.520]  have just removed the foot and we're roaring back to life.
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:01.520]  How can the Grammys
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:03.520]  tanking the NFL tanking Hillary
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:05.520]  all this keep running
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:07.520]  on hating Trump when clearly
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:09.520]  he's pro-America clearly you are
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:11.520]  I mean people aren't going to go against their own interest.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:13.520]  No and that's
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:15.520]  why there has to be a constant
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:17.520]  distraction right. So we're about to have
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:19.520]  this immigration debate and look
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:21.520]  I mean there are elements of the president's blueprint
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:23.520]  that I like regarding border security there
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:25.520]  elements that I don't love but I
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:27.520]  suspect that the mainstream media the political
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:29.520]  left they'll have to go play the race card
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:31.520]  they'll have to use identity politics to divide
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:33.520]  people and I think reasonable voices
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:35.520]  will have to emerge and say no like we need
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:37.520]  an immigration policy that supports
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:39.520]  border security to support the rule of law in this country
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:41.520]  and I hope the president lays that out tomorrow Alex.
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:43.520]  All right we got a little bit of time left
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:45.520]  after this quick break with Congress from
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:47.520]  Matt Gaetz of Florida an impressive new crop
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:49.520]  of folks that are up there with real leadership
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:51.520]  this is amazing to see this country
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:53.520]  come back from the dead we'll be right back stay with us.
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:57.520]  Are you happy washing your hands with hard

[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:27.520]  The answer to being in control of your own
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:29.520]  health care is freedom from
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:31.520]  insurance. Become part of a group
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:33.520]  of self-pay patients that come together

[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:03.520]  wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:05.520]  listener of InfoWars and
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:07.520]  I just wanted to say that the t-shirts
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:09.520]  that you guys are offering are absolutely
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:11.520]  fantastic and that really
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:13.520]  is a great way to deal with this
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:15.520]  battle in the InfoWars. It might seem
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.520]  like a simple thing but they're particularly
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:19.520]  these slogan t-shirts that
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:21.520]  you guys got up right now are
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:23.520]  absolutely amazing. Well thank you, my favorite
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:25.520]  new one is the
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:27.520]  don't tread on me but said it says won't
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:29.520]  tread on me and it's a big day glow snake
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:31.520]  gads and snake and then it's got the
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:33.520]  American flag, infowars.com on the right
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:35.520]  arm. I mean that's a great way just to
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:37.520]  meet like-minded people
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:39.520]  and spread the word and also exercise
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:41.520]  free speech and the newest one is
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:43.520]  Trigger Warning T-Shirt
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:45.520]  Trigger Warning T-Shirt
[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:47.520]  which is the symbol of a trigger with
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:49.520]  a yield sign and then infowars.com
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:51.520]  on the back. That is the new
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:53.520]  shirt of the month available

[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:57.520]  InfoWars Wipe is bringing
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:59.520]  you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:01.520]  We have found extraordinary new
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:03.520]  natural way to help alleviate
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:05.520]  seasonal distress symptoms including
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:07.520]  promoting clear nasal and sinus
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:09.520]  passageways, eye comfort and respiratory
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:11.520]  health and normal breathing.
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:13.520]  This is pollen blood.
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:15.520]  In the 1960s researchers in France noticed
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:17.520]  that people who ate certain quail eggs
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:19.520]  from specific farms experienced
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:21.520]  less seasonal distress symptoms
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:23.520]  like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:25.520]  and excessive mucus production.
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:27.520]  They began studying the effects
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:29.520]  in published trials, in their
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:31.520]  published trials. Now we are introducing
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:33.520]  the fruit of the research, a fast acting
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:35.520]  chewable tablet, just two
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:37.520]  tablets at the first sign
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:39.520]  of seasonal distress and fast acting
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:41.520]  pollen block starts working
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:43.520]  in about 15 minutes to help alleviate
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:45.520]  seasonal distress. Enjoy the
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:47.520]  air you breathe naturally with fast acting
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:49.520]  pollen block available now
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:51.520]  at infowarslife.com
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:53.520]  or by calling toll 3. Triple A
[02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:55.520]  3533139
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:01.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:23.520]  show.
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:25.520]  It's the Alex Jones show, tomorrow's news
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:27.520]  today.
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:29.520]  Alright, I gotta say rising star in
[02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:31.520]  the Republican Party, I know that he's one
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:33.520]  of my favorite people to watch on Fox News
[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:35.520]  or even on CNN, got five minutes left
[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:37.520]  with Matt Gaetz, Matt Gaetz
[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:39.520]  dot com, Gaetz spell G-A-E-T-Z
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:41.520]  Matt Gaetz dot com, you can follow him
[02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:43.520]  on Twitter, all the rest of it, and that's critical.
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:45.520]  We had a great discussion during that
[02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:47.520]  three and a half minute break. Let's just go
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:49.520]  through it. What happens as their house
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:51.520]  of cards falls? They've shown they never give
[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:53.520]  up.
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:55.520]  Well you're right about that Alex, but they're
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:57.520]  going to be like cornered rats when this
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:20:59.520]  entire investigation is shown
[02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:01.520]  to be the fraud that it is.
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:03.520]  It's built on a rotten foundation
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:05.520]  and I suspect that they'll have
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:07.520]  to go into major defense mode
[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:09.520]  over Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:11.520]  There's a lot of people that paid bribes
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:13.520]  to the Clinton Foundation that still
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:15.520]  may be getting a benefit out of this
[02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:17.520]  government and when they find out that
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:19.520]  their house of cards is falling, we may
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:21.520]  see a very strong reaction and they'll have
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:23.520]  to really start to explain themselves because
[02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:25.520]  the president's shown one thing, he's willing
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:27.520]  to drain his swamp in this town.
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:29.520]  That's right, no lobbyist in there and that's
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:31.520]  why they're panicking.
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:33.520]  2018 they say is everything. We secured
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:35.520]  the beachhead like Normandy,
[02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:37.520]  but we've got to actually go into Germany
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:39.520]  here to use that World War II analogy.
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:41.520]  So let's talk about 2018.
[02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:43.520]  Well, Trump voters
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:45.520]  have to have a reason to come out and vote for
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:47.520]  Republicans in a world in which Donald Trump's
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:49.520]  not going to be on the ballot, Alex. And so
[02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:51.520]  the question is, will Republicans stand
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:53.520]  by the Trump agenda? Will we help this
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:55.520]  president get major things accomplished
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:57.520]  like we did on tax reform?
[02:21:57.520 --> 02:21:59.520]  Or in this next year is it going to be more
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:01.520]  like the Obamacare fiasco where
[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:03.520]  unfortunately we weren't able to do that
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:05.520]  because of some people in the Senate,
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:07.520]  primarily Republicans abandoning
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:09.520]  this president. And so I think that if we
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:11.520]  stand behind our standard bearer, if we
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.520]  fight for his agenda, for a stronger border,
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:15.520]  for infrastructure, for tax cuts,
[02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:17.520]  we'll see this economy take off and Trump
[02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:19.520]  voters will come out. If we see more of
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:21.520]  like what we see out of Lindsey Graham
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:23.520]  and Colin's and Lisa Murkowski
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:25.520]  and sometimes Mitch McConnell, then I
[02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:27.520]  fear we may be in for a real tough
[02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:29.520]  cycle. So it's all to us.
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:31.520]  We have the power to control our destiny if we'll
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:33.520]  fight with this president. Well, that's right.
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:35.520]  The left is bragging. Okay, libertarians,
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:37.520]  conservatives, nationalists, populists, they woke up.
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:39.520]  They're taking over worldwide, but it doesn't matter.
[02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:41.520]  Now we've mobilized and
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:43.520]  they're really stealing elections. They are
[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:45.520]  boiling out of their rat holes.
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:47.520]  People need to know, hey, this was just phase one.
[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:49.520]  It's kind of like a football game. We've won
[02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:51.520]  the first half.
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:53.520]  And now we're coming out of the bunkers here.
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:55.520]  This is the real fight here in the second half.
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:57.520]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:59.520]  Because if we lose the house,
[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:01.520]  Nancy Pelosi will have Donald Trump impeached
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:03.520]  by this house within 90 days of taking
[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:05.520]  the gavel. I firmly believe that.
[02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:07.520]  And so that's why the house is so important.
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:09.520]  And then in the Senate, we find too often
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:11.520]  that there's this sense of collegiality
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:13.520]  and deference to one another
[02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:15.520]  that really erodes democracy,
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:17.520]  erodes majority rule.
[02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:19.520]  I think we need a new voice and the huddle
[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:21.520]  in the Senate. I think that we need some leaders
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:23.520]  in the United States Senate to stand up and fight
[02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:25.520]  for this president's agenda and fight for
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:27.520]  conservative reform. They did that on tax
[02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:29.520]  cuts. And I think that they should be
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:31.520]  commended for it. Now let's get back and start
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:33.520]  working on some of these entitlements
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:35.520]  that are hollowing out the economic future
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:37.520]  of this country. Let's get back and actually
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:39.520]  secure the border. Let's do e-verify.
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:41.520]  Let's end chain migration.
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:43.520]  I think if we can get a Senate behind those
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:45.520]  priorities, we'll have a great 2018.
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:47.520]  But if they fail to do the conservative
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:49.520]  things we promised to our voters,
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:51.520]  then I suspect voters who are Trump
[02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:53.520]  fans may not come out for the election.
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:55.520]  But you're right. It's critically important
[02:23:55.520 --> 02:23:57.520]  to get the agenda done.
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:23:59.520]  I got to say, and I'm not a cheerleader.
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.520]  I'm a cheerleader for the truth.
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:03.520]  Trump has overdelivered it one year.
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:05.520]  He did more than Reagan ever did in three or four.
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:07.520]  And I love Reagan. I mean, it was dramatic.
[02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:09.520]  They call it gridlock. He ran over the gridlock.
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:11.520]  I mean, all the things we got,
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:13.520]  procedurally wounding Obamacare, the tax cuts,
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:15.520]  the border, taking care of the military.
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:17.520]  I mean, all the things we've seen, the jobs,
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:19.520]  the stock market. I mean, if America
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:21.520]  doesn't double down and realize Trump's got
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:23.520]  our back, we've got to get his back.
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:25.520]  We deserve what happens. In closing, the minute
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:27.520]  we've got left, Congressman Gates from Florida
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:29.520]  stay to the union. We've seen year one
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:31.520]  about delivering. Trump says, hey,
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:33.520]  I've just got it started. What do you expect
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:35.520]  to hear in the state of the union tomorrow night?
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:37.520]  I expect the president
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:39.520]  to offer a unifying message.
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:41.520]  I expect a real focus on infrastructure
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:43.520]  and about the economic conditions
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:45.520]  people find themselves in.
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:47.520]  Because the mainstream media can lie
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:49.520]  and they can cheat and they can distort
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:51.520]  and they can take things out of context
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:53.520]  and sensationalize all kind of drama
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:55.520]  that goes on here in Washington.
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:57.520]  But what the mainstream media can't lie about
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:24:59.520]  is the amount of money in people's paychecks.
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:01.520]  And I think that the president is going to talk
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:03.520]  to over 2 million Americans
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:05.520]  that have already seen their wages rise.
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:07.520]  They've already seen bonuses in their bank accounts.
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:09.520]  And he's going to talk about the economic condition
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:11.520]  of the American people.
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:13.520]  And I think ultimately that will
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:15.520]  unify our party and it should unify the country.
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:17.520]  That's right. There's a really question that
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:19.520]  people are awake. They should deliver to action.
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:21.520]  I've got to ask this last question. I know you're not a vindictive guy
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:23.520]  and neither am I. Napoleon got
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:25.520]  sent off to Alba. But Hillary
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:27.520]  and the globalists have committed all these crimes.
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:29.520]  There should be more investigations. Something should be done.
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:31.520]  They're always going to come back if we don't.
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:33.520]  Is somebody going to get indicted
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:35.520]  over the made up Russiagate crimes
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:37.520]  trying to frustrate voters
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:39.520]  and all the crazy stuff we've seen.
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:41.520]  The money,
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:43.520]  the former FBI director McCabe's wife
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:45.520]  getting a half million. The president's talked about it.
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:47.520]  What needs to happen just in closing?
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:49.520]  Well, there have been incredible media reports
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:51.520]  that the Little Rock Field Office
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.520]  is actually investigating elements
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:55.520]  of bribery and corruption with the Clinton Foundation,
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:57.520]  particularly as it relates
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:25:59.520]  to uranium sales
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:01.520]  that may not have been in our nation's interest.
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:03.520]  And I think that should really worry Hillary Clinton
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:05.520]  and some of the people who were
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:07.520]  paying money for influence within the Clinton
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:09.520]  world because
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:11.520]  this is not going to be a politically
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:13.520]  predetermined outcome made by a bunch
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:15.520]  of political bureaucrats
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:17.520]  at the head shed at the FBI. This is going
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:19.520]  to be frontline work done by real field
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:21.520]  agents out in the Little Rock Field Office
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:23.520]  and they should be concerned because
[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:25.520]  justice may be coming to their doorsteps very soon.
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:27.520]  Wow, so it looks like
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:29.520]  Clinton world is coming to an end
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:31.520]  as America and the real world comes back.
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:33.520]  Wow, Matt Gaetz really impressed
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:35.520]  with what you're doing. Matt Gaetz.com
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:37.520]  thanks for joining us here in the info war.
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:39.520]  Thank you.
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:41.520]  All right, there goes the congressman.
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:43.520]  Thank you so much congressman. Wow.
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:45.520]  Matt Gaetz.com, I'm Alex Jones with
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:47.520]  infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:49.520]  We're going to go to break here
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:51.520]  in just a few minutes, but I tell you
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:53.520]  I remember Stone a couple years ago and Matt Gaetz
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:55.520]  Matt Gaetz, we're running him for congress.
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:57.520]  Oh, he's the best, blah, blah, blah. You're going to love him.
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:59.520]  This guy's going to be a hard charger.
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:01.520]  This guy's going to be, you watch this guy
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:03.520]  and there it is. I mean, it's just like
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:05.520]  amazing. And that is not the congressman
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:07.520]  that I talked to about the memos
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:09.520]  two weeks ago or
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:11.520]  Jack Mesub at the talks with another congressman
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:13.520]  or Roger Stone that had dinner with three congressmen
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:15.520]  to tell you what was in the memo. And again,
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:17.520]  you're talking to people writing notes like, okay, it's the memo.
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:19.520]  Okay, it does this. Okay, it's a blueprint.
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:21.520]  It's a roadmap to all the stuff they've done
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:23.520]  and proves perjury in the general
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:25.520]  Pfizer memo.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:27.520]  And then all of a sudden a week later
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:29.520]  William Benning, the former technical head
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:31.520]  of the NSA goes, oh, this document, no one's
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:33.520]  paying attention. This is the memo and it is the memo.
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:35.520]  And then it's part of
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:37.520]  the larger memo they're writing about
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:39.520]  the Pfizer court that then nexuses
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:41.520]  them all in with that into
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:43.520]  how they perjured themselves.
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:45.520]  And I have trouble. It's a big investigation
[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:47.520]  getting my mind around that. But I mean, it's crystal
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:49.520]  clear. But again, then they play
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:51.520]  some radical games about what's in it.
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:53.520]  It's going to destroy
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:55.520]  them. And that's why my Spidey
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:57.520]  since I could barely sleep last night, even
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:27:59.520]  though I was a good boy
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:01.520]  and try to go to bed early and everything, I rolled around
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:03.520]  a bunch of welcome middle and I was doing research for
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:05.520]  hours and I only can't sleep
[02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:07.520]  when big stuff's about to happen because, man,
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:09.520]  we're relaunching the Republic right now.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:11.520]  We are.
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:13.520]  And again, it doesn't mean I'm perfect or you're
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:15.520]  perfect, but we're not out to hurt
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:17.520]  you. My intent
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:19.520]  is justice and prosperity.
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:21.520]  It doesn't mean I've got to suppress
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:23.520]  some of my evil side sometimes
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:25.520]  when people are messing with me. But I love God.
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:27.520]  I love God.
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:29.520]  And I know I'm a sinner. That's the difference. These people
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:31.520]  don't even know they're evil. They're just running while
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:33.520]  like foaming at the mouth about everything
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:35.520]  and it just gets worse and worse and crazier and crazier
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:37.520]  because they're megalomaniacs. They have no
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:39.520]  governors because they're not powerful.
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:41.520]  How really innately powerful
[02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:43.520]  people have governors because
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:45.520]  they understand
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:47.520]  what can happen. But scumbags don't.
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:49.520]  Your calls and a ton of breaking news and clips
[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:51.520]  from the news conference coming up
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:55.520]  straight ahead.
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:23.520]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:25.520]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:27.520]  I've defended people from the IRS
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:29.520]  for over 30 years.
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:31.520]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:33.520]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement
[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:35.520]  and I'm telling you there's no such thing
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:37.520]  as a hopeless case. Call
[02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:39.520]  800-34-NO-TAX
[02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:41.520]  to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:43.520]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been
[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:45.520]  a better time to solve your problem.
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:47.520]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:49.520]  that's 800-34-NO-TAX
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:51.520]  or my website,
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:30:20.520]  DanPilla.com.
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:53.520]  You know, I've got some
[02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:55.520]  talking points here about
[02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:57.520]  caveman from infowarslife.com
[02:30:57.520 --> 02:30:59.520]  but instead of going with those talking points
[02:30:59.520 --> 02:31:01.520]  let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:31:01.520 --> 02:31:03.520]  From all the wives' tales in every culture
[02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:05.520]  we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:07.520]  We know chicken noodle soup.
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:09.520]  It's great for people that are sick.
[02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:11.520]  Again, in every culture this has been reported
[02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:13.520]  because it works.
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:15.520]  And there's no way to quantify
[02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:17.520]  how strong this is.
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:19.520]  But the amount of bones that
[02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:21.520]  we have, how strong this is,
[02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:23.520]  but the amount of bone protein
[02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:25.520]  and the amount of marrow
[02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:27.520]  and the amount of concentrated
[02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:29.520]  life force that is in this
[02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:31.520]  is incredible.
[02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:33.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints
[02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:35.520]  whether it's for your arteries and your veins
[02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:37.520]  whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy
[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:39.520]  this, ladies and gentlemen
[02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:41.520]  is the strongest, most concentrated
[02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:43.520]  bone broth formula out there
[02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:45.520]  and it's amazing.
[02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:47.520]  Find out for yourself today
[02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:49.520]  at www.infowarslife.com
[02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:51.520]  what it can do for your family
[02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:53.520]  and again I want to thank you all for your support
[02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:55.520]  you are funding the Information War
[02:31:55.520 --> 02:32:18.520]  www.infowarslife.com
[02:32:25.520 --> 02:32:53.520]  www.infowarslife.com
[02:32:53.520 --> 02:33:03.520]  www.infowarslife.com
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:33.520]  www.infowarslife.com
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:35.520]  You know they say that pride goes
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:37.520]  before a fall
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:39.520]  in the Bible and I agree with that
[02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:41.520]  and I wouldn't call it pride
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:43.520]  it's not pride in myself
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:45.520]  pride
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:47.520]  arrogance, self-arrogance is evil
[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:49.520]  but having pride
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:51.520]  in your family
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:53.520]  having pride
[02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:55.520]  in successes we've had
[02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:57.520]  is a celebration
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:33:59.520]  so pride isn't the right word
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:01.520]  so I don't know what you call it
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:03.520]  but man I'm really proud
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:05.520]  of our audience
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:07.520]  and I know that sounds
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:09.520]  patronizing when I come on air
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:11.520]  and say that but
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:13.520]  whenever these families
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:17.520]  of every race, color and creed
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:19.520]  all the human race come up to me
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:21.520]  with my hand and thank me for things
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:27.520]  it's like getting punched
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:29.520]  in the stomach
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:31.520]  in that
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:33.520]  I feel like I'm not worthy
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:35.520]  to have this much attention or thanks
[02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:37.520]  I took my daughters
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:39.520]  and one of their friends out
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:41.520]  with my wife to dinner
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:43.520]  Friday night at a
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:45.520]  Argentinian steakhouse
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:47.520]  and
[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:49.520]  our dinner was probably pretty expensive
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:51.520]  and somebody bought our dinner
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:53.520]  and that happens all the time
[02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:55.520]  and I'm looking around who did it
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:57.520]  and they're already gone
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:34:59.520]  and it just makes me
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:01.520]  it's just
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:03.520]  because I guarantee you the people that bought me my dinner
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:05.520]  are probably smarter than I am
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:07.520]  more eloquent
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:09.520]  and can even do a better job
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:11.520]  all I'm saying is all this success we have
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:13.520]  all this power
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:15.520]  and it's the opposite
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:17.520]  but I do have pride
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:19.520]  in you
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:21.520]  and that's why I always say to people
[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:23.520]  well thanks for putting up with me because
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:25.520]  sometimes I tune into my own show later to re-hear it
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:27.520]  I don't like doing it and it's like wow that was really good
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:29.520]  other times I go man you sound like
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:31.520]  a sped up jibbering moron
[02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:33.520]  and all I'm saying is
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:35.520]  I want you to know I appreciate you
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:37.520]  and I was just thinking
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:39.520]  during the break
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:41.520]  about how far we've come
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:43.520]  all over the world people are waking up
[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:45.520]  and taking action against these big centralized
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:47.520]  corporate combines
[02:35:47.520 --> 02:35:49.520]  and they're taking action
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:51.520]  against all these really really evil people
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:53.520]  and Trump's taking action
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:55.520]  as best he can
[02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:57.520]  I'm surprised he's gotten this much done
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:59.520]  people can point at things that aren't perfect
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:01.520]  well he's not a dictator
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:03.520]  and even if he was a dictator that caused its own problems
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:05.520]  we don't want that
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:09.520]  it's just an amazing time to be alive right now
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:11.520]  that's all I'm saying
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:13.520]  and
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:15.520]  the people I've gotten to meet doing this
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:17.520]  and the things I've been through
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:21.520]  even though I get attacked
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:23.520]  and lied about and persecuted behind the scenes
[02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:25.520]  I actually get guilty
[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:29.520]  that I'm so resigned even though I love my children
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:31.520]  more than life itself
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:33.520]  I love my own life
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:35.520]  as well but
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:37.520]  not as much as I want to stop the globalist
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:39.520]  not as much as in general
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:41.520]  the planet isn't going to make it
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:43.520]  and we're not going to make it as a species
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:45.520]  if we don't defeat these people
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:47.520]  and that's what I'm getting at
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:49.520]  that's what I'm getting at
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:51.520]  is that it's that real
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:53.520]  feeling that's beyond a feeling
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:55.520]  it's a knowing in your bones
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:57.520]  that you've got to do this
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:59.520]  no matter what
[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:01.520]  you've got to take action
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:03.520]  you've got to commit
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:05.520]  you've got to put everything
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:07.520]  your family, your life
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:09.520]  everything on the line
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.520]  or there's no future
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:13.520]  because the death of our species
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:15.520]  the death of everything we've been through
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:17.520]  will be the death of our ancestors
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:19.520]  and the death of us and the death of our progeny
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:21.520]  that is the death
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:23.520]  of our species
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:25.520]  and it's so clear
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:27.520]  that evil people have bought into
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:29.520]  a spirit
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:31.520]  that's invaded our world as the Bible says
[02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:33.520]  to try to get people to sell out
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:35.520]  to suppress their own humans
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:37.520]  for the promise of some godhood
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:39.520]  you're never going to receive
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:41.520]  this Luciferian enlightenment
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:43.520]  that you believe
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:45.520]  this Luciferian fire that you believe
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:47.520]  is going to help you become transcendent
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:49.520]  by being selfish
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:51.520]  and by
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:53.520]  dumbing down your fellow humans
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:57.520]  but that's the message
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:37:59.520]  you've got to prove how strong you are
[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:01.520]  in survival of the fittest
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:03.520]  these rough horrible things with people
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:05.520]  and then out of that nightmare
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:07.520]  will rise this Uber mention
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:09.520]  when at the base level
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:11.520]  you're not trying to give rise
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:13.520]  to amazing humans
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:15.520]  you're trying to suppress everybody
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:17.520]  so that you the fallen
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:19.520]  can rule over us
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:21.520]  it's a lie
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:23.520]  they create an atmosphere to make us weak
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:25.520]  to make us pathetic
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:27.520]  to make us passive
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:29.520]  to make us go along
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:31.520]  and then they go
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:33.520]  oh, we're doing all this
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:35.520]  see what comes out of the mud
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:37.520]  the lily
[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:41.520]  all I know is
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:43.520]  the spirit that comes out of DC
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:45.520]  the spirit that comes out of Los Angeles
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:47.520]  the spirit that comes out of their systems
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:49.520]  is cold, alone
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:51.520]  destitute
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:53.520]  poverty-stricken
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:55.520]  shrunken, starving
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:57.520]  howling, freezing
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:38:59.520]  dead
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:01.520]  and I
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:03.520]  have tasted that spirit and I don't want any part of it
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:07.520]  you know the devil
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:09.520]  is able to masquerade
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:11.520]  as this engine
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:13.520]  of life like wild sex
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:15.520]  and strength and will
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:17.520]  and talent comes out of the devil
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:19.520]  now the devil the system takes control
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:21.520]  of your mind and it makes you think
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:23.520]  your natural talents come from
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:25.520]  the system when the system
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:27.520]  is there leaching off you
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:29.520]  using you to empower
[02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:31.520]  its structure
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:35.520]  we're going to go to Mark and Sam
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:37.520]  and Marcos and Forrest and many others
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:39.520]  Tim and Seattle that congressman Gates
[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:41.520]  interview that we just had earlier
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:43.520]  was powerful I mean he said
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:45.520]  the Clinton crime network are cornered
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:47.520]  rats that are going down
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:49.520]  he said
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:53.520]  that there's credible reports
[02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:55.520]  he's got that the FBI and Little Rock
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:57.520]  is investigating the Clinton
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:39:59.520]  library and foundation
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:03.520]  and that he believes they will
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:05.520]  vote to release the memo and the president
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:07.520]  will talk about
[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:09.520]  how he's going to release the memo at the state of the union tomorrow night
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:11.520]  and he's telling you what he's heard
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:13.520]  he's like he's not saying it's going to happen
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:15.520]  because the thing can change he goes I'd like to see
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:17.520]  how like Jim Jordan
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:19.520]  you know I bet you guys went and met with McCabe
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:21.520]  and fixed all this fate made up intelligence
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:23.520]  as a plan to have an insurance policy
[02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:27.520]  and before this stuff had even come out
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:29.520]  Rosency and the deputy attorney general is going
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:31.520]  talk about that he's telling him
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:33.520]  I've got the secret documents they're coming out
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:35.520]  what are you going to do on the hot seat
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:37.520]  I mean just to finally
[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:39.520]  because I didn't want to get Gates on
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:41.520]  normally getting congresspeople on that's boring nobody cares
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:43.520]  I don't want to get Gates on and kiss his ass and say oh my god
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:45.520]  thank god for Jim Jordan
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:47.520]  thank god for Tray got it thank god for Devin Nunes
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:49.520]  thank god for you but I mean thank god
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:51.520]  for him if we didn't have those
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:53.520]  patriots that got into the freedom caucus
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:55.520]  that are died in the world
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:57.520]  patriots we wouldn't
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:59.520]  even have a shot right now
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:01.520]  with a bunch of candy ass
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:03.520]  people out there
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:05.520]  and I'm proud of the fact I've back
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:07.520]  Rand Paul he went sideways during the
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:09.520]  campaign thought he was established but when
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:11.520]  they knew he was an establishment
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:13.520]  now he's back great I love Rand Paul
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:15.520]  this is what this is all about
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:17.520]  man it's retaking who we are
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:19.520]  standing up
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:21.520]  and saying listen
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:23.520]  I don't have all the answers and I'm not looking for power
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:25.520]  but you're not going to run my life
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:27.520]  so you want to feel some power
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:29.520]  I'm going to kick you like a horse upside your head
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:31.520]  and then I'm going to keep coming back
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:33.520]  at you till the end because this fight
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:35.520]  is all I got I can't roll over
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:37.520]  in some ditch and show my belly
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:39.520]  to you wolves and let you pull my guts out
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:41.520]  from my rear end
[02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:43.520]  you want to fight me it's going to be swinging
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:45.520]  fists and I'm going to be biting and I'm going to be attacking
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:47.520]  till the last blood pumps out of that heart
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:49.520]  and when my eyes roll up in my head
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:51.520]  I'm going to be dead and you're not going to have me
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:53.520]  strapped up against some wall
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:55.520]  having your way with me
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:41:59.520]  like I've discovered you wanted me to be
[02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:01.520]  under your control
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:03.520]  in your hands right there
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:05.520]  but God delivered me one more time
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:07.520]  and I'm sure
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:09.520]  in my gut because God's already told me
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:11.520]  I already know it my spirit
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:13.520]  God tells you this is the choice that you have
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:15.520]  and that I will be made an example of
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:17.520]  in the end
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:19.520]  I will be destroyed in front of everybody
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:21.520]  but that will be the victory
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:23.520]  and I personally am not looking for that
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:25.520]  but I know that's what it really takes
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:27.520]  to go the long
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:29.520]  mile to not stop
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:31.520]  to be the winter soldier
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:33.520]  not the sunshine patriot
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:35.520]  and I'll tell you
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:37.520]  I don't feel sorry for myself
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:39.520]  feeling like that I feel so honored
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:41.520]  it brings tears to my eyes
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:43.520]  thank God
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:45.520]  we're not with these devil worshipers and pedophiles
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:47.520]  thank God you're with God
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:49.520]  thank God you're awake

[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:53.520]  I'm so excited
[02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:55.520]  the new product
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:57.520]  at infowarslife.com
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:43:59.520]  in a glass bottle
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:01.520]  two months servings
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:03.520]  filled to the brim
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:05.520]  filled to the absolute top
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:07.520]  the real red pill

[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:11.520]  a new tropic
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:13.520]  but it doesn't have any stimulants in it
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:15.520]  but boy does it stimulate
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:17.520]  because it's beyond that
[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:19.520]  quite frankly I just went off
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:21.520]  to the doctor's
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:23.520]  prescribing to their patients
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:25.520]  but it wasn't prescription
[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:27.520]  but they were charging people $100-$200
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:29.520]  for the formulae
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:31.520]  and I came up with our own formula

[02:47:19.520 --> 02:47:21.520]  well, it's happened again
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:23.520]  it happens every day, basically
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:25.520]  an off-duty cop shoots a driver
[02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:27.520]  attempting to run over pedestrians
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:29.520]  Philadelphia police say
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:31.520]  his name ends up being
[02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:33.520]  you're not going to see that in the media
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:35.520]  a man who allegedly attempted to ram pedestrians
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:37.520]  with his black Honda on Monday morning
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:39.520]  in Philadelphia, critically injured one person
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:41.520]  before being shot and killed by an off-duty cop
[02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:43.520]  the driver who was not immediately identified
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:45.520]  was taken to Presbyterian Medical Center
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:47.520]  the gunshot wound to the head
[02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:49.520]  and was dead soon after arriving
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:51.520]  too bad
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:53.520]  I'm going back to your calls ahead of
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:55.520]  Joe Gilbert
[02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:57.520]  hosting my next hour, I'm going to host part of that with him
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:47:59.520]  I'm going to play part of the Sanders press conference
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:01.520]  on McCabe too
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:03.520]  so we'll have Gilbert take over about 15 after
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:05.520]  I'm going to go to your calls though
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:07.520]  just briefly because they're reminding me to do this
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:09.520]  and I barely do it
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:11.520]  if you don't buy products at infowarsstore.com
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:13.520]  we don't continue on, we shut down
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:15.520]  because they've taken our sponsors, everybody knows what they've done
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:17.520]  they're great products, you've been liking them
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:19.520]  you've been reordering them
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:21.520]  if you're a listener that's been on the fence
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:23.520]  infowarsstore.com
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:25.520]  that is how you get great products
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:27.520]  and most importantly, stick your thumb
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:29.520]  in the eye of the globalist
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:31.520]  and promote free speech
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:33.520]  and defy their system of total control
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:35.520]  we've got to end this special
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:37.520]  in a couple days, we've got $50
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:39.520]  off on the Alexa Pure Breeze
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:41.520]  air filtration system, four phase
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:43.520]  the last phase ION filter
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:45.520]  leading competitors are $400 to $600
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:47.520]  just a few years ago
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:49.520]  leading competitors were $800 to $1000
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:51.520]  the prices are going down
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:53.520]  we used to sell it for like $250 to $300
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:55.520]  now, they've got costs down
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:57.520]  so it's normally $200, it's $149
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:48:59.520]  we've got
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:01.520]  $479 reviews
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:03.520]  we're talking about
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:05.520]  $4.9 stars, it's unbelievable
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:07.520]  it's the very best unit out there
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:09.520]  that helps fund our operation
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:11.520]  and like I said, I think they make it for like $80 bucks
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:13.520]  we like split between $80
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:15.520]  something dollars and that
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:17.520]  I think we make like 30-40 bucks on it at that deal
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:19.520]  we've got to sell a lot of these
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:21.520]  to fund this operation but I believe in
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:23.520]  selling you the very best products
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:25.520]  at the very lowest prices
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:27.520]  because that's how I want to be traded
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:29.520]  and you've responded
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:31.520]  we sell unbelievable amounts of stuff
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:33.520]  but it's like, if you have a graph of like 90%
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:35.520]  you know, is the cost and everything
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:37.520]  and a little 10% up here for us to
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:39.520]  fund things, we have to sell a crap ton
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:41.520]  we've got stuff even lower than
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:43.520]  Amazon and better systems
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:45.520]  so again, Bezos hates you
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:47.520]  wants your guns, wants to go over to the president
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:49.520]  gets funded
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:51.520]  by taxpayers for free shipping
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:53.520]  if you want taxpayer money for free shipping, go to Amazon
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:55.520]  we can't do it all the time, we do it sometimes
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:57.520]  it's not free shipping right now
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:59.520]  M4store.com, it's just up to you what you want to do
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:01.520]  we have the M4's mind body pack
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:03.520]  that's the vitamin mineral fusion
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:05.520]  fruit punch, multivitamin and amino acid
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:07.520]  and then a brain force
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:09.520]  that's 40% off together
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:11.520]  we've got the new

[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:19.520]  because they are selling out
[02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:21.520]  but you built M4 so
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:23.520]  I'm not complaining, every time we get attacked
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:25.520]  people just come through
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:27.520]  let me tell you something, I'm not going to belabor this
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:29.520]  but let me tell you, we're getting called
[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:31.520]  by up to 10
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:33.520]  TV stations a day
[02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:35.520]  and
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:37.520]  we are getting the satellites they want
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:39.520]  and I'm not going to list the stations that are calling us
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:41.520]  these are, some of them are
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:43.520]  the
[02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:45.520]  top three, we've gotten two calls
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:49.520]  from TV broadcast stations
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:51.520]  that are
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:53.520]  in the top three in the country
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:55.520]  and I remembered why I even said this
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:50:59.520]  that the owner of one of these was putting
[02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:01.520]  my films on years ago and I thought
[02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:03.520]  I remember in a meeting like three years ago I go I bet stations like that will pick us up
[02:51:03.520 --> 02:51:05.520]  and now that
[02:51:05.520 --> 02:51:07.520]  the owner is calling up
[02:51:07.520 --> 02:51:09.520]  in one of the most popular cities in the country
[02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:11.520]  west coast
[02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:13.520]  because
[02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:15.520]  people want to make a big splash
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:17.520]  now, they want to really change things, they get the fights on
[02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:19.520]  and
[02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:21.520]  I don't even want to go on air and tell listeners
[02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:23.520]  this really positive stuff because the enemy listens
[02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:25.520]  they know we don't lie
[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:27.520]  we make mistakes but we don't lie
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:29.520]  Paul Watson goes we defeated YouTube
[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:31.520]  we defeated all this, we have the most impressions we're winning
[02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:33.520]  and they have like a hundred articles the next week going
[02:51:33.520 --> 02:51:35.520]  they admit they're winning, ban them
[02:51:35.520 --> 02:51:37.520]  and then they started restricting us so
[02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:41.520]  I'm not going to fly out of the radar anymore though
[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:43.520]  and I'm not going to sit here
[02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:45.520]  and not tell you that
[02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:47.520]  it's a lot of money to spend a million
[02:51:47.520 --> 02:51:49.520]  and a half dollars on three satellites we need
[02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:51.520]  and the closed captioning and all the rest of stuff
[02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:53.520]  to go 24 hours a day but
[02:51:53.520 --> 02:51:55.520]  we are going to reach
[02:51:57.520 --> 02:51:59.520]  it looks like hundreds
[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:01.520]  and hundreds of UHF
[02:52:01.520 --> 02:52:03.520]  and VHF and hundreds of cable stations
[02:52:03.520 --> 02:52:05.520]  we're already on
[02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:07.520]  40 plus we count cable and TV
[02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:09.520]  without even trying, this is so exciting right now
[02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:11.520]  and nobody's ever done this
[02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:13.520]  because I just do it in my head, I don't want my own vanity channel
[02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:15.520]  no one watches that
[02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:17.520]  I want to beam direct about the TV
[02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:19.520]  and cable themselves and be on
[02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:21.520]  the lower peg
[02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:23.520]  the lower channels that all the viewers
[02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:25.520]  you're not going to just have
[02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:27.520]  reruns of bonanza
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:29.520]  reruns of the rifleman which is fine
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:31.520]  you're going to have Alex Jones
[02:52:31.520 --> 02:52:33.520]  24 hours a day
[02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:35.520]  can you imagine on
[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:37.520]  people have never gotten this, it's already happening
[02:52:37.520 --> 02:52:39.520]  the stations are getting, the word
[02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:41.520]  see it's coming to the industry, they're getting ratings
[02:52:41.520 --> 02:52:43.520]  they're getting sponsors, this is the other big secret
[02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:45.520]  and Ted was cool on this
[02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:47.520]  because I have my own show on my show
[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:49.520]  but GCN, I said listen
[02:52:49.520 --> 02:52:51.520]  you can keep having half the ads on the radio
[02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:53.520]  because I don't even really deal with those but I said
[02:52:53.520 --> 02:52:55.520]  I'm going to give our TV affiliates
[02:52:55.520 --> 02:52:57.520]  free to air, that means the 15 minutes
[02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:59.520]  of commercial space is all theirs
[02:52:59.520 --> 02:53:01.520]  and I'll do a few minutes an hour plugging myself
[02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:03.520]  I want the stations to have that
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:05.520]  no one's done it and the word went out
[02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:07.520]  free to air and it has just been amazing
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:09.520]  it's almost left GCN a few months ago
[02:53:09.520 --> 02:53:11.520]  I said you know
[02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:13.520]  I'll put you guys on the map, all your shows are great
[02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:15.520]  whatever, Ted's a great guy
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:17.520]  but I just said
[02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:19.520]  my show, I'm doing it
[02:53:19.520 --> 02:53:21.520]  all the rest of it and
[02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:23.520]  I'm free to air
[02:53:23.520 --> 02:53:25.520]  radio, it's still not free to air
[02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:27.520]  that's one reason I think about leaving GCN
[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:29.520]  I want to tell our radio stations
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:31.520]  because imagine if I told
[02:53:31.520 --> 02:53:33.520]  our radio stations you are free to air
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:35.520]  you get all the ads, we get an additional
[02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:37.520]  200 affiliates in like a month
[02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:39.520]  and then maybe I say oh then you know
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:41.520]  Ted, I'll give you a couple minutes of ads
[02:53:41.520 --> 02:53:43.520]  where I plug during the show but I don't need to do that
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:45.520]  and I love Ted, I love all those guys
[02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:47.520]  I just communicate out in the open about all this stuff
[02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:49.520]  this is the kind of stuff where my loyalty
[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:51.520]  is so intense
[02:53:51.520 --> 02:53:53.520]  that I let it get in the way of progress
[02:53:53.520 --> 02:53:55.520]  because I'm not even being disloyal
[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:57.520]  and see now I'm ranting, I haven't gone to your calls
[02:53:57.520 --> 02:53:59.520]  that's the things we're
[02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:01.520]  involved in, that's the things we're doing
[02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:03.520]  and I mean 10 stations a day
[02:54:03.520 --> 02:54:05.520]  and I mean it's like
[02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:07.520]  New York, LA, Miami
[02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:09.520]  they're like
[02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:11.520]  we're ready but we don't like the satellite you got
[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:13.520]  and it's like
[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:17.520]  it's amazing
[02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:19.520]  I was talking to a gentleman
[02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:21.520]  in Japan
[02:54:21.520 --> 02:54:23.520]  and he said yeah
[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:25.520]  you're on Japanese TV dude
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:27.520]  what do you mean he goes
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:29.520]  they got local stations and every day
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:31.520]  my wife tunes in and for 30 minutes
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:33.520]  at least here and there they have clips of you
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:35.520]  on local community Japanese TV
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:37.520]  the word went out, those congressional
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:39.520]  hearings then saying they want to shut us down
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:41.520]  and the world went
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:43.520]  well what's Alex Jones talking about
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:45.520]  and I mean from Japan
[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:47.520]  to Russia
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:49.520]  to Africa
[02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:51.520]  to Canada
[02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:53.520]  to student channels
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:55.520]  I mean everybody is putting clips of our reporters
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:57.520]  and our guest and it's whatever you want to take
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:59.520]  like Congressman Gates earlier
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:01.520]  it's whatever you want
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:03.520]  it's already all free to air
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:05.520]  I can sell on radio stations it's not
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:07.520]  because of GCN that's fine
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:09.520]  I get it they got to fund themselves but clips of my show
[02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:11.520]  I get these calls constantly saying
[02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:13.520]  I'm a radio station
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:15.520]  I'd like to air clips of your show
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:17.520]  it's free to air
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:19.520]  do it but they're all like
[02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:21.520]  conservatives are so like this they're like
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:23.520]  well can I put inforores on the side of my barn
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:25.520]  you better
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:27.520]  or create your own website and do it
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:29.520]  we're in a war
[02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:31.520]  they're trying to shut down our speech
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:33.520]  don't wait for orders from headquarters
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:35.520]  go to the sound of the guns
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:37.520]  it's the very same thing
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:39.520]  I'm like
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:41.520]  sitting there with these stations
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:43.520]  calling going can we just download your show
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:45.520]  and air it off
[02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:47.520]  prisonplanet.tv or whatever
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:49.520]  and I'm like yes yes yes yes
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:51.520]  I don't even need to say yes
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:53.520]  but I get the stations and lawyers wanting
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:55.520]  take it take it
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:57.520]  take it take it take it
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:55:59.520]  I'm not going to sit here and have them shut
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:01.520]  because here's the deal
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:03.520]  stations know we had 86 million viewers
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:05.520]  election week and believe me
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:07.520]  Google and all of them took notice of that
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:09.520]  86 million so they've suppressed
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:11.520]  us down to 35 40 million a week
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:13.520]  blocking us right now
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:15.520]  if you can call that blocking
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:17.520]  but
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:19.520]  it doesn't matter because it just went
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:21.520]  like cut one head off
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:23.520]  five more grow
[02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:25.520]  and so it's an exciting time
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:27.520]  I'm going to shut up now I promise I'm going to Mark
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:29.520]  I'm going to Chris I'm going to Tim I'm going to Sam
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:31.520]  but I walk back there in the affiliate
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:33.520]  relations area and I was looking at these emails
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:35.520]  these calls and these people and I remembered
[02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:37.520]  some of the station owners years ago were like
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:39.520]  can you get on the satellite was the reason I did it
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:41.520]  they're now ready
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:43.520]  but I'm just going to say this
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:45.520]  when I blow the bugle
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:47.520]  that we're about to do a charge the enemy
[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:49.520]  is shooting at me big time and I'm not bitching
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:51.520]  if they get me I'm already I'm just saying
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:53.520]  you cannot fund
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:55.520]  and you cannot support
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:56:57.520]  and you cannot pray and I say this humbly because
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:59.520]  it's it's it's actually shameful
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:01.520]  and I'm
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:03.520]  one of the best things we got this operation but it
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:05.520]  didn't matter I was willing to do it so we're
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:07.520]  here and we are massively expanding
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:09.520]  we've hired like 20 new people last few months
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:11.520]  and we're radically sparing
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:13.520]  we got huge studios going in contracts
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:15.520]  everything and I'm just 110
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:17.520]  percent ready down the road
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:19.520]  about getting bad situation I'll sell my house
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:21.520]  I've even talked about daddy about our family
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:23.520]  land east Texas I said dad we getting
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:25.520]  deep crap need to sell off our ranch
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:27.520]  and then that oil and gas which I never used
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:29.520]  to fund this is not my money he said I'm
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:31.520]  absolutely behind you so I want George
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:33.520]  so everybody else to know you're not the only
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:35.520]  pieces of crap with money I don't got what you
[02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:37.520]  got but every dollar I got like a million
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:39.520]  years so you want to fight you Nazi collaborators

[03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:25.520]  in this fight they sit on the sidelines
[03:00:25.520 --> 03:00:27.520]  they're going to win that may
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:29.520]  work while this country got taken over and run
[03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:31.520]  into the ground we're down to the wire now
[03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:33.520]  you're going to lose everything you got culturally
[03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:35.520]  financially
[03:00:35.520 --> 03:00:37.520]  spiritually if you're not all in on this fight
[03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:39.520]  right now
[03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:41.520]  and i think a lot of people get that i think
[03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:43.520]  we see that that's why we're winning
[03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:45.520]  but the enemy is now getting off the bench
[03:00:45.520 --> 03:00:47.520]  they're getting off the couch they're getting
[03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:49.520]  off the couch the fight's on
[03:00:49.520 --> 03:00:51.520]  so let's not think about who's winning let's
[03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:53.520]  think about who's fighting
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:55.520]  a lot of people get in the fight with you they punch
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:00:57.520]  you in the head and they wait to see what it does
[03:00:57.520 --> 03:00:59.520]  by then you punch them four or five times they're on
[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:01.520]  the ground and that's what the attitude we
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:03.520]  got to have is just attack attack attack
[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:05.520]  and don't even respond to their garbage
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:07.520]  okay mark an organ you're a trooper
[03:01:07.520 --> 03:01:09.520]  and then we've got

[03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:19.520]  alex um i do have
[03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:21.520]  a short comment about what they may have
[03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:23.520]  left in their arsenal uh to use against
[03:01:23.520 --> 03:01:25.520]  uh the people i think that's the most
[03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:27.520]  important comment out there you know they're not
[03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:29.520]  giving up because they're they're slaves to
[03:01:29.520 --> 03:01:31.520]  evil they will keep attacking until they're
[03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:33.520]  six feet under well they've got everything
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:35.520]  to lose and nothing to gain at this point
[03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:37.520]  outside of being able
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:39.520]  to take the momentum back and the momentum
[03:01:39.520 --> 03:01:41.520]  momentum is since the
[03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:43.520]  election of donald trump and even before
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:45.520]  in his campaign it was
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:47.520]  the genesis of the momentum he's provided
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:49.520]  similar to the momentum that
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:51.520]  you provided uh through
[03:01:51.520 --> 03:01:53.520]  the last 20 years or so
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:55.520]  uh when i look at this world
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:01:57.520]  and the people in this world
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:01:59.520]  i know that god
[03:01:59.520 --> 03:02:01.520]  made only two
[03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:03.520]  gentlemen that could
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:05.520]  actually provide
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:07.520]  the momentum turn and
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:09.520]  we had as a country and as a world
[03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:11.520]  our neck was in the news and
[03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:13.520]  they were ready to pull the switch and
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:15.520]  drop us and it wouldn't
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:17.520]  be any comeback after that
[03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:19.520]  and then god made a move
[03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:21.520]  but you were already there and donald
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:23.520]  trump was already there as yourselves
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:25.520]  and you've actually
[03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:27.520]  just as two individual human beings
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:29.520]  but two very special human beings
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:31.520]  i don't mean to stop you but let me tell you
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:33.520]  something it's you mark you
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:35.520]  are awake you got ridiculed you got
[03:02:35.520 --> 03:02:37.520]  attacked it's all of us together
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:39.520]  well i do understand that elix
[03:02:39.520 --> 03:02:41.520]  but god made you
[03:02:41.520 --> 03:02:43.520]  and donald trump for a purpose and
[03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:45.520]  that purpose has been achieved at this point
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:47.520]  it will continue to be achieved i believe
[03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:49.520]  i don't think they have anything
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:51.520]  left in their arsenal
[03:02:51.520 --> 03:02:53.520]  uh well not bragging but i'll tell
[03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:55.520]  you this the military and congress
[03:02:55.520 --> 03:02:57.520]  they listen every day not for talking
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:02:59.520]  point state this is the only place they hear
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:01.520]  what they already know then they
[03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:03.520]  see mainstream media this is key
[03:03:03.520 --> 03:03:05.520]  attack them and it makes them question
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:07.520]  they already know what i know and 10 times more
[03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:09.520]  they're already doing more important things
[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:11.520]  than we're doing the point is
[03:03:11.520 --> 03:03:13.520]  they're being attacked before there wasn't
[03:03:13.520 --> 03:03:15.520]  somebody to say no you're doing the right thing
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:17.520]  we're giving aid and comfort
[03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:19.520]  to the american revolution
[03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:21.520]  we're there to stop the demoralization
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:23.520]  does that make sense
[03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:25.520]  well it's do it's
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:27.520]  fulfilling god's will it's
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:29.520]  actually turning people back to god
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:31.520]  when you look at the medium long run up
[03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:33.520]  into the future because we become
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:35.520]  more good the good we already have
[03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:37.520]  trump set the pro-life marches he's making
[03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:39.520]  about families and humans valuing
[03:03:39.520 --> 03:03:41.520]  humans valuing families that's how
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:43.520]  you kill it in people's own hearts
[03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:45.520]  exactly and you exactly
[03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:47.520]  and they know trump has had a religious
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:49.520]  he was always a christian but
[03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:51.520]  you know it was it was about
[03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:53.520]  10 years ago i'm talking with no trump that he had
[03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:55.520]  a big religious experience and became a really
[03:03:55.520 --> 03:03:57.520]  hardcore christian and i don't mean to give out
[03:03:57.520 --> 03:03:59.520]  secrets and stuff here but that's what's going on
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:01.520]  that's why they're so upset trump trump
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:03.520]  is a born again christian
[03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:05.520]  and it's the same with you elix like i say
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:07.520]  you're two peas in a pod you're
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:09.520]  highly unusual because of the talent you've
[03:04:09.520 --> 03:04:11.520]  been given by god to actually
[03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:13.520]  have the energy the faith the love for god
[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:15.520]  to actually turn around
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:17.520]  the tide of evil what you've been coming
[03:04:17.520 --> 03:04:19.520]  in in the last 20 years
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:21.520]  especially since 9 11
[03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:23.520]  in a way but you

[03:05:07.520 --> 03:05:09.520]  they also help prevent discomfort from a digestion
[03:05:09.520 --> 03:05:11.520]  caused by fermentation of undigested food particles
[03:05:11.520 --> 03:05:13.520]  in the gut digestive enzyme production
[03:05:13.520 --> 03:05:15.520]  declines as we age carnivore
[03:05:15.520 --> 03:05:17.520]  is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally
[03:05:17.520 --> 03:05:19.520]  present in the body enjoy
[03:05:19.520 --> 03:05:21.520]  the full potential of protein rich foods
[03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:23.520]  again you can eat protein heavy
[03:05:23.520 --> 03:05:25.520]  foods now while minimizing
[03:05:25.520 --> 03:05:27.520]  the later indigestion and discomfort commonly
[03:05:27.520 --> 03:05:29.520]  associated with high meat diets
[03:05:29.520 --> 03:05:31.520]  just one pill with every high protein meal
[03:05:31.520 --> 03:05:33.520]  helps increase the bioavailability
[03:05:33.520 --> 03:05:35.520]  and absorption of amino acids
[03:05:35.520 --> 03:05:37.520]  the building blocks to your muscles
[03:05:37.520 --> 03:05:39.520]  carnivore also contains digestive enzymes
[03:05:39.520 --> 03:05:41.520]  to help digest fats and carbohydrates
[03:05:41.520 --> 03:05:43.520]  so you can fully digest
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:45.520]  all types of meals don't let a meal go to waste
[03:05:45.520 --> 03:05:47.520]  use carnivore by info wars life

[03:06:31.520 --> 03:06:33.520]  he's haunted by something
[03:06:33.520 --> 03:06:35.520]  all right well right back to your phone calls right now
[03:06:35.520 --> 03:06:37.520]  man i tell you you see the economy
[03:06:37.520 --> 03:06:39.520]  turning around everything i mean just every indicator
[03:06:39.520 --> 03:06:41.520]  turning around and that's how you know it's artificial
[03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:43.520]  god they took a
[03:06:43.520 --> 03:06:45.520]  desolate country like china
[03:06:45.520 --> 03:06:47.520]  with
[03:06:47.520 --> 03:06:49.520]  six hundred million souls
[03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:51.520]  turned them into slaves
[03:06:51.520 --> 03:06:53.520]  and built the biggest economy in the world
[03:06:53.520 --> 03:06:55.520]  but the people got nothing
[03:06:55.520 --> 03:06:57.520]  the middle class is not existent there
[03:06:57.520 --> 03:06:59.520]  and trump comes in
[03:06:59.520 --> 03:07:01.520]  and just starts taking
[03:07:01.520 --> 03:07:03.520]  the balls and chains off our legs
[03:07:03.520 --> 03:07:05.520]  we can run this marathon
[03:07:05.520 --> 03:07:07.520]  and suddenly we're out in front again
[03:07:07.520 --> 03:07:09.520]  i just see the demoralization of hollywood
[03:07:09.520 --> 03:07:11.520]  the attack on the family
[03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:13.520]  everything it's so
[03:07:13.520 --> 03:07:15.520]  sick does that mean our families are perfect
[03:07:15.520 --> 03:07:17.520]  no does that mean men are perfect no
[03:07:17.520 --> 03:07:19.520]  does that mean women are perfect no
[03:07:19.520 --> 03:07:21.520]  but we're humans we're together
[03:07:21.520 --> 03:07:23.520]  we've got a huge adventure
[03:07:23.520 --> 03:07:25.520]  in the past and in the present
[03:07:25.520 --> 03:07:27.520]  and that's what it's all about
[03:07:27.520 --> 03:07:29.520]  and then they tell us all
[03:07:29.520 --> 03:07:31.520]  we're all guilty we're all bad
[03:07:31.520 --> 03:07:33.520]  we're all this we're all that
[03:07:33.520 --> 03:07:35.520]  when they're the scum
[03:07:35.520 --> 03:07:37.520]  well it's time for them to start
[03:07:37.520 --> 03:07:39.520]  paying
[03:07:39.520 --> 03:07:41.520]  and you know what these people don't like
[03:07:41.520 --> 03:07:43.520]  it's not being in power
[03:07:43.520 --> 03:07:45.520]  they lust after it
[03:07:45.520 --> 03:07:47.520]  they enjoy it
[03:07:47.520 --> 03:07:49.520]  they love it
[03:07:49.520 --> 03:07:51.520]  and that's our weakness is the average person
[03:07:51.520 --> 03:07:53.520]  that's strong an alpha female and alpha male
[03:07:53.520 --> 03:07:55.520]  just good people
[03:07:57.520 --> 03:07:59.520]  they're not just good alphas
[03:07:59.520 --> 03:08:01.520]  you know whatever there's also
[03:08:01.520 --> 03:08:03.520]  people that are just workers people that are loving
[03:08:03.520 --> 03:08:05.520]  people that are good
[03:08:05.520 --> 03:08:07.520]  some of the strongest souls the bible says
[03:08:07.520 --> 03:08:09.520]  the meek will inherit the earth
[03:08:09.520 --> 03:08:11.520]  they just want to be happy and be nice
[03:08:11.520 --> 03:08:13.520]  they get bullied into submission
[03:08:13.520 --> 03:08:15.520]  to a system believing they're conforming
[03:08:15.520 --> 03:08:17.520]  believing they're doing the right thing
[03:08:17.520 --> 03:08:19.520]  because they're being led by false alphas
[03:08:19.520 --> 03:08:21.520]  because real alphas
[03:08:21.520 --> 03:08:23.520]  have laid down
[03:08:23.520 --> 03:08:25.520]  and let the scum take the field
[03:08:25.520 --> 03:08:27.520]  because there were so many resources
[03:08:27.520 --> 03:08:29.520]  in the modern world because of technology
[03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:31.520]  and whatever
[03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:33.520]  okay let those groups do things
[03:08:33.520 --> 03:08:35.520]  I've got my own life I've got power over them
[03:08:35.520 --> 03:08:37.520]  I'm gonna ignore them
[03:08:37.520 --> 03:08:39.520]  but while you ignored them
[03:08:39.520 --> 03:08:41.520]  they took control of your children
[03:08:41.520 --> 03:08:43.520]  they took control of your life
[03:08:43.520 --> 03:08:45.520]  they crave the power
[03:08:45.520 --> 03:08:47.520]  you must stand against them
[03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:49.520]  alright let me take all your calls
[03:08:49.520 --> 03:08:51.520]  for the next house comes on
[03:08:51.520 --> 03:08:53.520]  Joel Gilbert's got a lot to cover but
[03:08:53.520 --> 03:08:55.520]  Tim in Seattle Tim thanks for holding the forest in Houston
[03:08:55.520 --> 03:08:57.520]  go ahead Tim
[03:08:57.520 --> 03:08:59.520]  hey Alex how's it going
[03:08:59.520 --> 03:09:01.520]  I was just curious you were saying that
[03:09:01.520 --> 03:09:03.520]  what would they do next
[03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:05.520]  they're gonna do whatever
[03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:07.520]  Las Vegas
[03:09:07.520 --> 03:09:09.520]  and everything else
[03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:11.520]  the false flag potentiality
[03:09:11.520 --> 03:09:13.520]  is extremely high right now
[03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:15.520]  and I don't see them not doing anything
[03:09:15.520 --> 03:09:17.520]  so there will be a false flag
[03:09:19.520 --> 03:09:21.520]  no I agree with you
[03:09:21.520 --> 03:09:23.520]  I mean they've had their globalist spokesperson saying
[03:09:23.520 --> 03:09:25.520]  you release this memo
[03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:27.520]  there'll be a massacre and when there is a massacre
[03:09:27.520 --> 03:09:29.520]  they go oh you're such a genius
[03:09:29.520 --> 03:09:31.520]  they don't ask who told you to say that
[03:09:31.520 --> 03:09:33.520]  no I totally agree so let me ask you
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:35.520]  what are they gonna pull false flag wise
[03:09:35.520 --> 03:09:37.520]  a bio attack
[03:09:37.520 --> 03:09:39.520]  I wanted to say also
[03:09:39.520 --> 03:09:41.520]  I think McCabe was covering up all that Las Vegas information
[03:09:41.520 --> 03:09:43.520]  and I'm glad that he's gone
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:45.520]  and also I think that the real reason
[03:09:45.520 --> 03:09:47.520]  that is astute because the FBI
[03:09:47.520 --> 03:09:49.520]  low level not low level but the guys that do the
[03:09:49.520 --> 03:09:51.520]  killing the fighting
[03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:53.520]  the hostage rescue team
[03:09:53.520 --> 03:09:55.520]  the Department of Defense is really the Department of War
[03:09:55.520 --> 03:09:57.520]  I mean the hostage rescue
[03:09:57.520 --> 03:09:59.520]  team told us
[03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:01.520]  I'm not belittling them it's just these names are ridiculous
[03:10:01.520 --> 03:10:03.520]  the guys that went in told us the truth
[03:10:03.520 --> 03:10:05.520]  which has been proven
[03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:07.520]  and you're right McCabe then covered it up from Trump
[03:10:07.520 --> 03:10:09.520]  but Trump already knew and smashed Saudi Arabia
[03:10:09.520 --> 03:10:11.520]  two weeks later go ahead
[03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:15.520]  he's gone
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:17.520]  that's a good point you made
[03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:19.520]  yeah we're living in epic times
[03:10:19.520 --> 03:10:21.520]  and that's just people go
[03:10:21.520 --> 03:10:23.520]  hey we're grilling steaks come over
[03:10:23.520 --> 03:10:25.520]  and watch the UT game and I'm just like
[03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:27.520]  I mean
[03:10:27.520 --> 03:10:29.520]  I'm like in the game for the future of the country
[03:10:29.520 --> 03:10:31.520]  I'm not knocking
[03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:33.520]  your football game but people act like
[03:10:33.520 --> 03:10:35.520]  oh you're being weak Alex
[03:10:35.520 --> 03:10:37.520]  you know enjoy yourself
[03:10:37.520 --> 03:10:39.520]  have some fun I do have fun
[03:10:39.520 --> 03:10:41.520]  doing this I don't want to go watch
[03:10:41.520 --> 03:10:43.520]  a bunch of spoiled rotten college
[03:10:43.520 --> 03:10:45.520]  football players get worshiped
[03:10:45.520 --> 03:10:47.520]  running into each other and stuff I get it
[03:10:47.520 --> 03:10:49.520]  I played football I watched it I like
[03:10:49.520 --> 03:10:51.520]  football my grandfather played football
[03:10:51.520 --> 03:10:53.520]  at UT blah blah blah
[03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:55.520]  you know it doesn't
[03:10:55.520 --> 03:10:57.520]  matter to me the big
[03:10:57.520 --> 03:10:59.520]  epic battle for the future of humanity matters
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:01.520]  they're diverting us with this
[03:11:01.520 --> 03:11:03.520]  Forrest
[03:11:03.520 --> 03:11:05.520]  and Houston you're on the air Forrest
[03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:07.520]  how are you doing today brother
[03:11:07.520 --> 03:11:09.520]  man I tell you I'm
[03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:11.520]  I'm happy to pig in a bunch of
[03:11:11.520 --> 03:11:13.520]  I didn't hear anything I ain't got no volume on my end
[03:11:13.520 --> 03:11:15.520]  well I'm sorry Forrest hear me now
[03:11:17.520 --> 03:11:19.520]  might have some audio problems in there
[03:11:19.520 --> 03:11:21.520]  I ain't got no volume on my end
[03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:23.520]  okay Forrest sorry about that not working
[03:11:23.520 --> 03:11:25.520]  we'll put you on the whole see what's happening
[03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:27.520]  Marcus in Fort Worth Marcus in Fort Worth
[03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:29.520]  what's going on
[03:11:29.520 --> 03:11:31.520]  Alex I got two things
[03:11:31.520 --> 03:11:33.520]  to say
[03:11:33.520 --> 03:11:35.520]  the first thing is
[03:11:35.520 --> 03:11:37.520]  Newler
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:39.520]  and John Kerry
[03:11:39.520 --> 03:11:41.520]  both have the exact same
[03:11:41.520 --> 03:11:43.520]  look
[03:11:43.520 --> 03:11:45.520]  in them that both tells me that they both
[03:11:45.520 --> 03:11:47.520]  rolled around in the feasts they both rolled
[03:11:47.520 --> 03:11:49.520]  around in the year and if you bring
[03:11:49.520 --> 03:11:51.520]  up two pictures of them next to each other
[03:11:51.520 --> 03:11:53.520]  you'll see the look I'm talking about it's this
[03:11:53.520 --> 03:11:55.520]  yeah they both look like Frankenstein
[03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:57.520]  and you're alluding to skull and bones
[03:11:57.520 --> 03:11:59.520]  where they have gay sex and I'm not saying
[03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:01.520]  they're bad people for that and they roll
[03:12:01.520 --> 03:12:03.520]  around and men crap on them and piss on them
[03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:05.520]  and then they get in a coffin and Lucifer
[03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:07.520]  enters their body I mean that's what they
[03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:09.520]  admit that they believe Lucifer
[03:12:09.520 --> 03:12:11.520]  doesn't from anthropologists like pygmies
[03:12:11.520 --> 03:12:13.520]  in Africa you know when they're killing an
[03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:15.520]  elephant they really believe they're eating the soul
[03:12:15.520 --> 03:12:17.520]  of the elephant I don't know but that's what
[03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:19.520]  the Democratic leader and Republican leadership
[03:12:19.520 --> 03:12:21.520]  are
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:23.520]  you're right they both look like Frankenstein
[03:12:23.520 --> 03:12:25.520]  yeah so yeah I just wanted to point
[03:12:25.520 --> 03:12:27.520]  that out because it's a spiritual battle
[03:12:27.520 --> 03:12:29.520]  more than just a physical one two
[03:12:29.520 --> 03:12:31.520]  I've called I've called my congressman
[03:12:31.520 --> 03:12:33.520]  I've called a few not my congressman
[03:12:33.520 --> 03:12:35.520]  because you know I don't really necessarily even know
[03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:37.520]  the district I live in but I just got prompted
[03:12:37.520 --> 03:12:39.520]  to because I was watching info or they're like
[03:12:39.520 --> 03:12:41.520]  you need to call your congressman I was like well how
[03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:43.520]  can that be Google the number call your congressman

[03:20:57.520 --> 03:20:59.520]  we had congressman
[03:20:59.520 --> 03:21:01.520]  Gates on earlier Matt Gates
[03:21:01.520 --> 03:21:03.520]  breaking it down we're going to hear some excerpts
[03:21:03.520 --> 03:21:05.520]  of that in the first hour of the
[03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:07.520]  war room
[03:21:07.520 --> 03:21:09.520]  coming up with Owen Shroyer
[03:21:09.520 --> 03:21:11.520]  they're going to cover the vote to release the memo
[03:21:11.520 --> 03:21:13.520]  then it goes to the president
[03:21:13.520 --> 03:21:15.520]  he may instantly authorize it
[03:21:15.520 --> 03:21:17.520]  right when it passes we don't know
[03:21:17.520 --> 03:21:19.520]  this is the excitement of what's happening
[03:21:19.520 --> 03:21:21.520]  but as I told you last week
[03:21:21.520 --> 03:21:23.520]  the vote will be Monday according to congressional sources
[03:21:23.520 --> 03:21:25.520]  we just had a congressman on about it
[03:21:25.520 --> 03:21:27.520]  media said Jones is fake news
[03:21:27.520 --> 03:21:29.520]  he didn't talk to any congresspeople
[03:21:29.520 --> 03:21:31.520]  yeah sure I didn't
[03:21:31.520 --> 03:21:33.520]  I mean
[03:21:33.520 --> 03:21:35.520]  all we try to do is tell the truth
[03:21:35.520 --> 03:21:37.520]  stuff changes sometimes and we're wrong but
[03:21:37.520 --> 03:21:39.520]  like whatever's going on now
[03:21:39.520 --> 03:21:41.520]  we bust our little booties
[03:21:41.520 --> 03:21:43.520]  to tell you the truth
[03:21:43.520 --> 03:21:45.520]  because we want that
[03:21:45.520 --> 03:21:47.520]  we want that
[03:21:47.520 --> 03:21:49.520]  we're dumbasses according to the globalist
[03:21:49.520 --> 03:21:51.520]  we're chivalrous
[03:21:51.520 --> 03:21:53.520]  they think we're mentally ill
[03:21:53.520 --> 03:21:55.520]  they think Trump's mentally ill for caring about America
[03:21:55.520 --> 03:21:57.520]  and not selling out our industry
[03:21:57.520 --> 03:21:59.520]  but notice one year in office
[03:21:59.520 --> 03:22:01.520]  it's all turning around because it was artificial
[03:22:01.520 --> 03:22:03.520]  we didn't have half the world's wealth
[03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:05.520]  40 years ago and lose it overnight
[03:22:05.520 --> 03:22:07.520]  without a mistake
[03:22:07.520 --> 03:22:09.520]  they sold us out
[03:22:09.520 --> 03:22:11.520]  for us you're making great points
[03:22:11.520 --> 03:22:13.520]  I'm not going to interrupt this time
[03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:15.520]  recap start over tell people what you were saying
[03:22:15.520 --> 03:22:17.520]  I was just saying
[03:22:17.520 --> 03:22:19.520]  I don't want to go after NVPs
[03:22:19.520 --> 03:22:21.520]  I really want to go after HVTs
[03:22:21.520 --> 03:22:23.520]  international monetary manipulating bankers
[03:22:23.520 --> 03:22:25.520]  that use slave labor to oppress our people
[03:22:25.520 --> 03:22:27.520]  and I also want to thank you Alex Jones
[03:22:27.520 --> 03:22:29.520]  thank you for awaking people
[03:22:29.520 --> 03:22:31.520]  from this sociopath, this fake sociopath
[03:22:31.520 --> 03:22:33.520]  and really changing betas
[03:22:33.520 --> 03:22:35.520]  into alpha males
[03:22:35.520 --> 03:22:37.520]  because this is a psychological war
[03:22:37.520 --> 03:22:39.520]  because once we win these mines
[03:22:39.520 --> 03:22:41.520]  we could go after these bankers
[03:22:41.520 --> 03:22:43.520]  and there is no bunker I'm telling you
[03:22:43.520 --> 03:22:45.520]  if they thought the Rothschilds crashing their helicopter
[03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:47.520]  allegedly they thought that was bad
[03:22:47.520 --> 03:22:49.520]  just wait if they don't get arrested
[03:22:49.520 --> 03:22:51.520]  and have God and country
[03:22:51.520 --> 03:22:53.520]  arrest them peacefully
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:55.520]  I am afraid for their health
[03:22:55.520 --> 03:22:57.520]  I'm afraid for all them around
[03:22:57.520 --> 03:22:59.520]  because we are forefathers
[03:22:59.520 --> 03:23:01.520]  did not die in some
[03:23:01.520 --> 03:23:03.520]  boxhole in Korea and Vietnam
[03:23:03.520 --> 03:23:05.520]  to have these oligarchs
[03:23:05.520 --> 03:23:07.520]  all over our ancestors
[03:23:07.520 --> 03:23:09.520]  because our IPs
[03:23:09.520 --> 03:23:11.520]  track them, we know where they go
[03:23:11.520 --> 03:23:13.520]  they think this network
[03:23:13.520 --> 03:23:15.520]  can not be used against them
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:17.520]  they are surely mistaken, we already know
[03:23:17.520 --> 03:23:19.520]  their bunkers, where they live, how they eat
[03:23:19.520 --> 03:23:21.520]  so they better watch themselves
[03:23:21.520 --> 03:23:23.520]  they better pray to God that the court system
[03:23:23.520 --> 03:23:25.520]  finds them guilty and they are safe
[03:23:25.520 --> 03:23:27.520]  behind that iron fortress
[03:23:27.520 --> 03:23:29.520]  because this isn't a game
[03:23:29.520 --> 03:23:31.520]  I agree with you, that's why I actually get guilty
[03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:33.520]  like I hope they push it too far at an animal level
[03:23:33.520 --> 03:23:35.520]  because they are going to get torn to pieces
[03:23:35.520 --> 03:23:37.520]  I don't think they realize
[03:23:37.520 --> 03:23:39.520]  they just thought, here's the thing
[03:23:39.520 --> 03:23:41.520]  we were asleep, they thought we were intimidated
[03:23:41.520 --> 03:23:43.520]  now we are waking up
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:45.520]  they still think
[03:23:45.520 --> 03:23:47.520]  they don't understand that
[03:23:47.520 --> 03:23:49.520]  we just want to fix things nicely
[03:23:49.520 --> 03:23:51.520]  because we don't want to have to peacock around
[03:23:51.520 --> 03:23:53.520]  but they are one millimeter now
[03:23:53.520 --> 03:23:55.520]  from total destruction
[03:23:55.520 --> 03:23:57.520]  we got them bagged and tagged
[03:23:57.520 --> 03:23:59.520]  I mean it's like this
[03:23:59.520 --> 03:24:01.520]  I already got laminated photos on every single
[03:24:01.520 --> 03:24:03.520]  given to all the police station
[03:24:03.520 --> 03:24:05.520]  every 4chan post that was released
[03:24:05.520 --> 03:24:07.520]  of all the HVTs from
[03:24:07.520 --> 03:24:09.520]  the Council on Foreign Relations
[03:24:09.520 --> 03:24:11.520]  the Trilateral Commission, the European Commission
[03:24:11.520 --> 03:24:13.520]  where they have these offshore mega banks
[03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:15.520]  using their little Soros Puppet
[03:24:15.520 --> 03:24:17.520]  they better be very careful
[03:24:17.520 --> 03:24:19.520]  because their bank accounts are cryptic
[03:24:19.520 --> 03:24:21.520]  they will hit zero
[03:24:21.520 --> 03:24:23.520]  and they need to understand
[03:24:23.520 --> 03:24:25.520]  that their power is a manipulation
[03:24:25.520 --> 03:24:27.520]  it's psychosis at this point
[03:24:27.520 --> 03:24:29.520]  and they better be quiet and take their pills
[03:24:29.520 --> 03:24:31.520]  take their little child's sacrifices
[03:24:31.520 --> 03:24:33.520]  and calm it down
[03:24:33.520 --> 03:24:35.520]  that's the thing is
[03:24:35.520 --> 03:24:37.520]  they were offered abstentia
[03:24:37.520 --> 03:24:39.520]  and to be left alone
[03:24:39.520 --> 03:24:41.520]  they didn't go away
[03:24:41.520 --> 03:24:43.520]  they brought the war, they reaped the win
[03:24:43.520 --> 03:24:45.520]  they are about to
[03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:47.520]  absolutely experience the real deal
[03:24:47.520 --> 03:24:49.520]  I appreciate your call God bless you Faris
[03:24:49.520 --> 03:24:51.520]  great points out of Houston
[03:24:51.520 --> 03:24:53.520]  it's an epic time to be alive ladies and gentlemen
[03:24:53.520 --> 03:24:55.520]  and
[03:24:55.520 --> 03:24:57.520]  I just pray to God
[03:24:57.520 --> 03:24:59.520]  they back off but Hillary doesn't
[03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:01.520]  I mean she looks like a dying corpse
[03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:03.520]  and she's on the Grammys
[03:25:03.520 --> 03:25:05.520]  they just
[03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:07.520]  and all these weird little wimps
[03:25:07.520 --> 03:25:09.520]  they can hardly talk dancing around like at some
[03:25:09.520 --> 03:25:11.520]  high school play worshiping
[03:25:11.520 --> 03:25:13.520]  this demon
[03:25:13.520 --> 03:25:15.520]  this lawyer for child molesters
[03:25:15.520 --> 03:25:17.520]  is her specialty
[03:25:17.520 --> 03:25:19.520]  she's a frickin' Wrenfield for child molesters
[03:25:19.520 --> 03:25:21.520]  she's a supplier
[03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:25.520]  and we can't get this off our back
[03:25:27.520 --> 03:25:29.520]  Sam and then Wild
[03:25:29.520 --> 03:25:31.520]  Sam in Oklahoma you're on the air
[03:25:31.520 --> 03:25:33.520]  about the Democrat counterattack
[03:25:33.520 --> 03:25:35.520]  go ahead
[03:25:37.520 --> 03:25:39.520]  alright Sam is gone
[03:25:39.520 --> 03:25:41.520]  let's go to Wild in Wisconsin
[03:25:41.520 --> 03:25:43.520]  Wild in Wisconsin you're on the air
[03:25:43.520 --> 03:25:45.520]  hi Mr. Jones
[03:25:45.520 --> 03:25:47.520]  I was just wondering if you think there's any
[03:25:47.520 --> 03:25:49.520]  pizza related items
[03:25:49.520 --> 03:25:51.520]  in the FISA memo
[03:25:51.520 --> 03:25:53.520]  and if you're hearing the children screaming
[03:25:53.520 --> 03:25:55.520]  you know
[03:25:55.520 --> 03:25:57.520]  I don't think this FISA memo
[03:25:57.520 --> 03:25:59.520]  and all this deals with child trafficking
[03:25:59.520 --> 03:26:01.520]  but that's record level in the media
[03:26:01.520 --> 03:26:03.520]  the Islamists is doing it so that's certainly part of it
[03:26:03.520 --> 03:26:05.520]  but no I don't think there's anything like that
[03:26:05.520 --> 03:26:07.520]  in this new memo
[03:26:07.520 --> 03:26:09.520]  okay do you feel
[03:26:09.520 --> 03:26:11.520]  the child kind of
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:13.520]  see what's going on
[03:26:13.520 --> 03:26:15.520]  well I mean yeah Wild I appreciate your call
[03:26:15.520 --> 03:26:17.520]  of course there's people abusing children
[03:26:17.520 --> 03:26:19.520]  of course that's the spirit of this system
[03:26:19.520 --> 03:26:21.520]  is abusing the innocent
[03:26:21.520 --> 03:26:23.520]  so that's their kind of thing
[03:26:23.520 --> 03:26:25.520]  their underground currency
[03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:27.520]  used to be art, used to be gold, used to be
[03:26:27.520 --> 03:26:29.520]  weapons now the big currency
[03:26:29.520 --> 03:26:31.520]  is children we covered that yesterday
[03:26:31.520 --> 03:26:33.520]  on a Sunday show
[03:26:33.520 --> 03:26:35.520]  last caller I'm going to turn this over to
[03:26:35.520 --> 03:26:37.520]  Joel Gilbert who's wading the wings with huge breaking news
[03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:39.520]  Chris in Chicago you're on the air go ahead
[03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:41.520]  hello Alex
[03:26:41.520 --> 03:26:43.520]  thank you Chris
[03:26:43.520 --> 03:26:45.520]  hey great
[03:26:45.520 --> 03:26:47.520]  the main thing with these
[03:26:47.520 --> 03:26:49.520]  idiot elites and the reason they're losing
[03:26:49.520 --> 03:26:51.520]  is because they ruin everything
[03:26:51.520 --> 03:26:53.520]  you know like it used to be fun to watch the NFL
[03:26:53.520 --> 03:26:55.520]  used to be fun to watch the Grammys
[03:26:55.520 --> 03:26:57.520]  you know a little bit on a little bit of a level
[03:26:57.520 --> 03:26:59.520]  but now you know what I do I spend time with my
[03:26:59.520 --> 03:27:01.520]  kids on Sunday they don't get drunk anymore
[03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:03.520]  fantastic so you know
[03:27:03.520 --> 03:27:05.520]  they did play their hand a little
[03:27:05.520 --> 03:27:07.520]  too soon because
[03:27:07.520 --> 03:27:09.520]  by pissing everybody off they woke them up
[03:27:09.520 --> 03:27:11.520]  also real quick I was
[03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:13.520]  listening to Dr. Corky last night
[03:27:13.520 --> 03:27:15.520]  and about all the stuff on H&N
[03:27:15.520 --> 03:27:17.520]  and how
[03:27:17.520 --> 03:27:19.520]  releasing I mean is that kind of like
[03:27:19.520 --> 03:27:21.520]  the ace in the hole
[03:27:21.520 --> 03:27:23.520]  you know I've been told
[03:27:23.520 --> 03:27:25.520]  by five different Pentagon
[03:27:25.520 --> 03:27:27.520]  sources high level
[03:27:27.520 --> 03:27:29.520]  that that whole H&N thing is real
[03:27:29.520 --> 03:27:31.520]  and that they're basically forecasting what they'd like
[03:27:31.520 --> 03:27:33.520]  to see happen and giving you
[03:27:33.520 --> 03:27:35.520]  information but so that's definitely real
[03:27:35.520 --> 03:27:37.520]  and that's why Corky's been
[03:27:37.520 --> 03:27:39.520]  I'll let you know because the enemy knows
[03:27:39.520 --> 03:27:41.520]  the White House directly asked Corky
[03:27:41.520 --> 03:27:43.520]  to be on the H&N beat a month
[03:27:43.520 --> 03:27:45.520]  ago so
[03:27:45.520 --> 03:27:47.520]  and that's directly from
[03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:49.520]  the White House
[03:27:49.520 --> 03:27:51.520]  Dr. Corky is so smart and then one other
[03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:53.520]  thing I mean what does that say about
[03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:55.520]  about QAnon
[03:27:55.520 --> 03:27:57.520]  whether it's
[03:27:57.520 --> 03:27:59.520]  I mean we're being told by the White House please cover this
[03:27:59.520 --> 03:28:01.520]  so what does that say
[03:28:01.520 --> 03:28:03.520]  it does and you know real quick
[03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:05.520]  whatever happened at first springfire because I'm sure
[03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:07.520]  he would have a lot of insight into

[03:30:55.520 --> 03:30:57.520]  a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:30:57.520 --> 03:30:59.520]  We have found extraordinary new natural
[03:30:59.520 --> 03:31:01.520]  way to help alleviate seasonal
[03:31:01.520 --> 03:31:03.520]  distress symptoms including
[03:31:03.520 --> 03:31:05.520]  promoting clear nasal and sinus
[03:31:05.520 --> 03:31:07.520]  passageways, eye comfort and respiratory
[03:31:07.520 --> 03:31:09.520]  health and normal breathing. This is
[03:31:09.520 --> 03:31:11.520]  pollen blood. In the 1960s
[03:31:11.520 --> 03:31:13.520]  researchers in France noticed that people
[03:31:13.520 --> 03:31:15.520]  who ate certain quail eggs
[03:31:15.520 --> 03:31:17.520]  from specific farms experienced
[03:31:17.520 --> 03:31:19.520]  less seasonal distress symptoms
[03:31:19.520 --> 03:31:21.520]  like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[03:31:21.520 --> 03:31:23.520]  and excessive mucus production.
[03:31:23.520 --> 03:31:25.520]  They began studying the effects
[03:31:25.520 --> 03:31:27.520]  in published trials, in their published
[03:31:27.520 --> 03:31:29.520]  trials. Now we are introducing
[03:31:29.520 --> 03:31:31.520]  the fruit of the research, a fast acting

[03:32:01.520 --> 03:32:03.520]  testosterone and energy levels.
[03:32:03.520 --> 03:32:05.520]  Most men know that
[03:32:05.520 --> 03:32:07.520]  testosterone levels begin to decline
[03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:09.520]  starting around 30
[03:32:09.520 --> 03:32:11.520]  at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:32:11.520 --> 03:32:13.520]  This drop can show
[03:32:13.520 --> 03:32:15.520]  signs such as fatigue,
[03:32:15.520 --> 03:32:17.520]  low energy, low sex drive

[03:34:07.520 --> 03:34:09.520]  Now coming up next segment
[03:34:09.520 --> 03:34:11.520]  writer Jack Cashell,
[03:34:11.520 --> 03:34:13.520]  he wrote
[03:34:13.520 --> 03:34:15.520]  deconstructing Obama, Ron Brown's body
[03:34:15.520 --> 03:34:17.520]  and also silence,
[03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:19.520]  we're going to talk about the steel dossier
[03:34:19.520 --> 03:34:21.520]  that we wrote about last week
[03:34:21.520 --> 03:34:23.520]  where we discovered that it was
[03:34:23.520 --> 03:34:25.520]  written likely by a Russian
[03:34:25.520 --> 03:34:27.520]  and absolutely not by
[03:34:27.520 --> 03:34:29.520]  Christopher Steele.
[03:34:29.520 --> 03:34:31.520]  Now the Democrats love to talk
[03:34:31.520 --> 03:34:33.520]  about interference in our elections.
[03:34:33.520 --> 03:34:35.520]  Elections are the basis
[03:34:35.520 --> 03:34:37.520]  of democracy.
[03:34:37.520 --> 03:34:39.520]  I'm going to argue to you right now that
[03:34:39.520 --> 03:34:41.520]  Barack Obama interfered
[03:34:41.520 --> 03:34:43.520]  in the last three elections.
[03:34:43.520 --> 03:34:45.520]  Let's start by pulling up the photo
[03:34:45.520 --> 03:34:47.520]  of Barack Obama with Lewis Farrakhan.
[03:34:47.520 --> 03:34:49.520]  Nation of Islam leader
[03:34:49.520 --> 03:34:51.520]  Lewis Farrakhan
[03:34:51.520 --> 03:34:53.520]  with Barack Obama this photo was
[03:34:53.520 --> 03:34:55.520]  hidden from the public intentionally.
[03:34:55.520 --> 03:34:57.520]  Now we also have
[03:34:57.520 --> 03:34:59.520]  photos of course with Barack Obama
[03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:01.520]  with terrorist emeritus Bill Ayers
[03:35:01.520 --> 03:35:03.520]  sitting on a board together.
[03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:05.520]  We've got him with Venezuela's
[03:35:05.520 --> 03:35:07.520]  dictator, the communist
[03:35:07.520 --> 03:35:09.520]  Cesar Chavez.
[03:35:09.520 --> 03:35:11.520]  And you'll notice that
[03:35:11.520 --> 03:35:13.520]  Barry is very comfortable with
[03:35:13.520 --> 03:35:15.520]  Farrakhan extremists and they're
[03:35:15.520 --> 03:35:17.520]  very comfortable with him.
[03:35:17.520 --> 03:35:19.520]  And as we found out, it's because
[03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:21.520]  they share values
[03:35:21.520 --> 03:35:23.520]  together. Now
[03:35:23.520 --> 03:35:25.520]  in 2008,
[03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:27.520]  I'll tell you how Barack Obama interfered.
[03:35:27.520 --> 03:35:29.520]  Democracy is
[03:35:29.520 --> 03:35:31.520]  supposed to allow voters to choose between
[03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:33.520]  candidates based on their agenda
[03:35:33.520 --> 03:35:35.520]  and who they are.
[03:35:35.520 --> 03:35:37.520]  Obama intentionally denied a fair
[03:35:37.520 --> 03:35:39.520]  process because he burst on the scene
[03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:41.520]  in 2007, no one knew
[03:35:41.520 --> 03:35:43.520]  he introduced himself as a middle
[03:35:43.520 --> 03:35:45.520]  of the road mainstream politician
[03:35:45.520 --> 03:35:47.520]  when in reality he was
[03:35:47.520 --> 03:35:49.520]  part of the little known world
[03:35:49.520 --> 03:35:51.520]  of American Marxism.
[03:35:51.520 --> 03:35:53.520]  Let's start by looking at a video of Barack
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:55.520]  Obama talking about his father
[03:35:55.520 --> 03:35:57.520]  Barack Obama telling us
[03:35:57.520 --> 03:36:15.520]  who his father is.
[03:36:15.520 --> 03:36:17.520]  Because of his background Obama told us
[03:36:17.520 --> 03:36:19.520]  he would bring us together.
[03:36:19.520 --> 03:36:21.520]  It was a big lie.
[03:36:21.520 --> 03:36:23.520]  As I showed in my 2012 film
[03:36:23.520 --> 03:36:25.520]  Dreams of My Real Father, Obama's
[03:36:25.520 --> 03:36:27.520]  biological father who was his ideological
[03:36:27.520 --> 03:36:29.520]  mentor was in fact
[03:36:29.520 --> 03:36:31.520]  Soviet espionage agent
[03:36:31.520 --> 03:36:33.520]  and Communist Party USA
[03:36:33.520 --> 03:36:35.520]  propagandist Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:36:35.520 --> 03:36:37.520]  Davis had a
[03:36:37.520 --> 03:36:39.520]  600 page FBI file
[03:36:39.520 --> 03:36:41.520]  because the FBI
[03:36:41.520 --> 03:36:43.520]  knew that he was ordered to Hawaii
[03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:45.520]  by the Kremlin in 1948
[03:36:45.520 --> 03:36:47.520]  to organize the labor unions
[03:36:47.520 --> 03:36:49.520]  to strike
[03:36:49.520 --> 03:36:51.520]  against the state with the goal of
[03:36:51.520 --> 03:36:53.520]  expelling US naval forces from
[03:36:53.520 --> 03:36:55.520]  Hawaii. The Russians thought that
[03:36:55.520 --> 03:36:57.520]  the US naval forces were an obstacle
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:36:59.520]  to Soviet expansion in Asia.
[03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:01.520]  So in terms of who he was
[03:37:01.520 --> 03:37:03.520]  Barack Obama was a red diaper baby
[03:37:03.520 --> 03:37:05.520]  the child of a Communist
[03:37:05.520 --> 03:37:07.520]  party USA member. He hid
[03:37:07.520 --> 03:37:09.520]  his background and that would have made
[03:37:09.520 --> 03:37:11.520]  him unelectable just like
[03:37:11.520 --> 03:37:13.520]  the photo of Obama
[03:37:13.520 --> 03:37:15.520]  with Lewis Farrakhan.
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:17.520]  Now what about Obama's agenda?
[03:37:17.520 --> 03:37:19.520]  What were people voting for?
[03:37:19.520 --> 03:37:21.520]  What did he promise people if you voted
[03:37:21.520 --> 03:37:23.520]  for him? Well let's watch this
[03:37:23.520 --> 03:37:25.520]  video about Obama's promises.
[03:37:27.520 --> 03:37:29.520]  You can elect a president who has taught
[03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:31.520]  the Constitution and believes in
[03:37:31.520 --> 03:37:33.520]  the Constitution and will obey
[03:37:33.520 --> 03:37:35.520]  the Constitution. Marriage
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:37.520]  is the alien between a man
[03:37:37.520 --> 03:37:39.520]  and a woman. Today I'm pledging
[03:37:39.520 --> 03:37:41.520]  to cut the deficit by half
[03:37:41.520 --> 03:37:43.520]  no more ignoring the law when it is
[03:37:43.520 --> 03:37:45.520]  inconvenient. No more secrecy
[03:37:45.520 --> 03:37:47.520]  that's a commitment I make to you as president.
[03:37:47.520 --> 03:37:49.520]  So Obama said
[03:37:49.520 --> 03:37:51.520]  he was a constitutional law professor.
[03:37:51.520 --> 03:37:53.520]  He's going to obey the Constitution
[03:37:53.520 --> 03:37:55.520]  cut the deficit in half
[03:37:55.520 --> 03:37:57.520]  marriage between man and a woman and God.
[03:37:57.520 --> 03:37:59.520]  He's a Christian. He'll
[03:37:59.520 --> 03:38:01.520]  support Israel. He'll be very
[03:38:01.520 --> 03:38:03.520]  transparent. A man above
[03:38:03.520 --> 03:38:05.520]  politics. It was all a lie.
[03:38:05.520 --> 03:38:07.520]  Obama had no intention
[03:38:07.520 --> 03:38:09.520]  of doing any of those things.
[03:38:09.520 --> 03:38:11.520]  This was a complete fraud
[03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:13.520]  and this was how
[03:38:13.520 --> 03:38:15.520]  American socialism evolved
[03:38:15.520 --> 03:38:17.520]  in the late 60s
[03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:19.520]  American communism socialism
[03:38:19.520 --> 03:38:21.520]  SDS weather underground
[03:38:21.520 --> 03:38:23.520]  they bombed police stations
[03:38:23.520 --> 03:38:25.520]  bombed the capitol they were calling
[03:38:25.520 --> 03:38:27.520]  for open revolution destroyed
[03:38:27.520 --> 03:38:29.520]  the country replaced the Constitution
[03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:31.520]  with a communist manifesto
[03:38:31.520 --> 03:38:33.520]  this plan was so evil
[03:38:33.520 --> 03:38:35.520]  it actually included putting
[03:38:35.520 --> 03:38:37.520]  25 million Americans
[03:38:37.520 --> 03:38:39.520]  in reeducation camps
[03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:41.520]  this was so frightening and scary
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:43.520]  that it failed
[03:38:43.520 --> 03:38:45.520]  it failed terribly.
[03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:47.520]  Let's take a listen to Larry Grathwall
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:49.520]  who was an informant in the weather underground
[03:38:49.520 --> 03:38:51.520]  telling what their plans were.
[03:38:51.520 --> 03:38:53.520]  I brought up the subject
[03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:55.520]  of what's going to happen after we take over
[03:38:55.520 --> 03:38:57.520]  the government. The reply
[03:38:57.520 --> 03:38:59.520]  was establishing reeducation
[03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:01.520]  centers in the Southwest. I asked
[03:39:01.520 --> 03:39:03.520]  well what is going to happen to those people
[03:39:03.520 --> 03:39:05.520]  that we can't reeducate
[03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:07.520]  that are die hard capitalists
[03:39:07.520 --> 03:39:09.520]  the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[03:39:09.520 --> 03:39:11.520]  I want you to imagine
[03:39:11.520 --> 03:39:13.520]  sitting in a room
[03:39:13.520 --> 03:39:15.520]  with 25 people most of which
[03:39:15.520 --> 03:39:17.520]  have graduate degrees
[03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:19.520]  from Columbia
[03:39:19.520 --> 03:39:21.520]  and hear them figuring out the
[03:39:21.520 --> 03:39:23.520]  logistics for the elimination
[03:39:23.520 --> 03:39:25.520]  of 25 million people and they were
[03:39:25.520 --> 03:39:27.520]  dead serious.
[03:39:27.520 --> 03:39:29.520]  So these same radicals
[03:39:29.520 --> 03:39:31.520]  from the 60s who were calling
[03:39:31.520 --> 03:39:33.520]  for open revolution they came
[03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:35.520]  out of prison and went back to Chicago
[03:39:35.520 --> 03:39:37.520]  in the early 80s and they taught
[03:39:37.520 --> 03:39:39.520]  the new generation of young radicals
[03:39:39.520 --> 03:39:41.520]  like Barack Obama that
[03:39:41.520 --> 03:39:43.520]  overthrowing the government from the outside
[03:39:43.520 --> 03:39:45.520]  is impossible. They said to them
[03:39:45.520 --> 03:39:47.520]  here's the lesson, keep your Marxism
[03:39:47.520 --> 03:39:49.520]  to yourself. Don't tell people
[03:39:49.520 --> 03:39:51.520]  about your socialism. Just say
[03:39:51.520 --> 03:39:53.520]  you want to help people, you want to give them
[03:39:53.520 --> 03:39:55.520]  free medical care
[03:39:55.520 --> 03:39:57.520]  and you want to help families. Talk about
[03:39:57.520 --> 03:39:59.520]  change but don't say what the change
[03:39:59.520 --> 03:40:01.520]  is. And this was how American
[03:40:01.520 --> 03:40:03.520]  socialism changed from open calls
[03:40:03.520 --> 03:40:05.520]  for revolution to the self
[03:40:05.520 --> 03:40:07.520]  socialism of today. And this is how
[03:40:07.520 --> 03:40:09.520]  the Democratic Party
[03:40:09.520 --> 03:40:11.520]  into a radical socialist party
[03:40:11.520 --> 03:40:13.520]  25 years later using this
[03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:15.520]  strategy. They now call themselves
[03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:17.520]  of course progressives.
[03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:19.520]  That was 2008
[03:40:19.520 --> 03:40:21.520]  through 2012.
[03:40:21.520 --> 03:40:23.520]  Of course Obama interfered again
[03:40:23.520 --> 03:40:25.520]  in 2012 using the IRS.
[03:40:25.520 --> 03:40:27.520]  Despite the media white
[03:40:27.520 --> 03:40:29.520]  wash by 2010 most people
[03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:31.520]  got it. Obama was the radical
[03:40:31.520 --> 03:40:33.520]  in chief. The agenda he promised
[03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:35.520]  was a complete lie and the
[03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:37.520]  Tea Party movement took over, helped take
[03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:39.520]  over the house. And
[03:40:39.520 --> 03:40:41.520]  Obama was poised to be swept out of
[03:40:41.520 --> 03:40:43.520]  office in 2012.
[03:40:43.520 --> 03:40:45.520]  But of course the IRS was used
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:47.520]  to suppress the
[03:40:47.520 --> 03:40:49.520]  organizing ability of
[03:40:49.520 --> 03:40:51.520]  the Tea Party conservatives
[03:40:51.520 --> 03:40:53.520]  while the left was allowed to organize.
[03:40:53.520 --> 03:40:55.520]  Obama trampled on
[03:40:55.520 --> 03:40:57.520]  the will of the voters and on the Democratic
[03:40:57.520 --> 03:40:59.520]  process with the IRS.
[03:40:59.520 --> 03:41:01.520]  There was no need for a Russian interference
[03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:03.520]  of course in 2012. We had our own
[03:41:03.520 --> 03:41:05.520]  Bolshevik in chief
[03:41:05.520 --> 03:41:07.520]  in the White House.
[03:41:07.520 --> 03:41:09.520]  Again 2016 we're learning every day
[03:41:09.520 --> 03:41:11.520]  that Obama used the FBI
[03:41:11.520 --> 03:41:13.520]  and DOJ
[03:41:13.520 --> 03:41:15.520]  to spy on the Trump campaign.
[03:41:15.520 --> 03:41:17.520]  Now this information
[03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:19.520]  was used to try to manipulate the electorate
[03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:21.520]  and there's the Bolshevik in chief
[03:41:21.520 --> 03:41:23.520]  himself.
[03:41:23.520 --> 03:41:25.520]  In the next segment I'm going to talk to
[03:41:25.520 --> 03:41:27.520]  Jack Cashill.
[03:41:27.520 --> 03:41:29.520]  We looked at the dossier, the steel dossier
[03:41:29.520 --> 03:41:31.520]  just a week ago
[03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:33.520]  and like many people we hadn't read it.
[03:41:33.520 --> 03:41:35.520]  As soon as I read it I called up
[03:41:35.520 --> 03:41:37.520]  Jack and I said listen this thing looks
[03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:39.520]  like it was written by a non
[03:41:39.520 --> 03:41:41.520]  native English speaker.
[03:41:41.520 --> 03:41:43.520]  And what's amazing is
[03:41:43.520 --> 03:41:45.520]  the FBI didn't notice
[03:41:45.520 --> 03:41:47.520]  that. No one in the media noticed that.
[03:41:47.520 --> 03:41:49.520]  There's terrible punctuation errors
[03:41:49.520 --> 03:41:51.520]  misuse of
[03:41:51.520 --> 03:41:53.520]  verbs, misspellings
[03:41:53.520 --> 03:41:55.520]  the sentence structure is a total disaster.
[03:41:55.520 --> 03:41:57.520]  We actually
[03:41:57.520 --> 03:41:59.520]  showed this to a
[03:41:59.520 --> 03:42:01.520]  former KGB officer, Konstantin
[03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:03.520]  Prey Bajinsky, intelligence official
[03:42:03.520 --> 03:42:05.520]  and he said to us
[03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:07.520]  the following. He said
[03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:09.520]  this is not
[03:42:09.520 --> 03:42:11.520]  an intelligence document of any kind.
[03:42:11.520 --> 03:42:13.520]  There are no references. There is no
[03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:15.520]  information whatsoever. It's pure
[03:42:15.520 --> 03:42:17.520]  foolish speculation.
[03:42:17.520 --> 03:42:19.520]  He said I was laughing when I was reading
[03:42:19.520 --> 03:42:21.520]  it. So this is how ridiculous
[03:42:21.520 --> 03:42:23.520]  this document is yet
[03:42:23.520 --> 03:42:25.520]  people in the intelligence community, the
[03:42:25.520 --> 03:42:27.520]  FBI, the FISA courts
[03:42:27.520 --> 03:42:29.520]  did not tell that it was a completely
[03:42:29.520 --> 03:42:31.520]  ridiculous document
[03:42:31.520 --> 03:42:33.520]  and intentionally used it to interfere
[03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:35.520]  in the 2016 election.
[03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:37.520]  So I have Barack Obama interfering in the last
[03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:39.520]  three elections
[03:42:39.520 --> 03:42:41.520]  and in the next segment Jack Cashill
[03:42:41.520 --> 03:42:43.520]  and I are going to get into some more details.
[03:42:43.520 --> 03:42:45.520]  Don't forget again
[03:42:45.520 --> 03:42:47.520]  part of the insult in the Info Wars store
[03:42:47.520 --> 03:42:57.520]  and we'll be right back with Jack Cashill.
[03:43:17.520 --> 03:43:19.520]  The anti-oxidants found in cell force
[03:43:19.520 --> 03:43:21.520]  are some of the most powerful
[03:43:21.520 --> 03:43:23.520]  available on the market.
[03:43:23.520 --> 03:43:25.520]  The stronger the anti-oxidant,
[03:43:25.520 --> 03:43:27.520]  the better its ability to scavenge
[03:43:27.520 --> 03:43:29.520]  for these reactive oxygen species
[03:43:29.520 --> 03:43:31.520]  and other free radicals.
[03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:33.520]  Boost, protect and adapt
[03:43:33.520 --> 03:43:35.520]  with cell force from Info Wars
[03:43:35.520 --> 03:43:37.520]  life. Head to
[03:43:37.520 --> 03:43:39.520]  Info Wars.
[03:43:39.520 --> 03:43:41.520]  The anti-oxidants found in cell force
[03:43:41.520 --> 03:43:43.520]  are some of the most powerful available
[03:43:43.520 --> 03:43:45.520]  on the market. The stronger the
[03:43:45.520 --> 03:43:47.520]  anti-oxidants found in cells
[03:43:47.520 --> 03:43:49.520]  are some of the most powerful available
[03:43:49.520 --> 03:43:51.520]  on the market.
[03:43:51.520 --> 03:43:53.520]  So don't forget.

[03:44:01.520 --> 03:44:03.520]  You know I've got some talking points
[03:44:03.520 --> 03:44:05.520]  here about caveman from InfoWarsLife.com
[03:44:05.520 --> 03:44:07.520]  but instead of going with those talking points
[03:44:07.520 --> 03:44:09.520]  let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:44:09.520 --> 03:44:11.520]  From all the lives, tales and every culture
[03:44:11.520 --> 03:44:13.520]  we know that the bones have the essence,
[03:44:13.520 --> 03:44:19.960]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and
[03:44:19.960 --> 03:44:27.480]  the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:44:27.480 --> 03:44:31.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and
[03:44:31.320 --> 03:44:36.580]  your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this ladies and gentlemen
[03:44:36.580 --> 03:44:42.720]  is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there and it's amazing.

[03:30:31.180 --> 03:47:41.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I am your host for this hour Joel Gilbert.
[03:47:41.840 --> 03:47:47.800]  My guest is the journalist who's written many books of Jack Cashill, Deconstructing Obama,
[03:47:47.800 --> 03:47:54.960]  Ron Brown's Body, Silence, TW 800. We wrote an article last week called, Did Christopher
[03:47:54.960 --> 03:48:00.880]  Steele write his dossier or did a Russian associate? Let me welcome right now Jack Cashill.
[03:48:00.880 --> 03:48:03.240]  How are you?
[03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:12.200]  I feel like I did when I read it, the way I felt when I read Dreams from My Father in
[03:48:12.200 --> 03:48:19.760]  2008, four years after the book had come out in the reissue and when I read that book for
[03:48:19.760 --> 03:48:24.160]  the first time I'm reading through it and I'm thinking I wonder who Obama's ghostwriter
[03:48:24.160 --> 03:48:28.360]  is because I knew Obama's style well enough to know that he didn't write it himself and
[03:48:28.360 --> 03:48:34.000]  I just started Googling around and when I put in Google, when I put in rather Obama ghostwriter,
[03:48:34.000 --> 03:48:39.120]  all I got was unlike John McCain, Obama doesn't need a ghostwriter. Barack Obama is a literary
[03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:42.720]  genius. He doesn't need a ghostwriter. Well, it was transparent to me and I've written
[03:48:42.720 --> 03:48:49.400]  12 books on my own. I've ghostwritten about another 15 that no, this man did have a ghostwriter
[03:48:49.400 --> 03:48:53.760]  and that led me in a couple of months time to Bill Ayers and the rest of that is sort
[03:48:53.760 --> 03:49:01.800]  of history. And with the dossier, same thing, gosh.
[03:49:01.800 --> 03:49:06.440]  So Jack, when I called you and asked you to take a look at the dossier, what was your
[03:49:06.440 --> 03:49:09.120]  first impression when you read through it?
[03:49:09.120 --> 03:49:15.000]  My first impression was to confirm what your suspicion was. This was not written by a fellow
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:20.480]  who was the head of the debates site at Cambridge University and a reporter for the varsity
[03:49:20.480 --> 03:49:24.880]  which was a school newspaper at Cambridge University. These guys are very gifted in
[03:49:24.880 --> 03:49:29.560]  the use of the language. The fellow who wrote this dossier has not to say that Steele didn't
[03:49:29.560 --> 03:49:35.920]  have some editing role on it, but the primary author of this dossier was almost assuredly
[03:49:35.920 --> 03:49:43.640]  not a native English speaker and he was almost most likely someone from like Central Europe
[03:49:43.640 --> 03:49:51.800]  where the Russian language where they don't use articles typically. And so that the absence
[03:49:51.800 --> 03:49:59.760]  of a, us and thus, the sort of random placement of commas, the phrasing, these awkward phrasing
[03:49:59.760 --> 03:50:07.200]  especially on subjects of sex like golden showers, urination show, who says that? And
[03:50:07.200 --> 03:50:15.560]  it was constant throughout the document and it's clear that Cambridge educated native
[03:50:15.560 --> 03:50:19.440]  English speaker did not write this document.
[03:50:19.440 --> 03:50:23.600]  What about Steele's background? I think we included something about his involvement
[03:50:23.600 --> 03:50:25.080]  in far left groups.
[03:50:25.080 --> 03:50:31.000]  Yeah, I don't know about that either and I should have. And he belonged to the anti-nuke
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:38.640]  movement at Cambridge, roughly at the same time that Barack Obama belonged to the anti-nuke
[03:50:38.640 --> 03:50:43.320]  movement at the Columbia University. If you recall, in the early 1980s, this movement
[03:50:43.320 --> 03:50:50.080]  was, this is pure Soviet agitprop. They worked through their front operations in Scandinavia.
[03:50:50.080 --> 03:50:57.040]  They create a worldwide movement to, I mean, movies were made, big rallies were held and
[03:50:57.040 --> 03:51:03.600]  the whole purpose was to disparage President Reagan from planting the missiles in Western
[03:51:03.600 --> 03:51:10.240]  Germany, the anti, the missiles in Western Germany and where the Pershings, I believe.
[03:51:10.240 --> 03:51:15.920]  And Reagan, of course, was stored enough to ignore these massive rallies and movies like
[03:51:15.920 --> 03:51:20.920]  the day after, where the whole world was getting blown up. This whole massive movement was
[03:51:20.920 --> 03:51:29.280]  created as an exercise in Soviet propaganda out of Moscow and participating in it were
[03:51:29.280 --> 03:51:33.520]  guys like Christopher Steele and Barack Obama.
[03:51:33.520 --> 03:51:38.120]  Of course, we've both looked at Obama's article in The Sundial at the same time when he was
[03:51:38.120 --> 03:51:43.640]  at Columbia called Breaking the War Mentality, very similar theme that the United States
[03:51:43.640 --> 03:51:49.520]  is responsible, the war mentality of Reagan of Americans is responsible for the Cold War.
[03:51:49.520 --> 03:51:56.000]  If only they would stop their war mentality, peace would break out.
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:52:01.200]  What about, can you comment also on the fact that in this article we were both pretty shocked
[03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:06.880]  that toward the end, all of a sudden out of nowhere, there were democratic talking points
[03:52:06.880 --> 03:52:07.880]  in the dossier?
[03:52:07.880 --> 03:52:12.520]  Yeah, they just sort of inserted, you're right, Joel, they just sort of appear out of nowhere.
[03:52:12.520 --> 03:52:17.520]  All of a sudden, they're talking about, you know, Trump being, what, unpresidential and
[03:52:17.520 --> 03:52:22.400]  you know, just things that Russians wouldn't even think to say or even think about.
[03:52:22.400 --> 03:52:27.440]  And you know, they didn't sound, they sounded a little much less like Russian intel than
[03:52:27.440 --> 03:52:30.920]  you're right, then they did like democratic talking points.
[03:52:30.920 --> 03:52:35.840]  And then when you finished those from both Hillary and Obama, the talking points that
[03:52:35.840 --> 03:52:41.840]  were in the dossier are Moscow's interference in the elections and Trump's unfitness for
[03:52:41.840 --> 03:52:42.840]  office.
[03:52:42.840 --> 03:52:46.400]  All of a sudden out of nowhere, you've got these talking points.
[03:52:46.400 --> 03:52:50.720]  What was also interesting when we researched it more, of course, was that Cambridge University
[03:52:50.720 --> 03:52:59.120]  was actually not only a place that supplied British intelligence agents, but many KGB agents
[03:52:59.120 --> 03:53:01.120]  studied at Cambridge.
[03:53:01.120 --> 03:53:02.360]  Can you comment on that?
[03:53:02.360 --> 03:53:03.360]  Right.
[03:53:03.360 --> 03:53:04.360]  Yeah, many were doing double duty.
[03:53:04.360 --> 03:53:10.560]  I mean, you had Burgess McLean, Kim Philby, the most notorious of them all, Anthony Blunt.
[03:53:10.560 --> 03:53:15.920]  And these guys created a whole industry in terms of, you know, the guys like John LaCarre,
[03:53:15.920 --> 03:53:21.720]  you know, feasted on them for years because they were, they began to infiltrate British
[03:53:21.720 --> 03:53:25.840]  intelligence right out of, while they were in Cambridge.
[03:53:25.840 --> 03:53:30.480]  And what the Soviets had them do was to stop protesting, don't be obvious how hard left
[03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:31.480]  you are.
[03:53:31.480 --> 03:53:35.360]  Ghost, go soft, go subtle, you know, get into the service.
[03:53:35.360 --> 03:53:41.040]  Kim Philby reached almost the very top of the British intelligence apparatus before
[03:53:41.040 --> 03:53:43.480]  he was finally busted in the early 50s.
[03:53:43.480 --> 03:53:45.840]  Burgess and McLean weren't far behind.
[03:53:45.840 --> 03:53:49.520]  Anthony Blunt was, you know, a confidant of the Queen.
[03:53:49.520 --> 03:53:52.120]  These guys were deeply, deeply embedded.
[03:53:52.120 --> 03:53:58.720]  And what they were doing, of course, was subverting British intelligence, corrupting British intelligence,
[03:53:58.720 --> 03:54:02.880]  and funneling that information back to their puppet masters in the Soviet Union.
[03:54:02.880 --> 03:54:03.960]  I don't doubt.
[03:54:03.960 --> 03:54:06.280]  I won't say I don't doubt, it's a little strong.
[03:54:06.280 --> 03:54:12.160]  I suspect that I would not be surprised if Christopher Steele were part of that same
[03:54:12.160 --> 03:54:15.960]  kind of process.
[03:54:15.960 --> 03:54:16.960]  Okay.
[03:54:16.960 --> 03:54:24.640]  And how, how can you, you know, what do you say when, if you and I can look at this dossier,
[03:54:24.640 --> 03:54:28.000]  which has been online for a year, I don't know why I didn't read it for a year.
[03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:34.440]  But if we can take one look at it and see that there's very serious problems, how could
[03:54:34.440 --> 03:54:42.960]  an FBI agent, intelligence officials, the FISA court, use this document, which Konstantin
[03:54:42.960 --> 03:54:49.560]  Prevodzinski said was complete foolish speculation, not an intelligence document of any kind.
[03:54:49.560 --> 03:54:53.560]  How could the media not have looked at it and come up with these conclusions that we
[03:54:53.560 --> 03:54:54.560]  did?
[03:54:54.560 --> 03:54:58.800]  Are we the only people that, that read this stuff or people intentionally not don't want
[03:54:58.800 --> 03:54:59.800]  to know?
[03:54:59.800 --> 03:55:00.800]  Well, they don't want to know.
[03:55:00.800 --> 03:55:04.400]  I mean, and I reached that same conclusion with the Obama-Ares connection.
[03:55:04.400 --> 03:55:07.800]  When I first, you know, found my way to Bill Ayres, when it became obvious that he was
[03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:13.240]  the muse for the Obama's book, I said, how is it that no one noticed this?
[03:55:13.240 --> 03:55:16.240]  And it's even more obvious with the Steele dossier.
[03:55:16.240 --> 03:55:21.880]  It's like, it's problems, it's chromatic problems, it's syntactic problems, it's language problems,
[03:55:21.880 --> 03:55:22.880]  drop kick you in the teeth.
[03:55:22.880 --> 03:55:25.600]  It's not like they're subtle, you know?
[03:55:25.600 --> 03:55:32.160]  And again, FBI guys aren't skilled linguists, but the people in the media know enough to
[03:55:32.160 --> 03:55:36.920]  know that this was not written by Christopher Steele.
[03:55:36.920 --> 03:55:39.080]  They knew enough to know that.
[03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:46.640]  And yet so much hinged on Steele's, you know, the sort of authenticity in his character
[03:55:46.640 --> 03:55:52.720]  and his legitimacy that they chose not to know any more than they had to know.
[03:55:52.720 --> 03:55:57.160]  And most, you know, most, I didn't even read it, I mean, most people didn't read it.
[03:55:57.160 --> 03:56:01.720]  So they could get away with it, and more or less have, the whole construct is falling
[03:56:01.720 --> 03:56:02.720]  apart now.
[03:56:02.720 --> 03:56:07.360]  But, and there's going to be a lot of unshoveling when this is finished, and it would be fun
[03:56:07.360 --> 03:56:11.120]  to get my shovel in there and help them out.
[03:56:11.120 --> 03:56:18.920]  Right, well, does this dossier speak to the fact that it got through to the FISA court
[03:56:18.920 --> 03:56:24.320]  that Christopher Steele was involved, this left-wing intelligence agent?
[03:56:24.320 --> 03:56:29.740]  Does it speak, do you think, to a larger, wider left-wing, I guess let's quote Hillary
[03:56:29.740 --> 03:56:36.920]  Clinton, a vast left-wing conspiracy to get her into office and prevent Donald Trump and
[03:56:36.920 --> 03:56:40.000]  from being president and crush the will of the American voter?
[03:56:40.000 --> 03:56:41.880]  Yeah, I think you're right, Joel.
[03:56:41.880 --> 03:56:47.200]  I mean, if you look for a logic in the Russian collusion, I mean, let's go back to, you know,
[03:56:47.200 --> 03:56:52.320]  Stockholm, Venzetti, when it started in 1920s, when the Soviet Union realized that they weren't
[03:56:52.320 --> 03:56:56.440]  going to be able to create a workers revolution in the United States, so their role was basically
[03:56:56.440 --> 03:57:01.160]  to undermine the role of the United States and the world, you know, to soften the American
[03:57:01.160 --> 03:57:05.480]  people, to subvert the ideals of the melting pot, etc.
[03:57:05.480 --> 03:57:08.760]  They've been doing that for now for close to a century.
[03:57:08.760 --> 03:57:14.360]  Hillary, if the Soviets, and let's face it, even though the Soviet Union is dead, there
[03:57:14.360 --> 03:57:18.680]  are a lot of old communists running the Soviet Union, people who think the way they always
[03:57:18.680 --> 03:57:26.160]  have and are not apologetic about their past, who would they want as president?
[03:57:26.160 --> 03:57:29.800]  They would want a Barack Obama as president, they'd want a Hillary Clinton as president,
[03:57:29.800 --> 03:57:34.280]  they'd want someone who'd roll over, who'd push the restart button, you know.
[03:57:34.280 --> 03:57:35.280]  Okay.
[03:57:35.280 --> 03:57:37.120]  All right, Jack, thank you so much.
[03:57:37.120 --> 03:57:38.120]  It's been really enlightening.
[03:57:38.120 --> 03:57:39.120]  We're going to sign off.
[03:57:39.120 --> 03:57:48.440]  There's info worth, stay tuned for the war room.
[03:57:48.440 --> 03:57:53.400]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:57:53.400 --> 03:57:58.200]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[03:57:58.200 --> 03:58:03.880]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[03:58:03.880 --> 03:58:09.680]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[03:58:09.680 --> 03:58:10.960]  spreading disease around.
[03:58:10.960 --> 03:58:13.560]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:58:13.560 --> 03:58:14.560]  These are all parasites.
[03:58:14.560 --> 03:58:17.280]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said, there's so many things that are in it.
[03:58:17.280 --> 03:58:18.520]  You have the neem in there.
[03:58:18.520 --> 03:58:21.600]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:58:21.600 --> 03:58:24.960]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:58:24.960 --> 03:58:28.080]  All right, well, I'm glad we got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:58:28.080 --> 03:58:32.080]  It just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose

[03:58:59.480 --> 03:59:01.080]  at infowarsore.com.
[03:59:01.080 --> 03:59:04.920]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[03:59:04.920 --> 03:59:09.000]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[03:59:09.000 --> 03:59:14.240]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:59:14.240 --> 03:59:18.440]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the
[03:59:18.440 --> 03:59:20.080]  products that you need each month.
[03:59:20.080 --> 03:59:24.680]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and
[03:59:24.680 --> 03:59:27.840]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:59:27.840 --> 03:59:33.120]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[03:59:33.120 --> 03:59:34.120]  this is a sure win.
[03:59:34.120 --> 03:59:40.480]  10% off on auto ship, win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[03:59:40.480 --> 03:59:47.640]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[03:59:47.640 --> 04:00:00.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
