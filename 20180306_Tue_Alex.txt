[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your fill-in host for today, Mike Adams, the health ranger here in Austin, Texas,
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  joining the War for Liberty, standing up for your right to speak your mind.
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  Today's show is a special on censorship, tyranny, on parade, and thank you for joining us. Alex is out today,
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  but of course he'll be back soon. We've got so much to cover today. This segment, of course, isn't carried by all affiliates,
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.000]  so the real big bombshell headlines begin after the coming break, but let me tell you what's coming up today.
[01:00.000 --> 01:08.000]  We've got a teaser announcement of a new uncensored video community that's being announced.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  We've got a list of 10 things that you can do right now to help fight tyranny and censorship being pushed by leftist tech companies
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  like YouTube, Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and others.
[01:18.000 --> 01:28.000]  We've also got a report today in the third hour, shocking finding about how aborted babies are literally being flushed down city sewers,
[01:28.000 --> 01:36.000]  turned into bio sludge, and put back on our food crops as fertilizer. That's not hyperbole. It's not an exaggeration.
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  It is a 100% true shocking story. We'll be bringing you that.
[01:40.000 --> 01:49.000]  And much more, we've got Jim Hof coming up from the Gateway Pundit. He's coming up in the second hour in an interview with Jim about censorship and tyranny.
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  And I'll be taking your listener calls today, so feel free to call in. We're going to line up the phone lines and take a lot of calls from you.
[01:55.000 --> 02:04.000]  I'm going to love to hear from you. It has been four, almost five years since I last hosted this show, and I think probably you're wondering why.
[02:04.000 --> 02:11.000]  I remember when I last hosted in 2013, a lot of people said, hey, where did the health ranger go? How come he's not filling in anymore?
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.000]  And I'm back. I got to say, for the last few years, I focused on different things. I built a laboratory, a science lab.
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  It's a world-class scientific analysis laboratory using mass spec instruments and so on.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  I learned how to fly airplanes. I did a lot of interesting things.
[02:29.000 --> 02:38.000]  But coming back now, four years later, just seeing the InfoWars operation, it is so much larger. It is so professional.
[02:38.000 --> 02:45.000]  The people here are on task. They are super dedicated to this job. It's really impressive to me.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  I mean, this, Alex has built, I mean, not alone. I mean, with your help and other people's input.
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  But Alex has built a world-class news organization here that I believe as we move into the collapse of the mainstream media
[02:59.000 --> 03:07.000]  and the complete discrediting of CNN, which is now using gangs' style tactics to try to shut down InfoWars,
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  I see InfoWars as being the replacement, the truth media for America, so to speak.
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  And I say this as an independent observer, you know, an outside person coming in to guest host.
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  And I'm not part of the InfoWars operation, but I believe in the mission of liberty
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  and I see this operation as something incredibly powerful for America.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  And it's no wonder CNN is trying to shut down InfoWars that all of these operations are committing, you know,
[03:34.000 --> 03:41.000]  economic sabotage to try to make sure that InfoWars doesn't make any money, and yet you are standing up as the resistance.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  You're supporting the InfoWars store. You're giving InfoWars a revenue stream.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  You're making sure they've got the money to fight back and fight for your liberties and fight for your right to speak
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  and fighting against the lies of the mainstream media.
[03:53.000 --> 04:02.000]  You know, this is teleprompter-free, genuine, authentic, pro-liberty, pro-America broadcast central right here.
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  That's what this is. And that's why I'm excited to be here today.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  And that's why I want to take your calls because I want to hear from you. I'm excited to be back.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  I thank Alex for inviting me back to be part of this.
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  I knew I couldn't stay away forever. You know, the fight for liberty needs all of us, all of our voices.
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  And I'm being targeted now, too. I was censored on Saturday. YouTube shut down my entire account.
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.000]  Terminated my whole account. It was called The Health Ranger. Terminated on Tuesday, on Saturday.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  And here we are trying to fight for liberty in free speech, but we're being attacked at every angle.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  So when we come back, the bombshells really begin. Stay tuned.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show. Mike Adams, filling in today.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  Feel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[05:12.000 --> 05:17.000]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[05:27.000 --> 05:35.000]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[05:35.000 --> 05:43.000]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[05:43.000 --> 05:50.000]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  Don't let a meal go to waste. Use carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[05:54.000 --> 06:01.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now. That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:01.000 --> 06:07.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:12.000 --> 06:19.000]  I'm going to try to be as calm as I can on this Tuesday broadcast. This is Alex Jones reporting from the road.
[06:19.000 --> 06:25.000]  Mike Adams of Natural News is about to be hosting the transmission here in just a few minutes.
[06:25.000 --> 06:36.000]  I need to address several giant deceptions by mainstream media, by corporate dinosaur-pressitude media, because they're pointed directly at we the people.
[06:36.000 --> 06:45.000]  These attacks on InfoWars, in their own words, are precedent-setting cases to shut down the free Internet as we know it.
[06:45.000 --> 06:53.000]  Now, let me just briefly recap what's happened in the last two weeks.
[06:53.000 --> 07:03.000]  Two false CEOC complaints were filed against me. The lawyer on the case is Hillary Lottemar Clinton's personal lawyer.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  You cannot make this up, and they are completely fraudulent in fact.
[07:08.000 --> 07:18.000]  On top of that, there have been eight Democratic Party-financed lawsuits against me in InfoWars in the last year.
[07:18.000 --> 07:30.000]  A new lawsuit was filed yesterday by the man that claims he has the trademark for Pepe the Frog, claiming I infringed on it when we don't even use the frog as a symbol or promote it.
[07:30.000 --> 07:47.000]  But we did sell an art poster that a listener made titled Make America Great Again that had a bunch of images of symbols that were popular during the campaign that are part of popular culture and completely protected by fair use.
[07:47.000 --> 08:04.000]  It's like saying you can't paint a picture of John Wayne, or you can't paint a picture of Abraham Lincoln, or you can't paint a picture of Axel Rhodes, of the rock band guns and roses, or you can't paint a picture of Donald Trump.
[08:04.000 --> 08:16.000]  So it's a frivolous lawsuit. But that just gives you an idea, the level of this where it was a lawsuit every month, now it's a lawsuit every week, and they're all frivolous and they all get thrown out of court.
[08:16.000 --> 08:28.000]  But it takes hundreds of thousands of dollars to get that done each time, and the Democrats admit that their plan is to shut us down with lawsuits.
[08:28.000 --> 08:38.000]  And they're doing this to a lot of other prominent conservatives, a lot of other prominent libertarians. They're sending a message that if you stand up and you tell the truth, we're going to shut you down.
[08:38.000 --> 08:50.000]  So, nine lawsuits, fake EOC filings, which will become a lawsuit if it goes to the next level, so that's ten lawsuits, excuse me, correction.
[08:50.000 --> 08:59.000]  Ten lawsuits since Trump was elected. But notice, now it's one every week. It took a year to do eight, now it's one every week.
[08:59.000 --> 09:10.000]  This is the strategy. It's the Democratic Party and their cohorts. There is no morals. There is no decency. There is no honor.
[09:10.000 --> 09:17.000]  There is just do whatever they want. Just like the Nazis said, everybody, they were attacking were subhuman.
[09:17.000 --> 09:24.000]  And so they had a right to be vicious and hateful and evil, and not play by any rules. It's the same thing with the Democrats.
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  They have all said that we are Nazis, so now they can act like Nazis.
[09:29.000 --> 09:42.000]  Now, the reason I raised this is I haven't taken off a family vacation close to a year, and I'm just taking a few days off of my children, and I'm responding to this, and I'm getting hundreds of phone calls from the press,
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  hundreds of emails are coming into the office. We can't even keep track of it all.
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  And in the midst of all of this, here's the biggest fraud of them all.
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000]  You have the lawsuits, you have the fake EOC stuff, you have all the rest of stuff going on.
[09:58.000 --> 10:06.000]  Oh, you have CNN organizing, trying to block the publishing of my book with Neil Strauss, The War for the Future.
[10:06.000 --> 10:17.000]  Don't forget that a month ago. Then you have CNN two weeks ago running the operation saying that they're contacting you two trying to get it shut down.
[10:17.000 --> 10:25.000]  Now you have CNN running a week-long campaign to have our sponsors pulled, but because they've already demonetized us on YouTube and taken our sponsors,
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  we went and looked at the account over the weekend. We're going to do a story on this.
[10:29.000 --> 10:40.000]  Big advertisers like the UN and Nike, they went and bought $20 to $160, depending on the buy. That's nothing.
[10:40.000 --> 10:48.000]  On our account through YouTube, through the ad agency at YouTube, so they could pull it and say they pulled support to create this image that I'm losing,
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  to create this consensus that I'm fake news, that I'm a criminal, that I'm bad.
[10:53.000 --> 11:01.000]  So all of this is negative PR ahead of, I believe, criminal charges, or they may try to assassinate me.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  That's what the top experts believe. That's what I believe. Clearly, this is how this program works.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  They demonize you, then they silence you, then they set you up. They imprison you or they kill you.
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  And of course, media matters made a big joke about that, but they know George Soros and Austin collaborator funds them and runs them.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  They know this is serious. They know they're hashtag-hunt Republicans. They know they're trying to kill the president.
[11:21.000 --> 11:27.000]  They know, and when I say that, the Democratic Party, people like Phil Mudd on CNN saying we're going to kill this guy.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  They're trying to bully us into submission. Not that this whole thing is.
[11:31.000 --> 11:39.000]  So people see an example of info wars with all these anti-free speech people piling on, ensuing us, and attacking us, and attacking our sponsors,
[11:39.000 --> 11:47.000]  and attacking us publishing books. People hear this, and then they think, well, I better not stick my head up against globalism.
[11:47.000 --> 11:57.000]  They'll destroy me. Now enter the next lie. From the same folks that gave you the PPgate dossier and promoted it at BuzzFeed,
[11:57.000 --> 12:04.000]  they come out of the weekend and say, Jones made all this up. There were no YouTube strikes, basically.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  He was never going to be shut down. He doesn't have any contacts in YouTube. None of this happened.
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  So you saw weeks of them trying to shut us down. Celebrations all over magazines and publications.
[12:15.000 --> 12:24.000]  Yay, Alex Jones is about to be shut down. And then BuzzFeed comes out with others and says, no, Jones made it up.
[12:24.000 --> 12:35.000]  The Washington Post today says Jones just made the Parkland shooting tragedy a week-long news cycle about him.
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  Isn't that amazing? They lie about what we say about Parkland. They use that to say we should be silenced off the web.
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  Incredible draconian control. They keep putting strikes on us for total.
[12:47.000 --> 12:55.000]  YouTube removes them three separate times and admits people hijacked their systems. That's in Bloomberg and the Verge.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  This is the epic stuff going on. YouTube backs off but leaves one strike on there where we can't live stream on the Alex Jones channel,
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  removes three others. When you've got three strikes, you're looking on your account, that means you're shut down.
[13:07.000 --> 13:14.000]  And they had frozen our account where no uploads could happen. Then they removed it for a third time Saturday night.
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  We started uploading on Sunday. And the Washington Post says, see, he's uploading. He's lying. It never happened.
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  That's how stupid they think you are. That's how dumb they think everybody is.
[13:26.000 --> 13:34.000]  When we've all seen them pile on with everything they've got and when they fail, they then say it never happened
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  because they think you don't have an attention span. Remember, they hinge everything on you having no attention span.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  But we're going to take this audio. We're going to put articles up over every piece of it.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  We're going to show people what I'm talking about step by step of what they've done.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  And then finally, when they do the third strike and do remove us, they say, Jones cried wolf a lot.
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.000]  But finally, for doing bad things, he was banned. Then the precedent is set for everyone.
[14:01.000 --> 14:08.000]  And that's why people took this so serious. They saw thousands of other conservative libertarian, centrist, liberal,
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  veteran sites, gun sites removed in the last week as well.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  There was a huge purge on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and other places.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  And lawsuits filed against the NRA and all this other crap.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  And then they sit there and say, none of this is happening.
[14:22.000 --> 14:29.000]  Think of their disrespect for the truth and their disrespect for you and their disrespect just for free speech
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  because driving after I got off the plane yesterday where I took my children for a short vacation,
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  driving for a few hours to the mountains, all we could get was NPR.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  And I listened to about two hours of it on two different NPR channels.
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  And all they were covering was the left being censored around the world and how NPR is fighting censorship
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  and how in other countries free speech gets suppressed.
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  It was always Latin America or something, never China where it actually counts to cover it.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  China basically runs our country now to a great extent. Trump's trying to change that.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  But it was all about how much they and that fake NPR voice care about free speech
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  when the left aren't the left here. They're a bunch of fascist controllers and a giant gang
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  trying to shut everybody's free speech down.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  So that's what's happening. That's what's going on.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  That's the next level of this whole thing.
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  And because you stood beside us and have prayed for us and spread the articles and videos
[15:22.000 --> 15:28.000]  and shared the links and financially supported us, we're stronger than ever.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  But if we fall, they know everybody else falls and a lot of folks are still banned.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  We're trying to give them attention and stand up for them as well.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  Mike Adams, and he's coming up, his channel's been banned.
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  This is going on, folks, and we've got to get upset and get focused and speak out.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  Alright, back to the live transmission. I want to thank you all for your support.
[15:47.000 --> 16:03.000]  And thank you all for your prayers. If you're watching and listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  I wonder how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[16:41.000 --> 16:49.000]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305, that's 866-295-5305,
[16:49.000 --> 16:58.000]  or order online hbextract.com, heart and body extract 866-295-5305, or hbextract.com.
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[17:03.000 --> 17:09.000]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  See guidelines.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[17:23.000 --> 17:28.000]  Go to libertyoncall.org, that's libertyoncall.org.
[17:28.000 --> 17:35.000]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[17:42.000 --> 17:49.000]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[17:49.000 --> 17:54.000]  Security is a mindset, and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[17:56.000 --> 18:08.000]  FakeTV.com
[18:27.000 --> 18:36.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[18:36.000 --> 18:43.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[18:48.000 --> 18:53.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press.
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.

[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  And we're back. This is the Alex Jones show. Mike Adams, the health ranger of filling in today.
[20:58.000 --> 21:13.000]  For Alex, you just heard him in the last segment with an emergency audio broadcast talking about the extreme attacks on infowars, the extreme censorship, even the economic sabotage that is taking place today against the independent media.
[21:13.000 --> 21:24.000]  Now, one of the key narratives being pushed out there by the legacy media, CNN, Washington Post, and so on, is they're saying that this purge isn't happening.
[21:24.000 --> 21:34.000]  Well, I'm here to tell you, as an independent publisher, a scientist, someone who runs my own operation, National News, it is happening.
[21:34.000 --> 21:41.000]  In fact, on Saturday, my entire YouTube channel called The Health Ranger was terminated.
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  And it is happening across the board. I heard from other people whose accounts were being terminated.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  And YouTube, by the way, they didn't even have the courtesy of giving me three strikes.
[21:49.000 --> 21:58.000]  They went from zero strikes for more than 10 years to two strikes virtually overnight to all of a sudden terminated.
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  So they skipped three strikes. YouTube's new policy, I guess, is two strikes and you're out.
[22:03.000 --> 22:11.000]  And today, here on the Alex Jones show, we're going to have Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit joining us at the top of the next hour.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  He's also been censored and he's written about the censorship.
[22:14.000 --> 22:19.000]  He's compiled the top conservative websites that are being censored.
[22:19.000 --> 22:26.000]  We're also going to be joined briefly in the third hour by Gary Franchi from Next News Network, who's also being censored.
[22:26.000 --> 22:32.000]  The examples of this are all over. They're across the board. The purge is on.
[22:32.000 --> 22:41.000]  And what's crucial to understand about this is that this censorship from these tech giants comes from a place of not strength but weakness.
[22:41.000 --> 22:47.000]  They have to censor these independent voices because they know they are losing the info war.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  In other words, info wars is winning. The truth is winning. People want to be informed.
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  People want to know the truth about what's really happening.
[22:55.000 --> 23:04.000]  And every time the establishment tries to censor voices of reason, voices of logic, they're trying to obliterate the idea that you can even think for yourself.
[23:04.000 --> 23:12.000]  They're trying to obliterate the whole idea that you even have the right to speak if you have a dissenting or maybe an unpopular point of view.
[23:12.000 --> 23:21.000]  But I'm here to tell you that liberty is popular and this censorship is an expression of weakness from those companies that are engaged in this censorship.
[23:21.000 --> 23:28.000]  And here's another piece of irony about all of that, that their censorship actually is a form of bullying.
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.000]  They are bullying the independent media. They are bullying info wars. CNN is bullying info wars.
[23:33.000 --> 23:39.000]  CNN is invoking now gang style tactics today on info wars.com.
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  CNN turns to outright gangsterism to silence Alex Jones.
[23:44.000 --> 23:53.000]  Washington Post just published a story in the last hour talking about how Alex Jones turned the parkland shooting into a week long news cycle about himself.
[23:53.000 --> 23:59.000]  You know what the Washington Post is saying is how dare you complain that you're being targeted for censorship.
[23:59.000 --> 24:06.000]  How dare you complain that CNN is using gangster style tactics to try to commit economic sabotage against you.
[24:06.000 --> 24:11.000]  How dare you speak out. It's like they're standing over you with a baseball bat and saying, oh, you have free speech.
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  Bam, they whack you in the face with a baseball bat. Why aren't you speaking?
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.000]  Wham, you have free speech. Wham, how dare you complain you're being hit with a baseball bat. That's what it's like.
[24:20.000 --> 24:27.000]  And I see this as an outside observer, as an independent publisher, completely separate from the info wars organization.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  You know, I'm not an employee here, but I see what's happening.
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.000]  And it's happening to me and it's happening to others. The purge is on. It's real.
[24:35.000 --> 24:49.000]  And it is an admission of weakness by the legacy media, by the establishment, by the tech giants who know they are going to lose everything if conservative voices and independent voices and pro-liberty voices are allowed to speak out.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  That's what it comes down to because, you know, these tech companies, they are saturated with weakness.
[24:55.000 --> 25:07.000]  They're saturated with these, these snowflake in a left wing, fragile, like neurologically house of cards people who are just they think words are weapons.
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.000]  So they can't stand words that disagree with them. So they have to silence the words.
[25:13.000 --> 25:23.000]  Remember in before the election in 2016, when some students would write Trump in chalk on the sidewalks of student campuses and other students would freak out and they would be traumatized.
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  Trauma, trauma. We saw Trump on the sidewalk, written in chalk.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  It's going to wash off in the next rain. Don't worry, but it's still trauma.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  They had to go get counseling because they think words are weapons.
[25:34.000 --> 25:41.000]  Now these people are serving as the censors and the so-called trusted flaggers inside YouTube and inside, you know, Google and Facebook.
[25:41.000 --> 25:44.000]  And they are triggered by words that they don't agree with.
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  They're triggered by the words that describe what they are. They're triggered by the word snowflake.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  That is a snowflake in trigger. The word snowflake triggers snowflakes.
[25:53.000 --> 26:08.000]  And so they become bullies to try to bully independent channels by claiming that they're bullying while CNN is stalking senior citizens in their own front yards and doxing them on live broadcasts and claiming that Alex Jones is bullying people.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  You know what? Alex Jones didn't stalk old ladies in their front yards and accuse them of being Russian trolls.
[26:13.000 --> 26:20.000]  Okay? Just for the record. It's insane. The stuff that is going on right now is absolutely insane.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  So we're going to play a clip here. You're going to love this clip.
[26:24.000 --> 26:35.000]  This is, as I understand it, Carl Rove appeared on air doing something insane with his nose and mouth.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  I don't know what's going on. Let's play the clip and then we'll respond to it. Go ahead.
[26:38.000 --> 26:45.000]  Similar jump in Dallas, which has one of the three seats that occupied by a Republican carried by Hillary Clinton.
[26:45.000 --> 26:54.000]  Not as big an increase in Fort Worth, Tarrant County. Another big increase in Barrick County, which has the part of the third seat that's occupied by a Republican won by Hillary Clinton.
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  Oh my God. He has liquid coming out of his nostrils.
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  Big red state where I'm coming from today.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  I'm not even kidding.
[27:01.000 --> 27:09.000]  Carl, dude.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  Okay, for those on the radio, they're zooming in.
[27:12.000 --> 27:22.000]  I don't know what Carl Rove is trying to say here, but his nostrils look like a scene out of the original Lord of the Rings orcs scene.
[27:22.000 --> 27:33.000]  I'm sorry. It's just slurping the liquid coming out of his nose. I don't get it. Carl, I hope.
[27:33.000 --> 27:42.000]  Clearly identifying there are some spots in the state that clearly could turn blue.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  Well, that's part of the, I guess, the Republican establishment there.
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  Mr. Slurpee, slurping his own nostril juice. Very sad. I hope that never happens to me.
[27:52.000 --> 28:01.000]  I hope someone would alert me if something were going on with my nostrils here on the Alex Jones show.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  We got to keep a little bit lighthearted here because we are under extreme assault.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  Our liberties are under attack.
[28:07.000 --> 28:12.000]  Everything is at stake. The future of our country, our liberties are right to speak our minds.
[28:12.000 --> 28:19.000]  And just the fact that we ran that clip and that I was able to say, hey, look at this guy, he's doing something crazy.
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  The reason I did that is because it's an expression of free speech.
[28:23.000 --> 28:32.000]  It may not be beautiful. It may not be even polite, but it is part of the conversation of our society.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  We have the right to comment on things. We have the right to ask questions.
[28:35.000 --> 28:41.000]  We have the right to dissent against tyrannical views being pushed by the establishment.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  A lot more yet to come here on the Alex Jones show. Mike Adams filling in for Alex.
[28:45.000 --> 29:12.000]  Stay with us. We'll be back with more interviews and an audio segment from Alex coming right up.

[29:29.000 --> 29:34.000]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you?
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.000]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years. I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[30:16.000 --> 30:24.000]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works and there's no way to quantify how strong this is.
[30:24.000 --> 30:33.000]  But the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[30:33.000 --> 30:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy,
[30:41.000 --> 30:49.000]  this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there and it's amazing.

[33:21.000 --> 33:33.000]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  We're back on the Alex Jones show. Mike Adams here, the health ranger filling in for Alex today.
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.000]  You may recall, last time I hosted this show was the year 2013.
[33:42.000 --> 33:49.000]  Before Trump won the election, before the censorship purge began for all independent media, including myself,
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000]  I was targeted by YouTube on Saturday after I appeared as a guest on the Alex Jones show last week.
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  So don't let anybody tell you that there isn't a purge going on.
[33:58.000 --> 34:05.000]  And later today at the second hour, we're going to be talking to Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit who has also documented the censorship that's going on.
[34:05.000 --> 34:14.000]  The extreme purge that is taking place right now across the independent media got a couple of important concepts to run by you here.
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.000]  First is that why isn't anybody on the left speaking out against the censorship?
[34:19.000 --> 34:25.000]  They are seeing the purge happening. They know that infowars is being economically sabotaged.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  They see infowars under attack. They see natural news. That's my site, under attack.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  They see the Gateway Pundit under attack.
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.000]  They see Breitbart people being banned off of Twitter, for example, or Shadowban on Facebook.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  They see it happening and they love it.
[34:41.000 --> 34:49.000]  This is what's crucial to understand is that the left is not opposed to censorship as long as they push the buttons and control who's censored.
[34:49.000 --> 34:55.000]  In other words, the left hates the First Amendment. The left, of course, also hates the Second Amendment.
[34:55.000 --> 35:02.000]  The left hates the Fourth Amendment. They weaponize the deep state to spy on Trump advisors and Trump officials.
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.000]  If you get down to it, the left hates everything that America was built on.
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.000]  They hate the Constitution. They hate the American flag.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  They hate Christianity. They hate the family.
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  You ever notice that? They hate the word family.
[35:15.000 --> 35:20.000]  They hate, it seems, white people sometimes for some reason, which is totally bizarre.
[35:20.000 --> 35:27.000]  And they definitely hate Alex Jones and they hate this operation, which is why this operation needs your support.
[35:27.000 --> 35:38.000]  Because we are so close to having absolute victory over the fake news, the fabricated media of the left, their false lies, the deep state being exposed, everything.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  Infowars is really the tip of the spear.
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.000]  So I do want to mention, by the way, there are ongoing specials from Operation Paul Revere.
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.000]  Just go to InfowarsStore.com. You will find products that provide a revenue stream for this operation.
[35:53.000 --> 36:01.000]  You're not just getting nutritional supplements. You're funding this Infowar that stands up for your liberty and your free speech.
[36:01.000 --> 36:10.000]  Now, what happens when leftists run society? If they take control, if they succeed in banning the First Amendment and the Second Amendment,
[36:10.000 --> 36:18.000]  and wiping out all conservative voices across YouTube and Facebook, if the left is in charge, they run everything into the ground.
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  They destroy societies. If you go down the spectrum of leftism, you get North Korea.
[36:22.000 --> 36:31.000]  You get thrown in the gulag or executed with an 88mm cannon by Kim Jong-un if you speak out against him.
[36:31.000 --> 36:40.000]  Look at the cities that the left runs. San Francisco has so much human feces now all across the city that's practically a turd world country at this point.
[36:40.000 --> 36:48.000]  It's so bad. They've got needles, heroin needles just strewn about all over the city streets, and this is supposed to be a mecca of leftism.
[36:48.000 --> 36:59.000]  This is Silicon Valley where all these ideas come from, and they've got human feces everywhere that you have to have a map on your phone to know where you shouldn't step on the city streets
[36:59.000 --> 37:05.000]  because it's run by tyrants. It's run by people who despise logic and reason.
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  Look at Los Angeles. 58,000 homeless people now in Los Angeles County.
[37:10.000 --> 37:15.000]  The homeless problem is so bad that it's practically another shadow city there.
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.000]  This is the destitution, the desperation that leftism breeds.
[37:21.000 --> 37:28.000]  Every major city that's run by leftists is either the murder capital of America, or it has a homeless problem that is out of control,
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.000]  or it has a tyranny problem where all business owners are moving out of the city, or it has an unemployment problem, or it has a human feces problem.
[37:35.000 --> 37:44.000]  They want this for the whole nation. And think about this. These school shootings, they all happen, or 98% of them happen in gun-free zones, right?
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  That's where the violence happens because the leftists said, let's have gun-free zones.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  And so the shooters say, well, let's go there because no one's going to shoot back.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  Think about the fact that the left wants to turn the entire country into a gun-free zone.
[37:57.000 --> 38:07.000]  And by that, they mean that the guns are in the hands of just the government officials, the police, that the left says are murdering people.
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  So how do you get that? These contradictions are so out of control.
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  In order to be a leftist, you have to believe two contradictory ideas at the same time, and somehow believe they're both real.
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.000]  Like the idea that police are bad, they say, and murdering people, and they want to kill the police.
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  That's what they're chanting at some of these Black Lives Matter rallies.
[38:27.000 --> 38:34.000]  And then they want to say, well, no, let's give all the guns just to the police and to the federal agents and take the guns away from the citizens.
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  It makes no sense. It's a contradiction.
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.000]  It's like they say Trump is Hitler, and then let's give Trump all the guns.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  What? Your logic makes no sense.
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  It's like they say you got to have diversity and equality.
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  Well, let's see. Diversity means everybody's different.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  Equality means everybody's the same.
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  You can't have diversity and equality at the same time.
[38:59.000 --> 39:06.000]  And by the way, when the left says diversity, what they mean is a group of obedient people all parroting the exact same words,
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  the exact same phrases, but having different skin color in the same room.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  That's it. To them, that's diversity. It's skin deep.
[39:13.000 --> 39:19.000]  You know, someone from a different country, someone, a refugee, and here's an undocumented immigrant, they'll say.
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  And here's an African-American. Here's a white person.
[39:21.000 --> 39:28.000]  But they must all conform to the exact same obedient demands because the left has become a cult.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  It's radical cultism.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  You know what real diversity looks like?
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  It looks like infowars.
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  Real diversity actually is diversity of thought.
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  It's a diversity of opinions. It's the independent media.
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.000]  And it's diversity that's under assault by YouTube because they cannot handle diversity of views, a diversity in the conversation.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  They cannot handle diverse analysis by independent thinkers.
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  They demand absolute conformity.
[39:55.000 --> 40:02.000]  They demand that you conform to their system and do exactly what you're told, or you will be punished.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  You will be economically sabotaged. You will be targeted and named by CNN to be destroyed.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  You will be named by the Washington Post to be destroyed.
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  You will be named by the New York Times, whatever it takes.
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  They will come after you. They will lie about you just like they're lying about Alex and lying about infowars.
[40:18.000 --> 40:25.000]  You know, I haven't been here for almost four years until a couple of weeks ago when I was a guest.
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  I gotta tell you, this is a super professional operation that people here are dedicated.
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  This is the new infrastructure of truth media for America.
[40:34.000 --> 40:43.000]  I'm telling you, when CNN craters, when the fake news media finally loses its last viewer, which seems to be approaching every day,
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  this operation right here is the new truth media for America.
[40:47.000 --> 40:53.000]  I see it. The studios, the technology, the know-how, the wisdom, the personnel here, the dedication to the truth,
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  the dedication to actual diversity of views right here in the infowars studios.
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  The fact that Alex invites me on, he has no idea what I'm going to cover.
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  He doesn't tell me what to cover. He doesn't say you have to cover this and this and this.
[41:06.000 --> 41:14.000]  Alex knows that Liberty-minded people are going to have slightly different views, but they all have the same passion to protect this country.
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  And I want to hear from you, by the way. I'm going to open up the phones in the second hour, okay?
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  And we're going to take some calls. We're going to talk to Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit.
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  We are probably going to talk to Gary Franchi if we can get him on the phone about censorship as well.
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  There are more examples of censorship that are happening.
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  Don't let the mainstream media trick you into thinking that this isn't happening.
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  They're trying to say there is no purge. What? What purge? No one's being silenced.
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.000]  Meanwhile, we're all being silenced. You know, that's why the infowar is so crucial.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  Your involvement is absolutely crucial. We couldn't do it without you.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  All of us, all of it. We're independent operators in this space.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  We are here to fight for your rights.
[41:52.000 --> 41:57.000]  We are the bellwether individuals. When Alex Jones is under attack, or myself, the health range,
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.000]  when I'm under attack, what that means is literally they're coming for you next.
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  They're coming for you next. I can't tell you.
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  Since I was banned on Saturday by YouTube, terminated the whole account.
[42:08.000 --> 42:14.000]  Even my videos of rescuing donkeys and backyard chickens and ice crystals in the winter snow,
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  all of it was just banned, terminated.
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  I had so many people texting me and calling me and saying, you know, Mike,
[42:20.000 --> 42:25.000]  we thought for many years, we thought you were maybe exaggerating this threat about censorship.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  Now we know you're right. You were absolutely right. It is coming.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  They are targeting you. You're one of the thought leaders in this space of liberty,
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  and they want to silence your voice.
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  Meanwhile, YouTube, you can find videos of people shooting each other and setting people on fire.
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.000]  That's okay with YouTube, but if you question the narrative, you will be targeted for termination.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  We'll be back with a special message from Alex Jones.
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Stay with us right after this break.
[43:17.000 --> 43:23.000]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency,
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.000]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage,
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.000]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[43:39.000 --> 43:45.000]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  and other free radicals.
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.000]  Boost, protect, and adapt with cell force from Infowars Life.

[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida. Victor, you're calling? Go ahead.
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.000]  Yes, hi Alex. First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products,
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  they will be ordering all the time.
[45:12.000 --> 45:17.000]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.000]  In particular, silver bullet, as soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick,
[45:21.000 --> 45:28.000]  maybe like a little raffiness in my throat, I drop some silver bullet and I'll still feel a little sick,
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.000]  but it won't last as long. And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.000]  Well, let me just say something, Victor. It's people like you that then fund the whole operation
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.000]  because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  So thank you, but when you mention the silver bullet, colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews,
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.000]  a 98% review. It is our highest reviewed product because it is from the top lab in the country,
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  discounted high quality colloidal silver. It's not a silver bullet,
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.000]  Maximize your potential and take your body back with super male vitality.
[46:05.000 --> 46:11.000]  We're breaking the conditioning and fighting back against the globalist's war on male vitality.
[46:11.000 --> 46:17.000]  Our ultimate non-GMO formula is sourced from powerful organic herbs that have been gathered from around the world
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.000]  and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[46:20.000 --> 46:27.000]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  InfoWarsLife wants to bring you the highest quality products.
[46:31.000 --> 46:37.000]  Our unique combination of ingredients is designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  and creating superior vitality in males.

[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  Boost your vitality and energize your life.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  Take control of your body.

[46:55.000 --> 46:58.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[46:58.000 --> 47:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:19.000 --> 47:33.000]  The American people and the people of the world are witnessing the globalist attempt to shut down free speech,
[47:33.000 --> 47:40.000]  not just in the U.S. but in any other country that still has pockets of basic freedom of expression left.
[47:40.000 --> 47:52.000]  And all I can say is, shame on the so-called leftist intelligentsia in the United States, in Europe, in the U.K., in Australia, New Zealand, Canada,
[47:52.000 --> 48:04.000]  for doing like leftists do in every other country in history since the leftist ideology was founded by the Jacobins in the 1700s in France.
[48:04.000 --> 48:12.000]  And that has set up a total and absolute tyranny over everyone coming into power, claiming they want to bring liberty,
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  but always bringing abject slavery and oppression.
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.000]  Now, that said, we have seen incredible things happen the last month.
[48:22.000 --> 48:30.000]  We've seen CNN try to ban and try to block the publishing of a book on writing and working on Neil Strauss and openly admitting they are.
[48:30.000 --> 48:36.000]  We've seen CNN go after our sponsors, try to have our YouTube channel kicked off, they've been quarterbacking it.
[48:36.000 --> 48:46.000]  We've seen thousands and thousands of articles saying things about enforcers that are true to set the precedent to ban us from the Internet.
[48:46.000 --> 48:52.000]  And we see Apple now moving into communist China saying they're going to adopt their rules of censorship worldwide.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  These are very, very dangerous times.
[48:55.000 --> 49:04.000]  And now we've seen all these fake fraudulent EEOC complaints, we've seen all the fake lawsuits, it goes on and on,
[49:04.000 --> 49:12.000]  with a new crowning one just yesterday filed by the reported creator of Pepe the Frog.
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  This individual has sued Mike Cernovich, he's now suing me.
[49:16.000 --> 49:25.000]  Mike Cernovich created a meme with a frog dancing behind Hillary Clinton in one of the debates.
[49:25.000 --> 49:31.000]  Now, that's total fair use, that's total freedom of speech, it's political speech, it's totally protected.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  He could have had Bugs Bunny dancing around behind him.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  It's free speech, it's political speech.
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  I've talked to the lawyers, I've been in the media 20-something years, I know what's going on.
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.000]  It's not real, but it doesn't matter because then they can just have big press releases with the lawsuits
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.000]  saying Pepe the Frog is not associated with white supremacists like Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.000]  when we're not white supremacists, anybody that knows us knows that.
[49:55.000 --> 50:01.000]  But it's a way to run the headline everywhere and then mention the merchandise of the frog that the individual sells.
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  I mean, does he think Warner Brothers is going to come after him for the dancing frog?
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  They've had since the 50s, hello my baby, hello my darling, hello my ragtime girl.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  Remember that guy, Saturday morning cartoons, the frog?
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  Looks a lot like Pepe to me.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  The point is, oh, Kermit the Frog, did you steal it from Kermit?
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  Reportedly the guy doesn't want Gab using the image of a frog.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  It's incredible.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  But that's what modern leftists do.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  They destroy free speech, they destroy communication, they destroy the free flow of ideas.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  It's what they do.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  So this individual went one further though.
[50:36.000 --> 50:43.000]  He followed the lawsuit on us saying we create and sell a poster with Pepe the Frog on it.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  And what it is, is a bunch of symbols and individuals from the 2016 campaign
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.000]  that an artist that sells his work online created who contacted us and said,
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  do you want to sell some of these?
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  It's been an okay seller, not a big seller.
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  In fact, we weren't planning to reorder it because it's from 2016.
[50:59.000 --> 51:05.000]  So the last ones that we have are available right now at infowarstore.com
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  and I'm going to sign the last 100.
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  And not because this guy's suing me, it's not been that good of a seller.
[51:11.000 --> 51:15.000]  It's not been, I don't want to run it down, but it's, I want to call it a dud
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.000]  but it hadn't been that big a seller.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  I'll leave it at that.
[51:18.000 --> 51:23.000]  So imagine you buy a thousand books from somebody
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  and then somebody else later claims that you violated their trademark
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  because they're saying that somebody plagiarized them
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  and they're saying you're the plagiarer
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  because you're selling somebody else's book.
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.000]  It hasn't even been adjudicated in court that indeed the guy that made these posters
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  violated this other person's trademark
[51:41.000 --> 51:46.000]  because he put an image of a frog in a larger montage, which is totally protected.
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  It hasn't even been proven.
[51:48.000 --> 51:55.000]  So then you go after me and put in the news that we are promoting Pepe as a white supremacist
[51:55.000 --> 51:59.000]  because we're the alt-right when we're the new right, by the way.
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  We put that out two years ago.
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  It's just next level garbage.
[52:03.000 --> 52:07.000]  But see then, folks know if they sue me, they'll get a bunch of PR
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  and they'll get a bunch of coverage and they can put into the PR
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  whatever disinformation and defamation they want.
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.000]  It's a formula.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  We figured this out earlier last year.
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  So here's the thing.
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.000]  I'm not a litigious person, but I have to start suing people
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  that file false complaints or do this.
[52:24.000 --> 52:29.000]  And so when I get back from vacation, these individuals rack themselves up
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  for another group to be put on the list for what we're launching in the next month.
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  And I'm not a litigious person, but we've got to stand up for the free speech.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  We know the formula that's being used for the Democrats and their lawyers
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  and we've got to stand up because they're not going to stop as long as we lay down.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  This is just like authoritarian throughout history.
[52:46.000 --> 52:53.000]  King George, Hitler, the Soviet Union, this is really serious and it's for all the marbles.
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  And so we have to take action, but that takes money, not just to defend but go on the offense.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  But once we've gotten rulings against a couple of these groups,
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  and I've got the lawyers lined up, God, I've got them lined up around the block ready.
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  A lot of top names ready to even go pro bono, but I got to pay for flying people around.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  I got to pay for transcripts.
[53:10.000 --> 53:15.000]  I got to pay for the people that sit there and take the transcript, the court reporters.
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  I mean, there's going to be court costs involved.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  So it won't be in these suits, millions.
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.000]  There's going to be hundreds of thousands per prosecuting this over several years with each case.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  So I'm looking at about a half million to carry out at least two of these suits right now.
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  So please think about InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.000]  And with the biggest sales we've ever had, 30 to 80% extended through this week,
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.000]  but a lot of stuff is selling out.
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.000]  So some of the sales are dropping off as the products sell out,
[53:39.000 --> 53:43.000]  but great supplements, great air filtration, great water filtration, great books, great videos.
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  You name it.
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  And think about Mike Adams who's hosting today.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  Mike has sites as big as InfoWars.
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  He's one of the top health guys in the world.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  His site's from the top five.
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  He's been sued.
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  He's been attacked.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  He had his YouTube channel with nothing but health news on it banned last week.
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  I haven't talked to him in a few days.
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  I don't know if it's been restored, but that happened to thousands of people.
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  That really happened.
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  But right now the Washington Post is running around saying none of that happened,
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  and that we just made it all up.
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  And that we're these great evil geniuses that know how to fool people.
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  And boy, we hoaxed everybody.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  No, we have all the articles.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  We have all the statements.
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.000]  We have it all.
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  We have our sites shut down over and over again.
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  And then they turn them back on and they go, oh, look, they're crying wolf.
[54:24.000 --> 54:25.000]  And this is why they're doing that.
[54:25.000 --> 54:26.000]  Here's the key.
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  We'll go back to Mike Adams.
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.000]  Here's the key because it's tyrannical to shut people's speech down.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  Americans still have instincts and memories of freedom of speech.
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  And it's so villainous that it turns whoever they're censoring into heroes.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  So that's why they want to have their take and eat at two.
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  And they think you have no memory, no attention span.
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.000]  And so they're going to sit there and try to ban everybody and then unban us until you get tired of hearing about it.
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.000]  And then the next time they ban us, everybody just moves along.
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.000]  They're counting on you getting tired and going away so they can steal your birthright and steal your speech.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.000]  We are going on the offense because the best defense is a good offense.
[55:03.000 --> 55:12.000]  It's infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139, but without you we cannot stand against this, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  And so thank you all for your support.
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.000]  We're doing this together.
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  We're going to win, but it's very, very, very, very serious.
[55:18.000 --> 55:24.000]  And again, it's all totally anti-American attacks on free speech to shut down their political opposition,
[55:24.000 --> 55:30.000]  to label us things we aren't Nazis and people that say no kids died and say that we're making fun of people.
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  And just all these lies, they want to delete our channels so we can't even respond.
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  All right, I'm going to stop breaking in here.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  Back to Mike Adams on the live transmission.
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  Please spread the live video links wherever you're watching.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  Tell folks about our local affiliates.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  Support them.
[55:42.000 --> 55:43.000]  Become sponsors.
[55:43.000 --> 55:44.000]  This is an information war.
[55:44.000 --> 55:50.000]  And it takes people giving time and energy, but also spreading articles and videos and financial support to win.
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  But you're all behind us because you understand it's your future just as much as ours.
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.000]  We're in this together.
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.000]  So please, I thank you all and I salute you for what you've done.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.000]  Don't thank me.
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.000]  I'm thanking you because we're all in this together.
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  What's unique about what Alex just described.
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  I mean, this is a playbook that has happened throughout history.
[56:08.000 --> 56:15.000]  The totalitarian takeover attempt of all information sources of taking away people's Second Amendment rights.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  Well, I mean, just firearms in other countries.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  You wouldn't call it Second Amendment in those other nations.
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  But this idea of just taking over countries and installing totalitarian regimes.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  This is the radical left wing, communist, Marxist playbook.
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  But what's different today is that Infowars is here.
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  What's different is that people are willing to stand up and fight back.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  And with your support, that is effective.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  I mean, think about why are they targeting Infowars because Infowars is influential.
[56:45.000 --> 56:54.000]  You know, I was thinking just last night about there are multi-billionaires in Wall Street who don't have anywhere near the influence of Alice Jones.
[56:54.000 --> 56:59.000]  Alice Jones isn't a billionaire, but he's got the reach that is beyond multi-billionaires.
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.000]  But he needs your support in order to win this fight.
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.000]  You know, right now, store sales are the currency of freedom.
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.000]  So definitely go to Infowarsstore.com, definitely support this fight.
[57:11.000 --> 57:19.000]  We are lucky to have someone like Alice Jones standing up with the courage to not be bullied, to not be lied about, to fight back and tell the truth.
[57:19.000 --> 57:24.000]  We are lucky to be part of this epic fight for human history, human civilization.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  Everything is at stake right now.
[57:26.000 --> 57:33.000]  So support this fight, Infowarsstore.com, and just support us by sharing all of our content myself as well.
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  You know, I'm under attack. Alex is under attack. Jim Hoft is under attack.
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  He's coming up in the next hour, by the way. We're all under attack.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  This is real. This is happening.
[57:42.000 --> 57:49.000]  Join the Infowar and free our minds once and for all.
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[57:54.000 --> 58:04.000]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[58:04.000 --> 58:11.000]  And as a longtime Infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex.
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex.
[58:13.000 --> 58:14.000]  Thank you.
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.000]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[58:19.000 --> 58:24.000]  The super blue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the Infowars Life products.
[58:24.000 --> 58:30.000]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[58:30.000 --> 58:31.000]  Absolutely.
[58:31.000 --> 58:39.000]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on.
[58:39.000 --> 58:44.000]  And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from infowarslife.com.
[58:54.000 --> 58:58.000]  But instead of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[58:58.000 --> 59:03.000]  From all the wives, tales and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.000]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.000]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[59:10.000 --> 59:14.000]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is.
[59:14.000 --> 59:23.000]  But the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[59:23.000 --> 59:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy.
[59:31.000 --> 59:38.000]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there.
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  And it's amazing.
[59:40.000 --> 59:44.000]  Find out for yourself today at infowarsstore.com, what it could do for your family.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[59:46.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  And for funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in today.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  We've got an exciting second hour coming up for you.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  We'll be interviewing Jim Hoff from the Gateway Pundit, who has also been targeted with extreme censorship.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  And in this short segment here, I want to bring your attention to the fact that everyone who is associated with infowars is being attacked and bullied
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  and censored.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  And Paul Joseph Watson, of course, is one of those people now being bullied and attacked by CNN,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  which has become the fake news bully network, really.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  Maybe it should be BNN for bully news network.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  But Paul has a really good segment here.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  I want to give you a listen to a couple of minutes of it.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  So go ahead and roll that segment. We'll come back in.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Yours truly has come under attack from CNN.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  They say, wait for it, they say I'm not mainstream.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  I appeared on Breitbart Radio and CNN's senior media reporter responded with this.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  I'm old enough to remember when Breitbart was trying to go mainstream.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  Guess they gave up.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  What exactly is mainstream these days?
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  I mean, I know I come out with some edgy opinions from time to time,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  but I could never compete with CNN as saying something offensive.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  Then there's heaping praise on somebody who represents a brutal dictatorship
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  that incarcerates tortures and executes hundreds of thousands of political dissidents.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  That's pretty edgy.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  Is that what constitutes being mainstream now?
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Genuflecting in front of a despotic regime that starves its own population to death.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  So mainstream.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but last time I checked,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  I don't think infowars or Breitbart were thawning over a country that has no independent media
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  functioning civil society or religious freedom.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  That's CNN's job.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  So mainstream.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  Maybe I'd be more mainstream if I encouraged cock-holdry.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  Apparently that's mainstream now too.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  But you know, when your prime time shows get less viewers
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  than decades-old reruns of yogi bear cartoons,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  I guess you gotta spice it up a bit.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  Nah, I went on to heap praise on one of the world's leading conspiracy theorists
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  describing him as a smart guy and someone who is wildly popular.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  Second half of that, I'm not gonna argue with,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  but calling me one of the world's leading conspiracy theorists.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  Don't know if you've noticed,
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  but in virtually every video I've made about big events for the past three years,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  I've debunked conspiracy theories.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Did I believe in some pretty out-there conspiracy theories?
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  Let's bring it back in 10 seconds.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  Yeah, then I grew up.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  See, there's quite a big difference between my conspiracy theories and those pushed by CNN.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  I didn't help promote the conspiracy theory that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Conspiracy theory that led to hundreds of thousands of dead people.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  That's Paul Joseph Watson there.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  I had to cut it off there because of the time limitations.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  If you see me looking up that way, I'm just looking at the show clock.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  I don't have it all memorized here because I don't do this every day.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  But Paul Joseph Watson makes excellent points there.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  I really recommend that you watch that video at infowars.com.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  And the thing is, they can't stand someone like Paul Joseph Watson,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  or they can't stand someone like me or Jim Hoft who we're going to talk to in just a few minutes here.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  Because, I mean, right there, Paul Joseph Watson, he's being a little satirical.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  He's funny. We all do a little bit of humor on the side.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  But when it comes down to it, we are the ones who have the logic, the reason, the historical facts
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  that can counter the delusional nonsense of the left.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  The left wants you to believe in things that absolutely are not true.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  They want to make sure that things that are true, you think they're conspiracy theories
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  and then they want you to believe falsehoods as if they were facts.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  That's the twisting that they do, and so they cannot have dissenting voices.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  Like Paul Joseph Watson, who is, frankly, he's a YouTube superstar, right?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  I mean, he's got really millions of followers across all social media plus video platforms.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  He's a superstar for pointing out the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the left.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  And that's why info wars is popular.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  Do you realize that info wars, if it were not suppressed, it would be, by far,
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  the largest media organization in America? No joke.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  And it's probably right up there, you know, in the top few right now,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  even with all the censorship that's going on.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  We're going to come back with Jim Hoff from the Gateway Pundit.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  A fascinating interview coming right up.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  This is Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones show.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  Thank you for joining us. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  Mike has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  to work synergistically for full body support.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  Try bodies today at infowarslife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger of naturalnews.com.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  Filling in today, thank you for joining us.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  Just to tell you how popular Infowars is, my phone has been blowing up with text from everybody who knows me
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  who's like, oh, you're hosting the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  Yeah, thanks for watching.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  But it just goes to show you how effective and how popular Infowars has become.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  Now, coming up, we're going to be joined by Jim Hoff from the Gateway Pundit.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  Jim has also been targeted by extreme censorship.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  And he's documented in many of the cases of censorship of conservative websites.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  And he's got a lot to offer.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  We're going to be talking to him shortly.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  But first, some headlines.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  NRA membership is surging now in the wake of the gun control agenda push following the Parkland shooting.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  So once again, it's backfiring.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  People are now recognizing that their guns are...
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  There's an attempt to confiscate your guns.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  That's another thing that the left-wing media says, oh, that's not true.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  It's not real.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  We're not coming for your guns just like they're saying, oh, we're not censoring Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson or the Health Ranger.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  No, it's not even happening.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  Don't pay attention to that.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  Yes, they're coming for your guns.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  That's their ultimate goal.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  They want to take the guns away from citizens because, you know, an individual with a firearm is a citizen, not a slave.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  And they know that too.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  They want you to be a slave.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  North Korea says it's willing to discuss nuclear disarmament now.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  Yeah, really?
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  I think that's fate.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  I think that's just posturing and positioning.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  And I posted this story last night.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  Trans men, transgender men are now on track to eliminate all women from sports because all the women's sports are now being, you know, invaded by trans men who are, of course, physically...
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  They're either on male hormones like testosterone or they grew up as biological men and then they changed, you know, to women.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  They say they're women and now they're beating women on the mats and winning high school championships.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  You're supposed to stand up and cheer, oh, oh, you wonderful trans wrestlers beating women to a pulp on the mat.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  Wow, you are social justice warriors.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  Wow, why can't you fight real men?
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  You know, it's insane.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  But enough of that, if I keep talking about that, I'm going to lose it.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  Joining us now is Jim Hoff from the Gateway Pundit Gym.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  I want to welcome you to the Alice Jones Show.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  Thank you for joining us today.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  Great to be with you, Mike.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  Congratulations on filling in.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  Well, it's an honor and a privilege to be here.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  But I got to tell you, I'm a big fan of your work.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  I've been following your website very closely.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  You're very quick to get news out that is breakthrough news.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  How do you do it, man?
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  Do you work like 16 hours a day?
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  I have a pretty good staff.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  We're pretty limited.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  And I also have some wonderful readers who send me tips.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  So that helps.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  But we do what we can, you know?
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  Now, you've put out an article over the last couple of days that documents some of the big conservative sites and personalities who are being systematically targeted for censorship by the tech giants.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  Can you go over what you found a little bit?
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  I'd be happy to.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  And of course, I have natural news on that list now, which is tragic.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  What happened to you guys?
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  It's criminal.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  This activity that's going on, we know it is.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  In my case and in several people in my situation, we actually advertised with Facebook, sent them tens of thousands of dollars to build our Gateway Pundit webpage on Facebook and to build our fans.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  And now this past weekend, you know, since the election, my Gateway Pundit was very successful during the election.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  Donald Trump win as Info Wars did as we saw Breitbart got huge during the election.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  What happened?
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  What's your name?
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  Is it like the fourth most influential site, a conservative site?
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Right.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  And this was a study.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  It was actually a study done by Harvard, another one done by Columbia Journalism Review, a very respected journalism school.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  They came up with these numbers and found that Gateway Pundit was the fourth most influential news source on the right during the election.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  And what this study told us too was that conservatives, as you know, as the Info Wars audience knows, conservatives, they left the media at the last election.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  They refused to be abused after decades of this, you know, awful reporting and berating by the liberal media.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  And they went to social media.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  They went to sites like yours.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  They went to sites like mine.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  They went to Info Wars to get the real news.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  And so what happened after this election was actually George Soros funded one of those studies I just mentioned.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  Why?
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  They discovered that these social media sites, these websites were the ones leading the charge in helping Trump get elected.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Of course, it wasn't the national media and it wasn't the conservative, traditional conservative media because a lot of them were never Trumpers.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  But it seems like right now, Jim, I'm sorry, Rob, we just lost your video, I guess it's back.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  But you know, the question here is, aren't these tech giants admitting that they are tyrants in now this overt censorship?
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  It used to be shadow banning.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  It used to be covert, like a secret black box algorithm.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Now it's right out in the open.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  They're just banning, terminating entire channels.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  Aren't they admitting now that they are tyrants and that they support tyranny?
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  Absolutely.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  And it's their goal.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  It's their goal is to silence all of us.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  And because they know this is how people are getting their information.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  Conservatives wholeheartedly rejected the national media.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Now they go to sites like ours.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  Our Facebook traffic has been declining ever since these studies came out.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  And our organic traffic continues to go up, but our Facebook traffic continues to decline, which is kind of a weird concept.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  And it's only explained because they're targeting us.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  And then this weekend with the latest algorithmic change, we saw that we were getting about as much traffic as a cakewalk
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  at a country church bazaar.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Yeah.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  So we're talking about 15, 15 hits coming from our 640,000 Facebook fans.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  Here's what's studying.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  I'm sorry to interrupt is a little bit of a delay.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  But if you weren't being effective, they wouldn't be targeting you for banning.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  I mean, think about this.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  The fact that your voice is so influential and so powerful.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  So many people go to the gatewaypundit.com and find useful information.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  They're just like info wars.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  Info wars is influential.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  It, it wakes people up.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  It's not like hypnotizing people.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  It's de hypnotizing people from the lies of the mainstream media.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  Jim, you are a de hypnotist as well.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  Welcome to the de hypnosis club.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  Great.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  Glad to join it.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  And Mike, I got to tell you, since I started talking about this at gatewaypundit and putting up articles and really, you know, I'm freaked out about this.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  I don't think I don't know if your audience, if the Americans really understand how serious this is.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  If they shut us down, that's it.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  It's getting over.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  This is where the fascists win.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  This is where the communists take over.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  And that sounds very conspiracy like and I don't tend to be that way.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  But I really believe that's what we're heading to if they succeed with this.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  And what's interesting too is since I started putting up these stories, I'm getting emails from all of these large conservative pro Trump websites and Facebook pages saying the same things happening to us.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  I had a discussion with one of these Facebook pages this morning.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  I'm not going to mention who they were getting 32 million readers a week during the election.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Now it's down to about one or two million a week.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  Are you?
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  So this is what's happening.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  They're just shutting us down.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  Here's something else that I'm hearing.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  I don't want to ask you if you're hearing the same thing.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  We've got about two minutes left in this segment.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  I want to hold you for the next segment as well.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  But many of these independent smaller media websites are conservative sites.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  I think for a long time, a lot of them thought that Alex Jones was kind of out there when he was warning about the coming tyranny and the coming censorship.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  Well, now it's here.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  I mean, I'm hearing from people things like, oh my God, Alex Jones was right.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  You know, oh my God, all of a sudden it's here.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  You know, he used to sound fringe.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  Now it's actually happening.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  Are you hearing anything like that?
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  Absolutely.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  And, you know, Alex did warn us on he was absolutely correct.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  The sad thing is, Mike, is that where the hell is the Republican politicians?
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  Right.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  I went to Congress and I spoke to some of these people saying, you need to address this because they're going to lose all of their, all of the major media players that support Republican news.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  Well, where is Jeff Sessions too?
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  You know, it's like, what is he doing in the interest of the United States?
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  Jim, we've got about a minute left in this segment.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  I'd like to hold you over to the next segment.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  You're doing amazing work.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  Your website, the Gateway Pundit, is putting out information that every American needs to see.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  And I believe that if you weren't being suppressed and if we weren't being suppressed, we would be the dominant media in America.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  And that's exactly why they're suppressing us.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  Absolutely.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  And I get a joke out of this show on Sunday morning, Fox News, where they call it media buzz.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  It's about all the traditional media, but it doesn't include anybody online and that's where all the eyeballs are for conservatives these days.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  Exactly.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  Sorry to cut you off there.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  We're going to break, folks.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  The interview here is with Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  My name is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  We'll be back with more right after this break.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  Stay with us.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banion Hill.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  You like freedom?
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  I do.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  You like money?
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  I do, too.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  If you like freedom and money, then you're going to love freedom checks.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who stakes their claim.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  Yep, you heard that right, $34.6 billion.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  To get all the details, just go to www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  Thousands of people already lined up to cash in.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  Take Doug, for example.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  He's a 46-year-old from Joplin, Missouri who's set to get a check for $24,075.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  If Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can, too.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  But here's the thing.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  If you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion payout,
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  you must have your ducks in a row by April 1st.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  So don't wait.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  Get over to www.americanfreedomchecks.com before the April 1st deadline.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  That's www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals,
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  And does it all at only $0.02 per gallon.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  Call or click 1-877-99-Berkey or BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  Introducing Fluorolife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  Fluorolife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics,
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion,
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  Fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Fluorolife probiotics today.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  I'm so excited. The new product at InfoWarsLife.com, in a glass bottle,
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it,
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  It is amazing.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, born and domestic.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  All right, we're back on the Alex Jones show. Thank you for joining us today. Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  I have been the subject of extreme censorship, just like Alex and Paul Joseph Watson and many conservative channels,
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  just like Jim Hoff, our guest for this segment. He's with thegatewaypundit.com,
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  and he has been documenting the systematic censorship of conservative websites,
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  many that he has listed on his website, and many that he hasn't been able to name,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  because those publishers are too freaked out, too afraid, let's say, to even allow their names to be mentioned.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  And during the break, Jim was telling me that he is freaked out about what this means for America.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  If they're silencing half the country, half the conversation, what does this mean for the future sustainability of a democracy or a republic?
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  So, Jim, welcome back to the show. I appreciate you joining us today.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  And that's the question. That's the opening question for you. What does this mean for our democracy?
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  Well, our republic, I like to say, if they silence half the voices.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  Yeah, I think it's pretty evident what's going to happen. And I think that the republican lawmakers better wake up,
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  because if when we're gone, when if a war is gone, when natural news is gone,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  when all of these places are gone, who's going to be there to carry the message, you know?
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  Who's going to be there to correct the record when the media puts up this complete bias that they throw up every day
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  and hurl at the American people? There won't be any.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  And so it's unfortunate that we don't have an enlightened political party that would represent us.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  But that isn't the fact today. They're just, I don't understand what they put their attention on.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  I don't understand what they do with their time. I don't understand what their staff is doing all day.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  If they don't see what's happening with the people who are supporting them and that we're being picked off one at a time
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  by these social media giants to silence us and quash our voice forever.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  Well, what would you say, though, some of the people who are defending this censorship, if you can believe that,
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  it's, you know, tyrannical leftists that pretty much all leftists at this point are sort of totalitarians at heart.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  It's just starting to come out now and be expressed.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  But they say that, oh, these are private corporations. They can censor anyone they want.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  What's your response to an accusation like that?
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  Yeah, I love that one line that James Woods, the actor used to, he tweeted this out a few times.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  It was scratch a liberal, find a Marxist. And of course, that's what we have today in America.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  This party on the left stands for nothing except complete control over the population and these failed socialist policies.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  And of course, there are, you know, social agitation that goes on constantly.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  I think I just think what's happening is just, you know, it's going to destroy this country.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  And, you know, another example I wanted to throw in here was today, just before I came in on the air with you,
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  we get this email from Facebook. Now, they shut down our traffic.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  So this is really just rubbing salt in our wounds.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  But what they said was that this article we put up like two weeks ago that went viral.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  They're saying this was fake news and we're going to take this, you know, we're not going to let people read this and we're going to redirect them.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  They're actually, this is what they're doing.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  They're redirecting people from Gateway Pondet and say, go read this article instead by the AP, which is unbelievable.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  So they're taking our story. They're saying it's false.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  And by the way, this was a private letter we got from one of the fathers from Parkland, right?
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  They have no evidence that this is fake news.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  In fact, we protected this father. We looked into his family.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  What he said was absolutely correct.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  And they're telling their audience that the AP says this is not legitimate news and that they should go read the AP article instead.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  They're literally hijacking your traffic and pushing it over to fake news associated press in this case.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  But I guess they could choose somewhere else they want to push it to like CNN.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  Absolutely.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  It's, it's so out of control.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  You know, you also mentioned during the break that there's an upcoming March, you know, the anti-gun or the gun control March.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And you said something that really got my attention that they're recruiting and indoctrinating schoolchildren now as young as nine years old to go out and join this march.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  Is that correct?
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  Right. They're, they're, they're organizing the social justice warriors of tomorrow.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  I got a letter from a parent out in New Jersey with this school district.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  They're sending home letters to the parents saying, sign here if you will allow your little darling, your little nine year old to go march in this, this anti-gun rally next week, which is on the 14th.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  And we know all the leftist radical organizations that are behind this, this march.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  And there's, so they're asking parents to allow their nine year olds to participate in this social justice warrior, you know, event that's happening across the country next week.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  It's unbelievable.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  The indoctrination.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  I mean, that, that honestly reminds me of like Hitler youth indoctrination.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  It's fascist.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  It is, it's out of control.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  And, you know, I got a bigger, just a hint of a warning there.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  And I'm saying this, not you, I don't want this to come back on you.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  But, you know, if someone wanted to pull off a false flag shooting to really try to take away the guns, if they had children at the march and then they actually carried out a shooting of those children.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  And they always use children, you know, to invoke emotion and get a reaction.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  It's like they're setting up a perfect storm for a false flag event.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  I mean, I hope it never happens.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  I'm not, I'm not predicting it as it's going to happen.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  I'm just saying if, if they wanted to, it's like a perfect situation for them to murder those children to take our guns.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  It's sick.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  I know, I know it's like, do they even do this?
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  Yeah, they're sick at this point.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  They will do anything to take our liberty.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  Yeah, I wouldn't put it past them.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  I mean, we saw the reaction in Parkland where they ignored this guy on social media, even though he was using his own name.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  They lied about it then saying that they tried to look him up, which they didn't because his name was right there.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  He was also, he used his real name on Instagram too, as we reported at Gateway Puddin.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  So there was no investigation of this guy when he's throwing these threats out there.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  No investigation of the 40 calls to his house.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  They didn't link anything.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  The school did tell this kid not to bring a backpack to school.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  That's how scared they were of this nutcase.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  And, and then they tell the cops to wait outside, you know, the deputies to wait outside as children are getting shot inside.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  What the hell was that?
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  And now they want to take our guns because of these missteps by the deep state and the local police community.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  It's outrageous.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  It's unreal.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  I got to say, Jim, first of all, thank you for joining us here today.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  I want to encourage everyone, you know, check your website, thegatewaypuddin.com.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  You do great work.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  I have really been tracking your website over the last six months.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  It's the first thing I check every morning because you're breaking news early and often all throughout the day.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  And between Matt Drudge and your site and InfoWars and, you know, all the other independent media sites, it is, it's a whirlwind of information.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  Is there anything else you want to leave us with as we close out this segment here?
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  You know, I just, I think it's tragic what I'm witnessing today in America.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  I see how you're getting attacked.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  I see how Alex Jones getting attacked.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  Paul Joseph Watson, who is phenomenal, how he's getting attacked.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  And I just think it's tragic that this is going on in the West.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  And it's time for the people to stand up before there won't be anybody left to carry our message.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  And the attacks only make us stronger, don't they, Jim?
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  I mean, we're getting stronger.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  Let's hope so.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  I mean, we are galvanized to action to protect the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, this Republic, our liberty.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  Join us.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  Stay with us here after this break.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  And thank you, Jim Hoff from the Gateway Pundit.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  We'll be right back as we're talking with you.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  I was pretty surprised to see that it was not fully protective.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  Wallets by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising that they do.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  Get a stronghold on your credit cards, license, and other critical data with ID Stronghold Wallets.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  Other RFID blocking wallets simply aren't the same.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  ID Stronghold just outperformed them in every aspect.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  I would definitely recommend ID Stronghold Wallets to my friends and family.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  Check the label.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  If it doesn't say it's an ID Stronghold, it's not.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  I'm very impressed with the ID Stronghold Wallet.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  Get the most trusted brand in RFID blocking wallets and protect yourself from electronic pickpocketing.

[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  Mike Adams here, the health ranger filling in for Alex today. This is the tip of the spear of Liberty for America.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  We are all under attack. Our free speech is under serious assault today.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  I'm going to cover a few headlines here of what's going on just to bring you up to speed on the latest news.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  In the third hour, we're covering how the abortion industry generates garbage disposals to dump fetuses down the drains that go into the bio sludge that are then spread on crops as fertilizer to grow food for your consumption.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  You think about the food that's being fed to our school children in the public school system.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  It's actually grown in literally dead baby fertilizer.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  It's almost too sick to discuss but we have to tell the truth about this so that's coming up in the third hour here.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  Happening today, it's impossible to segue from something like that. I don't know what to say. It's just sick.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  Actually, let me just say this right now. The left is evil, pure evil. They are truly demonic in the level of evil that they are now exerting.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  They are, if you think about it, the people that they're trying to censor and shut down and bully are the people who are protecting life, people who are protecting Liberty, protecting free speech, protecting the right of self-defense, which is a divine right, by the way.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  If you look out across nature, you know, I'm a food scientist and I'm a natural health expert. All across nature, what I see is self-defense mechanisms in every animal, every plant.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  Did you know, for example, that dandelions have a self-defense mechanism? They actually emit a chemical that defends them against neighboring plants so that dandelion can grow without being invaded.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  I mean, dandelions have self-defense weapons. It's absolutely true. This is botany. This is basic science.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  And yet the left, the tyrannical deranged left, is trying to tell us that humans, obviously, hopefully a higher life form than dandelions, we don't have the right to self-defense.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  Well, we have to call 911 and wait for the same government people to show up and save us who refused to walk into that building in Parkland, Florida.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  They refused. They stood outside. They stood down while children were being shot up. These people are supposed to save us.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  We're supposed to give up our self-defense rights, a divine right reflected throughout nature, and trust a failed incompetent government system to protect us,
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  even knowing that that government is most likely to be weaponized against us, especially under a Democrat regime.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  I mean, if Hillary Clinton had been president, oh my God, I honestly think, I honestly think if Hillary Clinton had won, Alice Jones would be in jail right this minute.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  I think that Infowars would have been raided at gunpoint. I think they would have arrested me or shut me down or seized my domain name, you know, natural news.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  All of this would have happened if Hillary had won. So count your blessings right now.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  Thank God that we the people took a stand and that Hillary Clinton was defeated in that election, which means we have a fighting chance.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  We have a chance, maybe one of the most epic opportunities in the history of human civilization.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  Right now, a chance to fight back the currency of that fight, frankly, is revenue.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  Definitely support the Infowars Store. The sale is going on. There's free shipping right now across the country. InfowarsStore.com.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  This is how you power liberty. This is how Infowars funds its operation predominantly.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  You know, I think CNN is out there lying and saying that Infowars was funded by a few advertisers that they're trying to now stalk and bully into pulling their ads.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  As Alex explained in the first hour, you know, some advertisers would put a few ads on the YouTube channel for Infowars and then pull them off so they could say they pulled their ads.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  And I think one advertiser was like, what, $169 that they spent or something? It's a joke. It's essentially a lie to claim that that funds this operation.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  What really funds this operation is your support, InfowarsStore.com.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  And by the way, I have a unique perspective. You know, I'm a business owner. I've got my own operation, my own publishing, my own, you know, superfood manufacturing and all that.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  I understand how hard it is to do this. I understand. I know the compliance attorney for Infowars and he is keeping this operation compliant, label compliance, you know, quality control compliance, all these things.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  It is an amazing operation, but it needs your support. The other thing is, if you think about the deep state, the factions that are waging war against free speech, they can print money.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  They can create money from nothing. They've got central banks. They've got money floating around. They've got billions of dollars in offshore accounts.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  Any time they want, they can bring, you know, another couple of million dollars in to do whatever they want, hire a mob, rent a mob, a George Soros stage fake protests.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  I mean, even the Russians, right? Even the Russians had like an anti-Trump protest in New York City that Michael Moore was part of, you know, unwittingly.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  He didn't know it was by the Russians, but all these organizations can come up with money just like that, the deep state, the globalists, the people that are trying to take away your freedom.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  They've got endless money. Well, Infowars doesn't have, you know, a printing press that they can just print money.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  There's not a central bank hiding in the back room here. They depend on you. They depend on your support.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  So InfowarsStore.com. Let me go over a couple more headlines of things that are happening right now. CNN is reporting that they're sending a reporter to go visit some hookers in Thailand, at least one hooker that claims to have dirt on Trump.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  Imagine they're surprised when they find out she's a lady boy. So that's going to be an interesting segment.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  After stalking elderly women in their front yards, they're going to go visit lady boy prostitutes in Thailand. That's CNN for you right there, the Bully News Network.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  A new study claims bacon is linked to causing cancer. The reason I'm mentioning this is because I know it's actually from the sodium nitrite in processed bacon.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  Real fresh meat does not cause cancer unless you add the chemicals to it. I wanted to get that out there on the record. Bacon itself does not cause cancer.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  It's the nitrites that are added to it. Sodium nitrite causes colorectal cancer, causes pancreatic cancer. I've done extensive reporting on this in the past.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  Also, from one of my websites, science.news, once begun, there would be severe consequences to stopping climate intervention and geoengineering.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  Do you remember just two years ago, if you mentioned geoengineering, you were called the conspiracy theorist? What? No one's changing the climate?
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  No, there's no chemtrails. There's no geoengineering. Now, geoengineering is mainstream science talking about how they're going to save the planet from climate change.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  We need geoengineering. This is their argument now. We need geoengineering, but now they're warning, once we start it, we can't stop it because that might be catastrophic.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  What? What are they talking about? It's like, oh, we can't stop the chemtrails or that might destroy the planet. Really?
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  These people are insane. The science that's out there is fake science in exactly the same way that most of the news you're getting from the mainstream is fake news.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  In fact, on my website, science.news, I have a whole column that is science fails.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  It's like the homepage is like, good science, and then there's fake science because I wanted to highlight the fake science because in the realm of science, they try to pull the wool over your eyes and say, oh, it's science.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  You can't argue with it, just like those Parkland school kids. You can't argue with these kids. Why? Because they were shot at? You can't argue with them?
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  I don't know about you, but I've never seen a case where somebody was shot at and their IQ just automatically doubled on complex social issues.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  I mean, I'm not saying they don't have a right to speak out. They do, but being shot at does not turn you into a genius overnight.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  Frankly, it doesn't work that way. Bullets don't impart cognitive genius onto their intended targets. They do quite the opposite.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  And, you know, they're just lying with science constantly. So that's why we put that out there. We've got, oh, I don't even know if I should get started with this one.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  Yeah, we're going to go to break here soon because the next thing I've got coming up is so mind blowing, you won't even believe it.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  It's about they're saying that aliens could crash the US power grid, not illegal aliens, but little green men aliens.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  That's what they're saying. Scientists are saying the power grid could go down because of aliens from another planet.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  I'm not even making this up. Stay with me here. This is the Alex Jones show. Mike Adams filling in today.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  We'll be back after this break with that story and much more.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  To improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  Over a year in the making produced by one of the top organic firms in the country that if you want proven studies and documentation,
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  I'm going to speak for hours just on the files I have here of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  But immune wall is incredible at folks.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  Other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80. It's a great deal at $39.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more. It is concentrated. You need to go read what is in here. The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  A citrus peel blend. I mean, this is the next level. It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall. I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  You are back at the tip of the spear here fighting for your liberty, your right to speak your mind, even your right to think, your right to disagree, your right to ask questions, your right to engage in debate.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today and as part of the bullying of the left that is attempting to stamp out everyone's speech who disagrees with the delusional rhetoric of the left.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  Ted Nugent is being censored as well. There are efforts underway to crush his upcoming tour in the name of political correctness.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  Yes, they're attacking music and speech and religion in America. I mean, is there anything that the left won't try to destroy on their march toward tyranny?
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  The answer is there's nothing that they won't try to destroy. But Ted Nugent has a video. It's about a four minute clip here. He's going to tell you what's going on and why he's under attack as well.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  Let's listen to that and then I'll be back.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  Right now is a full force attack from truth, logic and common sense Americans.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  We're seeing right now the biggest purge online of conservative sites, veteran sites, gun sites, shooting clubs, Christian sites. I've never seen such a purge.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  I've been, I've been thrown off forever. But this year I had this great tour and all the promoters are coming up. Nugent's coming back out. Book Nugent, Book Nugent.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  I won't mention any names now in hopes that the negotiations can continue and move forward on an honest level.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  But I have been thrown out by the biggest promoters in the world because I'm on the board of the NRA.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  And I promise you, if I was recently arrested for heroin distribution, they would have not thrown me off.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  Exactly.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  But because I'm on the board of the family grassroots organization of the National Rifle Association, this stands for self defense.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  I've been thrown off tens of millions of dollars in revenue because I believe in self defense.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  Exactly. And that's the sacrifice that, I mean, you go to the Rolling Stone articles attacking you and I this week.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  They'll get one or two comments. Your side has thousands per story, so does mine at 50 times the traffic.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  So I'm saying, you're right, they have had a cardiac arrest. They're falling apart.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  But I don't want to underestimate their counter offensive.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  No, no, we don't. It doesn't mean that we are complacent by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  Right now is a full force attack from truth, logic and common sense Americans to continue to crush the dishonesty and the political correctness.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  So I'm not, I'm not compromised or controlled by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  I'm still making the greatest music of my life with the greatest band, the greatest crew and the greatest management, the greatest family.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  Well, you seem to be even more empowered in this fight now than trying to hold you down.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  I think political correctness has backfired and even though fake news and the orchestrated lies of the media starting in the late 60s, quite honestly,
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  some people fell for it, but then when they really tune in and pay attention, they see how dishonest it is.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  And my backing and my support is at an all time high right now.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  Look at all the claims that I'm a child molester, a draft dodger, that I diss the Native Americans. It's all lies.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  What nasty things, especially my relationship with the Native Americans.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  I have been invited to almost every Native American tribe to teach their children the Native lifestyle of clean and sober, hands-on conservation,
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  self-sufficiency, hunting, fishing, outdoor conservation, shared sweat lodges with their spiritual leaders since the 60s.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  I have been given felonious eagle feather war bonnets by the elders of numerous tribes because I, in my song Great White Buffalo,
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  and in my promotion of conservation, especially bow hunting, they feel a kinship, a blood brotherhood there with me.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  So, meanwhile, the Native Americans and I are spiritual blood brothers, so the Huffington Post claims that I called him unclean vermin.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  And then some people actually fell for it. So, you can see that as I say these things, as nasty and horrific and dishonest as they are,
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  you notice I'm still smiling because I can plow through the dishonesty and the bull*** and still connect with people who were in the acid column.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  Thank you. I believe the positive spirit is as strong as it's ever been.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  You are the resistance, and thank you for tuning in today. This is the Alex Jones show Mike Adams filling in today because this is a collaborative effort at this point.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  We are fighting for our survival and we're fighting for your right to exist.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  You got to understand that the attacks on free speech are not just to silence people like Alex Jones or myself.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  Ultimately, the left believes that you, a conservative, liberty minded individual or a Christian individual or a gun owning individual,
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  they believe that you have no right to exist.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  I want you to understand that the kind of philosophy that the left has now adopted is frankly, it's the kind of thing that has led throughout history to mass genocide and mass executions.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  This is like cultural revolution, communist China, the Mao takeover where young people were told to kill their elders and drag them out of their homes and literally execute them
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  and beat them on the head with bricks and baseball bats until they were dead and to call the government to come arrest their own parents.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  And they dragged people out who are the intellectual leaders of the day, people who they were targeted for wearing glasses because they thought people who wore glasses were intelligent and could read and could think.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  And so they terminated them because the communist regime cannot tolerate anyone who can think.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  That's why, I mean, who watches CNN and believes anything except truly a dumbed down info consumer who has been mass hypnotized, indoctrinated, chemically contaminated with crazy food additives, fluoride in the water supply, everything else.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  Who actually, what thinking person could believe anything that they see on CNN?
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  It's outrageous.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  So I want to thank Ted Nugent for that segment there.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  And as I promised before the break, here's a fascinating story that you won't see.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  Well, I guess it is in the media.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  It's called, all right, check this out.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  Bizarre research paper.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  This is from, by the way, news.com.au.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  Bizarre research paper explores the possible scenarios of Earth intercepting an alien message.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  Now, according to this paper, the title of the science paper is interstellar communication, message decontamination is impossible.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  And the scientists who worked on this are Michael Hipke and John Learned.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  It's what it looks like.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  University of Hawaii is one of them.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  Just to break it down for you, this paper, at least one interpretation of it, claims that alien messages could crash the US power grid.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  Now, it sounds insane, but here it is.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  It's in the science paper.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  It's in the university.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  I, when I saw this, I thought immediately, this sounds like a cover story.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  And I thought, you know, there is a major false flag coming, no doubt in my mind.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  This is one of the reasons that they're trying to silence info wars and silence, you know, my website, natural news and all the other voices out there.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  I think there is a major, major false flag coming.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  And previously I thought, well, maybe that could be a dirty bomb.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  You know, like someone gets some medical imaging equipment, some radioisotopes wraps it around like a conventional explosive and gets a, you know, drops it out of a Cessna over a city or something.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  You know, because that's what terrorists do.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  But now I'm thinking, what if they crashed the whole power grid and blamed it on aliens?
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  Yes, you see, they can't blame it on the Russians because no one would believe that at this point.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  Oh, that might have been the previous cover story.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  Maybe we'll try to blame Alex Jones.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  Like Alex Jones crashed the national power grid.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  No, they, they can't blame it on climate change because no one believes that story anymore, even though the mainstream science tries to blame everything on climate change.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  Like, oh, the loss of libido in women 25 to 30 caused by climate change.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  You know, you see these articles everywhere.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  It's insane.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  They have to have a new boogeyman.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  So I think they're going to blame the aliens like actual little green men from Planet Zorg.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  And they could just turn off all the power grid.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  Just, just have like a, like a deep state built Stuxnet virus, you know, because, hey, the US intelligence built that thing.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  They took out the centrifuge systems in Iran, their nuclear program.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  They could take down the US power grid, right?
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  Just crash the whole system, unleash mass chaos in the cities.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  And by the time the power grid comes back on, like they'll have assassinated Trump.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  Infowars.com domain name will be turned into like a daily happiness tips blog.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  And they'll have Hillary Clinton in the White House and CNN will claim that Trump never won the election at all.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  What do you, what's his conspiracy theories? You think Trump won the election?
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  No, the memory hold last year and a half.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  And they'll say, no, Hillary's always been president.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  And they'll just silence everybody.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  They just put up this crazy insane picture.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  I'm laughing.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  It's like Hillary as an alien gray with black eyes.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  It's insane.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  I'm just telling you, I don't believe this stuff.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  I think, I think it's nonsense, but it's the kind of thing that they, the legacy media would try to push.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  As a cover story for anything they want to pull off.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  It's insane.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  There's a lot more coming here.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  A lot of interesting news ahead on the Alice Jones show.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  Thank you for joining me.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  Mike Adams filling in.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  We'll be right back after this break.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  I want to plow into all of this.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  That I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  Infowarslife.com or AAA2533139.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.000]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  Fluorolife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, but gut lining and metabolism.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:39.000]  Fluorolife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.

[01:59:44.000 --> 02:00:09.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:15.000]  We're listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  Alright, thank you for joining us in this segment. This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show. We're going to be joined after this next segment by another person who has been targeted in a censorship purge that the radical left says is not happening.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  Oh, it's not happening. No one's being purged except everyone that we know is being censored and bullied and cut off and economically sabotaging. You name it.
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  But we're going to be joined by Gary Franchi from the Next News Network.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  And last segment we're joined by Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit. If you missed that, you definitely want to check out that video online.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  Just a couple of minutes here before we get that started. I'm going to cover some headlines.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  Also, we're going to take calls in this third hour. So the phone number is 877-789-2539.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  I'll repeat it again in the next segment, but it's 877-789-2539, and I very much welcome your calls.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  For the rest of this segment, I want to answer a couple of questions people have been asking me.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  So, number one, this is funny, like, dude, why is your face kind of red here on the Infowars Studio?
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  Truth be told, I'm actually Native American. There's a lot of Native American blood in my blood, and my face tends to be sort of reddish-colored, which is really interesting.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  I'm not actually steaming mad or anything. I'm actually having a great time here hosting the Infowars broadcast.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  But also, I do a lot of outside training. I'm outside a lot. I get a lot of sun. You know, I live on a ranch.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  I take care of donkeys and goats and the free-range chickens that we have.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  And I also train outdoors with firearms training. So I do a lot of tactical firearms training, carbine training, pistol training, long-range target shooting.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  It's all outdoors. You know, there is no thousand-yard indoor range that I've ever found. You're going to shoot a thousand yards.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  You've got to go outdoors. So I'm outdoors a lot, doing a lot of training, getting up to speed. I've been doing it for years.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  Very, very competent in firearms, which I believe all of us need to be.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  You just never know what the crime going through the roof and the assaults on our liberties.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  You know, the Second Amendment is not just designed to protect us from tyrants. It's also important to protect us from, you know, a liberal mob of people trying to kill us
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  and trying to take away, you know, our property. Think about communism. Every time it takes over a country, they steal your land.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  They steal your businesses, right? They arrest those who are resisting communism.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  And frankly, there are many cases throughout history. If the people had firearms, they'd be able to fight back.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  I mean, even Nazi Germany and the Jews, if the Jewish people had been fully armed, they could have resisted more effectively.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  They could have taken out more Nazi soldiers. Even if they didn't 100 percent win, they would have made it more costly to the Germans.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  And I believe, isn't there a group today called Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership? J-P-F-O, I think, is an actual group out there.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  And I think their slogan is something like, never forget, firearms are for protecting us from tyranny.
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  And that message has never been more true than it is right now here in the United States today.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  They're coming for our speech. They're coming for our guns. They're coming for everything, our privacy.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  They're silencing us. They're committing economic sabotage. They're going after us at every level.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  While they're saying, oh, it's not even happening, this is not happening, don't watch.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  Don't look while we're bashing everybody and try to ruin them economically. It's insane.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  But coming up in the next segment, we're going to talk to Gary Franchi, who has more thoughts on censorship of the media.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  And we'll take your call-ins, your calls, 877-789-2539 is the number to call in.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  And I especially would love your questions for me.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  It's been four and a half, maybe five years since I hosted here on InfoWars.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  And I really welcome your questions and I really appreciate you. I appreciate your support.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  I appreciate what you do for this liberty stand that we're taking here to try to defend what we have in this country.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  You are the reason we're able to be here and do this, so I want to hear from you.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  I definitely call in and I look forward to taking your calls.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  Mike Adams here filling in for Alex Jones. We'll be right back after this break.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  Music
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  Feel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  Don't let a meal go to waste. Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:56.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now. That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:01.000]  Thank you for watching!
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  You know, part of the extreme deception by the left is not only the targeting of conservative and libertarian voices for censorship,
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  but also their absurd claim that there is no targeting going on.
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:57.000]  I mean, this is just epic. This is a whole new level of deception that they're engaged in.
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  It's like they would go to a community of liberty-minded, like a liberty neighborhood somewhere at 3 in the morning
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:09.000]  and just kick down everybody's door and shoot people in the head, and then claim,
[02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.000]  we didn't shoot anybody in the head. No, they ran into door stops.
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:18.000]  We're not doing that. No, no, we love all those people. We love the First Amendment.
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  No, you don't. You hate the First Amendment. You leftists. You globalists. You evil operatives.
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  You hate America. You hate liberty. You hate independent thinking. You hate voices of truth and freedom.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  And that's why you're trying to crush them while claiming you're not crushing anything.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  You're not fooling anybody. You're just not fooling anybody.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  And joining us in this segment is someone else who is not fooled but is being targeted as further evidence that this targeting is systematic.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:54.000]  It's happening. The purge is on, and it is specifically singling out voices who are pro-liberty.
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:57.000]  His name is Gary Franchi. He's from Next News Network.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  He joins us now by Skype to discuss what's been happening to him.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  Gary, welcome to The Alice Jones Show.
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000]  Hey, Mike, it's great to see you.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  That's good to have you on. Now, you've seen what's happening out there. Tell us how you are being censored and demonetized and targeted so that, you know, the listeners can hear.
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  This is not just me or Alex or Jim Hoft. It's you too. It's many people out there. What's happening to you?
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  Well, what we've seen through our analytics since, well, I mean, of course, we have the adpocalypse, which took place back in March.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  But we also are looking at the analytics from late October last year. We saw a 75% drop in viewership.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  And we attribute that to an algorithm shift that YouTube announced.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  And now, if you take a look at the analytics between CNN, MSNBC, all these different left-wing media outlets, you compare them against Alex Jones, Next News Network, Infowars.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  You compare the viewership rating through like social blade. You can actually see a specific and real, like it's like the complete shift.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  Ours goes down while theirs goes up. This is all reactionary from the election. They are so upset that they lost the election and they continue to blame social media, conservative viewpoints.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  They blame all these viewpoints so that they can suppress our voices and then they go ahead and they weight the scales in the algorithm so that our stuff goes down and theirs goes up.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  That's just one point that we noticed back in October.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  They're admitting that we are being effective, that in fact we are persuasive because if you think about it, their position is that things that you say are things that Alex says are total nonsense and thus don't make any sense.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  Well, then why censor them? If what you're saying, Gary, is complete nonsense, then why not allow you to broadcast your nonsense and look like a fool to the world?
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  But in truth, you make a lot of sense. You're invoking logic and reason. You are bringing people real truth and real news and it is compelling and that's why we're being censored.
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  Does that sound right?
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  They don't want people to think. They want people to be drones. They want people to just go about their daily lives and just having no critical thoughts.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  It's demanded conformity, yes.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  Exactly. So we're making people think and then that creates a reaction. They have to make a decision and what do they do?
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  They vote in the polls. They vote for Donald Trump and then they come back and they try to blame the people for influencing them when we're presenting simple facts and information.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  I mean, we're getting attacked by the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian. We're getting attacked at all fronts and now we're seeing the demonization.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  Mike, what I have to go through every single day, every single day, when I go through my document and I take a look at all the articles I'm going to read for the day, I have to do a keyword scrub.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  For words I know are going to get flagged by the system, by the algorithm.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  What are some of those keywords? Just tell us what some of those words are.
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  One thing, sure, we noticed this a time ago, it's ISIS. It's something you cannot say.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  ISIS.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  What happens is when you say ISIS, the voice print analysis at YouTube, what happens is it takes your voice, puts it into text and that creates metadata for the system and then they demonetize it.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  Wow.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  I've been scrubbing Parkland. I've been scrubbing Parkland, shooting.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  I mean, we noticed just the day we did a report where there were scrubbing guns from the shopping tab at Google.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  Wow.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  Yeah, of course.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  That's been widely reported.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  By the way, I'm going to keep it to the next segment, but change your background from an animation to a still image and your frame rate will improve.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  It's causing a very slow frame rate, but that's just a technical issue.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  What you're saying is right on point, and this is systematic targeting.
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  What are you hearing from other people?
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  Because you have a lot of contacts in, you know, conservative news as well.
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  What are you hearing from other people?
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  Are they experiencing the same targeting that you're being subjected to or are some people getting by unscathed?
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  No, I think it's actually, there are people getting completely banned from YouTube.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  I mean, they're getting shut down, free strike.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  Yeah.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  I mean, that's it.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  They just took me on Saturday, by the way, they just took down the whole health ranger account, 1700 plus videos, just gone.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  Yeah.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  You're one of the effective parties, and hopefully we can get some help for you there.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  I mean, we had a strike on our channel because we used the term crisis actor in a video that was three years old, and it wasn't even related to anything other than a military exercise in Arizona.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  Yeah, but just the term crisis actor gets you flagged, right?
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  Just the term crisis actor gets you flagged, you know, the term false flag.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  Anything that has to do with any sort of shooting or critical crisis deal.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  It's like, man, you have to scrub, you have to use generalized terminology just so you can speak the truth.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  Well, this is fascinating.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  I guess the new narrative is that when there's a shooting that no one can ask any questions now whatsoever.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  If children were killed in this event, which they were, that you can't even like journalism is now illegal in America surrounding shooting events.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  You can't ask questions.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  You can't voice a differing opinion.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  You can't criticize, you know, a CNN journalist covering their fake journalists.
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  It's the new Stasi.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:30.000]  It's the new SS of the news that condemns anybody who has a differing opinion.
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  Where do you think this is headed, Gary?
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  Well, I think the worst part about it is you got these kids coming out and the kids are being manipulated by the media and by the leftists.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  So that the kids are untouchable.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  I think that's probably one of the scariest thing that we've seen come out of this last events is that the manipulation of children to further the agenda.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  But that's, I guess it's been going on for a long time, Mike.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  They always say it's for the children, for the children.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  But now they get some young, fresh-faced kids who have been just recently, you know, victimized in a very, very graphic situation.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  And now, and they can articulate, they can go in front of the cameras, they can repeat talking points.
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  And I think that's really the scariest thing coming out of it.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  And unfortunately, I think we're going to see more of that because they see the effectiveness of it.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  And they're using that as the weapon, the bludgeon to shut down free speech and any critical thoughts or critical questions of those narratives.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  Right. And Jim Hoff was telling us in the last hour that they're now indoctrinating children as young as nine years old to join these anti-gun marches.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  I mean, you talk about brainwashing.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  I mean, and they don't tell the kids that it is disarmed populations throughout history that have been exterminated by government genocide.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  The term is called democide.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  262 million people have been murdered by governments in the last, like, century and a half.
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  262 million people.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  How come they're not marching against genocide to say, hey, the Second Amendment protects us, protects our rights, protects us against tyranny?
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  You know, they're never being told that.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  But Gary, stay with us.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000]  I'm going to hold you over for the next segment.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  I just want to mention to people, I think you should call your representatives in Washington today.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  Here's the switchboard number for the U.S. Capitol.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  202-224-3121.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  That number again is 202-224-3121 and demand antitrust action and regulation of these tech giant companies to halt their politically biased censorship.
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  This is the action item for today.
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  Call the Capitol switchboard, 202-224-3121, demand antitrust action and regulatory protections of free speech in the online ecosystem.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  This is crucial.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  We'll be right back with more here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  Mike Adams filling in today.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  We're talking with Gary Franchi of Next News Network.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:56.000]  We'll be right back after this break.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banion Hill.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  You like freedom?
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  I do.
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  You like money?
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  I do too.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  If you like freedom and money, then you're going to love freedom checks.
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who states their claim.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  If you heard that right, $34.6 billion.
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:22.000]  To get all the details, just go to www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  Thousands of people already lined up to cash in.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  Take Doug, for example.
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  He's a 46-year-old from Joplin, Missouri who's set to get a check for $24,075.
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000]  If Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can too.
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  But here's the thing.
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  If you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion payout,
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:44.000]  you must have your ducks in a row by April 1st.
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  So don't wait.

[03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:32.000]  He literally thought a tweet from Donald Trump would make the planet uninhabitable.
[03:49:32.000 --> 03:49:35.000]  This is tough geopolitical posturing.
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:40.000]  Now, what was the response from other talking heads to Trump's tweet back in early January?
[03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:48.000]  Well, NBC News national security analyst Jeremy Bash said that it would cause Kim Jong-un to, quote, lash out.
[03:49:48.000 --> 03:49:54.000]  He said, quote, this is a tweet that could lead to confrontation and maybe even war.
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:50:05.000]  Bear in mind, this is the same media that fee among us every single day about Russia and invents conspiracies about Russian collusion that have put the planet at the greatest risk of nuclear war since the Cold War.
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:14.000]  Oh, but when it comes to Trump tweeting, no, that's going to lead to war, according to NBC national security analyst Jeremy Bash.
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:19.000]  What did CNN's Brian Stelter say in response to this tweet?
[03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:23.000]  He said that it was evidence that Trump was mentally unstable.
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:27.000]  What would we say if the leader of Germany or China or Brazil posted tweets like Trump's?
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:28.000]  How would we cover it?
[03:50:28.000 --> 03:50:30.000]  We'd say that person is not well.
[03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:34.000]  Point being, they all completely freaked out over this tweet.
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:41.000]  Said it was a horrific diplomatic blunder that it was putting the planet at risk of being uninhabitable.
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  What happened within hours of Trump sending out that tweet?
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:51.000]  Well, North Korea reestablished communications with South Korea for the first time in nearly two years.
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:54.000]  What happened today?
[03:50:54.000 --> 03:50:56.000]  Headline breakthrough.
[03:50:56.000 --> 03:51:01.000]  North Korea ready to denuclearize if regime safety is guaranteed.
[03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:03.000]  This is zero hedge.
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:12.000]  Score another diplomatic victory for Trump whose hardline negotiation negotiating tactic appears to have generated a dramatic and favorable outcome.
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:21.000]  An outcome that the Financial Times dubbed a diplomatic breakthrough that North and South Korea have agreed to hold direct talks between their leaders.
[03:51:21.000 --> 03:51:29.000]  With North Korea signalling, it is willing to abandon its nuclear program if regime security can be guaranteed.
[03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:31.000]  The markets are loving it.
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:38.000]  It's a tough geopolitical stance by Trump that increased the likelihood that this would happen.
[03:51:38.000 --> 03:51:43.000]  In other words, not just the tweet, but the tweet worked.
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:46.000]  They immediately started to back away.
[03:51:46.000 --> 03:51:58.000]  Now they're in talks to denuclearize entirely, as opposed to Obama who just made it worse, as opposed to Clinton back in the 90s who gave them the technology to build the nukes in the first place.
[03:51:58.000 --> 03:52:04.000]  So again, the mainstream media has been completely debunked with its hysteria.
[03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:06.000]  They said this could lead to global war.
[03:52:06.000 --> 03:52:08.000]  They said it was a horrific mistake.
[03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:13.000]  They've been proven wrong once again by reality.
[03:52:13.000 --> 03:52:21.000]  Absolutely incredible, but we're making great progress on North Korea by taking an actual stance against them and they appear.
[03:52:21.000 --> 03:52:25.000]  Although it's often not certain, of course, but they appear to be backing away.
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:29.000]  What Trump's doing is working and the mainstream media are just going to have to deal with that.
[03:52:29.000 --> 03:52:32.000]  They've been completely debunked.
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:39.000]  Let's move on to Italy, where, of course, the populist party and the center-right coalition swept to power.
[03:52:39.000 --> 03:52:46.000]  Obviously, only one of them can take power, but the center-left Democrats, the globalist party, was completely decimated.
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:50.000]  They performed even worse than the polls suggested.
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:58.000]  So now you're going to have a jockeying for position between the populist five-star movement and the center-right coalition,
[03:52:58.000 --> 03:53:03.000]  which is Forza Italia and the Northern League, led by Matteo Salvini.
[03:53:03.000 --> 03:53:08.000]  Actually, Salvini won in the duel between the two parties in the right-wing coalition.
[03:53:08.000 --> 03:53:15.000]  So if it comes to that coalition taking power, Salvini will be the prime minister.
[03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:23.000]  Massive rejection of globalism, massive rejection of open borders, massive rejection of the European Union.
[03:53:23.000 --> 03:53:26.000]  Now, how was it reported in the media aftermath?
[03:53:26.000 --> 03:53:32.000]  Who's to blame for this crushing populist victory in Italy?
[03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:34.000]  What were the consequences that led to it?
[03:53:34.000 --> 03:53:40.000]  Was it the horrific migrant wave that was pouring into Italy, pouring into their southern towns from Libya?
[03:53:40.000 --> 03:53:45.000]  Did it have anything to do with the fact that their economy is in complete malaise?
[03:53:45.000 --> 03:53:47.000]  They've still got massive unemployment.
[03:53:47.000 --> 03:53:52.000]  Was it anything to do with the fact that they've got a horrible relationship with the EU and it's not working for them?
[03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:57.000]  So, Italian voters didn't vote based on any of that. It was all thanks to Russia.
[03:53:57.000 --> 03:54:03.000]  Oh yes, the Marussian conspiracy theory is back once again.
[03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:07.000]  This is zero hedge. Russia blamed for Italian election outcome.
[03:54:07.000 --> 03:54:11.000]  If there's a European election and the anti-establishment party score a stunning victory,
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:18.000]  as just happened in Italy in a few months prior in Austria, and in Germany, by the way, who are you going to blame?
[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:25.000]  Vladimir Putin, of course, that's what Samantha Power, one of the top diplomats in the Obama administration, did
[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:32.000]  when she shared an article by Spain's El Pace newspaper about how Russia predetermined the outcome of Sunday's election
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:35.000]  by spinning an immigrant discourse in Italy.
[03:54:35.000 --> 03:54:42.000]  So, because some Russian news outlets talked about the fact that Italy had a problem with mass immigration,
[03:54:42.000 --> 03:54:48.000]  with literally, like, 20-something-year-old girls being butchered and cannibalized,
[03:54:48.000 --> 03:54:52.000]  which happened, I think it was in Rome or another big Italian city a few weeks ago,
[03:54:52.000 --> 03:54:56.000]  they actually found that they cannibalized the woman. It was a migrant that carried out the murder.
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:01.000]  Massive problems with this onrush of immigrants from Libya, people smugglers.
[03:55:01.000 --> 03:55:05.000]  Now, that's all, that didn't happen. Nobody voted on that basis.
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:10.000]  They voted because Russia talked about it in their media. Absolutely incredible.
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  By the way, Samantha Power's all concerned about foreign interventions.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:21.000]  This is the same woman who was a water carrier for the U.S. intervention under Obama into Libya,
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  a complete disaster which led to the migrant crisis in the first place.
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:31.000]  Oh, but now she's up there whining about foreign intervention.
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:34.000]  She's the queen of foreign intervention.
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:40.000]  Trying to claim that Russia, talking about the problems Italy has in its media,
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:45.000]  is why people voted for populist parties, why people voted for center-right parties.
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:50.000]  No, it's because they have massive problems with migration, massive problems with their economy.
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:55.000]  They've got 38% youth unemployment. They've got a terrible relationship with the EU.
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:56:02.000]  They've got a record debt load. They voted for change because their country was going down the toilet.
[03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:09.000]  They had nothing to do with more Russia, Samantha Power. Absolutely incredible.
[03:56:09.000 --> 03:56:14.000]  Majority of Italian youngsters backed Eurosceptic anti-establishment parties.
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:19.000]  I was talking about this earlier. Conservatism is the new counterculture, not just culturally, but politically.
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:27.000]  We saw the same thing in France, remember, where 44% of youngsters backed Marine Le Pen, the populist candidate.
[03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:35.000]  Now, youngsters in Italy voted overwhelmingly in favor of Eurosceptic anti-mass migration parties in the country's election on Sunday.
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:43.000]  According to a survey by Technic, a whopping 44% of those aged 18 to 30 backed the five-star movement,
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:50.000]  whilst a further 13% voted for the anti-Euroliga, which is Matteo Salvini.
[03:56:50.000 --> 03:56:52.000]  He's probably going to be the next leader.
[03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:56.000]  Another 3% of youngsters backed nationalist brothers of Italy, meaning that in total,
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:57:05.000]  60% of young Italians backed parties critical of the Euro anti-establishment and anti-mass migration.
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:13.000]  So again, the Eurosceptic rebellion, fueled by young Europeans, continues to surge across the continent.
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:19.000]  This is fundamentally a youth movement. It's growing. It's becoming more pervasive.
[03:57:19.000 --> 03:57:26.000]  It's resonating with young people, just like InfoWars, just like my YouTube channel, is resonating with young people.
[03:57:26.000 --> 03:57:34.000]  And that's why the establishment haters, they are in a blind panic because their audience is literally dying.
