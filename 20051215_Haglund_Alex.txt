[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]  In fact, I want to play that clip from the Lone Gunman right now.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.680]  Go ahead and roll that clip where they're describing why this terrorist event is going
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.840]  to take place.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.320]  You have kind of the boss of the conspiracy terrorists talking to his father who's in
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.320]  the government.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.320]  Right.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.320]  And so they're talking.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.320]  Go ahead and roll that.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.320]  We know it's a war game scenario and it has to do with airline counter-terrorism.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.240]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.240]  Because it's no longer a game.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.240]  If some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario, why target you for assassination?
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.240]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.240]  The men who conceived of it in the first place.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.240]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic airline?
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.240]  There you go.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.240]  Inditing the entire government as usual.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.160]  It's a faction.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160]  A small, factual, what possible game.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160]  The Cold War is over, John.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.160]  But with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market is flat.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.160]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City and you'll find a
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.160]  dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility and
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160]  begging to be smart-bombed.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.160]  I can't believe it.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.160]  This is about increasing our sales.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.160]  When?
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.080]  Tonight?
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.080]  How are you going to stop them?
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.080]  That's what it looks like.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080]  With this what?
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.080]  I mean, now we cut the plane.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.080]  Right.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.080]  Remote access.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.080]  Somebody on the ground is flying your plane.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.080]  That's me.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.080]  You break in and save the people.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.080]  That's right.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.080]  Losing our flight plan.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080]  World Trade Center.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.080]  Right, yeah.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.080]  I'm mapping the data now.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080]  Yeah, he's on the plane.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080]  We're on the ground.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080]  On the cell phone.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.080]  On the phone for the plane.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  You know, I actually want the DVDs of this.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  This is just ripped off the webs here.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  So the audio isn't the best.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  Here it is.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  The corner of Liberty and Washington.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  Lower Manhattan.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]  World Trade Center.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]  I'm going to crash the plane into the World Trade Center.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]  I'll tell the flight crew.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  Alright.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.920]  Now we shot that in March of 2000.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.920]  So that script was written probably around January.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920]  January, February 2000.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.920]  And then that aired.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920]  That would have been September, I think.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.920]  Or maybe even January 2001.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.920]  Because it was a mid-season replacement.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.920]  And then September 2001 had happened.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.920]  And I didn't even put it together.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.920]  It was the writers who actually called me in the afternoon.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920]  Going, are you watching this?
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.840]  One of the writers from the X-Files was calling me.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.840]  You'd been fixing your sink, right?
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.840]  Exactly.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.840]  You remember that.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840]  Yeah.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840]  My sink went.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.840]  I was at Home Depot.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.840]  I had other issues than watching TV all day.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.840]  And then suddenly it all gelled together all at once.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.840]  That's kind of good that you were so unplugged from mainstream media that you didn't even know it was happening.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.840]  Well, I heard about it.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.840]  I knew it right when it happened.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.840]  Well, sure.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.840]  So they called you.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.840]  But you hadn't gotten all the details.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840]  I understand.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840]  Yeah.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.840]  Yeah.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840]  It was really amazing.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760]  Nobody was there.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.760]  Nobody was there.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760]  And everybody was really helpful.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760]  So Chris Carter called you up.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.760]  Yeah.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760]  It was actually Vince.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.760]  Vince Gilligan, who called me up.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.760]  As I said, are you watching that?
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.760]  Because Vince was the real spearhead for getting the gunman to the air.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.760]  Chris Carter and everybody were involved in writing it.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.760]  But they were also involved with trying to save season eight of the X-Files and bring that show to a close somehow.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.760]  So the focus was split.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.680]  The writers were writing long gunman episodes and writing X-Files episodes at the same time.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.680]  I actually saw news articles where Ashcroft went to Hollywood right after 9-11 and said,
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.680]  no more bad stories on us.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680]  We want you to work with us.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.680]  And then I remember hearing in a news article that Fox didn't like the gunman because it was anti-government.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.680]  And then I remember seeing that you guys had gotten good ratings and it was a very popular series.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680]  Why cancel a winner?
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.680]  Yeah.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.600]  There's a series of reasons, including I wrote a comic book called Why the Long Gunman Was Cancelled.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.600]  Because it's such an involved story that involves not just bad ratings.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]  Oh, get off the air.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600]  The ratings were good.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.600]  The show was fairly inexpensive.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600]  We were shooting up in Vancouver, so it wasn't about cost.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.600]  Chris Carter and Fox at this point started having a bad relationship.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.600]  So that may have played into it.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600]  But yeah, there may have been a larger...
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600]  Just a microcosm of that.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.600]  I mean, I've been on local radio and number one show at night against everything, making the station tons of money.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.600]  And they just said, stop talking about the government or you're fired.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600]  And I didn't shut up and they fired me.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600]  So they had people lean on them.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600]  That's just at a local level.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.600]  Now it's come out about hundreds and hundreds.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.600]  And I'm telling you, it's thousands of reporters on government payrolls, not just in Iraq with fake news, but fake news here.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.600]  Fake news here.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.600]  And not only that, Chris Carter tells a story.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:18.600]  And I met the psychic who was hired by the CIA just to hang out at Hollywood parties and then go back and drop emails about what she talked about.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.600]  And this was the CIA keeping tabs on producers and writers of Hollywood movies because that's the...
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.600]  Because a psychic with them is like their psychologist.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600]  These people spill their guts.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600]  They spill their guts.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.600]  And she went up to Chris Carter, who was at a party way in the back.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.600]  She said, whatever you're working on is going to make you millions of dollars.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.600]  And this was before he had launched the X-Files.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.600]  And he actually told that same story, collaborated.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.600]  Now also you guys talk about the CIA, NASA, others planting ideas and scripts.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600]  And I mean, come on.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.600]  This is exactly what happened on 9-11.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.600]  There is a government drill, actually five drills going on of flying planes into the very buildings.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.600]  Now that's USA Today, folks.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.600]  We told you that from our sources two and a half years before it was in USA Today.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.600]  Now it's admitted.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.600]  Yeah.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600]  Okay.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]  But we have this from our sources.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600]  Now it's admitted they have this drill.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:13.600]  In the lone government pilot episode, this criminal group of the government is going to use a drill to make the rest of the government stand down.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600]  Yeah.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.600]  And they're going to fly it into there to attack Afghanistan, to smart bomb the ten-horn dictators.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.600]  I mean, you cannot get any closer.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.600]  I know.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.600]  And then to say, oh, we had no indication that this would ever happen.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.600]  This was like the government's position.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.600]  There was no information that this would happen.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.600]  It was everywhere.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]  It was in your popular media.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.600]  It's in your books.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.600]  Specifically, were you able to talk to Chris Carter and others?
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.600]  I mean, was that storyline planted on them?
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.600]  Where did they get that?
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.600]  They said they got it from Tom Clancy novel.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.600]  I forget which one.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.600]  Which it's admitted that Tom does get that from the intelligence agency.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.600]  So it probably was then second or third hand.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.600]  There's a drill to make everybody stand down, but his book doesn't do that.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.600]  That part was added.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.600]  I mean, I'll tell you, the mathematical chance of that happening.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.600]  But then what about the New York Lottery coming up 9-1-1 on 9-1-1 the year after?
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.600]  What about the Chicago Mercantile coming up 9-1-1 with a bunch of zeros after it?
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.600]  I mean, that was like one out of 14 billion.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600]  Yeah, what are the odds of that?
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600]  And how does that work?
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:19.600]  And this then goes back to a collective unconscious idea that there is a larger subconscious idea going on that then influences our reality.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.600]  Well, we know from what's even declassified.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.600]  They're trying to actually program that through.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.600]  And they know that we need to see symbols to somehow control that collective unconscious.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.600]  That they're trying to program with these subliminals.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.600]  Yeah.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600]  Well, and I don't know how much that works because it will go in both directions.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600]  I agree.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.600]  And show that you and others and everybody doing this kind of work sort of will make a groundswell going the other way.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.600]  Dean, I want to go to break and I want to come back and find out what you think of the torture.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.600]  I have no idea what your views are.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.600]  Right.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.600]  What you think of the Pentagon domestic surveillance in America.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.600]  These announcements that federal troops are going to march around on our street corners now.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.600]  I just heard that.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600]  Shake us down.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.600]  Homeland Security quote fight terrorists and drugs or terrorism.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.600]  So, we have to have neighborhood groups with the military watching us.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.600]  I want to get your views on all of this.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.600]  But then it's okay because Don King says George Bush is good.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.600]  Right.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.600]  And I get all my moral upbringing from Don King.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.600]  A convicted murderer.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.600]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.600]  So, I hadn't heard that one actually.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.600]  Yeah, it's new.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.600]  Good old Brad King.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.600]  And of course all over the country a rash of students getting expelled and suspended for removing the cameras in the potty.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600]  Oh.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600]  That's our big brother helping us.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600]  Wow.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.600]  I didn't know there were cameras in the potty.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.600]  Oh yeah, that's how they keep us safe.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.600]  I went to Hip Bar in London and they broadcast the camera in the men's room into the ladies room.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]  Really?
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]  Yeah.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]  It's very hip.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.600]  Well, we'll be right back.

[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.600]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.600]  Dean, there's a lot of different issues that you want to get into and I want to cover them.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.600]  But what's happening with the Patriot Act?
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:19.600]  What's happening with all this stuff about overt troops on the streets and gun confiscations in New Orleans?
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:26.600]  And then congressmen caught with hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen defense funds.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.600]  You talk about people waking up. What about inside the Hollywood structure? Are people starting to wake up there?
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.600]  They are. But again, Hollywood does run on fear.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:45.600]  So everybody, if you want to do a military script, it has to be pro-military or else you don't get the Pentagon giving you the tanks or the information and you don't get a consultant.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.600]  So your information looks way off.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:54.600]  Oh, I've seen that. And they'll refuse something that's 98% pro-military. It's got to be crackerjack corny worship.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.600]  Exactly. And I have friends who have written scripts that were anti-war, anti-military.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:12.600]  And their agents just say, you know what? It's a great script. I'm sure it'll be fabulous. We're not going to do it because we know that it's going to be blocked. We're not going to get funding.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:19.600]  These movies cost $20-60 million to make. That money doesn't come from some guy down the street out of his checkbook.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.600]  These come from huge venture capitalists that have huge corporate interests.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:31.600]  Well, Carlisle Group is buying into – they just bought one of the biggest theater chains in the country. They're trying to buy Columbia. They're buying TV stations.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:39.600]  That's right. And yet there's this independent film thing like John Greenwald doing outfoxed and the high cost, the low prices, the story of Walmart.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:51.600]  He's doing these really independent documentaries that are huge hits, but they're being distributed through channels like Straight to DVD.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.600]  Like he got DVD and theatrical at the same time, which is rare. Normally you show it in the theaters.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.600]  And that's good because you've got an audience, and that audience for alternative stuff is growing.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.600]  Yeah.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.600]  You were telling me about a Hollywood 9-11 nexus point with Alex Lightman?
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:11.600]  Yeah, he's writing a book about the connection between Al Qaeda and Hollywood.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:19.600]  And apparently, now I don't know if this is true, but this is what he told me at Dragon Con or at San Diego Comic Con last year,
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:32.600]  is that the senior officials called themselves Al Qaeda based on the translation of the Isaac Asimov book called The Club or The Group. Do you know this book?
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.600]  Yes.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:42.600]  Yeah, and that the Al Qaeda seniors are very much into science fiction, and they had three or four different plans going on.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:54.600]  And their watching of The Lone Gunmen was the one that made them go into the, you know, they were tied to the government to go and launch a plane strike into the World Trade Center.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.600]  Now, I don't know if that's true.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.600]  So he's saying he's getting this information. So you guys making the film made them do that?
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.600]  That's what he said.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.600]  But then, at the same time, the government would have had to watch and have drills, too, just for Al Qaeda.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.600]  Well, he's saying that the Al Qaeda is working with the government already, that they were funded and all of that.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.600]  I understand. I've got to interview him. So who is Alex Lightman?
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.600]  Alex Lightman. I've got his business card. I'll give it to you. Well, I'll give it to you e-mail.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:29.600]  He's an author, and he's been working on getting in high-level Al Qaeda reps for, he said, five or six years now on the connection between that and Hollywood.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:39.600]  Well, I know this. A lot of so-called Arab or Central Asian terrorist leaders are government agents, or it's more like global corporations fund them.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.600]  Then they go out and recruit 18-year-old kids that come from a dirt poor place and are devout Muslims and tell them,
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:52.600]  you're going to fight a big jihad, you're going to go do this, and they activate them to carry out bombings in Israel right when there's about to be a peace deal that the Likudniks don't want.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.600]  Exactly.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:00.600]  And then it's even been in the Jerusalem Post and other papers, and UPI has reported on it, that they go grab these 14-year-old kids that are throwing rocks.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.600]  Ten years later, they'll release them after torture, brainwashing, as their boys.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.600]  And then they caught them, quote, Al Qaeda squads that are Mossad Arabs that are controlled.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.600]  Right. And so, all again, this comes from a larger corporate structure.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:22.600]  It's about the money and more than, you know, I don't know, like you said, it's an illusion of left and right and all those sort of things.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:29.600]  We need to get people to reach out in these Arab ghettos and Palestinian ghettos.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:35.600]  And I know that actually they are waking up there that suicide bombing is not good, and most of the time it's got strings attached to it.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.600]  Absolutely. And as you said, they are waking up. And I see that, you know, everywhere I travel.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.600]  I was in Europe extensively over this last three or four months.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]  But that was fun.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.600]  That was a lot of fun, though my hard drive crashed in Holland.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.600]  So I just want to say I lost pretty much that whole documentary that we were shooting.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.600]  I have the original footage, but I had cut it to about an hour and a half.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600]  It was just on my hard drive.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.600]  Oh, man, you got to back that up.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.600]  I got to back that up. I did a backup five months earlier.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:09.600]  You know, I knew erotically, and I mean not that I'm some big filmmaker, but I knew erotically we upgraded backup every day.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.600]  And then we're hitting autosave for every execution.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.600]  See, now that's the kind of discipline I should learn from you guys.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.600]  Well, actually, I did stuff like you've done.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:17.600]  You have?
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.600]  You have?
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.600]  Well, Take Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.600]  That was five years ago, back on a three-quarter inch tape machine.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.600]  Ate the whole tape. I had to start over again.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.600]  Yeah, that was you talking about pulling your hair out.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.600]  Oh, my God. See, lessons that you learn.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600]  Yeah, lessons that you learn.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.600]  We'll be right back. Cover a bunch of other issues and take your calls.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600]  Stay with us.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.600]  Right on.
