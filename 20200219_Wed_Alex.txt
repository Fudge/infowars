[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  A lot of what I do here is take the obvious that there are only two genders.
[00:31.000 --> 00:38.000]  That communism is an absolute disaster except for the demons that run it.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  That Hillary Clinton is a lying criminal.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  It's Wednesday, February 19th, 2020. I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:49.000 --> 00:57.000]  And we are seeing a phenomenon all over the United States of Democrat Party candidates being confronted with the facts.
[00:57.000 --> 01:06.000]  And as I said a few months ago, back when Owen Schreuer simply stood up and confronted Jerry Nadler with the facts that they were the ones involved in treason.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  And that they were the ones that were butchering this country.
[01:10.000 --> 01:22.000]  And that if other people went out and did similar things, we could shut down the Democrats with the facts and the reality and take over all of their events and really put on display what criminals they are.
[01:22.000 --> 01:32.000]  And they'll fold like a tower of cards in a high wind.
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  Well, it's happened again. Bloomberg confronted for being an Epstein's little black book.
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  Stories up on infowars.com.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  This is the answer to taking these criminals on.
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  Democrat presidential candidate and former New York mayor was confronted by Dan Baddandi, host of Truth Radio Show.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  Listen to this broadcast note, Dan Well. Here it is.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  It's easy for me to make that commitment because I can't spell.
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  On the other hand, neither can Donald.
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  Seriously, this is a campaign for change, for sanity, for honesty, for inclusion.
[02:10.000 --> 02:27.000]  Why would your name have any black book? Hey, Michael, why would your name have any black book? How come your name has any black book? Just answer the question. Why would your name have any black book?
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  Why would your name have any black book?
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  I will talk to you outside, okay.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  Thank you.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  You're a cello! You are a cello!
[02:43.720 --> 02:46.920]  In order to honor a communist scum, you're not taking out guns, none of you.
[02:46.920 --> 02:49.560]  1776, we'll begin again if you take out guns.
[02:49.560 --> 02:50.760]  Shut the fuck up.
[02:50.760 --> 02:51.560]  Thank you for making me feel like I'm...
[02:51.560 --> 02:54.560]  You're at the disgrace of the Constitution, you global scum!
[02:56.120 --> 02:58.120]  You're a global scum!
[02:58.120 --> 03:00.120]  And we'll agree that people are going to stand up against you.
[03:00.120 --> 03:00.920]  You scum!
[03:00.920 --> 03:02.920]  Thank you, I appreciate your thoughts.
[03:02.920 --> 03:03.560]  Thanks.
[03:03.560 --> 03:05.160]  Move. Now.
[03:05.160 --> 03:07.160]  We are not going to allow you to take our Second Amendment.
[03:07.160 --> 03:08.040]  Nobody's going to...
[03:08.040 --> 03:10.040]  Trump 2020!
[03:10.040 --> 03:12.040]  Trump 2020!
[03:12.040 --> 03:14.040]  You're not taking out guns!
[03:14.040 --> 03:16.040]  You're global scum!
[03:16.040 --> 03:18.040]  1776, we'll begin again!
[03:24.040 --> 03:26.040]  That's the Communist of the FPV.
[03:28.040 --> 03:30.040]  I have a free speech on the time of the report.
[03:30.040 --> 03:32.040]  It's good to hear.
[03:32.040 --> 03:34.040]  Take your hands off.
[03:34.040 --> 03:38.040]  Let's go.
[03:38.040 --> 03:40.040]  Disorder in public.
[03:54.040 --> 03:58.040]  Michael Bloomberg, you're a criminal to the Constitution.
[03:58.040 --> 04:00.040]  Oh, look at this guy.
[04:00.040 --> 04:02.040]  He puts on some dirty Jordans and he thinks he's cool.
[04:02.040 --> 04:04.040]  He's hanging around with the known child's rapist.
[04:04.040 --> 04:06.040]  Yeah, you, turn around.
[04:06.040 --> 04:08.040]  You think you can try to put on Jordans and be down with the culture
[04:08.040 --> 04:10.040]  and you don't match?
[04:10.040 --> 04:12.040]  You're a sellout pedophile protector.
[04:12.040 --> 04:14.040]  How dare you?
[04:14.040 --> 04:16.040]  The Second Amendment will not be your friend.
[04:16.040 --> 04:18.040]  You don't have enough forces to disarm the American people.
[04:18.040 --> 04:20.040]  1776, we'll begin again
[04:20.040 --> 04:22.040]  if you try to disarm us.
[04:22.040 --> 04:24.040]  Michael Bloomberg flew around the world
[04:24.040 --> 04:26.040]  with known child's rapist Jeffrey F.D.
[04:28.040 --> 04:30.040]  He's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,
[04:30.040 --> 04:32.040]  a known white nationalist
[04:32.040 --> 04:34.040]  and your American establishment.
[04:34.040 --> 04:36.040]  He wants to take our human freedom the right way.
[04:36.040 --> 04:38.040]  He said he wants to change the Constitution
[04:38.040 --> 04:40.040]  that many women have given their blood
[04:40.040 --> 04:42.040]  but his tears for.
[04:42.040 --> 04:44.040]  You are a traitor to the country, Michael Bloomberg.
[04:44.040 --> 04:46.040]  Rob, you're a fucking sellout, Bloomberg.
[04:46.040 --> 04:48.040]  You're a real protector.
[04:48.040 --> 04:50.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's activism like this
[04:50.040 --> 04:52.040]  that will bring the tyrants to their knees
[04:52.040 --> 04:54.040]  with the right facts.
[04:54.040 --> 05:00.040]  At the end of World War II,
[05:00.040 --> 05:02.040]  Adolf Hitler had discredited
[05:02.040 --> 05:04.040]  the eugenics and
[05:04.040 --> 05:06.040]  world population control organizations.
[05:06.040 --> 05:08.040]  They openly had meetings
[05:08.040 --> 05:10.040]  and led by Julian Huxley,
[05:10.040 --> 05:12.040]  Aldous Huxley's brother,
[05:12.040 --> 05:14.040]  decided to repackage themselves
[05:14.040 --> 05:16.040]  as transhumanists.
[05:16.040 --> 05:18.040]  Now in the year 2020
[05:18.040 --> 05:20.040]  to set the precedent
[05:20.040 --> 05:22.040]  that people can be turned into cyborgs
[05:22.040 --> 05:24.040]  that robots can be given rights,
[05:24.040 --> 05:26.040]  you name it,
[05:26.040 --> 05:28.040]  they are intimidating and arresting people
[05:28.040 --> 05:30.040]  all over the world
[05:30.040 --> 05:32.040]  who simply misgender someone.
[05:32.040 --> 05:34.040]  So the ultimate crime
[05:34.040 --> 05:36.040]  will be even asking
[05:36.040 --> 05:38.040]  what someone is
[05:38.040 --> 05:40.040]  if you can't even tell
[05:40.040 --> 05:42.040]  what they are.
[05:42.040 --> 05:44.040]  This is the ultimate Kafka-esque mind control
[05:44.040 --> 05:46.040]  and there's several big articles up on InfoWars.com
[05:46.040 --> 05:48.040]  that break this down.
[05:48.040 --> 05:50.040]  UK keen find at her house arrest
[05:50.040 --> 05:52.040]  asking trans police officers
[05:52.040 --> 05:54.040]  gender, UK mother,
[05:54.040 --> 05:56.040]  spare jail for misgendering trans woman
[05:56.040 --> 06:22.040]  to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[06:22.040 --> 06:24.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, very exciting things
[06:24.040 --> 06:26.040]  and the world populist are waking up
[06:26.040 --> 06:28.040]  and are taking action
[06:28.040 --> 06:30.040]  and are speaking out
[06:30.040 --> 06:32.040]  and are confronting
[06:32.040 --> 06:34.040]  these corrupt politicians
[06:34.040 --> 06:36.040]  to their faces.
[06:36.040 --> 06:38.040]  Now there's a video that's posted
[06:38.040 --> 06:40.040]  right now to InfoWars.com
[06:40.040 --> 06:42.040]  for NationalFile.com
[06:42.040 --> 06:44.040]  Bloomberg confronted
[06:44.040 --> 06:46.040]  for being an Epstein's
[06:46.040 --> 06:48.040]  little black book.
[06:48.040 --> 06:50.040]  Now let's talk about
[06:50.040 --> 06:52.040]  the fact that
[06:52.040 --> 06:54.040]  Hillary Rodham Clinton
[06:54.040 --> 06:56.040]  was running
[06:56.040 --> 06:58.040]  Jeffrey Epstein
[06:58.040 --> 07:00.040]  and was extremely close to Bloomberg
[07:00.040 --> 07:02.040]  and you've obviously seen how they're now
[07:02.040 --> 07:04.040]  talking about
[07:04.040 --> 07:06.040]  running together
[07:06.040 --> 07:08.040]  with Hillary as the VP.
[07:08.040 --> 07:10.040]  That's why Hillary and Bill are so powerful
[07:10.040 --> 07:12.040]  as they were in control of those
[07:12.040 --> 07:14.040]  pedophilia blackmail ranks
[07:14.040 --> 07:16.040]  and that's now, of course, mainstream news.
[07:16.040 --> 07:18.040]  We've been exposing it for more than two decades.
[07:18.040 --> 07:20.040]  And so whether Hillary
[07:20.040 --> 07:22.040]  goes to New York
[07:22.040 --> 07:24.040]  or whether she goes to LA
[07:24.040 --> 07:26.040]  or whether she goes to Austin, Texas
[07:26.040 --> 07:28.040]  she is confronted with the Epstein
[07:28.040 --> 07:30.040]  information.
[07:30.040 --> 07:32.040]  Many times there are people outside protesting.
[07:32.040 --> 07:34.040]  There are people inside protesting.
[07:34.040 --> 07:36.040]  Bill Clinton everywhere he goes
[07:36.040 --> 07:38.040]  is confronted with. Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[07:38.040 --> 07:40.040]  They were trying to project that on the Trump
[07:40.040 --> 07:42.040]  four years ago
[07:42.040 --> 07:44.040]  but they failed because InfoWars listeners
[07:44.040 --> 07:46.040]  went and screamed
[07:46.040 --> 07:48.040]  Bill Clinton is a rapist. He settled three rapes.
[07:48.040 --> 07:50.040]  Hillary helped cover it up.
[07:50.040 --> 07:52.040]  And that's why, of course, we've been targeted
[07:52.040 --> 07:54.040]  by Hillary was for taking her on
[07:54.040 --> 07:56.040]  at point blank range.
[07:56.040 --> 07:58.040]  I personally am very blessed to even be alive
[07:58.040 --> 08:00.040]  but I just put it in God's hands and thanks to your prayers
[08:00.040 --> 08:02.040]  we are still here.
[08:02.040 --> 08:04.040]  We've put together some powerful compilations
[08:04.040 --> 08:06.040]  of that.
[08:06.040 --> 08:08.040]  And of Owen confronting Nadler
[08:08.040 --> 08:10.040]  in Congress and all these Democrats
[08:10.040 --> 08:12.040]  being confronted around the country
[08:12.040 --> 08:14.040]  with their backgrounds, with their corruption.
[08:14.040 --> 08:16.040]  We don't go try to shut them down
[08:16.040 --> 08:18.040]  and just do and stop their events.
[08:18.040 --> 08:20.040]  We go and eloquently
[08:20.040 --> 08:22.040]  lay out the facts
[08:22.040 --> 08:24.040]  and it totally
[08:24.040 --> 08:26.040]  takes over their events in a good way
[08:26.040 --> 08:28.040]  and we're all over the news
[08:28.040 --> 08:30.040]  all over TV and all over print
[08:30.040 --> 08:32.040]  and there's no way they can shut it down
[08:32.040 --> 08:34.040]  and the minions of Hillary
[08:34.040 --> 08:36.040]  and the minions of
[08:36.040 --> 08:38.040]  Bill and the minions of Bloomberg
[08:38.040 --> 08:40.040]  don't know what
[08:40.040 --> 08:42.040]  to do.
[08:42.040 --> 08:44.040]  They don't know how to respond
[08:44.040 --> 08:46.040]  to the facts because it's not just
[08:46.040 --> 08:48.040]  you're a racist FU
[08:48.040 --> 08:50.040]  you need to be put in prison
[08:50.040 --> 08:52.040]  stuff like that.
[08:52.040 --> 08:54.040]  Like the left does trying to physically shut down the events
[08:54.040 --> 08:56.040]  we shut down their propaganda
[08:56.040 --> 08:58.040]  with truth and they're speechless
[08:58.040 --> 09:00.040]  and don't know what to say.
[09:00.040 --> 09:02.040]  So we're not censoring them
[09:02.040 --> 09:04.040]  we're going and having our voices
[09:04.040 --> 09:06.040]  heard just like Owen did
[09:06.040 --> 09:08.040]  saying you're treasonous
[09:08.040 --> 09:10.040]  you're the traitor not Trump
[09:10.040 --> 09:12.040]  because Nadler was saying that the president was
[09:12.040 --> 09:14.040]  a traitor. The globalists want
[09:14.040 --> 09:16.040]  America to be dead
[09:16.040 --> 09:18.040]  and shoveled into its grave.
[09:18.040 --> 09:20.040]  They want America to be the past
[09:20.040 --> 09:22.040]  and not to be reborn as
[09:22.040 --> 09:24.040]  any nation must be to survive
[09:24.040 --> 09:26.040]  more than 200 years but we're here
[09:26.040 --> 09:28.040]  thanks to you assuring that happens.
[09:28.040 --> 09:30.040]  So I'm going to play Bill Clinton
[09:30.040 --> 09:32.040]  being confronted as a rapist
[09:32.040 --> 09:34.040]  just a few of the hundreds of times
[09:34.040 --> 09:36.040]  sponsored by M4s brought to you by our listeners
[09:36.040 --> 09:38.040]  taking action and then we're going to show Hillary
[09:38.040 --> 09:40.040]  three or four months ago being confronted in Austin
[09:40.040 --> 09:42.040]  and then we're going to show
[09:42.040 --> 09:44.040]  Bloomberg being confronted a few days ago
[09:44.040 --> 09:46.040]  now breaking at infowars.com
[09:46.040 --> 09:48.040]  on the Epstein connection
[09:48.040 --> 09:50.040]  and then we're going to show Owen Schreuer
[09:50.040 --> 09:52.040]  and of course you know what he did because this is
[09:52.040 --> 09:54.040]  the answer and this is how we
[09:54.040 --> 09:56.040]  take them on and this is how we stop
[09:56.040 --> 09:58.040]  the censorship is by activism
[09:58.040 --> 10:00.040]  in the third dimension. Here is
[10:00.040 --> 10:02.040]  Bill Clinton being shut down four years ago.
[10:02.040 --> 10:10.040]  Oh my God!
[10:10.040 --> 10:12.040]  Adoptable dogs. Every year
[10:12.040 --> 10:14.040]  the Best Friends Animal Society
[10:14.040 --> 10:16.040]  helps cats and dogs
[10:16.040 --> 10:18.040]  who are stuck in animal shelters.
[10:18.040 --> 10:20.040]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[10:20.040 --> 10:22.040]  We've got him.
[10:22.040 --> 10:24.040]  I think one of the kind of the things
[10:24.040 --> 10:26.040]  that we really need to be looking at
[10:26.040 --> 10:28.040]  in this debate is that Bill Clinton
[10:28.040 --> 10:30.040]  is a rapist infowars.com
[10:30.040 --> 10:32.040]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[10:32.040 --> 10:34.040]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[10:34.040 --> 10:36.040]  I got this Hillary for prison t-shirt
[10:36.040 --> 10:38.040]  and I just want everyone to know about this
[10:38.040 --> 10:40.040]  big presidential campaign
[10:40.040 --> 10:42.040]  that Bill Clinton is a rapist
[10:42.040 --> 10:44.040]  infowars.com
[10:44.040 --> 10:46.040]  Thank you very much Terrence.
[10:46.040 --> 10:48.040]  How can we make sure everybody gets a chance
[10:48.040 --> 10:50.040]  to participate?
[10:50.040 --> 10:52.040]  How can we help families succeed
[10:52.040 --> 10:54.040]  in the most important job in society
[10:54.040 --> 10:56.040]  raising children?
[10:56.040 --> 10:58.040]  How can we live together
[10:58.040 --> 11:00.040]  when Bill Clinton doesn't age?
[11:00.040 --> 11:02.040]  No, he doesn't. He looks great.
[11:02.040 --> 11:04.040]  We're all going to rickroll.
[11:04.040 --> 11:06.040]  Exactly.
[11:06.040 --> 11:08.040]  You're out of here.
[11:08.040 --> 11:10.040]  What about Juanita Broderick?
[11:10.040 --> 11:12.040]  Did you write about her in your book?
[11:12.040 --> 11:14.040]  You've said your piece.
[11:14.040 --> 11:16.040]  Did you write about Paula Jones in your book?
[11:16.040 --> 11:18.040]  You've said your piece.
[11:18.040 --> 11:20.040]  Alex Jones is right about this woman.
[11:20.040 --> 11:22.040]  Juanita Broderick.
[11:22.040 --> 11:24.040]  Is she in the book?
[11:24.040 --> 11:26.040]  Is Juanita Broderick in her book?
[11:26.040 --> 11:28.040]  Is Paula Jones in her book?
[11:28.040 --> 11:30.040]  Paula Jones.
[11:30.040 --> 11:32.040]  Look her up.
[11:34.040 --> 11:36.040]  It's easy for me to make
[11:36.040 --> 11:38.040]  that commitment because I can't spell
[11:38.040 --> 11:40.040]  on the other
[11:40.040 --> 11:42.040]  and neither can Donald.
[11:42.040 --> 11:44.040]  Seriously, this is a campaign
[11:44.040 --> 11:46.040]  for change.
[11:46.040 --> 11:48.040]  For sanity, for honesty,
[11:48.040 --> 11:50.040]  for inclusion.
[11:50.040 --> 11:52.040]  Hey Michael, how come your name is
[11:52.040 --> 11:54.040]  Black Book?
[11:54.040 --> 11:56.040]  Look, how come your name is
[11:56.040 --> 11:58.040]  Black Book? Just answer the question.
[11:58.040 --> 12:00.040]  Why would you name Black Book?
[12:00.040 --> 12:02.040]  No.
[12:02.040 --> 12:04.040]  No.
[12:04.040 --> 12:06.040]  No.
[12:06.040 --> 12:08.040]  No.
[12:08.040 --> 12:10.040]  Why would you name Black Book?
[12:10.040 --> 12:12.040]  I will talk to you outside, okay?
[12:12.040 --> 12:14.040]  No.
[12:14.040 --> 12:16.040]  Thank you.
[12:16.040 --> 12:18.040]  You are a savior.
[12:18.040 --> 12:20.040]  You are a seller.
[12:20.040 --> 12:22.040]  You're a real man.
[12:22.040 --> 12:24.040]  You know that you're a communist scum.
[12:24.040 --> 12:26.040]  You're not taking out guns. None of you.
[12:26.040 --> 12:28.040]  1776, we'll begin again if you take our guns.
[12:28.040 --> 12:30.040]  Shut the fuck up.
[12:30.040 --> 12:32.040]  Thank you for making me feel like a man.
[12:32.040 --> 12:34.040]  You're a global scum.
[12:34.040 --> 12:36.040]  You're a global scum.
[12:36.040 --> 12:38.040]  And we'll bring the people
[12:38.040 --> 12:40.040]  to stand up again if you do.
[12:40.040 --> 12:42.040]  Thank you. I appreciate your thoughts.
[12:42.040 --> 12:44.040]  Thanks.
[12:44.040 --> 12:46.040]  We are not going to allow you to take our second amendment.
[12:46.040 --> 12:48.040]  Did you see Trump
[12:48.040 --> 12:50.040]  2020?
[12:50.040 --> 12:52.040]  Trump 2020.
[12:52.040 --> 12:54.040]  You're not taking out guns. You're global scum.
[12:54.040 --> 12:56.040]  Here is how
[12:56.040 --> 12:58.040]  the committee will proceed for this hearing.
[12:58.040 --> 13:00.040]  I will make an opening statement,
[13:00.040 --> 13:02.040]  and then I will recognize the ranking member
[13:02.040 --> 13:04.040]  for an opening statement.
[13:04.040 --> 13:06.040]  After that, we will hear two sets of presentations.
[13:06.040 --> 13:08.040]  We will hear
[13:08.040 --> 13:10.040]  30-minute opening arguments
[13:10.040 --> 13:12.040]  from councils for the majority and the minority
[13:12.040 --> 13:14.040]  of this committee.
[13:14.040 --> 13:20.040]  You are committing treason.
[13:20.040 --> 13:22.040]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party
[13:22.040 --> 13:24.040]  are committing treason against this country.
[13:24.040 --> 13:26.040]  And you can kick me out,
[13:26.040 --> 13:28.040]  but he's the one committing crimes.
[13:28.040 --> 13:30.040]  You are, Jerry Nadler.
[13:30.040 --> 13:32.040]  You're the one committing treason.
[13:32.040 --> 13:34.040]  America's done with this.
[13:34.040 --> 13:36.040]  America's sent to the trees
[13:36.040 --> 13:38.040]  and committed by Democrat Party.
[13:38.040 --> 13:40.040]  They're not going to sit here
[13:40.040 --> 13:42.040]  and watch them run in the streets.
[13:42.040 --> 13:44.040]  We voted for Donald Trump,
[13:44.040 --> 13:46.040]  and their people removed him because they don't like him.
[13:46.040 --> 13:48.040]  America's are sent to the trees and stand up.
[13:48.040 --> 13:50.040]  They're sent to the Democrats' trees.
[13:50.040 --> 13:52.040]  We know who committed the crimes,
[13:52.040 --> 13:54.040]  and it wasn't Trump.
[13:54.040 --> 13:56.040]  Trump is innocent.
[14:00.040 --> 14:02.040]  The committee will come to order.
[14:02.040 --> 14:04.040]  Obviously, I shouldn't have to remind
[14:04.040 --> 14:06.040]  everyone present
[14:06.040 --> 14:08.040]  that the audience is here
[14:08.040 --> 14:10.040]  to observe,
[14:10.040 --> 14:12.040]  but not to demonstrate,
[14:12.040 --> 14:14.040]  not to indicate agreement or disagreement
[14:14.040 --> 14:16.040]  with any witness or with any
[14:16.040 --> 14:18.040]  member of the committee.
[14:18.040 --> 14:20.040]  Yeah, I'm Owen Schreuer from infowords.com.
[14:20.040 --> 14:22.040]  What's your name?
[14:22.040 --> 14:24.040]  Owen Schreuer.
[14:24.040 --> 14:26.040]  I think it's ironic I'm being pulled out of here
[14:26.040 --> 14:28.040]  when the Democrats are the ones committing crimes.
[14:28.040 --> 14:30.040]  Thank you.
[14:32.040 --> 14:34.040]  I'm being arrested right now
[14:34.040 --> 14:36.040]  for disruption of Congress.
[14:36.040 --> 14:38.040]  I'm a criminal for my first amendment rights.
[14:38.040 --> 14:40.040]  Thank you, folks.
[14:46.040 --> 14:48.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what it's all about.
[14:48.040 --> 14:50.040]  You want to take your country back 1776,
[14:50.040 --> 14:52.040]  part two,
[14:52.040 --> 14:54.040]  you do it in an information war.
[14:54.040 --> 14:56.040]  It's that simple.
[14:56.040 --> 14:58.040]  And it's all you've got to go out and do.
[14:58.040 --> 15:00.040]  You don't have to go charge machine gun nest
[15:00.040 --> 15:02.040]  like veterans have done to defend the country.
[15:02.040 --> 15:04.040]  This is the nation under globalist attack,
[15:04.040 --> 15:06.040]  and they're openly involved
[15:06.040 --> 15:08.040]  in pedophile rings and blackmail,
[15:08.040 --> 15:10.040]  and they're openly involved in incredible corruption.
[15:10.040 --> 15:12.040]  And we've got
[15:12.040 --> 15:14.040]  people like Bloomberg
[15:14.040 --> 15:16.040]  with all of his corruption.
[15:16.040 --> 15:18.040]  He supports death panels.
[15:18.040 --> 15:20.040]  He tells his employees to get abortions on record,
[15:20.040 --> 15:22.040]  so he makes more money.
[15:24.040 --> 15:26.040]  He
[15:26.040 --> 15:28.040]  is involved, you know,
[15:28.040 --> 15:30.040]  saying that farmers are stupid and suck.
[15:30.040 --> 15:32.040]  These are monsters.
[15:32.040 --> 15:34.040]  And all their money can't change
[15:34.040 --> 15:36.040]  the fact that they're monsters.
[15:36.040 --> 15:38.040]  So when we come back,
[15:38.040 --> 15:40.040]  we're going to talk about
[15:40.040 --> 15:42.040]  how we take it to the enemy
[15:42.040 --> 15:44.040]  and how we make sure it's their system that is the past,
[15:44.040 --> 15:46.040]  their system that's shoveled
[15:46.040 --> 15:48.040]  into its grave politically and not our Republic.
[15:48.040 --> 15:50.040]  We've got to find our heart,
[15:50.040 --> 15:52.040]  our soul, our mind, our memories again,
[15:52.040 --> 15:54.040]  and rediscover who we are,
[15:54.040 --> 15:56.040]  not goldfish, but humans.
[15:56.040 --> 15:58.040]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[15:58.040 --> 16:00.040]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[16:00.040 --> 16:02.040]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:02.040 --> 16:04.040]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:04.040 --> 16:06.040]  I beat the IRS then,
[16:06.040 --> 16:08.040]  and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:08.040 --> 16:10.040]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[16:10.040 --> 16:12.040]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[16:12.040 --> 16:14.040]  they thought might never be solved.
[16:14.040 --> 16:16.040]  I can help you, too.
[16:16.040 --> 16:18.040]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[16:18.040 --> 16:20.040]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:20.040 --> 16:22.040]  Call 834, no tax,
[16:22.040 --> 16:24.040]  or go to my website,

[16:28.040 --> 16:30.040]  Danpilla.com.
[16:30.040 --> 16:32.040]  Where you can't pay,
[16:32.040 --> 16:34.040]  or you can't pay with tax.
[16:34.040 --> 16:36.040]  Tell us how the company got to the next day
[16:36.040 --> 16:38.040]  of when it was already McDonald's time.
[16:38.040 --> 16:40.040]  Tell us when it was already McDonald's time.
[16:40.040 --> 16:42.040]  Tell us when it was already McDonald's time.
[16:42.040 --> 16:44.040]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there
[16:44.040 --> 16:46.040]  who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:46.040 --> 16:48.040]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents
[16:48.040 --> 16:50.040]  and licensed tax experts
[16:50.040 --> 16:52.040]  removed wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[16:52.040 --> 16:54.040]  We even have reduced the total debt
[16:54.040 --> 16:56.040]  some of our clients were required to pay
[16:56.040 --> 16:58.040]  through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:58.040 --> 17:02.600]  didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[17:02.600 --> 17:07.720]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot
[17:07.720 --> 17:13.240]  less, call OMGTACS right now for a free tax-saving consultation.

[19:21.360 --> 19:42.560]  It's brilliant.
[19:42.560 --> 19:49.600]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon.
[19:49.600 --> 19:52.560]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[19:52.560 --> 19:55.440]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[19:55.440 --> 20:01.440]  Silence.
[20:01.440 --> 20:14.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:14.720 --> 20:44.560]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:44.560 --> 20:45.520]  It's a processing.
[20:45.520 --> 20:49.280]  You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, it comes to corn.
[20:49.280 --> 21:03.200]  You could learn that.
[21:03.200 --> 21:06.000]  Take you now to Chicago and Paul Harvey.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.440]  And on the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said,
[21:11.440 --> 21:16.080]  I need a caretaker, so God made a farmer.
[21:16.080 --> 21:20.480]  God said, I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, milk cows work all day in the fields,
[21:20.480 --> 21:25.040]  milk cows again, eat supper, then go to town and stay past midnight at a meeting of a school board,
[21:25.040 --> 21:27.520]  so God made a farmer.
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.560]  God said, I need somebody willing to sit up all night with a newborn coat and watch it die,
[21:33.520 --> 21:38.480]  and dry his eyes and say, maybe next year, I need somebody who can shave an axe,
[21:38.480 --> 21:42.480]  handbook from a persimmon sprout, shoo a horse with a hunk of car tire,
[21:42.480 --> 21:45.280]  who can make harness out of hay, wire feed sacks, and shoe scraps,
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.920]  who planting time and harvest season will finish his 40 hour a week by Tuesday noon,
[21:49.920 --> 21:54.000]  and then paint him from tractor back, put in another 72 hours, so God made a farmer.
[21:55.200 --> 21:59.440]  God said, I need somebody strong enough to clear trees and heave bales,
[21:59.440 --> 22:03.520]  yet gentle enough to yin lambs and wean pigs and tend to pink comb bullets,
[22:03.520 --> 22:07.280]  who will stop his mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a metal arc,
[22:07.280 --> 22:08.480]  so God made a farmer.
[22:09.680 --> 22:13.200]  It had to be somebody who'd plow deep and straight and not cut corners,
[22:13.200 --> 22:17.360]  somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed, and break and disc and plow and plant and
[22:17.360 --> 22:20.880]  tie the fleece and strain the milk, somebody who'd lay the family together
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.040]  with the soft, strong bonds of sharing, who would laugh and then sigh,
[22:26.000 --> 22:32.640]  and then reply with smiling eyes when his son says that he wants to spend his life
[22:32.640 --> 22:36.880]  doing what dad does, so God made a farmer.
[23:03.600 --> 23:08.880]  He's coming this weekend, and a criminal, and that's just a whole other day.
[23:09.840 --> 23:12.880]  The power guy is a white and mighty bird.
[23:13.600 --> 23:16.720]  America will never back down.
[23:17.760 --> 23:22.240]  The hammer in 1984 is evidence of his death.
[23:23.360 --> 23:29.200]  If the horse lives, and if the horse is fighting back,
[23:29.200 --> 23:37.200]  the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[23:37.200 --> 23:41.200]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of the American people.
[23:41.200 --> 23:47.200]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of America.
[23:49.200 --> 23:55.200]  Hillary Clinton is openly calling for censorship of all takers and nationalists.
[23:55.200 --> 24:00.640]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal. She's failed. She's still our national.
[24:00.640 --> 24:04.720]  And it's time to calm. Hillary Clinton is a criminal.
[24:05.760 --> 24:09.600]  Hillary Clinton will never silence the American people.
[24:10.560 --> 24:15.520]  America is awake. America knows what's happening.
[24:15.520 --> 24:19.200]  And infohours.com is exposing it.
[24:19.200 --> 24:25.200]  America is back. America is back.
[24:25.200 --> 24:29.200]  America is back.
[24:29.200 --> 24:33.200]  America is back.
[24:33.200 --> 24:37.200]  The marvelous criminal represented by the Democratic Party.
[24:37.200 --> 24:39.200]  By Kimmel. By Kimmel.
[24:39.200 --> 24:41.200]  By Kimmel.
[24:41.200 --> 24:43.200]  By Kimmel.
[24:43.200 --> 24:45.200]  By Kimmel.
[24:45.200 --> 24:47.200]  By Kimmel.
[24:47.200 --> 24:53.200]  Democratic Party's attempted criminal takeover of America is failing.
[24:53.200 --> 25:02.200]  Your dog Hillary Clinton is a war criminal and is involved in child sex trafficking out of dating.
[25:02.200 --> 25:10.200]  Hillary Clinton is involved with Jeffrey Epstein. Hillary Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile aircraft.
[25:10.200 --> 25:19.200]  Democrats are a authoritarian anti-American criminal that have failed to silence our speech.
[25:19.200 --> 25:27.200]  Big Tech and the Chicombs and Hillary have failed to silence America's speech.
[25:27.200 --> 25:38.200]  America is back. America is back. America is back. America is back. America is back.
[25:38.200 --> 25:43.200]  Hillary Clinton worked with a child by Esther Jeffrey Epstein.
[25:43.200 --> 25:49.200]  Hillary Clinton wants to subsidize our children. Hillary Clinton is a war criminal.
[25:49.200 --> 25:55.200]  Hillary Clinton, if you can't even walk, are going down.
[25:55.200 --> 26:04.200]  Hillary Clinton is a failure. Your Democratic Party is collapsing. Every city you control is collapsing into hell.
[26:04.200 --> 26:08.200]  Everyone is running from the Democrats and their meddling.
[26:08.200 --> 26:15.200]  Your so-called power cut, the Democratic Party that found it, the KKK is going down.
[26:15.200 --> 26:21.200]  The Democrats are KKK. The Democrats are KKK.
[26:21.200 --> 26:28.200]  The Democrats are KKK. The Democrats are KKK. The Democrats are KKK.
[26:28.200 --> 26:35.200]  And look, they are holding different crimes against KKK. Down with the KKK. Down with the sugar in his weight.
[26:35.200 --> 26:44.200]  I say down with the KKK. And then she says, no. Down with the KKK and Hillary. Down with the KKK and Hillary.
[26:44.200 --> 26:47.200]  Down with the Democrats that founded the KKK.
[26:48.100 --> 26:51.100]  Down with the Democrats that founded the KKK.
[26:51.500 --> 26:54.100]  Down with the Democrats that founded the KKK.
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.500]  Man, not many of them.
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.000]  There's a problem.
[27:05.900 --> 27:07.000]  Here's the problem!
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.100]  The real threat is the reverse!
[27:09.100 --> 27:14.100]  Infowars.com!
[27:14.100 --> 27:16.100]  Adoptable dogs every year.
[27:16.100 --> 27:19.100]  The Best Friends Animal Society helps cats
[27:19.100 --> 27:22.100]  and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters.
[27:22.100 --> 27:24.100]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[27:27.100 --> 27:29.100]  I think one of the kind of the things that
[27:29.100 --> 27:31.100]  we really need to be looking at in this debate
[27:31.100 --> 27:33.100]  is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[27:33.100 --> 27:35.100]  Infowars.com. Infowars.com.
[27:35.100 --> 27:37.100]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[27:37.100 --> 27:38.100]  Alright. Bill Clinton.
[27:38.100 --> 27:40.100]  And I got this Hillary for prison t-shirt
[27:40.100 --> 27:43.100]  and I just want everyone to know about this big presidential campaign
[27:43.100 --> 27:46.100]  that Bill Clinton is a rapist. Infowars.com.
[27:47.100 --> 27:49.100]  Okay. Thank you very much, Terrence.
[28:03.100 --> 28:04.100]  He doesn't age.
[28:04.100 --> 28:05.100]  No, he doesn't. He looks great.
[28:05.100 --> 28:07.100]  We're all going to Rick Rolls.
[28:07.100 --> 28:08.100]  Exactly.
[28:10.100 --> 28:11.100]  Alright, folks.
[28:11.100 --> 28:14.100]  Again, I saw this morning the video
[28:14.100 --> 28:16.100]  up on Infowars.com.
[28:16.100 --> 28:18.100]  Bloomberg confronted for being
[28:18.100 --> 28:20.100]  in Epstein's Little Black Book
[28:20.100 --> 28:22.100]  and he's all part of that whole network with the Clintons.
[28:23.100 --> 28:27.100]  And I just, again, knew that if we take action
[28:27.100 --> 28:30.100]  and we go to their events, we confront them with the facts
[28:30.100 --> 28:32.100]  that it's over for the deep state.
[28:32.100 --> 28:35.100]  They all are a pack of sick filth.
[28:35.100 --> 28:37.100]  And just the understanding of that
[28:37.100 --> 28:39.100]  right before the show began
[28:39.100 --> 28:41.100]  made me explode victory and energy
[28:41.100 --> 28:44.100]  to the point of I was like a race car engine
[28:44.100 --> 28:47.100]  revving to, you know, 10,000 RPMs,
[28:47.100 --> 28:50.100]  11,000 RPMs and blowing a rod.
[28:50.100 --> 28:52.100]  Because I'm not a psychopath. I care.
[28:52.100 --> 29:03.100]  I'm not a sociopath. I'm the opposite.
[29:23.100 --> 29:25.100]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.100 --> 29:27.100]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[29:27.100 --> 29:29.100]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:29.100 --> 29:31.100]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:31.100 --> 29:34.100]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[29:34.100 --> 29:37.100]  should be using this product as a preventative
[29:37.100 --> 29:58.100]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:58.100 --> 30:02.100]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election
[30:02.100 --> 30:05.100]  and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[30:05.100 --> 30:07.100]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy.
[30:07.100 --> 30:08.100]  They're trying to start wars.
[30:08.100 --> 30:10.100]  They're trying to overthrow the president.
[30:10.100 --> 30:12.100]  They're trying to silence free speech.
[30:12.100 --> 30:14.100]  They're trying to trigger riots in the streets,
[30:14.100 --> 30:16.100]  but everything they do is blowing up in their face.
[30:16.100 --> 30:19.100]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved,
[30:19.100 --> 30:22.100]  keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies,
[30:22.100 --> 30:25.100]  and we have to be prepared in case things go south.
[30:25.100 --> 30:28.100]  That's why it's so critical to go to infowarstore.com

[30:50.100 --> 30:52.100]  Every point of the compass is covered.
[30:52.100 --> 30:55.100]  The only way we can be defeated is if you don't take action.

[30:59.100 --> 31:04.100]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[31:04.100 --> 31:07.100]  There are many reasons why we need to think about
[31:07.100 --> 31:09.100]  what is really in the air around us.
[31:09.100 --> 31:11.100]  We may not be able to stop breathing,
[31:11.100 --> 31:13.100]  but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[31:13.100 --> 31:17.100]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system
[31:17.100 --> 31:20.100]  is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous
[31:20.100 --> 31:22.100]  toxins and viruses in the air.

[31:27.100 --> 31:29.100]  to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[31:29.100 --> 31:33.100]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars,
[31:33.100 --> 31:35.100]  but the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification
[31:35.100 --> 31:38.100]  is the best and most affordable bar none.

[32:24.100 --> 32:26.100]  You get fined under house arrest
[32:26.100 --> 32:28.100]  for asking trans police officers gender,
[32:28.100 --> 32:30.100]  and it hurt their feelings.
[32:30.100 --> 32:34.100]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman
[32:34.100 --> 32:37.100]  ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine
[32:37.100 --> 32:42.100]  because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[32:42.100 --> 32:44.100]  That's the thought police.
[32:44.100 --> 32:46.100]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason,
[32:46.100 --> 32:49.100]  you get fined and you go to jail.
[32:49.100 --> 32:50.100]  This is tyranny.
[32:50.100 --> 32:52.100]  These people are bullies, and it's sick,
[32:52.100 --> 32:56.100]  and it's evil, and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[32:56.100 --> 32:58.100]  Resist it. Speak out against it.
[32:58.100 --> 33:20.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:29.100 --> 33:36.100]  You know, I work out to the soundtrack of The Bad and the Ugly,
[33:36.100 --> 33:39.100]  and I probably shouldn't do it
[33:39.100 --> 33:42.100]  because it gets me very focused and very emotional
[33:42.100 --> 33:44.100]  when that blood's pouring to my brain,
[33:44.100 --> 33:47.100]  and I know how to defeat the globalist
[33:47.100 --> 33:50.100]  because any time I've been able to carry out
[33:50.100 --> 33:53.100]  anything that we've got planned, it actually happens.
[33:53.100 --> 33:57.100]  The problem is, you've got to punch through.
[33:57.100 --> 34:01.100]  And there's nothing in the universe
[34:01.100 --> 34:04.100]  more frustrating than knowing you've got the birthright,
[34:04.100 --> 34:06.100]  you've got the answers, you've got the will,
[34:06.100 --> 34:09.100]  you've got the force and the ability to win
[34:09.100 --> 34:11.100]  and defeat these evil people
[34:11.100 --> 34:13.100]  and to not be able to carry it out.
[34:13.100 --> 34:16.100]  There's nothing like having success,
[34:16.100 --> 34:18.100]  incredible success,
[34:18.100 --> 34:25.100]  but then knowing that you fall short 95% of the time.
[34:25.100 --> 34:28.100]  Everything we do has had a huge effect.
[34:28.100 --> 34:32.100]  The enemy knows that Info Wars is marked for victory.
[34:32.100 --> 34:35.100]  They know our destiny is destroying them.
[34:40.100 --> 34:43.100]  My problem, and I was already going to come on here
[34:43.100 --> 34:45.100]  and talk about this today.
[34:49.100 --> 34:53.100]  And then five minutes before I went on air,
[34:53.100 --> 34:58.100]  I just exploded mentally with thousands of data points
[34:58.100 --> 35:01.100]  and how to defeat the globalists in a huge battle plan.
[35:01.100 --> 35:03.100]  And then you're supposed to go on air with that.
[35:03.100 --> 35:05.100]  And then the first little mistake that happens,
[35:05.100 --> 35:06.100]  getting ready for the show,
[35:06.100 --> 35:12.100]  I just run off the rails and the race car explodes.
[35:12.100 --> 35:16.100]  Now, juxtapose that with people walking around like zombies
[35:16.100 --> 35:19.100]  that don't even care about being conscious or on this planet
[35:19.100 --> 35:23.100]  or aren't even curious about where we come from.
[35:23.100 --> 35:26.100]  There's those people that are in a trance.
[35:26.100 --> 35:28.100]  There's those of us that are awake,
[35:28.100 --> 35:31.100]  and then there's those that are awake
[35:31.100 --> 35:33.100]  but decided to join evil.
[35:36.100 --> 35:38.100]  And I'm not a victim.
[35:38.100 --> 35:40.100]  I'm not complaining,
[35:40.100 --> 35:42.100]  but I just am going to be honest with the audience
[35:42.100 --> 35:44.100]  because I know what you're going through as well.
[35:44.100 --> 35:51.100]  I don't want to read about all the evil they're involved in.
[35:51.100 --> 35:54.100]  I mean, 20 years ago, I'd find some corruption point.
[35:54.100 --> 35:55.100]  I'd go, oh, look at this,
[35:55.100 --> 35:57.100]  or I'd find that you had admitted they wanted to take guns.
[35:57.100 --> 35:59.100]  And I'd go, oh, look, they really want the guns.
[35:59.100 --> 36:01.100]  They say they don't, but here's their own document.
[36:01.100 --> 36:03.100]  Now it's just out in the open.
[36:03.100 --> 36:06.100]  Hey, we're going to come get your kids in preschool
[36:06.100 --> 36:07.100]  and have sex with them.
[36:07.100 --> 36:17.100]  I mean, that's in the news today.
[36:17.100 --> 36:25.100]  And so there's a balance point somewhere there I've got to find
[36:25.100 --> 36:30.100]  because I know listeners of this broadcast are not sociopaths.
[36:30.100 --> 36:32.100]  People that don't have feelings,
[36:32.100 --> 36:34.100]  they're just like reptoid machines
[36:34.100 --> 36:41.100]  that only care about their own financial power.
[36:41.100 --> 36:43.100]  And then psychopaths,
[36:43.100 --> 36:45.100]  which run a whole gamut of different types of people,
[36:45.100 --> 36:47.100]  but that enjoy hurting people
[36:47.100 --> 36:51.100]  and don't have feelings on top of it.
[36:51.100 --> 36:53.100]  And it's not that I admire those people.
[36:53.100 --> 36:56.100]  I actually hate their guts and I'm always fighting with them.
[36:56.100 --> 37:04.100]  It's that I wish I had a little bit of that.
[37:04.100 --> 37:07.100]  You know, used to I'd make jokes about evil stuff going on
[37:07.100 --> 37:09.100]  and be sarcastic and sardonic.
[37:09.100 --> 37:11.100]  As a coping strategy,
[37:11.100 --> 37:16.100]  I would just halfway get into the mental role
[37:16.100 --> 37:18.100]  of one of those evil people so I could just kind of like,
[37:18.100 --> 37:20.100]  somebody's been swimming for a hundred miles
[37:20.100 --> 37:23.100]  trying to piece of wood like, oh, oh, oh.
[37:23.100 --> 37:26.100]  I just look at the sociopath and I'm like, oh, man,
[37:26.100 --> 37:28.100]  I hate them. They're the enemy.
[37:28.100 --> 37:31.100]  But wow, what must it be like to just be on a power trip
[37:31.100 --> 37:35.100]  and not give a damn and just be happy screwing everybody over
[37:35.100 --> 37:38.100]  and like targeting children?
[37:38.100 --> 37:40.100]  I had Dr. Sherry Tenpenny,
[37:40.100 --> 37:43.100]  who's been on my broadcast now for over 22 years,
[37:43.100 --> 37:45.100]  renowned medical doctor, whole nine yards,
[37:45.100 --> 37:48.100]  sees the kid's brain damage, goes public, gets attacked,
[37:48.100 --> 37:50.100]  totally vindicated.
[37:50.100 --> 37:54.100]  They're covering up vaccine damages.
[37:54.100 --> 37:57.100]  And she said, it's a planetary plan to depopulate us
[37:57.100 --> 38:01.100]  and they're targeting our children to destroy the future.
[38:01.100 --> 38:04.100]  And she says, that's why we've got to annihilate them.
[38:04.100 --> 38:07.100]  Now, that's not the woman I knew 22 years ago.
[38:07.100 --> 38:10.100]  She was strong and smart then.
[38:10.100 --> 38:13.100]  But now she's, we must annihilate them.
[38:13.100 --> 38:15.100]  Because that's true.
[38:15.100 --> 38:20.100]  These people have crawled up out from the pit of hell.
[38:20.100 --> 38:24.100]  And that's all I'm saying is there's no half measures.
[38:24.100 --> 38:28.100]  You go to a leftist event and they act like satanic ghouls
[38:28.100 --> 38:34.100]  because they are satanic ghouls.
[38:34.100 --> 38:37.100]  And Nietzsche said, don't look too long into the abyss
[38:37.100 --> 38:39.100]  unless you become the abyss.
[38:39.100 --> 38:45.100]  I'm not becoming the abyss.
[38:45.100 --> 38:48.100]  But I am in the abyss.
[38:48.100 --> 38:51.100]  And I get why people just punch out and go to sleep
[38:51.100 --> 38:54.100]  and are distracted because they're not openly evil.
[38:54.100 --> 38:56.100]  They don't want to be evil, but they're like, whoa,
[38:56.100 --> 38:58.100]  I can't handle this.
[38:58.100 --> 39:01.100]  You see, it's so over the top five years ago
[39:01.100 --> 39:05.100]  to hand out condoms to seven, eight-year-olds
[39:05.100 --> 39:08.100]  and up at Boy Scout events
[39:08.100 --> 39:11.100]  and tell them to go have sex with adults,
[39:11.100 --> 39:13.100]  that everybody just went, whoa,
[39:13.100 --> 39:17.100]  and couldn't even talk about it because it was so insane.
[39:17.100 --> 39:19.100]  And see, that's evil's trick,
[39:19.100 --> 39:23.100]  is it does things so exponentially insane
[39:23.100 --> 39:28.100]  and so ridiculously evil that like an amoeba,
[39:28.100 --> 39:30.100]  you can have an amoeba in a dish of water
[39:30.100 --> 39:33.100]  and put a heat source in it, and that amoeba will run.
[39:33.100 --> 39:37.100]  It's a single cell organism that will run from the heat.
[39:37.100 --> 39:38.100]  And that's why evil does that.
[39:38.100 --> 39:40.100]  That's why they vomit forth corruption
[39:40.100 --> 39:42.100]  and then have the news, normalize it.
[39:42.100 --> 39:44.100]  So you're very programming that God gave you,
[39:44.100 --> 39:49.100]  goes, huh, and fries you to where you just kind of give up.
[39:49.100 --> 39:51.100]  I get it. See, I don't give up.
[39:51.100 --> 39:53.100]  I start fighting and fighting and fighting.
[39:53.100 --> 39:56.100]  But I've got to find that point where I realize
[39:56.100 --> 39:58.100]  it's in God's hands and in God's plan
[39:58.100 --> 40:01.100]  and just do the right thing and have a spirit of calm
[40:01.100 --> 40:04.100]  like the Bible says, because if you don't,
[40:04.100 --> 40:12.100]  evil will go insane.
[40:12.100 --> 40:15.100]  But I could look at Hillary Clinton five years ago.
[40:15.100 --> 40:17.100]  I can't even look at her now.
[40:17.100 --> 40:21.100]  She is a jack-o'-lantern-headed pedophile demon.
[40:21.100 --> 40:26.100]  I mean, a literal interdimensional space alien
[40:26.100 --> 40:30.100]  jacked in, took her over, and that is a fricking devil, man,
[40:30.100 --> 40:32.100]  from deep space out of some black hole
[40:32.100 --> 40:34.100]  here to feed on our children.
[40:34.100 --> 40:39.100]  And I'm not saying that as some literary flourish.
[40:39.100 --> 40:41.100]  She is that.
[40:41.100 --> 40:43.100]  And you're like, well, why is it so evil?
[40:43.100 --> 40:46.100]  Because that's the type of creature that would do this.
[40:46.100 --> 40:48.100]  You're like, why are they so evil?
[40:48.100 --> 40:51.100]  Because that exists in the universe.
[40:51.100 --> 40:53.100]  There's good and there's bad.
[40:53.100 --> 40:55.100]  And we have to admit there's good and bad
[40:55.100 --> 40:58.100]  and not be relativist or we can't defend ourselves
[40:58.100 --> 41:05.100]  against that thing come climbing up out of hell.
[41:05.100 --> 41:09.100]  On its elbows, like Medusa,
[41:09.100 --> 41:16.100]  to literally devour our children with that Bloomberg creature,
[41:16.100 --> 41:20.100]  all of you should thank God you're not Michael Bloomberg.
[41:20.100 --> 41:27.100]  I mean, the man is a absolute soulless husk.
[41:27.100 --> 41:29.100]  And that's why he acts like a space alien.
[41:29.100 --> 41:32.100]  He shakes dog's faces, says, look, kill your baby.
[41:32.100 --> 41:33.100]  Let's kill old people.
[41:33.100 --> 41:34.100]  Farmers suck.
[41:34.100 --> 41:36.100]  Well, they grow things.
[41:36.100 --> 41:37.100]  I have information.
[41:37.100 --> 41:42.100]  It takes a lot of power to have Michael Bloomberg.
[41:42.100 --> 41:44.100]  Kill your baby.
[41:44.100 --> 41:45.100]  Kill the humans.
[41:45.100 --> 41:50.100]  Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[41:50.100 --> 41:52.100]  I mean, that's what he is.
[41:52.100 --> 41:53.100]  You could see him spiritually.
[41:53.100 --> 41:57.100]  He's like a one foot tall goblin with pus running out his rear end,
[41:57.100 --> 42:02.100]  just dragging along, stinking to high heaven.
[42:02.100 --> 42:04.100]  And then he just sees humans make the image of God.
[42:04.100 --> 42:07.100]  These towering mountains of light.
[42:07.100 --> 42:12.100]  But he's able to crawl into our ear or up our nose like a worm
[42:12.100 --> 42:19.100]  and just into our brain, just eat holes in it.
[42:19.100 --> 42:20.100]  And then just look at him.
[42:20.100 --> 42:25.100]  Everything he does is some weird, twisted, pedophilic, homoerotic,
[42:25.100 --> 42:29.100]  you know, outfit hopping around with a devil tail.
[42:29.100 --> 42:31.100]  He's just showing you who he is.
[42:31.100 --> 42:33.100]  He's gone.
[42:33.100 --> 42:35.100]  He's gone.
[42:35.100 --> 42:37.100]  And he wants your guns.
[42:37.100 --> 42:40.100]  And he wants to shut off US power plants.
[42:40.100 --> 42:43.100]  His mission as a soldier is to get your children,
[42:43.100 --> 42:46.100]  take your guns, and blow our generators.
[42:46.100 --> 42:47.100]  You can hear him.
[42:47.100 --> 42:49.100]  Sir, we've reached the shield generator.
[42:49.100 --> 42:52.100]  You may start your landing, target US energy,
[42:52.100 --> 42:55.100]  and their children, maximum firepower.
[42:55.100 --> 42:57.100]  Yeah.
[42:57.100 --> 43:01.100]  I have confirmed with high level sources that President Trump
[43:01.100 --> 43:05.100]  is intending to either pardon Roger Stone after his sentencing
[43:05.100 --> 43:08.100]  or give him clemency, saying the conviction stands,
[43:08.100 --> 43:11.100]  but you now basically don't go to jail.
[43:11.100 --> 43:13.100]  Either way, this is incredibly good news.
[43:13.100 --> 43:16.100]  But let's not forget Julian Assange.
[43:16.100 --> 43:19.100]  That's one of the biggest black marks on Trump is that he famously
[43:19.100 --> 43:21.100]  said, I don't know who got the emails.
[43:21.100 --> 43:23.100]  I don't know where they came from.
[43:23.100 --> 43:25.100]  The Russians, a fat dude in his mom's basement,
[43:25.100 --> 43:27.100]  whoever's got them, release them.
[43:27.100 --> 43:29.100]  It's about Hillary committing a crime,
[43:29.100 --> 43:31.100]  not who has the emails, don't change the subject.
[43:31.100 --> 43:34.100]  Well, Julian Assange undoubtedly took Trump over the top.
[43:34.100 --> 43:36.100]  The WikiLeaks exposed the deep state.
[43:36.100 --> 43:37.100]  The man is a hero.
[43:37.100 --> 43:39.100]  Daniel Ellsberg was a hero.
[43:39.100 --> 43:41.100]  Well, Assange is even a bigger hero,
[43:41.100 --> 43:43.100]  and he's rotting in solitary confinement,
[43:43.100 --> 43:45.100]  and at court hearings can barely talk.
[43:45.100 --> 43:47.100]  President Trump do the right thing
[43:47.100 --> 43:49.100]  and asked the British to release Julian Assange
[43:49.100 --> 43:51.100]  and give him a medal.
[43:51.100 --> 43:54.100]  President Trump, you must release Julian Assange.
[43:54.100 --> 43:56.100]  Free Julian Assange!
[43:56.100 --> 43:58.100]  Free Julian Assange!
[43:58.100 --> 44:00.100]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[44:00.100 --> 44:04.100]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[44:04.100 --> 44:06.100]  It's very communicable.
[44:06.100 --> 44:08.100]  It spreads very, very fast.
[44:08.100 --> 44:10.100]  It is killing a lot of people,
[44:10.100 --> 44:12.100]  and the Chinese Communist government has covered up
[44:12.100 --> 44:14.100]  just how bad it is,
[44:14.100 --> 44:16.100]  and the White House is now openly challenging them,
[44:16.100 --> 44:18.100]  show our Trump's top scientist,
[44:18.100 --> 44:20.100]  and so is Senator Cotton.
[44:20.100 --> 44:24.100]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[44:24.100 --> 44:27.100]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[44:27.100 --> 44:29.100]  The globalists are trying to create
[44:29.100 --> 44:31.100]  economic collapse, race riots.
[44:31.100 --> 44:34.100]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[44:34.100 --> 44:37.100]  That's why listeners to M4 Wars need to be prepared.
[44:37.100 --> 44:40.100]  And M4warStore.com has the products
[44:40.100 --> 44:43.100]  that make your life better and make you healthier.
[44:43.100 --> 44:45.100]  Healthier, we have the last of the immune gargle
[44:45.100 --> 44:47.100]  selling out as we speak.
[44:47.100 --> 44:49.100]  We have high-quality, storeable foods,
[44:49.100 --> 44:51.100]  ready to ship, and vitamin mineral fusion
[44:51.100 --> 44:54.100]  is back in stock, along with Ultra-12
[44:54.100 --> 44:57.100]  at M4warStore.com.
[44:59.100 --> 45:00.100]  Real stuff, man.
[45:00.100 --> 45:02.100]  We're talking about the real deal here,
[45:02.100 --> 45:04.100]  and I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you,
[45:04.100 --> 45:06.100]  he sits there and lets these big tech people
[45:06.100 --> 45:08.100]  keep running roughshod over everybody's arms.
[45:08.100 --> 45:10.100]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[45:10.100 --> 45:12.100]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[45:12.100 --> 45:14.100]  Like I said, about two months ago,
[45:14.100 --> 45:16.100]  I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[45:16.100 --> 45:19.100]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers,
[45:19.100 --> 45:22.100]  20 different stickers, impeach the Democrats,
[45:22.100 --> 45:25.100]  save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment,
[45:25.100 --> 45:27.100]  M4warStore.com, and it looks like duct tape,
[45:27.100 --> 45:29.100]  but it's just a regular sticker.
[45:29.100 --> 45:31.100]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally,
[45:31.100 --> 45:33.100]  and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[45:33.100 --> 45:35.100]  People say, why are you doing this? What's happening?
[45:35.100 --> 45:37.100]  When you go, well, we're being censored,
[45:37.100 --> 45:39.100]  you know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[45:39.100 --> 45:41.100]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think,
[45:41.100 --> 45:43.100]  why are you doing this yet?
[45:43.100 --> 45:46.100]  It's brilliant. You've taken the very element
[45:46.100 --> 45:49.100]  that they try to repress you with, that silence,
[45:49.100 --> 45:51.100]  and made it into a weapon.
[45:51.100 --> 45:54.100]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[45:54.100 --> 45:57.100]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[45:57.100 --> 45:59.100]  Silence.
[45:59.100 --> 46:01.100]  Silence.
[46:01.100 --> 46:03.100]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin,
[46:03.100 --> 46:06.100]  it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.
[46:06.100 --> 46:10.100]  Wind, heat, water, and age are telltale signs
[46:10.100 --> 46:12.100]  in care of your skin.
[46:12.100 --> 46:14.100]  With the InfraWars Super Silver Cream,
[46:14.100 --> 46:17.100]  you can keep your skin feeling silky smooth
[46:17.100 --> 46:20.100]  and begin to heal the damages of the world around you.
[46:20.100 --> 46:22.100]  Created with ingredients like coconut oil,
[46:22.100 --> 46:26.100]  vitamin E, and the incredible silver salt formula,
[46:26.100 --> 46:29.100]  InfraWars Silver Cream works triple duty,

[46:32.100 --> 46:36.100]  in a fast, non-greasy formula, small and easily stored.
[46:36.100 --> 46:38.100]  It can support dry and damaged skin
[46:38.100 --> 46:40.100]  with fine lines and wrinkles,
[46:40.100 --> 46:42.100]  while smoothing and softening calluses.
[46:42.100 --> 46:45.100]  With none of the harmful ingredients found in other formulas,
[46:45.100 --> 46:48.100]  you can be sure this silver cream is hard at work,
[46:48.100 --> 46:50.100]  promoting the healing of your skin.
[46:50.100 --> 46:54.100]  Don't miss out on the new silver salt-powered Can't Miss formula.
[46:54.100 --> 47:09.100]  InfraWars Super Silver Cream today.
[47:24.100 --> 47:39.100]  President Trump is going to win the 2020 election
[47:39.100 --> 47:43.100]  on our current trajectory.
[47:43.100 --> 47:49.100]  The President Trump's not doing everything we want.
[47:49.100 --> 47:55.100]  So, we're going to have to target Trump.
[47:55.100 --> 48:02.100]  But that's not a bad thing to do,
[48:02.100 --> 48:06.100]  and we're not doing it from an aggressive or mean-spirited place
[48:06.100 --> 48:08.100]  like we did with Hillary Clinton.
[48:08.100 --> 48:11.100]  Just begging for her to kill me.
[48:11.100 --> 48:15.100]  Sitting in hundreds of people paying up to 5,000 a piece
[48:15.100 --> 48:18.100]  to say Bill Clinton's a rapist and publicly doing it,
[48:18.100 --> 48:23.100]  and then paying out almost $400,000 in cash.
[48:23.100 --> 48:26.100]  Because, hey, people wanted to do it,
[48:26.100 --> 48:29.100]  but it's fun to get paid while you do it.
[48:29.100 --> 48:34.100]  Bill Clinton's a rapist got you $1,000 if it was on local TV,
[48:34.100 --> 48:40.100]  2,000 for national TV, and 5,000 if you said it to Bill Clinton's face.
[48:40.100 --> 48:45.100]  And they have done horrible things to me since then,
[48:45.100 --> 48:49.100]  and I love it!
[48:49.100 --> 48:55.100]  Because I have been sent to destroy them, and they know it.
[48:55.100 --> 48:58.100]  You see, vengeance belongs to the Lord,
[48:58.100 --> 49:01.100]  but there are instruments of God,
[49:01.100 --> 49:07.100]  and I can feel God's rage.
[49:07.100 --> 49:09.100]  That's why I don't fear the enemy,
[49:09.100 --> 49:12.100]  the shrunken head of Hillary,
[49:12.100 --> 49:18.100]  or Bill, that reanimated corpse.
[49:18.100 --> 49:20.100]  I thank God every millisecond,
[49:20.100 --> 49:23.100]  because I can feel the presence of God.
[49:23.100 --> 49:25.100]  And people say, how do you take on these people?
[49:25.100 --> 49:27.100]  They can kill you, they can destroy you.
[49:27.100 --> 49:29.100]  Well, they're trying, and quite frankly,
[49:29.100 --> 49:31.100]  I just want to be able to stand the fight as long as I can.
[49:31.100 --> 49:33.100]  I don't care if they destroy me.
[49:33.100 --> 49:37.100]  I just get mad because I want to stab them and stab them
[49:37.100 --> 49:40.100]  and just politically just decapitate them with one...
[49:40.100 --> 49:43.100]  Yeah! Yeah!
[49:43.100 --> 49:45.100]  My full will against you,
[49:45.100 --> 49:47.100]  my hands around your spiritual neck,
[49:47.100 --> 49:49.100]  crushing you with God empowering me,
[49:49.100 --> 49:51.100]  unlimited, unlimited!
[49:51.100 --> 49:55.100]  I'll crush you, crush you, I'll crush you!
[49:55.100 --> 49:58.100]  And you know it!
[49:58.100 --> 50:01.100]  And I'm not going to sit here and hold back anymore.
[50:01.100 --> 50:07.100]  And we need people to stop fearing these devil worshipers.
[50:07.100 --> 50:12.100]  Now, let's move on to Trump.
[50:12.100 --> 50:15.100]  Now, time for Bible study.
[50:15.100 --> 50:21.100]  You see,
[50:21.100 --> 50:25.100]  victories are as we simply take it in our hands.
[50:25.100 --> 50:29.100]  The globalists spend all their time
[50:29.100 --> 50:32.100]  demoralizing us and telling us it's all lost
[50:32.100 --> 50:35.100]  and running around with our children
[50:35.100 --> 50:39.100]  at daycares and public schools where they've captured them,
[50:39.100 --> 50:42.100]  showing little girls riding on men's genitals
[50:42.100 --> 50:44.100]  in front of everyone as a symbol of,
[50:44.100 --> 50:46.100]  we've captured your flag, we've defeated you,
[50:46.100 --> 50:48.100]  it's all over, we have your children.
[50:48.100 --> 50:51.100]  No, you have a few pedophile parents
[50:51.100 --> 50:55.100]  that brought their children to pedophile events to flaunt it.
[50:55.100 --> 50:58.100]  Just because you've captured and hurt some children
[50:58.100 --> 51:01.100]  doesn't mean you've kicked anybody's ass.
[51:01.100 --> 51:04.100]  In fact, if we don't bow to this
[51:04.100 --> 51:07.100]  and become demoralized, if we take action
[51:07.100 --> 51:11.100]  and confront them and get in their face,
[51:11.100 --> 51:17.100]  it's over for the devil worshipers.
[51:17.100 --> 51:20.100]  I mean, I've got the articles right here
[51:20.100 --> 51:23.100]  that I haven't gotten to where,
[51:23.100 --> 51:25.100]  I mean, just every day without me even looking,
[51:25.100 --> 51:29.100]  they're here with now elementary schools
[51:29.100 --> 51:31.100]  to teach four-year-olds that they need
[51:31.100 --> 51:33.100]  to have their genitals cut off.
[51:33.100 --> 51:36.100]  That's the type of stuff I have here in the stack
[51:36.100 --> 51:40.100]  that drives me insane before I go on air.
[51:40.100 --> 51:43.100]  And so instead of addressing each little piece
[51:43.100 --> 51:45.100]  of the nightmare that we know of,
[51:45.100 --> 51:48.100]  let's just go right to the heart of the matter,
[51:48.100 --> 51:51.100]  that these are spiritually dead people
[51:51.100 --> 51:53.100]  and misery loves company
[51:53.100 --> 51:57.100]  and they want us to join them.
[51:57.100 --> 52:00.100]  Well, I'm not joining them.
[52:00.100 --> 52:04.100]  And it comes down to that.
[52:04.100 --> 52:10.100]  So let me do this.
[52:10.100 --> 52:13.100]  I kind of, I should have launched this over a month ago
[52:13.100 --> 52:15.100]  and I got busy with all the news
[52:15.100 --> 52:19.100]  that you've seen just like you've been busy.
[52:19.100 --> 52:23.100]  And I didn't cover it.
[52:23.100 --> 52:26.100]  But it really is a major path to victory.
[52:26.100 --> 52:31.100]  Why are we going to just go out to Democrat events
[52:31.100 --> 52:33.100]  and take those over with the truth
[52:33.100 --> 52:36.100]  and politely and calmly expose the corruption
[52:36.100 --> 52:39.100]  of each candidate that is well-known?
[52:39.100 --> 52:40.100]  Why not?
[52:40.100 --> 52:42.100]  Why just go to Bloomberg events and say,
[52:42.100 --> 52:44.100]  you're an Epstein's little black book.
[52:44.100 --> 52:47.100]  You're corrupt.
[52:47.100 --> 52:49.100]  You've said kill old ladies.
[52:49.100 --> 52:51.100]  You tell your employees to abort their babies
[52:51.100 --> 52:53.100]  or you'll fire them.
[52:53.100 --> 52:55.100]  That's good. Let's do that.
[52:55.100 --> 52:58.100]  But let's let the neocons that still are in control
[52:58.100 --> 53:01.100]  of much of Trump's apparatus know
[53:01.100 --> 53:05.100]  that we the people aren't going to just sit here
[53:05.100 --> 53:07.100]  and put up with it.
[53:07.100 --> 53:09.100]  So I wrote this yesterday
[53:09.100 --> 53:11.100]  and it's being put up on the site now.
[53:11.100 --> 53:14.100]  The site's, I think, almost done.
[53:14.100 --> 53:15.100]  I was going to have it with Trump
[53:15.100 --> 53:18.100]  with a bunch of jets behind him.
[53:18.100 --> 53:20.100]  OperationWin2020.com.
[53:20.100 --> 53:21.100]  But I thought, you know, they're going to change.
[53:21.100 --> 53:24.100]  It's just a line of people at a Trump rally.
[53:24.100 --> 53:27.100]  That's what this is really all about, is we the people.
[53:27.100 --> 53:33.100]  OperationWin2020 save the first amendment now.
[53:33.100 --> 53:35.100]  And so I wrote this and it's up on the site.
[53:35.100 --> 53:37.100]  I shot a video this morning that'll be up there.
[53:37.100 --> 53:39.100]  And the site should be live now.
[53:39.100 --> 53:40.100]  If not, it'll be launched the next few hours.
[53:40.100 --> 53:41.100]  Let's just go check.
[53:41.100 --> 53:44.100]  OperationWin2020.com.
[53:44.100 --> 53:46.100]  President Trump has done an incredible job
[53:46.100 --> 53:48.100]  taking on the deep state,
[53:48.100 --> 53:50.100]  exposing corruption and kick-starting
[53:50.100 --> 53:53.100]  not only economy, but the soul of America.
[53:53.100 --> 53:57.100]  But his greatest failing is doing almost nothing
[53:57.100 --> 53:59.100]  to defend free speech and expression
[53:59.100 --> 54:00.100]  as enshrined the First Amendment,
[54:00.100 --> 54:02.100]  the most basic and cherished birthright
[54:02.100 --> 54:04.100]  of all Americans.
[54:04.100 --> 54:06.100]  The Justice Department announced in February
[54:06.100 --> 54:07.100]  that they will not be taking action
[54:07.100 --> 54:10.100]  against big tech for antitrust violations
[54:10.100 --> 54:13.100]  and open election meddling.
[54:13.100 --> 54:17.100]  We know President Trump listens to his constituents.
[54:17.100 --> 54:19.100]  We the people of America.
[54:19.100 --> 54:21.100]  I am not going to sit here and leave it to the bureaucrats
[54:21.100 --> 54:23.100]  and corporate cronies and lobbyists in D.C.
[54:23.100 --> 54:25.100]  to pressure Trump to do the right thing
[54:25.100 --> 54:28.100]  because we know it will never happen.
[54:28.100 --> 54:30.100]  They're doing the opposite,
[54:30.100 --> 54:32.100]  making sure President Trump is paralyzed.
[54:32.100 --> 54:34.100]  They're cutting him off from his supporters,
[54:34.100 --> 54:37.100]  the great men and women who voted him into office
[54:37.100 --> 54:40.100]  and who've stood defiantly with him
[54:40.100 --> 54:42.100]  against all the bullying and attacks.
[54:42.100 --> 54:45.100]  That's why we're launching Operation 2020.
[54:45.100 --> 54:48.100]  Save the First Amendment at OperationWin2020.com.

[55:31.100 --> 55:34.100]  and information despite all the continued censorship.
[55:34.100 --> 55:41.100]  And we'll send you 23 stickers at OperationWin2020.com.
[55:41.100 --> 55:43.100]  You can also purchase them there on the site
[55:43.100 --> 55:47.100]  at cost in up to 1,000 pack groups.
[55:47.100 --> 55:51.100]  20 different stickers per pack with 20 different messages.
[55:51.100 --> 55:53.100]  But here's the most basic.
[55:53.100 --> 55:55.100]  Save the first.
[55:55.100 --> 55:57.100]  Looks like duct tape.
[55:57.100 --> 55:59.100]  It doesn't pull out your whiskers or whatever like duct tape would.
[55:59.100 --> 56:01.100]  It's a nice, clean sticker.
[56:01.100 --> 56:05.100]  Those on your mouth.
[56:05.100 --> 56:06.100]  And then people say,
[56:06.100 --> 56:07.100]  why are you all wearing that?
[56:07.100 --> 56:08.100]  You can pull it right off and say,
[56:08.100 --> 56:10.100]  well, because we were being silenced by Big Tech
[56:10.100 --> 56:13.100]  and we don't want to disrupt the rally like the left would do.
[56:13.100 --> 56:15.100]  We're just here because there's so many of us
[56:15.100 --> 56:17.100]  and upwards of half of a lot of folks,
[56:17.100 --> 56:19.100]  even Rolling Stone reporter, they go to these rallies.
[56:19.100 --> 56:22.100]  It's still massive info shirts everywhere.
[56:22.100 --> 56:24.100]  Back in 2016, it was half the shirts.
[56:24.100 --> 56:25.100]  That's how the left went.
[56:25.100 --> 56:26.100]  God, this is the enemy.
[56:26.100 --> 56:27.100]  This is who put this guy in.
[56:27.100 --> 56:28.100]  Well, it's true.
[56:28.100 --> 56:29.100]  You did it, not me.
[56:29.100 --> 56:30.100]  We did it all together.
[56:30.100 --> 56:33.100]  So save the first infowars.com.
[56:33.100 --> 56:38.100]  And you just...
[56:38.100 --> 56:41.100]  Timber Owen did this at the Capitol.
[56:41.100 --> 56:43.100]  And there were people protesting against Trump.
[56:43.100 --> 56:48.100]  That was allowed, but this was too powerful.
[56:48.100 --> 56:50.100]  So they arrested him.
[56:50.100 --> 56:53.100]  So this is the way to go.
[56:53.100 --> 56:56.100]  Operation Win2020.com.
[56:56.100 --> 56:59.100]  You can also buy the stickers at infowars.com.
[56:59.100 --> 57:02.100]  Tim, like 50 packs and 100 packs.
[57:02.100 --> 57:05.100]  And they're up to 1,000 packs.
[57:05.100 --> 57:07.100]  And they're at cost, delivered to your door.
[57:07.100 --> 57:09.100]  And we've printed hundreds and hundreds of thousands of these.
[57:09.100 --> 57:12.100]  And I've also said print even more
[57:12.100 --> 57:14.100]  so that we can throw free ones in every order
[57:14.100 --> 57:15.100]  at infowars.com.
[57:15.100 --> 57:16.100]  But we're taking action.
[57:16.100 --> 57:18.100]  Please don't forget, the immune gargle is selling out
[57:18.100 --> 57:20.100]  the three ounce at one ounce very, very soon.
[57:20.100 --> 57:22.100]  The next day or so with the one ounce.
[57:22.100 --> 57:26.100]  Next four or five days with the three ounce, 3.4 ounce.
[57:26.100 --> 57:28.100]  We also have vitamin refusion back in stock
[57:28.100 --> 57:30.100]  and Ultra 12, both 40% off.
[57:30.100 --> 57:33.100]  Get them together, 50% off on that combo, infowars.com.
[57:33.100 --> 57:35.100]  And that's how you fund this operation.
[57:35.100 --> 57:36.100]  You've got my pledge.
[57:36.100 --> 57:37.100]  You fund me.
[57:37.100 --> 57:39.100]  I will expend every ounce of energy and capital
[57:39.100 --> 57:43.100]  attacking the enemy with every savage amount of will I have
[57:43.100 --> 57:45.100]  in the name of Jesus Christ.
[57:47.100 --> 57:50.100]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies
[57:50.100 --> 57:51.100]  are sold out of food.
[57:51.100 --> 57:53.100]  But I know for a fact from sources they're telling people,
[57:53.100 --> 57:54.100]  oh, we've got it.
[57:54.100 --> 57:56.100]  Get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[57:56.100 --> 57:58.100]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[57:58.100 --> 58:00.100]  I've been on ready for 25 years.
[58:00.100 --> 58:02.100]  I've had storeable food for a long time.
[58:02.100 --> 58:04.100]  And I learned very quickly a lot of these companies,
[58:04.100 --> 58:06.100]  they're fine during normal times.
[58:06.100 --> 58:08.100]  But during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food
[58:08.100 --> 58:10.100]  on hand because of inventory.
[58:10.100 --> 58:11.100]  They'll still take your orders.
[58:11.100 --> 58:14.100]  That's why about 11 years ago I found my Patriot supply,
[58:14.100 --> 58:16.100]  now the biggest, most trusted company out there,
[58:16.100 --> 58:18.100]  and I became a private labeler for them
[58:18.100 --> 58:20.100]  because they actually have it on hand.
[58:20.100 --> 58:21.100]  They actually give it delivered to you on time.
[58:21.100 --> 58:23.100]  They do what they're going to say they're going to do
[58:23.100 --> 58:25.100]  because they want you as a customer over and over again,
[58:25.100 --> 58:26.100]  and they're good people.
[58:26.100 --> 58:28.100]  Now they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping
[58:28.100 --> 58:29.100]  because they've got the food,
[58:29.100 --> 58:31.100]  but they've got to package it record level orders.
[58:31.100 --> 58:35.100]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying
[58:35.100 --> 58:36.100]  with the coronavirus.
[58:36.100 --> 58:38.100]  So get your orders at an infowarstore.com,
[58:38.100 --> 58:40.100]  get the best deals, get it delivered first,
[58:40.100 --> 58:42.100]  they're in our system, it goes right to them,
[58:42.100 --> 58:43.100]  then it funds the info as well.
[58:43.100 --> 59:09.100]  So get prepared, infowarstore.com with Swarble Foods.
[59:13.100 --> 59:16.100]  That robots can be given rights, you name it.
[59:16.100 --> 59:20.100]  They are intimidating and arresting people all over the world
[59:20.100 --> 59:23.100]  who simply misgender someone.
[59:23.100 --> 59:28.100]  So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is
[59:28.100 --> 59:31.100]  if you can't even tell what they are.
[59:31.100 --> 59:34.100]  This is the ultimate Kafkaesque mind control,
[59:34.100 --> 59:37.100]  and there's several big articles up on infowarstore.com
[59:37.100 --> 59:38.100]  that break this down.
[59:38.100 --> 59:40.100]  UK teen fine under house arrest
[59:40.100 --> 59:44.100]  for asking trans police officers, gender, UK mother,
[59:44.100 --> 59:46.100]  spare jail for misgendering trans woman
[59:46.100 --> 1:00:15.100]  ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[1:00:15.100 --> 1:00:20.100]  We're not going to sit back and hope the bureaucrats
[1:00:20.100 --> 1:00:22.100]  get the president to take action.
[1:00:22.100 --> 1:00:31.100]  We're going to take it into our own hands.
[1:00:31.100 --> 1:00:34.100]  It's good to take action, Doug.
[1:00:34.100 --> 1:00:39.100]  I'm going to be at C-Pack next week to say hi.
[1:00:39.100 --> 1:00:45.100]  The first amendment and getting Julian Assange out of jail
[1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:49.100]  and hardening Roger Stone who's sentencing is tomorrow.
[1:00:49.100 --> 1:00:51.100]  Oh, and Shroyer and crew are going to be there.
[1:00:51.100 --> 1:00:56.100]  They're getting on a fancy jet-arrow plane
[1:00:56.100 --> 1:01:02.100]  and flying out to the swamp.
[1:01:02.100 --> 1:01:05.100]  All right, you know, I've talked about for years
[1:01:05.100 --> 1:01:08.100]  doing a show that's not just callers calling in
[1:01:08.100 --> 1:01:10.100]  callers that really have interesting things to say.
[1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:11.100]  They all have interesting things to say,
[1:01:11.100 --> 1:01:12.100]  but really interesting things to say,
[1:01:12.100 --> 1:01:15.100]  the crème de la crème to do a podcast with them.
[1:01:15.100 --> 1:01:18.100]  And I've just been busy trying to get a big enough crew
[1:01:18.100 --> 1:01:20.100]  that'll put up with me so that we can do other shows
[1:01:20.100 --> 1:01:21.100]  and do specialty shows like that.
[1:01:21.100 --> 1:01:24.100]  And we've done a few of those live shows with the callers
[1:01:24.100 --> 1:01:26.100]  as guests.
[1:01:26.100 --> 1:01:28.100]  But the next few segments, I've got some of those folks
[1:01:28.100 --> 1:01:30.100]  who were really interesting yesterday
[1:01:30.100 --> 1:01:32.100]  and got cut down to like a minute or so.
[1:01:32.100 --> 1:01:34.100]  I've got two of these fellers.
[1:01:34.100 --> 1:01:37.100]  I reckon you're going to have them on tomorrow.
[1:01:37.100 --> 1:01:39.100]  It seems like that fella got something to say
[1:01:39.100 --> 1:01:42.100]  that we need air a little bit more of.
[1:01:42.100 --> 1:01:47.100]  So I reckon I'll have me some taters and mustard.
[1:01:47.100 --> 1:01:52.100]  You ought not have done that to that boy, Bloomberg.
[1:01:52.100 --> 1:01:55.100]  So I'm going to call it a sling blade.
[1:01:55.100 --> 1:02:00.100]  I call it a Kaiser blade.
[1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:04.100]  So we're going to be talking to them coming up here
[1:02:04.100 --> 1:02:08.100]  in just a moment.
[1:02:08.100 --> 1:02:10.100]  And then there's so much news.
[1:02:10.100 --> 1:02:12.100]  I'll just be honest with you.
[1:02:12.100 --> 1:02:15.100]  I look at this stuff and then it's just so over the top.
[1:02:15.100 --> 1:02:19.100]  It almost seems abusive to report this stuff on here.
[1:02:19.100 --> 1:02:23.100]  I mean, two adults, I say the stuff they're teaching
[1:02:23.100 --> 1:02:26.100]  four and five-year-olds in school, word for word,
[1:02:26.100 --> 1:02:31.100]  and stations call up and complain.
[1:02:31.100 --> 1:02:33.100]  And we go, what are we supposed to do?
[1:02:33.100 --> 1:02:35.100]  And that this should not be broadcast.
[1:02:35.100 --> 1:02:37.100]  It shouldn't be taught to five-year-olds.
[1:02:37.100 --> 1:02:39.100]  And it doesn't have the effect if you don't say it.
[1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:40.100]  But guess what?
[1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:41.100]  Stations don't call and complain anymore.
[1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:44.100]  They understand it because they see it everywhere too.
[1:02:44.100 --> 1:02:48.100]  It'll be putting a good light pedophilia on the national news.
[1:02:48.100 --> 1:02:51.100]  But then if we say it's bad and play a clip
[1:02:51.100 --> 1:02:53.100]  of what was said on the news, we're bad.
[1:02:53.100 --> 1:02:55.100]  Because we're on a lot of Christian stations
[1:02:55.100 --> 1:02:56.100]  and conservative stations and I get it.
[1:02:56.100 --> 1:02:59.100]  I don't want to look at this stuff.
[1:02:59.100 --> 1:03:01.100]  But I prayed about it.
[1:03:01.100 --> 1:03:06.100]  And what's allowed all this to happen is not exposing it
[1:03:06.100 --> 1:03:09.100]  and then letting the establishment always bring stuff out
[1:03:09.100 --> 1:03:12.100]  the way they want to and put it in their light.
[1:03:12.100 --> 1:03:19.100]  And just be doing stuff so nasty, so over the top, so evil,
[1:03:19.100 --> 1:03:27.100]  that we just go, whoa!
[1:03:27.100 --> 1:03:29.100]  It's not like it's so horrible.
[1:03:29.100 --> 1:03:30.100]  We're ashamed to cover it.
[1:03:30.100 --> 1:03:35.100]  It's just like you're hit with something this bad, this evil,
[1:03:35.100 --> 1:03:38.100]  this over the top and you're just like, I get it.
[1:03:38.100 --> 1:03:41.100]  Because my mind every day is like, just don't do it to me again.
[1:03:41.100 --> 1:03:43.100]  Just don't make me look at it.
[1:03:43.100 --> 1:03:44.100]  Don't make me don't know.
[1:03:44.100 --> 1:03:45.100]  No, I have to look at Bloomberg and Hillary.
[1:03:45.100 --> 1:03:47.100]  No, I have to hear it.
[1:03:47.100 --> 1:03:51.100]  And then hear the lies and see all the psyops that are running
[1:03:51.100 --> 1:03:52.100]  and know what they're behind.
[1:03:52.100 --> 1:03:56.100]  I mean, I meant to start the show with this today.
[1:03:56.100 --> 1:03:58.100]  And there's a lot of self-loathing that happens
[1:03:58.100 --> 1:04:03.100]  because Bloomberg is so bad that if I strung together
[1:04:03.100 --> 1:04:06.100]  much of the things he said done in a professional report
[1:04:06.100 --> 1:04:08.100]  and just presented it as a newscaster,
[1:04:08.100 --> 1:04:11.100]  it would hurt him really bad.
[1:04:11.100 --> 1:04:14.100]  And then there's just too much evil coming in, though.
[1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:17.100]  It's like having a tennis ball machine where you're supposed
[1:04:17.100 --> 1:04:20.100]  to be hitting one tennis ball every 10 seconds.
[1:04:20.100 --> 1:04:22.100]  It's a tennis ball every half a second.
[1:04:22.100 --> 1:04:24.100]  Tennis balls, tennis balls, tennis balls, tennis balls.
[1:04:24.100 --> 1:04:36.100]  But Bloomberg is fabulously evil, fabulously horrible.
[1:04:36.100 --> 1:04:40.100]  And his money is everywhere.
[1:04:40.100 --> 1:04:43.100]  And I knew he was buying mayors and governors.
[1:04:43.100 --> 1:04:48.100]  Did you know he pays the salary in hundreds of cities of prosecutors?
[1:04:48.100 --> 1:04:52.100]  Democrats have passed laws where Bloomberg pays the prosecutors
[1:04:52.100 --> 1:04:56.100]  in your towns.
[1:04:56.100 --> 1:04:59.100]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[1:04:59.100 --> 1:05:03.100]  Ultra 12 and vitamin mineral fusion are both back in stock
[1:05:03.100 --> 1:05:06.100]  after being sold out for months.
[1:05:06.100 --> 1:05:09.100]  Vitamin mineral fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals,
[1:05:09.100 --> 1:05:13.100]  amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you
[1:05:13.100 --> 1:05:15.100]  and your family, especially your children's bodies
[1:05:15.100 --> 1:05:17.100]  and your immune systems.
[1:05:17.100 --> 1:05:21.100]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12
[1:05:21.100 --> 1:05:23.100]  taken sublingually under the tongue.
[1:05:23.100 --> 1:05:24.100]  It is back in stock.
[1:05:24.100 --> 1:05:29.100]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now
[1:05:29.100 --> 1:05:33.100]  and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[1:05:33.100 --> 1:05:35.100]  This makes your life so much better
[1:05:35.100 --> 1:05:38.100]  when you have a good multivitamin mineral
[1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:41.100]  that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[1:05:41.100 --> 1:05:45.100]  And of course, vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation
[1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:49.100]  of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[1:05:49.100 --> 1:05:52.100]  And they're both back in stock 40% off individually
[1:05:52.100 --> 1:06:21.100]  for 50% off when you get them together at infoorstore.com.
[1:06:22.100 --> 1:06:45.100]  Here we are on this live Wednesday,
[1:06:45.100 --> 1:06:47.100]  February 19, 2020 transmission.
[1:06:47.100 --> 1:06:49.100]  And for the next two segments,
[1:06:49.100 --> 1:06:56.100]  Adam, Harry, Cassidy is our guest and Braden Morrison.
[1:06:56.100 --> 1:07:00.100]  And I've said I'm going to do a whole show that's just callers
[1:07:00.100 --> 1:07:02.100]  where we then get in contact with them
[1:07:02.100 --> 1:07:05.100]  and have them on as guests via Skype.
[1:07:05.100 --> 1:07:08.100]  And so even if I don't start the show soon,
[1:07:08.100 --> 1:07:11.100]  every week at least, I'm just doing it for a few segments
[1:07:11.100 --> 1:07:14.100]  every week with callers.
[1:07:14.100 --> 1:07:18.100]  So Adam Cassidy is the grandson of Harry Cassidy.
[1:07:18.100 --> 1:07:19.100]  We looked all this up.
[1:07:19.100 --> 1:07:22.100]  He was a key founding socialism as a political force in Canada.
[1:07:22.100 --> 1:07:25.100]  And he has Tower of Babel.ca.
[1:07:25.100 --> 1:07:27.100]  And immediately as I heard him talking,
[1:07:27.100 --> 1:07:28.100]  I knew he knew what he was talking about.
[1:07:28.100 --> 1:07:29.100]  I said, well, you ought to have him.
[1:07:29.100 --> 1:07:30.100]  You want us to, you know, a quick guesstimate.
[1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:31.100]  You may be more after that.
[1:07:31.100 --> 1:07:34.100]  And then Braden Morrison is an info wars listener,
[1:07:34.100 --> 1:07:36.100]  caller and college student in Washington state.
[1:07:36.100 --> 1:07:38.100]  He was just talking about how crazy they are
[1:07:38.100 --> 1:07:40.100]  with the Caitlyn Bennett being attacked
[1:07:40.100 --> 1:07:44.100]  and driven off of a major university in the media,
[1:07:44.100 --> 1:07:46.100]  praising it by a rioting mob.
[1:07:46.100 --> 1:07:48.100]  And he's been politically active since he was old enough
[1:07:48.100 --> 1:07:51.100]  to watch Dorothy Explorer and all that brainwashing.
[1:07:51.100 --> 1:07:54.100]  The only thing he likes more than 90s hip hop
[1:07:54.100 --> 1:07:56.100]  is justice and freedom of the American people.
[1:07:56.100 --> 1:08:00.100]  So I appreciate you both joining us to spend some more time.
[1:08:00.100 --> 1:08:03.100]  Mr. Cassidy, just in a nutshell,
[1:08:03.100 --> 1:08:04.100]  he's only had a few minutes yesterday,
[1:08:04.100 --> 1:08:07.100]  you were just getting into why the Communist
[1:08:07.100 --> 1:08:10.100]  credit tower of Babel, what their plan is.
[1:08:10.100 --> 1:08:13.100]  It's just like Victor Orban just came out and said,
[1:08:13.100 --> 1:08:16.100]  Democrats are communists with degrees.
[1:08:16.100 --> 1:08:18.100]  So quantify your knowledge from, you know,
[1:08:18.100 --> 1:08:19.100]  being part of one of the leading,
[1:08:19.100 --> 1:08:21.100]  because I looked it up at who you are and confirmed it,
[1:08:21.100 --> 1:08:25.100]  one of the leading communist families in Canada.
[1:08:25.100 --> 1:08:28.100]  Well, I see this as a psychosis
[1:08:28.100 --> 1:08:31.100]  and they want to teach it to children.
[1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:34.100]  And the psychosis is, it's almost a reversal
[1:08:34.100 --> 1:08:38.100]  of the polarity of life where your DNA
[1:08:38.100 --> 1:08:39.100]  forms your consciousness.
[1:08:39.100 --> 1:08:42.100]  And I've had complex arguments with people where they say
[1:08:42.100 --> 1:08:46.100]  that their consciousness is just a happenstance product
[1:08:46.100 --> 1:08:52.100]  of your physical organisms need for a central processing unit.
[1:08:52.100 --> 1:08:55.100]  But this is a psychotic impression of your own existence.
[1:08:55.100 --> 1:08:59.100]  It's a third party impression of your own existence,
[1:08:59.100 --> 1:09:01.100]  as if it's happening to you.
[1:09:01.100 --> 1:09:03.100]  So of course it's not true,
[1:09:03.100 --> 1:09:05.100]  but it's your understanding of life.
[1:09:05.100 --> 1:09:10.100]  So you manifest this psychosis into,
[1:09:10.100 --> 1:09:13.100]  you know, when you try to make a decision, for example,
[1:09:13.100 --> 1:09:16.100]  you send it to the decision-making part of your brain.
[1:09:16.100 --> 1:09:18.100]  And of course, no decision is made,
[1:09:18.100 --> 1:09:20.100]  you have to make it yourself.
[1:09:20.100 --> 1:09:24.100]  So you present it back from that part of your brain
[1:09:24.100 --> 1:09:26.100]  with a list of decisions that are available to you,
[1:09:26.100 --> 1:09:29.100]  and usually that list has one decision on it.
[1:09:29.100 --> 1:09:33.100]  So, I mean, I was forced out of the home
[1:09:33.100 --> 1:09:35.100]  when I was 15 by this stuff,
[1:09:35.100 --> 1:09:37.100]  because I was vehemently opposed to it,
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:40.100]  and I started to reject the Stalinist slogans
[1:09:40.100 --> 1:09:42.100]  and especially the violence in my house.
[1:09:42.100 --> 1:09:44.100]  But my little brother never made it out,
[1:09:44.100 --> 1:09:46.100]  and he went insane.
[1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:50.100]  So that is the psychosis as far as I can explain it.
[1:09:50.100 --> 1:09:52.100]  And by the way, all the big studies show
[1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:55.100]  communists and leftists are extremely mentally ill.
[1:09:55.100 --> 1:09:57.100]  They can be Hispanic, white, black, Asian.
[1:09:57.100 --> 1:10:00.100]  The numbers of criminality and psychosis
[1:10:00.100 --> 1:10:03.100]  is seven to nine times of the studies higher.
[1:10:03.100 --> 1:10:06.100]  Well, if you want to produce criminals and mental patients,
[1:10:06.100 --> 1:10:08.100]  take a look at my family.
[1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:12.100]  So, but I think we're headed for a massive mental health crisis
[1:10:12.100 --> 1:10:16.100]  as this psychosis reaches its ultimate apex,
[1:10:16.100 --> 1:10:18.100]  because these people are starting to realize,
[1:10:18.100 --> 1:10:21.100]  as they become, you know, 40 and 50 years old,
[1:10:21.100 --> 1:10:23.100]  that these ideas are a total failure
[1:10:23.100 --> 1:10:25.100]  and their lives are totally empty.
[1:10:25.100 --> 1:10:28.100]  And on top of that, there's nobody to take care of them
[1:10:28.100 --> 1:10:31.100]  when they're older.
[1:10:31.100 --> 1:10:34.100]  But Bloomberg, the manifestation of soullessness,
[1:10:34.100 --> 1:10:37.100]  telling employees, kill your baby, you'll make more money.
[1:10:37.100 --> 1:10:39.100]  Farmers are the worst people.
[1:10:39.100 --> 1:10:43.100]  I mean, he acts like some invading alien would act
[1:10:43.100 --> 1:10:45.100]  that wanted to sabotage us.
[1:10:45.100 --> 1:10:48.100]  I can't explain to you how insane these people are.
[1:10:48.100 --> 1:10:50.100]  It's a total psychosis.
[1:10:50.100 --> 1:10:52.100]  It's like a demonic possession.
[1:10:52.100 --> 1:10:55.100]  My babies have been aborted in the facilities
[1:10:55.100 --> 1:10:58.100]  that my family legalized and fully funded,
[1:10:58.100 --> 1:11:00.100]  resulting in the death of their grandchildren
[1:11:00.100 --> 1:11:02.100]  and great-grandchildren.
[1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:04.100]  And, you know, I hate to admit it,
[1:11:04.100 --> 1:11:06.100]  but there's fully eight of them in my past.
[1:11:06.100 --> 1:11:08.100]  Well, we've all done things we shouldn't.
[1:11:08.100 --> 1:11:10.100]  What matters is the heart.
[1:11:10.100 --> 1:11:11.100]  Quantified...
[1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:13.100]  Well, it wasn't me doing it necessarily.
[1:11:13.100 --> 1:11:15.100]  I had no choice in the matter.
[1:11:15.100 --> 1:11:17.100]  Sometimes I didn't even know what had happened.
[1:11:17.100 --> 1:11:19.100]  No, I understand. It's just unbelievable.
[1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:20.100]  But you're right.
[1:11:20.100 --> 1:11:22.100]  They're coming into a crisis right now
[1:11:22.100 --> 1:11:26.100]  as the minions aren't getting all the utopia they were told.
[1:11:26.100 --> 1:11:29.100]  Instead, they're getting loneliness and death.
[1:11:29.100 --> 1:11:31.100]  Well, let me be clear.
[1:11:31.100 --> 1:11:35.100]  I was deeply inside this psychosis until I was 40 years old
[1:11:35.100 --> 1:11:37.100]  and, for sure, completely controlled by it
[1:11:37.100 --> 1:11:41.100]  until I was about 20 or 25.
[1:11:41.100 --> 1:11:43.100]  How did you break free?
[1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:46.100]  Like you said, the innate spirit is actually directing us
[1:11:46.100 --> 1:11:50.100]  and going with that and not the outside stimuli?
[1:11:50.100 --> 1:11:54.100]  I honestly was just resisting the violent abuse
[1:11:54.100 --> 1:11:58.100]  I faced every single day in my home when I got home.
[1:11:58.100 --> 1:12:02.100]  And my brother dropped out of school and was super violent.
[1:12:02.100 --> 1:12:04.100]  In fact, he was actually, I think,
[1:12:04.100 --> 1:12:07.100]  in retrospect, terrorism my parents as well by this point.
[1:12:07.100 --> 1:12:09.100]  And I just...
[1:12:09.100 --> 1:12:11.100]  I was just trying to kind of make it another day.
[1:12:11.100 --> 1:12:14.100]  I thought that for sure that they were going to incarcerate me
[1:12:14.100 --> 1:12:16.100]  in a mental facility.
[1:12:16.100 --> 1:12:19.100]  So I just split and hit the streets.
[1:12:19.100 --> 1:12:22.100]  And I didn't think I was going to make it for a long time.
[1:12:22.100 --> 1:12:23.100]  So when I...
[1:12:23.100 --> 1:12:25.100]  Well, that's the thing about the Lefto.
[1:12:25.100 --> 1:12:27.100]  They love to destroy their children.
[1:12:27.100 --> 1:12:30.100]  Even Lefto's women brag how they brainwash
[1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:32.100]  and brain damage their sons particularly.
[1:12:32.100 --> 1:12:34.100]  And now I'm sure you've seen on national news,
[1:12:34.100 --> 1:12:36.100]  they say, I killed my baby girl. I loved it.
[1:12:36.100 --> 1:12:39.100]  I took her life. I have power.
[1:12:39.100 --> 1:12:40.100]  Well, it's crazy.
[1:12:40.100 --> 1:12:43.100]  I still can't get a clear answer how I lost my eyes
[1:12:43.100 --> 1:12:44.100]  as an infant in the home.
[1:12:44.100 --> 1:12:48.100]  And now my younger brother has blinded himself
[1:12:48.100 --> 1:12:51.100]  in psychiatric care in the midst of a complaint
[1:12:51.100 --> 1:12:54.100]  about his treatment on my, from me, being dismissed.
[1:12:54.100 --> 1:12:57.100]  It was literally a spirit of trying to blind you.
[1:12:57.100 --> 1:13:00.100]  That's how I would describe the enemy as a blinding force.
[1:13:00.100 --> 1:13:04.100]  So I want to go to the other guest caller
[1:13:04.100 --> 1:13:07.100]  who's now here via Skype, but that'll be next segment.
[1:13:07.100 --> 1:13:09.100]  I probably need to hold you guys over
[1:13:09.100 --> 1:13:11.100]  because this is a bunch of other guests joining us.
[1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:13.100]  But I looked into who you said you were,
[1:13:13.100 --> 1:13:14.100]  checked it, your family.
[1:13:14.100 --> 1:13:17.100]  I mean, your family going back as grandparents,
[1:13:17.100 --> 1:13:20.100]  leading socialists and communists,
[1:13:20.100 --> 1:13:22.100]  we could do a whole show about them.
[1:13:22.100 --> 1:13:25.100]  Just spend a few minutes talking about them.
[1:13:25.100 --> 1:13:28.100]  Well, I grew up listening to, so we had a big house.
[1:13:28.100 --> 1:13:30.100]  You'd have to see the land of the house.
[1:13:30.100 --> 1:13:32.100]  We had a big second floor with a banister.
[1:13:32.100 --> 1:13:34.100]  And I could come out of my bedroom and listen in.
[1:13:34.100 --> 1:13:37.100]  It was a national amphitheater when they had dinner parties.
[1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:39.100]  So they would put us to bed at like six o'clock
[1:13:39.100 --> 1:13:40.100]  when I was nine years old.
[1:13:40.100 --> 1:13:42.100]  I didn't know why.
[1:13:42.100 --> 1:13:44.100]  We didn't have a TV in the house or anything.
[1:13:44.100 --> 1:13:46.100]  And this is downtown Ottawa.
[1:13:46.100 --> 1:13:47.100]  We lived basically in a slum.
[1:13:47.100 --> 1:13:51.100]  A guy named Marcel Trudeau owned a lot of property down there.
[1:13:51.100 --> 1:13:53.100]  It was known as a slumlord and they were fighting him.
[1:13:53.100 --> 1:13:55.100]  And he was always trying to get our house.
[1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:57.100]  So, but anyway, they'd have dinner parties
[1:13:57.100 --> 1:14:00.100]  and all the NDP alumni, like people like Marion Dewar
[1:14:00.100 --> 1:14:02.100]  who ended up the mayor and her son, Paul Dewar,
[1:14:02.100 --> 1:14:04.100]  ended up being an MP in Ottawa center.
[1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:05.100]  Sure.
[1:14:05.100 --> 1:14:07.100]  What was the year coming out of their mouths?
[1:14:07.100 --> 1:14:08.100]  Evelyn Gigantus.
[1:14:08.100 --> 1:14:10.100]  Well, they would openly talk.
[1:14:10.100 --> 1:14:11.100]  I mean, it's all in code at first,
[1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:13.100]  but then you hear that it cracks
[1:14:13.100 --> 1:14:17.100]  and they'd openly mock their whole method of,
[1:14:17.100 --> 1:14:19.100]  whenever they had nothing to say, they'd say,
[1:14:19.100 --> 1:14:21.100]  the people, the people in their speeches
[1:14:21.100 --> 1:14:23.100]  and they would characterize their own speeches
[1:14:23.100 --> 1:14:26.100]  and their own work as just being a bunch of nonsense.
[1:14:26.100 --> 1:14:28.100]  And then they would express, you know,
[1:14:28.100 --> 1:14:32.100]  their sympathies for the communist system
[1:14:32.100 --> 1:14:35.100]  and that it just had to be done right
[1:14:35.100 --> 1:14:37.100]  and had a very conascending attitude.
[1:14:37.100 --> 1:14:41.100]  All religion is mental illness to them is delusion.
[1:14:41.100 --> 1:14:44.100]  Because they're the state, they need to be worshipped.
[1:14:44.100 --> 1:14:45.100]  Right.
[1:14:45.100 --> 1:14:48.100]  And so, but everything, all policies are fake.
[1:14:48.100 --> 1:14:49.100]  You understand?
[1:14:49.100 --> 1:14:51.100]  It's a Fabian system.
[1:14:51.100 --> 1:14:52.100]  And the Fabian system was-
[1:14:52.100 --> 1:14:54.100]  That's the bottom line is they were bragging how
[1:14:54.100 --> 1:14:57.100]  what they were teaching the masses was all a big joke.
[1:14:57.100 --> 1:14:59.100]  Yes.
[1:14:59.100 --> 1:15:01.100]  And that their whole method, I mean,
[1:15:01.100 --> 1:15:03.100]  they were openly, when they got together,
[1:15:03.100 --> 1:15:06.100]  I mean, I was also around my father all the time.
[1:15:06.100 --> 1:15:07.100]  I was a blatant communist.
[1:15:07.100 --> 1:15:09.100]  I ended up leading the NDP.
[1:15:09.100 --> 1:15:12.100]  You know, the first thing he did was kick out the Waffle Ring
[1:15:12.100 --> 1:15:14.100]  wing who were stating their socialist,
[1:15:14.100 --> 1:15:17.100]  their more heavily socialist communist principles.
[1:15:17.100 --> 1:15:20.100]  Well, they kicked them out because the Fabian philosophy
[1:15:20.100 --> 1:15:22.100]  used to be we're not going to tell you where you're going
[1:15:22.100 --> 1:15:24.100]  for your own good.
[1:15:24.100 --> 1:15:26.100]  Well, now you're not going to tell you when you've arrived.
[1:15:26.100 --> 1:15:28.100]  So they're going to gut any system.
[1:15:28.100 --> 1:15:31.100]  And I think this is what Trump is dismantling right now,
[1:15:31.100 --> 1:15:32.100]  the regulations.
[1:15:32.100 --> 1:15:35.100]  They're going to gut any system and construct their communism
[1:15:35.100 --> 1:15:38.100]  inside it and keep what's left as a facade.
[1:15:38.100 --> 1:15:41.100]  Now, the whole purpose of the third party was to dilute
[1:15:41.100 --> 1:15:45.100]  all elections so that a minority is making the decision
[1:15:45.100 --> 1:15:48.100]  to slowly acclimate people to...
[1:15:48.100 --> 1:15:50.100]  Well, brother, you know, I'm going to stay there, Mr. Cassidy.
[1:15:50.100 --> 1:15:52.100]  We're going to come right back to Mr. Morrison as well.
[1:15:52.100 --> 1:16:19.100]  This is powerful.
[1:16:19.100 --> 1:16:48.100]  We're going to come right back to Mr. Morrison as well.
[1:16:48.100 --> 1:16:55.100]  We're going to come right back to Mr. Morrison as well.
[1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:43.100]  We're going to come right back to Mr. Morrison as well.
[1:17:43.100 --> 1:17:56.100]  We're going to come right back to Mr. Morrison as well.
[1:17:56.100 --> 1:17:58.100]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[1:17:58.100 --> 1:18:02.100]  Coronavirus is a man-made bio-weapon designed to destroy
[1:18:02.100 --> 1:18:05.100]  nation-states, economies, and free peoples,
[1:18:05.100 --> 1:18:08.100]  and usher in a planetary government.
[1:18:08.100 --> 1:18:10.100]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[1:18:10.100 --> 1:18:13.100]  Here's a fortune headline today.
[1:18:13.100 --> 1:18:17.100]  Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3,000 cruise
[1:18:17.100 --> 1:18:22.100]  ship passengers return home, and that's just in one nation.
[1:18:22.100 --> 1:18:27.100]  Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China.
[1:18:27.100 --> 1:18:32.100]  The reporting it could cut their sales in half this year.
[1:18:32.100 --> 1:18:35.100]  That's how major this is.
[1:18:35.100 --> 1:18:37.100]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[1:18:37.100 --> 1:18:40.100]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[1:18:40.100 --> 1:18:43.100]  Info wars will continue to report the latest information
[1:18:43.100 --> 1:18:46.100]  as it comes out, regardless of the fact that the establishment
[1:18:46.100 --> 1:18:49.100]  will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[1:18:49.100 --> 1:18:52.100]  We need you to step into the plate and help spread the word
[1:18:52.100 --> 1:18:56.100]  about Band-Aught Video and infowars.com today.
[1:18:56.100 --> 1:19:00.100]  Across the western world, from high school to college sports
[1:19:00.100 --> 1:19:04.100]  to even the Olympics, men, biological men,
[1:19:04.100 --> 1:19:08.100]  are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[1:19:08.100 --> 1:19:12.100]  This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them
[1:19:12.100 --> 1:19:14.100]  and taking their rights away.
[1:19:14.100 --> 1:19:17.100]  All in the name of the liberalism and openness.
[1:19:17.100 --> 1:19:20.100]  And then every day, I have stacks of news articles.
[1:19:20.100 --> 1:19:23.100]  Just like today, UK team find under house arrest
[1:19:23.100 --> 1:19:26.100]  for asking trans police officers gender,
[1:19:26.100 --> 1:19:28.100]  and it hurt their feelings.
[1:19:28.100 --> 1:19:31.100]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman
[1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:34.100]  ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine
[1:19:34.100 --> 1:19:39.100]  because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[1:19:39.100 --> 1:19:41.100]  That's the thought police.
[1:19:41.100 --> 1:19:44.100]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason,
[1:19:44.100 --> 1:19:46.100]  you get fined and you go to jail.
[1:19:46.100 --> 1:19:49.100]  This is tyranny, these people are bullies,
[1:19:49.100 --> 1:19:51.100]  and it's sick, and it's evil,
[1:19:51.100 --> 1:19:54.100]  and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[1:19:54.100 --> 1:19:56.100]  Resist it, speak out against it.
[1:19:56.100 --> 1:19:59.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:26.100 --> 1:20:28.100]  Well, so does he.
[1:20:28.100 --> 1:20:31.100]  Live from the Infowars.com studios.
[1:20:31.100 --> 1:20:33.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:35.100 --> 1:20:37.100]  So Jacob Ingalls is a reporter.
[1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:39.100]  He's joining us next segment.
[1:20:39.100 --> 1:20:41.100]  He's friends with Roger Stone.
[1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:43.100]  He's been de-platformed everywhere just for covering Roger Stone.
[1:20:43.100 --> 1:20:46.100]  He's had a newspaper written for major publications
[1:20:46.100 --> 1:20:48.100]  for many years.
[1:20:48.100 --> 1:20:50.100]  And he's been banned off PayPal.
[1:20:50.100 --> 1:20:52.100]  He's joining us next segment
[1:20:52.100 --> 1:20:54.100]  because this isn't just about censorship.
[1:20:54.100 --> 1:20:56.100]  It's about the total shutdown of society
[1:20:56.100 --> 1:20:59.100]  if you don't submit to the way they want you to behave.
[1:20:59.100 --> 1:21:01.100]  So Brandon Morrison isn't in Canada.
[1:21:01.100 --> 1:21:04.100]  He is a college student
[1:21:04.100 --> 1:21:06.100]  in Washington State,
[1:21:06.100 --> 1:21:08.100]  Instagram.
[1:21:08.100 --> 1:21:12.100]  It's radio and Snapchat.
[1:21:12.100 --> 1:21:14.100]  We'll put that up on screen for you
[1:21:14.100 --> 1:21:17.100]  so you can visit his contacts if you want.
[1:21:17.100 --> 1:21:20.100]  But you're hearing what it's like
[1:21:20.100 --> 1:21:22.100]  to grow up inside one of the famous
[1:21:22.100 --> 1:21:25.100]  communist socials families in Canada.
[1:21:25.100 --> 1:21:27.100]  But you were calling it yesterday
[1:21:27.100 --> 1:21:29.100]  just resonating with what
[1:21:29.100 --> 1:21:31.100]  Caitlin Bennett was going through
[1:21:31.100 --> 1:21:33.100]  at Ohio University
[1:21:33.100 --> 1:21:35.100]  with a crowd of 400 people
[1:21:35.100 --> 1:21:37.100]  just driving her off the campus
[1:21:37.100 --> 1:21:39.100]  because she was a Trump supporter
[1:21:39.100 --> 1:21:42.100]  trying to attack her and the press
[1:21:42.100 --> 1:21:44.100]  praising the whole thing.
[1:21:44.100 --> 1:21:48.100]  So how does this tie together for you?
[1:21:48.100 --> 1:21:51.100]  So it really is a crazy situation
[1:21:51.100 --> 1:21:54.100]  because you feel as though
[1:21:54.100 --> 1:21:56.100]  you're really behind enemy lines
[1:21:56.100 --> 1:21:58.100]  in this sort of situation.
[1:21:58.100 --> 1:22:00.100]  At least at my school,
[1:22:00.100 --> 1:22:03.100]  every first year student is required to
[1:22:03.100 --> 1:22:06.100]  take this class called College 101.
[1:22:06.100 --> 1:22:09.100]  And now you would think that
[1:22:09.100 --> 1:22:11.100]  the main purpose of this class
[1:22:11.100 --> 1:22:13.100]  is actually supposed to teach you
[1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:15.100]  how to be successful.
[1:22:15.100 --> 1:22:17.100]  That was maybe one week
[1:22:17.100 --> 1:22:19.100]  out of the 10 weeks that were in that class.
[1:22:19.100 --> 1:22:21.100]  The rest of it was
[1:22:21.100 --> 1:22:24.100]  it was really trying to brainwash us
[1:22:24.100 --> 1:22:26.100]  and make us feel as though
[1:22:26.100 --> 1:22:29.100]  we're guilty about being white
[1:22:29.100 --> 1:22:31.100]  or being men because
[1:22:31.100 --> 1:22:33.100]  they put us through the scenario where
[1:22:33.100 --> 1:22:35.100]  everybody in the class
[1:22:35.100 --> 1:22:37.100]  had to sit down and watch
[1:22:39.100 --> 1:22:42.100]  a news video called The Privilege Walk.
[1:22:42.100 --> 1:22:44.100]  That's just one example
[1:22:44.100 --> 1:22:47.100]  of many examples I can come up with.
[1:22:47.100 --> 1:22:51.100]  But this issue actually goes deeper than just college.
[1:22:51.100 --> 1:22:55.100]  There's examples I could pull from high school
[1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:57.100]  and even my brother's middle school.
[1:22:57.100 --> 1:23:00.100]  Any education system has been taken over
[1:23:00.100 --> 1:23:02.100]  by the communists and the globalists
[1:23:02.100 --> 1:23:04.100]  and it's all about you're bad because you're white,
[1:23:04.100 --> 1:23:05.100]  you're bad because you're American,
[1:23:05.100 --> 1:23:07.100]  you're bad because you're a veteran,
[1:23:07.100 --> 1:23:10.100]  you're bad because your dad or mother's a police officer.
[1:23:10.100 --> 1:23:12.100]  This is the most, beyond racism,
[1:23:12.100 --> 1:23:14.100]  it's beyond classism, it's communism
[1:23:14.100 --> 1:23:16.100]  saying you're a bad person,
[1:23:16.100 --> 1:23:18.100]  apologize for who you are
[1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:20.100]  and then learn to be a victim.
[1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:26.100]  And again, Brandon Morrison's Skype
[1:23:26.100 --> 1:23:28.100]  has been breaking up a bit.
[1:23:28.100 --> 1:23:31.100]  I want to go back to Adam, Harry, Cassidy here
[1:23:31.100 --> 1:23:33.100]  who grew up in a communist, famous communist home.
[1:23:33.100 --> 1:23:35.100]  Again, his dad had it up one of the main parties there,
[1:23:35.100 --> 1:23:37.100]  communist parties.
[1:23:37.100 --> 1:23:39.100]  You're hearing when he's talking about how
[1:23:39.100 --> 1:23:41.100]  they take over organizations,
[1:23:41.100 --> 1:23:43.100]  they hollow out groups
[1:23:43.100 --> 1:23:47.100]  and then you think it's the local school district
[1:23:47.100 --> 1:23:49.100]  but it's not, it's really the communist party.
[1:23:51.100 --> 1:23:53.100]  So...
[1:23:53.100 --> 1:23:58.100]  Like, it's like if you got into any,
[1:23:58.100 --> 1:24:00.100]  into the educational institutions
[1:24:00.100 --> 1:24:02.100]  and spread any philosophy,
[1:24:02.100 --> 1:24:04.100]  when those people came out into the world,
[1:24:04.100 --> 1:24:07.100]  it didn't really matter what system they occupied,
[1:24:07.100 --> 1:24:09.100]  that philosophy would become an effective
[1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:11.100]  international conspiracy.
[1:24:11.100 --> 1:24:13.100]  So it's like a cult without a,
[1:24:13.100 --> 1:24:15.100]  without a name or a charter or a head
[1:24:15.100 --> 1:24:17.100]  or a leader or a meeting.
[1:24:17.100 --> 1:24:21.100]  It's probably why McCarthy could never really find it, you know?
[1:24:21.100 --> 1:24:23.100]  So...
[1:24:23.100 --> 1:24:25.100]  It's a spiritual psychosis.
[1:24:25.100 --> 1:24:27.100]  I mean, how many, because they always say they're atheists
[1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:29.100]  but when you scratch the surface,
[1:24:29.100 --> 1:24:31.100]  they're all into the witchcraft or into the occult.
[1:24:31.100 --> 1:24:33.100]  They admit that the occult's exploding
[1:24:33.100 --> 1:24:35.100]  under the left, Satanism.
[1:24:35.100 --> 1:24:38.100]  I mean, did you ever run into that?
[1:24:38.100 --> 1:24:42.100]  Well, not so much, but, you know,
[1:24:42.100 --> 1:24:44.100]  I mean, look, Einstein said it himself,
[1:24:44.100 --> 1:24:47.100]  as heat is to cold, you know,
[1:24:47.100 --> 1:24:50.100]  an absence of God is the presence of Satan.
[1:24:50.100 --> 1:24:51.100]  So...
[1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:53.100]  Exactly.
[1:24:53.100 --> 1:24:56.100]  When you're inside this psychosis, it's like this.
[1:24:56.100 --> 1:24:58.100]  You, you believe that you're,
[1:24:58.100 --> 1:25:01.100]  not only your physical body is growing itself,
[1:25:01.100 --> 1:25:04.100]  but so is your, so that your hormones,
[1:25:04.100 --> 1:25:06.100]  we were expressly told that our hormones
[1:25:06.100 --> 1:25:09.100]  were going to start to kick in when we were about 12 years old
[1:25:09.100 --> 1:25:13.100]  and that these were going to physically turn us into adults.
[1:25:13.100 --> 1:25:15.100]  And that was a hard belief system
[1:25:15.100 --> 1:25:18.100]  and that was one of the things that I was fleeing
[1:25:18.100 --> 1:25:21.100]  was because I literally, at the age of 14,
[1:25:21.100 --> 1:25:23.100]  wasn't growing physically
[1:25:23.100 --> 1:25:26.100]  and certainly was not developing emotionally
[1:25:26.100 --> 1:25:28.100]  in that environment at all.
[1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:31.100]  You can tell people you have good genes to be big and strong,
[1:25:31.100 --> 1:25:33.100]  put them in a communist system,
[1:25:33.100 --> 1:25:35.100]  and spiritually they shrivel.
[1:25:35.100 --> 1:25:36.100]  They don't thrive.
[1:25:36.100 --> 1:25:37.100]  That's something I've picked up on as well.
[1:25:37.100 --> 1:25:38.100]  That's been written about.
[1:25:38.100 --> 1:25:41.100]  We've got Brandon Morrison's Skype working again.
[1:25:41.100 --> 1:25:43.100]  Brandon, getting back to what you were talking about,
[1:25:43.100 --> 1:25:46.100]  how the exact same thing Mr. Cassidy is saying
[1:25:46.100 --> 1:25:49.100]  is they seize all these institutions.
[1:25:49.100 --> 1:25:50.100]  Yeah.
[1:25:50.100 --> 1:25:52.100]  And, you know, it's almost,
[1:25:52.100 --> 1:25:55.100]  after what Mr. Cassidy was saying there
[1:25:55.100 --> 1:25:58.100]  about, like, not really developing,
[1:25:58.100 --> 1:26:01.100]  that's, it almost seems to be a way
[1:26:01.100 --> 1:26:02.100]  that they're able to grab control,
[1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:04.100]  not necessarily through physical development,
[1:26:04.100 --> 1:26:07.100]  but stunting the growth of your mind.
[1:26:07.100 --> 1:26:09.100]  Well, look at your Skype cut out again,
[1:26:09.100 --> 1:26:10.100]  so I'll interject.
[1:26:10.100 --> 1:26:12.100]  But yes, I'm going to hold you guys over.
[1:26:12.100 --> 1:26:17.100]  Look at how there's a rest of development in the left.
[1:26:17.100 --> 1:26:19.100]  And there's even big articles and studies
[1:26:19.100 --> 1:26:22.100]  that the left, a 25-year-old's like a 12-year-old.
[1:26:22.100 --> 1:26:24.100]  And then now they want to put little boys on hormones
[1:26:24.100 --> 1:26:25.100]  or cut their testicles off.
[1:26:25.100 --> 1:26:28.100]  So it is all about not just stunting them,
[1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:29.100]  but stealing the birthright,
[1:26:29.100 --> 1:26:33.100]  stealing the potential, stealing the destiny.
[1:26:33.100 --> 1:26:37.100]  Yeah, let's go back to Brandon real quick.
[1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:38.100]  We'll go back to Adam.
[1:26:38.100 --> 1:26:39.100]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[1:26:39.100 --> 1:26:40.100]  Yeah, so really quick.
[1:26:40.100 --> 1:26:43.100]  I want to talk about something that was happening
[1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:45.100]  at my brother's middle school.
[1:26:45.100 --> 1:26:56.100]  And it really, if this is because of Common Core
[1:26:56.100 --> 1:26:59.100]  or if it was because of just, like,
[1:26:59.100 --> 1:27:00.100]  the individual school itself.
[1:27:00.100 --> 1:27:03.100]  But there's this program called Checkology
[1:27:03.100 --> 1:27:04.100]  that he had to do.
[1:27:04.100 --> 1:27:07.100]  And what this is, is it's supposed to teach kids
[1:27:07.100 --> 1:27:09.100]  about fake news and fact-checking.
[1:27:09.100 --> 1:27:11.100]  And one of the big contributors to this.
[1:27:11.100 --> 1:27:12.100]  Now, that's nationwide.
[1:27:12.100 --> 1:27:13.100]  Bill and Molly Gates fund that.
[1:27:13.100 --> 1:27:14.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:27:14.100 --> 1:27:18.100]  But Bloomberg is also a part of this as well.
[1:27:18.100 --> 1:27:21.100]  And also, I decided to go through and check
[1:27:21.100 --> 1:27:23.100]  who else was contributing to this.
[1:27:23.100 --> 1:27:25.100]  Media Matters was in there.
[1:27:25.100 --> 1:27:29.100]  And just about every single other leftist institution
[1:27:29.100 --> 1:27:30.100]  that you can think of.
[1:27:30.100 --> 1:27:35.100]  So these are the people that we are letting into our schools.
[1:27:35.100 --> 1:27:37.100]  And it's like we're treating it as if it's just
[1:27:37.100 --> 1:27:39.100]  another daily thing.
[1:27:39.100 --> 1:27:40.100]  So my question is...
[1:27:40.100 --> 1:27:41.100]  You know, that's huge.
[1:27:41.100 --> 1:27:42.100]  Stop right there.
[1:27:42.100 --> 1:27:43.100]  Because parents can review a textbook.
[1:27:43.100 --> 1:27:44.100]  But now that it's all digital,
[1:27:44.100 --> 1:27:46.100]  that's how they're bringing it on the pedophilia
[1:27:46.100 --> 1:27:47.100]  of the sexualization.
[1:27:47.100 --> 1:27:50.100]  But exactly, that checkology with Bloomberg,
[1:27:50.100 --> 1:27:51.100]  Bill and Molly Gates.
[1:27:51.100 --> 1:27:54.100]  And as you said, Media Matters, I've seen that.
[1:27:54.100 --> 1:27:57.100]  Literally demonizing America, President Trump,
[1:27:57.100 --> 1:28:01.100]  the war of the UFO wars to little kids at middle school.
[1:28:01.100 --> 1:28:04.100]  So when we come back, let's talk about that
[1:28:04.100 --> 1:28:08.100]  with Brayden Morrison and Adam Harry Cassidy.
[1:28:08.100 --> 1:28:11.100]  And we also have a journalist joining us
[1:28:11.100 --> 1:28:13.100]  who has been persecuted for what he's doing.
[1:28:13.100 --> 1:28:16.100]  And of course, he's good friends with Roger Stone.
[1:28:16.100 --> 1:28:17.100]  Actually, Roger's confidant.
[1:28:17.100 --> 1:28:19.100]  Roger said this is the journalist to talk to
[1:28:19.100 --> 1:28:20.100]  when I'm silenced.
[1:28:20.100 --> 1:28:23.100]  So we're going to be talking to Jacob Ingalls
[1:28:23.100 --> 1:28:25.100]  of CentralFloridaPost.com.
[1:28:25.100 --> 1:28:27.100]  He's banned everywhere, including off PayPal.
[1:28:27.100 --> 1:28:31.100]  He's being punished for standing with America.
[1:28:31.100 --> 1:28:33.100]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[1:28:33.100 --> 1:28:35.100]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, newswars.com.
[1:28:35.100 --> 1:28:38.100]  Band.video, infowars.com.
[1:28:38.100 --> 1:28:40.100]  And you put a forward slash show on the end of that
[1:28:40.100 --> 1:28:42.100]  and it takes you to the verboten feeds,
[1:28:42.100 --> 1:28:44.100]  our own audio feeds, our own video feeds,
[1:28:44.100 --> 1:28:45.100]  our own satellite feeds,
[1:28:45.100 --> 1:28:47.100]  our own radio and TV stations that pick us up.
[1:28:47.100 --> 1:28:49.100]  However you're listening, spread the word.
[1:28:49.100 --> 1:28:56.100]  It's beyond critical.
[1:29:19.100 --> 1:29:21.100]  Or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[1:29:21.100 --> 1:29:50.100]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:52.100 --> 1:29:57.100]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[1:29:57.100 --> 1:29:59.100]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[1:29:59.100 --> 1:30:01.100]  Humanity's waking up to their tyranny,
[1:30:01.100 --> 1:30:04.100]  how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes,
[1:30:04.100 --> 1:30:06.100]  how they're building a post-human world.
[1:30:06.100 --> 1:30:08.100]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[1:30:08.100 --> 1:30:11.100]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely
[1:30:11.100 --> 1:30:13.100]  implode third-world countries
[1:30:13.100 --> 1:30:17.100]  and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes
[1:30:17.100 --> 1:30:19.100]  to come in and overwhelm the West
[1:30:19.100 --> 1:30:21.100]  and collapse our social services
[1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:23.100]  in a giant clowered and pivot program.
[1:30:23.100 --> 1:30:27.100]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues
[1:30:27.100 --> 1:30:29.100]  to make us capitulate to world government
[1:30:29.100 --> 1:30:31.100]  inner coronavirus.
[1:30:31.100 --> 1:30:33.100]  This is a critical year
[1:30:33.100 --> 1:30:36.100]  and it's a critical time to stay informed
[1:30:36.100 --> 1:30:38.100]  and to be spreading the word
[1:30:38.100 --> 1:30:40.100]  because people are waking up like never before.
[1:30:40.100 --> 1:30:43.100]  But this fight against tyranny is neck and neck,
[1:30:43.100 --> 1:30:46.100]  so spread the word about band.video
[1:30:46.100 --> 1:30:49.100]  and infullwars.com forward slash show.
[1:30:49.100 --> 1:30:51.100]  That is so important.
[1:30:51.100 --> 1:30:53.100]  You are at the center of the resistance.
[1:30:53.100 --> 1:30:55.100]  You are our only hope.
[1:30:57.100 --> 1:30:59.100]  All right, folks, here's the bad news.
[1:30:59.100 --> 1:31:02.100]  We've already sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle
[1:31:02.100 --> 1:31:04.100]  with the patented nanotech silver that's documented
[1:31:04.100 --> 1:31:06.100]  to knock out viruses and bacteria
[1:31:06.100 --> 1:31:08.100]  unlike anything else.
[1:31:08.100 --> 1:31:10.100]  But we do still have it in the 3-ounce
[1:31:10.100 --> 1:31:12.100]  and the 1-ounce for limited time.
[1:31:12.100 --> 1:31:14.100]  The good news is we have
[1:31:14.100 --> 1:31:16.100]  the super blue toothpaste
[1:31:16.100 --> 1:31:18.100]  and the super silver toothpaste,
[1:31:18.100 --> 1:31:20.100]  both that have the nano silver in them as well.
[1:31:20.100 --> 1:31:22.100]  The super blue has tea tree
[1:31:22.100 --> 1:31:24.100]  that's also antiviral and antibacterial
[1:31:24.100 --> 1:31:26.100]  and high-quality iodine.
[1:31:26.100 --> 1:31:29.100]  And then, of course, the whitening has the nano silver,
[1:31:29.100 --> 1:31:31.100]  but on top of that, it has the above-secral calcium
[1:31:31.100 --> 1:31:33.100]  that remelanorizes the teeth
[1:31:33.100 --> 1:31:36.100]  and so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[1:31:36.100 --> 1:31:38.100]  Period. It has the nano silver
[1:31:38.100 --> 1:31:40.100]  and we still have supplies of it, though it'll sell out
[1:31:40.100 --> 1:31:42.100]  at current rates in about two weeks,
[1:31:42.100 --> 1:31:44.100]  but despite that, I'm keeping it at sale
[1:31:44.100 --> 1:31:46.100]  at 50% off
[1:31:46.100 --> 1:31:48.100]  so everybody can protect themselves
[1:31:48.100 --> 1:31:50.100]  with this high-quality product.
[1:31:50.100 --> 1:31:52.100]  You've never used it before. Get yours today.
[1:31:52.100 --> 1:31:54.100]  Infowarsstore.com
[1:31:54.100 --> 1:31:56.100]  Infowarsstore.com
[1:31:56.100 --> 1:31:58.100]  Don't be a victim.
[1:31:58.100 --> 1:32:00.100]  If you're worried about the coronavirus,
[1:32:00.100 --> 1:32:02.100]  exercise, but not too hard
[1:32:02.100 --> 1:32:04.100]  because that can lower your immune system.
[1:32:04.100 --> 1:32:06.100]  Drink extra purified clean water
[1:32:06.100 --> 1:32:08.100]  so that no toxins weigh you down
[1:32:08.100 --> 1:32:10.100]  and you have plenty of hydration.
[1:32:10.100 --> 1:32:12.100]  You get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[1:32:12.100 --> 1:32:14.100]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[1:32:14.100 --> 1:32:16.100]  That's what allows you to be healthier
[1:32:16.100 --> 1:32:18.100]  and get plenty of sleep.
[1:32:18.100 --> 1:32:20.100]  We have sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle
[1:32:20.100 --> 1:32:22.100]  that has the nano silver
[1:32:22.100 --> 1:32:24.100]  that Pat did and documented and even admitted
[1:32:24.100 --> 1:32:26.100]  and documents we've shown to go after this whole corona
[1:32:26.100 --> 1:32:28.100]  SARS family. A virus.
[1:32:28.100 --> 1:32:30.100]  We're almost sold out of the 1-ounce spray bottles.
[1:32:30.100 --> 1:32:32.100]  That'll be sold out a couple days
[1:32:32.100 --> 1:32:34.100]  and we're in about a week and a half or so
[1:32:34.100 --> 1:32:36.100]  of the super silver 3-ounce bottles.
[1:32:36.100 --> 1:32:38.100]  Great to have, period. Really good for your gums.
[1:32:38.100 --> 1:32:40.100]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[1:32:40.100 --> 1:32:42.100]  Again, we're the only folks
[1:32:42.100 --> 1:32:44.100]  who like to private label or make our own products
[1:32:44.100 --> 1:32:46.100]  with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[1:32:46.100 --> 1:32:48.100]  that's in only some of the security documents and everything
[1:32:48.100 --> 1:32:50.100]  because we get the best stuff and there's a lot of patriots.
[1:32:50.100 --> 1:32:52.100]  There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[1:32:52.100 --> 1:32:54.100]  There's the flip side of all the good guys
[1:32:54.100 --> 1:33:12.100]  that's very exciting.
[1:33:12.100 --> 1:33:28.100]  2,020 is a crazy year.
[1:33:28.100 --> 1:33:30.100]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:33:30.100 --> 1:33:32.100]  You don't need me to tell you that to know it's serious.
[1:33:32.100 --> 1:33:34.100]  And you want to be sitting on top
[1:33:34.100 --> 1:33:36.100]  of your storeable food.
[1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:38.100]  You want to be sitting on top of your firearms,
[1:33:38.100 --> 1:33:40.100]  your ammunition.
[1:33:40.100 --> 1:33:42.100]  You're sitting on top right next to neighbors
[1:33:42.100 --> 1:33:44.100]  and friends and family you can trust.
[1:33:44.100 --> 1:33:46.100]  That's the best asset in a crazy time.
[1:33:46.100 --> 1:33:48.100]  We know the globalists are throwing a lot of curveballs out there
[1:33:48.100 --> 1:33:50.100]  so now's the time to be prepared.
[1:33:50.100 --> 1:33:52.100]  And I can tell you,
[1:33:52.100 --> 1:33:54.100]  our big food suppliers,
[1:33:54.100 --> 1:33:56.100]  one of the only major food suppliers out there
[1:33:56.100 --> 1:33:58.100]  that still has food and they've got the best high quality food
[1:33:58.100 --> 1:34:00.100]  for the best price you're going to find.
[1:34:00.100 --> 1:34:02.100]  That's why they've been our sponsor for almost 11 years.
[1:34:02.100 --> 1:34:04.100]  They're only 12 years old.
[1:34:04.100 --> 1:34:06.100]  But they were part of a larger group that wanted to do them better.
[1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:08.100]  They broke off to their own group, became a sponsor.
[1:34:08.100 --> 1:34:10.100]  I wanted people that got high quality food
[1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:12.100]  to people with great prices.
[1:34:12.100 --> 1:34:14.100]  I wanted to have a relationship.
[1:34:14.100 --> 1:34:16.100]  I didn't want five or six food sponsors.
[1:34:16.100 --> 1:34:18.100]  I wanted to have the best just like we do
[1:34:18.100 --> 1:34:20.100]  with the water filtration, air filtration, all of it.
[1:34:20.100 --> 1:34:22.100]  And we do.
[1:34:22.100 --> 1:34:24.100]  I've been talking to them.
[1:34:24.100 --> 1:34:26.100]  They're like, it's still 10 to 14 days.
[1:34:26.100 --> 1:34:28.100]  We have the food for another three, four weeks out.
[1:34:28.100 --> 1:34:30.100]  We're buying more.
[1:34:30.100 --> 1:34:32.100]  But we're going 24 hours a day to ship it.
[1:34:32.100 --> 1:34:34.100]  This virus looks really bad.
[1:34:34.100 --> 1:34:36.100]  And I guess go ahead
[1:34:36.100 --> 1:34:38.100]  and tell people that in a few weeks
[1:34:38.100 --> 1:34:40.100]  it might go out to 20 days.
[1:34:40.100 --> 1:34:42.100]  You've got to wait.
[1:34:42.100 --> 1:34:44.100]  But if you get your order in now, you won't have to.
[1:34:44.100 --> 1:34:46.100]  And obviously, I've given us a rest from the virus.
[1:34:46.100 --> 1:34:48.100]  It's even more insane breaking news today.
[1:34:48.100 --> 1:34:50.100]  It's just completely out of control.
[1:34:50.100 --> 1:34:52.100]  Hit some of that next hour.
[1:34:52.100 --> 1:34:54.100]  Paul Watson is doing the fourth hour.
[1:34:54.100 --> 1:34:56.100]  But in FullWareStore.com, you go there.
[1:34:56.100 --> 1:34:58.100]  My Patreon's been partnered up with us for many years.
[1:34:58.100 --> 1:35:00.100]  They're in our server and they take the orders out
[1:35:00.100 --> 1:35:02.100]  and they go right to the front of the line
[1:35:02.100 --> 1:35:04.100]  as your order comes in.
[1:35:04.100 --> 1:35:06.100]  They're out of the nano silver patented
[1:35:08.100 --> 1:35:10.100]  3.4 ounce and 1 ounce bottles
[1:35:10.100 --> 1:35:12.100]  we sold out of the 16 ounce.
[1:35:12.100 --> 1:35:14.100]  That's at FullWareStore.com.
[1:35:14.100 --> 1:35:16.100]  Vitamin refusions back in stock. It's amazing.
[1:35:16.100 --> 1:35:18.100]  SHOW is Ultra 12.
[1:35:18.100 --> 1:35:20.100]  It's the best B12 we're going to find out there sublingually.
[1:35:20.100 --> 1:35:22.100]  They're both 40% off, 50% off.
[1:35:22.100 --> 1:35:24.100]  You get them together at FullWareStore.com.
[1:35:24.100 --> 1:35:26.100]  And of course, the nano patented silver
[1:35:26.100 --> 1:35:28.100]  is also in the super silver
[1:35:28.100 --> 1:35:30.100]  tooth whitening toothpaste and super blue
[1:35:30.100 --> 1:35:32.100]  fluoride free toothpaste
[1:35:32.100 --> 1:35:34.100]  as well with the tea tree oil
[1:35:34.100 --> 1:35:36.100]  and iodine.
[1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:38.100]  So be sure and check out both of those, the super blue
[1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:40.100]  and the super silver.
[1:35:40.100 --> 1:35:42.100]  All right, joining us and then our other
[1:35:42.100 --> 1:35:44.100]  callers will pop back in next segment
[1:35:44.100 --> 1:35:46.100]  because I want to have them finish up what they're talking about
[1:35:46.100 --> 1:35:48.100]  and get more into how media matters.
[1:35:48.100 --> 1:35:50.100]  And Bloomberg,
[1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:52.100]  got a whole stack of news actually, pulled it up right here.
[1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:54.100]  Bloomberg's funding your local education
[1:35:54.100 --> 1:35:56.100]  and he wants your guns.
[1:35:56.100 --> 1:35:58.100]  And he's funding prosecutors. Did you know that?
[1:35:58.100 --> 1:36:00.100]  Yeah, we'll tell you about that next segment.
[1:36:00.100 --> 1:36:02.100]  But I wanted to get Jacob Engels on
[1:36:02.100 --> 1:36:04.100]  because he's a great
[1:36:04.100 --> 1:36:06.100]  reporter and a confidant of Roger Stone.
[1:36:06.100 --> 1:36:08.100]  Roger said this is the reporter to talk to.
[1:36:08.100 --> 1:36:10.100]  We've been wanting to get him on for the last week.
[1:36:10.100 --> 1:36:12.100]  Here he is, CentralFloridaPost.com
[1:36:12.100 --> 1:36:14.100]  kicked off PayPal now, not just
[1:36:14.100 --> 1:36:16.100]  he platformed everywhere, but because
[1:36:16.100 --> 1:36:18.100]  you just do honest, decent, not even
[1:36:18.100 --> 1:36:20.100]  flamboyant reporting like I do.
[1:36:20.100 --> 1:36:22.100]  I mean, you're not even a
[1:36:22.100 --> 1:36:24.100]  Gonzo journalist, dude. You're just like really
[1:36:24.100 --> 1:36:26.100]  doing decent reporting for many years.
[1:36:26.100 --> 1:36:28.100]  You've now been kicked off PayPal. This is so dangerous.
[1:36:28.100 --> 1:36:30.100]  No, no, it's absolutely
[1:36:30.100 --> 1:36:32.100]  out of control, Alex.
[1:36:32.100 --> 1:36:34.100]  And actually, they kicked me off of PayPal
[1:36:34.100 --> 1:36:36.100]  a couple of months ago as
[1:36:36.100 --> 1:36:38.100]  Hurricane Dorian was making landfall
[1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:40.100]  in Florida. So what if
[1:36:40.100 --> 1:36:42.100]  that was my only source of
[1:36:42.100 --> 1:36:44.100]  accessing money? What if I ran an online store
[1:36:44.100 --> 1:36:46.100]  and merchandise or was doing something
[1:36:46.100 --> 1:36:48.100]  like that or accepted payments
[1:36:48.100 --> 1:36:50.100]  from my clients or business
[1:36:50.100 --> 1:36:52.100]  associates through PayPal and
[1:36:52.100 --> 1:36:54.100]  a hurricane is hitting and what if my power
[1:36:54.100 --> 1:36:56.100]  went out? What if I didn't have food? What if I need
[1:36:56.100 --> 1:36:58.100]  to go get water? The left are
[1:36:58.100 --> 1:37:00.100]  racketeering and out of control.
[1:37:00.100 --> 1:37:02.100]  Absolutely.
[1:37:02.100 --> 1:37:04.100]  110%.
[1:37:04.100 --> 1:37:06.100]  And they, it's not enough to demean us.
[1:37:06.100 --> 1:37:08.100]  It's not enough to destroy our reputations.
[1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:10.100]  It's not enough to shame us, to assault
[1:37:10.100 --> 1:37:12.100]  us, to spit on us, to throw milkshake.
[1:37:12.100 --> 1:37:14.100]  They want us
[1:37:14.100 --> 1:37:16.100]  broke. They want us dead.
[1:37:16.100 --> 1:37:18.100]  What did you make
[1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:20.100]  of Caitlyn Bennett two days ago
[1:37:20.100 --> 1:37:22.100]  at Ohio University peacefully doing a
[1:37:22.100 --> 1:37:24.100]  President's Day interview in a mob of
[1:37:24.100 --> 1:37:26.100]  hundred attacked or ran her off campus
[1:37:26.100 --> 1:37:28.100]  and newspapers everywhere celebrated it.
[1:37:28.100 --> 1:37:30.100]  It really
[1:37:30.100 --> 1:37:32.100]  looked like a cult to me.
[1:37:32.100 --> 1:37:34.100]  It looked like a cult. I don't know what's going
[1:37:34.100 --> 1:37:36.100]  on on that campus. Where were the campus police?
[1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:38.100]  Where were the local county or city police?
[1:37:38.100 --> 1:37:40.100]  And then what the heck
[1:37:40.100 --> 1:37:42.100]  is going on with the
[1:37:42.100 --> 1:37:44.100]  faculty and the professors at that college?
[1:37:44.100 --> 1:37:46.100]  They were participating.
[1:37:46.100 --> 1:37:48.100]  Let's talk about Roger.
[1:37:48.100 --> 1:37:50.100]  He will not even talk
[1:37:50.100 --> 1:37:52.100]  to me in the last few months from last month
[1:37:52.100 --> 1:37:54.100]  and understand other than
[1:37:54.100 --> 1:37:56.100]  getting messages, date. Don't talk about my case.
[1:37:56.100 --> 1:37:58.100]  Well, I'm sorry, Roger. I'm a citizen.
[1:37:58.100 --> 1:38:00.100]  I've been attacked by this judge in the hearings.
[1:38:00.100 --> 1:38:02.100]  They're trying to extend the
[1:38:02.100 --> 1:38:04.100]  gag order where no one in the country can
[1:38:04.100 --> 1:38:06.100]  talk about it or Roger is punished.
[1:38:06.100 --> 1:38:08.100]  And I'm not bowed to Hillary Clinton wanting
[1:38:08.100 --> 1:38:10.100]  to have me killed. So I love Roger to death.
[1:38:10.100 --> 1:38:12.100]  He's an innocent man. I hope at the sentencing tomorrow
[1:38:12.100 --> 1:38:14.100]  they do the right thing and say
[1:38:14.100 --> 1:38:16.100]  time served or whatever or Trump's going to have
[1:38:16.100 --> 1:38:18.100]  to pardon. He's signaled he will, but
[1:38:18.100 --> 1:38:20.100]  just
[1:38:20.100 --> 1:38:22.100]  how's Roger doing just
[1:38:22.100 --> 1:38:24.100]  in his spirits? How's his health? I mean, we're
[1:38:24.100 --> 1:38:26.100]  allowed. Is he alive?
[1:38:26.100 --> 1:38:28.100]  I mean, we're allowed to ask certain questions here.
[1:38:28.100 --> 1:38:30.100]  I know that this judge is God on earth, but
[1:38:30.100 --> 1:38:32.100]  well, Alex,
[1:38:32.100 --> 1:38:34.100]  Roger, like you,
[1:38:34.100 --> 1:38:36.100]  like so many of the people watching is
[1:38:36.100 --> 1:38:38.100]  a strong,
[1:38:38.100 --> 1:38:40.100]  dedicated individual
[1:38:40.100 --> 1:38:42.100]  to liberty and freedom. He's had
[1:38:42.100 --> 1:38:44.100]  a lot thrown at him and I have not
[1:38:44.100 --> 1:38:46.100]  seen his spirit broken. I have not seen
[1:38:46.100 --> 1:38:48.100]  him slow down. I have not seen him have
[1:38:48.100 --> 1:38:50.100]  any type of health issue. He's
[1:38:50.100 --> 1:38:52.100]  stronger and
[1:38:52.100 --> 1:38:54.100]  more motivated than ever to fight for this movement
[1:38:54.100 --> 1:38:56.100]  and to fight for this president. But
[1:38:56.100 --> 1:38:58.100]  if you remember a couple of months ago when
[1:38:58.100 --> 1:39:00.100]  we were reporting on the tainted
[1:39:00.100 --> 1:39:02.100]  bias jury pool, you remember that
[1:39:02.100 --> 1:39:04.100]  this judge
[1:39:04.100 --> 1:39:06.100]  come to find out
[1:39:06.100 --> 1:39:08.100]  ordered a sealed
[1:39:08.100 --> 1:39:10.100]  a sealed order of contempt after
[1:39:10.100 --> 1:39:12.100]  we reported on that news
[1:39:12.100 --> 1:39:14.100]  and on that juror that was all over Twitter anyways.
[1:39:14.100 --> 1:39:16.100]  And if I had gone into the courtroom, the next issue
[1:39:16.100 --> 1:39:18.100]  is going to have me jailed for daring to call
[1:39:18.100 --> 1:39:20.100]  out jury bias. That's right. The Washington Post called
[1:39:20.100 --> 1:39:22.100]  for my arrest and your arrest
[1:39:22.100 --> 1:39:24.100]  and had former U.S. attorneys calling
[1:39:24.100 --> 1:39:26.100]  for our arrest on the front
[1:39:26.100 --> 1:39:28.100]  of the Washington Post. That's who these people are.
[1:39:28.100 --> 1:39:30.100]  And it turns out we were right about these jurors being
[1:39:30.100 --> 1:39:32.100]  Democratic operatives and it's in the Constitution
[1:39:32.100 --> 1:39:34.100]  and Supreme Court rulings that what we did
[1:39:34.100 --> 1:39:36.100]  was totally legal.
[1:39:36.100 --> 1:39:38.100]  It was, it was, it was
[1:39:38.100 --> 1:39:40.100]  totally within the law. And first of all,
[1:39:40.100 --> 1:39:42.100]  it's about holding truth to power
[1:39:42.100 --> 1:39:44.100]  just because you put on that black robe
[1:39:44.100 --> 1:39:46.100]  and think that you have a lifetime appointment.
[1:39:46.100 --> 1:39:48.100]  You can be held accountable
[1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:50.100]  and you should be held accountable.
[1:39:50.100 --> 1:39:52.100]  You are not God. You are not above any other
[1:39:52.100 --> 1:39:54.100]  human. That black robe
[1:39:54.100 --> 1:39:56.100]  is meaningless. And with the way
[1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:58.100]  that she's treating her
[1:39:58.100 --> 1:40:00.100]  courtroom and the way that she's
[1:40:00.100 --> 1:40:02.100]  behaving, it really is just kind of
[1:40:02.100 --> 1:40:04.100]  bastardizing and she's, she's bringing shame
[1:40:04.100 --> 1:40:06.100]  on the court.
[1:40:06.100 --> 1:40:08.100]  You're going to be covering it in D.C.
[1:40:08.100 --> 1:40:10.100]  So is O.M. tomorrow.
[1:40:10.100 --> 1:40:12.100]  Gut level, what do you think is about to happen?
[1:40:12.100 --> 1:40:14.100]  I think it's
[1:40:14.100 --> 1:40:16.100]  very unlikely that this judge
[1:40:16.100 --> 1:40:18.100]  is going to admit wrongdoing.
[1:40:18.100 --> 1:40:20.100]  That she's going to admit something happened
[1:40:20.100 --> 1:40:22.100]  in her courtroom that she allowed
[1:40:22.100 --> 1:40:24.100]  that was illegal and improper.
[1:40:24.100 --> 1:40:26.100]  She hasn't shown any history
[1:40:26.100 --> 1:40:28.100]  or pattern of remorse
[1:40:28.100 --> 1:40:30.100]  or even fairness.
[1:40:30.100 --> 1:40:32.100]  Do you think she doubles down?
[1:40:32.100 --> 1:40:34.100]  I think she doubles down.
[1:40:34.100 --> 1:40:36.100]  I mean, do you really think this Obama
[1:40:36.100 --> 1:40:38.100]  appointed judge is going to sit there and say,
[1:40:38.100 --> 1:40:40.100]  oh, I made a mistake? No.
[1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:42.100]  No, this area has been
[1:40:42.100 --> 1:40:44.100]  nothing but belligerent to Trump,
[1:40:44.100 --> 1:40:46.100]  even though they've been overturned unanimously
[1:40:46.100 --> 1:40:48.100]  by the Supreme Court.
[1:40:48.100 --> 1:40:50.100]  Yep, yep.
[1:40:50.100 --> 1:40:52.100]  And this Obama appointed judge
[1:40:52.100 --> 1:40:54.100]  really needs to consider what she's about
[1:40:54.100 --> 1:40:56.100]  to do because I think it puts her
[1:40:56.100 --> 1:40:58.100]  at risk legally with her job
[1:40:58.100 --> 1:41:00.100]  because she made orders
[1:41:00.100 --> 1:41:02.100]  in that court. Don't go on social media.
[1:41:02.100 --> 1:41:04.100]  Don't post about the case. The jury
[1:41:04.100 --> 1:41:06.100]  foreman was on social media posting
[1:41:06.100 --> 1:41:08.100]  about the case before the case was over.
[1:41:08.100 --> 1:41:10.100]  That in and of itself requires attention.
[1:41:10.100 --> 1:41:12.100]  And if that judge doesn't address that,
[1:41:12.100 --> 1:41:14.100]  is she really
[1:41:14.100 --> 1:41:16.100]  abiding by the laws and rules
[1:41:16.100 --> 1:41:18.100]  that she set forth? No, you're right.
[1:41:18.100 --> 1:41:20.100]  She should declare a mistrial now
[1:41:20.100 --> 1:41:22.100]  because we've got all the court cases.
[1:41:22.100 --> 1:41:24.100]  I've had all these top lawyers calling on.
[1:41:24.100 --> 1:41:26.100]  Look at this court case. If the juror
[1:41:26.100 --> 1:41:28.100]  comments on social media about anything
[1:41:28.100 --> 1:41:30.100]  they're out, well, she was commenting about
[1:41:30.100 --> 1:41:32.100]  Trump and Stone. The foreman was.
[1:41:32.100 --> 1:41:34.100]  It's they're done.
[1:41:34.100 --> 1:41:36.100]  Yeah, no. And this juror, Alex,
[1:41:36.100 --> 1:41:38.100]  she she's saying, oh, I don't watch C
[1:41:38.100 --> 1:41:40.100]  span. Oh, I don't do this. I don't do that.
[1:41:40.100 --> 1:41:42.100]  She she said about a dozen things
[1:41:42.100 --> 1:41:44.100]  that she didn't do or she didn't know about.
[1:41:44.100 --> 1:41:46.100]  And then you go and look on her on her Twitter
[1:41:46.100 --> 1:41:48.100]  and Facebook accounts and it is just
[1:41:48.100 --> 1:41:50.100]  rife with
[1:41:50.100 --> 1:41:52.100]  postings and content that she claimed
[1:41:52.100 --> 1:41:54.100]  she never knew about or never
[1:41:54.100 --> 1:41:56.100]  posted. That's why the judge kept saying
[1:41:56.100 --> 1:41:58.100]  don't out the jurors. It's like, don't out
[1:41:58.100 --> 1:42:00.100]  the whistleblower, even though you're supposed to face
[1:42:00.100 --> 1:42:02.100]  your kid because they're all a bunch of flaming
[1:42:02.100 --> 1:42:04.100]  liberals.
[1:42:04.100 --> 1:42:06.100]  Yeah, and media matters and everyone, they lost
[1:42:06.100 --> 1:42:08.100]  their mind when we are just trying to
[1:42:08.100 --> 1:42:10.100]  evaluate what was going on in that courtroom
[1:42:10.100 --> 1:42:12.100]  with this jury selection process. They called
[1:42:12.100 --> 1:42:14.100]  for our arrest. Some of them wanted even worse
[1:42:14.100 --> 1:42:16.100]  to happen to us. And then look,
[1:42:16.100 --> 1:42:18.100]  we're right again. This was a
[1:42:18.100 --> 1:42:20.100]  painted jury and it needs
[1:42:20.100 --> 1:42:22.100]  to be declared a mistrial
[1:42:22.100 --> 1:42:24.100]  or Trump just needs to pardon him right now
[1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:26.100]  and end the kangaroo court.
[1:42:26.100 --> 1:42:28.100]  Well, I appreciate you having the courage to come
[1:42:28.100 --> 1:42:30.100]  on. Nobody else does. If you
[1:42:30.100 --> 1:42:32.100]  talk to Roger, tell him I said hi. He won't even
[1:42:32.100 --> 1:42:34.100]  talk to me other than saying, please don't
[1:42:34.100 --> 1:42:36.100]  talk about the case in any way. Well, I mean,
[1:42:36.100 --> 1:42:38.100]  how am I not, because
[1:42:38.100 --> 1:42:40.100]  he gets blamed when I talk about it. It's not
[1:42:40.100 --> 1:42:42.100]  Roger telling me what to say. I mean,
[1:42:42.100 --> 1:42:44.100]  I'm a news person. I'm covering
[1:42:44.100 --> 1:42:46.100]  a big famous trial here.
[1:42:46.100 --> 1:42:48.100]  Listen, please come back on
[1:42:48.100 --> 1:42:50.100]  tomorrow, Jacob Engels, CentralFloridaPost.com.
[1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:52.100]  You'll come on tomorrow?
[1:42:52.100 --> 1:42:54.100]  Yes, sir, absolutely. Thank you, sir.
[1:42:54.100 --> 1:42:56.100]  Send us in tomorrow.
[1:42:56.100 --> 1:42:58.100]  Three weeks ago, we told you
[1:42:58.100 --> 1:43:00.100]  that the Pentagon had set up secret
[1:43:00.100 --> 1:43:02.100]  quarantine centers for the coronavirus
[1:43:02.100 --> 1:43:04.100]  and that they believed it was much more serious
[1:43:04.100 --> 1:43:06.100]  than we were being told. Now we know
[1:43:06.100 --> 1:43:08.100]  that that is the case. And we know the federal
[1:43:08.100 --> 1:43:10.100]  government and major corporations have been
[1:43:10.100 --> 1:43:12.100]  buying up all the major storable food
[1:43:12.100 --> 1:43:14.100]  supplies around the country. Almost everyone
[1:43:14.100 --> 1:43:16.100]  else is sold out. But our supplier,
[1:43:16.100 --> 1:43:18.100]  my patriot,
[1:43:18.100 --> 1:43:20.100]  infowarstore.com still has their

[1:43:24.100 --> 1:43:26.100]  That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it
[1:43:26.100 --> 1:43:28.100]  to get delivered. Not because they don't have the food,
[1:43:28.100 --> 1:43:30.100]  not because they've got to package it,
[1:43:30.100 --> 1:43:32.100]  and their factories are going 24 hours a day.
[1:43:32.100 --> 1:43:34.100]  High quality fresh food,

[1:44:24.100 --> 1:44:26.100]  Since the beginning,
[1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:28.100]  Seeker 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[1:44:28.100 --> 1:44:30.100]  Now we're bringing you an all-new version
[1:44:30.100 --> 1:44:32.100]  of your favorite formula
[1:44:32.100 --> 1:44:34.100]  to help you reach your energy peak.
[1:44:34.100 --> 1:44:36.100]  Ultra 12 from Infowars Life
[1:44:36.100 --> 1:44:38.100]  takes advantage of the most effective
[1:44:38.100 --> 1:44:40.100]  and expensive form of B12 available,
[1:44:40.100 --> 1:44:42.100]  Methicobolamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[1:44:42.100 --> 1:44:44.100]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA,
[1:44:44.100 --> 1:44:46.100]  support the body's energy production,

[1:44:48.100 --> 1:44:50.100]  while assisting proper nervous system function.
[1:44:50.100 --> 1:44:52.100]  Help support your energy levels

[1:44:54.100 --> 1:45:20.100]  of B12.
[1:45:20.100 --> 1:45:24.100]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[1:45:24.100 --> 1:45:26.100]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[1:45:26.100 --> 1:45:28.100]  The globalists are trying to create
[1:45:28.100 --> 1:45:30.100]  economic collapse, race riots.
[1:45:30.100 --> 1:45:32.100]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[1:45:32.100 --> 1:45:34.100]  That's why listeners to Infowars
[1:45:34.100 --> 1:45:36.100]  need to be prepared.
[1:45:36.100 --> 1:45:38.100]  Infowarsstore.com

[1:45:40.100 --> 1:45:42.100]  better and make you healthier.

[1:45:44.100 --> 1:45:46.100]  selling out as we speak.
[1:45:46.100 --> 1:45:48.100]  We have high-quality, storable foods
[1:45:48.100 --> 1:45:50.100]  that are ready to ship,
[1:45:50.100 --> 1:45:52.100]  and vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock
[1:45:52.100 --> 1:45:54.100]  along with Ultra 12
[1:45:54.100 --> 1:45:56.100]  at Infowarsstore.com
[1:45:56.100 --> 1:45:58.100]  Across the western world,
[1:45:58.100 --> 1:46:00.100]  from high school
[1:46:00.100 --> 1:46:02.100]  to college sports to even the Olympics,
[1:46:02.100 --> 1:46:04.100]  men, biological men
[1:46:04.100 --> 1:46:06.100]  are winning
[1:46:06.100 --> 1:46:08.100]  almost all of the sporting events.
[1:46:08.100 --> 1:46:10.100]  This is men invading
[1:46:10.100 --> 1:46:12.100]  women's spaces and bullying them
[1:46:12.100 --> 1:46:14.100]  and taking their rights away.
[1:46:14.100 --> 1:46:16.100]  All in the name of the liberalism
[1:46:16.100 --> 1:46:18.100]  and openness, and that every day
[1:46:18.100 --> 1:46:20.100]  I have stacks of news articles
[1:46:20.100 --> 1:46:22.100]  just like today, UK team
[1:46:22.100 --> 1:46:24.100]  fined under house arrest
[1:46:24.100 --> 1:46:26.100]  for asking trans police officers
[1:46:26.100 --> 1:46:28.100]  gender and it hurt their feelings.
[1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:30.100]  UK mother spared jail
[1:46:30.100 --> 1:46:32.100]  for misgendering trans woman
[1:46:32.100 --> 1:46:34.100]  ordered to pay 1,000 pound
[1:46:34.100 --> 1:46:36.100]  fine because it could have caused
[1:46:36.100 --> 1:46:38.100]  anxiety in the new
[1:46:38.100 --> 1:46:40.100]  royalty.
[1:46:40.100 --> 1:46:42.100]  That's the thought police.
[1:46:42.100 --> 1:46:44.100]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason
[1:46:44.100 --> 1:46:46.100]  you get fined and you go to jail.
[1:46:46.100 --> 1:46:48.100]  This is tyranny.
[1:46:48.100 --> 1:46:50.100]  These people are bullies and it's sick
[1:46:50.100 --> 1:46:52.100]  and it's evil and it's part of a scientific
[1:46:52.100 --> 1:46:54.100]  anti-human takeover.
[1:46:54.100 --> 1:47:16.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:16.100 --> 1:47:28.100]  I've really been seeking God's face.
[1:47:28.100 --> 1:47:30.100]  Because I want to be given peace
[1:47:30.100 --> 1:47:32.100]  that quiet place the most high
[1:47:32.100 --> 1:47:34.100]  that King David talked about.
[1:47:34.100 --> 1:47:36.100]  I need to be given that peace
[1:47:36.100 --> 1:47:38.100]  or I'm going to be just torn apart
[1:47:38.100 --> 1:47:40.100]  by the fact that I do care.
[1:47:40.100 --> 1:47:42.100]  I don't say that to virtue signal.
[1:47:42.100 --> 1:47:44.100]  I do care.
[1:47:44.100 --> 1:47:46.100]  I care from a very
[1:47:46.100 --> 1:47:48.100]  territorial position
[1:47:48.100 --> 1:47:50.100]  of people wanting to dominate us
[1:47:50.100 --> 1:47:52.100]  and make us slaves so they can control us.
[1:47:52.100 --> 1:47:54.100]  Not from some
[1:47:54.100 --> 1:47:56.100]  I'm so good.
[1:47:56.100 --> 1:47:58.100]  No, I'm wicked and hateful and destructive
[1:47:58.100 --> 1:48:00.100]  and I will destroy people
[1:48:00.100 --> 1:48:02.100]  that are corrupt.
[1:48:02.100 --> 1:48:04.100]  But I don't have a will to dominate
[1:48:04.100 --> 1:48:06.100]  innocents and children.
[1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:08.100]  And that's my problem is
[1:48:08.100 --> 1:48:10.100]  I'm not Christ's leg.
[1:48:10.100 --> 1:48:12.100]  I'm not Christ's leg. I don't want to turn
[1:48:12.100 --> 1:48:14.100]  I want to
[1:48:14.100 --> 1:48:16.100]  literally tear the heads off of the people
[1:48:16.100 --> 1:48:18.100]  that are attacking us.
[1:48:18.100 --> 1:48:20.100]  I understand why the Bible says
[1:48:20.100 --> 1:48:22.100]  we need to be controlled and loving and peaceful
[1:48:22.100 --> 1:48:24.100]  because then you can go in
[1:48:24.100 --> 1:48:26.100]  not like the psychopaths or sociopaths
[1:48:26.100 --> 1:48:28.100]  from a cold-blooded perspective
[1:48:28.100 --> 1:48:30.100]  but from just a controlled perspective.
[1:48:30.100 --> 1:48:32.100]  You have the spirit.
[1:48:32.100 --> 1:48:34.100]  You have the justice. You have the freedom.
[1:48:34.100 --> 1:48:36.100]  You care. But you're able to take control
[1:48:36.100 --> 1:48:38.100]  and then execute what you have to do.
[1:48:38.100 --> 1:48:40.100]  And I have not gotten to that point yet.
[1:48:40.100 --> 1:48:42.100]  I constantly try
[1:48:42.100 --> 1:48:44.100]  because
[1:48:44.100 --> 1:48:46.100]  I want to be able to cut myself off
[1:48:46.100 --> 1:48:48.100]  from these people while I fight them
[1:48:48.100 --> 1:48:50.100]  because it's sick. I don't want to hate them.
[1:48:50.100 --> 1:48:52.100]  That almost gives them energy.
[1:48:52.100 --> 1:48:54.100]  I want to just see them as a disease
[1:48:54.100 --> 1:48:56.100]  or an infestation to be cut out
[1:48:56.100 --> 1:48:58.100]  and dealt with
[1:48:58.100 --> 1:49:00.100]  not to get so angry at them
[1:49:00.100 --> 1:49:02.100]  and get on their level.
[1:49:02.100 --> 1:49:04.100]  And so I'm working on doing that
[1:49:04.100 --> 1:49:06.100]  because it's unhealthy
[1:49:06.100 --> 1:49:08.100]  to hate these people.
[1:49:08.100 --> 1:49:10.100]  I'm
[1:49:10.100 --> 1:49:12.100]  powered by love of justice
[1:49:12.100 --> 1:49:14.100]  but then it
[1:49:14.100 --> 1:49:16.100]  the byproduct is I do hate these people.
[1:49:16.100 --> 1:49:18.100]  I hate them a great deal.
[1:49:18.100 --> 1:49:20.100]  But I'm more frustrated that they're able
[1:49:20.100 --> 1:49:22.100]  to dominate us when they're so obviously
[1:49:22.100 --> 1:49:24.100]  evil. But you have to understand
[1:49:24.100 --> 1:49:26.100]  they've been divorced from God
[1:49:26.100 --> 1:49:28.100]  from whatever happened when they were children
[1:49:28.100 --> 1:49:30.100]  whatever happened genetically, what happened spiritually
[1:49:30.100 --> 1:49:32.100]  that we need to just
[1:49:32.100 --> 1:49:34.100]  somehow transcend the enemy.
[1:49:34.100 --> 1:49:36.100]  Expose them, resist them
[1:49:36.100 --> 1:49:38.100]  love justice and love God
[1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:40.100]  and make our lives about beauty
[1:49:40.100 --> 1:49:42.100]  and communing with God
[1:49:42.100 --> 1:49:44.100]  and freedom instead of focusing on the enemy.
[1:49:44.100 --> 1:49:46.100]  But you've still got to focus
[1:49:46.100 --> 1:49:48.100]  because just like we were talking to Brayden Morrison
[1:49:48.100 --> 1:49:50.100]  who's a student. He was talking about his little brother
[1:49:50.100 --> 1:49:52.100]  in middle school. He's a college student
[1:49:52.100 --> 1:49:54.100]  and how they've got this program
[1:49:54.100 --> 1:49:56.100]  that's in the news by the way. We pulled the articles up
[1:49:56.100 --> 1:49:58.100]  what he's talking about where
[1:49:58.100 --> 1:50:00.100]  prosecutors and lawyers
[1:50:00.100 --> 1:50:02.100]  and the public defendants
[1:50:02.100 --> 1:50:04.100]  and the DA's
[1:50:04.100 --> 1:50:06.100]  and the programs in the high schools
[1:50:06.100 --> 1:50:08.100]  the middle schools are run
[1:50:08.100 --> 1:50:10.100]  by these leftist groups
[1:50:10.100 --> 1:50:12.100]  it's just unbelievable. So Brayden Morrison
[1:50:12.100 --> 1:50:14.100]  who's just a caller but
[1:50:14.100 --> 1:50:16.100]  we're more and more going to have callers on as guests
[1:50:16.100 --> 1:50:18.100]  you've been making great points.
[1:50:18.100 --> 1:50:20.100]  You're Skype halts every 30 seconds or so
[1:50:20.100 --> 1:50:22.100]  so we're going to work on that before we have you back on.
[1:50:22.100 --> 1:50:24.100]  But just get back to your brother
[1:50:24.100 --> 1:50:26.100]  and get back to that program and tell folks the name of it
[1:50:26.100 --> 1:50:28.100]  again so they can look it up. I'm going to show TV viewers
[1:50:28.100 --> 1:50:30.100]  a few of the articles while you're talking.
[1:50:30.100 --> 1:50:32.100]  OK, so
[1:50:32.100 --> 1:50:34.100]  the program's name is
[1:50:34.100 --> 1:50:36.100]  Czechology. I don't know exactly how long
[1:50:36.100 --> 1:50:38.100]  it's been around
[1:50:38.100 --> 1:50:40.100]  but all I know is that when my brother
[1:50:40.100 --> 1:50:42.100]  told me that this is what he was doing in school
[1:50:42.100 --> 1:50:44.100]  I knew
[1:50:44.100 --> 1:50:46.100]  that I had to go and check it out for myself
[1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:48.100]  see what it was
[1:50:48.100 --> 1:50:50.100]  just because
[1:50:50.100 --> 1:50:52.100]  you know I've always been
[1:50:52.100 --> 1:50:54.100]  really into the sort of
[1:50:54.100 --> 1:50:56.100]  political landscape. I've always wanted to
[1:50:56.100 --> 1:50:58.100]  understand how all this stuff works
[1:50:58.100 --> 1:51:00.100]  but anyways
[1:51:00.100 --> 1:51:02.100]  a question that I asked yesterday
[1:51:02.100 --> 1:51:04.100]  when I called in
[1:51:04.100 --> 1:51:06.100]  was how are we able to
[1:51:08.100 --> 1:51:10.100]  get
[1:51:10.100 --> 1:51:12.100]  passive members of this community
[1:51:12.100 --> 1:51:14.100]  to become active members of this community
[1:51:14.100 --> 1:51:16.100]  and this is how we fight back
[1:51:16.100 --> 1:51:18.100]  against this sort of thing.
[1:51:18.100 --> 1:51:20.100]  I know there's been issues of
[1:51:20.100 --> 1:51:22.100]  various YouTube personalities
[1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:24.100]  social media figures
[1:51:24.100 --> 1:51:26.100]  being removed
[1:51:26.100 --> 1:51:28.100]  off these platforms
[1:51:28.100 --> 1:51:30.100]  but much like what
[1:51:30.100 --> 1:51:32.100]  our last guest that we just had on Jacob
[1:51:32.100 --> 1:51:34.100]  said when he was removed from PayPal
[1:51:34.100 --> 1:51:36.100]  if that was the only thing
[1:51:36.100 --> 1:51:38.100]  that he was on then
[1:51:38.100 --> 1:51:40.100]  he wouldn't be able to fight back. He would just be
[1:51:40.100 --> 1:51:42.100]  done.
[1:51:42.100 --> 1:51:44.100]  So redundancy is key in the situation.
[1:51:44.100 --> 1:51:46.100]  Absolutely, you got to have a lot of legs
[1:51:46.100 --> 1:51:48.100]  of the stool. Yeah.
[1:51:48.100 --> 1:51:50.100]  If you want to be able to take on these people
[1:51:50.100 --> 1:51:52.100]  then you need to make sure
[1:51:52.100 --> 1:51:54.100]  that you're not just putting all of your eggs
[1:51:54.100 --> 1:51:56.100]  in one basket.
[1:51:56.100 --> 1:51:58.100]  If people were just on YouTube
[1:51:58.100 --> 1:52:00.100]  or just on Facebook
[1:52:00.100 --> 1:52:02.100]  then they wouldn't stand a chance
[1:52:02.100 --> 1:52:04.100]  but
[1:52:04.100 --> 1:52:06.100]  I know that you had Nick Fuentes on
[1:52:06.100 --> 1:52:08.100]  and actually Owen Troyer had him on
[1:52:08.100 --> 1:52:10.100]  a couple of days ago too.
[1:52:10.100 --> 1:52:12.100]  His backup
[1:52:12.100 --> 1:52:14.100]  his redundancy is D-Live
[1:52:14.100 --> 1:52:16.100]  which is another alternative platform
[1:52:16.100 --> 1:52:18.100]  and so
[1:52:18.100 --> 1:52:20.100]  as a way of combating against this sort of
[1:52:20.100 --> 1:52:22.100]  situation in my school
[1:52:22.100 --> 1:52:24.100]  and in my community
[1:52:24.100 --> 1:52:26.100]  I was actually thinking about
[1:52:26.100 --> 1:52:28.100]  starting a YouTube channel
[1:52:28.100 --> 1:52:30.100]  but I also understood that
[1:52:30.100 --> 1:52:32.100]  if I wanted to do that
[1:52:32.100 --> 1:52:34.100]  then I would have to make sure that I had backups.
[1:52:34.100 --> 1:52:36.100]  Well that's it. Day one you go on
[1:52:36.100 --> 1:52:38.100]  and then you use their systems
[1:52:38.100 --> 1:52:40.100]  to build another separate platform
[1:52:40.100 --> 1:52:42.100]  that's exactly what we did.
[1:52:42.100 --> 1:52:44.100]  So let's expand on that.
[1:52:44.100 --> 1:52:46.100]  I haven't told this story yet
[1:52:46.100 --> 1:52:48.100]  because of a lot of reasons
[1:52:48.100 --> 1:52:50.100]  and because lawyers have advised
[1:52:50.100 --> 1:52:52.100]  me not to do it
[1:52:52.100 --> 1:52:54.100]  for whatever reason
[1:52:54.100 --> 1:52:56.100]  and you know I'm getting the point where
[1:52:56.100 --> 1:52:58.100]  things go well but I don't listen to lawyers
[1:52:58.100 --> 1:53:00.100]  things go bad
[1:53:00.100 --> 1:53:02.100]  when I do but we know
[1:53:02.100 --> 1:53:04.100]  who's funding all these lawsuits against InfoWars
[1:53:04.100 --> 1:53:06.100]  tens of millions of dollars
[1:53:06.100 --> 1:53:08.100]  you might have heard of him he's a Democratic presidential candidate
[1:53:08.100 --> 1:53:10.100]  and they're so dumb
[1:53:10.100 --> 1:53:12.100]  they don't know there's Fight Club
[1:53:12.100 --> 1:53:14.100]  where we get sent documents and know
[1:53:14.100 --> 1:53:16.100]  and somehow people want to just wait
[1:53:16.100 --> 1:53:18.100]  like that's some little magic marketing chip
[1:53:18.100 --> 1:53:20.100]  everybody needs to know
[1:53:20.100 --> 1:53:22.100]  that a certain person doesn't just think
[1:53:22.100 --> 1:53:24.100]  farmers suck and doesn't just
[1:53:24.100 --> 1:53:26.100]  tell his employees to abort their babies
[1:53:26.100 --> 1:53:28.100]  but funds trying to shut down
[1:53:28.100 --> 1:53:30.100]  talk show hosts
[1:53:30.100 --> 1:53:32.100]  and then also controls the curriculum
[1:53:32.100 --> 1:53:34.100]  in your schools we just showed the articles
[1:53:34.100 --> 1:53:36.100]  backing you up. Bloomberg paying salary
[1:53:36.100 --> 1:53:38.100]  of climate prosecutor
[1:53:38.100 --> 1:53:40.100]  working pro bono for Maryland's attorney general
[1:53:40.100 --> 1:53:42.100]  and then it goes through
[1:53:42.100 --> 1:53:44.100]  all these articles Michael Bloomberg
[1:53:44.100 --> 1:53:46.100]  is paying a climate prosecutor
[1:53:46.100 --> 1:53:48.100]  $125,000
[1:53:48.100 --> 1:53:50.100]  Michael Bloomberg is paying climate
[1:53:50.100 --> 1:53:52.100]  I saw an article this morning about how it's a big national story
[1:53:52.100 --> 1:53:54.100]  he funds a bunch of them so I got kind of
[1:53:54.100 --> 1:53:56.100]  the same article over and over again it's not just one
[1:53:56.100 --> 1:53:58.100]  he's funding
[1:53:58.100 --> 1:54:00.100]  sheriff's races and DA races
[1:54:00.100 --> 1:54:02.100]  everywhere
[1:54:02.100 --> 1:54:04.100]  Bloomberg accused of hijacking justice system
[1:54:04.100 --> 1:54:06.100]  with donor funded climate change
[1:54:06.100 --> 1:54:08.100]  prosecutors he's putting in
[1:54:08.100 --> 1:54:10.100]  that's Washington Times his own police everywhere
[1:54:10.100 --> 1:54:12.100]  so
[1:54:12.100 --> 1:54:14.100]  those are some older articles from May of last year
[1:54:14.100 --> 1:54:16.100]  there were new articles today so just click
[1:54:16.100 --> 1:54:18.100]  news guys or no big deal I'll do it
[1:54:18.100 --> 1:54:20.100]  it's okay
[1:54:20.100 --> 1:54:22.100]  I have this weird OCD thing now
[1:54:22.100 --> 1:54:24.100]  where I've got to have the latest thing and I thought
[1:54:24.100 --> 1:54:26.100]  I sent them a link this morning but it was
[1:54:26.100 --> 1:54:28.100]  Bloomberg under new scrutiny
[1:54:28.100 --> 1:54:30.100]  for funding network of prosecutors
[1:54:30.100 --> 1:54:32.100]  nationwide but I'll get it no big deal
[1:54:32.100 --> 1:54:34.100]  let me get
[1:54:34.100 --> 1:54:36.100]  let me get Adam Harry Cassidy's
[1:54:36.100 --> 1:54:38.100]  take on what we were just talking about
[1:54:38.100 --> 1:54:40.100]  they're nonsense
[1:54:40.100 --> 1:54:42.100]  monsters and
[1:54:42.100 --> 1:54:44.100]  any pre-packaged
[1:54:44.100 --> 1:54:46.100]  identity will do to put out there
[1:54:46.100 --> 1:54:48.100]  so these people
[1:54:48.100 --> 1:54:50.100]  the core of it is
[1:54:50.100 --> 1:54:52.100]  their psyche is built in mid-air
[1:54:52.100 --> 1:54:54.100]  most people define themselves
[1:54:54.100 --> 1:54:56.100]  by what they are as a soul
[1:54:56.100 --> 1:54:58.100]  and what they believe in
[1:54:58.100 --> 1:55:00.100]  these people define themselves by what they aren't
[1:55:00.100 --> 1:55:02.100]  and what they don't believe in however
[1:55:02.100 --> 1:55:04.100]  they don't even know what they're not
[1:55:04.100 --> 1:55:06.100]  so they're constantly
[1:55:06.100 --> 1:55:08.100]  depositing experiences
[1:55:08.100 --> 1:55:10.100]  into this void as if
[1:55:10.100 --> 1:55:12.100]  other aspects of their selves
[1:55:12.100 --> 1:55:14.100]  their physiology, their subconscious, their unconscious
[1:55:14.100 --> 1:55:16.100]  their this, their that
[1:55:16.100 --> 1:55:18.100]  are ultimately determining what they are
[1:55:18.100 --> 1:55:20.100]  so they're constantly depositing experience
[1:55:20.100 --> 1:55:22.100]  and identity into themselves
[1:55:22.100 --> 1:55:24.100]  waiting for effectively a chemical
[1:55:24.100 --> 1:55:26.100]  change in their personality
[1:55:26.100 --> 1:55:28.100]  and they're manifesting this
[1:55:28.100 --> 1:55:30.100]  experience of life
[1:55:30.100 --> 1:55:32.100]  which just sort of puts the
[1:55:32.100 --> 1:55:34.100]  psychosis on steroids
[1:55:34.100 --> 1:55:36.100]  did that make sense?
[1:55:36.100 --> 1:55:38.100]  no you're absolutely right everything about the left
[1:55:38.100 --> 1:55:40.100]  is, yeah there it is, Bloomberg
[1:55:40.100 --> 1:55:42.100]  does the Soros and buys up law enforcement
[1:55:42.100 --> 1:55:44.100]  yeah yeah that's one of them, print me that, that's new
[1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:46.100]  so it's
[1:55:46.100 --> 1:55:48.100]  true, you get around these people
[1:55:48.100 --> 1:55:50.100]  and they go, because I've been around
[1:55:50.100 --> 1:55:52.100]  Bloomberg but I've been around billionaires and globals
[1:55:52.100 --> 1:55:54.100]  who tried to hire me, I've listed some of the names
[1:55:54.100 --> 1:55:56.100]  and I've had witnesses and they go listen
[1:55:56.100 --> 1:55:58.100]  don't you want hundreds of millions
[1:55:58.100 --> 1:56:00.100]  of dollars to live in the best city and to be at the best
[1:56:00.100 --> 1:56:02.100]  restaurants with the elite
[1:56:02.100 --> 1:56:04.100]  and I go, but I don't agree with the policies
[1:56:04.100 --> 1:56:06.100]  they go, but it's money
[1:56:06.100 --> 1:56:08.100]  with us, it's literally
[1:56:08.100 --> 1:56:10.100]  they sit around and go
[1:56:10.100 --> 1:56:12.100]  I've got 50 billion, it doesn't even mean anything
[1:56:12.100 --> 1:56:14.100]  and they're like, they're robots
[1:56:14.100 --> 1:56:16.100]  it's like, they're the scum
[1:56:16.100 --> 1:56:18.100]  that would do this, but then they're always
[1:56:18.100 --> 1:56:20.100]  funding communism to sabotage us
[1:56:20.100 --> 1:56:22.100]  because they don't want competition
[1:56:22.100 --> 1:56:24.100]  it's a very, how do you juxtapose
[1:56:24.100 --> 1:56:26.100]  that Adam Cassidy
[1:56:26.100 --> 1:56:28.100]  without the elite
[1:56:28.100 --> 1:56:30.100]  funds communism, but they're the offshore
[1:56:30.100 --> 1:56:32.100]  billionaires
[1:56:32.100 --> 1:56:34.100]  okay I think back up and look at the big picture
[1:56:34.100 --> 1:56:36.100]  you're disseminating psychosis
[1:56:36.100 --> 1:56:38.100]  throughout the culture as a whole
[1:56:38.100 --> 1:56:40.100]  the only people who are going to be
[1:56:40.100 --> 1:56:42.100]  focused enough in that environment to actually
[1:56:42.100 --> 1:56:44.100]  do anything coherent
[1:56:44.100 --> 1:56:46.100]  are going to be the psychopaths
[1:56:46.100 --> 1:56:48.100]  now, political ponorology
[1:56:48.100 --> 1:56:50.100]  I believe the site's called ponorology.net
[1:56:50.100 --> 1:56:52.100]  where they talk about how 6% of the human population
[1:56:52.100 --> 1:56:54.100]  is their psychopaths
[1:56:54.100 --> 1:56:56.100]  and they inevitably rise to power
[1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:58.100]  so what this really is
[1:56:58.100 --> 1:57:00.100]  they're creating a docile dumb-down groove
[1:57:00.100 --> 1:57:02.100]  and they don't want real capitalism
[1:57:02.100 --> 1:57:04.100]  that creates individuals that might challenge them
[1:57:04.100 --> 1:57:06.100]  it's Satan
[1:57:06.100 --> 1:57:08.100]  overall, even from a
[1:57:08.100 --> 1:57:10.100]  secular point of view, you can't see it any other way
[1:57:10.100 --> 1:57:12.100]  it's a satanic spirit
[1:57:12.100 --> 1:57:14.100]  taking over the civilization
[1:57:14.100 --> 1:57:16.100]  the culture, making everybody crazy
[1:57:16.100 --> 1:57:18.100]  and the only people left who are going to be able to rule
[1:57:18.100 --> 1:57:20.100]  anything are the super psychopaths
[1:57:20.100 --> 1:57:22.100]  who want to kill everybody
[1:57:22.100 --> 1:57:24.100]  which is the knowledge of evil
[1:57:24.100 --> 1:57:26.100]  it's not like
[1:57:26.100 --> 1:57:28.100]  Adam, this idiot didn't know what evil was
[1:57:28.100 --> 1:57:30.100]  I'm going to come back to you
[1:57:30.100 --> 1:57:32.100]  and say there, knowledge of evil means it's evil systems
[1:57:32.100 --> 1:57:34.100]  you know how to build evil systems
[1:57:34.100 --> 1:57:36.100]  and that's what knowledge of evil is
[1:57:36.100 --> 1:57:38.100]  and anybody studies these guys
[1:57:38.100 --> 1:57:40.100]  you learn the knowledge of evil
[1:57:40.100 --> 1:57:42.100]  and you're like, what the hell are they doing
[1:57:42.100 --> 1:57:44.100]  but you figure out, man, they got a plan
[1:57:46.100 --> 1:57:48.100]  real stuff, man, we're talking about the real deal here
[1:57:48.100 --> 1:57:50.100]  and I love Trump all day long
[1:57:50.100 --> 1:57:52.100]  but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people
[1:57:52.100 --> 1:57:54.100]  keep running rough shot over everybody
[1:57:54.100 --> 1:57:56.100]  I mean, I've got a problem
[1:57:56.100 --> 1:57:58.100]  and we'll just take the Trump rallies over
[1:57:58.100 --> 1:58:00.100]  that said, about two months ago
[1:58:00.100 --> 1:58:02.100]  I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet
[1:58:02.100 --> 1:58:04.100]  we have a warehouse full of
[1:58:04.100 --> 1:58:06.100]  hundreds of thousands of stickers
[1:58:06.100 --> 1:58:08.100]  20 different stickers, impeach the Democrats
[1:58:08.100 --> 1:58:10.100]  save the Second Amendment
[1:58:10.100 --> 1:58:12.100]  defend the First Amendment in FullWars.com
[1:58:12.100 --> 1:58:14.100]  and it looks like duct tape
[1:58:14.100 --> 1:58:16.100]  but it's just a regular sticker, you put it over your mouth
[1:58:16.100 --> 1:58:18.100]  you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over
[1:58:18.100 --> 1:58:20.100]  without even disrupting things
[1:58:20.100 --> 1:58:22.100]  people say, why are you doing this, what's happening
[1:58:22.100 --> 1:58:24.100]  when you go, well, we're being censored
[1:58:24.100 --> 1:58:26.100]  Trump won't do anything about it
[1:58:26.100 --> 1:58:28.100]  let me just ask you what you think
[1:58:28.100 --> 1:58:30.100]  because I've not launched this yet
[1:58:30.100 --> 1:58:32.100]  it's brilliant, you've taken the very element
[1:58:32.100 --> 1:58:34.100]  that they try to repress you with
[1:58:34.100 --> 1:58:36.100]  that silence and made it into a weapon
[1:58:36.100 --> 1:58:38.100]  you have the loudest sound of all
[1:58:38.100 --> 1:58:40.100]  silence and you know what's most
[1:58:40.100 --> 1:58:42.100]  disturbing to people?
[1:58:42.100 --> 1:58:44.100]  silence
[1:58:46.100 --> 1:58:48.100]  I spend a lot of time
[1:58:48.100 --> 1:58:50.100]  reminding the InfoWars
[1:58:50.100 --> 1:58:52.100]  family of listeners and viewers
[1:58:52.100 --> 1:58:54.100]  that
[1:58:54.100 --> 1:58:56.100]  without you we won't be on the air
[1:58:56.100 --> 1:58:58.100]  and I spend a lot of time thanking you
[1:58:58.100 --> 1:59:00.100]  but I really think you should thank yourself
[1:59:00.100 --> 1:59:02.100]  for keeping us on the air and really
[1:59:02.100 --> 1:59:04.100]  changing the world for the better and raising the alarm
[1:59:04.100 --> 1:59:06.100]  as modern ball reveres
[1:59:06.100 --> 1:59:08.100]  but something I should spend more time on
[1:59:08.100 --> 1:59:10.100]  is just reminding you
[1:59:10.100 --> 1:59:12.100]  that these products are really amazing
[1:59:12.100 --> 1:59:14.100]  you've got that pledge from me
[1:59:14.100 --> 1:59:16.100]  but you've seen the third-party test out there
[1:59:16.100 --> 1:59:18.100]  the air filtration, the water filtration
[1:59:18.100 --> 1:59:20.100]  the supplements are all the very best
[1:59:20.100 --> 1:59:22.100]  you're going to find out there
[1:59:22.100 --> 1:59:24.100]  you can't fund an operation
[1:59:24.100 --> 1:59:26.100]  anywhere else that's fighting the globalist
[1:59:26.100 --> 1:59:28.100]  this hard
[1:59:28.100 --> 1:59:30.100]  so it's not a burden to support InfoWars
[1:59:30.100 --> 1:59:32.100]  it really is
[1:59:32.100 --> 1:59:34.100]  something that is
[1:59:34.100 --> 1:59:36.100]  good for everybody
[1:59:36.100 --> 1:59:38.100]  that stands for justice and freedom
[1:59:38.100 --> 1:59:40.100]  and makes your life and your family's life
[1:59:40.100 --> 1:59:42.100]  and your children's life so much better
[1:59:42.100 --> 1:59:44.100]  so visit InfoWarsStore.com
[1:59:44.100 --> 1:59:54.100]  today
[1:59:54.100 --> 1:59:56.100]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:59:56.100 --> 2:00:24.100]  music
[2:00:24.100 --> 2:00:26.100]  it's way more interesting than just some regular guests
[2:00:26.100 --> 2:00:28.100]  that we have a big guest
[2:00:28.100 --> 2:00:30.100]  the author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Treaty
[2:00:30.100 --> 2:00:32.100]  who's been really pioneering
[2:00:32.100 --> 2:00:34.100]  nobody else has been more pioneering
[2:00:34.100 --> 2:00:36.100]  on exposing what's really happening with the coronavirus
[2:00:36.100 --> 2:00:38.100]  other than Mike Adams
[2:00:38.100 --> 2:00:40.100]  Mike Adams was like just stunningly
[2:00:40.100 --> 2:00:42.100]  vanguard on this
[2:00:42.100 --> 2:00:44.100]  but his wife is Taiwanese-American
[2:00:44.100 --> 2:00:46.100]  and so he has all the contacts over there
[2:00:46.100 --> 2:00:48.100]  so he's reading the news
[2:00:48.100 --> 2:00:50.100]  over there and translating in here
[2:00:50.100 --> 2:00:52.100]  but Dr. Boyle's going to join us
[2:00:52.100 --> 2:00:54.100]  and we're going to talk a little bit about
[2:00:54.100 --> 2:00:56.100]  the capacity and also the college
[2:00:56.100 --> 2:00:58.100]  student Brayden Morris at Fetishup
[2:00:58.100 --> 2:01:00.100]  Brayden
[2:01:00.100 --> 2:01:02.100]  next minute or two closing comments
[2:01:02.100 --> 2:01:04.100]  are the points you'd like to make
[2:01:04.100 --> 2:01:06.100]  thanks for joining us
[2:01:06.100 --> 2:01:08.100]  okay so
[2:01:08.100 --> 2:01:10.100]  closing comments here
[2:01:10.100 --> 2:01:12.100]  I was talking about
[2:01:12.100 --> 2:01:14.100]  you know what could we do
[2:01:14.100 --> 2:01:16.100]  as you know conservatives
[2:01:16.100 --> 2:01:18.100]  to try to increase our own platforms
[2:01:18.100 --> 2:01:20.100]  even though
[2:01:20.100 --> 2:01:22.100]  so something that we can do
[2:01:22.100 --> 2:01:24.100]  that's being done because we're successful
[2:01:24.100 --> 2:01:26.100]  so you need to do more
[2:01:26.100 --> 2:01:28.100]  you're in a war and you're under attack
[2:01:28.100 --> 2:01:30.100]  it's because you're successful
[2:01:30.100 --> 2:01:32.100]  100% if you've seen
[2:01:32.100 --> 2:01:34.100]  what happened with the grippers
[2:01:34.100 --> 2:01:36.100]  going after turning point USA
[2:01:36.100 --> 2:01:38.100]  you would know that we absolutely have the power
[2:01:38.100 --> 2:01:40.100]  to not only go after
[2:01:40.100 --> 2:01:42.100]  just the left but conservative Inc
[2:01:42.100 --> 2:01:44.100]  which is also wishing to stun our growth as much as possible
[2:01:44.100 --> 2:01:46.100]  so something that listeners can do
[2:01:46.100 --> 2:01:48.100]  if you have you know Facebook accounts
[2:01:48.100 --> 2:01:50.100]  really any sort of social media
[2:01:50.100 --> 2:01:52.100]  you know that
[2:01:52.100 --> 2:01:54.100]  we're going to end up being censored
[2:01:54.100 --> 2:01:56.100]  but there's a couple of flaws in the system
[2:01:56.100 --> 2:01:58.100]  that people have been taking advantage of
[2:01:58.100 --> 2:02:00.100]  for a really long time
[2:02:00.100 --> 2:02:02.100]  there is in order to
[2:02:02.100 --> 2:02:04.100]  bypass text filters
[2:02:04.100 --> 2:02:06.100]  something that you can do is
[2:02:06.100 --> 2:02:08.100]  use letters and characters
[2:02:08.100 --> 2:02:10.100]  from other languages
[2:02:10.100 --> 2:02:12.100]  that look like the ones in English
[2:02:12.100 --> 2:02:14.100]  and you're able to get your point across that way because
[2:02:14.100 --> 2:02:16.100]  technically the computer
[2:02:16.100 --> 2:02:18.100]  thinks that it isn't saying the same thing
[2:02:18.100 --> 2:02:20.100]  exactly
[2:02:20.100 --> 2:02:22.100]  and another thing that we can do is
[2:02:22.100 --> 2:02:24.100]  we know that
[2:02:24.100 --> 2:02:26.100]  pretty much any link to info wars
[2:02:26.100 --> 2:02:28.100]  is going to be
[2:02:28.100 --> 2:02:30.100]  automatically removed
[2:02:30.100 --> 2:02:32.100]  so another way of getting around that would be
[2:02:32.100 --> 2:02:34.100]  to use something called a URL
[2:02:34.100 --> 2:02:36.100]  shortener
[2:02:36.100 --> 2:02:38.100]  or you know even another
[2:02:38.100 --> 2:02:40.100]  program like ad fly
[2:02:40.100 --> 2:02:42.100]  or something like that
[2:02:42.100 --> 2:02:44.100]  you're able to take the link
[2:02:44.100 --> 2:02:46.100]  into this program
[2:02:46.100 --> 2:02:48.100]  and it will spit out
[2:02:48.100 --> 2:02:50.100]  a totally different link
[2:02:50.100 --> 2:02:52.100]  it's true
[2:02:52.100 --> 2:02:54.100]  and we should have you back as a guest
[2:02:54.100 --> 2:02:56.100]  just a real world solution
[2:02:56.100 --> 2:02:58.100]  that's why we created like news wars
[2:02:58.100 --> 2:03:00.100]  now in banned out video those are censored now as well
[2:03:00.100 --> 2:03:02.100]  but exactly info wars is the big evil one
[2:03:02.100 --> 2:03:04.100]  that they want blocked but word of mouth
[2:03:04.100 --> 2:03:06.100]  it's the best to promote
[2:03:06.100 --> 2:03:08.100]  because people know that's verboten
[2:03:08.100 --> 2:03:10.100]  thank you so much Brayden Morrison
[2:03:10.100 --> 2:03:12.100]  and I really want to get you back on
[2:03:12.100 --> 2:03:14.100]  in the near future on this show
[2:03:14.100 --> 2:03:16.100]  and others we really appreciate you
[2:03:16.100 --> 2:03:18.100]  yeah thank you very much I appreciate it
[2:03:18.100 --> 2:03:20.100]  and anybody out there
[2:03:20.100 --> 2:03:22.100]  if you want to get in contact with me
[2:03:22.100 --> 2:03:24.100]  Instagram is
[2:03:24.100 --> 2:03:26.100]  it's underscore bradyo
[2:03:26.100 --> 2:03:28.100]  and snapchat is bradynm1401
[2:03:28.100 --> 2:03:30.100]  thank you very much for the opportunity sir
[2:03:30.100 --> 2:03:32.100]  we'll talk to you again soon
[2:03:32.100 --> 2:03:34.100]  alright we only got like a minute left
[2:03:34.100 --> 2:03:36.100]  thank you for coming on Adam Harry
[2:03:36.100 --> 2:03:38.100]  Cassidy towerofbabel.ca
[2:03:38.100 --> 2:03:40.100]  talk about the tower of Babel system real fast
[2:03:40.100 --> 2:03:42.100]  well the
[2:03:42.100 --> 2:03:44.100]  the software we need for this hardware
[2:03:44.100 --> 2:03:46.100]  is the spiritual identity that begins
[2:03:46.100 --> 2:03:48.100]  a conception and that you then express
[2:03:48.100 --> 2:03:50.100]  into physical reality
[2:03:50.100 --> 2:03:52.100]  what they want is for you to have no identity
[2:03:52.100 --> 2:03:54.100]  except for one that is expressed externally
[2:03:54.100 --> 2:03:56.100]  upon you often by yourself
[2:03:56.100 --> 2:03:58.100]  as you are select
[2:03:58.100 --> 2:04:00.100]  given no identity to have
[2:04:00.100 --> 2:04:02.100]  but you can choose
[2:04:02.100 --> 2:04:04.100]  from outside of yourself
[2:04:04.100 --> 2:04:06.100]  so that is the control system
[2:04:06.100 --> 2:04:08.100]  as I see it
[2:04:08.100 --> 2:04:10.100]  read more on my blog towerofbabel.ca
[2:04:10.100 --> 2:04:12.100]  I'd really like anybody to help me
[2:04:12.100 --> 2:04:14.100]  get my brother out of the psychiatric abuse
[2:04:14.100 --> 2:04:16.100]  he suffered his entire life
[2:04:16.100 --> 2:04:18.100]  he's an outpatient on Gilmore street
[2:04:18.100 --> 2:04:20.100]  at options buy town
[2:04:20.100 --> 2:04:22.100]  he's blinded himself now
[2:04:22.100 --> 2:04:24.100]  after being overmedicated and unattended
[2:04:24.100 --> 2:04:26.100]  in multiple self harm incidents
[2:04:26.100 --> 2:04:28.100]  months apart during their dismissal
[2:04:28.100 --> 2:04:30.100]  of my complaint
[2:04:30.100 --> 2:04:32.100]  we're out of time brother we love you we appreciate you
[2:04:32.100 --> 2:04:34.100]  and what you talk about
[2:04:34.100 --> 2:04:36.100]  they try to give us an identity that's false
[2:04:36.100 --> 2:04:38.100]  this is the key
[2:04:38.100 --> 2:04:40.100]  we have an identity God gives us at birth
[2:04:40.100 --> 2:04:42.100]  our destiny and we take it
[2:04:42.100 --> 2:04:44.100]  and I saw all these fake identities
[2:04:44.100 --> 2:04:46.100]  I knew my identity I knew my destiny
[2:04:46.100 --> 2:04:48.100]  from the time I was like two years old
[2:04:48.100 --> 2:04:50.100]  what you talked about is powerful
[2:04:50.100 --> 2:04:52.100]  we really appreciate you sir
[2:04:52.100 --> 2:05:08.100]  at the end of world war two
[2:05:08.100 --> 2:05:10.100]  decided to repackage themselves as trans
[2:05:10.100 --> 2:05:12.100]  humanist
[2:05:12.100 --> 2:05:14.100]  now in the year 2020
[2:05:14.100 --> 2:05:16.100]  to set the precedent
[2:05:16.100 --> 2:05:18.100]  that people can be turned into cyborgs
[2:05:18.100 --> 2:05:20.100]  that robots can be given
[2:05:20.100 --> 2:05:22.100]  rights you name it
[2:05:22.100 --> 2:05:24.100]  they are intimidating and arresting people
[2:05:24.100 --> 2:05:26.100]  all over the world
[2:05:26.100 --> 2:05:28.100]  who simply misgender someone
[2:05:28.100 --> 2:05:30.100]  so the ultimate crime
[2:05:30.100 --> 2:05:32.100]  will be even asking
[2:05:32.100 --> 2:05:34.100]  what someone is
[2:05:34.100 --> 2:05:36.100]  if you can't even tell what they are
[2:05:36.100 --> 2:05:38.100]  this is the ultimate
[2:05:38.100 --> 2:05:40.100]  Kafkaesque mind control
[2:05:40.100 --> 2:05:42.100]  and there's several big articles up on infowars.com
[2:05:42.100 --> 2:05:44.100]  that break this down
[2:05:44.100 --> 2:05:46.100]  UK teen fine under house arrest
[2:05:46.100 --> 2:05:48.100]  for asking trans police officers
[2:05:48.100 --> 2:05:50.100]  gender UK mother
[2:05:50.100 --> 2:05:52.100]  spare jail for misgendering trans woman
[2:05:52.100 --> 2:06:20.100]  today one thousand pound fine
[2:06:20.100 --> 2:06:22.100]  all right
[2:06:22.100 --> 2:06:24.100]  I have not touched
[2:06:24.100 --> 2:06:26.100]  the coronavirus today
[2:06:26.100 --> 2:06:28.100]  because I was waiting
[2:06:28.100 --> 2:06:30.100]  for professor Dr. Francis A. Boyle
[2:06:30.100 --> 2:06:32.100]  to come on
[2:06:32.100 --> 2:06:34.100]  leading American expert
[2:06:34.100 --> 2:06:36.100]  international law
[2:06:36.100 --> 2:06:38.100]  responsible for drafting the biological weapons
[2:06:38.100 --> 2:06:40.100]  anti-terrorism act of 89
[2:06:40.100 --> 2:06:42.100]  was adopted into world law
[2:06:42.100 --> 2:06:44.100]  the American implementing legislation
[2:06:44.100 --> 2:06:46.100]  for the biological weapons convention
[2:06:46.100 --> 2:06:48.100]  he served the board of directors
[2:06:48.100 --> 2:06:50.100]  of amnesty international
[2:06:50.100 --> 2:06:52.100]  represented by the university convenience
[2:06:52.100 --> 2:06:54.100]  he served as a legal advisor
[2:06:54.100 --> 2:06:56.100]  to palestinian delegation
[2:06:56.100 --> 2:06:58.100]  the middle east peace negotiations
[2:06:58.100 --> 2:07:00.100]  the Bertrand Russell peace lectures
[2:07:00.100 --> 2:07:02.100]  professor Boyle teaches international law
[2:07:02.100 --> 2:07:04.100]  at the University of Illinois
[2:07:04.100 --> 2:07:06.100]  and his author of
[2:07:06.100 --> 2:07:08.100]  and he goes through all the different books he's written
[2:07:08.100 --> 2:07:10.100]  he holds a doctor of law
[2:07:10.100 --> 2:07:12.100]  magna cum laude as well as a phd
[2:07:12.100 --> 2:07:14.100]  and political science from Harvard University
[2:07:14.100 --> 2:07:16.100]  his latest book is poems against the empire
[2:07:16.100 --> 2:07:18.100]  which is a collection of poetic reflections
[2:07:18.100 --> 2:07:20.100]  on his experiences
[2:07:20.100 --> 2:07:22.100]  fighting for peace justice human rights
[2:07:22.100 --> 2:07:24.100]  international law social welfare
[2:07:24.100 --> 2:07:26.100]  in the united states constitution
[2:07:26.100 --> 2:07:28.100]  and he joins us now
[2:07:28.100 --> 2:07:30.100]  I would call him a classical liberal
[2:07:30.100 --> 2:07:32.100]  liberal today or lepers is a fascist
[2:07:32.100 --> 2:07:34.100]  just like a neocon is a fascist
[2:07:34.100 --> 2:07:36.100]  and so the terms don't mean anything
[2:07:36.100 --> 2:07:38.100]  and he's got big breaking exclusive
[2:07:38.100 --> 2:07:40.100]  news here
[2:07:40.100 --> 2:07:42.100]  and he sent me notes but I think the best way
[2:07:42.100 --> 2:07:44.100]  to do this is for at least the next
[2:07:44.100 --> 2:07:46.100]  three segments he pretty much
[2:07:46.100 --> 2:07:48.100]  host so that he can walk you through this
[2:07:48.100 --> 2:07:50.100]  but
[2:07:50.100 --> 2:07:52.100]  this is serious
[2:07:52.100 --> 2:07:54.100]  news this is very important news everybody
[2:07:54.100 --> 2:07:56.100]  should pay attention to
[2:07:56.100 --> 2:07:58.100]  the wool on coronavirus came out of the
[2:07:58.100 --> 2:08:00.100]  Bioware for a lab that's even being said by the white
[2:08:00.100 --> 2:08:02.100]  house now Dr. Boyle
[2:08:02.100 --> 2:08:04.100]  others were saying in three weeks ago
[2:08:04.100 --> 2:08:06.100]  the UNC lab should be shut down
[2:08:06.100 --> 2:08:08.100]  everyone investigated for violating biological weapons
[2:08:08.100 --> 2:08:10.100]  anti-terrorism act
[2:08:10.100 --> 2:08:12.100]  I'm just going to he's got major studies
[2:08:12.100 --> 2:08:14.100]  just come out so he
[2:08:14.100 --> 2:08:16.100]  he's an expert on bioweapons and the law
[2:08:16.100 --> 2:08:18.100]  so we've got eight minutes to break here
[2:08:18.100 --> 2:08:20.100]  then a nine minute segment a ten minute segment
[2:08:20.100 --> 2:08:22.100]  I'll take us into break Dr. Boyle
[2:08:22.100 --> 2:08:24.100]  but you go ahead and host you've got the floor
[2:08:24.100 --> 2:08:26.100]  here thanks for joining us
[2:08:26.100 --> 2:08:28.100]  well Alex thank you very much
[2:08:28.100 --> 2:08:30.100]  for having me on my best to your
[2:08:30.100 --> 2:08:32.100]  viewing audience yes I
[2:08:32.100 --> 2:08:34.100]  sent your
[2:08:34.100 --> 2:08:36.100]  assistant a
[2:08:36.100 --> 2:08:38.100]  email on Monday that
[2:08:38.100 --> 2:08:40.100]  I had revised my
[2:08:40.100 --> 2:08:42.100]  opinion on certain matters and also
[2:08:42.100 --> 2:08:44.100]  I had come up
[2:08:44.100 --> 2:08:46.100]  with what I concluded were
[2:08:46.100 --> 2:08:48.100]  the smoking guns that
[2:08:48.100 --> 2:08:50.100]  the Wuhan
[2:08:50.100 --> 2:08:52.100]  coronavirus came out of
[2:08:52.100 --> 2:08:54.100]  that BSL
[2:08:54.100 --> 2:08:56.100]  for facility and you'll note
[2:08:56.100 --> 2:08:58.100]  now that
[2:08:58.100 --> 2:09:00.100]  Senator Cotton saying the same thing
[2:09:00.100 --> 2:09:02.100]  he was behind me at
[2:09:02.100 --> 2:09:04.100]  Harvard Law School and
[2:09:04.100 --> 2:09:06.100]  despite that the New York
[2:09:06.100 --> 2:09:08.100]  Times swind him
[2:09:08.100 --> 2:09:10.100]  and as you know
[2:09:10.100 --> 2:09:12.100]  Senator Cotton is
[2:09:12.100 --> 2:09:14.100]  a decorated combat
[2:09:14.100 --> 2:09:16.100]  veteran no surprise there
[2:09:16.100 --> 2:09:18.100]  from the New York Times so
[2:09:18.100 --> 2:09:20.100]  yes I have these scientific studies
[2:09:20.100 --> 2:09:22.100]  now basically I read these things
[2:09:22.100 --> 2:09:24.100]  over the weekend which is why
[2:09:24.100 --> 2:09:26.100]  I
[2:09:26.100 --> 2:09:28.100]  changed my mind and said I had
[2:09:28.100 --> 2:09:30.100]  new information
[2:09:30.100 --> 2:09:32.100]  and alerted your assistant
[2:09:32.100 --> 2:09:34.100]  on Monday and
[2:09:34.100 --> 2:09:36.100]  today is the first day I could give you
[2:09:36.100 --> 2:09:38.100]  an extensive interview I want
[2:09:38.100 --> 2:09:40.100]  to go through these
[2:09:40.100 --> 2:09:42.100]  scientific studies so that
[2:09:42.100 --> 2:09:44.100]  you and the viewing audience
[2:09:44.100 --> 2:09:46.100]  understand their implications
[2:09:46.100 --> 2:09:48.100]  I believe they are the
[2:09:48.100 --> 2:09:50.100]  smoking gun of what happened here
[2:09:52.100 --> 2:09:54.100]  the first is by
[2:09:56.100 --> 2:09:58.100]  some life scientists
[2:10:00.100 --> 2:10:02.100]  three from Marseille, France
[2:10:02.100 --> 2:10:04.100]  and one from Montreal
[2:10:04.100 --> 2:10:06.100]  clinical research laboratories
[2:10:06.100 --> 2:10:08.100]  there it was
[2:10:08.100 --> 2:10:10.100]  published
[2:10:10.100 --> 2:10:12.100]  on antiviral
[2:10:12.100 --> 2:10:14.100]  research 10
[2:10:14.100 --> 2:10:16.100]  February 2020
[2:10:16.100 --> 2:10:18.100]  and I had a chance
[2:10:18.100 --> 2:10:20.100]  to read it over the weekend
[2:10:20.100 --> 2:10:22.100]  I read these types of things over the weekend
[2:10:22.100 --> 2:10:24.100]  now
[2:10:24.100 --> 2:10:26.100]  I'm not going to go through this whole study
[2:10:28.100 --> 2:10:30.100]  but they did a genetic analysis
[2:10:30.100 --> 2:10:32.100]  of the
[2:10:32.100 --> 2:10:34.100]  Wuhan coronavirus
[2:10:34.100 --> 2:10:36.100]  and
[2:10:36.100 --> 2:10:38.100]  let me just conclude
[2:10:40.100 --> 2:10:42.100]  the critical part here
[2:10:42.100 --> 2:10:44.100]  where it says
[2:10:44.100 --> 2:10:46.100]  quote and may
[2:10:46.100 --> 2:10:48.100]  provide a gain
[2:10:48.100 --> 2:10:50.100]  of function
[2:10:50.100 --> 2:10:52.100]  to the
[2:10:52.100 --> 2:10:54.100]  2019 NCOV
[2:10:54.100 --> 2:10:56.100]  for efficient
[2:10:56.100 --> 2:10:58.100]  spreading in the human population
[2:10:58.100 --> 2:11:00.100]  compared
[2:11:00.100 --> 2:11:02.100]  to other beta coronaviruses
[2:11:02.100 --> 2:11:04.100]  let me repeat that
[2:11:04.100 --> 2:11:06.100]  quote may provide
[2:11:06.100 --> 2:11:08.100]  a gain of function
[2:11:08.100 --> 2:11:10.100]  to the 2019 NCOV
[2:11:10.100 --> 2:11:12.100]  now for
[2:11:12.100 --> 2:11:14.100]  efficient spreading
[2:11:14.100 --> 2:11:16.100]  in the human population
[2:11:16.100 --> 2:11:18.100]  compared to other coronaviruses
[2:11:18.100 --> 2:11:20.100]  so Alex
[2:11:20.100 --> 2:11:22.100]  you recall
[2:11:22.100 --> 2:11:24.100]  in the first interview I gave
[2:11:24.100 --> 2:11:26.100]  to your colleague
[2:11:26.100 --> 2:11:28.100]  Mr. Schreuer
[2:11:28.100 --> 2:11:30.100]  again the follow-up interviews I
[2:11:30.100 --> 2:11:32.100]  gave to you I stated
[2:11:32.100 --> 2:11:34.100]  that this was clearly
[2:11:34.100 --> 2:11:36.100]  a gain of function
[2:11:36.100 --> 2:11:38.100]  offensive
[2:11:38.100 --> 2:11:40.100]  biological warfare
[2:11:40.100 --> 2:11:42.100]  you said that three weeks ago
[2:11:42.100 --> 2:11:44.100]  you said that two weeks ago and now
[2:11:44.100 --> 2:11:46.100]  it's not just a big Indian institute
[2:11:46.100 --> 2:11:48.100]  now more life scientists have scanned it
[2:11:48.100 --> 2:11:50.100]  they're saying exactly what you were saying
[2:11:50.100 --> 2:11:52.100]  right well this article
[2:11:52.100 --> 2:11:54.100]  here is the smoking gun
[2:11:54.100 --> 2:11:56.100]  okay it clearly
[2:11:56.100 --> 2:11:58.100]  tell people again the article and how they find it
[2:11:58.100 --> 2:12:00.100]  well you can
[2:12:00.100 --> 2:12:02.100]  I got it on
[2:12:02.100 --> 2:12:04.100]  science direct
[2:12:04.100 --> 2:12:06.100]  antiviral research
[2:12:06.100 --> 2:12:08.100]  10 February 2020
[2:12:08.100 --> 2:12:10.100]  antiviral research
[2:12:10.100 --> 2:12:12.100]  10 February 2020
[2:12:14.100 --> 2:12:16.100]  and it's a long title but it starts out
[2:12:16.100 --> 2:12:18.100]  despite glycoprotein
[2:12:18.100 --> 2:12:20.100]  of the new coronavirus
[2:12:20.100 --> 2:12:22.100]  contains a foreign like cleavage site
[2:12:22.100 --> 2:12:24.100]  absent
[2:12:24.100 --> 2:12:26.100]  in the COV of the same
[2:12:26.100 --> 2:12:28.100]  so that's exactly what the prestigious intent
[2:12:28.100 --> 2:12:30.100]  this prestigious intent
[2:12:30.100 --> 2:12:32.100]  excuse me the prestigious Indian institute
[2:12:32.100 --> 2:12:34.100]  said is that it has
[2:12:34.100 --> 2:12:36.100]  the points where the artificial
[2:12:36.100 --> 2:12:38.100]  RNA was injected I mean they can
[2:12:38.100 --> 2:12:40.100]  see right where it happened
[2:12:40.100 --> 2:12:42.100]  right but this was
[2:12:42.100 --> 2:12:44.100]  a genetic that as you know
[2:12:44.100 --> 2:12:46.100]  that was withdrawn under political pressure
[2:12:46.100 --> 2:12:48.100]  but now we have
[2:12:48.100 --> 2:12:50.100]  four very distinguished life
[2:12:50.100 --> 2:12:52.100]  scientists here
[2:12:52.100 --> 2:12:54.100]  that's it right there
[2:12:54.100 --> 2:12:56.100]  and the
[2:12:56.100 --> 2:12:58.100]  smoking gun here is on
[2:12:58.100 --> 2:13:00.100]  page 11 near the
[2:13:00.100 --> 2:13:02.100]  bottom the last full
[2:13:02.100 --> 2:13:04.100]  paragraph from the bottom where it says
[2:13:04.100 --> 2:13:06.100]  may provide a gain of function
[2:13:06.100 --> 2:13:08.100]  to the coronavirus for efficient
[2:13:08.100 --> 2:13:10.100]  spreading in the human population
[2:13:10.100 --> 2:13:12.100]  so explain what that gain of function
[2:13:12.100 --> 2:13:14.100]  means because not all of us are experts on this
[2:13:14.100 --> 2:13:16.100]  like you doctor
[2:13:16.100 --> 2:13:18.100]  right well gain of fun now
[2:13:18.100 --> 2:13:20.100]  so let me repeat
[2:13:20.100 --> 2:13:22.100]  uh
[2:13:22.100 --> 2:13:24.100]  Alex as I've told you before
[2:13:24.100 --> 2:13:26.100]  gain of function technology
[2:13:26.100 --> 2:13:28.100]  is DNA genetic engineering
[2:13:28.100 --> 2:13:30.100]  of
[2:13:30.100 --> 2:13:32.100]  dangerous biological
[2:13:32.100 --> 2:13:34.100]  warfare
[2:13:34.100 --> 2:13:36.100]  substances to begin with
[2:13:36.100 --> 2:13:38.100]  of already bad pathogens
[2:13:38.100 --> 2:13:40.100]  right it's a turbo
[2:13:40.100 --> 2:13:42.100]  charging and
[2:13:42.100 --> 2:13:44.100]  gain of function work can only
[2:13:44.100 --> 2:13:46.100]  be done safely
[2:13:46.100 --> 2:13:48.100]  in a BSL4
[2:13:48.100 --> 2:13:50.100]  or a BSL3
[2:13:50.100 --> 2:13:52.100]  facility
[2:13:52.100 --> 2:13:54.100]  so I think clearly
[2:13:54.100 --> 2:13:56.100]  this is the smoking gun
[2:13:56.100 --> 2:13:58.100]  that the Wuhan
[2:13:58.100 --> 2:14:00.100]  coronavirus came out of
[2:14:00.100 --> 2:14:02.100]  that BSL4
[2:14:02.100 --> 2:14:04.100]  facility so does this mirror
[2:14:04.100 --> 2:14:06.100]  what the Indian Institute said or is this different
[2:14:06.100 --> 2:14:08.100]  why I think
[2:14:08.100 --> 2:14:10.100]  it goes beyond what the Indian
[2:14:10.100 --> 2:14:12.100]  study said but we'll get
[2:14:12.100 --> 2:14:14.100]  to that in a minute the Indian study
[2:14:14.100 --> 2:14:16.100]  okay so
[2:14:16.100 --> 2:14:18.100]  I think you know I've now
[2:14:18.100 --> 2:14:20.100]  excuse me
[2:14:22.100 --> 2:14:24.100]  provided the
[2:14:24.100 --> 2:14:26.100]  smoking gun here this is
[2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:28.100]  clearly
[2:14:28.100 --> 2:14:30.100]  a weaponized biological
[2:14:30.100 --> 2:14:32.100]  warfare agent and
[2:14:32.100 --> 2:14:34.100]  there is no legitimate
[2:14:34.100 --> 2:14:36.100]  scientific
[2:14:36.100 --> 2:14:38.100]  or medical use
[2:14:38.100 --> 2:14:40.100]  for gain of
[2:14:40.100 --> 2:14:42.100]  function technology
[2:14:42.100 --> 2:14:44.100]  DNA technology on bio warfare
[2:14:44.100 --> 2:14:46.100]  so there's no excuse that it's a vaccine
[2:14:46.100 --> 2:14:48.100]  test that got out
[2:14:48.100 --> 2:14:50.100]  that's blowing this is clearly
[2:14:50.100 --> 2:14:52.100]  an offensive biological
[2:14:52.100 --> 2:14:54.100]  warfare
[2:14:54.100 --> 2:14:56.100]  agent and it has no
[2:14:56.100 --> 2:14:58.100]  legitimate
[2:14:58.100 --> 2:15:00.100]  medical
[2:15:00.100 --> 2:15:02.100]  or other other
[2:15:02.100 --> 2:15:04.100]  this is beyond sensational
[2:15:04.100 --> 2:15:06.100]  is that why we're seeing the very
[2:15:06.100 --> 2:15:08.100]  serious response to it
[2:15:10.100 --> 2:15:12.100]  well you know Alex
[2:15:12.100 --> 2:15:14.100]  we first discussed this over
[2:15:14.100 --> 2:15:16.100]  three weeks ago
[2:15:16.100 --> 2:15:18.100]  and they're still
[2:15:18.100 --> 2:15:20.100]  attacking me for being a conspiracy
[2:15:20.100 --> 2:15:22.100]  serious and fake
[2:15:22.100 --> 2:15:24.100]  news and
[2:15:24.100 --> 2:15:26.100]  I'm a nutcase and a nut job
[2:15:26.100 --> 2:15:28.100]  and everything else so there's been
[2:15:28.100 --> 2:15:30.100]  a massive fight back
[2:15:30.100 --> 2:15:32.100]  in the all the mainstream
[2:15:32.100 --> 2:15:34.100]  news media against this
[2:15:34.100 --> 2:15:36.100]  and indeed as I told you
[2:15:36.100 --> 2:15:38.100]  before I've been completely
[2:15:38.100 --> 2:15:40.100]  censored out of all the
[2:15:40.100 --> 2:15:42.100]  mainstream news media here
[2:15:42.100 --> 2:15:44.100]  the United States but everything you said has
[2:15:44.100 --> 2:15:46.100]  been confirmed and now a major scientific
[2:15:46.100 --> 2:15:48.100]  groups come out and it confirmed it
[2:15:48.100 --> 2:15:50.100]  let's get back to that smoking gun and recap
[2:15:50.100 --> 2:15:52.100]  that and get all the other documentation
[2:15:52.100 --> 2:16:20.100]  right ahead

[2:19:02.100 --> 2:19:04.100]  the way forward things that
[2:19:04.100 --> 2:19:06.100]  I've discovered that I absolutely
[2:19:06.100 --> 2:19:08.100]  know work that if you
[2:19:08.100 --> 2:19:10.100]  listen to me and try them out for yourself

[2:19:20.100 --> 2:19:22.100]  my friends I harp
[2:19:22.100 --> 2:19:24.100]  and harp and harp about iodine
[2:19:24.100 --> 2:19:26.100]  because it's the good halogen
[2:19:26.100 --> 2:19:28.100]  fluoride's the bad halogen and people told
[2:19:28.100 --> 2:19:30.100]  me about it for years and I didn't listen
[2:19:30.100 --> 2:19:32.100]  and I'm so thankful that finally
[2:19:32.100 --> 2:19:34.100]  I listened to Dr. Grip like
[2:19:34.100 --> 2:19:36.100]  eight years ago I started taking
[2:19:36.100 --> 2:19:38.100]  true iodine
[2:19:38.100 --> 2:19:40.100]  atomic iodine we've got it

[2:19:52.100 --> 2:20:18.100]  lose unless you don't take action
[2:20:18.100 --> 2:20:20.100]  well we have a leading
[2:20:20.100 --> 2:20:22.100]  expert in international
[2:20:22.100 --> 2:20:24.100]  law who's led major delegations
[2:20:24.100 --> 2:20:26.100]  US government
[2:20:26.100 --> 2:20:28.100]  expert in biological
[2:20:28.100 --> 2:20:30.100]  weapons anti-terrorism
[2:20:30.100 --> 2:20:32.100]  responsible for drafting the biological weapons
[2:20:32.100 --> 2:20:34.100]  they terrorism act that got adopted as
[2:20:34.100 --> 2:20:36.100]  world law
[2:20:36.100 --> 2:20:38.100]  Dr. Francis Boyle here and I'm
[2:20:38.100 --> 2:20:40.100]  reading the same studies he's reading
[2:20:40.100 --> 2:20:42.100]  so more scientists come out
[2:20:42.100 --> 2:20:44.100]  and look at it and say this thing is
[2:20:44.100 --> 2:20:46.100]  man-made and they show how
[2:20:46.100 --> 2:20:48.100]  and they say it's conclusive
[2:20:48.100 --> 2:20:50.100]  you notice major Indian institutes came out
[2:20:50.100 --> 2:20:52.100]  and said the same thing three weeks ago
[2:20:52.100 --> 2:20:54.100]  and so
[2:20:54.100 --> 2:20:56.100]  we're going to walk through more of these studies
[2:20:56.100 --> 2:20:58.100]  in this segment next segment is a father
[2:20:58.100 --> 2:21:00.100]  as a citizen as a human
[2:21:00.100 --> 2:21:02.100]  as a citizen of the planet earth I'm going to ask Dr. Boyle
[2:21:02.100 --> 2:21:04.100]  what he really thinks
[2:21:04.100 --> 2:21:06.100]  the end game is here was this
[2:21:06.100 --> 2:21:08.100]  accidentally released
[2:21:08.100 --> 2:21:10.100]  as we were hoping and that's bad enough
[2:21:10.100 --> 2:21:12.100]  or is it something even more sinister
[2:21:12.100 --> 2:21:14.100]  are they using this as the excuse
[2:21:14.100 --> 2:21:16.100]  to invade Taiwan as they're now doing
[2:21:16.100 --> 2:21:18.100]  Dr. Boyle please continue
[2:21:18.100 --> 2:21:20.100]  with the studies the spike
[2:21:20.100 --> 2:21:22.100]  of and we have the whole
[2:21:22.100 --> 2:21:24.100]  breakdown here with the study
[2:21:24.100 --> 2:21:26.100]  right well now let me get
[2:21:26.100 --> 2:21:28.100]  to the second study
[2:21:28.100 --> 2:21:30.100]  which is another smoking gun
[2:21:30.100 --> 2:21:32.100]  and a bombshell Alex there's
[2:21:32.100 --> 2:21:34.100]  no other word for it you remember
[2:21:34.100 --> 2:21:36.100]  in our previous interview
[2:21:36.100 --> 2:21:38.100]  you asked me if this
[2:21:38.100 --> 2:21:40.100]  had come out of the DSL
[2:21:40.100 --> 2:21:42.100]  for facility in Winnipeg
[2:21:42.100 --> 2:21:44.100]  Canada was stolen out of there
[2:21:44.100 --> 2:21:46.100]  I said that that could have happened
[2:21:46.100 --> 2:21:48.100]  Winnipeg is
[2:21:48.100 --> 2:21:50.100]  our equivalent of Fort Detrick
[2:21:50.100 --> 2:21:52.100]  they do every type of hideous
[2:21:52.100 --> 2:21:54.100]  offensive Nazi type biological warfare
[2:21:54.100 --> 2:21:56.100]  work up there
[2:21:56.100 --> 2:21:58.100]  you can possibly imagine
[2:21:58.100 --> 2:22:00.100]  but again on the basis of
[2:22:00.100 --> 2:22:02.100]  materials scientific materials
[2:22:02.100 --> 2:22:04.100]  I had a chance to read
[2:22:04.100 --> 2:22:06.100]  over the weekend
[2:22:06.100 --> 2:22:08.100]  I have changed my opinion on that
[2:22:08.100 --> 2:22:10.100]  I think I have the definitive
[2:22:10.100 --> 2:22:12.100]  evidence where this came from
[2:22:12.100 --> 2:22:14.100]  and it came from
[2:22:14.100 --> 2:22:16.100]  the BSL3
[2:22:16.100 --> 2:22:18.100]  bio warfare lab
[2:22:18.100 --> 2:22:20.100]  at the University of North Carolina
[2:22:20.100 --> 2:22:22.100]  now I have condemned them
[2:22:22.100 --> 2:22:24.100]  before
[2:22:24.100 --> 2:22:26.100]  because they have done
[2:22:26.100 --> 2:22:28.100]  gain of function
[2:22:28.100 --> 2:22:30.100]  work DNA genetic
[2:22:30.100 --> 2:22:32.100]  engineering
[2:22:32.100 --> 2:22:34.100]  on every hideous biological warfare
[2:22:34.100 --> 2:22:36.100]  agent you can imagine
[2:22:36.100 --> 2:22:38.100]  including
[2:22:38.100 --> 2:22:40.100]  Merz at that time
[2:22:40.100 --> 2:22:42.100]  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
[2:22:42.100 --> 2:22:44.100]  agent
[2:22:44.100 --> 2:22:46.100]  which again is a
[2:22:46.100 --> 2:22:48.100]  bio warfare
[2:22:48.100 --> 2:22:50.100]  coronavirus
[2:22:50.100 --> 2:22:52.100]  now it just came to my
[2:22:52.100 --> 2:22:54.100]  say that again because we are going to pull this up as you speak
[2:22:54.100 --> 2:22:56.100]  you said the other study
[2:22:56.100 --> 2:22:58.100]  we pulled it up
[2:22:58.100 --> 2:23:00.100]  was there
[2:23:00.100 --> 2:23:02.100]  gain of function DNA
[2:23:02.100 --> 2:23:04.100]  genetic engineering on Merz
[2:23:04.100 --> 2:23:06.100]  which is Middle East Respiratory
[2:23:06.100 --> 2:23:08.100]  and that was the University of
[2:23:08.100 --> 2:23:10.100]  North Carolina
[2:23:10.100 --> 2:23:12.100]  right they have a BSL3
[2:23:12.100 --> 2:23:14.100]  bio warfare lab there
[2:23:14.100 --> 2:23:16.100]  that is something I keep reading that
[2:23:16.100 --> 2:23:18.100]  they do level 4 stuff at level 3s right
[2:23:20.100 --> 2:23:22.100]  I think they are but they are doing it
[2:23:22.100 --> 2:23:24.100]  with the level 3 the last I
[2:23:24.100 --> 2:23:26.100]  saw that is all they had
[2:23:26.100 --> 2:23:28.100]  but let me go through this
[2:23:28.100 --> 2:23:30.100]  study
[2:23:30.100 --> 2:23:32.100]  it is entitled
[2:23:32.100 --> 2:23:34.100]  a SARS like cluster
[2:23:34.100 --> 2:23:36.100]  of circulating back
[2:23:36.100 --> 2:23:38.100]  coronaviruses
[2:23:38.100 --> 2:23:40.100]  shows potential
[2:23:40.100 --> 2:23:42.100]  for human emergence
[2:23:42.100 --> 2:23:44.100]  so say it again because we have
[2:23:44.100 --> 2:23:46.100]  radio listeners hundreds of stations
[2:23:46.100 --> 2:23:48.100]  a SARS like cluster the name of the paper
[2:23:48.100 --> 2:23:50.100]  a SARS like cluster
[2:23:50.100 --> 2:23:52.100]  a SARS like cluster of
[2:23:52.100 --> 2:23:54.100]  circulating back
[2:23:54.100 --> 2:23:56.100]  coronaviruses shows potential
[2:23:56.100 --> 2:23:58.100]  for human emergence
[2:23:58.100 --> 2:24:00.100]  that is
[2:24:00.100 --> 2:24:02.100]  2015 December 21st
[2:24:02.100 --> 2:24:04.100]  we have it on screen
[2:24:04.100 --> 2:24:06.100]  that's it
[2:24:06.100 --> 2:24:08.100]  now if you look through this carefully
[2:24:08.100 --> 2:24:10.100]  first
[2:24:10.100 --> 2:24:12.100]  notice
[2:24:12.100 --> 2:24:14.100]  who was involved
[2:24:14.100 --> 2:24:16.100]  in this DNA genetic engineering
[2:24:16.100 --> 2:24:18.100]  of SARS
[2:24:18.100 --> 2:24:20.100]  which is already a biological warfare
[2:24:20.100 --> 2:24:22.100]  agent to give it
[2:24:22.100 --> 2:24:24.100]  gain of function activities
[2:24:24.100 --> 2:24:26.100]  and it has all these people there
[2:24:26.100 --> 2:24:28.100]  from
[2:24:28.100 --> 2:24:30.100]  the University of North Carolina
[2:24:30.100 --> 2:24:32.100]  at Chapel Hill
[2:24:32.100 --> 2:24:34.100]  from the Food and Drug Administration
[2:24:34.100 --> 2:24:36.100]  so you can't trust the Food and Drug Administration
[2:24:36.100 --> 2:24:38.100]  and then
[2:24:38.100 --> 2:24:40.100]  at the very bottom of the list
[2:24:40.100 --> 2:24:42.100]  who is
[2:24:42.100 --> 2:24:44.100]  involved
[2:24:44.100 --> 2:24:46.100]  Zheng Li
[2:24:46.100 --> 2:24:48.100]  Li Shi
[2:24:48.100 --> 2:24:50.100]  key laboratory of
[2:24:50.100 --> 2:24:52.100]  special pathogens and biosafety
[2:24:52.100 --> 2:24:54.100]  Wuhan
[2:24:54.100 --> 2:24:56.100]  Institute of Dereology
[2:24:56.100 --> 2:24:58.100]  Chinese Academy
[2:24:58.100 --> 2:25:00.100]  of Sciences
[2:25:00.100 --> 2:25:02.100]  Wuhan China
[2:25:02.100 --> 2:25:04.100]  so it's very clear to me
[2:25:04.100 --> 2:25:06.100]  that this
[2:25:06.100 --> 2:25:08.100]  scientists
[2:25:08.100 --> 2:25:10.100]  from the Wuhan Institute of Dereology
[2:25:10.100 --> 2:25:12.100]  got
[2:25:12.100 --> 2:25:14.100]  this
[2:25:14.100 --> 2:25:16.100]  gain of function technology
[2:25:16.100 --> 2:25:18.100]  for SARS
[2:25:18.100 --> 2:25:20.100]  from this
[2:25:20.100 --> 2:25:22.100]  University of North Carolina lab
[2:25:22.100 --> 2:25:24.100]  and he didn't steal it
[2:25:24.100 --> 2:25:26.100]  or he or she didn't steal it
[2:25:26.100 --> 2:25:28.100]  what happened was
[2:25:28.100 --> 2:25:30.100]  if you read carefully
[2:25:30.100 --> 2:25:32.100]  to the end of the article
[2:25:32.100 --> 2:25:34.100]  acknowledgments
[2:25:34.100 --> 2:25:36.100]  they acknowledge a National Natural
[2:25:36.100 --> 2:25:38.100]  Science Foundation of China award
[2:25:38.100 --> 2:25:40.100]  so
[2:25:40.100 --> 2:25:42.100]  in other words the Chinese
[2:25:42.100 --> 2:25:44.100]  government paid them
[2:25:44.100 --> 2:25:46.100]  to have one of their top
[2:25:46.100 --> 2:25:48.100]  biological
[2:25:48.100 --> 2:25:50.100]  warfare experts
[2:25:50.100 --> 2:25:52.100]  involved in this type
[2:25:52.100 --> 2:25:54.100]  of
[2:25:54.100 --> 2:25:56.100]  by the way Dr. Boyle stay right there
[2:25:56.100 --> 2:25:58.100]  sure I'm reading the paper
[2:25:58.100 --> 2:26:00.100]  I know you have big news you sent us
[2:26:00.100 --> 2:26:02.100]  links but I'm just now reading it
[2:26:02.100 --> 2:26:04.100]  and
[2:26:04.100 --> 2:26:06.100]  you talk about smoking gun this is the Chinese
[2:26:06.100 --> 2:26:08.100]  government paying for the exact same
[2:26:08.100 --> 2:26:10.100]  thing with a US lab
[2:26:10.100 --> 2:26:12.100]  how did you discover this
[2:26:12.100 --> 2:26:14.100]  this is smoking gun how the hell did you find
[2:26:14.100 --> 2:26:16.100]  this
[2:26:16.100 --> 2:26:18.100]  well Alex I
[2:26:18.100 --> 2:26:20.100]  told you that it's part of my
[2:26:20.100 --> 2:26:22.100]  professional responsibilities to
[2:26:22.100 --> 2:26:24.100]  stay on top of
[2:26:24.100 --> 2:26:26.100]  biological warfare so
[2:26:26.100 --> 2:26:28.100]  I came across it
[2:26:28.100 --> 2:26:30.100]  in my research that's
[2:26:30.100 --> 2:26:32.100]  just part of the job
[2:26:32.100 --> 2:26:34.100]  you're explaining it very well sir but just
[2:26:34.100 --> 2:26:36.100]  dumb it down
[2:26:36.100 --> 2:26:38.100]  our next guest is great we're going to move into
[2:26:38.100 --> 2:26:40.100]  tomorrow this is too big you've got time
[2:26:40.100 --> 2:26:42.100]  so dumb it down everybody
[2:26:42.100 --> 2:26:44.100]  why these two papers are so smoking gun
[2:26:44.100 --> 2:26:46.100]  because I'm sitting there look at this this is incredible
[2:26:46.100 --> 2:26:48.100]  this is unbelievable
[2:26:48.100 --> 2:26:50.100]  I have more than that
[2:26:50.100 --> 2:26:52.100]  they acknowledge
[2:26:52.100 --> 2:26:54.100]  the National Science Foundation of China
[2:26:54.100 --> 2:26:56.100]  work so in other words
[2:26:56.100 --> 2:26:58.100]  these death scientists
[2:26:58.100 --> 2:27:00.100]  at the University of North Carolina
[2:27:00.100 --> 2:27:02.100]  took dirty money
[2:27:02.100 --> 2:27:04.100]  from China
[2:27:04.100 --> 2:27:06.100]  to allow that one of their
[2:27:06.100 --> 2:27:08.100]  top
[2:27:08.100 --> 2:27:10.100]  biowarfare experts
[2:27:10.100 --> 2:27:12.100]  from this Wuhan Institute of
[2:27:12.100 --> 2:27:14.100]  Virology in Wuhan
[2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:16.100]  which has the BSL4 facility
[2:27:16.100 --> 2:27:18.100]  they knew exactly what they were doing
[2:27:18.100 --> 2:27:20.100]  and they permitted this Chinese
[2:27:20.100 --> 2:27:22.100]  scientist to work with them
[2:27:22.100 --> 2:27:24.100]  to give gain of function
[2:27:24.100 --> 2:27:26.100]  biowarfare
[2:27:26.100 --> 2:27:28.100]  DNA genetic
[2:27:28.100 --> 2:27:30.100]  capability to SARS
[2:27:30.100 --> 2:27:32.100]  which is dangerous enough
[2:27:32.100 --> 2:27:34.100]  to begin with
[2:27:34.100 --> 2:27:36.100]  and let me just go through
[2:27:36.100 --> 2:27:38.100]  some of the language here
[2:27:38.100 --> 2:27:40.100]  it is truly
[2:27:40.100 --> 2:27:42.100]  a smoking gun
[2:27:42.100 --> 2:27:44.100]  clearly that laboratory must be shut down
[2:27:44.100 --> 2:27:46.100]  immediately
[2:27:46.100 --> 2:27:48.100]  and all those scientists
[2:27:48.100 --> 2:27:50.100]  investigated by the United States
[2:27:50.100 --> 2:27:52.100]  government for this
[2:27:52.100 --> 2:27:54.100]  and their responsibility here
[2:27:54.100 --> 2:27:56.100]  for violating my biological weapons
[2:27:56.100 --> 2:27:58.100]  anti-terrorism act of 1989
[2:27:58.100 --> 2:28:00.100]  but let me continue
[2:28:00.100 --> 2:28:02.100]  this is what they said
[2:28:02.100 --> 2:28:04.100]  we built a chimeric virus
[2:28:04.100 --> 2:28:06.100]  that encodes a novel zoonotic
[2:28:06.100 --> 2:28:08.100]  spike protein
[2:28:08.100 --> 2:28:10.100]  in the context of viable
[2:28:10.100 --> 2:28:12.100]  SARS
[2:28:12.100 --> 2:28:14.100]  this approach
[2:28:14.100 --> 2:28:16.100]  characterized the threat posed
[2:28:16.100 --> 2:28:18.100]  by SARS coronavirus spike
[2:28:18.100 --> 2:28:20.100]  Dr. Boyle stay there
[2:28:20.100 --> 2:28:22.100]  we got to go to break
[2:28:22.100 --> 2:28:24.100]  I'm reading the paper right here
[2:28:24.100 --> 2:28:26.100]  they are admitting that they built
[2:28:26.100 --> 2:28:28.100]  the very virus that China
[2:28:28.100 --> 2:28:30.100]  paid the U.S. to build
[2:28:30.100 --> 2:28:32.100]  and now that's been released
[2:28:32.100 --> 2:28:34.100]  and why did they release them?
[2:28:34.100 --> 2:28:36.100]  Wow this is unbelievable
[2:28:36.100 --> 2:28:38.100]  no matter what you've ever heard
[2:28:38.100 --> 2:28:40.100]  on the show this is the craziest
[2:28:40.100 --> 2:28:42.100]  and the most documented
[2:28:42.100 --> 2:28:44.100]  this is over the top
[2:28:44.100 --> 2:28:46.100]  red handed
[2:28:46.100 --> 2:28:48.100]  unbelievable we'll be right back
[2:28:48.100 --> 2:28:50.100]  tell everybody you know what you're doing right now
[2:28:50.100 --> 2:29:18.100]  we'll be right back
[2:29:18.100 --> 2:29:20.100]  we'll be right back
[2:29:48.100 --> 2:29:50.100]  go to myownpowergrid.com
[2:29:50.100 --> 2:30:18.100]  go to myownpowergrid.com
[2:30:20.100 --> 2:30:40.100]  go to myownpowergrid.com
[2:30:40.100 --> 2:30:42.100]  you've taken the very element
[2:30:42.100 --> 2:30:44.100]  that they try to repress you with
[2:30:44.100 --> 2:30:46.100]  that silence
[2:30:46.100 --> 2:30:48.100]  and made it into a weapon
[2:30:48.100 --> 2:30:50.100]  and you know what's most disturbing to people?
[2:30:50.100 --> 2:30:52.100]  silence
[2:30:52.100 --> 2:31:18.100]  music
[2:31:18.100 --> 2:31:46.100]  go to myownpowergrid.com
[2:31:46.100 --> 2:31:54.100]  silence
[2:31:54.100 --> 2:31:56.100]  the evidence is overwhelming
[2:31:56.100 --> 2:31:58.100]  coronavirus is a man-made
[2:31:58.100 --> 2:32:00.100]  vital weapon designed
[2:32:00.100 --> 2:32:02.100]  to destroy nation states
[2:32:02.100 --> 2:32:04.100]  economies and free peoples
[2:32:04.100 --> 2:32:06.100]  and usher in a planetary government
[2:32:06.100 --> 2:32:08.100]  this is how the globalists are striking back
[2:32:08.100 --> 2:32:10.100]  here's a fortune headline today
[2:32:10.100 --> 2:32:12.100]  fears of global coronavirus
[2:32:12.100 --> 2:32:14.100]  contagion rage
[2:32:14.100 --> 2:32:16.100]  3,000 cruise ship passengers
[2:32:16.100 --> 2:32:18.100]  return home
[2:32:18.100 --> 2:32:20.100]  and that's just in one nation
[2:32:20.100 --> 2:32:22.100]  coronavirus deals major blow
[2:32:22.100 --> 2:32:24.100]  to german car factories in china
[2:32:24.100 --> 2:32:26.100]  the reporting it could cut
[2:32:26.100 --> 2:32:28.100]  their sales in half
[2:32:28.100 --> 2:32:30.100]  this year
[2:32:30.100 --> 2:32:32.100]  that's how major this is
[2:32:32.100 --> 2:32:34.100]  everyone needs to be
[2:32:34.100 --> 2:32:36.100]  prepared
[2:32:36.100 --> 2:32:38.100]  2020 is not a year to play games
[2:32:38.100 --> 2:32:40.100]  info wars will continue to report
[2:32:40.100 --> 2:32:42.100]  the latest information as it comes out
[2:32:42.100 --> 2:32:44.100]  regardless of the fact that the establishment
[2:32:44.100 --> 2:32:46.100]  will try to punish us
[2:32:46.100 --> 2:32:48.100]  for telling the truth
[2:32:48.100 --> 2:32:50.100]  we need you to step into the plate
[2:32:50.100 --> 2:32:52.100]  and help spread the word about band.video
[2:32:52.100 --> 2:32:54.100]  and infowars.com today
[2:32:54.100 --> 2:32:58.100]  music
[2:32:58.100 --> 2:33:00.100]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:00.100 --> 2:33:10.100]  music
[2:33:10.100 --> 2:33:12.100]  you thought the lead in winter
[2:33:12.100 --> 2:33:14.100]  would bring you down forever
[2:33:14.100 --> 2:33:16.100]  but you rode upon a steamer
[2:33:16.100 --> 2:33:18.100]  to the violence of the sun
[2:33:18.100 --> 2:33:20.100]  music
[2:33:20.100 --> 2:33:22.100]  broadcasting live from the un
[2:33:22.100 --> 2:33:24.100]  stronghold austin texas
[2:33:24.100 --> 2:33:26.100]  you're listening to the alex
[2:33:26.100 --> 2:33:28.100]  jones show
[2:33:28.100 --> 2:33:30.100]  music
[2:33:30.100 --> 2:33:32.100]  show i don't want to get metaphysical here
[2:33:32.100 --> 2:33:34.100]  but my dad is a retire
[2:33:34.100 --> 2:33:36.100]  oral surgeon and dentist
[2:33:36.100 --> 2:33:38.100]  and he's also developed some drugs
[2:33:38.100 --> 2:33:40.100]  that got approved with a pentagon
[2:33:40.100 --> 2:33:42.100]  and done some other things
[2:33:42.100 --> 2:33:44.100]  and he's got an office over here
[2:33:44.100 --> 2:33:46.100]  and he works here part time
[2:33:46.100 --> 2:33:48.100]  and there was something about today's show
[2:33:48.100 --> 2:33:50.100]  with dr boil coming on
[2:33:50.100 --> 2:33:52.100]  i said you know my dad's got that skull
[2:33:52.100 --> 2:33:54.100]  from medical school
[2:33:54.100 --> 2:33:56.100]  that's a real skull
[2:33:56.100 --> 2:33:58.100]  and one of my earliest memories
[2:33:58.100 --> 2:34:00.100]  being like two three years old
[2:34:00.100 --> 2:34:02.100]  and you know this skull was in a black box
[2:34:02.100 --> 2:34:04.100]  and i like tautled over and opened it up
[2:34:04.100 --> 2:34:06.100]  dropping on the floor and the german shepherd ran out
[2:34:06.100 --> 2:34:08.100]  he said that's important you need to respect that
[2:34:08.100 --> 2:34:10.100]  that's a real skull
[2:34:10.100 --> 2:34:12.100]  so one of my earliest memories is the german shepherd running out
[2:34:12.100 --> 2:34:14.100]  the backyard of this skull
[2:34:14.100 --> 2:34:16.100]  but it's just funny i thought today's show
[2:34:16.100 --> 2:34:18.100]  i didn't know why i just went and said
[2:34:18.100 --> 2:34:20.100]  dad can i put your skull on there
[2:34:20.100 --> 2:34:22.100]  because he's got it in the office over there
[2:34:22.100 --> 2:34:24.100]  he said yeah i just respect the skull
[2:34:24.100 --> 2:34:26.100]  everything is mine
[2:34:26.100 --> 2:34:28.100]  but the point is is that
[2:34:28.100 --> 2:34:30.100]  this is real something big is going on
[2:34:30.100 --> 2:34:32.100]  and now i'm looking at all these prestigious reports
[2:34:32.100 --> 2:34:34.100]  going back five years ago
[2:34:34.100 --> 2:34:36.100]  they engineered this
[2:34:36.100 --> 2:34:38.100]  and dr frances boil wrote
[2:34:38.100 --> 2:34:40.100]  the u.s. biological weapons
[2:34:40.100 --> 2:34:42.100]  law
[2:34:42.100 --> 2:34:44.100]  and he's here laying this out
[2:34:44.100 --> 2:34:46.100]  and i can read the reports
[2:34:46.100 --> 2:34:48.100]  it's ridiculous how obvious this is
[2:34:48.100 --> 2:34:50.100]  that the chinese
[2:34:50.100 --> 2:34:52.100]  paid
[2:34:52.100 --> 2:34:54.100]  a u.s.
[2:34:54.100 --> 2:34:56.100]  university that's all over the news
[2:34:56.100 --> 2:34:58.100]  yale and harvard
[2:34:58.100 --> 2:35:00.100]  are in trouble for 300 something million
[2:35:00.100 --> 2:35:02.100]  but it turns out it's billions total
[2:35:02.100 --> 2:35:04.100]  street journal new york times
[2:35:04.100 --> 2:35:06.100]  for chinese communist funding
[2:35:06.100 --> 2:35:08.100]  so for whatever reason we're better at science
[2:35:08.100 --> 2:35:10.100]  than they are and they're getting
[2:35:10.100 --> 2:35:12.100]  us to finance and build their surveillance grid
[2:35:12.100 --> 2:35:14.100]  all of it so
[2:35:14.100 --> 2:35:16.100]  for whatever
[2:35:16.100 --> 2:35:18.100]  archetypal reason today
[2:35:18.100 --> 2:35:20.100]  i'm like i want a skull
[2:35:20.100 --> 2:35:22.100]  on the show today
[2:35:22.100 --> 2:35:24.100]  i might have showed this skull in 20 something years on air
[2:35:24.100 --> 2:35:26.100]  once or twice
[2:35:26.100 --> 2:35:28.100]  and why did i go get the skull i just thought like
[2:35:28.100 --> 2:35:30.100]  today i should like
[2:35:30.100 --> 2:35:32.100]  do that to point out that we're all human
[2:35:32.100 --> 2:35:34.100]  and
[2:35:34.100 --> 2:35:36.100]  it's like mcbeth you know sitting there
[2:35:36.100 --> 2:35:38.100]  when they dig up his old teacher and he's talking to the skull
[2:35:38.100 --> 2:35:40.100]  so
[2:35:40.100 --> 2:35:42.100]  that's all in the middle of this
[2:35:42.100 --> 2:35:44.100]  dr boil please go back
[2:35:44.100 --> 2:35:46.100]  to where you were before we went to break
[2:35:46.100 --> 2:35:48.100]  and how big this is
[2:35:48.100 --> 2:35:50.100]  and what's breaking here and the double
[2:35:50.100 --> 2:35:52.100]  smoking guns here and even more
[2:35:52.100 --> 2:35:54.100]  you've got of
[2:35:54.100 --> 2:35:56.100]  where this came from because that will give us
[2:35:56.100 --> 2:35:58.100]  the answer hopefully of where it's going
[2:35:58.100 --> 2:36:00.100]  right well to continue
[2:36:00.100 --> 2:36:02.100]  then it says
[2:36:02.100 --> 2:36:04.100]  this approach characterized
[2:36:04.100 --> 2:36:06.100]  the threat posed
[2:36:06.100 --> 2:36:08.100]  by a spike
[2:36:08.100 --> 2:36:10.100]  in primary human airways
[2:36:10.100 --> 2:36:12.100]  so in other words
[2:36:12.100 --> 2:36:14.100]  they're designing this
[2:36:14.100 --> 2:36:16.100]  to infect human beings
[2:36:16.100 --> 2:36:18.100]  by their airways
[2:36:18.100 --> 2:36:20.100]  and that says in vivo
[2:36:20.100 --> 2:36:22.100]  so in other words they are using
[2:36:22.100 --> 2:36:24.100]  live animals slow down
[2:36:24.100 --> 2:36:26.100]  and start over
[2:36:26.100 --> 2:36:28.100]  and give them the papers name again this is
[2:36:28.100 --> 2:36:30.100]  this is so huge they're making it
[2:36:30.100 --> 2:36:32.100]  to infect people you're right they should be arrested
[2:36:32.100 --> 2:36:34.100]  of course
[2:36:34.100 --> 2:36:36.100]  they should be prosecuted no question at all
[2:36:36.100 --> 2:36:38.100]  about it that's
[2:36:38.100 --> 2:36:40.100]  the i think the one you already had up there
[2:36:40.100 --> 2:36:42.100]  but in any way i'm gonna stop interrupting just recap
[2:36:42.100 --> 2:36:44.100]  what you just said walk through this again
[2:36:44.100 --> 2:36:46.100]  right we built a chimera
[2:36:46.100 --> 2:36:48.100]  virus so they joined
[2:36:48.100 --> 2:36:50.100]  these different biological warfare
[2:36:50.100 --> 2:36:52.100]  agents together
[2:36:52.100 --> 2:36:54.100]  into a camera as i told
[2:36:54.100 --> 2:36:56.100]  you swine flu
[2:36:56.100 --> 2:36:58.100]  as you said three weeks ago it's a chimera
[2:36:58.100 --> 2:37:00.100]  chimera right
[2:37:00.100 --> 2:37:02.100]  and here they are doing it
[2:37:02.100 --> 2:37:04.100]  to have a quote spike
[2:37:04.100 --> 2:37:06.100]  in primary human airways
[2:37:06.100 --> 2:37:08.100]  cells in vivo
[2:37:08.100 --> 2:37:10.100]  that surrogates with for
[2:37:10.100 --> 2:37:12.100]  us okay now
[2:37:12.100 --> 2:37:14.100]  if you
[2:37:14.100 --> 2:37:16.100]  if you continue here they took
[2:37:16.100 --> 2:37:18.100]  mice
[2:37:18.100 --> 2:37:20.100]  and they
[2:37:20.100 --> 2:37:22.100]  with their
[2:37:22.100 --> 2:37:24.100]  technique here found
[2:37:24.100 --> 2:37:26.100]  robust replication
[2:37:26.100 --> 2:37:28.100]  comparable to SARS
[2:37:28.100 --> 2:37:30.100]  wonderful
[2:37:30.100 --> 2:37:32.100]  they're using the gain
[2:37:32.100 --> 2:37:34.100]  of function technology
[2:37:34.100 --> 2:37:36.100]  they're testing it to make sure it spreads quickly
[2:37:36.100 --> 2:37:38.100]  that's right
[2:37:38.100 --> 2:37:40.100]  and it's not just SARS
[2:37:40.100 --> 2:37:42.100]  it's gain of function
[2:37:42.100 --> 2:37:44.100]  together the data
[2:37:44.100 --> 2:37:46.100]  confirmed the ability to infect
[2:37:46.100 --> 2:37:48.100]  human airway cells
[2:37:48.100 --> 2:37:50.100]  etc so they know
[2:37:50.100 --> 2:37:52.100]  exactly
[2:37:52.100 --> 2:37:54.100]  what they are doing here
[2:37:54.100 --> 2:37:56.100]  so you've I mean just like Ford makes
[2:37:56.100 --> 2:37:58.100]  F-150 trucks you just found
[2:37:58.100 --> 2:38:00.100]  who made this and they're openly bragging about it
[2:38:00.100 --> 2:38:02.100]  right let me
[2:38:02.100 --> 2:38:04.100]  continue together the data indicate
[2:38:04.100 --> 2:38:06.100]  the viruses using
[2:38:06.100 --> 2:38:08.100]  utilizing what they
[2:38:08.100 --> 2:38:10.100]  put together are capable
[2:38:10.100 --> 2:38:12.100]  of inducing considerable
[2:38:12.100 --> 2:38:14.100]  disease in mice
[2:38:14.100 --> 2:38:16.100]  in the context of
[2:38:16.100 --> 2:38:18.100]  basically SARS
[2:38:18.100 --> 2:38:20.100]  and again SARS is the same
[2:38:20.100 --> 2:38:22.100]  coronavirus family
[2:38:22.100 --> 2:38:24.100]  right it's weaponized
[2:38:24.100 --> 2:38:26.100]  coronavirus they also
[2:38:26.100 --> 2:38:28.100]  conclude that they really
[2:38:28.100 --> 2:38:30.100]  couldn't find an
[2:38:30.100 --> 2:38:32.100]  antibody against it
[2:38:32.100 --> 2:38:34.100]  so it's extremely dangerous
[2:38:34.100 --> 2:38:36.100]  total total
[2:38:36.100 --> 2:38:38.100]  so let me
[2:38:38.100 --> 2:38:40.100]  continue then
[2:38:40.100 --> 2:38:42.100]  with this
[2:38:42.100 --> 2:38:44.100]  I'm just starting to ask you know
[2:38:44.100 --> 2:38:46.100]  these people better be arrested really quick
[2:38:46.100 --> 2:38:48.100]  right now let me
[2:38:48.100 --> 2:38:50.100]  continue here
[2:38:50.100 --> 2:38:52.100]  where they say
[2:38:52.100 --> 2:38:54.100]  their new
[2:38:54.100 --> 2:38:56.100]  DNA genetically engineered
[2:38:56.100 --> 2:38:58.100]  virus constitutes a gain
[2:38:58.100 --> 2:39:00.100]  in pathogenesis
[2:39:00.100 --> 2:39:02.100]  that's gain of function right there they admit it
[2:39:02.100 --> 2:39:04.100]  pathogenesis means
[2:39:04.100 --> 2:39:06.100]  lethality
[2:39:06.100 --> 2:39:08.100]  and infectiousness
[2:39:08.100 --> 2:39:10.100]  and we know that even Lancet has said
[2:39:10.100 --> 2:39:12.100]  lethality is about 15%
[2:39:12.100 --> 2:39:14.100]  if you disaggregate
[2:39:14.100 --> 2:39:16.100]  numbers even put out by the
[2:39:16.100 --> 2:39:18.100]  Chinese government it's about
[2:39:18.100 --> 2:39:20.100]  17%
[2:39:20.100 --> 2:39:22.100]  so
[2:39:22.100 --> 2:39:24.100]  together these data and represent
[2:39:24.100 --> 2:39:26.100]  a crossroads of gain of function
[2:39:26.100 --> 2:39:28.100]  research concerns
[2:39:30.100 --> 2:39:32.100]  and they just make it clear
[2:39:32.100 --> 2:39:34.100]  they are going to continue anyway
[2:39:34.100 --> 2:39:36.100]  they also point out
[2:39:36.100 --> 2:39:38.100]  that they
[2:39:38.100 --> 2:39:40.100]  involve HIV based
[2:39:40.100 --> 2:39:42.100]  pseudo virus
[2:39:42.100 --> 2:39:44.100]  prepared as previously described
[2:39:44.100 --> 2:39:46.100]  which is what the Indians found
[2:39:46.100 --> 2:39:48.100]  oh my god
[2:39:48.100 --> 2:39:50.100]  that's why I was going to get to that
[2:39:50.100 --> 2:39:52.100]  yes
[2:39:52.100 --> 2:39:54.100]  this is ridiculous
[2:39:54.100 --> 2:39:56.100]  no no
[2:39:56.100 --> 2:39:58.100]  this is the type of Nazi
[2:39:58.100 --> 2:40:00.100]  warfare work these scientists do
[2:40:00.100 --> 2:40:02.100]  I agree but they're publishing
[2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:04.100]  they're admitting they did it
[2:40:04.100 --> 2:40:06.100]  and let me
[2:40:06.100 --> 2:40:08.100]  continue Alex
[2:40:08.100 --> 2:40:10.100]  in a footnote it says
[2:40:10.100 --> 2:40:12.100]  they were originally obtained
[2:40:12.100 --> 2:40:14.100]  from Fort Detrick
[2:40:14.100 --> 2:40:16.100]  that's our
[2:40:16.100 --> 2:40:18.100]  so that means the US government
[2:40:18.100 --> 2:40:20.100]  was running this
[2:40:20.100 --> 2:40:22.100]  they were involved in it too
[2:40:22.100 --> 2:40:24.100]  yes
[2:40:24.100 --> 2:40:26.100]  so let me ask you this
[2:40:26.100 --> 2:40:28.100]  when you learned this this weekend what was it like
[2:40:28.100 --> 2:40:30.100]  was your heart beating faster
[2:40:30.100 --> 2:40:32.100]  no I
[2:40:32.100 --> 2:40:34.100]  decided to
[2:40:34.100 --> 2:40:36.100]  notify your assistant there Monday morning
[2:40:36.100 --> 2:40:38.100]  and then
[2:40:38.100 --> 2:40:40.100]  CNN in India
[2:40:40.100 --> 2:40:42.100]  did an interview
[2:40:42.100 --> 2:40:44.100]  with me on this but that was only
[2:40:44.100 --> 2:40:46.100]  for about 20 minutes and then I had to go back
[2:40:46.100 --> 2:40:48.100]  to my teaching but you know
[2:40:48.100 --> 2:40:50.100]  this is what I do professionally
[2:40:50.100 --> 2:40:52.100]  this is unbelievable I'm reading the report
[2:40:52.100 --> 2:40:54.100]  right here from five years ago
[2:40:54.100 --> 2:40:56.100]  obviously I don't think the university
[2:40:56.100 --> 2:40:58.100]  knew that this would be used for this but
[2:40:58.100 --> 2:41:00.100]  what did they think they were doing when they were giving
[2:41:00.100 --> 2:41:02.100]  a foreign authoritarian government
[2:41:02.100 --> 2:41:04.100]  a bio weapon
[2:41:04.100 --> 2:41:06.100]  right well
[2:41:06.100 --> 2:41:08.100]  it's all Greek
[2:41:08.100 --> 2:41:10.100]  they were paid for it
[2:41:10.100 --> 2:41:12.100]  they just take the money like you said three weeks ago
[2:41:12.100 --> 2:41:14.100]  from communist China
[2:41:14.100 --> 2:41:16.100]  and their top bio warfare expert
[2:41:16.100 --> 2:41:18.100]  here's an example I own 50 caliber rifles
[2:41:18.100 --> 2:41:20.100]  if a known criminal
[2:41:20.100 --> 2:41:22.100]  came to me and said I want to buy them
[2:41:22.100 --> 2:41:24.100]  I'd say hell no you don't give criminals
[2:41:24.100 --> 2:41:26.100]  50 caliber rifles well 50 caliber rifles
[2:41:26.100 --> 2:41:28.100]  dangerous but nothing compared to this
[2:41:28.100 --> 2:41:30.100]  what the hell is going on
[2:41:30.100 --> 2:41:32.100]  how are US weapons
[2:41:32.100 --> 2:41:34.100]  research laboratories
[2:41:34.100 --> 2:41:36.100]  under the guise of safety research
[2:41:36.100 --> 2:41:38.100]  allowed to give the chai comms
[2:41:38.100 --> 2:41:40.100]  stuff like this this is you're right
[2:41:40.100 --> 2:41:42.100]  I've been on there 25 years
[2:41:42.100 --> 2:41:44.100]  I've never seen a scandal this big
[2:41:44.100 --> 2:41:46.100]  this is it's all right here
[2:41:46.100 --> 2:41:48.100]  they admit it
[2:41:48.100 --> 2:41:50.100]  it's even worse than that because
[2:41:50.100 --> 2:41:52.100]  all this work
[2:41:52.100 --> 2:41:54.100]  this biological weapons work
[2:41:54.100 --> 2:41:56.100]  involving the Wuhan
[2:41:58.100 --> 2:42:00.100]  virology
[2:42:00.100 --> 2:42:02.100]  was approved and funded by the
[2:42:02.100 --> 2:42:04.100]  national institutes of health
[2:42:04.100 --> 2:42:06.100]  wow which I've discussed with you before
[2:42:06.100 --> 2:42:08.100]  and the national institute
[2:42:08.100 --> 2:42:10.100]  of allergy and infection
[2:42:10.100 --> 2:42:12.100]  disease okay
[2:42:12.100 --> 2:42:14.100]  I told you before these agencies
[2:42:14.100 --> 2:42:16.100]  were up to their eyeballs
[2:42:16.100 --> 2:42:18.100]  in research development
[2:42:18.100 --> 2:42:20.100]  and testing
[2:42:20.100 --> 2:42:22.100]  offensive biological warfare
[2:42:22.100 --> 2:42:24.100]  weapons Dr. Boyle stay there
[2:42:24.100 --> 2:42:26.100]  you're a great professor and amazing
[2:42:26.100 --> 2:42:28.100]  we come back you've got to recap it all
[2:42:28.100 --> 2:42:30.100]  and boil it down for the average viewer
[2:42:30.100 --> 2:42:32.100]  the viewers are smart but
[2:42:32.100 --> 2:42:34.100]  I've been on there I'm not just being dramatic
[2:42:34.100 --> 2:42:36.100]  I've been on there 25 years I've never been this
[2:42:36.100 --> 2:42:38.100]  shell shocked I'm reading these main
[2:42:38.100 --> 2:42:40.100]  line reports we pulled these up from you
[2:42:40.100 --> 2:42:42.100]  this is it this is the very virus
[2:42:42.100 --> 2:42:44.100]  five years ago cooked up sold
[2:42:44.100 --> 2:42:46.100]  the Chinese government I know
[2:42:46.100 --> 2:42:48.100]  you don't speculate when we come back
[2:42:48.100 --> 2:42:50.100]  why is it out now what's the end
[2:42:50.100 --> 2:42:52.100]  game how bad's it gonna get
[2:42:52.100 --> 2:42:54.100]  I want to talk about
[2:42:54.100 --> 2:42:56.100]  super silver whitening toothpaste because
[2:42:56.100 --> 2:42:58.100]  I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last
[2:42:58.100 --> 2:43:00.100]  week and a half and I
[2:43:00.100 --> 2:43:02.100]  told Alex I said man this is the best toothpaste
[2:43:02.100 --> 2:43:04.100]  I've ever tried he's like well what are you doing
[2:43:04.100 --> 2:43:06.100]  just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell
[2:43:06.100 --> 2:43:08.100]  me and so here I am telling
[2:43:08.100 --> 2:43:10.100]  people super silver
[2:43:10.100 --> 2:43:12.100]  whitening toothpaste is by far
[2:43:12.100 --> 2:43:14.100]  the best toothpaste I've ever tried
[2:43:14.100 --> 2:43:16.100]  and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of
[2:43:16.100 --> 2:43:18.100]  different toothpaste and it's fluoride
[2:43:18.100 --> 2:43:20.100]  free I think the big
[2:43:20.100 --> 2:43:22.100]  difference the game changer in this is the coral
[2:43:22.100 --> 2:43:24.100]  calcium because after I brush my teeth
[2:43:24.100 --> 2:43:26.100]  with this they feel so clean
[2:43:26.100 --> 2:43:28.100]  and the toothpaste that I don't even like
[2:43:28.100 --> 2:43:30.100]  rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth
[2:43:30.100 --> 2:43:32.100]  with this it feels so good
[2:43:32.100 --> 2:43:34.100]  it feels like it feels like
[2:43:34.100 --> 2:43:36.100]  good things are happening in my mouth
[2:43:36.100 --> 2:43:38.100]  in fact I find myself brushing
[2:43:38.100 --> 2:43:40.100]  my teeth three to four
[2:43:40.100 --> 2:43:42.100]  times a day rather than just twice a day now
[2:43:42.100 --> 2:43:44.100]  because I like the way it feels
[2:43:44.100 --> 2:43:46.100]  I
[2:43:46.100 --> 2:43:48.100]  I
[2:43:48.100 --> 2:43:50.100]  I
[2:43:50.100 --> 2:43:52.100]  I
[2:43:52.100 --> 2:43:54.100]  I
[2:43:54.100 --> 2:43:56.100]  across the western world
[2:43:56.100 --> 2:43:58.100]  from high school to college sports
[2:43:58.100 --> 2:44:00.100]  to even the Olympics
[2:44:00.100 --> 2:44:02.100]  men biological men
[2:44:02.100 --> 2:44:04.100]  are winning almost all
[2:44:04.100 --> 2:44:06.100]  of the sporting events this is
[2:44:06.100 --> 2:44:08.100]  men invading women's
[2:44:08.100 --> 2:44:10.100]  faces and bullying them
[2:44:10.100 --> 2:44:12.100]  and taking their rights away
[2:44:12.100 --> 2:44:14.100]  in the name of the liberalism and openness
[2:44:14.100 --> 2:44:16.100]  and then every day I have stacks
[2:44:16.100 --> 2:44:18.100]  of news articles just like today
[2:44:18.100 --> 2:44:20.100]  UK team find under house
[2:44:20.100 --> 2:44:22.100]  arrest for asking trans police
[2:44:22.100 --> 2:44:24.100]  officers gender and it hurt their
[2:44:24.100 --> 2:44:26.100]  feelings UK mother
[2:44:26.100 --> 2:44:28.100]  spared jail for misgendering
[2:44:28.100 --> 2:44:30.100]  trans woman ordered to pay
[2:44:30.100 --> 2:44:32.100]  thousand pound fine because
[2:44:32.100 --> 2:44:34.100]  it could have caused anxiety
[2:44:34.100 --> 2:44:36.100]  in the new royalty
[2:44:36.100 --> 2:44:38.100]  that's the thought police
[2:44:38.100 --> 2:44:40.100]  if a leftist has their feelings
[2:44:40.100 --> 2:44:42.100]  hurt for any reason you get
[2:44:42.100 --> 2:44:44.100]  fined and you go to jail
[2:44:44.100 --> 2:44:46.100]  this is tyranny these people are
[2:44:46.100 --> 2:44:48.100]  bullies and it's sick and it's
[2:44:48.100 --> 2:44:50.100]  evil and it's part of a scientific
[2:44:50.100 --> 2:44:52.100]  anti-human takeover resist
[2:44:52.100 --> 2:44:54.100]  it speak out against it
[2:44:54.100 --> 2:44:56.100]  we know that the global
[2:44:56.100 --> 2:44:58.100]  is in trouble humanity
[2:44:58.100 --> 2:45:00.100]  is waking up to their tyranny
[2:45:00.100 --> 2:45:02.100]  how they run their scams their Ponzi
[2:45:02.100 --> 2:45:04.100]  schemes how they're building a post-human
[2:45:04.100 --> 2:45:06.100]  world but we know they're going
[2:45:06.100 --> 2:45:08.100]  to strike back and the UN has said
[2:45:08.100 --> 2:45:10.100]  they're going to absolutely
[2:45:10.100 --> 2:45:12.100]  implode third world countries
[2:45:12.100 --> 2:45:14.100]  and then use those giant populations
[2:45:14.100 --> 2:45:16.100]  as weaponized hordes
[2:45:16.100 --> 2:45:18.100]  to come in and overwhelm the west
[2:45:18.100 --> 2:45:20.100]  and collapse our social services
[2:45:20.100 --> 2:45:22.100]  in a giant cloud and piven program
[2:45:22.100 --> 2:45:24.100]  the UN also has said
[2:45:24.100 --> 2:45:26.100]  they'll use mass plagues to make us
[2:45:26.100 --> 2:45:28.100]  capitulate to world government
[2:45:28.100 --> 2:45:30.100]  inner coronavirus
[2:45:30.100 --> 2:45:32.100]  this is a critical year
[2:45:32.100 --> 2:45:34.100]  and it's a critical time to stay
[2:45:34.100 --> 2:45:36.100]  informed and to be spreading
[2:45:36.100 --> 2:45:38.100]  the word because people are waking up
[2:45:38.100 --> 2:45:40.100]  like never before but this
[2:45:40.100 --> 2:45:42.100]  fight against tyranny is neck and neck
[2:45:42.100 --> 2:45:44.100]  so spread the word about band.video
[2:45:44.100 --> 2:45:46.100]  and infullwars.com
[2:45:46.100 --> 2:45:48.100]  forward slash show that is so
[2:45:48.100 --> 2:45:50.100]  important you are
[2:45:50.100 --> 2:45:52.100]  at the center of the resistance
[2:45:52.100 --> 2:45:54.100]  you are our only hope
[2:45:54.100 --> 2:45:56.100]  there can no longer be any doubt
[2:45:56.100 --> 2:45:58.100]  this coronavirus
[2:45:58.100 --> 2:46:00.100]  is serious on multiple
[2:46:00.100 --> 2:46:02.100]  levels it's very communicable
[2:46:02.100 --> 2:46:04.100]  it spreads very very fast
[2:46:04.100 --> 2:46:06.100]  it is killing a lot of people
[2:46:06.100 --> 2:46:08.100]  and the Chinese communist government
[2:46:08.100 --> 2:46:10.100]  has covered up just how bad it is
[2:46:10.100 --> 2:46:12.100]  and the White House is now openly challenging them
[2:46:12.100 --> 2:46:14.100]  show our Trump's top
[2:46:14.100 --> 2:46:16.100]  scientist and so is Senator Cotton
[2:46:16.100 --> 2:46:18.100]  my friends now
[2:46:18.100 --> 2:46:20.100]  is the time to get prepared
[2:46:20.100 --> 2:46:22.100]  2020 is not
[2:46:22.100 --> 2:46:24.100]  a year to play games with
[2:46:24.100 --> 2:46:26.100]  the globalist are trying to create
[2:46:26.100 --> 2:46:28.100]  economic collapse, race riots
[2:46:28.100 --> 2:46:30.100]  we don't know how bad this virus is going to get here
[2:46:30.100 --> 2:46:32.100]  that's why listeners to info wars
[2:46:32.100 --> 2:46:34.100]  need to be prepared

[2:47:24.100 --> 2:47:26.100]  like three or four weeks ago
[2:47:26.100 --> 2:47:28.100]  why aren't you promoting
[2:47:28.100 --> 2:47:30.100]  well we're always promoting high quality
[2:47:30.100 --> 2:47:32.100]  storeable foods
[2:47:32.100 --> 2:47:34.100]  but with all that's happening
[2:47:34.100 --> 2:47:36.100]  and with the globalist trying to destabilize
[2:47:36.100 --> 2:47:38.100]  things now is the time to get

[2:47:50.100 --> 2:47:52.100]  they're running 24 hours a day
[2:47:52.100 --> 2:47:54.100]  I hope everything turns out
[2:47:54.100 --> 2:47:56.100]  okay with the coronavirus
[2:47:56.100 --> 2:47:58.100]  it's already out of control
[2:47:58.100 --> 2:48:00.100]  but I hope that it planes off
[2:48:00.100 --> 2:48:02.100]  other saying it'll be a new yearly flu
[2:48:02.100 --> 2:48:04.100]  it's going to mutate and it's going to kill tens of millions
[2:48:04.100 --> 2:48:06.100]  Bill Gates says in Africa alone
[2:48:06.100 --> 2:48:08.100]  but I have storeable food because
[2:48:08.100 --> 2:48:10.100]  I want to shit on top
[2:48:10.100 --> 2:48:12.100]  of

[2:48:14.100 --> 2:48:16.100]  I've got some insurance
[2:48:16.100 --> 2:48:18.100]  things like that but insurance you can
[2:48:18.100 --> 2:48:20.100]  eat like ants
[2:48:20.100 --> 2:48:22.100]  bringing food down to their
[2:48:24.100 --> 2:48:26.100]  their world instead of a grasshopper
[2:48:26.100 --> 2:48:28.100]  that dies in the winter is so fundamental
[2:48:28.100 --> 2:48:30.100]  so go to infowarstore.com
[2:48:30.100 --> 2:48:32.100]  my patron supply is our big sponsor

[2:49:04.100 --> 2:49:06.100]  during this crisis but we were already
[2:49:06.100 --> 2:49:08.100]  promoting all of this
[2:49:08.100 --> 2:49:10.100]  and vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock
[2:49:10.100 --> 2:49:12.100]  ultra 12 really high quality
[2:49:12.100 --> 2:49:14.100]  organic sub
[2:49:14.100 --> 2:49:16.100]  lingual B12 it's back in
[2:49:16.100 --> 2:49:18.100]  and that funds our operation
[2:49:18.100 --> 2:49:20.100]  as Bloomberg and others
[2:49:20.100 --> 2:49:22.100]  finance the attempt to take us
[2:49:22.100 --> 2:49:24.100]  off air and you know I'm not going to get into
[2:49:24.100 --> 2:49:26.100]  the Bloomberg thing I made the decision this morning
[2:49:26.100 --> 2:49:28.100]  that I'm going to go ahead and get into what we've been
[2:49:28.100 --> 2:49:30.100]  given about Bloomberg financing the lawsuits against us
[2:49:30.100 --> 2:49:32.100]  just so you know how evil he is
[2:49:32.100 --> 2:49:34.100]  and I just not going to do it as some little
[2:49:34.100 --> 2:49:36.100]  afterthought here
[2:49:36.100 --> 2:49:38.100]  this is big front and center what we're covering right now
[2:49:38.100 --> 2:49:40.100]  with professor Dr. Francis
[2:49:40.100 --> 2:49:42.100]  Boyle and
[2:49:42.100 --> 2:49:44.100]  the admissions that
[2:49:44.100 --> 2:49:46.100]  a U.S. university engineered the exact
[2:49:46.100 --> 2:49:48.100]  virus now spreading across
[2:49:48.100 --> 2:49:50.100]  the world so finishing up with its providence
[2:49:50.100 --> 2:49:52.100]  the fact that these are the smoking guns
[2:49:52.100 --> 2:49:54.100]  are in synopsis
[2:49:54.100 --> 2:49:56.100]  I know that
[2:49:56.100 --> 2:49:58.100]  you know limits the time we have and I really appreciate
[2:49:58.100 --> 2:50:00.100]  come back tomorrow if you can and then get into
[2:50:00.100 --> 2:50:02.100]  big picture the response
[2:50:02.100 --> 2:50:04.100]  how you think it got out why it was
[2:50:04.100 --> 2:50:06.100]  released I mean I know that speculation
[2:50:06.100 --> 2:50:08.100]  but we know it's engineered we know the U.S. government
[2:50:08.100 --> 2:50:10.100]  knows it's engineered we know this happened before
[2:50:10.100 --> 2:50:12.100]  Trump five years ago
[2:50:12.100 --> 2:50:14.100]  but still just how the hell could this happen
[2:50:14.100 --> 2:50:16.100]  well
[2:50:16.100 --> 2:50:18.100]  let me go back here to this
[2:50:18.100 --> 2:50:20.100]  second study
[2:50:20.100 --> 2:50:22.100]  to point out
[2:50:22.100 --> 2:50:24.100]  it says at the end quote
[2:50:24.100 --> 2:50:26.100]  the current manuscript has been reviewed by the
[2:50:26.100 --> 2:50:28.100]  funding agency
[2:50:28.100 --> 2:50:30.100]  the National Institutes of Health
[2:50:30.100 --> 2:50:32.100]  continuation of these studies
[2:50:32.100 --> 2:50:34.100]  have been requested and approved
[2:50:34.100 --> 2:50:36.100]  by the National Institute of Health
[2:50:36.100 --> 2:50:38.100]  so notice the National Institute of Health
[2:50:38.100 --> 2:50:40.100]  under Fauci
[2:50:40.100 --> 2:50:42.100]  is funding
[2:50:42.100 --> 2:50:44.100]  this Nazi biological
[2:50:44.100 --> 2:50:46.100]  warfare work
[2:50:46.100 --> 2:50:48.100]  and they
[2:50:48.100 --> 2:50:50.100]  have approved
[2:50:50.100 --> 2:50:52.100]  and requested
[2:50:52.100 --> 2:50:54.100]  further development of it
[2:50:54.100 --> 2:50:56.100]  which obviously this study was
[2:50:56.100 --> 2:50:58.100]  2015
[2:50:58.100 --> 2:51:00.100]  and the NAH wanted
[2:51:00.100 --> 2:51:02.100]  to become even a
[2:51:02.100 --> 2:51:04.100]  more deadly pathogenetic
[2:51:04.100 --> 2:51:06.100]  virus
[2:51:06.100 --> 2:51:08.100]  and you can also then
[2:51:08.100 --> 2:51:10.100]  see here the money from
[2:51:10.100 --> 2:51:12.100]  the National Institute of
[2:51:12.100 --> 2:51:14.100]  Allergy and Affections Disease
[2:51:14.100 --> 2:51:16.100]  this woman I think
[2:51:16.100 --> 2:51:18.100]  you pronounce her name Lesmonier
[2:51:18.100 --> 2:51:20.100]  is out there now
[2:51:20.100 --> 2:51:22.100]  in public or she's up to her eyeballs
[2:51:22.100 --> 2:51:24.100]  in this too as is Fauci
[2:51:24.100 --> 2:51:26.100]  and finally
[2:51:26.100 --> 2:51:28.100]  I originally condemned this North Carolina
[2:51:28.100 --> 2:51:30.100]  lab
[2:51:30.100 --> 2:51:32.100]  because doing gain-of-function
[2:51:32.100 --> 2:51:34.100]  work on MERS
[2:51:34.100 --> 2:51:36.100]  as I said today in the
[2:51:36.100 --> 2:51:38.100]  USA today
[2:51:38.100 --> 2:51:40.100]  Tony Fauci admits
[2:51:40.100 --> 2:51:42.100]  that the lethality rate
[2:51:42.100 --> 2:51:44.100]  of MERS is about
[2:51:44.100 --> 2:51:46.100]  36%
[2:51:46.100 --> 2:51:48.100]  whereas SARS is 10%
[2:51:48.100 --> 2:51:50.100]  this Wuhan
[2:51:50.100 --> 2:51:52.100]  is 15 to 17%
[2:51:52.100 --> 2:51:54.100]  so notice Tony Fauci
[2:51:54.100 --> 2:51:56.100]  and the National
[2:51:56.100 --> 2:51:58.100]  Institute of Health
[2:51:58.100 --> 2:52:00.100]  are backtracking
[2:52:00.100 --> 2:52:02.100]  they know full well
[2:52:02.100 --> 2:52:04.100]  that they were paying
[2:52:04.100 --> 2:52:06.100]  this North Carolina lab
[2:52:06.100 --> 2:52:08.100]  in cooperation with the
[2:52:08.100 --> 2:52:10.100]  Wuhan BSL4
[2:52:10.100 --> 2:52:12.100]  lab and program
[2:52:12.100 --> 2:52:14.100]  to develop biological warfare
[2:52:14.100 --> 2:52:16.100]  weapons so is that why Senator
[2:52:16.100 --> 2:52:18.100]  Cotton and even the White House are like hey China
[2:52:18.100 --> 2:52:20.100]  we don't buy the Providence
[2:52:20.100 --> 2:52:22.100]  of this because they know China
[2:52:22.100 --> 2:52:24.100]  paid a U.S. University to do this
[2:52:24.100 --> 2:52:26.100]  let me ask you this then how bad is it going to be
[2:52:26.100 --> 2:52:28.100]  why did China do this I know that speculation
[2:52:28.100 --> 2:52:30.100]  is just a citizen not just a lawyer
[2:52:30.100 --> 2:52:32.100]  and an expert on this
[2:52:32.100 --> 2:52:34.100]  what the hell
[2:52:34.100 --> 2:52:36.100]  what do you think the in-game is why is this out now
[2:52:36.100 --> 2:52:38.100]  was it used against Taiwan
[2:52:38.100 --> 2:52:40.100]  we know China bought it as a bioweapon
[2:52:40.100 --> 2:52:42.100]  well
[2:52:42.100 --> 2:52:44.100]  let me just discuss
[2:52:44.100 --> 2:52:46.100]  one more
[2:52:46.100 --> 2:52:48.100]  scientific
[2:52:48.100 --> 2:52:50.100]  article with you
[2:52:50.100 --> 2:52:52.100]  archives of
[2:52:52.100 --> 2:52:54.100]  virology 2010
[2:52:54.100 --> 2:52:56.100]  pay 155
[2:52:56.100 --> 2:52:58.100]  and here
[2:52:58.100 --> 2:53:00.100]  Wuhan
[2:53:00.100 --> 2:53:02.100]  was
[2:53:02.100 --> 2:53:04.100]  working with
[2:53:04.100 --> 2:53:06.100]  an institute in
[2:53:06.100 --> 2:53:08.100]  Australia
[2:53:08.100 --> 2:53:10.100]  to DNA genetically
[2:53:10.100 --> 2:53:12.100]  engineer
[2:53:12.100 --> 2:53:14.100]  a super bioweapon
[2:53:14.100 --> 2:53:16.100]  involving
[2:53:16.100 --> 2:53:18.100]  SARS and
[2:53:18.100 --> 2:53:20.100]  HIV that's right in here
[2:53:20.100 --> 2:53:22.100]  you can read it
[2:53:22.100 --> 2:53:24.100]  okay and
[2:53:24.100 --> 2:53:26.100]  apparently was successful
[2:53:26.100 --> 2:53:28.100]  so as far as I
[2:53:28.100 --> 2:53:30.100]  can tell Alex what happened
[2:53:30.100 --> 2:53:32.100]  was
[2:53:32.100 --> 2:53:34.100]  the Wuhan Institute of
[2:53:34.100 --> 2:53:36.100]  virology took the
[2:53:36.100 --> 2:53:38.100]  and this was the
[2:53:38.100 --> 2:53:40.100]  the Australian
[2:53:40.100 --> 2:53:42.100]  government knew all about this
[2:53:42.100 --> 2:53:44.100]  and it says
[2:53:44.100 --> 2:53:46.100]  this work was jointly funded by the
[2:53:46.100 --> 2:53:48.100]  state key program for basic research
[2:53:48.100 --> 2:53:50.100]  grants from the Chinese Ministry
[2:53:50.100 --> 2:53:52.100]  of Science Technology
[2:53:52.100 --> 2:53:54.100]  and knowledge
[2:53:54.100 --> 2:53:56.100]  and the other
[2:53:56.100 --> 2:53:58.100]  the other writer here
[2:53:58.100 --> 2:54:00.100]  Australian Animal Health Laboratory
[2:54:00.100 --> 2:54:02.100]  in Australia
[2:54:02.100 --> 2:54:04.100]  so
[2:54:04.100 --> 2:54:06.100]  as far as I can figure out here
[2:54:06.100 --> 2:54:08.100]  what happened here Alex
[2:54:08.100 --> 2:54:10.100]  is that the
[2:54:10.100 --> 2:54:12.100]  Wuhan scientists
[2:54:12.100 --> 2:54:14.100]  took
[2:54:14.100 --> 2:54:16.100]  the North Carolina
[2:54:16.100 --> 2:54:18.100]  SARS
[2:54:18.100 --> 2:54:20.100]  with gain of function
[2:54:20.100 --> 2:54:22.100]  biological warfare weapon
[2:54:22.100 --> 2:54:24.100]  and they took the technology
[2:54:24.100 --> 2:54:26.100]  here behind this
[2:54:26.100 --> 2:54:28.100]  well developed SARS
[2:54:28.100 --> 2:54:30.100]  HIV weapon
[2:54:30.100 --> 2:54:32.100]  and
[2:54:32.100 --> 2:54:34.100]  they all brought it back
[2:54:34.100 --> 2:54:36.100]  to the Wuhan
[2:54:36.100 --> 2:54:38.100]  BSL floor
[2:54:38.100 --> 2:54:40.100]  and tried to
[2:54:40.100 --> 2:54:42.100]  DNA genetically
[2:54:42.100 --> 2:54:44.100]  engineered into a camera
[2:54:44.100 --> 2:54:46.100]  into
[2:54:46.100 --> 2:54:48.100]  biological warfare weapon
[2:54:48.100 --> 2:54:50.100]  involving
[2:54:50.100 --> 2:54:52.100]  the coronavirus
[2:54:52.100 --> 2:54:54.100]  the HIV virus
[2:54:54.100 --> 2:54:56.100]  and gain of function
[2:54:56.100 --> 2:54:58.100]  so it's all clear in the papers
[2:54:58.100 --> 2:55:00.100]  they admit they did this, you've reverse engineered it
[2:55:00.100 --> 2:55:02.100]  an incredible job
[2:55:02.100 --> 2:55:04.100]  do you think it was done on purpose then?
[2:55:04.100 --> 2:55:06.100]  who stands to gain? Kibono as a
[2:55:06.100 --> 2:55:08.100]  law professor
[2:55:08.100 --> 2:55:10.100]  who would do this? who stands to gain?
[2:55:10.100 --> 2:55:12.100]  well clearly
[2:55:12.100 --> 2:55:14.100]  China has an extensive
[2:55:14.100 --> 2:55:16.100]  biological warfare
[2:55:16.100 --> 2:55:18.100]  program they have
[2:55:18.100 --> 2:55:20.100]  not as extensive as ours
[2:55:20.100 --> 2:55:22.100]  we have 12 BSL
[2:55:22.100 --> 2:55:24.100]  facilities here in the United States
[2:55:24.100 --> 2:55:26.100]  all doing this
[2:55:26.100 --> 2:55:28.100]  Nazi bio warfare work
[2:55:28.100 --> 2:55:30.100]  they should all be shut down tomorrow
[2:55:30.100 --> 2:55:32.100]  totally agree and then giving China
[2:55:32.100 --> 2:55:34.100]  the fruits of it
[2:55:34.100 --> 2:55:36.100]  the Chai comms can buy
[2:55:36.100 --> 2:55:38.100]  bioweapons from us?
[2:55:38.100 --> 2:55:40.100]  they bought it
[2:55:40.100 --> 2:55:42.100]  so what is interesting here Alex
[2:55:42.100 --> 2:55:44.100]  is that they didn't steal it
[2:55:44.100 --> 2:55:46.100]  they bought it
[2:55:46.100 --> 2:55:48.100]  and we sold it to them
[2:55:48.100 --> 2:55:50.100]  they brought it back
[2:55:50.100 --> 2:55:52.100]  to that Wuhan BSL
[2:55:52.100 --> 2:55:54.100]  is there any race specificness to it?
[2:55:56.100 --> 2:55:58.100]  well as I said before
[2:55:58.100 --> 2:56:00.100]  we have seen
[2:56:00.100 --> 2:56:02.100]  one black African victim
[2:56:02.100 --> 2:56:04.100]  reported that I've seen
[2:56:04.100 --> 2:56:06.100]  so right now I am withholding judgment
[2:56:06.100 --> 2:56:08.100]  on that but the Chinese
[2:56:08.100 --> 2:56:10.100]  put all this together for themselves
[2:56:10.100 --> 2:56:12.100]  and of course they were
[2:56:12.100 --> 2:56:14.100]  planning
[2:56:14.100 --> 2:56:16.100]  to use it as biological warfare
[2:56:16.100 --> 2:56:18.100]  against us
[2:56:18.100 --> 2:56:20.100]  so do you think they got on an accident
[2:56:20.100 --> 2:56:22.100]  or what do you think?
[2:56:22.100 --> 2:56:24.100]  as of now Alex I think it was
[2:56:24.100 --> 2:56:26.100]  an accident
[2:56:28.100 --> 2:56:30.100]  that BSL4 facility had leaks
[2:56:30.100 --> 2:56:32.100]  of SARS at least twice
[2:56:32.100 --> 2:56:34.100]  before and I believe it was
[2:56:34.100 --> 2:56:36.100]  an accident and that is now
[2:56:36.100 --> 2:56:38.100]  confirmed by Chinese
[2:56:38.100 --> 2:56:40.100]  scientists themselves
[2:56:40.100 --> 2:56:42.100]  and this is the fourth study
[2:56:42.100 --> 2:56:44.100]  I want to put before you
[2:56:44.100 --> 2:56:46.100]  stay there we'll do five more minutes
[2:56:46.100 --> 2:56:48.100]  for Paul Watson takeover with Dr. Francis Boyle
[2:56:48.100 --> 2:56:50.100]  the author of the US biological weapons
[2:56:50.100 --> 2:56:52.100]  convention and all the rest of it
[2:56:52.100 --> 2:56:54.100]  I've been on there 25 years folks
[2:56:54.100 --> 2:56:56.100]  and this is just tops at all
[2:56:56.100 --> 2:56:58.100]  I mean we're talking about our children
[2:56:58.100 --> 2:57:00.100]  the whole future everything else
[2:57:00.100 --> 2:57:02.100]  I had this premonition this morning
[2:57:02.100 --> 2:57:04.100]  I said let me just get that skull
[2:57:04.100 --> 2:57:06.100]  my dad's got from his medical days
[2:57:06.100 --> 2:57:08.100]  let me bring this in here
[2:57:08.100 --> 2:57:10.100]  I'm going to go prop
[2:57:10.100 --> 2:57:12.100]  to just think about mortality
[2:57:12.100 --> 2:57:14.100]  and the fact that we're all mortal
[2:57:14.100 --> 2:57:16.100]  and there it is and now we're just laying this out
[2:57:16.100 --> 2:57:18.100]  this is just end of day stuff
[2:57:18.100 --> 2:57:20.100]  if not this it'll be something else
[2:57:20.100 --> 2:57:22.100]  I mean what are these labs doing
[2:57:22.100 --> 2:57:24.100]  why are they selling it to foreign governments
[2:57:24.100 --> 2:57:26.100]  it needs to stop
[2:57:26.100 --> 2:57:28.100]  it's mad scientist behavior
[2:57:28.100 --> 2:57:30.100]  they want to reduce world population
[2:57:30.100 --> 2:57:32.100]  they want to distribute it out
[2:57:32.100 --> 2:57:34.100]  so they can deny who did it
[2:57:34.100 --> 2:57:36.100]  they just want plausible deniability
[2:57:36.100 --> 2:57:38.100]  and mass population reduction
[2:57:38.100 --> 2:58:06.100]  that's really what's happening
[2:58:06.100 --> 2:58:08.100]  right now humanity's awakening
[2:58:08.100 --> 2:58:10.100]  it's explosive, it's powerful
[2:58:10.100 --> 2:58:12.100]  it's incredible
[2:58:12.100 --> 2:58:14.100]  but there's major obstacles coming down the road
[2:58:14.100 --> 2:58:16.100]  and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO
[2:58:16.100 --> 2:58:18.100]  and stay in the game
[2:58:18.100 --> 2:58:20.100]  like MFWR's Citizens of the Spirit

[2:58:34.100 --> 2:58:36.100]  for the NWO
[2:58:36.100 --> 2:58:38.100]  but they need the financing
[2:58:38.100 --> 2:58:40.100]  to put them in the field

[3:00:12.100 --> 3:00:14.100]  we've seen the panic response
[3:00:14.100 --> 3:00:16.100]  of governments in action
[3:00:16.100 --> 3:00:18.100]  but the propaganda is everything's fine
[3:00:18.100 --> 3:00:20.100]  Dr. Francis Boyle
[3:00:20.100 --> 3:00:22.100]  is our guest here for another 5 minutes
[3:00:22.100 --> 3:00:24.100]  Paul Joseph Watson
[3:00:24.100 --> 3:00:26.100]  is set to take back over
[3:00:26.100 --> 3:00:28.100]  our guest
[3:00:28.100 --> 3:00:30.100]  authored the U.S. Bioweapons Law
[3:00:30.100 --> 3:00:32.100]  that became international law
[3:00:32.100 --> 3:00:34.100]  so in the 4 minutes we've got left
[3:00:34.100 --> 3:00:36.100]  Dr. we really appreciate you
[3:00:36.100 --> 3:00:38.100]  synopsiting
[3:00:38.100 --> 3:00:40.100]  or boiling it all down
[3:00:40.100 --> 3:00:42.100]  to what you really think is happening
[3:00:42.100 --> 3:00:44.100]  in the bombshells
[3:00:44.100 --> 3:00:46.100]  and this new study you were trying to get into
[3:00:46.100 --> 3:00:48.100]  on top of all the other studies you just talked about
[3:00:48.100 --> 3:00:50.100]  right this is the latest
[3:00:50.100 --> 3:00:52.100]  study it just came out this week
[3:00:52.100 --> 3:00:54.100]  possible origins
[3:00:54.100 --> 3:00:56.100]  of 219
[3:00:56.100 --> 3:00:58.100]  NCOV coronavirus
[3:00:58.100 --> 3:01:00.100]  what is significant here
[3:01:00.100 --> 3:01:02.100]  you can get it at research gate
[3:01:02.100 --> 3:01:04.100]  what is significant here
[3:01:04.100 --> 3:01:06.100]  is that it is
[3:01:06.100 --> 3:01:08.100]  by two professors
[3:01:08.100 --> 3:01:10.100]  at the South China
[3:01:10.100 --> 3:01:12.100]  University of Technology
[3:01:12.100 --> 3:01:14.100]  their own professors
[3:01:14.100 --> 3:01:16.100]  at their conclusion
[3:01:16.100 --> 3:01:18.100]  of this study
[3:01:18.100 --> 3:01:20.100]  is that the Wuhan coronavirus
[3:01:20.100 --> 3:01:22.100]  leaked out
[3:01:22.100 --> 3:01:24.100]  of that BSL4 facility
[3:01:24.100 --> 3:01:26.100]  so let me repeat
[3:01:26.100 --> 3:01:28.100]  even Chinese scientists
[3:01:28.100 --> 3:01:30.100]  are saying now
[3:01:30.100 --> 3:01:32.100]  independently of me
[3:01:32.100 --> 3:01:34.100]  it leaked out
[3:01:34.100 --> 3:01:36.100]  and I believe
[3:01:36.100 --> 3:01:38.100]  it was probably an accident
[3:01:38.100 --> 3:01:40.100]  that there was
[3:01:40.100 --> 3:01:42.100]  one of these death scientists there
[3:01:42.100 --> 3:01:44.100]  at the Wuhan BSL4
[3:01:44.100 --> 3:01:46.100]  facility trying
[3:01:46.100 --> 3:01:48.100]  to
[3:01:48.100 --> 3:01:50.100]  DNA genetically engineer
[3:01:50.100 --> 3:01:52.100]  the North Carolina technology
[3:01:52.100 --> 3:01:54.100]  the Australian technology
[3:01:54.100 --> 3:01:56.100]  HIV
[3:01:56.100 --> 3:01:58.100]  SARS
[3:01:58.100 --> 3:02:00.100]  gain of function together
[3:02:00.100 --> 3:02:02.100]  into the super biological warfare
[3:02:02.100 --> 3:02:04.100]  weapon
[3:02:04.100 --> 3:02:06.100]  that somehow got infected
[3:02:06.100 --> 3:02:08.100]  there's been speculation by these authors
[3:02:08.100 --> 3:02:10.100]  that
[3:02:10.100 --> 3:02:12.100]  animal residue
[3:02:12.100 --> 3:02:14.100]  or they breathed it in
[3:02:14.100 --> 3:02:16.100]  or something like that
[3:02:16.100 --> 3:02:18.100]  that person then got infected
[3:02:18.100 --> 3:02:20.100]  but since it's
[3:02:20.100 --> 3:02:22.100]  asymptomatic they weren't aware of it
[3:02:22.100 --> 3:02:24.100]  and now
[3:02:24.100 --> 3:02:26.100]  even though they're saying it's 14 days
[3:02:26.100 --> 3:02:28.100]  a British healthcare expert
[3:02:28.100 --> 3:02:30.100]  estimated could be 24 days
[3:02:30.100 --> 3:02:32.100]  so
[3:02:32.100 --> 3:02:34.100]  whatever this expert was
[3:02:34.100 --> 3:02:36.100]  as death scientist
[3:02:36.100 --> 3:02:38.100]  went out and around and did his
[3:02:38.100 --> 3:02:40.100]  normal life activities
[3:02:40.100 --> 3:02:42.100]  for the next 14 to
[3:02:42.100 --> 3:02:44.100]  24 days and it was
[3:02:44.100 --> 3:02:46.100]  spread all around
[3:02:46.100 --> 3:02:48.100]  Wuhan
[3:02:48.100 --> 3:02:50.100]  so they were playing with fire and they got burned
[3:02:50.100 --> 3:02:52.100]  right they shot themselves
[3:02:52.100 --> 3:02:54.100]  to the foot Alex that's my
[3:02:54.100 --> 3:02:56.100]  assessment at this time yes
[3:02:56.100 --> 3:02:58.100]  they were using it
[3:02:58.100 --> 3:03:00.100]  I think they were developing
[3:03:00.100 --> 3:03:02.100]  the use against either us
[3:03:02.100 --> 3:03:04.100]  or the Russians and or the Russians
[3:03:04.100 --> 3:03:06.100]  you know they have a huge
[3:03:06.100 --> 3:03:08.100]  border up there
[3:03:08.100 --> 3:03:10.100]  Russians sign out split
[3:03:10.100 --> 3:03:12.100]  right that's no longer the case today
[3:03:12.100 --> 3:03:14.100]  but still Russia has
[3:03:14.100 --> 3:03:16.100]  a lot of land there
[3:03:16.100 --> 3:03:18.100]  and China and not very many
[3:03:18.100 --> 3:03:20.100]  people sure they can wipe out the Russians
[3:03:20.100 --> 3:03:22.100]  that's their target Laban's throw
[3:03:22.100 --> 3:03:24.100]  and China has a lot of people
[3:03:24.100 --> 3:03:26.100]  and they need more land so I'm not
[3:03:26.100 --> 3:03:28.100]  ruling out it would have been directed
[3:03:28.100 --> 3:03:30.100]  China has always been eyeing Russia
[3:03:30.100 --> 3:03:32.100]  greedily all right well powerful
[3:03:32.100 --> 3:03:34.100]  if you come back tomorrow the next day we need
[3:03:34.100 --> 3:03:36.100]  updates this is the biggest news ever
[3:03:36.100 --> 3:03:38.100]  and I'll just say that this is unbelievable
[3:03:38.100 --> 3:03:40.100]  the reports the scientific journals
[3:03:40.100 --> 3:03:42.100]  Dr. Boyle incredible
[3:03:42.100 --> 3:03:44.100]  what do we call this interview we're still
[3:03:44.100 --> 3:03:46.100]  live I mean I don't know what to call this
[3:03:46.100 --> 3:03:48.100]  once we post it on info wars
[3:03:48.100 --> 3:03:50.100]  well Alex let me also
[3:03:50.100 --> 3:03:52.100]  say we can't trust the FBI
[3:03:52.100 --> 3:03:54.100]  to do the right thing here
[3:03:54.100 --> 3:03:56.100]  they lied about they covered up
[3:03:56.100 --> 3:03:58.100]  a sabotage
[3:03:58.100 --> 3:04:00.100]  the Amerithrax
[3:04:00.100 --> 3:04:02.100]  coming out of Fort Detrick
[3:04:02.100 --> 3:04:04.100]  so we are going to have
[3:04:04.100 --> 3:04:06.100]  to get some other federal law
[3:04:06.100 --> 3:04:08.100]  investigative agencies in here
[3:04:08.100 --> 3:04:10.100]  to deal with that North Carolina
[3:04:10.100 --> 3:04:12.100]  you've authored the U.S. law and bio weapons
[3:04:12.100 --> 3:04:14.100]  so I think you're quite the authority
[3:04:14.100 --> 3:04:16.100]  on that so again
[3:04:16.100 --> 3:04:18.100]  please join us again tomorrow or whenever you can
[3:04:18.100 --> 3:04:20.100]  Dr. Boyle very powerful

[3:04:30.100 --> 3:04:32.100]  media in the United States
[3:04:32.100 --> 3:04:34.100]  Europe has been black loss
[3:04:34.100 --> 3:04:36.100]  black bullying me and black
[3:04:36.100 --> 3:04:38.100]  well sure I don't even know what to call this

[3:04:40.100 --> 3:04:42.100]  Wuhan virus man made
[3:04:42.100 --> 3:04:44.100]  spreading worldwide cover up
[3:04:44.100 --> 3:04:46.100]  I mean China bought
[3:04:46.100 --> 3:04:48.100]  weaponized Wuhan virus from U.S.
[3:04:48.100 --> 3:04:50.100]  thank you Dr. Boyle Paul Watson takes over right now

[3:06:24.100 --> 3:06:26.100]  servers on bank accounts on mortgage
[3:06:26.100 --> 3:06:28.100]  application
[3:06:28.100 --> 3:06:30.100]  over in China with the social
[3:06:30.100 --> 3:06:32.100]  credit score
[3:06:32.100 --> 3:06:34.100]  from buying train
[3:06:34.100 --> 3:06:36.100]  and plane tickets but even in China
[3:06:36.100 --> 3:06:38.100]  as of yeah
[3:06:38.100 --> 3:06:40.100]  I haven't seen anyone who's been D platformed
[3:06:40.100 --> 3:06:42.100]  from hospital treatment
[3:06:42.100 --> 3:06:44.100]  due to wrong thing
[3:06:44.100 --> 3:06:46.100]  due to their opinions to the way
[3:06:46.100 --> 3:06:48.100]  they say things due to noises that come
[3:06:48.100 --> 3:06:50.100]  out of the mouth
[3:06:50.100 --> 3:06:52.100]  and that's the situation that we have here
[3:06:52.100 --> 3:06:54.100]  in the UK
[3:06:54.100 --> 3:06:56.100]  on summit news
[3:06:56.100 --> 3:06:58.100]  UK hospital didn't I care to
[3:06:58.100 --> 3:07:00.100]  racist or homophobic
[3:07:00.100 --> 3:07:02.100]  big patients
[3:07:02.100 --> 3:07:04.100]  what could possibly go wrong
[3:07:04.100 --> 3:07:06.100]  now I thought about this
[3:07:06.100 --> 3:07:08.100]  my life
[3:07:08.100 --> 3:07:10.100]  is nothing but a comedy
[3:07:12.100 --> 3:07:14.100]  orange man
[3:07:14.100 --> 3:07:16.100]  still bad
[3:07:16.100 --> 3:07:18.100]  if you rearrange the letters in the name
[3:07:18.100 --> 3:07:20.100]  Donald Trump they spell
[3:07:20.100 --> 3:07:22.100]  plaud turd man
[3:07:22.100 --> 3:07:24.100]  so
[3:07:24.100 --> 3:07:26.100]  orange man
[3:07:26.100 --> 3:07:28.100]  bad
[3:07:30.100 --> 3:07:32.100]  orange man destroyed
[3:07:32.100 --> 3:07:34.100]  plaud turd man
[3:07:34.100 --> 3:07:36.100]  gloom

[3:07:38.100 --> 3:07:40.100]  pram
[3:07:42.100 --> 3:07:44.100]  plaud turd man
[3:07:48.100 --> 3:07:50.100]  Karen I'm home
[3:07:50.100 --> 3:07:52.100]  did you hear what drumf said
[3:07:52.100 --> 3:07:54.100]  yes I heard about drumf
[3:07:54.100 --> 3:07:56.100]  orange man bad
[3:07:56.100 --> 3:07:58.100]  change that falls out of the pockets of all the
[3:07:58.100 --> 3:08:00.100]  Santas f***ing each other
[3:08:00.100 --> 3:08:02.100]  in the nibble of Dwayne Reeves
[3:08:02.100 --> 3:08:04.100]  this is Jonathan
[3:08:04.100 --> 3:08:06.100]  he needs a place to stay tonight
[3:08:06.100 --> 3:08:08.100]  it's an honour to have you here
[3:08:08.100 --> 3:08:10.100]  we're very privileged and I'm happy
[3:08:10.100 --> 3:08:12.100]  to share everything with you
[3:08:12.100 --> 3:08:14.100]  plaud turd man
[3:08:14.100 --> 3:08:16.100]  you're not laughing I just made my 1 million
[3:08:16.100 --> 3:08:18.100]  drumf joke and you're not laughing
[3:08:18.100 --> 3:08:20.100]  the system that knows so much
[3:08:20.100 --> 3:08:22.100]  you decide
[3:08:22.100 --> 3:08:24.100]  what's right or wrong
[3:08:24.100 --> 3:08:26.100]  the same way that you decide
[3:08:26.100 --> 3:08:32.100]  what's funny
[3:08:40.100 --> 3:08:42.100]  meanwhile in the UK
[3:08:42.100 --> 3:08:44.100]  supermarket Tesco had to apologise
[3:08:44.100 --> 3:08:46.100]  for telling people not to steal
[3:08:46.100 --> 3:08:48.100]  female menstrual products
[3:08:48.100 --> 3:08:50.100]  women, trans men or anyone who menstruates
[3:08:50.100 --> 3:08:52.100]  should not have to worry about being reported
[3:08:52.100 --> 3:08:54.100]  for taking a necessity that I personally
[3:08:54.100 --> 3:08:56.100]  believe should be free
[3:08:56.100 --> 3:08:58.100]  Tesco removed signs placed above tampons
[3:08:58.100 --> 3:09:00.100]  and other menstrual health products
[3:09:00.100 --> 3:09:02.100]  that asked people to report shoplifting
[3:09:02.100 --> 3:09:04.100]  of these items in its store in Kensington London
[3:09:04.100 --> 3:09:06.100]  after the signs caused
[3:09:06.100 --> 3:09:08.100]  mass uproar online
[3:09:08.100 --> 3:09:10.100]  the company said it was very sorry
[3:09:10.100 --> 3:09:12.100]  for any offence caused and claimed that the sign
[3:09:12.100 --> 3:09:14.100]  was placed in error
[3:09:14.100 --> 3:09:16.100]  shoplifting is now progressive
[3:09:16.100 --> 3:09:18.100]  the contraception shortage
[3:09:18.100 --> 3:09:20.100]  in the UK has apparently
[3:09:20.100 --> 3:09:22.100]  caused chaos
[3:09:22.100 --> 3:09:24.100]  for women wanting to have promiscuous
[3:09:24.100 --> 3:09:26.100]  unprotected sex
[3:09:26.100 --> 3:09:28.100]  how's mad
[3:09:28.100 --> 3:09:30.100]  no not the heck in pilarino
[3:09:30.100 --> 3:09:32.100]  you don't understand I need to have promiscuous sex
[3:09:32.100 --> 3:09:34.100]  consequence free
[3:09:34.100 --> 3:09:36.100]  no
[3:09:36.100 --> 3:09:38.100]  the degenerate hellscape of modern
[3:09:38.100 --> 3:09:40.100]  hypergamous relationships that has contributed
[3:09:40.100 --> 3:09:42.100]  to record high levels of depression
[3:09:42.100 --> 3:09:44.100]  and suicide
[3:09:44.100 --> 3:09:46.100]  in young people
[3:09:46.100 --> 3:09:48.100]  that's fine
[3:09:48.100 --> 3:09:50.100]  wanting to embrace
[3:09:50.100 --> 3:09:52.100]  traditional gender roles and become a
[3:09:52.100 --> 3:09:54.100]  trad wife
[3:09:54.100 --> 3:09:56.100]  that's a form of extremism
[3:09:56.100 --> 3:09:58.100]  according to the institute of strategic dialogue
[3:09:58.100 --> 3:10:00.100]  a think tank that partners with national governments
[3:10:00.100 --> 3:10:02.100]  google and others to quote
[3:10:02.100 --> 3:10:04.100]  counter hate and extremism in the UK
[3:10:04.100 --> 3:10:06.100]  women who choose to be subservient
[3:10:06.100 --> 3:10:08.100]  to men in the framework of a traditional
[3:10:08.100 --> 3:10:10.100]  marriage
[3:10:10.100 --> 3:10:12.100]  or comparable to the brides of ISIS terrorists
[3:10:12.100 --> 3:10:14.100]  this is where we're at
[3:10:18.100 --> 3:10:20.100]  meanwhile
[3:10:20.100 --> 3:10:22.100]  UK TV host philip schofield was
[3:10:22.100 --> 3:10:24.100]  universally celebrated after announcing
[3:10:24.100 --> 3:10:26.100]  that he was gay
[3:10:26.100 --> 3:10:28.100]  fantastic stunning and brave
[3:10:28.100 --> 3:10:30.100]  just a shame he can
[3:10:30.100 --> 3:10:32.100]  have been stunning and brave a little earlier
[3:10:32.100 --> 3:10:34.100]  instead of lying about it to his wife and kids for 27 years
[3:10:34.100 --> 3:10:36.100]  I think I've speak on behalf of all of us
[3:10:36.100 --> 3:10:42.100]  when I say that we've got nothing but love and respect for you
[3:11:06.100 --> 3:11:08.100]  sky news devoted
[3:11:08.100 --> 3:11:10.100]  three of their top four
[3:11:10.100 --> 3:11:12.100]  headlines to schofield's announcement
[3:11:12.100 --> 3:11:14.100]  the Daily Mail offered a running commentary
[3:11:14.100 --> 3:11:16.100]  on schofield's every movement
[3:11:16.100 --> 3:11:18.100]  reporting the monumental news
[3:11:18.100 --> 3:11:20.100]  that he had arrived home
[3:11:20.100 --> 3:11:22.100]  the stampede of enthusiasm was so vehement
[3:11:22.100 --> 3:11:24.100]  that Buckingham Palace was forced to deny
[3:11:24.100 --> 3:11:26.100]  rumours that the queen had abdicated
[3:11:26.100 --> 3:11:28.100]  her throne and that schofield had been
[3:11:28.100 --> 3:11:30.100]  proclaimed gay
[3:11:30.100 --> 3:11:32.100]  and that schofield had been
[3:11:32.100 --> 3:11:36.100]  lured for ending his 27 year marriage
[3:11:36.100 --> 3:11:38.100]  over in Australia a mother of four
[3:11:38.100 --> 3:11:40.100]  was being publicly shamed on national television
[3:11:40.100 --> 3:11:42.100]  for making her husband breakfast
[3:11:42.100 --> 3:11:44.100]  I want to take you back to the 1950s
[3:11:44.100 --> 3:11:46.100]  Brookesmith shared her routine online
[3:11:46.100 --> 3:11:48.100]  here's what she said
[3:11:48.100 --> 3:11:50.100]  I always make sure I don't go to bed until
[3:11:50.100 --> 3:11:52.100]  everyone's lunches are packed
[3:11:52.100 --> 3:11:54.100]  their clothes are set out for the next day
[3:11:54.100 --> 3:11:56.100]  including my husband's clothes
[3:11:56.100 --> 3:11:58.100]  I always make sure I don't go to bed
[3:11:58.100 --> 3:12:00.100]  until everyone's lunches are packed
[3:12:00.100 --> 3:12:02.100]  their clothes are set out for the next day
[3:12:02.100 --> 3:12:04.100]  including my husband's and the house is clean
[3:12:04.100 --> 3:12:06.100]  dishwasher is on and a load of washing is on
[3:12:06.100 --> 3:12:08.100]  I always get up early 4.30
[3:12:08.100 --> 3:12:10.100]  with my husband to make his breakfast
[3:12:10.100 --> 3:12:12.100]  and coffee
[3:12:12.100 --> 3:12:14.100]  um
[3:12:14.100 --> 3:12:16.100]  go brooke
[3:12:16.100 --> 3:12:18.100]  whatever
[3:12:18.100 --> 3:12:20.100]  taking care of your spouse and children
[3:12:20.100 --> 3:12:22.100]  within the context of a fulfilling monogamous marriage
[3:12:22.100 --> 3:12:24.100]  the sheer temerity
[3:12:24.100 --> 3:12:26.100]  has he hypnotised her or something
[3:12:26.100 --> 3:12:28.100]  who does this stuff
[3:12:28.100 --> 3:12:30.100]  making his breakfast
[3:12:30.100 --> 3:12:32.100]  and then putting his clothes out of a night
[3:12:32.100 --> 3:12:34.100]  who does this stuff
[3:12:34.100 --> 3:12:36.100]  apparently only ISIS terrorists
[3:12:36.100 --> 3:12:38.100]  brides and tradwife extremists
[3:12:38.100 --> 3:12:40.100]  my only theory is that she might actually like her husband
[3:12:40.100 --> 3:12:42.100]  alright Shemai Mbagan
[3:12:42.100 --> 3:12:44.100]  meanwhile back in London
[3:12:44.100 --> 3:12:46.100]  Sadiq Khan revealed the winner of the award
[3:12:46.100 --> 3:12:48.100]  for diversity in advertising
[3:12:48.100 --> 3:12:50.100]  an advert that was so diverse
[3:12:50.100 --> 3:12:52.100]  it featured zero white people
[3:12:52.100 --> 3:12:54.100]  celebrating different body types and skin tones
[3:12:54.100 --> 3:12:56.100]  which are underrepresented in advertising
[3:12:56.100 --> 3:12:58.100]  except body types like this
[3:12:58.100 --> 3:13:00.100]  which are underrepresented
[3:13:00.100 --> 3:13:02.100]  because you banned them
[3:13:02.100 --> 3:13:04.100]  strange how the only advertisement
[3:13:04.100 --> 3:13:06.100]  seen in London that lacks diversity
[3:13:06.100 --> 3:13:08.100]  is the one telling white people
[3:13:08.100 --> 3:13:10.100]  to sterilise themselves
[3:13:12.100 --> 3:13:14.100]  Paul brother
[3:13:14.100 --> 3:13:16.100]  it is time
[3:13:16.100 --> 3:13:18.100]  you must call out the eggless ones again
[3:13:18.100 --> 3:13:20.100]  they are ruining our birth rates
[3:13:20.100 --> 3:13:22.100]  the sexual revolution
[3:13:22.100 --> 3:13:24.100]  and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race
[3:13:24.100 --> 3:13:26.100]  I am the eggman
[3:13:26.100 --> 3:13:28.100]  I like this boy
[3:13:28.100 --> 3:13:30.100]  I like someone else
[3:13:30.100 --> 3:13:32.100]  I am the eggman
[3:13:32.100 --> 3:13:34.100]  I am the eggman
[3:13:34.100 --> 3:13:36.100]  I am the eggman
[3:13:36.100 --> 3:13:38.100]  I am the one who knows
[3:13:38.100 --> 3:13:40.100]  who could do what I am
[3:13:40.100 --> 3:13:42.100]  I am the one who knows
[3:13:42.100 --> 3:13:44.100]  who could do what I am
[3:13:44.100 --> 3:13:46.100]  I am the one who knows
[3:13:46.100 --> 3:13:48.100]  in entertainment news
[3:13:48.100 --> 3:13:50.100]  I'm excited to see rage against the machine's comeback gig
[3:13:50.100 --> 3:13:52.100]  at the Capital One arena
[3:13:52.100 --> 3:13:54.100]  the 11th biggest financial institution
[3:13:54.100 --> 3:13:56.100]  in America
[3:13:56.100 --> 3:13:58.100]  that helped pioneer the mass marketing
[3:13:58.100 --> 3:14:00.100]  of credit cards in the early 90s
[3:14:00.100 --> 3:14:02.100]  enslaving an entire generation
[3:14:02.100 --> 3:14:04.100]  with mountains of consumer debt
[3:14:04.100 --> 3:14:06.100]  fight the power when the avant-garde
[3:14:06.100 --> 3:14:08.100]  becomes the guard
[3:14:08.100 --> 3:14:10.100]  fringe against the machine
[3:14:10.100 --> 3:14:12.100]  woke actress Jamila Jamil was criticised
[3:14:12.100 --> 3:14:14.100]  for being cast in an LGBT
[3:14:14.100 --> 3:14:16.100]  interest TV show
[3:14:16.100 --> 3:14:18.100]  when she's straight
[3:14:18.100 --> 3:14:20.100]  Jamila's response
[3:14:20.100 --> 3:14:22.100]  was a checkmate bigots
[3:14:22.100 --> 3:14:24.100]  I mean she's been in a relationship for the past 5 years
[3:14:24.100 --> 3:14:26.100]  with musician James Blake
[3:14:26.100 --> 3:14:28.100]  who last time I checked was a man
[3:14:28.100 --> 3:14:30.100]  and before him she had a long term relationship
[3:14:30.100 --> 3:14:32.100]  with another man she described as her first love
[3:14:32.100 --> 3:14:34.100]  but yeah you're queer now Jamila
[3:14:34.100 --> 3:14:36.100]  okay
[3:14:38.100 --> 3:14:40.100]  next time someone calls me an Islamophobe
[3:14:40.100 --> 3:14:42.100]  I'll just instantly convert to Islam
[3:14:44.100 --> 3:14:46.100]  a Filipino climate activist wrote an article
[3:14:46.100 --> 3:14:48.100]  for vice saying she left the environmental
[3:14:48.100 --> 3:14:50.100]  movement because it was too white
[3:14:50.100 --> 3:14:52.100]  the climate movement is overwhelmingly white
[3:14:52.100 --> 3:14:54.100]  so I walked away
[3:14:54.100 --> 3:14:56.100]  the authors of the Emancipation Proclamation
[3:14:56.100 --> 3:14:58.100]  are overwhelmingly white
[3:14:58.100 --> 3:15:00.100]  so I continue my life as a slave
[3:15:00.100 --> 3:15:02.100]  those awful white people in there
[3:15:02.100 --> 3:15:04.100]  spins wheel
[3:15:04.100 --> 3:15:06.100]  trying to save the planet
[3:15:06.100 --> 3:15:08.100]  according to CNN there are also too many white people

[3:15:10.100 --> 3:15:12.100]  go Riley what has been helpful
[3:15:12.100 --> 3:15:14.100]  to you
[3:15:14.100 --> 3:15:16.100]  in combating racism
[3:15:16.100 --> 3:15:18.100]  I think it's helpful
[3:15:18.100 --> 3:15:20.100]  and important to talk to other white people
[3:15:20.100 --> 3:15:22.100]  about racism
[3:15:22.100 --> 3:15:24.100]  and I think a lot of people
[3:15:24.100 --> 3:15:26.100]  they don't want to be racist
[3:15:26.100 --> 3:15:28.100]  they don't think that they're racist
[3:15:28.100 --> 3:15:30.100]  but they also
[3:15:30.100 --> 3:15:32.100]  don't know some of the things that they
[3:15:32.100 --> 3:15:34.100]  believe or say
[3:15:34.100 --> 3:15:36.100]  are and can be racist
[3:15:36.100 --> 3:15:38.100]  there's just too many white people in here
[3:15:38.100 --> 3:15:40.100]  because it does make some of us POCs
[3:15:40.100 --> 3:15:42.100]  uncomfortable when we see

[3:18:16.020 --> 3:18:21.220]  hurting these scumbags the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side
[3:18:21.220 --> 3:18:26.260]  and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to
[3:18:26.260 --> 3:18:32.500]  suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep

[3:18:40.100 --> 3:18:46.660]  the fact that we are awake they fear the fact that we are alive they fear the fact that we

[3:18:54.180 --> 3:18:58.180]  about the real deal here and i and i love trump all day long but man i tell you he sits here and
[3:18:58.180 --> 3:19:02.660]  lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over and everybody i'm i mean i've got a problem
[3:19:03.220 --> 3:19:07.460]  and we'll just take the trump rallies over that said about two months ago i came with a plan that
[3:19:07.460 --> 3:19:12.980]  i haven't launched yet we have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers 20 different
[3:19:12.980 --> 3:19:18.980]  stickers impeach the democrats save the second amendment defend the first amendment info wars.com
[3:19:18.980 --> 3:19:22.740]  and it looks like duct tape but it's just a regular sticker you put it over your mouth you go to a
[3:19:22.740 --> 3:19:27.060]  trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting things people say why are you doing
[3:19:27.060 --> 3:19:31.700]  this what's happening when you go well we're being censored you know trump won't do anything about it
[3:19:31.700 --> 3:19:35.220]  and dr pacinic i'm let me just ask you what you think because i've not launched this yet it's
[3:19:35.220 --> 3:19:41.460]  brilliant you've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and
[3:19:41.460 --> 3:19:47.620]  made it into a weapon you have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most disturbing
[3:19:47.620 --> 3:19:57.780]  to people silence silence silence you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:06.180 --> 3:20:13.220]  live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:20:13.220 --> 3:20:19.300]  news we are live and i'm going to try this again we've got a headline up on summit dot news
[3:20:19.300 --> 3:20:25.940]  uk hospitals to deny care to racist or homophobic patients of course over the past two years we've
[3:20:25.940 --> 3:20:32.580]  had this massive wave of deplatforming from social media websites from mail servers from
[3:20:32.580 --> 3:20:39.700]  payment processors even in some cases from banks and financial institutions well now
[3:20:39.700 --> 3:20:44.020]  in new rules set to take effect in april and i actually wrote about this a couple of months
[3:20:44.020 --> 3:20:49.620]  ago when it was first being proposed now it's going into practice by the way under a conservative
[3:20:49.620 --> 3:20:55.540]  government this is taking place patients deemed to be racist or homophobic will be denied care
[3:20:55.540 --> 3:21:01.780]  in nhs trust hospitals under these new rules it says currently staff can refuse to treat
[3:21:01.780 --> 3:21:06.980]  non-critical patients who are verbally aggressive or physically violent towards them well now they're
[3:21:06.980 --> 3:21:12.580]  going to include and extend that to harassment bullying or discrimination including homophobic
[3:21:12.580 --> 3:21:20.100]  sexist or racist remarks of course the problem being just on the face of it that's ridiculous but
[3:21:20.100 --> 3:21:26.260]  the problem being older people getting treatment don't know what racism is in 2020 i'll give you
[3:21:26.260 --> 3:21:33.940]  an example in the uk older people still use the term colored people of course it's woke to say
[3:21:33.940 --> 3:21:39.540]  people of color that's acceptable a lot of older people over the age of 50 60 70
[3:21:40.420 --> 3:21:46.340]  use the term colored people that's not politically correct that's deemed racist in today's modern
[3:21:46.340 --> 3:21:51.540]  parlance of politically correct speech codes what is the line on what's going to be determined to
[3:21:51.540 --> 3:21:58.100]  be racist or homophobic and what is the line on what's going to be determined determined to be
[3:21:58.100 --> 3:22:04.580]  critical and non-critical care there you see somebody on twitter joked about it this is going
[3:22:04.580 --> 3:22:08.900]  to be a hilarious when a boomer is denied his double bypass because he called someone colored
[3:22:08.900 --> 3:22:16.420]  on facebook and there's other examples of this as jack montgomery highlights in late 2017 an nhs
[3:22:16.420 --> 3:22:21.940]  patient who requested a female nurse to carry out a cervical smear complained that when the hospital
[3:22:21.940 --> 3:22:29.220]  sent a person with an obviously male appearance close crop tear male facial appearance and voice
[3:22:29.220 --> 3:22:35.620]  large number of tattoos and facial stubble who insisted my gender is not male i'm a transsexual
[3:22:35.620 --> 3:22:41.220]  so our people who are going to ask questions about being treated for female procedures
[3:22:41.780 --> 3:22:48.180]  by an obviously biological male are they going to be called transphobic are they going to be
[3:22:48.180 --> 3:22:53.300]  denied care as i write in the article this is even worse than china's social credit score
[3:22:53.300 --> 3:22:59.300]  which hasn't yet gone so far as to punish people by withdrawing medical treatment if they engage in
[3:22:59.300 --> 3:23:05.860]  wrong think now you can be denied plane and train tickets if you criticize the government as far as
[3:23:05.860 --> 3:23:12.500]  i know no one's being denied actual hospital treatment for expressing wrong think so again
[3:23:12.500 --> 3:23:20.260]  this is the tip toe to absolute unbridled totalitarianism it went from social media websites
[3:23:20.260 --> 3:23:27.540]  it went from diplomatic platforming people from bank accounts mortgages now basic hospital treatment
[3:23:28.180 --> 3:23:34.100]  and of course what is critical non-critical care if you're an elderly patient with health
[3:23:34.100 --> 3:23:40.660]  problems it can go from non-critical to critical very quickly somebody else posted on twitter
[3:23:40.660 --> 3:23:48.260]  don't get sick in the uk if you've ever posted grooming gang statistics that's exactly it what is
[3:23:48.260 --> 3:23:54.340]  the barometer of what will be considered racist maybe you've got a social credit score history
[3:23:54.340 --> 3:23:59.060]  i'm talking about five ten years into the future that has deemed you to be racist
[3:23:59.060 --> 3:24:04.820]  and deemed you unsuitable for hospital care under these new rules and again this is all
[3:24:04.820 --> 3:24:12.020]  being introduced under a conservative government in the united kingdom people asked if this was a
[3:24:12.020 --> 3:24:18.660]  real story yes it's a real story this is going to take effect in april and of course is it going
[3:24:18.660 --> 3:24:24.900]  to work the other way on non-white people who make racist statements are they going to be
[3:24:24.900 --> 3:24:30.820]  done denied hospital treatment or is this this all going to be applied in one direction i wonder
[3:24:30.820 --> 3:24:36.980]  in a related story breitbart reports judge rules against police that acted like checker
[3:24:36.980 --> 3:24:45.380]  gestapo stasi over online transgender jokes this was a guy called harry miller who has won his
[3:24:45.380 --> 3:24:49.780]  high court freedom of speech battle against homicide police over his right to make jokes about
[3:24:49.780 --> 3:24:57.780]  transgenderism on social media now as far as i remember he didn't even tweet this he merely
[3:24:57.780 --> 3:25:05.220]  liked a tweet which was a limerick making fun of transgender people thus miller himself an ex
[3:25:05.220 --> 3:25:11.620]  copper was in sense when humberside police sent a police officer around his home bearing in mind
[3:25:11.620 --> 3:25:16.340]  we got record violent crime across the entire united kingdom but this guy likes a tweet about
[3:25:16.340 --> 3:25:22.900]  transgenderism a limerick enough police resources to send a police officer around to his home
[3:25:22.900 --> 3:25:28.100]  in order to quote check his thinking that was the term they use literal thought police
[3:25:28.660 --> 3:25:33.060]  after remarks he had made on twitter we've classified as a non-crime hate incident
[3:25:35.300 --> 3:25:40.180]  now the judge has responded to this he said the claimants tweets we were lawful and there
[3:25:40.180 --> 3:25:44.980]  was not the slightest risk he would commit a criminal offense by continuing to tweet i found
[3:25:44.980 --> 3:25:49.620]  the common combination of the police visiting the claimants place of work and their subsequent
[3:25:49.620 --> 3:25:54.500]  statements in relation to the possibility of prosecution were disproportionate interference
[3:25:54.500 --> 3:26:02.100]  with the claimants right to freedom of expression bearing in mind that this guy's employer at the
[3:26:02.100 --> 3:26:07.780]  time that this was in the news or before it was even in the headlines was given a call by the police
[3:26:07.780 --> 3:26:15.220]  and asked if any transgender people were working in his place of work because they might feel unsafe
[3:26:15.220 --> 3:26:21.700]  because he liked a limerick on twitter the judge continued in his statement
[3:26:23.380 --> 3:26:28.100]  in this country we've never had a checker a gestapo or a starzate we have never lived in an
[3:26:28.100 --> 3:26:33.540]  Orwellian society well they're literally arresting mothers in their own kitchens with their babies
[3:26:33.540 --> 3:26:38.660]  next to them for saying that biological men are men on twitter so i would argue that that's
[3:26:38.660 --> 3:26:44.660]  somewhat Orwellian beyond anything Orwell could ever imagine however the court ruling is unlikely
[3:26:44.660 --> 3:26:49.540]  to resolve much because the judge did not accept miller's wider challenge against the college of
[3:26:49.540 --> 3:26:56.900]  policing guidelines on hate crime these define a hate incident as any non-crime incident which is
[3:26:56.900 --> 3:27:03.700]  perceived perceived by the victim or any other person to be motivated by hostility or prejudice
[3:27:03.700 --> 3:27:08.820]  against a person who is transgender or perceived to be transgender so they investigate it if the
[3:27:08.820 --> 3:27:15.380]  victim perceives it to be a hate incident not based on any impartial objective evidence or
[3:27:15.380 --> 3:27:20.980]  eyewitness statements whatsoever if the victim perceives it to be a hate incident then it's
[3:27:20.980 --> 3:27:28.020]  logged and investigated as one and of course you've seen the behavior of people like jessica
[3:27:28.020 --> 3:27:34.420]  yeneve over in canada of course people who claim victimhood status and wrap it in themselves
[3:27:34.420 --> 3:27:39.620]  as a form of identity as a very mean means of existence of course they're going to claim that
[3:27:39.620 --> 3:27:45.060]  anything that offends them is a hate incident please get called out not like we have record
[3:27:45.060 --> 3:27:51.140]  stabbings across the country article continues clearly if one of the plans of the borris johnson
[3:27:51.140 --> 3:27:56.020]  dominant Cummings pretty to tell law and order faction in the new administration is to recoup
[3:27:56.020 --> 3:28:01.860]  restore common sense to the english justice system much work still needs to be done to strip out the
[3:28:01.860 --> 3:28:06.580]  entrenched political greatness introduced during the black years not only are they not stripping
[3:28:06.580 --> 3:28:13.060]  it out they're advancing it they've literally just passed rules that say if you're perceived again
[3:28:13.060 --> 3:28:18.740]  it's all about perception to have made a racist statement while you're visiting hospital then
[3:28:18.740 --> 3:28:24.020]  you can be not denied hospital treatment so they've done nothing to roll it back and everything to
[3:28:24.020 --> 3:28:31.780]  entrench it even more and yet they still have the temerity to call themselves the conservative party
[3:28:31.780 --> 3:28:37.140]  gonna come back in the next segment talk about new stats out of paris which reveal that nearly
[3:28:37.140 --> 3:28:43.220]  half of all criminals in some areas of paris have a migrant background we're also going to get into

[3:31:53.060 --> 3:32:00.900]  world war two adolf hitler had discredited the eugenics and world population control organizations
[3:32:00.900 --> 3:32:07.300]  they openly had meetings and led by julian huxley all this huxley's brother decided to repackage
[3:32:07.300 --> 3:32:15.540]  themselves as transhumanist now in the year 2020 to set the precedent that people can be turned into
[3:32:15.540 --> 3:32:22.180]  cyborgs uh that robots can be given rights you name it they are intimidating and arresting people
[3:32:22.180 --> 3:32:29.860]  all over the world who simply misgender someone so the ultimate crime will be even asking what
[3:32:29.860 --> 3:32:37.380]  someone is if you can't even tell what they are this is the ultimate cough to ask mind control
[3:32:37.380 --> 3:32:43.140]  and there's several big articles up on info wars dot com that break this down uk teen finder house
[3:32:43.140 --> 3:32:49.380]  arrest for asking trans police officers gender uk mother spare jail for misgendering trans woman

[3:33:00.900 --> 3:33:13.780]  broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the united kingdom
[3:33:13.780 --> 3:33:22.660]  it's paul joseph watson and we are back and we have a headline up here on national file dot com
[3:33:22.660 --> 3:33:29.540]  reads tp usa's cringe beam guy once made video comparing trump to musselini in fact i tweeted
[3:33:29.540 --> 3:33:36.900]  something in relation to this earlier about the maga types the maga types of 2020 there's
[3:33:36.900 --> 3:33:41.780]  gotta love how the maga movement is completely comprised of everyone who hated trump in 2016
[3:33:41.780 --> 3:33:47.300]  while everyone that loved him has been locked out and publicly shamed now of course there were many
[3:33:47.300 --> 3:33:53.220]  of us who were somewhat reluctant to jump on board the trump train back in early 2016 until we
[3:33:53.220 --> 3:33:59.380]  figured out you know that it was a real america first movement a lot of people who eventually
[3:33:59.380 --> 3:34:06.260]  longed on to that movement have a very distinct history of despising in some cases trashing
[3:34:06.260 --> 3:34:12.260]  president trump and this is one of them by the way if you don't know there has been a huge war
[3:34:12.260 --> 3:34:18.260]  between what is termed conservative ink what is termed the groy per movement in terms of trying
[3:34:18.260 --> 3:34:24.900]  to push conservative ink towards embracing truly conservative principles that has been a big turf
[3:34:24.900 --> 3:34:32.820]  war over the past three or four months tpu sa and they have assisted organization in the uk called
[3:34:32.820 --> 3:34:38.100]  tpu k and again all the people in the organization many of the people at the top of that organization
[3:34:38.100 --> 3:34:43.620]  are not bad people some of them are my friends some of them later got out of that whole movement
[3:34:43.620 --> 3:34:51.700]  and but again they're so paranoid about optics that in the case of tpu k right at the beginning
[3:34:51.700 --> 3:34:58.420]  of it and this came out a couple of days ago on a twitter account called grifter watch they had a
[3:34:58.420 --> 3:35:04.660]  list of people right at the start of this movement in the uk the uk version of it back i think it
[3:35:04.660 --> 3:35:12.740]  was uh 2018 early 2019 who they could not associate with guess who was on that list well yours truly
[3:35:12.740 --> 3:35:19.780]  sorghum of akkad other what would be described as centrist youtubers and in fact at the very start
[3:35:19.780 --> 3:35:28.100]  tpu k wanted to disassociate themselves with nigel forage that's how nervous they were about
[3:35:28.100 --> 3:35:34.820]  being smeared by the media by the left as two right wing of course nigel forage has probably been
[3:35:34.820 --> 3:35:42.180]  the most instrumental politician in the uk for decades and decades so that illustrates how nervous
[3:35:42.180 --> 3:35:46.980]  they were right at the start i don't really care if they want to disassociate from me i wasn't
[3:35:46.980 --> 3:35:52.180]  associated with them in any official capacity anyway but the fact that they were scared of
[3:35:52.180 --> 3:35:57.620]  being affiliated with nigel forage probably tells you everything tpu sa has some of the
[3:35:57.620 --> 3:36:03.460]  same problems we've had people like nick fuentes on the show to discuss that well now it's emerged
[3:36:04.180 --> 3:36:11.860]  that tpu sa is cringe meme guy benny johnson by the way this is a guy who gives interviews
[3:36:11.860 --> 3:36:17.860]  where he says we need to connect young people to politics because they're disconnected to politics
[3:36:17.860 --> 3:36:25.380]  because they find it so opaque so boring so the way to do it is to hook them in by combining the
[3:36:25.380 --> 3:36:31.780]  politics with the memes by reaching young people with the memes the problem is you have to use
[3:36:31.780 --> 3:36:39.460]  memes that aren't dated and only recognized and understood by 50 60 year old boomers now don't
[3:36:39.460 --> 3:36:46.260]  get me wrong we love our boomers but there's literally a video of this guy and others for
[3:36:46.260 --> 3:36:53.220]  example at the tpu sa event in florida i think it was december last year where he gets up on
[3:36:53.220 --> 3:36:58.980]  stage but before he gets up on stage they play a video intro where he's saying that the left
[3:36:58.980 --> 3:37:04.820]  can't meme and he's literally stood in front of this graphics projection of a bunch of memes
[3:37:04.820 --> 3:37:12.020]  from 2016 like it's probably time to update the memes at this point they post memes on
[3:37:12.020 --> 3:37:18.820]  their instagram page of the ridler from a movie that's literally like 50 years old and will not
[3:37:18.820 --> 3:37:26.180]  be recognized or understood by anyone under the age of 40 or 50 so if you're going to connect
[3:37:26.180 --> 3:37:32.500]  with the young people via memes probably time to update the memes that a lot of these people have
[3:37:32.500 --> 3:37:39.460]  been caught as being grifters because back in 2016 they were firmly against president trump
[3:37:39.460 --> 3:37:45.780]  only later jumped on the bandwagon mainly to create careers for themselves in the UK we've
[3:37:45.780 --> 3:37:51.460]  had people jump on the conservative party bandwagon again pretending to be pro brexit pretending to
[3:37:51.460 --> 3:37:57.540]  be true conservatives when in fact they're just grifting because they want to embed and ingratiate
[3:37:57.540 --> 3:38:04.340]  themselves into social circles and into conservative ink into the conservative party establishment
[3:38:04.340 --> 3:38:12.180]  but if you go back on their tweets and even not that far back in some cases their true ideals
[3:38:12.180 --> 3:38:18.980]  are and their true alignments are well known and in fact very concerning indeed now a 2016 video
[3:38:18.980 --> 3:38:25.060]  might made by turning point USA's chief creative officer comparing president Donald Trump to Italian
[3:38:25.060 --> 3:38:32.340]  fascist dictator Benito Mussolini has resurfaced on the internet and this was posted earlier today
[3:38:33.540 --> 3:38:37.300]  four years later after his sudden departure from the daily call after his ethics were
[3:38:37.300 --> 3:38:43.780]  calling to question benny johnson works for the allegedly pro trump tp usa and then it talks about
[3:38:43.780 --> 3:38:51.460]  the gripe wars but then it talks about this meme where he's literally on his own facebook page in
[3:38:51.460 --> 3:38:59.700]  2016 comparing Donald Trump to Benito Mussolini and this is one of the head guys now at tp usa
[3:39:00.420 --> 3:39:07.140]  apparently via the medium of memes trying to get Donald Trump reelected now beliefs can change
[3:39:07.140 --> 3:39:12.820]  ideals can change the tactics certainly haven't changed and if you're using memes from 2016 if
[3:39:12.820 --> 3:39:18.340]  you're using memes from 50 year old movies about the riddler not really going to connect with young
[3:39:18.340 --> 3:39:25.460]  people jade and mcneill tweeted benny went from attacking trump to conservative ink gatekeeper
[3:39:25.460 --> 3:39:31.380]  remind me who are the real conservative again now it's interesting because they will use the same
[3:39:31.940 --> 3:39:40.260]  rhetoric the same language that they used against trump in 2016 they'll use that same rhetoric those
[3:39:40.260 --> 3:39:48.180]  same smear tactics those same false denunciations against people in this america first movement
[3:39:48.180 --> 3:39:54.740]  in 2020 despite the fact that all those people in the america first movement were actually behind
[3:39:54.740 --> 3:40:01.460]  the great meme war of 2016 now they're being thrown under a bus by conservative ink who if you go back
[3:40:01.460 --> 3:40:08.180]  to their own facebook profiles back in 2016 were trying to throw president trump under the bus
[3:40:08.180 --> 3:40:13.460]  using some of the very same rhetoric that they're using now against people that they deem to be
[3:40:13.460 --> 3:40:21.540]  to right wing so again how paranoid do you need to be at this point when an organization like tpu k
[3:40:21.540 --> 3:40:29.300]  was scared of embracing nigel forage into their political movement not in 2016 not in 2015 but
[3:40:29.300 --> 3:40:37.860]  in 2019 and of course he later went on to be a spokesman for that tpu k movement but not before
[3:40:37.860 --> 3:40:43.380]  they were concerned about associating with him so you know really makes you think really makes you
[3:40:43.380 --> 3:40:49.700]  think in terms of what's going on with the coronavirus we had two deaths in iran that
[3:40:49.700 --> 3:40:54.900]  were announced early today we've also got this headline from zero hedge shocking video shows
[3:40:54.900 --> 3:41:01.780]  quarantine violators being heard at inter-reeducation camp because last week i highlighted a video where
[3:41:01.780 --> 3:41:09.140]  the detainees at the quarantine camp were being forced to perform dance maneuvers nothing more
[3:41:09.140 --> 3:41:14.100]  or welly than that we now got a video in this zero hedge article which shows them being paraded
[3:41:14.100 --> 3:41:21.300]  around some kind of medical facility and they're being asked to shout quingshan stay strong which
[3:41:21.300 --> 3:41:27.460]  is obviously the area they're from but they're being forced to sing loyalty songs to their local
[3:41:27.460 --> 3:41:33.140]  government their local area as they're being herded into a detainment camp meanwhile wuhan
[3:41:33.140 --> 3:41:40.100]  mother speaks out no beds no medicine all lies and again this comes back to the central question of
[3:41:41.140 --> 3:41:47.220]  china lying about the severity and the source of the outbreak we had a major report out of the
[3:41:47.220 --> 3:41:53.780]  prestigious trusted university in china a few days ago saying that the source of the coronavirus
[3:41:53.780 --> 3:42:01.780]  was this biosafety for a biological lab that situated 200 and one of their facilities was
[3:42:01.780 --> 3:42:09.780]  situated 280 meters from that meat market which we were told was the alleged source of the coronavirus
[3:42:09.780 --> 3:42:15.780]  outbreak this prestigious university study conducted by biological biological scientists
[3:42:15.780 --> 3:42:22.740]  found that it was actually the bio lab facility situated 280 meters away so a lot of people in
[3:42:22.740 --> 3:42:27.460]  china are still trying to get this truth out trying to claim that the severity of the outbreak is
[3:42:27.460 --> 3:42:32.500]  way worse than they're being told by the chinese communist party meanwhile as i'll get into after
[3:42:32.500 --> 3:42:39.860]  the break the who and social media companies continue to crack down on quote misinformation
[3:42:39.860 --> 3:42:46.020]  about the coronavirus again solidly trusting whatever the communist party out of china
[3:42:46.020 --> 3:42:53.780]  is telling them don't go away summit dot news we'll be back across the western world from
[3:42:53.780 --> 3:43:01.700]  high school to college sports to even the olympics men biological men are winning almost all of the
[3:43:01.700 --> 3:43:09.380]  sporting events this is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away
[3:43:09.380 --> 3:43:14.580]  all in the name of the liberalism and openness and then every day i have stacks of news articles
[3:43:14.580 --> 3:43:21.220]  just like today uk team find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it
[3:43:21.220 --> 3:43:27.460]  hurt their feelings uk mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay
[3:43:27.460 --> 3:43:35.380]  thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty that's the thought
[3:43:35.380 --> 3:43:41.220]  police if a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason you get fined and you go to jail
[3:43:41.220 --> 3:43:46.980]  this is tyranny these people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific
[3:43:46.980 --> 3:43:52.820]  anti-human takeover resist it speak out against it there can no longer be any doubt
[3:43:53.780 --> 3:44:00.980]  this coronavirus is serious on multiple levels it's very communicable it spreads very very fast
[3:44:00.980 --> 3:44:06.100]  it is killing a lot of people and the chinese communist government has covered up just how
[3:44:06.100 --> 3:44:11.540]  bad it is and the white house is now openly challenging them show our trump's top scientist

[3:48:41.540 --> 3:48:46.260]  headline on senate.news new stats reveal nearly half of all criminals in paris ghettos have
[3:48:46.260 --> 3:48:53.540]  migrant background because the very existence of no-go zone ghettos was denied and debunked as a
[3:48:53.540 --> 3:48:58.980]  conspiracy theory by much of the media for several years at the height of the refugee crisis
[3:48:59.540 --> 3:49:05.380]  well now according to newly released statistics in some areas of paris almost 50 percent of criminals
[3:49:05.380 --> 3:49:12.180]  have a migrant background this is out of french newspaper of figaro mainstream newspaper which
[3:49:12.180 --> 3:49:17.620]  reports that in certain departments the number of foreign-born criminals is as high as 47.6
[3:49:17.620 --> 3:49:23.300]  percent these figures are from the national observatory of delinquency in criminal responses
[3:49:23.300 --> 3:49:30.020]  revealed that crimes carried out by unaccompanied youth increased by 22.7 percent this is from
[3:49:30.020 --> 3:49:38.820]  2016 to 2019 right after that wave of migrants poured into cities like paris and you notice
[3:49:38.820 --> 3:49:44.900]  the difference believe me you noticed in fact i remember going to paris in 2015 and going back
[3:49:44.900 --> 3:49:51.460]  in late 2016 and the difference was very noticeable for example pickpocketing offences committed by
[3:49:51.460 --> 3:49:59.540]  younger migrants have risen from 80 15.8 percent in 2016 to 31.7 percent in 2019 so you're talking
[3:49:59.540 --> 3:50:06.820]  about basically doubled burglaries in paris carried out by young migrants rose from 2.1 percent in
[3:50:06.820 --> 3:50:13.780]  2016 to 13.1 percent in 2019 that's a massive spike while foreign youth involvement in violent
[3:50:13.780 --> 3:50:22.500]  robberies also searched from 4.8 percent in 2016 to 16.6 percent in 2019 of course france like the
[3:50:22.500 --> 3:50:28.740]  uk has a massive problem with knife attacks and violent crime in general in general and the stats
[3:50:28.740 --> 3:50:35.060]  also revealed that 120 knife attacks occur in france on an average day with 44 000 victims of
[3:50:35.060 --> 3:50:42.660]  knife crime being reported every single year so france continues to enjoy its cultural enrichment
[3:50:42.660 --> 3:50:50.980]  and meanwhile a new study or a survey to be more accurate it's an online survey finds people who
[3:50:50.980 --> 3:50:56.260]  identify as left-wing more likely to have been diagnosed with a mental illness the data speaks
[3:50:56.260 --> 3:51:03.060]  for itself this was a survey carried out by slate star codex an online survey website which collected
[3:51:03.060 --> 3:51:08.340]  a wealth of data from people and i looked at the questions there were probably like 200 questions
[3:51:08.340 --> 3:51:15.620]  in this survey asked them to identify their educational demographic lifestyle and political
[3:51:15.620 --> 3:51:22.580]  views and then asked them if they've been formally diagnosed with depression borderline personality
[3:51:22.580 --> 3:51:29.460]  disorder bipolar disorder or schizophrenia and it found that people who occupy the left-wing
[3:51:29.460 --> 3:51:36.420]  political positions the more extreme the more correlation tend to have more likely to have
[3:51:36.420 --> 3:51:42.020]  been formally diagnosed with depression borderline personality disorder bipolar disorder or schizophrenia
[3:51:42.580 --> 3:51:49.300]  this is a trend that i noticed years ago with people on twitter especially people in the uk
[3:51:50.020 --> 3:51:57.220]  who would viciously attack me for my tweets and my videos it was stunning how when i
[3:51:57.220 --> 3:52:02.260]  researched the history the background of these people they all had massive problems
[3:52:02.260 --> 3:52:07.460]  with depression and mental illness now god forbid i'm not saying that mental illness and
[3:52:07.460 --> 3:52:13.300]  depression isn't a big deal with opioid abuse at record levels across america of course it is
[3:52:13.300 --> 3:52:19.780]  but in every single case i noticed that these people had massive problems with self-loathing
[3:52:19.780 --> 3:52:25.300]  and there seems to be a correlation between people who have problems with self-loathing
[3:52:25.300 --> 3:52:33.060]  and people who identify as left-wing try and figure out what causes that correlation the
[3:52:33.060 --> 3:52:38.340]  results show that the highest percentage of respondents 38 percent who admit being diagnosed
[3:52:38.340 --> 3:52:44.420]  with forms of mental illness also identify politically as marxists in comparison just 12.1
[3:52:44.420 --> 3:52:49.700]  percent of conservatives say they're being diagnosed with a mental disorder and as i state in the
[3:52:49.700 --> 3:52:56.340]  article while the survey is by no means scientific it does give an insight into how disturbed people
[3:52:56.900 --> 3:53:03.140]  are more likely to be attracted to fringe leftist beliefs which in a lifestyle sense and by the way
[3:53:03.140 --> 3:53:09.540]  these people were asked to map out their lifestyles their behavior usually encourage degeneracy and a
[3:53:09.540 --> 3:53:17.220]  lack of moral responsibility so no doubt that self-loathing people tend to more identify with
[3:53:17.220 --> 3:53:23.940]  left-wing beliefs that give them a free pass to jettison any sense of moral responsibility
[3:53:24.500 --> 3:53:28.740]  and of course live their lives claiming that they're depressed that it's an outside force
[3:53:28.740 --> 3:53:35.620]  causing them to behave in certain ways that's why they're attracted to left-wing beliefs it was a
[3:53:35.620 --> 3:53:43.780]  survey of 8 000 people it was by no means a small pool in that survey meanwhile after failing with
[3:53:43.780 --> 3:53:52.260]  worm burgers norwegian grocery chain to launch cricket burgers the first trial failed now they're
[3:53:52.260 --> 3:53:56.580]  going to go back and say well people didn't want to eat worms maybe they'll want to eat crickets and
[3:53:56.580 --> 3:54:02.980]  who knows i mean as i sign this article there was a mexican restaurant in soho new york city
[3:54:03.540 --> 3:54:08.980]  where the cricket burgers were apparently a surprise hit in the words of the new york post
[3:54:08.980 --> 3:54:15.380]  of course we know why they're promoting eating bugs and eating worms because
[3:54:16.420 --> 3:54:21.380]  our standard of living is going to be dramatically reduced if they get in these global warming
[3:54:21.380 --> 3:54:28.260]  green new deal programs if they successfully demonize the meat industries the milk industries
[3:54:28.260 --> 3:54:36.500]  and forces all over to this high protein and also trendy diet of eating things like meal worms and
[3:54:36.500 --> 3:54:43.060]  bugs well now in norway supermarket many this is the supermarket chain in norway
[3:54:43.860 --> 3:54:49.700]  scrap the idea of worm burgers after insufficient demand imagine that but seem convinced they can
[3:54:49.700 --> 3:54:56.260]  stir up enthusiasm for people to chomp down on insects horn hein who's the communications
[3:54:56.260 --> 3:55:02.340]  manager of this company told at news website e24 quote it is difficult to see whether norwegian
[3:55:02.340 --> 3:55:07.220]  consumers are more open to insects in a burger than bread but the link to testing alternative
[3:55:07.220 --> 3:55:13.860]  protein sources such as insects is probably more closely linked to a burger and the crickets contain
[3:55:13.860 --> 3:55:21.700]  60% protein it's very easy to create the burgers they just grind grind grind down the crickets
[3:55:21.700 --> 3:55:28.660]  and mix them with flour make them into a bug patty and serve it to their consumers they made
[3:55:28.660 --> 3:55:34.420]  some of the staff for this many corporation test the cricket burgers and apparently they were very
[3:55:34.420 --> 3:55:41.220]  appetizing the respondents to the article didn't seem so enthusiastic one of them said there's no
[3:55:41.220 --> 3:55:47.380]  chance in hell i would eat this another one said no boycott is needed because there won't even be
[3:55:47.380 --> 3:55:53.940]  any sale so according to the respondents to the to the article not so keen on the cricket burger
[3:55:53.940 --> 3:55:59.060]  but they're going to try and trial it in that growth grocery supermarket chain we'll see
[3:55:59.060 --> 3:56:05.620]  what the result is good luck good luck meanwhile berkeley tells students not to post racist
[3:56:05.620 --> 3:56:12.260]  coronavirus means this is out of the university of california berkeley is telling students not
[3:56:12.260 --> 3:56:18.900]  supposed means about the coronavirus asserting that fear of the epidemic is rooted in racism it's
[3:56:18.900 --> 3:56:25.540]  not rooted in the fact that 70 000 people based on the chinese communist party's official numbers
[3:56:25.540 --> 3:56:31.380]  which is probably way underestimating it or straight up lying about it it's not based on that
[3:56:31.380 --> 3:56:36.260]  it's not based on the fact that 2000 people have already died from the coronavirus no according
[3:56:36.260 --> 3:56:42.340]  to berkeley academics fears about the coronavirus are based on quote an assumption that the west
[3:56:42.340 --> 3:56:49.380]  particularly anglo-american christians should dominate the world so if you don't want to catch
[3:56:49.380 --> 3:56:56.260]  the coronavirus basically you're a white supremacist and the biggest problem with all this as the
[3:56:56.260 --> 3:57:04.580]  who itself has suggested in now two separate press releases is not the spread the potential
[3:57:04.580 --> 3:57:11.860]  global pandemic nature of the coronavirus it's social media memes and gifts now berkeley is
[3:57:11.860 --> 3:57:19.540]  telling students if they post social media memes and gifts that will only provoke more racism so
[3:57:19.540 --> 3:57:25.300]  again spread of coronavirus protecting yourself washing your hands preventing a global pandemic
[3:57:26.180 --> 3:57:31.940]  that might be somewhat important what is more important is not offending somebody and hurting
[3:57:31.940 --> 3:57:38.100]  their feelings with those dastardly fat soup memes that's going to wrap it up for the show war room
[3:57:38.100 --> 3:57:44.340]  is coming up next breaking news at summit dot news
