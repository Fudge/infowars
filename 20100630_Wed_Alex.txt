[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:32.680]  I tell you this broadcast is a war zone my friends I cannot believe how hard core
[00:32.680 --> 00:38.760]  the news is getting how it's intensifying every day it is Wednesday the 30th
[00:38.760 --> 00:49.200]  day of June 2010 and we're going to be live here for the next four hours let me
[00:49.200 --> 00:53.400]  just run through the headlines here dollar should be replaced by
[00:53.400 --> 00:59.800]  international standard a UN report says CNN this right after the G20 met of
[00:59.800 --> 01:04.360]  course we've been telling you for years about the SDR global government
[01:04.360 --> 01:12.520]  currency issued by private banks here it is in full admitted no more doubts also
[01:12.520 --> 01:17.800]  Bloomberg reports banks financing Mexico gangs admitted in Wells Fargo deal
[01:17.800 --> 01:22.480]  all the big major Federal Reserve member banks are been caught laundering
[01:22.480 --> 01:26.760]  billions of dollars of narcotics money well of course they run the narcotics
[01:26.760 --> 01:32.360]  operations that is Bloomberg and that's why all the King's horses and all the
[01:32.360 --> 01:36.520]  King's men work around the clock to keep drugs illegal to keep the price up on
[01:36.520 --> 01:40.480]  their main product and their excuse to hunt us and put us in their private
[01:40.480 --> 01:45.720]  prisons wake up to that fact they are the drug dealers Hurricane Alex turns
[01:45.720 --> 01:50.880]  towards Mexico Texas Coast as you know yesterday Rick Perry declared an
[01:50.880 --> 01:56.680]  emergency in South Texas it has become a hurricane and it is blowing the oil
[01:56.680 --> 02:01.960]  directly at Louisiana Mississippi and Florida it is coming up from the Southwest
[02:01.960 --> 02:07.400]  turning up towards the east and set to slam in and make landfall right at the
[02:07.400 --> 02:15.760]  Texas Mexico border really bad news continuing Obama has now made noises
[02:15.760 --> 02:21.000]  today in Reuters that they are going to look at allowing international aid 70
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.840]  plus days and but at first the lawyers have to decide so he's now putting into
[02:24.840 --> 02:32.520]  a process into a no man's land into a into a type of purgatory where oh yes
[02:32.520 --> 02:36.960]  I guess we'll accept foreign aid and all these ships but but we've got to let
[02:36.960 --> 02:40.440]  the bureaucrats decide who can come and when and they've got to do all our paper
[02:40.440 --> 02:43.720]  work and we have to develop a system for that first so that'll no doubt take a
[02:43.720 --> 02:47.840]  few months and once that's already you know been too late because the
[02:47.840 --> 02:53.040]  hurricanes will be driving the oil into the United States BP is controlling
[02:53.040 --> 02:57.880]  access to medical care for Gulf oil cleanup workers that's being reported
[02:57.880 --> 03:03.480]  all part of the massive takeover and a cover-up of just how deadly this is
[03:03.480 --> 03:06.680]  that's why they won't let the workers were respirators because then they have
[03:06.680 --> 03:09.920]  to admit that the air is deadly in these areas where they're engaged in the
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.000]  cleanups of the toxic sludge just like on 9-11 for a week they told emergency
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.120]  workers don't wear a mask you don't need it because they would have said wear
[03:18.120 --> 03:21.840]  mask then they would have to admit that the air was dirty and they couldn't have
[03:21.840 --> 03:26.600]  reopened Wall Street or the schools and other businesses and so they told the
[03:26.600 --> 03:31.400]  cops and the firemen and everybody else don't wear a mask the air is clean and
[03:31.400 --> 03:36.080]  even though there was several feet of deadly toxic asbestos and shattered glass
[03:36.080 --> 03:42.120]  dust on the ground the people said well I'm not a conspiracy theorist to question
[03:42.120 --> 03:45.640]  anything as a conspiracy theorist I must do whatever the media and the
[03:45.640 --> 03:49.160]  government tells me so we're not gonna wear mask and of course lots of them
[03:49.160 --> 03:53.160]  are dead now it's the same thing here but you do not question the media do you
[03:53.160 --> 03:58.200]  do not question BP BP says that this crude oil doesn't have any toxins coming
[03:58.200 --> 04:02.320]  off of it and I've got clips of Obama saying there's not any toxic problems
[04:02.320 --> 04:07.640]  and it's safe for workers you don't need any respirators and so later good luck
[04:07.640 --> 04:10.680]  getting any health care when you're dying in fact I've got even CBS news
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.000]  reports whether people are going in who don't smoke who are emergency workers
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.200]  they're being told you've got the lungs of a three pack a day person who's been
[04:18.200 --> 04:23.720]  smoking for 30 years your lungs are fried and that's working in that toxic
[04:23.720 --> 04:27.960]  oil and more important the dispersant that's four to six times depending on
[04:27.960 --> 04:32.840]  which variant they're using as toxic is the most toxic crude oil and they've
[04:32.840 --> 04:39.760]  sprayed 200 plus thousand gallons just in the first 60 days and we're 70 something
[04:39.760 --> 04:43.160]  in now I tried to look for the statistics and didn't find it 200 plus
[04:43.160 --> 04:49.640]  thousand gallons of that sprayed out there oh excuse me here's the article
[04:49.640 --> 04:53.520]  I'm sorry barrels barrels and like I said the big Taiwan oil skimmer can do
[04:53.520 --> 04:58.000]  50,000 barrels I'm sorry it's 500,000 barrels a day but Obama is blocking that
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.160]  skimmer stay with us let me tell you a little bit about one of our great

[08:19.640 --> 08:30.320]  Alex Jones
[08:30.320 --> 08:34.480]  let me start back into these headlines here for you
[08:37.640 --> 08:42.840]  dollar should be replaced as international standard UN report says
[08:42.840 --> 08:49.620]  that's CNN banks financing Mexico gangs admitted in Wells Fargo deal America's
[08:49.620 --> 08:55.240]  biggest banks are treacherous outside corporate interest they are enemy
[08:55.240 --> 09:01.560]  spy organizations they are society wrecking financial takeover artist
[09:01.560 --> 09:07.400]  Hurricane Alex turns towards Mexico and Texas Coast here's another one by the
[09:07.400 --> 09:10.800]  way we have Congressman Ron Paul joining us tomorrow to talk about this and a
[09:10.800 --> 09:15.760]  lot of other important issues like the oil spill the impending war with Iran
[09:15.760 --> 09:19.840]  what's happening with the economy now this is directly from Ron Paul's office
[09:19.840 --> 09:26.720]  it's going up on info wars.com right now and it's from Congressman Ron Paul
[09:26.720 --> 09:34.440]  going up on info wars.com right now they are attacking us they say because
[09:34.440 --> 09:39.000]  they're having an effect the Federal Elections Commission has launched a pair
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.640]  of investigations on campaign for liberty which have always been extreme
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.040]  sticklers in following the Byzantine federal law they've created a political
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.800]  action committee and they go out and find candidates that believe in the
[09:54.800 --> 09:59.120]  Constitution Bill of Rights and so they will be gone after because they're
[09:59.120 --> 10:03.920]  becoming effective just like the system is trying to now shut down the free
[10:03.920 --> 10:10.080]  internet as we know it so that is coming up a little bit later in this hour as
[10:10.080 --> 10:17.760]  well third U.S. carrier 4,000 Marines augment U.S. Armada opposite Iran that's
[10:17.760 --> 10:21.920]  out of Debka file but I was able to pull it up in mainstream Israeli papers as
[10:21.920 --> 10:25.680]  well they're also moving a troop carriers that can launch helicopter and
[10:25.680 --> 10:31.600]  ground force assaults you know into Iran and they're looking now to pass even
[10:31.600 --> 10:38.000]  more sanctions to start boarding their ships and expanded act of war on that
[10:38.000 --> 10:46.360]  front continuing no extra powers granted to police during G20 summit that's the
[10:46.360 --> 10:50.960]  Toronto Star the police just lied and said they didn't need to process they
[10:50.960 --> 10:56.640]  could now arrest anyone they wanted for no reason and that they could not allow
[10:56.640 --> 11:01.880]  filming and that they could arrest basically anyone for any reason and
[11:01.880 --> 11:07.080]  of course it was a complete lie and this is the dream of police now worldwide
[11:07.080 --> 11:11.960]  is to be God you become an officer you become someone literally above Christ
[11:11.960 --> 11:20.640]  himself you become you know above all above Zeus you are just God and I saw a
[11:20.640 --> 11:25.960]  video interview on democracy now the London Guardian inner reporter who was
[11:25.960 --> 11:29.160]  simply there covering it and they arrested a bunch of the mainstream media
[11:29.160 --> 11:37.320]  and we're letting them go and they saw his guardian pass and they had no reason
[11:37.320 --> 11:41.920]  to be arresting activists everybody was peaceful at that rally he said and he
[11:41.920 --> 11:44.600]  said well I'm with the Guardian and they said well we're not accepting this
[11:44.600 --> 11:49.840]  this credential and the police said stand him up and they stood him up and
[11:49.840 --> 11:52.800]  started punching him in the stomach Billy clubbed him in the back of the head
[11:52.800 --> 11:58.640]  continued to beat him up and make fun of him and say that'll teach you that'll
[11:58.640 --> 12:05.120]  teach you reporter and it's just you take people who couldn't get a job at
[12:05.120 --> 12:11.040]  anything else you take people who couldn't pump gas you take people who
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.360]  would lose their job at McDonald's and you give them a badge and a gun and then
[12:15.360 --> 12:18.760]  you militarize them you know military is meant to kill people and break things
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.160]  and military is meant to be silent and deadly and to be honed professional
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.520]  killers that you use to defend your nation but now they've militarized the
[12:27.520 --> 12:32.440]  police they have hired deranged veterans who serve two three four five
[12:32.440 --> 12:38.400]  tours and they teach him to give the American people no quarter and the same
[12:38.400 --> 12:44.280]  thing in Canada the same thing in England we are descending the entire
[12:44.280 --> 12:49.800]  Western culture I mean I'm looking at photos and videos and I was just
[12:49.800 --> 12:53.600]  reminded by about one of them on screen at prisonplanet.com up there in the
[12:53.600 --> 12:58.280]  rotating tiles of a little ten-year-old boy being choked by police and riot
[12:58.280 --> 13:02.600]  gear and he's crying with terror on his face and the police have looks of
[13:02.600 --> 13:07.360]  enjoyment this is the type of people that we finance and that we've given
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.520]  unlimited power over us who just enjoy beating the hell out of people and we're
[13:12.520 --> 13:18.680]  only about one inch away from living like they do in Cairo where there was a
[13:18.680 --> 13:23.560]  blogger who'd been exposing police beating people and so they went and
[13:23.560 --> 13:28.480]  found out where he was at a internet cafe and they marched him outside and the
[13:28.480 --> 13:33.200]  newspapers reported that witnesses said it took them 20 minutes of bashing his
[13:33.200 --> 13:38.040]  head into a metal railing to kill him until his brains came out I mean they
[13:38.040 --> 13:43.600]  were just gonna beat his head until his brains came out you don't show us
[13:43.600 --> 13:47.600]  killing or hurting people or we will come get you as a member of the press and
[13:47.600 --> 13:55.800]  we will beat your brains out that's how they are in Iran it's how they are in
[13:55.800 --> 14:00.520]  Russia in the past that's how they were in East Germany and that's how we're
[14:00.520 --> 14:04.520]  becoming here today and I know a lot of police are not evil are not thugs are
[14:04.520 --> 14:09.640]  not sadist but they're promoting the sadist and in press report after press
[14:09.640 --> 14:17.560]  report where media got beat up including mainstream cbc TV reporters ct
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.000]  v national news reporters with their big professional cameras in their media
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.880]  outfits the police were so mad dog crazy they would attack them as well just
[14:28.880 --> 14:37.760]  peaceful crowds just attack them on video and the reporters in report after
[14:37.760 --> 14:41.320]  report describe cops will walk up and say this is a smart mouth mouth
[14:41.320 --> 14:47.560]  reporter yeah they think they're gonna push us around show them and so one
[14:47.560 --> 14:53.960]  group of cops would chant things like that and the other cops would then rush
[14:53.960 --> 14:57.400]  forward knocking them down with their shields and then beating them on the
[14:57.400 --> 15:03.000]  ground laughing and growling and it's kind of like if you've got a chihuahua
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.880]  or a little dog and it's fun sometimes to train him to get you know who is it
[15:06.880 --> 15:12.520]  who is at the door get him get him get him and the dog will hang on halfway
[15:12.520 --> 15:16.520]  playing with the end will start scratching with its back legs like a
[15:16.520 --> 15:23.920]  bull strutting and it's a joke but but now this is the boiled down lowest
[15:23.920 --> 15:29.920]  common denominator mob psychology or the cops are like get him yeah let's get
[15:29.920 --> 15:35.000]  him that's and each person then escalates the next one and I've seen cops
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.240]  admit this well we did shotgun that girl when the Red Sox one she came out of a
[15:39.240 --> 15:42.640]  bar and we shot her at one foot away with rubber bullets and blew her head off
[15:42.640 --> 15:46.320]  bullets went into her brain the rubber bullets and the cops from the news saying
[15:46.320 --> 15:50.640]  no one's gonna be charged because it was just adrenaline yeah she's some 21 year
[15:50.640 --> 15:54.280]  old journalism student with no criminal record who walked out of a bar because
[15:54.280 --> 15:59.680]  the Red Sox had won and the cops showed up and just shot her in the face it's
[15:59.680 --> 16:04.640]  weird cops seem to go crazy on nonviolent passive people but when he
[16:04.640 --> 16:08.680]  legal aliens are burning cars and tumping vehicles over in Los Angeles the
[16:08.680 --> 16:13.480]  cops back off or when guys who are dressed up and look like cops wearing
[16:13.480 --> 16:17.360]  Nike outfits we've caught them in that same area in Ottawa just a few miles
[16:17.360 --> 16:22.520]  away from Toronto week I mean it's CBC admits the police admit yes we attacked
[16:22.520 --> 16:27.480]  her own officers yes we staged events to try to you so so they've been caught
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.480]  and and I've watched the video those aren't meth head kind of mainline
[16:32.480 --> 16:37.880]  college communists that call themselves anarchist because I guess communism
[16:37.880 --> 16:41.320]  supposedly out so you've got to be covert about it now these are not your
[16:41.320 --> 16:46.760]  occasional meth head with a scraggly beard these were cops I mean I could take
[16:46.760 --> 16:51.080]  one look at them or they were military special forces and the cops stood back
[16:51.080 --> 16:55.160]  and let them burn the cars I mean that's your can you imagine if somebody else
[16:55.160 --> 16:59.960]  tried to burn a car the cops would shoot you and they should set in a car on fire
[16:59.960 --> 17:08.800]  is a very dangerous act that can kill people but no if an average blood bag
[17:08.800 --> 17:12.280]  and that's what the American people are the Canadian people are if a vampire saw
[17:12.280 --> 17:20.680]  a blood bag a blood bottle a meal a prey animal lighting fire instinctively prey
[17:20.680 --> 17:24.000]  animals have got to be kept in line if you let one of those ants stand up
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.440]  they'll all stand up it's not about food it's about control to use the line from
[17:29.440 --> 17:35.160]  a bug's life with the grasshoppers again of a blood bag actually set fire to a
[17:35.160 --> 17:40.800]  vehicle they would probably gun them down but when a imperial stormtrooper
[17:40.800 --> 17:46.360]  does it you know we're made to believe that it's the sand people but only
[17:46.360 --> 17:50.720]  imperial stormtroopers are so precise you never heard of Sam people hitting
[17:50.720 --> 17:57.200]  something this big and use a popular culture false flag type fiction example
[17:57.200 --> 18:03.280]  for you and we know that the imperial stormtroopers the real amount of police
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.960]  in Canada have been caught from coast to coast staging events hell I had them
[18:07.960 --> 18:11.800]  running around in plain clothes obviously cops you take a one look at them
[18:11.800 --> 18:17.120]  and you know going let's do something violent Alex let's you know let's and
[18:17.120 --> 18:20.080]  I'd say come on man I know you're a cop and they'd say the notice that my
[18:20.080 --> 18:22.960]  camera would know they'd say well what are you planning it was just like they
[18:22.960 --> 18:26.080]  were even admitting there were cops I'm gonna come on leave me alone you guys
[18:26.080 --> 18:32.800]  already had your fun with me at the at the airplane border when I landed and so
[18:32.800 --> 18:36.480]  I mean do you really want to live in a country where your guy set fires the
[18:36.480 --> 18:40.960]  things and where you attack other cops you attack city cops in Toronto or you
[18:40.960 --> 18:45.120]  attack city cops in Ottawa or Montabello so you can have your pretext to go
[18:45.120 --> 18:48.600]  after everybody and I haven't even gotten to some of our top stories yet I'm
[18:48.600 --> 18:56.960]  already digressing down a rabbit trail when we come back activist arrested on
[18:56.960 --> 19:03.920]  bogus charge to cover for illegal conduct of Toronto police Charlie Veach
[19:03.920 --> 19:08.520]  trying on an airplane yesterday and we get the text message they've got me
[19:08.520 --> 19:14.840]  Charlie said get help so we had the info wars.com article out on that and
[19:14.840 --> 19:17.640]  then later we learned he had been taken to the police department and charged and
[19:17.640 --> 19:22.800]  we have major newspapers here with the headlines let me just read you one of
[19:22.800 --> 19:29.880]  the headlines here that that they have in the newspapers and radio stations
[19:29.880 --> 19:36.600]  about man arrested for impersonating police and because he called himself the
[19:36.600 --> 19:42.240]  love police and on one video began joking saying oh you know I could even
[19:42.240 --> 19:47.920]  be an undercover cop like you guys have out here staging riots and so they're
[19:47.920 --> 19:52.960]  saying that and the term love police means he was I guess staying of the
[19:52.960 --> 19:56.640]  police needs to be arrested and so they're now holding a British citizen

[24:27.160 --> 24:32.920]  the shoreline of the United States we'll also get into the incredible
[24:32.920 --> 24:38.800]  developments with the G20 openly announcing the global conversion away
[24:38.800 --> 24:45.760]  from the dollar to a new private SDR now I know for our listeners that is very
[24:45.760 --> 24:51.080]  old news but now it's becoming official and we need to discuss ways to stop this
[24:51.080 --> 24:57.640]  A&B what it's going to mean if they're able to complete this conversion you
[24:57.640 --> 25:01.840]  think the economy is bad now you think these bankers that have destroyed our
[25:01.840 --> 25:06.160]  society and bought off our police and committed all these crimes you think
[25:06.160 --> 25:12.440]  it's bad now we ain't seen nothing yet as they say now this next news is so
[25:12.440 --> 25:16.560]  incredible I really want to put an exclamation point psychologically behind
[25:16.560 --> 25:20.200]  this in amongst all the other incredible news that we're covering but
[25:20.200 --> 25:27.640]  authoritarian oppression is marching and going wild and basically blitzkrieging
[25:27.640 --> 25:34.080]  on every front in an attempt to just overwhelm free societies everywhere
[25:34.080 --> 25:38.680]  classically tyrannical nations are becoming more oppressive but once
[25:38.680 --> 25:45.440]  free nations are not going slowly but are now just fully imploding and
[25:45.440 --> 25:51.960]  collapsing into hard-core oppression night has fallen in Canada night is
[25:51.960 --> 25:56.360]  falling in the United States night has fallen in England the police have by
[25:56.360 --> 26:01.400]  every yardstick and measurement been turned into classical tyrants we see
[26:01.400 --> 26:07.400]  Supreme Court nominees and justices voting for total gun control for attacks
[26:07.400 --> 26:11.240]  on free speech for federal takeover of the internet we see the same thing
[26:11.240 --> 26:16.840]  happening in Europe they are moving against us they are now persecuting
[26:16.840 --> 26:22.080]  Ron Paul and Ron Paul says this is a political attack they know that campaign
[26:22.080 --> 26:25.800]  for liberty candidates are winning primaries nationwide this they know
[26:25.800 --> 26:31.000]  this is a real restoration through our voting system and they are going to try
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.160]  to start wars emergency oil spills domestic terror attacks you name it
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.920]  they've tried to set up the Hattari militia to demonize patriots they are
[26:41.920 --> 26:47.280]  moving against us this is a violent revolution by criminal offshore banks
[26:47.280 --> 26:51.800]  and I'm going to tie that in with the Russian spies coming up in the next
[26:51.800 --> 26:58.280]  segment of course there's Russian spies in this country but what about the banks
[26:58.280 --> 27:02.360]  what about global corporations they are the big threat what about the Chinese
[27:02.360 --> 27:06.640]  what about Israeli spies I mean they've infiltrated every level of this
[27:06.640 --> 27:10.720]  government that's admitted running much of u.s. foreign policy no one even
[27:10.720 --> 27:18.080]  debates that Israel brags about it Netanyahu brags the former prime minister
[27:18.080 --> 27:24.440]  Ariel Sharon bragged in Jerusalem posts and herettes about it I mean America is
[27:24.440 --> 27:30.240]  a whorehouse for anybody that wants to come here and sell this country out so
[27:30.240 --> 27:33.920]  why are they going after the Russians now because as bad as the Russian
[27:33.920 --> 27:37.480]  government is and all the corruption they've got they're not part of the new
[27:37.480 --> 27:41.040]  world order as far as I can research and tell they've said they want their own
[27:41.040 --> 27:46.480]  new world order the Chinese are a big part of it and that's why they can have
[27:46.480 --> 27:50.720]  3,000 plus front companies and growing that's why they can have Chinese generals
[27:50.720 --> 27:54.240]  in the winehouse and in the commerce department that's why they can have
[27:54.240 --> 27:59.520]  everything that's why the US sells its weapons systems to Israel and Israel
[27:59.520 --> 28:05.280]  openly gives it to China but you get some Russian infiltrators that's a classic
[28:05.280 --> 28:09.120]  form of course there's spies I've seen people in spinning it in the Russian
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.720]  media they were reporters anybody who comes here illegally anybody that has
[28:14.720 --> 28:19.760]  fake husband and wife teams trouncing around yeah those are spies folks and
[28:19.760 --> 28:24.920]  if you don't think the United States has got spies all over Russia deep cover
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.120]  husband and wife teams you got nothing coming and if you don't think the
[28:29.120 --> 28:32.080]  Israelis have got teams over here everywhere else you got nothing coming
[28:32.080 --> 28:38.120]  the Israelis admit their ratio of humant human intelligence spies is the
[28:38.120 --> 28:43.000]  biggest in the world comparatively to their population there are spies all
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.200]  over the place but let me tell you what's even more important corporate spies
[28:46.200 --> 28:51.400]  they openly come in and buy your politicians in plain view they openly
[28:51.400 --> 28:56.520]  go and write the laws 94% of the laws aren't even read in Congress you know
[28:56.520 --> 29:00.680]  where the espionage is going on it's the Federal Reserve they had a financial
[29:00.680 --> 29:07.160]  coup d'etat in 1913 they would have already passed it this week if Robert
[29:07.160 --> 29:10.960]  Byrd hadn't died he was the one vote they needed that's a godsend for us to stop
[29:10.960 --> 29:19.200]  this situation that 92 year old monster is gone off to be with his father we
[29:19.200 --> 29:26.720]  know his father is the father of lies they are of their father the devil all
[29:26.720 --> 29:30.160]  right yeah that's what I mean it's just insane I'm gonna cover that in a tail
[29:30.160 --> 29:33.040]  that was just a mini rant on the subject but I'm gonna break down the
[29:33.040 --> 29:38.080]  Russian spy situation what do you think Goldman Sachs is I mean Supreme Court
[29:38.080 --> 29:42.120]  Justice Kagan Goldman Sachs all the major federal regulatory positions over
[29:42.120 --> 29:45.600]  money Goldman Sachs that's the same in all the other countries they're robbing
[29:45.600 --> 29:55.200]  line these are enemy spies we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:55.200 --> 30:02.200]  and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[30:02.200 --> 30:06.640]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[30:06.640 --> 30:10.640]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[30:10.640 --> 30:14.560]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[30:14.560 --> 30:18.560]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:18.560 --> 30:23.120]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[30:23.120 --> 30:27.120]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:27.120 --> 30:30.920]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[30:30.920 --> 30:34.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[30:34.560 --> 30:38.920]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[30:38.920 --> 30:42.080]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[34:32.000 --> 34:34.920]  model but the corporates use it it's not the British just they developed the
[34:34.920 --> 34:39.080]  model on record Carol Quigley the list goes on and on of top political
[34:39.080 --> 34:43.200]  professors scientists who were part of it writing textbooks on it 900 pages
[34:43.200 --> 34:46.960]  long any of you can understand how the world really works so I want to throw
[34:46.960 --> 34:51.800]  the gauntlet down the police military FBI everyone who serves the system this
[34:51.800 --> 34:57.640]  isn't your government anymore this isn't America anymore it isn't Canada or
[34:57.640 --> 35:03.680]  England anymore this isn't Kansas anymore you're not in Kansas anymore it's a
[35:03.680 --> 35:08.520]  very simple statement but it's true we are not in Kansas anymore you have got
[35:08.520 --> 35:12.680]  to get that through your head I told you a decade ago they would have a global
[35:12.680 --> 35:19.360]  cashless currency that all currencies are based on in subunits I did not look
[35:19.360 --> 35:24.480]  into a magic crystal ball I did not go to Greece and climb the hill and talk to
[35:24.480 --> 35:31.400]  the Delphi Oracle Nostradamus didn't tell me I read trilateral Commission and
[35:31.400 --> 35:39.240]  CFR white papers that were public they are public about what they are doing to
[35:39.240 --> 35:47.640]  us it is not a conspiracy theory and here it is seeing it in today dollar
[35:47.640 --> 35:51.920]  should be replaced as international standard you and report says two days
[35:51.920 --> 35:56.160]  after the G 20 closed down its meeting they have been ironing this out the
[35:56.160 --> 36:05.000]  last two years they're officially doing it they are officially doing it there
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.360]  were several plans in the past to do this several different plans in the
[36:11.360 --> 36:15.440]  70s they said they'd have three global currencies that have currency instability
[36:15.440 --> 36:18.920]  between the three currencies and that they would then go to the one global
[36:18.920 --> 36:22.160]  cashless currency and you could still have local currencies but they'd be
[36:22.160 --> 36:28.760]  denominated and backed and controlled by the central private banking system and
[36:28.760 --> 36:32.640]  that is now what they're doing but they're just bypassing ever launching
[36:32.640 --> 36:39.680]  the Asian currency and they're going directly to the SDR you know I need to
[36:39.680 --> 36:44.520]  just walk through each one of these pieces of information there's Iran there's
[36:44.520 --> 36:56.480]  the oil spill there's the police state there is the monetary situation and I'm
[36:56.480 --> 37:01.480]  just going to go over it all very slowly here and why should I have to shoot
[37:01.480 --> 37:07.120]  special YouTube videos of what I'm about to say because I've noticed if I do it
[37:07.120 --> 37:13.440]  on the radio show or it's just cut up pieces at prisonplanet.tv of the live
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.120]  simulcast we do every day that it doesn't get the same impact if I go out in a
[37:18.120 --> 37:25.200]  hallway and have somebody with a webcam shoot a video of me talking about
[37:25.200 --> 37:28.040]  something the same thing I see on the radio it might end up getting a million
[37:28.040 --> 37:34.560]  views but when I say it here on the radio it's heard by maybe a million
[37:34.560 --> 37:38.840]  people at the time and then later a few hundred thousand more and that's it and
[37:38.840 --> 37:42.760]  if we posted on YouTube maybe ten thousand people but if I go and do it
[37:42.760 --> 37:45.920]  outside the studio people recognize oh this is something different different
[37:45.920 --> 37:49.440]  background and they pay attention to it and I and I realize more and more
[37:49.440 --> 37:54.200]  everything that's happening is profound everything that's going on is
[37:54.200 --> 37:58.480]  incredible I can't sleep I got up at 3 30 this morning went to bed at about
[37:58.480 --> 38:06.080]  midnight I am troubled in my spirit I am troubled in my psyche I am troubled in
[38:06.080 --> 38:11.000]  my intellectual outlook can't you feel it don't you know the world's about to
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.800]  get a hundred times crazier you think all the wild bizarreness that's happened
[38:15.800 --> 38:25.520]  is anything compared to what's coming all right let me just let me just pause
[38:25.520 --> 38:30.760]  for a moment and collect myself and then I'm gonna I'm gonna try to as as as
[38:30.760 --> 38:34.240]  focused as I can go through this
[38:34.240 --> 38:46.960]  let me start here with what's happened at the G20 slash G8 in Canada there have
[38:46.960 --> 38:49.880]  been unbelievable new developments and I'm gonna cover those but first I want
[38:49.880 --> 38:55.120]  to set the foundation of what's happened in the last four or five days at a cost
[38:55.120 --> 39:01.160]  of now over 1.2 billion it was half a billion then 800 million then 900
[39:01.160 --> 39:05.160]  million then a billion then a billion to now they're saying it's gonna be over a
[39:05.160 --> 39:13.480]  billion to and lawsuits are also gonna cost tens of millions so we're talking
[39:13.480 --> 39:18.800]  over 1 billion at 200 million that is very close to the yearly budget of
[39:18.800 --> 39:25.680]  Toronto that's bigger than the budget of the city of Austin Texas for three
[39:25.680 --> 39:32.720]  official days and then several days of aftermath for the security for the heads
[39:32.720 --> 39:38.000]  of the private central banks the G20 that control the Treasury departments of
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.280]  our nations and these meetings are public and private they have public
[39:43.280 --> 39:47.240]  versions and then secret versions and they criminals openly get together and
[39:47.240 --> 39:52.480]  cut deals we've had four year request in Canada and the US with the North
[39:52.480 --> 39:58.240]  American Union SPP G20 meetings and we cover this in my film in-game at these
[39:58.240 --> 40:02.480]  meetings they talk about hey we've got to get carbon taxes to fund our new
[40:02.480 --> 40:07.000]  global SDR we're gonna set up a world government run by private banks we're
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.400]  gonna take over the water supplies the food supplies we're gonna do this to
[40:10.400 --> 40:14.760]  destroy industrialized society and make huge profits for ourselves the
[40:14.760 --> 40:19.280]  corporate chiefs at the meetings tell the government officials what to do I
[40:19.280 --> 40:24.600]  mean this is the real Congress the the the world government criminal Congress
[40:24.600 --> 40:28.800]  and that's why when the true global government Congress or parliament you
[40:28.800 --> 40:32.640]  can call it whatever you want the mafia Commission comes to your city Pittsburgh
[40:32.640 --> 40:37.280]  or your city Toronto or your city of London they kill people remember the
[40:37.280 --> 40:42.680]  newspaper delivery person had the special little passes and everything cops
[40:42.680 --> 40:48.880]  walk up and say you can't go in that convenience store by the bank he said
[40:48.880 --> 40:54.400]  okay well I'm just delivering newspapers but okay he turned around cop didn't
[40:54.400 --> 40:58.360]  like it wasn't enough that he submitted so they murdered him they beat him to
[40:58.360 --> 41:02.280]  death the good news is in England they've charged the cops with manslaughter
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.920]  at least because there's we are in Soviet Russia we are in Nazi Germany we
[41:06.920 --> 41:11.800]  are in Pol Potts Cambodia if they don't charge him and most the time they
[41:11.800 --> 41:15.200]  cover it up but the point is the police tried to lie they tried to have a fake
[41:15.200 --> 41:19.280]  coroner's inquest then videos got released to the police seized them and
[41:19.280 --> 41:23.240]  other police then said I'm not gonna lie they murdered him and they just beating
[41:23.240 --> 41:29.280]  to death for fun I am a human being and so is Charlie Veatch but I'm gonna get
[41:29.280 --> 41:35.240]  to his arrest in a moment and so you have two days there's no violence and
[41:35.240 --> 41:40.880]  then clearly military types or police types and the pull the all the roll
[41:40.880 --> 41:45.680]  amount of police have been caught attacking their own officers in Ottawa
[41:45.680 --> 41:51.320]  two and a half years ago that's national news so to say that they look like cops
[41:51.320 --> 41:57.680]  and act like cops in the riot police stand down as the people burn a police
[41:57.680 --> 42:02.640]  car wearing Nike apparel no anarchist wherever we're Nike that's number one
[42:02.640 --> 42:08.240]  group they protest I mean it's totally fake the real rat-like anarchist that
[42:08.240 --> 42:12.520]  I've seen at these events that are real are drugged out of their minds their
[42:12.520 --> 42:18.280]  trust fund kids and they're all got communist tattoos that they they're
[42:18.280 --> 42:23.480]  walking contradiction they're communist anarchist or or leftist anarchist I've
[42:23.480 --> 42:33.600]  seen that term no such thing okay that's like saying you are a I don't know
[42:33.600 --> 42:38.480]  it's just it's it's it's like saying the Sun is the moon it's like saying water is
[42:38.480 --> 42:43.600]  fire it's like saying dirt is air I mean it's not it's the opposite it's like
[42:43.600 --> 42:49.040]  saying up is down down is up it just shows up these are cops or their private
[42:49.040 --> 42:54.120]  contractors or Delta Force types they probably they've got the build and the
[42:54.120 --> 42:58.440]  bearing of if I had to make a guess they're probably deep cover former
[42:58.440 --> 43:05.160]  forces but but who knows these are multinational operations and of course
[43:05.160 --> 43:09.480]  they have snatching grabs and and only a few snatching grabs were an unmarked
[43:09.480 --> 43:13.360]  car pulls up and grabs people and drags them away unmarked men and uniforms are
[43:13.360 --> 43:17.640]  in plain clothes now it's people in shorts and t-shirts beating people up
[43:17.640 --> 43:21.520]  and dragging them into vans for intimidation to say look we throw a bag
[43:21.520 --> 43:25.840]  over your head and you just disappear into a black hole like this is the
[43:25.840 --> 43:33.520]  streets of Zimbabwe or something I mean you're getting grabbed and having a bag
[43:33.520 --> 43:37.240]  thrown over your head by playing clothes men to be in front of black van that is
[43:37.240 --> 43:43.840]  the ultimate evil I mean if I had to give one definition of tyranny that's it
[43:43.840 --> 43:48.560]  and so the police the media everyone is being trained that even reporters are
[43:48.560 --> 43:52.920]  knocked on the head and drug in and thrown into vans and the images of
[43:52.920 --> 43:57.080]  police helping and and and then the police chief of Toronto came out two
[43:57.080 --> 43:59.680]  weeks ago and said we're gonna have private security contractors engaging
[43:59.680 --> 44:03.960]  in arrest a special law has been passed well now the newspapers decided to read
[44:03.960 --> 44:08.680]  the law not in there it was totally illegal but see that's the precedent
[44:08.680 --> 44:15.560]  they want they set a precedent of lying they set a precedent of deceit so all of
[44:15.560 --> 44:20.880]  this is going on all of that is happening and beating up London Guardian
[44:20.880 --> 44:27.000]  reporters for no reason and beating up CTV and CBC reporters I mean these are
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.240]  national news crews and Toronto police went up to big camera crews with TV
[44:32.240 --> 44:35.840]  reporters they know and beat the daylights out of them I mean they're
[44:35.840 --> 44:40.880]  letting everybody know look we own things we got 1.2 billion to do this we
[44:40.880 --> 44:44.840]  are now mafia and they're all showing off to each other it is the ultimate
[44:44.840 --> 44:50.880]  cowardice you militarize police but the police aren't facing some some pillbox
[44:50.880 --> 44:55.160]  with hardened troops in it with grenade launchers and machine guns and bazookas
[44:55.160 --> 45:00.440]  now it's not men charging men and in bloody ditches and hand-to-hand combat
[45:00.440 --> 45:08.160]  with with daggers and guts hanging out no that no this is men playing the part
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.160]  of warriors with their arms way out to their sides like some type of rooster
[45:12.160 --> 45:16.520]  walking up and beating up little women and 10-year-old kids I mean this is the
[45:16.520 --> 45:20.480]  quintessential cowardice and let me tell you something as a man you make me
[45:20.480 --> 45:28.480]  ashamed to be a man I would be ashamed to be you there's something shameful I
[45:28.480 --> 45:32.000]  don't know even when some big guy starts a fight with you and you beat the hell
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.440]  out of them and they're on the ground and people are trying to wake them up and
[45:34.440 --> 45:38.440]  blood's coming out their ears I felt ashamed in my life when I've defended
[45:38.440 --> 45:43.640]  myself at the end of it you don't feel ashamed when you're beating up a woman
[45:43.640 --> 45:47.400]  or a child you sit there and get off on it because you're cowards you're weak
[45:47.400 --> 45:51.680]  you're pathetic you're real tough and all your body armor beaten up a London
[45:51.680 --> 45:56.800]  Guardian reporter and as soon as you take on that culture of evil how many
[45:56.800 --> 46:01.600]  people have the RNCP killed how many people have their customs killed the
[46:01.600 --> 46:07.040]  Canadians are the worst I've ever seen how many people have they killed in their
[46:07.040 --> 46:11.720]  airport oh you're some mentally retarded Polish kid a 25 years old totally
[46:11.720 --> 46:15.920]  retarded with special papers flying for your mother to pick you up your elderly
[46:15.920 --> 46:22.880]  mother and you're for 18 hours locked up you know behind glass and they won't
[46:22.880 --> 46:26.480]  get somebody to speak your language and you start arguing so you throw a chair
[46:26.480 --> 46:30.200]  throwing a fit they went in and jumped on his head and stomped on his head and
[46:30.200 --> 46:34.240]  broke his neck and then told the public oh he accidentally died even though the
[46:34.240 --> 46:37.360]  coroner said they broke his neck and the cops didn't get in trouble and the cops
[46:37.360 --> 46:43.200]  said hey we can murder retarded kids now we can we could take some some poor
[46:43.200 --> 46:47.720]  retarded person and break their neck because we're real tough we're real men
[46:47.720 --> 46:52.520]  let me tell you something cops you're helping bring in an evil that your
[46:52.520 --> 46:56.520]  family is gonna live under I want you to remember that but you're too stupid to
[46:56.520 --> 47:01.280]  even recognize it you don't even care so good God will give you what you want you
[47:01.280 --> 47:06.560]  bring the curse upon yourself and your family and your name I know a lot of
[47:06.560 --> 47:09.040]  police email me and write me they're ashamed of it when they see it as well
[47:09.040 --> 47:13.520]  and this is evil government recruiting scum to the top where the commanders tell
[47:13.520 --> 47:18.200]  their people and and incite them to engage in war crimes against us they
[47:18.200 --> 47:26.120]  are waging war against us now the list of crimes goes on and on but Charlie
[47:26.120 --> 47:32.320]  Veeth and others were inside the Toronto film studios in these little high-tech
[47:32.320 --> 47:38.200]  cages with lights on them and cameras over the toilet and being stripped
[47:38.200 --> 47:45.040]  searched you know four times as part of amelioration and being laughed at it's
[47:45.040 --> 47:47.760]  one thing if you got a strip search somebody but to get off on it and you
[47:47.760 --> 47:51.840]  know laugh at them and and we told you TSA workers keep making fun of men's
[47:51.840 --> 47:55.360]  genitals and women's genitals and now what there's been three cases of TSA
[47:55.360 --> 47:59.040]  workers beating each other up because bosses make their employees go through
[47:59.040 --> 48:04.160]  and then laugh at their at their at their male member and say look at your
[48:04.160 --> 48:07.520]  tiny you know what I mean that's that's now associated press I mean this is the
[48:07.520 --> 48:12.560]  people they're hiring folks they I mean this is can you imagine as a man wanting
[48:12.560 --> 48:17.960]  to look at a woman's breast without her permission I don't I mean the whole thing
[48:17.960 --> 48:21.720]  is about the woman wanting you and maybe I don't want them you know maybe I
[48:21.720 --> 48:29.360]  particularly want one woman you know sex is a very important special thing but
[48:29.360 --> 48:32.160]  whatever happened to modesty and decency I mean do you want your mother your
[48:32.160 --> 48:37.040]  daughter being treated like that you jackass and over and over again it's
[48:37.040 --> 48:41.680]  even been on the news even when they show the airport footage on CBS and ABC
[48:41.680 --> 48:45.360]  it'll show them smiling as some beautiful woman is in the body scanner and
[48:45.360 --> 48:49.200]  the guys are all sitting around pointing and laughing and they admittedly do this
[48:49.200 --> 48:55.760]  and so they're laughing everybody in videotaping their genitals so we know
[48:55.760 --> 49:02.800]  that was going on and now a respected reporter says that while she was in
[49:02.800 --> 49:08.400]  there inside the same facility that they were telling women we're going to rape
[49:08.400 --> 49:12.440]  you we're going to rape you we're gonna put you in a cell you're gonna get raped
[49:12.440 --> 49:15.600]  and they would strip search them over and over again and remember that famous
[49:15.600 --> 49:19.600]  video of the males men strip searching the woman as she screams and cries and
[49:19.600 --> 49:23.080]  they're grabbing her breasts and her genitals that guys will you YouTube
[49:23.080 --> 49:26.040]  police strip search woman there's a bunch of them but the one where she's just
[49:26.040 --> 49:29.320]  screaming and begging you and you hear him getting off on it we're gonna play
[49:29.320 --> 49:35.000]  that and then they reportedly started shoving their hands into the women the
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.120]  men and that's a form of rape so now in Canada and I believe this report I've
[49:41.120 --> 49:46.080]  seen these monsters now men imagine they get the woman they spread her legs I'm
[49:46.080 --> 49:49.160]  gonna play this I'm gonna play this audio coming up and children shouldn't
[49:49.160 --> 49:54.800]  listen and they just they just rape them with their hands and this is what has
[49:54.800 --> 49:58.920]  this is who they are and by the way when I was in high school we actually moved
[49:58.920 --> 50:02.280]  to Austin one of the main reasons was because I discovered the police were
[50:02.280 --> 50:06.240]  dealing drugs and I began to talk about it when they would have drug raids at
[50:06.240 --> 50:09.680]  the school I said well you guys deal the drugs everybody knows that I've I've
[50:09.680 --> 50:13.200]  been in a party when you deliver drugs and so they called me in the office and
[50:13.200 --> 50:16.360]  they said we're gonna plant stereo equipment on you and we'll hang you in
[50:16.360 --> 50:23.080]  the cell and then they found out we were moving and the cops my last day at
[50:23.080 --> 50:27.080]  high school before we moved the cop called me over to his police car in the
[50:27.080 --> 50:29.840]  parking lot and he said you're a criminal and you're gonna end up in
[50:29.840 --> 50:34.200]  prison and black men are gonna rape you in the you know what and pump AIDS into

[55:55.160 --> 56:01.080]  independent media center and other very credible organizations saying that they
[56:01.080 --> 56:05.320]  were stripped searched over and over again as a form of torture that men would
[56:05.320 --> 56:10.040]  do it and that they would also force their fingers inside the women and
[56:10.040 --> 56:14.440]  they're lucky it wasn't a toilet plunger like in New York City remember oh
[56:14.440 --> 56:19.640]  that wasn't true for a year oh it's not true the officers didn't do that finally
[56:19.640 --> 56:24.160]  cops when public said yeah and it was incredible how could the commander that
[56:24.160 --> 56:29.000]  made the cops hold the guy down it said for two hours he did it I mean how
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.760]  could you stay angry enough even if you could do that to somebody who'd say
[56:31.760 --> 56:36.400]  killed your kids how could you do it for hours just I'll show you no this was a
[56:36.400 --> 56:43.360]  demonic worm let's go ahead and play this reporter's information let's go
[56:43.360 --> 56:47.600]  ahead and play this reporter and what she had to say about being inside journalists
[56:47.600 --> 56:51.720]  Toronto police actually is molested women at g20 independent journalist Amy
[56:51.720 --> 56:57.320]  Miller here it is Amy Miller I was detained yesterday at approximately noon
[56:57.320 --> 57:01.960]  I was with Adam as well as one other colleague we were on our way to cover
[57:01.960 --> 57:09.240]  the jail solidarity action on the way on Bloor near Bay because we saw a group
[57:09.240 --> 57:24.880]  of young people being detained and being searched and held down and then I
[57:24.880 --> 57:30.720]  was detained for nearly 13 hours I was placed in a cell at the Toronto film
[57:30.720 --> 57:38.160]  studio and with I was in a cell with 25 other young women for approximately 13
[57:38.160 --> 57:45.240]  hours throughout the time that I was detained I was told many statements that
[57:45.240 --> 57:49.320]  I find repulsive and completely inappropriate and what I view as
[57:49.320 --> 57:53.600]  threats I was told I was gonna be raped I was told I was gonna be gang bang I was
[57:53.600 --> 57:56.280]  told that they were gonna make sure that I was never gonna want to act as a
[57:56.280 --> 58:00.880]  journalist again by making sure that I would be repeatedly raped while I was
[58:00.880 --> 58:06.520]  in jail when I was in the detention center I saw numerous young women who
[58:06.520 --> 58:11.600]  were completely strip searched who were switched strip searched by officer male
[58:11.600 --> 58:16.080]  who were strip searched by male officers and one young woman when she was
[58:16.080 --> 58:19.480]  coming out who was completely traumatized said that she had had a
[58:19.480 --> 58:24.400]  finger put up her and I find this completely unacceptable and I hope that
[58:24.400 --> 58:29.080]  people will investigate this because from what I saw in the cell from the
[58:29.080 --> 58:32.040]  women who were getting coming out who were being strip searched they were
[58:32.040 --> 58:36.240]  definitely traumatized and there was very much violence that was targeted to
[58:36.240 --> 58:38.680]  young women

[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:33.360]  Alex Jones
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.480]  my friends I am just dumbfounded I want to believe in the police we've been
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.520]  militarized and turned against us worldwide I want to believe they wouldn't
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.600]  follow illegal orders I wanted to believe in Denver that the police weren't
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.000]  dressed up like anarchists attack on their own officers to demonize the
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.040]  peaceful protesters but it came out in the Denver post because the police
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:58.240]  department was forced to admit it was true it came out in the Toronto Star
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.880]  they've done this over and over again I mean they've been caught on national
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.880]  news in Greece the police knocking out windows and burning buildings to blame
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:10.320]  it on the anti-bank activist our media keeps calling all the anti-bank people
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.280]  communist the bankers are the ones that are funding communism to take your
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:20.520]  wealth and give it to themselves and now will g20 police succeed in covering up
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:25.400]  report of rape and torture you just heard me play a clip of a reporter talking
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.240]  about now the police told her she saw them beating people so she was covering
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.200]  it they arrested her another journalist once they got her there they said we're
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.240]  gonna rape you we're gonna have other people rape you and I remember my one
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.560]  experience with police threatening to have me raped well I've had two
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:47.480]  experiences with as a juvenile for stations has just joined us I was 16
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:53.960]  and I didn't do drugs but I went to parties and I knew people you know a
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.320]  lot of people did and I had seen sheriff's deputies and others deliver
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.800]  drugs and I was shocked by it by the time I was 12 I'd seen it just in the
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.440]  neighborhood I'd be able to friend's house from after playing baseball drinking
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:12.160]  Kool-Aid and her Capri son and you know I'd see a sheriff's car pull up and they
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.240]  be with a guy's older brother and I said what was he doing all my brother gets
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.440]  drugs from him and sells it and of course you know the big brother was the
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.480]  coolest guy in the school I mean he literally had all the cheerleaders
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.560]  football everything nobody suspected the preppy guy and so it was the cool house
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.600]  to hang around you know you'd be 12 years old watching the 17 year old cheerleader
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.800]  and they just look like Marilyn Monroe to a 12 year old and I just you know I
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.640]  just saw the right things you know I was in the right place the right time or
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.280]  the wrong place the wrong time pinger perspective I think was the right place
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.200]  the right time to and so they'd have weird drug testing at the school and
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:50.640]  dare programs and and and everybody would swear up and down that they weren't
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.420]  gonna use drugs they'd have drug dogs and they'd call us in the auditorium and
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.840]  tell us not to use drugs and I'd be looking at cops I knew were involved in
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.960]  drugs in the auditorium giving speeches and I just would tell people you know
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.760]  one time cops pulled me over and I had a six pack occurs light and I said you
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.000]  know I know you're my eyes are involved in drugs you're gonna take me to jail
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.520]  for this beer and they said you bet we are Jones you're gonna get hung in your
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:19.200]  cell you ought to watch your butt that was you know back in the like 1990 so
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.080]  they didn't nobody had cameras or recorders back then they're and then
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.760]  like I said the last day of school because my parents heard about it the
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:34.560]  police contacted a local lawyer and the message was given and the lawyer told
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.160]  my dad you know people hang themselves in Rockwall County there have been a
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.640]  lot of deaths in the jail and you're best get out of town and my dad was
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.800]  like you know what he was already selling his dental office he was gonna
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.640]  start another one in Dallas he's my mom always wanted to move back to Austin
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.280]  it's where she's from we said let's just go to Austin but there was the cop
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:04.280]  waiting the last day my last day of school and there I was and he pulled up
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.840]  and he said Alex you're leaving and he said but we're gonna get you you're
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.400]  gonna be put in prison when a big black man he said a big n-word is gonna rape
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:19.160]  you and give you AIDS and he said we're gonna get you and I just said well I
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:24.720]  said okay and I couldn't tell it was a bluff or what it was we said we'll we'll
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.440]  let him know down in Austin you're coming a criminal like you never gets
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:41.600]  away with it for long and that guy was one of the cops at the school and he
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:48.520]  owned a bar locally I guess to cover up where his money came from that's who
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.240]  they are and they run everything they're the mafia the media teaches you to
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:57.680]  worship worship at the feet of a group is turning into total devils that's a
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:04.760]  fact the question is where should the American people draw their line in the
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:10.240]  sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.720]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two

[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.880]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:25.840]  I'm gonna cover the latest developments in the Gulf of the Gulf of Mexico in the
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:32.160]  Persian Gulf as things heat up I mean every day we're just inching towards war
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:37.720]  with Iran and there's a psychological effect I've noticed that if you've been
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:45.040]  hearing about how there's gonna be war with Iraq for 13 years from 1990 91
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:50.800]  until 2003 even if you're against war you almost expect it to happen it's kind
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.600]  of like well let's get it over with and they know that they just wear you out
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.600]  always gearing up for it but now the stars have aligned now all the
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:05.960]  evidences they are moving in the next week the next month the next year the
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.680]  green light has been given we don't know when the hammer is gonna drop but
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:13.320]  right now I'd say it's about a 90% chance they're gonna hit Iran the
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:18.080]  decision has been made they may retract it or Iran may properly groveled but
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:22.560]  they've got to agree to give BP who formerly ran the country until 53 all
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.000]  the oil it's always BP it's always Goldman Sachs always the same players was
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:35.480]  Anglo-American oil previously Iran co they've had many names but they are
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:40.200]  moving and I don't think Iran will submit and I don't think there's any way
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.680]  for him to submit because every time they try to submit the globalists just
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.160]  re-intensify their operations they need a new war they need a political
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.320]  distraction they need an excuse to move more forces into Central Asia to
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.320]  threaten Russia and of course they've got to deal with China we're also gonna
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:00.520]  talk about the Russian spy situation coming up but I I do want to open the
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:05.800]  phones we're gonna have wide open phones throughout the day we're going to have
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:11.080]  Dan Dix from press for truth great reporter I've done for years who will
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:15.960]  work with Charlie Beach of the love police British activists from Scotland
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.120]  who has been arrested twice now he's being charged with serious felony
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.800]  crimes impersonating a police officer for calling himself the love police
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:28.600]  getting smart mouth in one of the video saying oh yes I'm an undercover that's
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.680]  gonna stage you know events for the police you know as you guys did hear a
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.440]  few years ago and so they're using that and then him going I'm an absurdist
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.000]  filmmaker I mean he's out there being sarcastic and so they've gone and
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  arrested him for that very very serious but but quite frankly their political
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:56.200]  persecution of Charlie Beach is nothing compared to women cornered and there's a
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.720]  lot of bloggers and a lot of reports coming out that this indeed did happen
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:07.120]  and since it's happened to me my two early experiences with police once I
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.640]  found out the police were dealing drugs in Rockwall I didn't even go to the other
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.520]  police I didn't call the media I just would shoot my mouth off a couple times
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:21.160]  about hey I know you guys are involved in drugs because I'd seen it I'd seen it
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.680]  and they called me in the office and said we're gonna plant stolen stereo
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:29.920]  equipment on you and I said I'd never stolen anything but beer years ago out
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.480]  of a golf cart and he goes oh really I'll have to look into that you know
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.280]  because you think you'll be honest with these people and it means anything no
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.080]  no no they're the bad guys when they're bad there's nothing worse than a bad cop
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.120]  and they're everywhere let's just be honest about that there's a reason the
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.320]  media has all these cop shows about worshiping cops there's a reason they're
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.480]  always cramming it down our throat because the truth is the established
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.560]  what's trying to make cops corrupt and it happens on its own easy enough
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:58.240]  anybody abuses power that's just common sense the founders taught us that you
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.640]  take anybody and give them power statistically the majority of the time
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.400]  you're gonna end up getting monsters on your hands then you get a bunch of
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.640]  monsters together and they start competing with each other they start
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:14.760]  getting away with more and more but but side issue in my few experiences with
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:20.160]  cops you know one time some big old redneck started to fight with me and he
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.760]  got me down on the ground so that was a problem so I had to turn on the turn on
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.960]  the Jews turn on the canna you know what and I got up and beat the daylights out
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:34.360]  of him stomped him good so I wouldn't have to keep fighting and he was hurt
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.840]  real bad and the cops showed up and what were they supposed to do you know one
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:42.520]  guy was unconscious and people said well this big guy started the fight with a
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.200]  little guy because I was a little guy about 160 pounds back then when I was
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:51.280]  15 years old and they said well we're gonna take you to jail and I was there
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.200]  for three days they put me in jail on a Friday didn't get out till Monday in
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:13:01.800]  court I've told the story before and it was at the Terrell juvenile detention
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:07.800]  center two floors on top the Terrell courthouse the city of Terrell for
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:12.120]  whatever that county is and this potbellied pervert came and said it's
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.760]  time for you take your shower it's your shower time because you gotta let out
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:20.160]  about an hour a day to take a shower than any extra time you could sit there
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.480]  and watch whatever was on the TV you couldn't change the channel so you're
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:27.560]  out for one hour a day and he started getting in the shower telling me I was
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.960]  good-looking and he wanted to take good care of me while I was there and I said
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.480]  listen I'm not into this and he said well shove me and said bend over and I
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:39.760]  said you may get away with this but I'm gonna go public and my dad's gonna kill
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.480]  you and he said get out of here you're not getting a shower or out for the
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.920]  next so the next few days I wasn't out of there I didn't get to get out of the
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.280]  cell so so that's what America's run by okay perverts that want to rate I think
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:57.440]  I was actually 14 I'm 14 or 15 and and then you know you're 16 trying to leave
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.200]  the town because you know they're drug dealers and they're death-threading you
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.640]  when they're we're gonna put you in jail one day and black men are gonna rape you
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:08.880]  and give you AIDS so I've experienced it I don't I mean I know it goes on I mean
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:14.600]  who was the fellow in New York who got raped with the plunger till his guts
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:24.440]  came out remember that guy all because at a nightclub somebody punched a cop and
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:28.280]  so the cops waited outside and randomly arrested a bunch of people it turned out
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:36.000]  they later got the footage and he was not the one that had even punched the
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:51.240]  God and and we know this goes on and now at the G20 the police make up a law
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:57.120]  that doesn't exist and arrest over 600 innocent people beat up London Guardian
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:09.600]  reporters CTV national television hosts CBC yeah Diallo was the guy 23-year-old
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:17.040]  gown and immigrant in New York City he was shot and killed that's another one
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:23.920]  no no this is not the guy that got sodomized with a plunger that's another
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:27.480]  one of the famous cases and let me tell you something I've been polite to New
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.840]  York cops I've seen them be mean to old ladies I've seen them be mean to
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:36.120]  families I mean they relish being mean to good people they I mean that just they
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:41.160]  have hired a bunch of goons they look like goons now some of them are nice but
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:46.040]  I'd say most of them are a bunch of power tripping lunatics and the issue is
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.560]  that's what the system wants they want people it'll attack old ladies with a
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.920]  police dog in Pittsburgh because they come out of a grocery store with a bag
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.800]  and they say nobody's allowed on the streets and a little ladies like okay
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.640]  officer but I'm I'm grocery shopping and they release a German shepherd on her
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.520]  that's what your tax money pays for your tax money goes to give tens of
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.520]  trillions of dollars to offshore banks that won't tell us where the money's
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:12.880]  gone so they can take over our entire financial system and literally sees our
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.320]  entire infrastructure and destroy our way of life but because they go and hire
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:22.720]  a bunch of low IQ sadist who'll sit there and stomp on us and enforce
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:25.440]  tyranny down our throats I mean this this has happened in every other country
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:29.520]  and now it's happened in America and we've got to really get honest that we
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.240]  got too many cops they're out of control they've been empowered out however they
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:40.320]  want and they act the same everywhere so the big story here is and I'm asking
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.480]  everybody to get this out to everyone they know will G20 police succeed in
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:52.800]  covering up reports of rape and torture now Canada is officially the most
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.600]  oppressive and backward dictatorship in the West will authorities be allowed to
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.280]  cover up the Abu Ghraib style incarceration methods of Toronto police
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.920]  engaged in during the G20 summit this past weekend where women were arrested
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:10.920]  and subsequently raped by male cops and by the way that under law if you do rape
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:15.960]  someone with your hand that's even in the army report from Abu Ghraib the
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.280]  Tugumu report that it was it counts as rape under federal international law
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:24.600]  they use flashlights there and it counted as rape penetration with any object is
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:35.760]  rape it's not just molestation it was Loema Abner Loema that got tortured with
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:43.440]  the well it just came out a few weeks ago that the cops lied because the video
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.560]  got released where they just beat some guy and pepper sprayed him and tasered
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:57.360]  him for no reason in a subway I mean where are the police unions to crying
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.680]  what happened in Toronto no they're gonna back up their brothers their brother
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:07.800]  isn't freedom and liberty no their brother is that thug system it's gang
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:12.600]  mentality I mean go find some Crip or some blood or some Mexican mafia guy or
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:17.320]  some Aryan nations you know prison gang person and they'll kill they'll lie
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.000]  they'll steal they'll do anything because of their brotherhood it's all it is
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.560]  it's just gang mentality read your own gang handbook cops and look in the
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:29.160]  mirror and ask yourself what you've been turned into via peer pressure and
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:36.400]  tribal manipulation in the video below journalist Amy Miller describes how
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.320]  women arrested by Toronto police were threatened with rape the numerous
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.600]  women were stripped searched by male officers and that one severely
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.560]  traumatized woman was sexually molested by police who stuck their fingers up her
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.960]  and leave it at that sexual penetration of individuals against their will is
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.440]  called rape these reports are accurate and there is no reason to think
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.160]  otherwise given everything else we've witnessed only over the past few days
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.080]  but over the past several years in Canada Toronto police officers are not
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.920]  only brutal thugs who like to lie about the law unlawfully arrest people
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.800]  snatch and grab protesters using unmarked cars and beat up journalists for
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:16.960]  major newspapers but they also are rapist who prey on innocent women we
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.080]  have now learned that Toronto police chief Bill Blair engaged in a mass
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:24.840]  public deception by lying about the claim that Toronto's public acts mandated
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.960]  G20 protesters who show their ID or could be secretly arrested or couldn't
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:37.040]  videotape we've got all that on tape just total lies just like I see more and
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.360]  more videos of cops walking up in England in the U.S. saying you can't
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.600]  videotape they're like well yes I can they just beat them up and arrest them
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:51.360]  you're here to pay my salary blood bag and that's it remember America is the
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:55.880]  land of the blood bag so is Canada so is England we are blood bags the

[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:35.040]  for a non-existent law that's in the Toronto Star that you said there's a
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.080]  new law that we can arrest you for any reason and there's a new law you can't
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:46.440]  videotape turns out another hoax of false arrest and so he's one of the a few
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.080]  videos out there where they are arresting people under the non-existent law
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:55.080]  they arrested over 600 using it but this is where it's on tape the cops you know
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:58.880]  quoting the non-existent law so they went back and said oh he's calling
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:07.880]  himself the love police well that's that's impersonating an officer well
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.160]  let me tell you the cops in Toronto are the ones impersonating a peace officer
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:18.040]  what you are is NKVD thugs you need to go find a time machine and teleport
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:24.480]  yourself back to the 1950s you could go lick Joe Stalin's boots again why does
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:27.840]  everybody know the cops are bad in China they're bad in Russia they were
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:32.400]  they're bad in Mexico everybody who the cops bad but here because we've been so
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.400]  brainwashed by TV and let me tell you America did have the best cops in the
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.320]  world I've done a lot of historical research and study because they were
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.760]  locally controlled they were very professional they were constitutionalist
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:47.720]  most of them Chicago and New York were the first to get taken down by mafia
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.440]  style cops in the last hundred years and it's just gotten worse from there
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:59.880]  Dallas is mafia run Miami's mafia run LA's got the Vikings they've got a
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:05.880]  secret mafia group but I've met some of them they claim their patriots I I don't
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.560]  even know anymore I just can't handle it why why do you have to work for these
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:13.520]  criminal banks I mean it's the criminal bankers who should all go to jail for
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.720]  what they've done with derivatives who won't say where the trillions went that
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:21.800]  come to your town do you think you're gonna have any future cops and can you
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:26.760]  use your head 1.2 billion in security right at as much as the city budget of
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.640]  Toronto a year to protect a bunch of thugs who should have just met in one
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.600]  building you know they demand all this security because they can meet all over
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:38.000]  the city so the whole city can be locked down because they're the real
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.400]  government they're the private bankers coming to town I'm gonna cover that
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.960]  coming up in the next segment then the Russian spies then the hurricane then the
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:54.960]  Iran situation and we'll talk to Dan dick of or Dan dicks of press for truth
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.960]  coming up the hearing is in the next hour supposedly but who knows if that
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.720]  will happen we'll get him on regardless for the show ends working with Charlie
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:08.280]  Beach over there but will g20 police succeed in covering up reports of rape
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.800]  and torture important article prison planet dot com we got a force this into
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.120]  the mainstream news and the video reports and journalists talking about it
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.360]  right there here's another one the star no extra powers granted to police during
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.400]  g20 summit it was all a lie the globe and mail police admit no five meter rule
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:30.280]  existed on security fence law and I've got other articles g20 security fence
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:36.040]  five meter rule never existed they arrested Charlie for not showing ID and
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:45.320]  for quote video taping near the fence here's the disinfo headline a news 1130
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.120]  it's also in several newspapers UK man arrested for impersonating officer
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.000]  prior to g20 summit but you got to love all the comments on these newspapers and
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.760]  radio station it's like the police are impersonating Canadian citizens they're
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.680]  impersonating peace officers you know Canada's now fallen into darkness we
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:07.160]  now know see Canadians are really nice cool smart educated sweet people the
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:12.400]  cliche of Canadians being nice is true in my experience the stereotype is
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:18.960]  accurate but they are oblivious the greatest evils grow in the shadow of
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:26.000]  goodness because they're gullible just like the American people you're gullible
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.760]  stop being gullible all I want is to have good police officers all I want is
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:35.480]  to have good mayors and good Congress people and the cops are a lot better
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.240]  than people above them but they're trying to warp you they're trying to make it
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:43.760]  macho and cool you know kill a commie for mommy but you don't kill commies for
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.600]  mommy you're not fighting VC that are shooting back you're beating up little
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:52.200]  women and they put you in these Darth Vader outfits when they know
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:55.800]  psychologically not only does a Darth Vader outfit scare people as they
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:00.760]  admit that's the intent but the the wearer I mean I've joked around in
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:05.040]  Halloween and dressed up you know like a monster and you know catch myself
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.280]  running around that kind of acting wild and or you know dress up like Darth
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:13.720]  Vader for a skid I did for TV and catch myself you know acting all crazy they
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:16.920]  have a Warner Brothers Looney Tunes cartoon where they put different hats on
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:20.320]  Elmer Fudd and they show how he behaves in a different way well that's actually
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:26.680]  been shown firefighters are true public servants true heroes now the feds are
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:29.680]  trying to federalize them and turn them into spies and warp and ruin those
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:34.200]  great men and women they're trying to turn our military against us but then
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:37.480]  you get the internal reports the police are being trained to go after the
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:41.080]  military because they don't trust you police and military they hate your guts
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:46.640]  they know you might wake up and actually become patriots we'll get into some

[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.600]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:23.880]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:32.360]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:36.080]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:40.240]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:35.080]  ladies and gentlemen Reuters is reporting that Obama is now beginning the process to allow
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:40.360]  international help to come in but he has his lawyers in the EPA are now going
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:44.240]  into a process that may take weeks or months kind of like they claimed a
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:48.480]  month ago that the media was allowed to be on the beach but then the order still
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:54.960]  stood in effect that the media could not be on the beach there's no law that the
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.880]  feds can do that they have no jurisdiction they just have people that
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:02.200]  will arrest you and so people get intimidated and acquiesce to the
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:08.040]  tyrannical precedent and here's just more proof of that I'm gonna cover it more
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:16.200]  later oil spill visits get partisan oil spill visits get partisan politico
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:21.320]  and it turns out that ten lawmakers wish to have a congressional trip to the
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:29.680]  gulf and be able to be given a tour and house Democrats said you are not allowed
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:36.000]  in the area so now now elected representatives of this country are not
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.760]  allowed to go down there and look oh yeah Obama's not blocking the media even
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.680]  though it keeps happening every day we're now 70 plus days into this there's one
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:51.760]  Taiwanese ship they've been offering for over a month that can skim 500,000
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:59.520]  barrels that's the Associated Press 500,000 barrels a day more than all the
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:05.040]  US relief ships combined but it's not allowed and they've got more than 30
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.880]  some estimates are more than 50 in this hemisphere of Dutch and German and
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:13.800]  Norwegian and Japanese ships they can do the same thing and they are not allowed
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:20.640]  they could clean that up but not soon now the swells are six to ten feet now
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:24.120]  that hurricane and there's gonna be ones that are worse because the one comes
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:27.720]  right up towards Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida it'll drive it all in this
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:31.440]  is just a glancing blow but it is sending big swells in that are driving that
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:37.280]  oil towards the beach and now in the next few days hell is gonna hit oh and
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:41.200]  Obama won't let a good crisis go to waste good thing he dumped all his
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.840]  vanguard stock in BP the week before good thing the BP CEO did too good thing
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:53.720]  Goldman Sachs dumped 44% oh good thing BP controlled by Goldman Sachs that runs
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:58.600]  the entire White House and Kagan gave the order for unconventional drilling and
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:03.120]  the oil rig operators the engineers said it will blow up two months before and
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:08.080]  through fits for two months but followed orders and it blew up they blew that
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:11.600]  thing up on purpose and they blocked all the relief efforts and they blocked
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:15.160]  the ships coming in and now the stinking hurricanes are coming and they're
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:19.280]  saying president hold them as long as you can it's already spread across the
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:23.080]  Gulf even the biggest ships are in have trouble getting to all the oil just
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:27.120]  block them a few more weeks and another big hurricanes coming in and we'll get
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:33.840]  the civil emergency in the Gulf remember what congressman senator Kyle said two
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:40.800]  weeks ago he went into Obama in a private meeting we played the clip here he
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:44.600]  told the town hall and he went to Obama and he said listen there's mass murder
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:48.320]  and thousands dead on the border it's totally collapsed 80 to 100 miles in
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:52.200]  they've totally taken over the police are begging for help it's a total
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.800]  collapse we need the military and he said well I'm gonna use that crisis down
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:01.280]  there to get the reform pass which is legalization and he said mr. president
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:05.880]  that's that's terrorism that's holding a sausage the president said well that's
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:12.080]  what I'm doing of course they're accentuating the border crisis by
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.160]  cracking down on cartels they don't control to start a drug war of course
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:22.320]  they're blocking the oil relief of course they are they blew the oil well
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:26.320]  either they did it by orders they knew would cause it or but a lot of eye
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:30.480]  witnesses and reports are proving an unauthorized secret change was made and
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:34.320]  we know the feds were on board when it happened an unscheduled visit and it
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:39.280]  blew up you can just see them planting the plastic on that sucker and look at
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.200]  all their responses since then look at everything they've done they need this
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:50.320]  diversion while they get the Iran war ready they need this diversion they need
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:58.320]  this diversion right now they need it while they get their carbon tax through
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.080]  I told you he'd call for a carbon tax to quote fix this and they have now I'm
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.680]  gonna go to your calls right now we're gonna quick report coming up a little
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:09.480]  while from Dan Dix who's friends with the beach and has been part of the video
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:13.920]  reports we've had in the last five days here on Friday and on Sunday and on
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:17.600]  Monday and Tuesday and now it's Wednesday we're getting another report from
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.760]  them but coming up also dollars should be replaced as international standard for
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.760]  you in report but I want to say this finally and I'm gonna cover more in the
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:33.440]  next hour why if this oil rig is 40 plus miles off the coast international water
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:40.040]  start 12 miles out why are international companies not coming into the
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:45.240]  Gulf because the US tells them not to BP is a sovereign corporate government
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:50.080]  just like the Vatican just like Israel just like just like some low lowly UN
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.080]  clerk has diplomatic immunity to rape and kill and rob banks and slap cops
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:59.360]  upside the head and you notice when a cop does something to some arrogant UN
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:04.200]  diplomat and stands up for themselves the cop gets fired immediately like in
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:10.880]  Houston when the guy reportedly just basically spit in the cops face and
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.520]  shoved him so the cops slammed him down and arrested him oh the cops in big
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:19.640]  trouble you know UN officials are caught with with sex slaves in their
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:22.560]  houses and shipping drugs in they don't get in trouble because they're
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.840]  diplomatic immunity and BP that's what the new world order is they're a bunch
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:31.400]  offshore corporate pirates they declare themselves sovereign immunity they're
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:37.400]  out 40 something miles in the Gulf they cause a giant oil spill and Obama comes
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:42.280]  in and says states and counties and cities can't clean stuff up even on
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:45.920]  their own shore or inland in their rivers and waterways and estuaries and
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:50.640]  wetlands 10 miles in the feds have declared jurisdiction over those those
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.400]  states total out of control behavior you got all these international groups
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.800]  want to come in and help and they're waiting sucking their thumbs because
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:09.160]  Obama won't let them and now 10 members of Congress wanted to be able to have a
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:16.760]  tour this is confirmed and the Democrats say you're not allowed to look and I
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:21.280]  guarantee you if a congressman if a senator showed up and wanted to show
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:27.040]  the oil spill they just have some goons arrest them because in America it's all
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:30.160]  about working for the bankers and the stinking oil companies that are owned by
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:35.600]  the banks and if you do you can do whatever you want and BP picked an area
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.360]  right off our coast and they pulled this because they've invested tens of
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:44.040]  billions in the carbon tax garbage and they're not in the accustomed to losing
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:47.320]  and they need their global tax what do you think's gonna back up these new
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:53.120]  private sdr's they're announcing that in the dollar it's environment taxes
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.680]  that's the public plan they've got to have it their entire agenda and just like
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:04.760]  in chess to win it chess you've got to know your opponent you've got to have
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:08.760]  patience you've got to know your opponent three things you've got to have
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.520]  patience know your opponent and be willing to make sacrifices and I'm not a
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:19.000]  very good chess player but in the last few years I've gotten back into playing
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.040]  and I play my son and you know what he's he's about to be eight years old and
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:29.000]  he's really smart a lot smarter than I am it's incredible he has a truly
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:36.640]  photographic memory but the only way I can beat him now because we've been
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.480]  playing chess about six years about four years actually I should play since
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:48.720]  he's about four you know four years the only way I can beat him is sacrifice he
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:51.840]  doesn't understand that yet he just can't get it now and I beat him every
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.760]  time I play him a straight-up game he can look at all the moves and all the
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:58.600]  pieces and the game goes on for like 20 minutes and I'm kind of halfway paying
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:03.320]  attention if I actually focus I can always beat him but begin I'm not that
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:06.160]  good of a chess player but he is good for his age we put him in a few chess
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:13.400]  camps too he's learned some tricks but he doesn't understand sacrifice the
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:17.040]  globalist did folks the globalist Japan had already unconditionally
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:23.280]  surrendered and they dropped a bombs on them just to impress everybody you think
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.640]  your life means anything to the New World Order and do you cops out there I
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:32.760]  don't want to be your enemy I mean I did have cops tell me how that was going to
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:37.040]  be raped when I was a kid I did have a jail guard try to rape me when I was in
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:41.760]  juvenile one time you know I I have seen all the reports of cops waiting
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.440]  outside topless bars and raping women in every major city they get caught
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:49.640]  constantly you get a bunch of lunatics who want power and you guys have got to
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:55.040]  kick those people out not promote them and praise them and defend them let's
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:58.160]  take a few calls because I
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:14.920]  we're gonna take calls from Laura Tim John Joe Jason and others John in
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:25.320]  London Laura and I want others I'll take a gamut of calls or two again but not
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:30.040]  again but I'll take some of those and then I'm gonna get into the oil spill
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.840]  I'm gonna get into Iran I'm gonna get to the Russian spy stuff I didn't cover
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:37.120]  that the first two days I wanted to analyze it and look at it my research
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:42.920]  says yeah they're spies I mean I ought to get Tarpley on here God love him he's a
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:47.280]  great guy his info checks out almost all the time but I saw him on TV saying
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:53.680]  that these people look more like reporters than spies Tarpley God love
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.640]  him I mean you got husband and wife teams with fake names that are illegal
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:03.600]  aliens operating under fake names they're spies okay and I guess his point is
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.680]  that yeah they're just here getting intelligence and that's normal and and
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:12.680]  you know what that is standard operating procedure but just because our
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.280]  government's overrun with traders and overrun with banks and corporations of
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:21.160]  the real national security threat and the globalism itself is high treason and
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:25.360]  is about global corporations overthrowing your nation I mean globalization is
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:30.760]  treason back that's an Alex Jones quote globalization is treason against
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:36.320]  national sovereignty it is a corporate criminal takeover and so just because
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:40.120]  the nation's run by criminals and is a whorehouse where if you're a British or
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:44.400]  Israeli spy you can run entire departments and and Israel has more
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.680]  control over our Pentagon than our own government does Israel brags about that
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:52.000]  I mean that's espionage that's wrong as an American I speak out against it and
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.560]  get criticized for it and Russia is as crooked as a barrel of snakes but the
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:04.720]  issue is all this hysteria and hyperventilating over these spies is a
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:09.680]  joke the new Cold War is back and that's why they decided to bust them you know
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.640]  they knew they were here seven years ago probably longer they knew day one how
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:19.200]  infiltrated do you think the Russian government is by by the corporate CIA
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:23.200]  people that run our government they infiltrate all the drug cartels they
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:27.120]  infiltrate the drug companies they enter they infiltrate the media they
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:32.200]  infiltrate everything this is the big empire they're the best they're the
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:39.840]  most evil it's just they are now demonizing Russia because they're
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:43.880]  gearing up for World War three ladies and gentlemen teamed up with China the
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:47.000]  United States has teamed up with China let me tell you something China is a
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.960]  lot more evil than Russia and China openly with Henry Kissinger and all
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:57.920]  these other government officials for decades has a direct line into all US
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:04.120]  intelligence technology business deals everything our government is in a merger
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:09.400]  with China and so you got a pack of criminals they're selling out our
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:14.160]  nation of the global corporate banking cartel who can then point their fingers
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:18.280]  at the Russians and say and I heard Laura Ingram this morning I was driving to
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:22.360]  work it was the craziest thing Laura Ingram was saying the Russians have in
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:26.840]  infiltrated us because Obama is weak and look at him with Medvedev eating
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:32.080]  hamburgers last week this is word for word and she had some writer on named
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:38.200]  Thor going yes Obama allowed the Ruskies to infiltrate Obama is a CIA agent on
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:45.280]  record Obama is a complete black-op operator Obama is a 100% new world
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:56.720]  order shill this is ridiculous and if these Russian spies were here seven
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:01.480]  years ago that puts it square at the feet of George W. Bush and I'm not
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.680]  defending Obama they all work for the same people it's a complete joke our
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:09.640]  stinking government on record Fletcher Proudy all of them documented it's now
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:19.760]  declassified put put linen in power they funded Ho Chi men they stage all this
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:25.480]  stuff they put Mao into power on record now it's declassified they put Saddam
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:31.800]  into power they created al-Qaeda that's why these people can't be beat because
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:35.600]  the public will not wake up and think at a high level three-dimensional level
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.320]  it's like three-dimensional chess and realize the game we're fighting here
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:44.200]  these people create a web a full spectrum of false information they are
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:49.200]  not Americans the bankers that run America hate this country they are the
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:55.280]  ultimate traders so I say arrest Russian spies and execute them and I say
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:00.000]  arrest all the banker corporate spies and execute them I say take every anti
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.200]  American piece of trash and put them before a jury and then give them the
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:09.360]  death sentence but I don't want to sit here and hear about how the Ruskies are
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:16.640]  going to get us all day and kill us I don't want to hear about it so the
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:20.200]  criminal traders that run our government can sit there and point their
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:25.000]  finger at Russia and and then so they can look like patriots the real traders
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.920]  are the ones running our country and I want them out of here I want the
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:34.200]  Goldman Sachs people arrested you're gonna arrest these two-bit Russian spies
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:39.840]  good now you arrest the Goldman Sachs hijackers all right let's suffer this
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:44.000]  segment the rest the next segment give your report on Charlie Beach with Dan
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:50.200]  Dix and press for truth has been kind enough to join us during the G20 G8 and
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:54.440]  to break down what's happening he's about to go into the court hearing go
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:59.480]  over it what's happened to to mr. Beach because he is now a political prisoner
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:06.040]  Dan just outside the courthouse now we're gonna go in and I'll sign for his
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:11.120]  assurity and try to post his bail so that we can so that we can get him out
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:16.520]  of there this of course is all because of the police saw the video that we
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:22.000]  posted where Charlie was talking to a security guard and he was a very very
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.640]  obviously joking the whole video he is doing what Charlie does best which is
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:33.560]  brings and you know he raises love and lowers fear and brings in an element of
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:38.600]  humor to his activism so he was telling the guard you know I'm British
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:43.600]  intelligence I'm Metro police and as soon as they saw the video they put out
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:48.280]  a warrant for his arrest and stopped him at the airport now I do have
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.360]  information it's not confirmed until I get out of the courthouse but I believe
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:59.520]  his options are going to be to either plead guilty and be deported back to the
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:04.400]  UK or if he wants to plead innocent he's most likely not going to be able to
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:09.960]  lead the country and it will have to stay here until his court hearing and
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:13.320]  Canada is a nation that will arrest people for their speech and ship them to
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:18.120]  foreign nations so they're a very evil government he's in a lot of trouble and
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:21.960]  the really crazy thing is this whole thing stems from the original arrest
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:26.680]  and that's why we post the video and the Toronto Chief of Police here in
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:32.160]  Toronto Bill Blair has just announced that there was no law he cannot plead
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:36.280]  guilty because they'll even change the deal on him that way he's got to go
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:41.040]  ahead and ride it out this will become a big international situation stay there
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.760]  I want to talk to you more about his case and how we help him in the final
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:47.000]  segment how you've got to get into the building and then join us after you try
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.120]  to bail him out and after you've seen the trial towards the end of the show we
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:53.720]  have to go into overdrive and then also want to get into the women's saying they
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:58.920]  saw police raping them with objects so the police are now reportedly raping
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:03.560]  women I'll be right back hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:07.120]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:10.880]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:14.400]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:17.400]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:21.200]  even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together

[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:26.360]  with the political prisoner Charlie Beach of the love police who clearly watch
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:33.880]  the videos joking saying oh yes I'm British MI6 I'm local police I've been
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:37.520]  hired to stage events to blame it on the protesters like you guys did a few
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:41.600]  years ago I'm the love police here to bring love this would be like somebody
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.600]  in a Ronald McDonald outfit and they claim he was impersonating the
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.800]  president but it just shows meanwhile foreign bankers a lot of them with a
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.680]  rest warrants can fly into town like George Soros and the police just lick
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:59.000]  their boots finishing up and then popping in after the court hearing that
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.040]  you're about to be at Dan Dex a press for truth give us any other intel you've
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:10.160]  got yeah Alex P they literally needed an excuse because of his political message
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:15.160]  in order to to try to spiteful his efforts I just got out of the cab I'm
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:18.960]  right in front of the courthouse now his hearing is in about two minutes so
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:22.760]  unfortunately I'm gonna have to get in there oh I just heard he is out now
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:28.160]  he's coming out right now amazing so maybe we'll stick around there's a lot
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:31.400]  of reporters here he's coming out right now please let us talk to him first
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:35.320]  before he talks to the reporters yeah absolutely we talk to him first please
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.880]  yeah he needs to point out he's a political prisoner and this is all
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:45.280]  trumped up yeah he's looking for him now he's supposed to be coming out now
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:49.560]  there's the whole slew of media here to it's made national attention I mean it's
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:53.160]  been all over the news this morning I saw it you know the video that we
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:58.000]  originally posted was posted on cbc the national so it's already all over the
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.200]  news and they're all here to speak to him when he gets out and the media
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:07.720]  realizes he was arrested for a crime that did not exist the police lot about
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:12.400]  that and so now they're trying to trump up new charges so just let me get a
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.920]  brief statement from him then he can talk to the media and then we'll call
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:19.200]  you back after he's done talking to the media or perhaps you can hold the phone
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:22.840]  up during the impromptu press conference that's probably what you want to do is
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:27.520]  bring him outside and just have him have a press conference yeah well that's what
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:31.600]  they look like they're preparing to do there's a bunch of them here cameras a
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:35.400]  whole bunch of people so we're all standing by the door at the side of the
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:38.720]  courthouse you know that's why the Canadians had to let me out after 15
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:41.600]  hours when they were going to charge me with all these crimes was because we got
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:45.880]  word out to the media they want to do this in the cover of dark absolutely not
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:50.840]  to mention they didn't even let Luke Rudovsky into the country you know if he
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:57.800]  planned guilty I sure hope he didn't have you found him yet Charles no no
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:02.600]  he's still in there somebody may have given you this info telling you he's
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.680]  been leaving he's gonna be let out well there's a whole slew of media here
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:12.600]  waiting for him to get out so maybe they've decided to drop the charges it's
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:16.200]  tough to say really it's tough to say until we get well we're waiting let me
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:19.600]  ask you this we see all these different press reports now than threatening to
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:25.080]  rape women and actually sexually abusing them actually penetrating them
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:29.400]  with objects and putting fingers I mean this is incredible this really happened
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:36.120]  and this works very credible yeah Dan what's your view on that I'm sorry I was
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:41.600]  that you on the reports of threats of rape and women being penetrated yeah I
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:46.840]  briefly saw a video of that on on YouTube last night is more and more
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:50.400]  information is coming out and I'm sure we're gonna get a lot more information
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:54.560]  in the coming weeks about what actually took place in Toronto during the G20
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:58:00.240]  from the weekend but as we all know it was an absolutely unprecedented show of
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:04.960]  force the police have gone completely a group liberated the Canadian
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:10.160]  Constitution and everything that we stand for and so yeah more information is

[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:26.840]  Alex Jones all right my friends we've reached the halfway point in this
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:34.440]  transmission it is Wednesday the 30th day of June 2010 Charlie Beach journalist
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:39.560]  political activist filmmaker was arrested once the Toronto Star CBC
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:46.040]  television are reporting that it was a non-existent law the police were quoting
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:51.560]  a law saying you can't film you know you can't not give a sure ID it's a new
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:55.760]  emergency power and they arrested him and 600 others but he's the one person
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:00.080]  it's on video with them quoting the fake law it hit national news the last three
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.040]  days that it was a fake law the last two days and so they went and found videos
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:11.320]  on YouTube of him joking going yes I'm British Intel here to stage you know
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:15.440]  provocateur events so you can attack the protesters like you did two and a half
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:19.640]  years ago talking about a real case that happened and so the police have
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:23.640]  charged him even though he's saying of course I'm being absurdist and this is
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:28.960]  all you know absurdist film I'm making you know he's illustrating he'll also
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:34.720]  say I love the tyranny it's so much fun it's so good all of us we need more big
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:42.040]  brother of course I've done that from time to time as well being sarcastic
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:46.880]  we've got people at the courthouse they're having a hearing he's either
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:52.280]  gonna be charged and be allowed to leave the country or if he pleads innocent
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:56.680]  they're gonna try to keep him so as soon as he as soon as we know something it
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.880]  could happen in five minutes it could happen in 30 minutes Dan Dix is going
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:04.080]  into the hearing right now they're gonna have a press conference there's a bunch
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:09.280]  of national media there CBC CTV newspapers I mean just a giant throng he
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:13.320]  was telling us on air and then off air elaborated so he's dealing with that and
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:16.600]  we'll find out what's going on but the good news is there's the press is still
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:21.400]  reporting on this now separately multiple women including journalists are
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:25.080]  reporting that police were threatening I'll rape you they were strip searching
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:29.320]  them over and over again and that they were also putting their fingers I don't
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:34.640]  want to get into it but it constitutes rape if you use an object to do to do
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:38.960]  that I hope this isn't true but how many times we heard about cops with toilet
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:42.640]  plungers and the rest of it I mean this just shows how sadistic and evil these
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:46.400]  governments have gotten and you have snatch and grabs men in plain clothes
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:50.920]  and black vans grabbing people putting bags over their heads to terrorize the
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:55.960]  public at the G20 last year in Pittsburgh they were putting bags over
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:00.560]  people's heads Rob do witness this I mean snatching and grabbing and putting
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.720]  bags over your heads it's meant to terrorize you it's a and the police now
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:09.840]  admit the black uniforms the beating on the shields it's all a Psyop and then
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:15.440]  who are they protecting 1.2 billion the bankers the international bankers the
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:19.120]  establishment why is this going on we're gonna go to break and I'm gonna
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:24.800]  directly go to Laura Tim John Joe and others that are holding I'm going to get
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:28.240]  to John and London John and Texas and others I'm gonna go directly to your
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:32.440]  calls until about the bottom of the hour and then I'm gonna in a controlled

[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:37.400]  crazier and crazier every day every week and I said yeah he said when is it
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:41.600]  gonna slow down and I said never there's almost seven billion people in the
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:48.920]  world the elites of the planet are competing with each other a world
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:52.280]  governments being established there are more people on the internet
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:58.400]  communicating there's more news and information so both both more news is
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:01.680]  actually happening more things are happening because there's more people
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:05.640]  but also there's more people to report on what's happening so we also know more
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:09.480]  of what's going on then there's also more disinformation and then more
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:14.480]  accurate information and then more confusion it is just gonna get crazier
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:18.880]  and crazier and crazier and it's all coming at once the global banking
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:23.880]  implosion by design the attack on Iran being geared up the staged oil spill the
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:30.400]  blocking of the aid vessels the takeover of the banking system domestically and
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:35.240]  they're billing it as a reform when when even the Washington Post admitted
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:39.440]  unlimited power to the Federal Reserve six hundred trillion in derivatives they
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:43.480]  can take over any financial institution or anything that affects that's in the
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:49.280]  field the financial system I mean it's just you are dictator bankers thank you
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:55.880]  for robbing us and you've got Asia's corrupt Latin America's like Latin
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:10:00.760]  America's corrupt the Arabs are corrupt Israel's corrupt China's corrupt the
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:04.800]  Russians are corrupt I mean it's evil in high places and everything's getting
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:07.760]  more and more corrupt as other nations get more corrupt than other nations
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:13.000]  trump them with more dirty tactics and it's just the world is going to hell in
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.600]  a handbasket I know you know that and that's why good people have to get
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:21.320]  involved and and and really try to warn others and and say no to evil no to
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:28.440]  corruption and offer the alternative to a despotic evil society because things
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:32.080]  are only going to get worse before they get better historically we know that
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:36.120]  philosophically we understand that as a law of nature but we have to have that
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:41.640]  alternative built and ready and demonstrated so people understand as
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:47.880]  things get worse here's the alternative or here's a group of alternatives all
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:50.000]  right I said to go to your calls we're gonna go to them and then all the news
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.320]  it's all coming up Laura in Iowa and then John in London Laura you're on the
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:11:00.600]  air hi Alex I want to let you know that I am extremely serious about hearing
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:06.080]  about the female reporters being threatened of rape or being raped I am a
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:11.880]  highly respected high-ranking mixed martial artist I'm an old keeper I'm
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:18.120]  also a TV reporter for in-your-face television network and this is extremely
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:24.040]  disturbing news in my martial arts school there are goons coming in like the
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:28.760]  police are coming in to be trained in mixed martial arts and who do you think
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:32.880]  they're gonna use this stuff on the American people this extremely
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:38.600]  period to me I am shaking I am so mad at these people for doing to these women
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:43.840]  and the reporters beating the children well good cops should be mad too because
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:48.080]  all these videos of them tasering bedroom women and these videos of them
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:52.840]  beaten up little kids and the videos of cops raping women this is all coming out
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:12:00.240]  and and the establishment wants a war between the people and the police they
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:04.320]  want to set each other's throats we've got to somehow have these people rebuked
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:09.840]  so that we don't go into this self-fulfilling prophecy of an us against
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:15.520]  them system and I would also recommend for all your viewers listening right
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:21.360]  now to join a mixed martial arts school not a taekwondo academy not a boxing
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:26.160]  academy but a mixed martial arts because when they corner you in jail for
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:30.560]  speaking your free amendment right just have free speech and if they're
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.680]  cornering you and they say they're gonna rape you hurt you kill you that at
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:38.080]  least you have a chance to defend yourself when you're unarmed well man
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:41.760]  that's called terrorism I mean according to their definition now if a cop is
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:45.320]  raping your five-year-old daughter you're not allowed to defend yourself
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.920]  that's an act of terrorism it's an act of love by the government to rape
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:52.800]  children and women and others and I'm not joking this happened at Abu Ghraib and
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:56.080]  they call them patriots they rape children with flashlight stripping with
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:00.360]  battery acid that's in the army report the general to goomba report and I'm
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:05.480]  not kidding you can't make this stuff up and they are gonna try to protect them
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:08.800]  and sadly if you tried to defend yourself in one of the government rape
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:13.160]  rooms they would then kill you and then claim you were a terrorist look I'm
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:17.280]  look how many people are dying in TSA custody or dying in Canadian TSA custody
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:21.200]  but I do agree mixed martial arts are good because I guess it teaches you
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:27.200]  moves you know to be able to subdue people in the ground game or whatever
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:33.800]  they call it and not have to you know the problem is so many people then end up
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:38.200]  trying to rely just on their mixed martial arts instead of just
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:41.600]  explosively defending themselves but it is important to know how to punch
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:46.280]  somebody in the throat it is important to know how to mainly just get some on
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:48.520]  the ground and stomp on their head it means the quickest way to deal with
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:53.520]  somebody but I mean you can't talk about that with cops you need to teach we
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:58.080]  need to teach our daughters and our mothers and our and our wives that when
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:03.800]  the government wants to rape them to to say thank you God please rape me oh I
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:07.960]  love you no I'm being sarcastic Laura it's just that the level of government
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:14.520]  worship has gotten so sick that now it's terrorism for you to even say that you
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:19.020]  would defend yourself of an officer was trying to rape you now the common law in
[02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:22.880]  the United States says that of a cop outside of their duty and outside of
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:25.920]  their jurisdiction say tries to kill you you have a right to defend yourself
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:29.640]  and there's been a lot of cases of that but they're trying to change the
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:35.360]  perception that I see court cases every day in the news where cops are beating
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:39.080]  someone with a billy club so they raise their arm just to block the blow that is
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:43.920]  assault you are to say please break my jaw for no reason please I worship you
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:47.440]  you are my king you are my lord you are the government I appreciate your call
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:51.760]  John in London you are on the air I hope you don't talk about defending
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:55.720]  yourself I hope you don't you know say that the Jews in Germany when they were
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:58.200]  being run into pitch to be shot in the back of the head should have defended
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:04.000]  themselves of course that's what I believe but I'm a terrorist go ahead Alex
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:10.960]  can you hear me yes I can if you wrote a letter about the the New World Order
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:16.760]  and you persuaded some of your celebrity supporters to sign it surely
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:22.840]  that letter could be used to wake up middle America within days I don't know
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:25.680]  people really don't listen to what Hollywood people say and I've met a lot
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:29.200]  of Hollywood people I've been told by a lot of high-power people they admire
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:33.240]  when I'm doing what they're scared and I've had a few big Hollywood people on
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:39.800]  the show but then a lot of times they get so much heat I mean Willie Nelson came
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:43.240]  on and talked about 9-11 being an inside job and he got death threats all over
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:46.760]  the place till his family just said please will you not have him on anymore
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:51.200]  dad really likes you and and he likes coming on he'll come on of you asking
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:54.320]  but we're getting death threats and we're scared so I haven't bug Willie to
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.720]  come on in a year and a half because of the death threats Charlie Sheen got
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:01.520]  demonized and set up and lied about when he went public just even Turra's been
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:05.760]  demonized and lied about and I know a lot of other people even bigger than
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:08.640]  Willie Nelson if you can believe that bigger than Charlie Sheen there's not
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:13.240]  many bigger than Jesse Ventura that know and they're there they're not gonna go
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:17.160]  public just because I've had dinner with somebody or had a phone conversation
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:20.760]  with somebody or been at a meeting with someone and they've confided you know hey
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:24.320]  off the record I really agree with you and I know we're in danger and you know
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:27.240]  thanks for what you're doing and well and I'll say well have you ever thought
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:31.920]  about going public they just destroy me and you know you know we're working on
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:38.880]  things maybe someday so so you know I mean I can't hardly persuade my wife on
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:42.320]  what color drapes I want in the house so I mean that's not like I'm all
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:47.200]  powerful here or something but if you wrote it I'm sure that some of them
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.160]  could be persuaded to sign it and they would have safety in numbers as well
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:55.640]  wouldn't I well now that's been discussed behind the scenes and I've
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:58.680]  and I've actually tried what you're talking about and the people just
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:04.320]  chickened out and said no I was thinking it would be like Charlie Sheen's letter
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:11.440]  to the president but giving the full picture well you know Charlie Sheen
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:15.840]  is not an angel none of us are and it's because he is a maverick and an original
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:19.680]  person and the things the media talks about are exaggerated in a very small
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:23.480]  part of who he is I know him very well we're really good friends spent a lot of
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:28.120]  time with him but look at what they did to him and then he was told people
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:34.960]  involved with a production to make a movie about 9-11 were told a high-powered
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:40.160]  producer was called and told your children aren't going to be safe if you
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:44.840]  do this they were called by a military officer in fact they were called by a
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:48.880]  general and they were told your children are not safe you do this I'm just here
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:51.280]  to give you a warning I'm not threatening your kids but your kids are
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:55.880]  going to be targets and then you saw Bill O'Reilly get on the news and say
[02:17:55.880 --> 02:17:59.480]  Charlie Sheen you're not going to make it something bad is going to happen to
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:03.880]  you just like a mobster he said you understand me son you don't make this
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:09.160]  movie I mean and even other news said my god was like a mafia threat and then I
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:11.920]  said I couldn't talk about it because I was asked not to talk about it
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:17.160]  Mark Cuban separately was going to fund a theatrical release of a you know loose
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:23.320]  change big-budget film and then the FTC Federal Trade Commission called him and
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:27.440]  emailed him this came out the New York Times and said listen we're going to
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:32.720]  prosecute you if you don't drop this film and Mark Cuban did drop it he just
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:36.160]  said listen I I just put out controversial stuff and I'm not even
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:41.640]  you know I I'm not going to do this and they still indicted him this came out
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:44.400]  the New York Times a year after I couldn't talk about it I just said he was
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:49.280]  threatened there's in the New York Times and they indicted him for something
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:53.280]  like $400,000 trade which the guy's worth like $5 billion $6 billion
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:57.240]  it was nothing he didn't even was an auto trade they claimed it was insider
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:01.440]  trading I mean even when he backed off they said that matter and died him and
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:08.480]  he said I'm not going to plead guilty to this I didn't do this and so I mean
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:14.760]  Ron Paul is now being investigated by the Federal Elections Commission he says
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:18.200]  that he is being attacked and this is persecution the story is up on
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:23.400]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com I mean Ron Paul who is pure as the driven
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:28.720]  snow I mean he is as close to a saint as you can get pious work 17 hours a day
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:34.000]  he is the real McCoy and he is now under massive federal attack I haven't even
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:40.600]  gotten to that yet today I get death threats I mean I ladies and gentlemen
[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:46.040]  this isn't a game but but I understand your point John we need scientists and
[02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:50.560]  Nobel laureates and people in the establishment to get past their fear
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:54.880]  and come out they can't stop us all but they do try to destroy people so that
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:58.400]  they are scared and when they indicted Mark Cuban that sent a message through
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:06.000]  Hollywood. Global meltdowns massive unemployment endless wars a new

[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:50.720]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com if this is an attack they are totally above
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:58.000]  board all their filings are on record and they are getting donations a campaign

[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:32.480]  shut up now let's go ahead and talk to Tim and Jersey Tim you're on the air
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:38.920]  welcome hey Alex I just wanted to first say great job on the opening in Anthony
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:44.080]  show I probably I got out to a lot of people yeah they got millions of
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:48.360]  millions of listeners thank you yes it was very well done but I wanted to say
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:54.200]  I did attend CG20 summit I was able to get across the border I had to lie but
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:26:00.280]  anyway I was there Sunday and I attended the protest it was completely
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:09.400]  peaceful and I we ended up marching and we I ended up in the Queen and Spadina
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:15.880]  10 that they literally came and surrounded on all four streets and
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:22.280]  started marching in and had like in this approach pedestrians they had
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:28.760]  sentenced in for four hours in the rain with never any warning to just first
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:35.400]  luckily my friend and I we I convinced them that some of the cops on the front
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:40.800]  line I talked to them some of them were like yes we are riot police we are
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:44.480]  trained to stay here we can't do anything I'm like so you're just
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:51.760]  following orders but then luckily a cop medic in the back somehow she she
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:55.680]  stopped she we told them we were just going to a concert she was able to bring
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:00.640]  us out in the line we showed our IDs and she's like so you guys aren't
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:04.400]  professional protesters right coming from the States we're like no no she's
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:08.800]  like okay then you can leave and they came in and we're targeting people who
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:13.440]  are protesters and it was very funny well I mean there's video of them beating
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:17.520]  up little kids beating up London Guardian reporters and now the reporters are
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:21.840]  saying that they were threatening to rape them and were putting their fingers
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:25.960]  inside the women it's just unbelievable and you know what my gut tells me it's
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:30.400]  all true the the reporters that are saying this look very credible sound very
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:37.480]  credible and I mean I just can't believe there are men that are like that I
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:41.200]  mean what are men doing strip searching women to begin with in fact as you guys
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:45.600]  find that video asked for earlier woman strip search by police if you go to
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:48.200]  YouTube there's a bunch of them but there's one where she just screaming and
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:53.120]  screaming and they're just grabbing her breast and grabbing her it's extremely
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:58.480]  powerful it's extremely powerful but this is all part of the humiliation we
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:02.360]  know where this goes we know when you militarize police they then see the
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:05.800]  public as their enemy they begin waging war against us Tim I appreciate your
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:13.600]  call let's go to Joe in Texas you're on the air Joe hello Alex hey buddy hey
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:19.560]  Alex I just call sir I know the subject is on the G20 no it's on everything it's
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:24.880]  on everything well I just Alex I know how you document everything brother and I
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:30.880]  just had an article real quick that has to do on the gun sales on a gunsmith as
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:36.760]  I talked to you before but there's an article here that that just states
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:41.840]  quickly some in law enforcement's continue to fill a pinch here Dave
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:46.320]  Medlin in Overland County Texas has stated that ammunition availability
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:52.040]  continues to be a problem he says I I am still seeing ammo shortages from the
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:57.280]  retail stores in the Amarillo area and I'm having difficulty replacing my
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:02.600]  existing stock on training and duty ammo oh yeah the government's buying up
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:06.320]  mostly ammo they're not allowing foreign ammo in and there are ammo shortages
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:10.120]  everywhere and ammo is more than doubled in the last year and a half but that's
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:13.880]  the good news because it's not just the shortages from manufacturing or the
[02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:18.480]  military buying it the citizens are buying it up last time I checked 18
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:21.680]  million guns have been sold since Obama's in I'm sure it's got to be 20
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:29.920]  million by now and so what do you make of this Joe well I'm I believe exactly
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:35.640]  because the next was I've had numerous students comment to me that their
[02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:40.320]  departments have been forced to limit the amount they can order certainly of
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:43.680]  cops in Texas are complaining about ammo supply manufacturers have not
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:47.600]  completely caught up with me let's finish up John and get to the crux the way

[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:07.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:11.840]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:15.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:32:15.880 --> 02:32:19.760]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:23.840]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:28.200]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:32:28.200 --> 02:32:32.520]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:36.240]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:40.440]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:43.800]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:07.400]  that we showed you last night might not be the only video that was shot in this
[02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:12.200]  controversial case the investigator Tom Meyer has more tonight with part two of
[02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:18.000]  his exclusive investigation why did you decide to talk with me I don't want this
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:25.200]  to happen to somebody else Greg Steffi and his wife hope are suing the start
[02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:30.160]  county sheriff accusing deputies of using excessive and outrageous force an
[02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:35.560]  allegation the sheriff denies but Steffi says this video shot by deputies and
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:40.680]  obtained by channel 3 news speaks for itself
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:47.840]  this case got started with a call to 911 for help Greg's wife was injured
[02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:52.280]  when a cousin assaulted her when she had someone called the start county sheriff
[02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:58.880]  her troubles got worse a lot worse they say a deputy was confused when he
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:02.840]  arrived at the location where the attack occurred they say he began treating
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:08.960]  the injured Steffi not as the victim but as the troublemaker he proceeded to
[02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:18.200]  pick her up off the ground and slam her on to the ground
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:28.680]  women were reportedly being raped by the Toronto police that was in the news
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:35.240]  today a giant armada of US and Israeli ships was openly saying they made new
[02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:40.880]  Iran that's what I read in the news today I read in the news today that a
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:44.800]  congressional delegation is being blocked from being able to go down and see
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:48.840]  what's happening in the Gulf why don't they just ignore Obama and do what they
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:52.600]  want he can't tell them that you know the government says I have to have
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:58.640]  permission to breathe so I'm gonna stop breathing and you turn purple and die
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:02.520]  because the government said so I mean the government says I've got to pay a
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:07.240]  carbon tax to breathe they're actually doing that now so I better do it since
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:12.040]  when do we let these arrogant packs of criminals who dress in fancy suits set up
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:15.520]  there and tell us we're all scum and that where their property let's go back
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:18.920]  now to the calls because I'm about to get into a bunch of news here let's
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:23.400]  finish these calls quick Joe in Texas you're saying I guess from what you say
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:27.520]  you're training police that's the gist of what I got and that they're all
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:32.680]  telling you they're having ammo shortages go ahead yes sir and that they're
[02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:36.040]  saying it certainly the cops in Texas are forced to limp the amount they can
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:40.160]  order or rather the amount or complaining about them ammo supply
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:45.680]  manufacturers have not completely caught up to demand and I do feel like you
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:50.740]  Alex from what I've listened to you and learned and spread the word to my
[02:35:50.740 --> 02:35:56.480]  family and their friends that this is a government thing I know that Remington is
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:01.200]  still in Arkansas making ammunition in this place and that's probably what's
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:06.920]  still holding what little tiny bit of our economy's left and you know the
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:11.880]  things that are made in America still and I did the violence policy center and
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:15.480]  others have said they said we're gonna shut down the gun industry by suing them
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:19.480]  and by prosecuting them and the ammo and now Schwarzenegger got the law passed
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:25.120]  we're all guns sold in California must stamp a number on the shell casing when
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:29.560]  you pull the trigger and then that will make basically gun manufacturers won't
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:33.400]  be able to make guns because there's a very expensive patent for it that are
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:37.760]  just sold in California I mean they're destroying our Second Amendment look so
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:41.240]  to my or swore that she would uphold the Second Amendment and believe it was an
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:45.320]  individual right just a what six eight months ago and then she voted to ban
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:50.200]  guns in the ruling that came down Monday but but thank God she was overruled
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:54.920]  she called for a complete gun ban four to four to nine you know four to five out
[02:36:54.920 --> 02:37:00.360]  of the nine but in the majority decision it now says well the government can
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.960]  still restrict under law so it's not really a complete victory in fact I see
[02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:10.960]  it as an overall defeat but a very very suspicious Joe I appreciate your call I
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:16.680]  know this I mean ammo is at least double what it was in the past and I go in and
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:22.920]  try to buy regular cartridges and they don't have them at a lot of places and
[02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:28.840]  then they'll they'll be sold out at a local gun shop so I'll go to Academy and
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:32.440]  they won't have what I need so I'll what about a year ago I went ahead and went
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:37.080]  into Walmart just to see if it was true really and they wanted my name my
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:41.040]  driver's license all this stuff they were put in database and I just said you
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:49.160]  know what forget it but John in Texas you're on the air go ahead Alex hey
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:53.880]  buddy I think I think I remember I think was under Clinton I read I was reading
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:59.200]  the paper that the that the Army ammunition plants that they used to make
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:02.200]  they made the government made the ammunition for the army they were
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:06.080]  shutting them all down yes and there were a few left under Bush and then
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:11.000]  Obama shot them completely down and they don't allow us to import ammo they
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:17.520]  stopped letting the army sell its brass to reloaders big companies so that
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:22.640]  increased prices go ahead most of the ammunition I've seen that per se was
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:27.080]  all coming from Russia two to three and there was a giant stockpiles brought in
[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:30.440]  in the 80s and 90s and they may have changed the regulation but for a while
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:35.240]  Obama because it was outside of law I was just using regulations was stopping
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:40.320]  ammo and firing guns from coming in hell they're they're seizing airsoft plastic
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:46.320]  BB guns now that are coming into the west coast yeah I know you know Alex
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:50.720]  well I want one of our real what I wanted to really talk about was you know
[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:54.600]  the World War two generation is almost gone I'm I was I'm a baby boomer I was
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:59.480]  born 49 I'm 60 years old now when we're gone nobody in this country is gonna
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:02.760]  realize the freedoms we used to have they're gonna think that what's going
[02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:06.440]  on today has always been normal you know the way that the reason I'm talking
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:09.760]  about this about that kid that went to school with a toy soldiers on his hat
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:13.840]  you know and they kicked them out well when I was in elementary school in the
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:18.040]  1950s we always took toy soldiers to school we should take toy guns to school
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:21.520]  and play cowboys and Indians out on the playground we should take jackknives to
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:24.760]  school boys called jackknives and nothing was ever said my dad took his
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:28.680]  shotgun to school and he was in a pretty big rural school and put it in his
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:32.920]  locker they were they would ride on the school buses with 22s and shotguns they
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:38.520]  never had school shootings we were not a domesticated castrated population and
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:41.560]  when the United States went to war people were in deep trouble because in
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:44.360]  Europe they hadn't had guns for hundreds of years and didn't know how to use them
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:47.720]  even if they'd been trained they just weren't as good as people like Audie
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:54.040]  Murphy from Texas and that culture is dying and I mean just in New York they
[02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:58.600]  had shooting clubs in Manhattan they had shooting clubs for the young people and
[02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:04.680]  they are killing that culture they are creating domesticated slaves and they're
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:08.840]  doing a great job of it and you know the point you make I see articles every
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:15.960]  few weeks about child brings army man to school arrested child brings toy
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:19.520]  Star Wars gun it was less than two inches long remember that one a couple
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:25.000]  months ago and the new one he had an army man on his hat just you know and
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.200]  and so they were freaking out and the images the government's got all these
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:32.840]  guns their arm to the teeth that you know they can beat you kill you whenever
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:36.680]  they want but you can't even have the image of a gun and I see reports
[02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:43.240]  constantly about junior high students who will write an essay of and it'll
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:47.120]  have zombies or wars I mean I wrote those in English class and got a pluses
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:52.280]  and they arrest them even though it's a fictitious school in another country in
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:56.600]  one case with zombies and actually got an a plus for a zombie story in middle
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:00.280]  school I remember getting that and the teacher picked me out to read it before
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:03.760]  the class and thought it was a great story and because you know you could see
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:08.240]  these zombie movies on TV then you write an article about it and so it's
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:12.200]  thought crime and if you want to know how they phase it in generationally if
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:16.720]  you think what you see on TV and the culture is domesticated and enslaved
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:23.920]  John if you actually if you actually see now what's in the schools it is like
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:29.320]  the Twilight Zone 1984 any other points John yeah well when I was in that when
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:32.520]  I was in high school in the early 60s we didn't have such a thing as school
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:36.720]  police I never seen a cop in school and one time somebody sent off a cherry
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:40.400]  bomb in school you know would he be a big firecracker and they got mad about
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:43.480]  went on to intercom and said everybody caught with a firecracker be kicked out
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:46.800]  of school but they didn't call a cop they didn't call ATF and if the guy would
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:49.160]  have got caught he got kicked off for three days and then your mother and
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:51.760]  dad had to come get you back in but that was it well no he would have been
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:56.440]  probably taken out and made to run that's cruel and unusual see see they
[02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:59.960]  always restrict regular training and discipline that'll make us be upright
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:03.920]  and then once we're out of control then they totally enslave us I mean you know
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:08.480]  the the children's movie Pinocchio explains it all you know the way the
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:12.720]  system wants you to be corrupt so they can compromise you and they would have
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:18.200]  been run around the the football field until they threw up then they would have
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:21.480]  been given pops then they would have been sent home for three days and then
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:26.760]  their parents would have whooped their butt but up one more one thing before I
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:31.320]  go Alex up talking about guns I remember going to my dad to a pawn shop
[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:35.640]  back in the end of about 1959 he wanted to buy a deer rifle and he went in there
[02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:38.600]  and he picked out the gun he wanted to put the money on a counter walked out
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:42.360]  and then that was it you you could have sent for you could if you wanted your
[02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:46.120]  right for a gun you could send a check in a mail and it was a real look the
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:50.720]  Sears robot I hear you John my son's reading a book a boy in the big bear or
[02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:55.880]  something it's published 1954 and the whole thing is the six-year-old kid
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:00.040]  out hunting bears with his rifle and then he finds a baby bear and decides not
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:03.600]  to kill it and then raises it and then has trouble with it but the point is
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:08.320]  you know that that was an award-winning book it says it won the national award
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:14.120]  for schools and was put in schools nationwide in 1954 and now I mean this
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:19.200]  book is like completely alien they want us domesticated then they have select
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:24.240]  paramilitary guilds where you're allowed to be macho and allowed to be manly but
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:28.600]  it's a false distortion of a bunch of soft weaklings and commando outfits
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:33.920]  beating up women I mean I've seen these cops folks and they are pathetic I mean
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:37.600]  you they're just weak you look in their eyes a real warrior somebody who's
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:44.240]  really strong wants to fight other warriors I mean it's just totally sick
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:49.080]  it's just it's really a bunch of limp-wristed people and big fancy battle
[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:52.440]  outfits and they just love cornering a woman and beating the hell out of her
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:57.880]  and I'm not saying all police are like that you can tell it you know a cop I
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:01.360]  mean it seems like the bigger and the tougher and the meaner the cop is the
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:05.440]  nicer they are it's always these I hate to say it it's like these liberal cops
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:09.160]  they're just in women cops and I'm not saying all women cops but you know I've
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:13.520]  just I've noticed it they got something to prove they're scared they're they're
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:17.520]  cowards they're domesticated I mean if you're not really strong and you don't
[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:23.200]  want to protect people you shouldn't be a cop and if you like to abuse people you
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:28.040]  don't need to be a cop but instead they want the sicko abusers they want the
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:32.440]  people that have problems they want the people that are wimps they don't want
[02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:36.080]  people that are peacemakers that are peace officers who were negotiators I
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:40.560]  hate to use a popular culture example but was Matt Dylan out just because that's
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:44.880]  a good example of a I've actually read the histories of a good sheriff I mean
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:48.200]  it's it's a little overblown and you know he was in a lot more you know in the
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:51.520]  fictitious gun smoke than a sheriff really would be but in some cases there
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:55.440]  were some sheriffs that were in that type of action but the issue is he was
[02:44:55.440 --> 02:44:59.920]  out walking softly carrying a big stick not looking for trouble being friendly
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:03.520]  you had to negotiate with people but that if he had to be rough he would be
[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:09.560]  that's what you're supposed to have in a lawman not just some arrogant wimp who
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:14.200]  if somebody looks at him wrong or some old lady scared when ten cops stomping
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:17.560]  their house because she calls an ambulance and some old lady who's you
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:22.040]  know low on oxygen dying and feels absolutely horrible and has organs
[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:27.120]  failing you know is grumpy and and barely talks some trash to the cops so
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:33.200]  they taser her and make her go into convulsions I mean you shouldn't be a
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:37.760]  cop if you can't handle oh an old lady got smart mouth with me tasered if you
[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:42.040]  can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen here I mean it's a bunch of
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:48.520]  these are all spoiled rotten kids who mommy gave them everything and they
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:52.920]  were bullies in school and now they're a cop and everybody's got a bow down to
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:57.600]  them I'm not doing it okay I'm done I know thugs when I see it I know cowards

[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:22.000]  need to go ahead and get into all the news and I almost want to cut up these
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:27.760]  pieces I do live here on air and then give and then post it on prisonplanet.tv
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:33.400]  as vignettes you know as separate thoughts so that it's not just caught
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:38.600]  in the wider stream of calls and guests and my ramblings because the
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:43.800]  information I'm about to cover here is just of import that is so great it's
[02:46:43.800 --> 02:46:49.560]  it's it's it's it's even mind-blowing to me somebody who just constantly studies
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:55.640]  this information but let me go ahead and just just note here this is extremely
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:47:00.760]  important yeah I'm about to go through news and this is extremely extremely
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:09.000]  important information that you are about to hear dollars should be replaced as
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:14.720]  international standard UN report says and if the guys give me a document cam
[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:19.760]  shot I will show you this article for prisonplanet.tv viewers the dollar is
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:24.120]  an unreliable international currency and should be replaced by a more stable
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:29.120]  system the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs set in a
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:38.120]  report released Tuesday so this is a CIA OSS Pentagon created system in 1945 to
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:42.960]  dissolve other nations and bring them under the corporate governance and here
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:48.360]  we are 60 years later 60 plus years later and they're saying dissolve our
[02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:57.160]  currency now remember this is a creation of our traderist government the use of
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:01.000]  the dollar for international trade came under increasing scrutiny when the US
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:05.440]  economy fell into recession the dollar has proven not to be a stable store of
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:10.880]  value which is a requisite for a stable reserve currency the report said many
[02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:14.440]  countries in Asia in particular have been building up massive dollar reserves of
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:19.040]  result those countries currencies have become undervalued decreasing their
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:24.640]  ability to import goods from abroad the world economic and social survey 2010 is
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:28.280]  supporting a proposal long advocated by the international monetary fund to
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:32.440]  create a standardized international system for liquidity transfer now what
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:36.280]  is the G20 calling for what is Geithner calling for what is Goldman Sachs
[02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:40.520]  calling for what are the real corporate spies they're not Ruskies they're not
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:46.080]  Chai comms they're corporate spies and it's almost like we're Native Americans
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:50.160]  and these corporate spies are smallpox we have no immunity to them all we're
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:53.720]  all we're worried about is you know foreign enemies were in turbines and so
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:58.800]  we can't see it now decades ago the globalists said they would do this they
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:02.360]  would first destroy and to base our currency use the devaluation of it to
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:06.360]  fund their planetary regime they would then implode the dollar and create a
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:11.480]  global reserve currency owned and run by private banking consortium the elite
[02:49:11.480 --> 02:49:15.160]  banks and now they're got the financial reform act which the Washington Post
[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:21.200]  admits fully takes over our banks that is real banks down the street from you
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:24.960]  as the Texas banking association said two months ago this is a global
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:29.840]  corporate banking takeover of real banks that is taking place right now so it's
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:34.120]  a global consolidation and as they called for at the Copenhagen tree last
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:38.400]  year for the environment they wanted an SDR and global carbon tax now for the
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:44.040]  oil spill they want the carbon tax for every reason under the sun they need
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:48.800]  this they say and they go on to say under this proposal countries would no
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:54.160]  longer have to buy up foreign currencies they would simply have special
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:50:00.960]  drawing rights or SDRs from the IMF and World Bank and it would be a basket of
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:05.320]  currencies so so what that means is the yen the yon the euro the dollar they
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:11.160]  will all be pegged and set to whatever level that the private central banks
[02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:14.800]  tell them to be it so they won't be a unified value this will allow the
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:19.120]  mega banks to also currency speculate however they want insider trade however
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:22.520]  they want their main shareholder being Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:28.920]  globally that's the top two and always behind every new evil whether it's oil
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:32.360]  spills or banker bailouts or selling people derivatives they know we're
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:38.080]  gonna implode we come back I'm gonna finish up with this key news because
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:45.160]  here they are now here they are out in the open global governance SDRs the end
[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:50.520]  of the dollar the dollar is not good the very banks that took over our country
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:56.040]  and get this to the dollar are now saying oh it's not reliable we've got a new

[02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:24.280]  corporate government for the administrative convenience of
[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:30.340]  international bankers that's a quote by David Rockefeller in his memoirs New
[02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:37.680]  York Times he's made similar statements so out in the open they got our country
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:43.160]  and debt they had a private fellow reserve takeover for every dollar you
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:47.800]  use or get paid at your job debt is created for there to just be a dollar

[02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:58.160]  they've destroyed our system through that they consolidate power we eat the
[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:02.160]  Ponzi scheme we pay the tens of trillions of dollars the Greeks lose
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:07.360]  their islands the Greeks lose their roads we lose our infrastructure our
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:13.160]  ports our taxes go up and then now the banker has created a new bubble that is
[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:20.360]  sdr's above the nation-state and you will pay carbon taxes on everything you do
[02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:25.200]  to directly to private banks they are now even above the nations that they're
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:30.880]  dissolving now that is high treason that is who this country's threatened by
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:34.960]  that's who sold us out to China and use China to deindustrialize this country
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:40.520]  this is the group that has set up the SPP trying to get rid of our borders the
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:43.760]  group that got rid of Europe's borders and got rid of their due process and
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:53.400]  their sovereignty it's amazing this is a private corporate hostile takeover of
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:56:03.040]  America and then meanwhile the news is leaving our borders wide open but the
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:06.960]  top story is 11 Russian spies that were so deadly they could have brought down
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:13.640]  America of course Russia has spies of course their spies and it's important
[02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:20.440]  that they be exposed but this is the top news story that Russia reportedly had
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:25.640]  11 spies in this country when we have corporations that are foreign that
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:29.160]  openly called for world government that openly are establishing a world
[02:56:29.160 --> 02:56:33.240]  banking structure that we will pay taxes to that have bought off our politicians
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:38.720]  and give them campaign contributions in plain view foreign corporate spies that
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:44.960]  own and run banks bigger than any one government through fraud they've gotten
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:50.880]  this power and they are there making cash payments to the president and the
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:56.040]  members of Congress and not telling Congress when Congress asked over and
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:57:00.080]  over again where are the trillions of dollars the congressman asked the head
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:03.240]  of the Fed the head of the Treasury the head of the New York Fed and they say
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:10.320]  I'm not going to tell you and now under the reform they announced that oh this
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:13.680]  will this will fix the big bankers that did all of this and that set up the
[02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:17.720]  derivatives the very Federal Reserve that represents these elite banks it will
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:22.760]  now have unlimited power in financial regulation over anything that affects the
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:29.280]  economy I mean that's in the Washington Post I read the bill that's my
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:33.560]  analysis that's judge Andrew Napolitano's analysis that's Ron Paul's analysis but
[02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:37.560]  here's the Washington Post admitting it oh we'll show the bankers we'll give them
[02:57:37.560 --> 02:57:41.480]  a world government to punish them and we'll pay taxes directly to them and
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:44.880]  we'll give them power over all the other financial institutions so they can
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:50.200]  consolidate them that will sure show them and when they come into Toronto the
[02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:55.600]  police will ban free speech with no law snatch and grab children off the
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:58:02.040]  streets and women and threaten to rape women and rape women oh is I mean I
[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:06.040]  mean this is actually happening this is what's really going on I'm gonna come

[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:17.160]  investigate Ron Paul and his organizations I mean this is a charity
[02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:22.560]  they may try to lock Ron Paul in prison they may grab me and slam my butt in
[02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:27.380]  prison I mean the this is a hardcore takeover by these people this isn't a

[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:55.120]  their top ring leaders just a bunch of Ken lay made offs and I guess they're
[03:00:55.120 --> 03:00:58.480]  going to take everything over just because we're idiots dollars should be
[03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:03.680]  replaced as international standard UN report says a SDR run by the IMF and
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:08.400]  World Bank and again we will pay a tax to it to fund the operation that's
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:11.200]  singing in here's another one New York Times now admitting we're in a
[03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:18.160]  depression the third depression here's one of the London Telegraph RBS tells
[03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:22.160]  clients prepare for monster money printing by the Federal Reserve before
[03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:25.480]  they get rid of the dollar you'll still have it kind of like they have you know
[03:01:25.480 --> 03:01:31.280]  currency and Zimbabwe or the peso in Mexico and this is a plan they do this
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:34.600]  over and over again in other countries they're going to totally run up the
[03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:41.800]  dollar and totally inflate it destroying all your savings it's over if we let them
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:46.320]  complete this operation I mean they are they are hacking America up America's
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:50.040]  already got machete wounds all over it blood just spilling out and we might be
[03:01:50.040 --> 03:01:54.480]  able to save the country maybe but you know what it feels too good to go down
[03:01:54.480 --> 03:01:58.680]  doesn't it there's kind of a deep-seated sickness in America we killed 50 million
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:04.040]  babies and the average subconscious mind is so powerful it wants to die the
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:08.080]  average American wants to fail and just wants to wallow into maggots and just
[03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:12.240]  and just implode I mean I mean consciously people don't want that but
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:16.240]  but subconsciously there's a self-loathing a self-hate kind of like
[03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:19.800]  people want to fail they you know they don't have a stand-up and fight
[03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:24.520]  attitude anymore a large portion of the public now if any of you want to save
[03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:28.800]  your families and save the society and not go into pure bondage we have to
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:33.360]  ignore the 30 40 percent that just love tyranny and we have to ignore the other
[03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:37.040]  30 percent or so that suck their thumbs and the other 30 percent of us that
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:40.560]  know what's going on we're just gonna have to stand up be leaders and take the
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:48.480]  society back but RBS tells clients to prepare for monster money printing by
[03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:54.760]  the Federal Reserve as recovery starts to stall in the U.S. and Europe with
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:03:00.240]  echoes of the mid-1931 bond experts are once again dusting off a speech by
[03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:03.240]  Ben Bernanke giving eight years ago as a freshman governor of the Federal
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:09.680]  Reserve where he talked about how they'd hyperinflate the dollar now you
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:12.280]  noticed two years ago when they were getting ready for the banker bailout
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:17.080]  banker takeover I told you that by 2002 the stimulus would run out that that
[03:03:17.080 --> 03:03:20.240]  was really a wealth transfer to the central banks and that it would only
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:24.640]  make things worse and now we're here and that they were lying about the
[03:03:24.640 --> 03:03:28.760]  unemployment numbers and lying about inflation and now that they've suckered
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:34.080]  you good they're they're getting ready to sucker you again and say oh we've got
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:40.200]  a reform package oh but senator bird died he was the vote we needed oh don't
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:43.560]  worry and they're all over the news will the banks get punished for what they
[03:03:43.560 --> 03:03:49.560]  did the American people demand they've got all these housewives and you know
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:54.640]  six-pack guys on the news what do you think mr. mr. Johnson mr. Jones what do
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:59.720]  you think mr. Brown well I tell you I just want these banks be brought to
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:03.560]  justice it's not fair and I'm glad Obama's in there about to bring these
[03:04:03.560 --> 03:04:07.920]  banks to justice with this new bank tax and that he's gonna get the Federal
[03:04:07.920 --> 03:04:10.480]  Reserve in there the federal government federal service not the federal
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:14.720]  government but in there to to take action against these banks after what they
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:18.360]  did and they cut back to Anderson Cooper yeah it is good to see something
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:25.960]  being done Anderson admittedly CIA Cooper I mean but the good news is he's
[03:04:25.960 --> 03:04:30.200]  globalist are running out of gas yeah they're in control but they're revealing
[03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:33.720]  themselves in the take-up and they're losing all their viewers and all their
[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:39.680]  credibility I mean that Washington Post article last Friday that I've covered
[03:04:39.680 --> 03:04:44.160]  so much here where it said yeah it's 600 trillion in derivatives and yeah the
[03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:47.800]  Federal Reserve is gonna be given total power over everything that'll teach the
[03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:54.040]  banks I mean it's like saying we're gonna let Hitler in 1935 just be planetary
[03:04:54.040 --> 03:04:58.520]  ruler and that'll keep you under control we're gonna fix the illegal alien

[03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:06.280]  Genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[03:08:06.280 --> 03:08:23.400]  because there's a war on for your mind is a political article where members of
[03:08:23.400 --> 03:08:27.840]  Congress Republican members are not allowed to go to the gulf and look at
[03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:35.280]  the damage and the Democrats are allowed to enter having paid trips oil spill
[03:08:35.280 --> 03:08:40.200]  visits get partisan and they are not allowed to go visit so not only are the
[03:08:40.200 --> 03:08:44.760]  citizens not allowed to go visit but everybody else is not allowed to visit
[03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:50.440]  and you've got international waters out there Taiwanese Dutch Norwegian others
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:56.800]  one Taiwanese ship can scoop up 500,000 barrels a day that that is an
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:01.120]  incredible number that's the Associated Press reporting that and Obama is still
[03:09:01.120 --> 03:09:04.000]  blocking it but now because the pressure is so high they're seeing these
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:07.960]  hurricanes are going to blow all this oil in why won't you why for 70 plus days
[03:09:07.960 --> 03:09:11.560]  have you been blocking countries from helping you want this to be worse you
[03:09:11.560 --> 03:09:15.560]  get your carbon tax he's saying okay in the next month I'm gonna have lawyers
[03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:18.520]  look at it and if these companies can jump through all these hoops that are
[03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:23.120]  impossible then I'll let foreign governments do this they've agreed to
[03:09:23.120 --> 03:09:26.920]  let 12 foreign governments or corporations help but BP is in
[03:09:26.920 --> 03:09:30.760]  international waters why is BP in international waters then on our
[03:09:30.760 --> 03:09:37.000]  shores telling media and governors and Congress people what they can do why is
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:42.440]  BP controlling the medical care people are supposedly getting why is BP telling
[03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:45.480]  their employees and conductors they can't wear masks just like the
[03:09:45.480 --> 03:09:49.440]  firefighters and police were told you can't wear masks because the 9-11 dust
[03:09:49.440 --> 03:09:54.280]  is not bad for you and if you do wear that we'll have to admit it's bad so
[03:09:54.280 --> 03:09:58.080]  just go ahead and breathe it and die later and we're not gonna fund you by
[03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:03.920]  the way you schmuck you chump I mean these corporate people know we're
[03:10:03.920 --> 03:10:08.840]  gullible they know we're sedate they know we lay down and follow orders and
[03:10:08.840 --> 03:10:14.960]  that's a recipe for enslavement a recipe for ruination so it's time my
[03:10:14.960 --> 03:10:18.520]  friends it's time to start getting angry it's time to start getting serious
[03:10:18.520 --> 03:10:23.960]  look at this Hurricane Alex churns towards Mexico Texas coast they thought
[03:10:23.960 --> 03:10:29.440]  it was gonna turn more towards central Mexico which is bad for them but good
[03:10:29.440 --> 03:10:36.440]  for the Gulf states because then that wouldn't create too many waves but now
[03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:40.200]  because it's turned up towards Texas and it is creating six to ten foot
[03:10:40.200 --> 03:10:47.240]  swells the the bullies are showing and the NOAA is reporting the National Weather
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:52.360]  Association and it's blowing huge swells in and that oil is accelerating
[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:56.520]  because most of the oil is out to sea it's now accelerating towards Louisiana
[03:10:56.520 --> 03:11:01.800]  Mississippi and Florida and then if a hurricane comes in later more from the
[03:11:01.800 --> 03:11:05.600]  east towards Texas it's gonna blow it into Texas and Mexico but right now
[03:11:05.600 --> 03:11:09.560]  it's coming up towards the Texas Mexico border became a hurricane overnight and
[03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:15.920]  is is is blowing it more towards where the currents are going but it keeps
[03:11:15.920 --> 03:11:19.600]  leaking it keeps leaking it keeps leaking and and Obama just says it could
[03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:24.800]  be years this is a new way of life but if you'll let him pass a carbon tax then
[03:11:24.800 --> 03:11:30.640]  he might let the ships in just like he told Senator Kyle if you'll pass amnesty
[03:11:30.640 --> 03:11:34.960]  then I might secure the border but I've got to keep that border violent so I can
[03:11:34.960 --> 03:11:39.440]  lie to the public and tell them that amnesty will fix it when there's still
[03:11:39.440 --> 03:11:42.720]  be narcotics being brought in so hurricane Alex turns towards the Gulf of
[03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:48.080]  Mexico Rick Perry declared state of emergency in Texas so I'm bracing here
[03:11:48.080 --> 03:11:53.240]  in Austin for the I've looked at the science especially the dispersant and
[03:11:53.240 --> 03:11:57.920]  then the off-gassing chemicals that are released from oil yes oil doesn't get
[03:11:57.920 --> 03:12:01.920]  picked up and mixed with water and go into the atmosphere but the by-products
[03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:08.000]  and the benzene and the heavy metals can get mixed with water that's why you
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:12.200]  can have muddy rain that's why you can have fish rain or toads rain when a
[03:12:12.200 --> 03:12:20.400]  tornado a waterspout a tornado in the ocean or a lake sucks them up I've
[03:12:20.400 --> 03:12:25.320]  seen I grew up in Dallas and look out at Lake Ray Hubbard and you'd see tornadoes
[03:12:25.320 --> 03:12:28.680]  on on you know tearing up houses and tearing only saw this a few times it's
[03:12:28.680 --> 03:12:31.840]  incredibly beautiful but also devastating and you see them tearing up
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:36.280]  houses tearing up trees and the tornado be brown full of junk and dirt then it
[03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:38.880]  would hit Lake Ray Hubbard I'd be watching this from our house on the hill
[03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:44.440]  looking down and it would hit and they turn into water spouts and turn blue they
[03:12:44.440 --> 03:12:49.880]  would be brown and or black full of you know leaves and dirt and grass and parts
[03:12:49.880 --> 03:12:53.320]  of buildings and then they just come across from raw lead I was in rock wall
[03:12:53.320 --> 03:12:58.640]  watching and those and those tornadoes would hit and they just turn blue they
[03:12:58.640 --> 03:13:03.360]  turn blue as they sucked up the water I'm not saying the houses being destroyed
[03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:09.480]  was beautiful but the waterspouts were beautiful it's the same thing and it's
[03:13:09.480 --> 03:13:14.160]  not just that waterspouts are all over the Gulf I mean I've been on a cruise in
[03:13:14.160 --> 03:13:17.920]  the Gulf and seen waterspouts one after the other and stood on the deck of the
[03:13:17.920 --> 03:13:21.880]  ship as they came over us they weren't the torn attic type they were the
[03:13:21.880 --> 03:13:26.200]  smaller waterspouts but seeing now I'm digressing off into meteorology and
[03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:35.400]  earth changes the issue here is that yes the byproducts in the toxic chemicals
[03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:43.880]  and the dispersants they're using in fact Google the amount of dispersant
[03:13:43.880 --> 03:13:48.440]  using the Gulf because I keep getting my numbers crossed it's like I said that
[03:13:48.440 --> 03:13:53.360]  Taiwanese trawler did 50,000 barrels but it was 500,000 barrels the mine just
[03:13:53.360 --> 03:14:02.120]  can't get around this stuff and I want to say they said 200,000 gallons of this
[03:14:02.120 --> 03:14:06.640]  had been used of the super deadly dispersant they've got planes flying
[03:14:06.640 --> 03:14:11.040]  over spraying it and I looked up that dispersant and and did some research and
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:15.120]  it is true that that dispersant goes right up into the rain so I'm looking
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:18.880]  forward I guess to all the dispersant well Louisiana Mississippi is already
[03:14:18.880 --> 03:14:24.520]  enjoying dispersant raining down on them and now the Washington Post now the EPA
[03:14:24.520 --> 03:14:28.840]  is talking about Gulf evacuations they're not saying how big so this is
[03:14:28.840 --> 03:14:31.920]  going from bad to worse
[03:14:32.640 --> 03:14:39.840]  Hurricane Alex churns towards Mexico Texas coast and they knew they could have
[03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:43.720]  gone in with those big ships and scooped up almost all the oil they've really
[03:14:43.720 --> 03:14:46.400]  developed the science since then but since they blocked it and used a
[03:14:46.400 --> 03:14:50.600]  dispersant instead it's going to be a bigger disaster and may be cataclysmic
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:55.680]  or the response to it may be cataclysmic the martial law they're gearing up for
[03:14:55.680 --> 03:15:01.560]  Hurricane Alex churns towards Mexico Texas coast BP access to medical care
[03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:06.120]  controls access to medical care for Gulf oil cleanup workers denying that they're
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:10.480]  sick and that's what they always do a bunch of them have died hundreds and
[03:15:10.480 --> 03:15:13.760]  hundreds are in the hospital medical doctors are saying their lungs are full
[03:15:13.760 --> 03:15:18.400]  of toxic chemicals they're going into cardiac arrest
[03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:27.520]  all right from the deep water horizons it says that surface
[03:15:27.520 --> 03:15:34.120]  dispersement used it's always worse than I say 1.3 million gallons of that deadly
[03:15:34.120 --> 03:15:40.960]  chemical 1.3 million gallons that's from the Associated Press that's directly
[03:15:40.960 --> 03:15:47.920]  from the BP's own site and another type that they're using subsea they're
[03:15:47.920 --> 03:15:58.120]  putting into the ocean 576,000 gallons total dispersant used 1,606,000
[03:15:58.120 --> 03:16:06.200]  gallons holy mackerel I mean let the crude oil come in and let the states
[03:16:06.200 --> 03:16:10.720]  clean it up let the ships come in and get it before it comes in don't
[03:16:10.720 --> 03:16:17.400]  spray 1.6 million gallons of stuff that'll literally eat the skin off your
[03:16:17.400 --> 03:16:21.880]  body that they're reporting that stuff is eating boats it's so strong that's in
[03:16:21.880 --> 03:16:27.640]  mainstream news that it's eating the boats you know what I'm gonna be honest
[03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:30.520]  with you I'm not having my kids breathing this and if this stuff blows into
[03:16:30.520 --> 03:16:38.600]  Austin I'm gonna have to go I'm gonna have to go to Montana or something what
[03:16:38.600 --> 03:16:43.000]  happens if 20 million people are evacuated I mean they had a less than a
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:47.040]  300,000 or so evacuated out of New Orleans and Austin was a circus
[03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:51.800]  Houston was a circus almost bankrupted the city's paying for it what is gonna
[03:16:51.800 --> 03:16:57.360]  happen here I can't believe that terrorist Obama has done this and I've
[03:16:57.360 --> 03:17:00.760]  been calling the terrorists for two weeks on record calling for criminal
[03:17:00.760 --> 03:17:05.600]  indictments blocking the states and counties and cities and blocking
[03:17:05.600 --> 03:17:09.040]  international aid and many others are saying that so now he's saying well I'll
[03:17:09.040 --> 03:17:12.840]  look I'm gonna let the lawyers start building a plan that'll take a month or
[03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:18.240]  so maybe by then more hurricanes will come in I mean this guy is a terrorist
[03:17:18.240 --> 03:17:23.280]  and let me tell you something gentle and bar bar barber and all those other
[03:17:23.280 --> 03:17:28.000]  governors and crest that's a cop out saying the feds say we can't put berms
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:32.480]  up the feds say hey you have a responsibility when treason's going on
[03:17:32.480 --> 03:17:36.680]  and the feds have no jurisdiction on your state ground and in those estuaries
[03:17:36.680 --> 03:17:41.080]  you go out there and you tell that Coast Guard get out of your way I mean it's
[03:17:41.080 --> 03:17:45.440]  like anybody in a uniform is now God as long as that illegal alien Barry
[03:17:45.440 --> 03:17:54.560]  sataro tells them so this is definitely a false flag there is no doubt it's a
[03:17:54.560 --> 03:17:59.320]  false flag against America to bankrupt us to have a big distraction going into
[03:17:59.320 --> 03:18:03.120]  the election this morning I woke up at like 3 30 a.m. it just hit me I said of
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:06.960]  course it's not just a smoke screen for the Iran attack it's not just a smoke
[03:18:06.960 --> 03:18:11.560]  screen to get the carbon tax through in a pretext it's also for the elections
[03:18:11.560 --> 03:18:15.640]  where it's gonna be so insane building up into November that people won't
[03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:19.280]  remember government health care takeover they won't remember the gun grabbing
[03:18:19.280 --> 03:18:23.520]  they won't remember all the lies all the torture it'll just be complete
[03:18:23.520 --> 03:18:29.400]  bedlam if this continues I mean if they let let's search the latest total oil
[03:18:29.400 --> 03:18:33.280]  spill total oil in the Gulf they keep lying about it so it's always worse
[03:18:33.280 --> 03:18:38.160]  than what they say Charlie Beach is supposed to get out soon he says
[03:18:38.160 --> 03:18:41.400]  gonna give us the exclusive first report we also got Chuck Baldwin scheduled on
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:46.720]  the Ron Paul persecution that's now going on I mean look without everybody's

[03:26:14.560 --> 03:26:21.320]  run, world government SDR, where the banks make the profits and we pay taxes to them.
[03:26:21.320 --> 03:26:30.480]  That's CNN today, today, CNN, dollar should replace its international standard, UN report
[03:26:30.480 --> 03:26:33.560]  says by SDRs and it's the whole carbon tax plan.
[03:26:33.560 --> 03:26:39.840]  Now is that treason, is that espionage, Hitler couldn't conquer, Stalin, you know, Napoleon,
[03:26:39.840 --> 03:26:44.960]  whoever couldn't conquer England, couldn't conquer America, but now we're conquered by
[03:26:44.960 --> 03:26:51.720]  these private bankers who have screwed everything up by design and gotten us deep in debt building
[03:26:51.720 --> 03:26:55.720]  their empire and now they say don't worry we got a plan, we're going to take over even
[03:26:55.720 --> 03:27:04.040]  more and meanwhile look out, Iran wants to nuke him, look out, there's Muslim terrorists
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:08.000]  everywhere, meanwhile the illegal aliens are pouring across, there's thousands dead, Obama
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:12.560]  says, you know, that he's going to leave the border open so that people get terrorized
[03:27:12.560 --> 03:27:18.880]  and accepting amnesty and meanwhile the media's, oh my God, the beautiful redhead was a Russian
[03:27:18.880 --> 03:27:27.000]  spy, deep cover, oh my gosh, they were surveilling us, they were actually spies, 11 of them,
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:33.120]  what do you expect, the Chinese back under Clinton had over 3,000 front companies, Laurel,
[03:27:33.120 --> 03:27:38.200]  Hughes, missile secrets, communist, Chinese generals in the White House, commerce secretary
[03:27:38.200 --> 03:27:43.200]  was going to go public, Ron Brown, they murdered him, Air Force Colonel who did the autopsy,
[03:27:43.200 --> 03:27:46.640]  said everybody on board, been shot in the head, they had special forces on board, shoot
[03:27:46.640 --> 03:27:53.080]  everybody, blow the door, high low, he low, out of there, classic tactic, but side issue,
[03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:58.240]  you've got spies running all over America, America is a giant joke, wide open to British,
[03:27:58.240 --> 03:28:04.480]  Israeli, Chinese spies and anybody else, why is Russia the one group that when they have
[03:28:04.480 --> 03:28:10.320]  spies the globalists go ape, because the globalists made a deal, they put Lenin in, Stalin went
[03:28:10.320 --> 03:28:16.360]  sideways, they made deals later, but the Soviet Union was set up by US and British intelligence
[03:28:16.360 --> 03:28:20.800]  and that's now been declassified, Mao was put in, Mao continued the deal, the Chinese
[03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:24.600]  have never broken their deal with the bankers, when I say the US, I mean the bankers that
[03:28:24.600 --> 03:28:29.240]  hijacked us, Russia has broken those deals and Russia is involved in all sorts of evil
[03:28:29.240 --> 03:28:33.880]  as well, any big government is, that's the problem, but the point is, they're getting
[03:28:33.880 --> 03:28:38.000]  ready to attack Iran, they know Russia's been selling them weapons, they already started
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:41.920]  888 with the Russians and tried to start World War III, that's now been declassified, that's
[03:28:41.920 --> 03:28:46.480]  been major newspapers the last two months and so they're just, this is a way to kick
[03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:52.480]  off, oh my gosh, the Ruskies and notice they've got Angelino Joe Lee who's a CFR member coming
[03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:57.880]  out with that new movie, I've seen it in movies, what's it called, Salt and she's supposedly
[03:28:57.880 --> 03:29:02.040]  a government agent but they have a Russian defector and he goes, I know who the spy is,
[03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:07.640]  it's you and then she pulls off her wig and she's the sexy Russian, just like they had
[03:29:07.640 --> 03:29:12.840]  all these sneak attack movies where America sneak attacked on TV and in the theaters right
[03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:20.800]  before 9-11, I mean they made that movie to kick off the new Cold War, that's it, I mean
[03:29:20.800 --> 03:29:27.600]  period and you know I made the point of prosecute these spies and obviously they're spies, husband
[03:29:27.600 --> 03:29:34.440]  and wife teams with fake names, yeah, they're spies, folks, the Iranians have guaranteed
[03:29:34.440 --> 03:29:39.200]  got sleeper cells here in the U.S. that the globalists won't have the stage terror attacks
[03:29:39.200 --> 03:29:44.680]  when they attack them, Iran will strike back and then that's what the globalists want just
[03:29:44.680 --> 03:29:49.360]  like they blew the oil well and are blocking the recovery, they want the Iranians to attack
[03:29:49.360 --> 03:29:56.360]  so they can take your rights, we're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones
[03:29:56.360 --> 03:30:03.640]  and the GCN radio network, this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[03:30:03.640 --> 03:30:08.360]  buying a solar power generator, number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[03:30:08.360 --> 03:30:12.760]  or triple your electric bill, number two, our new energies are wants to control how
[03:30:12.760 --> 03:30:17.440]  much power your electric company allows you to have, it's true, total government control
[03:30:17.440 --> 03:30:22.320]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming, number three, in some
[03:30:22.320 --> 03:30:27.800]  areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[03:30:27.800 --> 03:30:32.280]  is only compounding the problem, number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[03:30:32.280 --> 03:30:36.920]  grids, every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages, number
[03:30:36.920 --> 03:30:41.840]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind, folks
[03:30:41.840 --> 03:30:45.480]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[03:30:45.480 --> 03:30:52.760]  my old sponsors, you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com,

[03:33:13.800 --> 03:33:42.800]  we've only got about 27 minutes left in worldwide broadcast, i may have to go into overdrive which will be internet infowars.com and prismplanet.tv streams only, im charlie veitch is scheduled to get out of the toronto prison, he was arrested a second time, big international scandal, huge news across canada, they charged him with a crime that didn't exist and the police chief lied and said there was a crime of videotaping
[03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:50.800]  and being within 5 meters of a security fence and then they went ahead and arrested him at the airport for something else to cover their hind ends
[03:33:50.800 --> 03:33:59.800]  they're going after ron paul and chuck baldwin's here to talk about it, this is up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com, we'll throw that up on screen right now
[03:33:59.800 --> 03:34:14.800]  fec federal elections commission attempts to shut down campaign for liberty and ron paul's own words, this is a direct attack, they have been extremely transparent, it is a political pack like c pack or a pack or any of the other packs
[03:34:14.800 --> 03:34:29.800]  and the republicans can have packs, israel can have packs, the british can have packs, bp can have a packed, political action committee, anybody can have it, general electric can have one, but you can't have one
[03:34:29.800 --> 03:34:45.800]  you, a true american, you who wants the bill of rights and constitution restored, this is an unprecedented attack, we're going to cover that here in just a moment, we got ron paul already scheduled tomorrow, so this will be perfect timing with him on with us in the last 30 minutes as chuck baldwin
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:35:07.800]  of course the constitution party candidate for president in 2008 just did a fabulous job, demonized by the mic report as a terrorist, as ron paul was and bob bar, but before we go to him, not only is buying the books and videos something that's going to wake people up that you can give others to truly inform them
[03:35:07.800 --> 03:35:23.800]  but it's also how we fund our operation here, and i can think of no more important books than things like the secret team by fletcher prouty, the cia and its allies and control the united states and the world, by fletcher prouty, head of pentagon black ops, how they fund the communists, how they run the whole show
[03:35:23.800 --> 03:35:41.800]  genetic roulette detailing how gmo food is meant to sterilize you, it reduces fertility of all sterilizes some so that everybody doesn't notice it right at once and takes years to do it and it covers a lot more than just that from all the government's own admissions, this book is vital for anyone out there
[03:35:41.800 --> 03:35:58.800]  you got a doctor friend or a doctor in the family who's denying this or nutritionist, just give them this book available at info wars.com, the obama deception and fall the republic, the two preeminent films, obama deception is about to rival loose change for more views online, it's just devastating
[03:35:58.800 --> 03:36:13.800]  well over 60 million views online for free, but i'm challenging you to buy it in the high quality on dvd and make copies and get it out to everybody, part two of that fall the republic, invisible empire in order to find, we've got discounts where you can get these films as low as $5.95 apiece
[03:36:13.800 --> 03:36:31.800]  don't tread on me, rise to the republic with so many great people, richard mack, michael bachneric, rj harris, synthia davis, so many others, that's how to take the states back and when this book sells out i'm going to still carry it when i order it again but not with the special
[03:36:31.800 --> 03:36:52.800]  get a free film of your choice at info wars.com when you order it and again this is all how you also fund the radio show, the news websites, everything we do, you can watch all my films and a lot more at prisonplanet.tv and i want to thank all the prisonplanet.tv members that make it possible
[03:36:52.800 --> 03:37:08.800]  you can also call toll free to get the films, the books, the materials, be sure to ask about the specials and free videos and combos we have when you call 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or PO box 19549, austin texas 78760
[03:37:08.800 --> 03:37:31.800]  alright, without further ado, i want to put back up on screen for people, we've all got to stand together or hang separate as the founding fathers said over and over again and this is a very strongly worded letter from ron paul who normally, even if he's talking about an incredibly dangerous situation like war with iran, chooses his words very carefully
[03:37:31.800 --> 03:37:39.800]  but he says this is meritless but could seriously disrupt their growing program to take america back
[03:37:39.800 --> 03:37:51.800]  they go on in the letter by congressman ron paul to say they are attacking us because we are succeeding in changing washington and they are attacking us and attack us they have
[03:37:51.800 --> 03:38:09.800]  let me give this letter today not to scare you or to cry wolf, i'm writing you to let you know that our success and its price, ladies and gentlemen, the big central banks can engage in robberies publicly, they can launder drug money, the marines can publicly be ordered to grow the opium in afghanistan which they don't like doing
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:27.800]  evil is right out in the open now, but obama can try to appoint a lady who's anti-gun, anti-free speech, he can have all of his major czars calling for shutting down freedom on the internet, she can write thesis about socialist revolutions and how beautiful they are and how she can make them succeed
[03:38:27.800 --> 03:38:46.800]  these people, everything they are doing is treason and criminal, and i don't just use that term, there is no other word, this is a group of violent revolutionaries like linen and trotsky, we are in as great a danger now as the people of russia were in 1916 or the people of germany in 1933
[03:38:46.800 --> 03:38:58.800]  i'm not kidding, they already want to arrest ron paul, my self chuck ballwin, their brainwashing cops about us, and i want to go to chuck ballwin now, i appreciate him holding on over this, this is unprecedented chuck, what's your take on it?
[03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:21.800]  well i just became aware of it today, as a matter of fact, and the letter i'm talking about, i think the rally was written by john tate who heads up ron's campaign for liberty, and you're right, this is unprecedented, i can't imagine that they would have used this kind of action against any of the groups that you just mentioned in your monologue there
[03:39:21.800 --> 03:39:34.800]  it's obviously a politically motivated, scandalous kind of activity that's being performed by the obama administration here
[03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:58.800]  well, we can't just sit here and let these crooks try to persecute ron paul, we as citizens are allowed to form a political movement within the republican party to try to elect members of congress and mayors and senators and governors that will just support the bill of rights and constitution
[03:39:58.800 --> 03:40:06.800]  but these revolutionary terrorists, they know we're trying to save america and trying to stop their revolution, and so they're coming for us
[03:40:06.800 --> 03:40:22.800]  the thing that they're going after, and this is what i think the listeners need to understand, what they're going after is shining the light on the voting records and the records of others, the bureaucrats in washington dc, and that's what campaign for liberty does
[03:40:22.800 --> 03:40:39.800]  they're excellent about informing the american people as to who supports what, or who opposes what, whatever the case may be, keeping people informed as to what the representatives and senators are doing, and i think that's what has really energized the ire of the obama administration
[03:40:39.800 --> 03:40:54.800]  well, you're right, they have auto calls that are better than anybody's, they've got auto emails, they've got people that call you, and they're really helping to feed a lot of legislation that's anti-american and globalist, you're right, and they can also look at the graph
[03:40:54.800 --> 03:41:14.800]  they just see the patriot movement, with the ron paul being one of the centerpieces of the jewel in the crown, energizing, they can see our growth curve, and that's what cast sunstein says, he says we've got to shut the web down, we've got to shut down these conspiracy theorists, these people that don't believe in global warming, these people that believe in a new world order, these people that believe in a global government
[03:41:14.800 --> 03:41:24.800]  i mean, that's in CNN today, a global government with SDRs, they can't allow us to have any speech because we've got the truth
[03:41:24.800 --> 03:41:45.800]  i think that's exactly right, and i think alex what you have said there i think is exactly the thinking that's behind it, also taking into account the disclosac that just passed the house of representatives, which unfortunately the NRA even refused to oppose because they got an exemption
[03:41:45.800 --> 03:42:10.800]  so you get an exemption if you are somebody like the NRA and a few other select particular lobbying groups, but everybody else, like G.O.A., which i really think is the greatest proponent for the second amendment today, as far as political action groups are concerned, and i'm very proud of those guys, everyone else will be not allowed to put up the voting records
[03:42:10.800 --> 03:42:17.800]  and to challenge the incumbents on their records within i think it's 120 days before elections
[03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:36.800]  now let's think about that, they're saying that American citizens and organizations cannot tell the public a voting record, think of how Twilight Zone, all of this is getting, i mean they know what they're doing is unpopular and illegal and unconstitutional
[03:42:36.800 --> 03:42:50.800]  and treacherous and treasonous, literally, and they are, and i saw the Wall Street Journal headline, NRA sells out America, and even the Wall Street Journal admitted, i mean this legislation is right out of Soviet Russia
[03:42:50.800 --> 03:43:10.800]  right, and you know, the Lord said the middle of darkness rather than light when their deeds are evil, and that's what we got going on, we got a bunch of evil that's going on, and they don't want the light of day, the internet puts the light of day on it, talk radio puts the light of day on it, Ron Paul's campaign for liberty puts the light of day on it
[03:43:10.800 --> 03:43:21.800]  and that's what they're doing, they're trying to cover the light so that they can continue to operate in darkness
[03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:31.800]  do you ever scratch yourself, pinch yourself, i know i do all the time, i mean it's one thing intellectually years ago, know that the globalists were planning this because we had their own documents, they've been public about it
[03:43:31.800 --> 03:43:46.800]  but to see them actually doing it, government hijacking of healthcare, and actually cutting the care to people, trying to launch new wars, trying to pass laws to secretly arrest citizens for no reason, openly saying they're going to take over the internet
[03:43:46.800 --> 03:43:59.800]  coming out with serious criminal investigations of campaign for liberty, when campaign for liberty is totally transparent, i mean, and now trying to block the American people from being able to know how someone voted
[03:43:59.800 --> 03:44:04.800]  i mean, these guys, they really are criminals
[03:44:04.800 --> 03:44:15.800]  well and not only that, i think that they feel that the momentum has been in their favor over the last several years, and it has quite frankly, and i think they're trying to seize the moment
[03:44:15.800 --> 03:44:31.800]  i think they're a little nervous about the Tea Party movement, i think they're a little nervous about the state sovereignty movements that's going on around the country, they're nervous about some of these state legislators and some of these candidates that are openly promoting secession and independence for their states
[03:44:31.800 --> 03:44:42.800]  i think they're nervous about Ron Paul, they're nervous about Alex Jones, Chuck Baldwin, and so forth, and so they're doing what they can do while they have the momentum to do it, and i think that's what we see going on here
[03:44:42.800 --> 03:44:49.800]  i think we're in a fight, and we just have to make up our minds that we're not going to roll over and play dead, and we're not going to let these people steal our country
[03:44:49.800 --> 03:45:02.800]  i mean, can you admit she's a socialist, i mean, and then Chris Matthews praises in his book and publicly Saul Alinsky and Lenin, but then if you say the government socialist, he says you're a racist
[03:45:02.800 --> 03:45:14.800]  i mean, these people know exactly what they're doing, i want to look at the audience who's watching on prisonplanet.tv and listening via AMFM, shortwave, satellite, XM, later on YouTube, at prisonplanet.tv later
[03:45:14.800 --> 03:45:18.800]  however you're watching, i want to look at you, and i want to say something
[03:45:18.800 --> 03:45:29.800]  they've got national TV specials coming out demonizing Chuck Baldwin, Ron Paul myself, they've got Pentagon and other government reports, state police, federal dossiers
[03:45:29.800 --> 03:45:33.800]  the Canadian police have them on us saying we're the enemy
[03:45:33.800 --> 03:45:40.800]  just little old pastor Chuck Baldwin, little old talk show host Alex Jones, little old Dr. Ron Paul, why are they scared?
[03:45:40.800 --> 03:45:50.800]  they're scared because we know who they are, we can see who they are, and they can see us exponentially reaching new people and the public waking up
[03:45:50.800 --> 03:45:57.800]  and as the darkness falls, they want to confiscate our candles because our little lights are getting brighter and brighter
[03:45:57.800 --> 03:46:04.800]  not because we're getting brighter but because the darkness is falling, they want to shut the web down, they want to stop free speech
[03:46:04.800 --> 03:46:13.800]  the curtains falling now, you have got to use the internet and videos and books and materials and donate and spread the word
[03:46:13.800 --> 03:46:20.800]  like your life depends on it and like the country's life depends on it, now we do not have time
[03:46:20.800 --> 03:46:29.800]  because the information you have and that we have and all of us have together is so powerful that they, before we're hubris filled and just trying to demonize us and ignore us
[03:46:29.800 --> 03:46:40.800]  now they just want to shut us off and it's because they're hemorrhaging to death, they have gambled to go for it all and we can grab victory out of the jaws of defeat
[03:46:40.800 --> 03:46:54.800]  or victory from the jaws of defeat now but please appreciate these shows, appreciate the websites, appreciate the info now because Chuck can you make it any simpler than I am or boil it down?
[03:46:54.800 --> 03:47:03.800]  I think you're doing a pretty good job Alex, exactly right, the American people have got to decide what they want for their children and for their future
[03:47:03.800 --> 03:47:13.800]  if they are just willing to have the shackles put around their necks and glibly go on into slavery and tyranny, let their children be raised in a tyrannical state
[03:47:13.800 --> 03:47:21.800]  well then so be it, make your choice, but for people that love freedom and love liberty and really do want their children to grow up in a land of freedom
[03:47:21.800 --> 03:47:27.800]  it's going to be up to us right now to fight for it as you said and I think that we've got to spend our money according to our convictions
[03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:34.800]  we've got to support those individuals and those institutions that are out on the front lines and we can't do it by ourselves
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:42.800]  none of us are able to do it by ourselves, none of us are independently wealthy, all of us are scratching for survival when it comes to paying the bills
[03:47:42.800 --> 03:47:52.800]  and if people out there are going to have an impact on their country they've got to dig down and they've got to support those institutions and those people to draw the front lines fighting for their freedom
[03:47:52.800 --> 03:47:59.800]  and if we're not willing to do that, Alex, quite frankly, then it's gone
[03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:06.800]  I mean we're to the point now where this thing is getting close to the curtain coming down
[03:48:06.800 --> 03:48:12.800]  and I know you know that and I know a lot of your listeners know that, but I've just got to say that
[03:48:12.800 --> 03:48:22.800]  we are getting close, I mean this thing is escalating exponentially in a way that I quite frankly am a little surprised at
[03:48:22.800 --> 03:48:28.800]  I knew it was going to grow, I knew it was going to escalate, I had no idea it was going to be this fast
[03:48:28.800 --> 03:48:36.800]  and let's face it, this is not just Barack Obama, we had the same thing going on with Bush, the same thing going on with Clinton
[03:48:36.800 --> 03:48:43.800]  now it's in rocket power, but I mean now it's, I mean I agree with you though, I'm amazed at how fast it's moving
[03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:49.800]  and you've got Sarah Palin now out in human events targeting real Tea Party candidates
[03:48:49.800 --> 03:48:55.800]  you've got targeting Ron Paul type candidates, even though she endorsed Rand, she's showing her colors there
[03:48:55.800 --> 03:49:02.800]  the whole system is getting more and more desperate, but now is the time to throw it all in the line folks
[03:49:02.800 --> 03:49:07.800]  now is the time to come to the aid of your country, America's never been perfect, but it's a Christian nation
[03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:13.800]  it's been the best in the world, the wealthiest because of the blessings of liberty that God gave us because we did do the right thing
[03:49:13.800 --> 03:49:19.800]  and that engine of freedom is dying and the choice is being made now
[03:49:19.800 --> 03:49:25.800]  you better be at your city councils, your county commissioners, your water districts talking about this, you better be at the state house
[03:49:25.800 --> 03:49:32.800]  you better be calling the talk radio, you had better not wait to start an organization, you better get out there now
[03:49:32.800 --> 03:49:37.800]  and point at this tyranny for what it is and point out this is illegal and wrong
[03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:46.800]  and we had better point out that it is both parties like Chuck Baldwin said, but under Obama Chuck hasn't it gone into overdrive?
[03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:55.800]  it's gone into overdrive, no doubt about it, but that's because the foundation was already laid, I predicted this back in the Bush years
[03:49:55.800 --> 03:50:03.800]  I said that if Obama is elected he is just going to expedite everything that's already been laid and put in place
[03:50:03.800 --> 03:50:08.800]  Bush just laid the table for him and of course Clinton did before that
[03:50:08.800 --> 03:50:17.800]  and now that he's got the Congress, he being Obama, they're able to implement these things that were put in place back during the Bush years
[03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:26.800]  but it's just exploding, we got the oil thing which is such a distraction to other things that are going on
[03:50:26.800 --> 03:50:33.800]  it's not a serious thing down here, I live on the Gulf Coast, we're dealing with what's going on down here with that up close and personal
[03:50:33.800 --> 03:50:39.800]  so I know what's going on, but there are some other things that are happening that the American people are not seeing
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:43.800]  and the National News Media is not telling us things that you talk about all the time on your show Alex
[03:50:43.800 --> 03:50:52.800]  and if the American people don't rise up now to resist, the spirit of resistance, Thomas Jefferson talked about
[03:50:52.800 --> 03:50:57.800]  Stay there, come back and tell us about the spirit of resistance and the issues the oil spill is overshadowing
[03:50:57.800 --> 03:51:05.800]  Chuck Baldwin's our guest, stay with us
[03:51:05.800 --> 03:51:10.800]  tyranny is here, the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality
[03:51:10.800 --> 03:51:13.800]  it really says that the state is God
[03:51:13.800 --> 03:51:18.800]  the United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth
[03:51:18.800 --> 03:51:23.800]  this film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[03:51:23.800 --> 03:51:31.800]  now being expanded nationwide, this documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state
[03:51:31.800 --> 03:51:35.800]  police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen
[03:51:35.800 --> 03:51:39.800]  prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship
[03:51:39.800 --> 03:51:45.800]  body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner
[03:51:45.800 --> 03:51:49.800]  it's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan

[03:53:57.800 --> 03:54:26.800]  right now
[03:54:27.800 --> 03:54:55.800]  I think Obama and the administration knew about the problems that the BP will have as early as January and February of this year
[03:54:55.800 --> 03:55:01.800]  I think they deliberately did nothing in order to exacerbate the problem
[03:55:01.800 --> 03:55:06.800]  I personally believe, at least let's put it this way, I suspect sabotage
[03:55:06.800 --> 03:55:15.800]  I suspect that Halliburton and the Bush Clinton crime cabal is behind a lot of this
[03:55:15.800 --> 03:55:17.800]  BP is going to go bankrupt over this
[03:55:17.800 --> 03:55:27.800]  and it's not an accident that it was a BP oil well that was targeted because there is a major rift going on right now
[03:55:27.800 --> 03:55:36.800]  between the higher level officials in Great Britain and the Bush Clinton crimes
[03:55:36.800 --> 03:55:42.800]  for those that don't know it's on record with CIA officer Terry Reed and others that Bush and Clinton actually worked together
[03:55:42.800 --> 03:55:43.800]  that's all a staged event
[03:55:43.800 --> 03:55:48.800]  shifting gears, what else in your view is the oil spill distracting from?
[03:55:48.800 --> 03:55:51.800]  I think it's from the healthcare takeover that's happening
[03:55:51.800 --> 03:55:57.800]  well obviously they want to use it to pass the cap and trade energy monstrosity
[03:55:57.800 --> 03:56:02.800]  but I think what it's overlooking is Alex there's probably $6 trillion
[03:56:02.800 --> 03:56:05.800]  and I know we throw these numbers around and nobody can calculate that high
[03:56:05.800 --> 03:56:10.800]  but we're talking $6 trillion that's hanging around out there
[03:56:10.800 --> 03:56:18.800]  that the British government or I should say the British bankers believe has been stolen from them
[03:56:18.800 --> 03:56:25.800]  and whenever this well went up and all the pressure now that's placed upon BP
[03:56:25.800 --> 03:56:27.800]  and probably going to go bankrupt
[03:56:27.800 --> 03:56:32.800]  and what that's going to do throughout Britain and Europe
[03:56:32.800 --> 03:56:39.800]  I believe this was a signal by the people that stole that money to say leave us alone
[03:56:39.800 --> 03:56:44.800]  there are things here going on Alex that I believe that are so criminal
[03:56:44.800 --> 03:56:49.800]  that are so evil that are so sinister that the American people know nothing about you
[03:56:49.800 --> 03:56:54.800]  and the American media especially is not going to tell us anything that we need to know
[03:56:54.800 --> 03:56:58.800]  but there are things going on behind the scenes here that this oil well is a diversion
[03:56:58.800 --> 03:57:00.800]  or maybe we could even say a warning
[03:57:00.800 --> 03:57:05.800]  well I mean take the Federal Reserve reorganization that even the Washington Post admits
[03:57:05.800 --> 03:57:09.800]  gives them unlimited power over all financial institutions
[03:57:09.800 --> 03:57:12.800]  and things that affect the economy in Andrew DePolitanos words
[03:57:12.800 --> 03:57:15.800]  this is a total seizure of the economy
[03:57:15.800 --> 03:57:19.800]  so the Federal Reserve engineers the banking collapse now they get even more power
[03:57:19.800 --> 03:57:21.800]  I mean it's all happening right now
[03:57:21.800 --> 03:57:25.800]  bird dying has sabotaged that at least for the next few weeks
[03:57:25.800 --> 03:57:27.800]  that's actually a gift from God
[03:57:27.800 --> 03:57:30.800]  I'm not glad he's dead but that screwed up the passage of it
[03:57:30.800 --> 03:57:34.800]  but I mean this is amazing so it's all happening at once
[03:57:34.800 --> 03:57:39.800]  it is and it's all happening I think in a coordinated effort
[03:57:39.800 --> 03:57:42.800]  I do not believe that these things are isolated instances
[03:57:42.800 --> 03:57:45.800]  I just don't believe that these things are too big
[03:57:45.800 --> 03:57:49.800]  they are too coincidental and the ramifications are too monstrous
[03:57:49.800 --> 03:57:56.800]  to suggest that this is not something but a design behind it
[03:57:56.800 --> 03:57:58.800]  and I think that's exactly what's going on
[03:57:58.800 --> 03:58:02.800]  and I think it's all related to some of what I'm talking about here today
[03:58:02.800 --> 03:58:04.800]  some of the things that you're talking about obviously
[03:58:04.800 --> 03:58:08.800]  they're not going to ever let a crisis go without using it
[03:58:08.800 --> 03:58:12.800]  absolutely Chuck Baldwin author
[03:58:12.800 --> 03:58:15.800]  the Presidential Candidate

[03:58:36.800 --> 03:58:38.800]  the enemy is coming out to persecute us
[03:58:38.800 --> 03:59:02.800]  that story is up on prismplanet.com
