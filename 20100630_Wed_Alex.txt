[00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:09.772]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.772 --> 00:00:11.373]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.373 --> 00:00:12.914]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:17.116]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:24.660]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.883]  I tell ya, this broadcast is a war zone, my friends.
[00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:35.276]  I cannot believe how hardcore the news is getting, how it's intensifying every day.
[00:00:35.276 --> 00:00:39.438]  It is Wednesday, the 30th day of June, 2010, and we're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:51.894]  Let me just run through the headlines here.
[00:00:51.894 --> 00:00:56.897]  Dollar should be replaced by international standard, UN report says.
[00:00:56.897 --> 00:01:06.441]  CNN, this right after the G20 met, of course, we've been telling you for years about the SDR, global government currency, issued by private banks.
[00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:10.864]  Here it is, in full, admitted, no more doubts.
[00:01:12.163 --> 00:01:18.872]  Also, Bloomberg reports, banks financing Mexico gangs admitted in Wells Fargo deal.
[00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:25.020]  All the big major Federal Reserve member banks have been caught laundering billions of dollars of narcotics money.
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.565]  Well, of course, they run the narcotics operations.
[00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:29.606]  That is Bloomberg.
[00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:41.153]  And that's why all the king's horses and all the king's men work around the clock to keep drugs illegal, to keep the price up on their main product and their excuse to hunt us and put us in their private prisons.
[00:01:41.153 --> 00:01:42.194]  Wake up to that fact.
[00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:44.416]  They are the drug dealers.
[00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.997]  Hurricane Alex turns towards Mexico.
[00:01:48.118 --> 00:01:53.402]  Texas Coast, as you know, yesterday Rick Perry declared an emergency in South Texas.
[00:01:53.402 --> 00:01:59.487]  It has become a hurricane and it is blowing the oil directly at Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida.
[00:01:59.487 --> 00:02:09.015]  It is coming up from the southwest, turning up towards the east and set to slam in and make landfall right at the Texas-Mexico border.
[00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:11.435]  Really?
[00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:29.713]  Yes.
[00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:52.146]  That's already been too late because the hurricanes will be driving the oil into the United States.
[00:02:52.146 --> 00:02:57.091]  BP is controlling access to medical care for Gulf oil cleanup workers.
[00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:57.932]  That's being reported.
[00:02:57.932 --> 00:03:02.736]  All part of the massive takeover and a cover-up of just how deadly this is.
[00:03:04.338 --> 00:03:12.021]  That's why they won't let the workers wear respirators, because then they'd have to admit that the air is deadly in these areas where they're engaged in the clean-ups of the toxic sludge.
[00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:16.922]  Just like on 9-11, for a week they told emergency workers, don't wear a mask, you don't need it.
[00:03:16.922 --> 00:03:25.025]  Because if they would have said, wear a mask, then they would have had to admit that the air was dirty and they couldn't have reopened Wall Street or the schools and other businesses.
[00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:29.650]  And so they told the cops and the firemen and everybody else, don't wear a mask.
[00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.631]  The air is clean.
[00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:37.860]  And even though there was several feet of deadly toxic asbestos and shattered glass dust on the ground.
[00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:44.327]  The people said, well, I'm not a conspiracy theorist to question anything as a conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:46.488]  I must do whatever the media and the government tells me.
[00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:48.330]  So we're not going to wear a mask.
[00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.552]  And of course, lots of them are dead now.
[00:03:50.552 --> 00:03:51.513]  It's the same thing here.
[00:03:51.513 --> 00:03:52.914]  But you do not question the media.
[00:03:52.914 --> 00:03:54.956]  Do you do not question BP?
[00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:59.300]  BP says that this crude oil doesn't have any toxins coming off of it.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.924]  And I've got clips of Obama saying there's not any toxic problems and it's safe for workers.
[00:04:03.924 --> 00:04:05.265]  You don't need any respirators.
[00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:05.685]  And so
[00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:09.048]  Later, good luck getting any health care when you're dying.
[00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:19.760]  In fact, I've got even CBS News reports where people are going in who don't smoke, who are emergency workers, and they're being told, you've got the lungs of a three-pack-a-day person who's been smoking for 30 years.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.881]  Your lungs are fried.
[00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.157]  And that's working in that toxic oil.
[00:04:24.157 --> 00:04:32.623]  And more important, the dispersant that's four to six times, depending on which variant they're using, as toxic as the most toxic crude oil.
[00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:38.887]  And they've sprayed 200 plus thousand gallons just in the first 60 days.
[00:04:38.887 --> 00:04:40.148]  And we're 70-something in now.
[00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:42.950]  I tried to look for the statistics and couldn't find it.
[00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.653]  200 plus thousand gallons of that sprayed.
[00:04:47.768 --> 00:04:48.608]  Out there.
[00:04:48.608 --> 00:04:49.629]  Oh, excuse me, here's the article.
[00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:50.929]  I'm sorry, barrels, barrels.
[00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:54.751]  And like I said, the big Taiwan oil skimmer can do 50,000 barrels.
[00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:58.733]  I'm sorry, it's 500,000 barrels a day, but Obama is blocking that skimmer.
[00:04:58.733 --> 00:04:59.153]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.150]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[00:05:48.390 --> 00:06:03.134]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:03.134 --> 00:06:08.475]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:10.515]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:15.517]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:15.517 --> 00:06:16.697]  How much do you want?
[00:06:16.697 --> 00:06:17.437]  When do you want it?
[00:06:17.817 --> 00:06:19.697]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:19.697 --> 00:06:20.778]  When will you need it?
[00:06:20.778 --> 00:06:22.978]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:22.978 --> 00:06:24.299]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:25.839]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:31.100]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.681]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:34.681 --> 00:06:38.162]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:38.502 --> 00:06:39.723]  How much will you need?
[00:06:39.723 --> 00:06:40.643]  We don't know.
[00:06:40.643 --> 00:06:41.743]  How much do you want?
[00:06:41.743 --> 00:06:42.664]  All you can get.
[00:06:42.664 --> 00:06:43.764]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.764 --> 00:06:46.805]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:08:05.137 --> 00:08:09.980]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.561]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:13.102]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.102 --> 00:08:17.304]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:22.927]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.927 --> 00:08:32.593]  Alright, let me start back into these headlines here for you.
[00:08:38.308 --> 00:08:42.970]  Dollar should be replaced as international standard, UN report says.
[00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.590]  That's CNN.
[00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.272]  Banks financing Mexico gangs admitted in Wells Fargo deal.
[00:08:49.272 --> 00:08:54.153]  America's biggest banks are treacherous outside corporate interest.
[00:08:54.153 --> 00:08:56.454]  They are enemy spy organizations.
[00:08:56.454 --> 00:09:02.236]  They are society wrecking financial takeover artists.
[00:09:02.236 --> 00:09:05.137]  Hurricane Alex turns towards Mexico and Texas coast.
[00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:07.226]  Here's another one.
[00:09:07.226 --> 00:09:18.032]  By the way, we have Congressman Ron Paul joining us tomorrow to talk about this and a lot of other important issues like the oil spill, the impending war with Iran, what's happening with the economy.
[00:09:18.032 --> 00:09:19.913]  This is directly from Ron Paul's office.
[00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:24.535]  It's going up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:09:24.535 --> 00:09:29.318]  And it's from Congressman Ron Paul, going up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:35.634]  They are attacking us, they say, because they're having an effect.
[00:09:35.634 --> 00:09:47.988]  The Federal Elections Commission has launched a pair of investigations on Campaign for Liberty, which have always been extreme sticklers in following the Byzantine federal law.
[00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:49.950]  They've created a political action committee.
[00:09:50.991 --> 00:10:00.599]  And they go out and find candidates that believe in the Constitution and Bill of Rights and so they will be gone after because they're becoming effective.
[00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:05.823]  Just like the system is trying to now shut down the free internet as we know it.
[00:10:05.823 --> 00:10:10.786]  So that is coming up a little bit later in this hour as well.
[00:10:11.747 --> 00:10:12.627]  Third U.S.
[00:10:12.627 --> 00:10:15.629]  carrier, 4,000 Marines augment U.S.
[00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:17.650]  armada opposite Iran.
[00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:22.792]  That's out of Debka file, but I was able to pull it up in mainstream Israeli papers as well.
[00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:30.136]  They're also moving troop carriers that can launch helicopter and ground force assaults into Iran.
[00:10:30.136 --> 00:10:38.460]  And they're looking now to pass even more sanctions to start boarding their ships, an expanded act of war on that front.
[00:10:41.011 --> 00:11:01.836]  Continuing, no extra powers granted to police during G20 Summit, that's the Toronto Star, the police just lied and said they didn't need due process, they could now arrest anyone they wanted for no reason, and that they could not allow filming, and that they could arrest basically anyone for any reason.
[00:11:01.836 --> 00:11:04.417]  And of course it was a complete lie.
[00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:08.038]  And this is the dream of police now, worldwide, is to be God.
[00:11:08.786 --> 00:11:13.390]  You become an officer, you become someone literally above Christ himself.
[00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.993]  You become, you know, above all, above Zeus.
[00:11:16.993 --> 00:11:20.175]  You are just God.
[00:11:20.175 --> 00:11:33.787]  And I saw a video interview on Democracy Now, the London Guardian reporter, who was simply there covering it, and they arrested a bunch of the mainstream media, and were letting him go, and they saw his Guardian pass.
[00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:37.112]  I don't know.
[00:11:58.428 --> 00:12:00.993]  That'll teach you, reporter.
[00:12:00.993 --> 00:12:06.644]  And it's just, you take people who couldn't get a job at anything else.
[00:12:06.644 --> 00:12:08.688]  You take people who couldn't pump gas.
[00:12:10.086 --> 00:12:16.508]  You take people who would lose their job at McDonald's, and you give them a badge and a gun, and then you militarize them.
[00:12:16.508 --> 00:12:18.969]  You know, military is meant to kill people and break things.
[00:12:18.969 --> 00:12:26.131]  Military is meant to be silent and deadly and to be honed professional killers that you use to defend your nation.
[00:12:26.131 --> 00:12:36.795]  But now they've militarized the police, they have hired deranged veterans who've served two, three, four, five tours, and they teach them to give the American people no quarter.
[00:12:38.015 --> 00:12:40.576]  And the same thing in Canada, the same thing in England.
[00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:43.898]  We are descending.
[00:12:43.898 --> 00:13:03.346]  The entire Western culture, I mean, I'm looking at photos and videos, and I was just reminded by one of them on screen at prisonplanet.com up there in the rotating tiles, of a little 10-year-old boy being choked by police and riot gear, and he's crying with terror on his face, and the police have looks of enjoyment.
[00:13:04.605 --> 00:13:12.301]  This is the type of people that we finance and that we've given unlimited power over to us who just enjoy beating the hell out of people.
[00:13:12.301 --> 00:13:14.766]  And we're only about one inch away
[00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:37.788]  From living like they do in Cairo, where there was a blogger who'd been exposing police beating people, and so they went and found out where he was at a internet cafe, and they marched him outside, and the newspapers reported that witnesses said it took them 20 minutes of bashing his head into a metal railing to kill him until his brains came out.
[00:13:37.788 --> 00:13:40.590]  I mean, they were just gonna beat his head until his brains came out.
[00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.352]  You don't show us
[00:13:44.244 --> 00:13:52.607]  Killing or hurting people, or we will come get you as a member of the press and we will beat your brains out.
[00:13:52.607 --> 00:14:01.889]  That's how they are in Iran, it's how they are in Russia in the past, that's how they were in East Germany, and that's how we're becoming here today.
[00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:08.411]  And I know a lot of police are not evil, are not thugs, are not sadists, but they're promoting the sadist.
[00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:12.673]  And in press report after press report, where media got beat up, including
[00:14:14.463 --> 00:14:22.630]  Mainstream CBC TV reporters, CTV national news reporters, with their big professional cameras in their media outfits.
[00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:28.755]  The police were so mad dog crazy, they would attack them as well.
[00:14:28.755 --> 00:14:33.159]  Just peaceful crowds, just attack them.
[00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:34.981]  On video.
[00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:41.887]  And the reporters, in report after report describe, cops will walk up and say, this is a smart mouth reporter.
[00:14:43.442 --> 00:14:47.067]  Yeah, they think they're going to push us around, show them.
[00:14:47.067 --> 00:14:50.191]  And so one group of cops would chant things like that.
[00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:59.584]  And then the other cops would then rush forward, knocking them down with their shields and then beating them on the ground, laughing and growling.
[00:15:01.089 --> 00:15:07.053]  And it's kind of like if you've got a chihuahua or a little dog and it's fun sometimes to train them to get, you know, who is it?
[00:15:07.053 --> 00:15:08.034]  Who is it at the door?
[00:15:08.034 --> 00:15:08.634]  Get him!
[00:15:08.634 --> 00:15:09.255]  Get him!
[00:15:09.255 --> 00:15:09.595]  Get him!
[00:15:09.595 --> 00:15:18.641]  And the dog will, you know, halfway playing with it and it'll start scratching with its back legs, you know, like a bull strutting.
[00:15:19.642 --> 00:15:30.748]  And it's a joke, but no, this is the boiled down lowest common denominator mob psychology where the cops are like, get him, yeah, let's get him.
[00:15:30.748 --> 00:15:34.391]  And each person then escalates the next one.
[00:15:34.391 --> 00:15:35.691]  And I've seen cops admit this.
[00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:38.693]  Well, we did shotgun that girl in the Red Sox one.
[00:15:38.693 --> 00:15:43.256]  She came out of a bar and we shot her at one foot away with rubber bullets and blew her head off.
[00:15:43.256 --> 00:15:48.659]  Bullets went into her brain, the rubber bullets, and the cops from the news saying no one's going to be charged because it was just adrenaline.
[00:15:49.502 --> 00:15:59.672]  Yeah, she's some 21-year-old journalism student with no criminal record who walked out of a bar because the Red Sox had won, and the cops showed up and just shot her in the face.
[00:15:59.672 --> 00:16:00.213]  It's weird.
[00:16:00.213 --> 00:16:04.397]  Cops seem to go crazy on non-violent, passive people.
[00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:09.663]  But when illegal aliens are burning cars and tumping vehicles over in Los Angeles, the cops back off.
[00:16:10.954 --> 00:16:18.235]  Or when guys who are dressed up and look like cops wearing Nike outfits, and we've caught them in that same area in Ottawa, just a few miles away from Toronto.
[00:16:18.235 --> 00:16:26.777]  I mean, it's, CBC admits, the police admit, yes, we attacked our own officers, yes, we staged events to try to, you know.
[00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:27.597]  So they've been caught.
[00:16:27.597 --> 00:16:29.598]  And I've watched the video.
[00:16:29.598 --> 00:16:35.319]  Those aren't meth-head kind of mainline college communists that call themselves anarchists.
[00:16:36.583 --> 00:16:38.984]  Because, I guess, communism's supposedly out.
[00:16:38.984 --> 00:16:40.604]  So you've got to be covert about it.
[00:16:40.604 --> 00:16:45.506]  Now, these are not your occasional meth-head with a scraggly beard.
[00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:46.206]  These were cops.
[00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:50.147]  I mean, I could take one look at them, or they were military special forces.
[00:16:50.147 --> 00:16:52.088]  And the cops stood back and let them burn the cars.
[00:16:52.088 --> 00:16:56.009]  I mean, that's your... Can you imagine if somebody else tried to burn a car?
[00:16:56.009 --> 00:16:59.030]  The cops would shoot you, and they should.
[00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:04.792]  Setting a car on fire is a very dangerous act that can kill people.
[00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:05.012]  But...
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.520]  No.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:22.466]  If an average blood bag, and that's what the American people are and the Canadian people are, if a vampire saw a blood bag, a blood bottle, a meal, a prey animal lighting fire, instinctively prey animals have got to be kept in line.
[00:17:22.466 --> 00:17:25.527]  If you let one of those ants stand up, they'll all stand up.
[00:17:25.527 --> 00:17:27.267]  It's not about food, it's about control.
[00:17:29.068 --> 00:17:33.031]  Lying from a bug's life with the grasshoppers.
[00:17:33.031 --> 00:17:37.794]  Again, if a blood bag actually set fire to a vehicle, they would probably gun them down.
[00:17:37.794 --> 00:17:45.980]  But when an imperial stormtrooper does it, we're made to believe that it's the Sand People.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.022]  But only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
[00:17:49.022 --> 00:17:51.925]  I've never heard of Sand People hitting something this big.
[00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:57.669]  I'll use a popular culture false flag type fiction example for you.
[00:17:59.028 --> 00:18:06.208]  And we know that the Imperial Storm Troopers, the Royal Mounted Police in Canada, have been caught from coast to coast staging events.
[00:18:07.403 --> 00:18:22.398]  Hell, I had him running around in plainclothes, obviously cops, you could take one look at him, and, you know, going, let's do something violent, Alex, let's, you know, let's, and I'd say, come on, man, I know you're a cop, and they'd say, they'd notice that my camera wasn't on, they'd say, well, what are you planning?
[00:18:22.398 --> 00:18:25.881]  And it was just like they were even admitting they were cops, and I'm going, come on, leave me alone.
[00:18:25.881 --> 00:18:31.066]  You guys already had your fun with me at the, at the airplane border when I landed, and,
[00:18:32.637 --> 00:18:37.338]  So, I mean, do you really want to live in a country where your guys set fires to things?
[00:18:37.338 --> 00:18:38.658]  And where you attack other cops?
[00:18:38.658 --> 00:18:40.819]  You attack city cops in Toronto?
[00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:43.519]  Or you attack city cops in Ottawa or Montebello?
[00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:45.920]  So you can have your pretext to go after everybody?
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.500]  And I haven't even gotten to some of our top stories yet.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:54.841]  I'm already digressing down a rabbit trail.
[00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:57.982]  When we come back, activists arrested on bogus charge
[00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:02.582]  To cover for illegal conduct of Toronto Police.
[00:19:02.582 --> 00:19:11.089]  Charlie Veach, trying to get on an airplane yesterday and we get the text message, they've got me, Charlie said, get help.
[00:19:11.089 --> 00:19:22.019]  So we had the Infowars.com article out on that and then later we learned he had been taken to the police department and charged and we have major newspapers here with the headlines.
[00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:25.422]  Let me just read you one of the headlines here that
[00:19:27.932 --> 00:19:50.578]  that they have in the newspapers and radio stations about man arrested for impersonating police and because he called himself the love police and on one video began joking saying oh you know I could even be an undercover cop like you guys have out here staging riots and so they're saying that and the term love police means he was
[00:19:51.932 --> 00:19:54.713]  I guess sting of the police needs to be arrested.
[00:19:54.713 --> 00:20:00.555]  And so they're now holding a British citizen in another Commonwealth country for thought crime.

[00:21:09.617 --> 00:21:12.520]  And now experimenting with viruses.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.581]  Viruses.
[00:21:13.581 --> 00:21:19.306]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:21:19.306 --> 00:21:21.488]  Starve or surrender.
[00:21:21.488 --> 00:21:22.268]  Surrender.
[00:21:22.268 --> 00:21:26.092]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.

[00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.013]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[00:22:03.013 --> 00:22:08.379]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:22:08.379 --> 00:22:10.901]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:22:10.901 --> 00:22:13.885]  Are the majority of your assets tied up in the stock or bond market?
[00:22:13.885 --> 00:22:17.008]  If so, are those assets working for you or against you?
[00:22:17.008 --> 00:22:22.354]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy,
[00:22:22.654 --> 00:22:23.394]  Or the dollar.
[00:22:23.394 --> 00:22:25.276]  Your investment will never be worthless.
[00:22:25.276 --> 00:22:27.357]  And it will protect you from that hidden tax.
[00:22:27.357 --> 00:22:28.117]  Inflation.
[00:22:28.117 --> 00:22:32.660]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, the time is now.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.321]  Gold is at an all-time high and continues to move up.
[00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:35.922]  I can help.
[00:22:35.922 --> 00:22:36.582]  Call me today.

[00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:01.574]  Who is Sam Andy?

[00:23:10.257 --> 00:23:11.298]  Why so long?
[00:23:11.298 --> 00:23:11.838]  Simple.
[00:23:11.838 --> 00:23:15.660]  Sam Andy Foods have perfected the taste and quality of low-moisture foods.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.301]  Foods that last 15 to 25 years.

[00:23:23.203 --> 00:23:25.044]  People living in remote areas, U.S.
[00:23:25.044 --> 00:23:27.205]  troops in wartime, and many others.

[00:23:46.772 --> 00:23:49.673]  Coming up, I'm gonna get into the latest developments
[00:24:17.458 --> 00:24:31.243]  Dealing with the oil spill and the hurricane destined to blow a lot more of that toxic sludge into the shoreline of the United States.
[00:24:31.243 --> 00:24:41.707]  We'll also get into the incredible developments with the G20 openly announcing the global conversion away from the dollar to a new private SDR.
[00:24:43.513 --> 00:24:57.580]  Now I know for our listeners, that is very old news, but now it's becoming official and we need to discuss ways to stop this A and B, what it's going to mean if they're able to complete this conversion.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.901]  You think the economy is bad now?
[00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:07.004]  You think these bankers that have destroyed our society and bought off our police and committed all these crimes, you think it's bad now?
[00:25:07.004 --> 00:25:09.105]  We ain't seen nothing yet, as they say.
[00:25:10.635 --> 00:25:33.059]  Now, this next news is so incredible, I really want to put an exclamation point psychologically behind this and amongst all the other incredible news that we're covering, but authoritarian oppression is marching and going wild and basically blitzkrieging on every front in an attempt to just overwhelm free societies everywhere.
[00:25:34.835 --> 00:25:38.337]  Classically tyrannical nations are becoming more oppressive.
[00:25:38.337 --> 00:25:49.343]  But once free nations are not going slowly, but are now just fully imploding and collapsing into hardcore oppression.
[00:25:49.343 --> 00:25:51.625]  Night has fallen in Canada.
[00:25:51.625 --> 00:25:53.326]  Night is falling in the United States.
[00:25:53.326 --> 00:25:55.307]  Night has fallen in England.
[00:25:55.307 --> 00:26:00.310]  The police have, by every yardstick and measurement, been turned into classical tyrants.
[00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:10.434]  We see Supreme Court nominees and justices voting for total gun control, for attacks on free speech, for federal takeover of the internet.
[00:26:10.434 --> 00:26:12.055]  We see the same thing happening in Europe.
[00:26:13.476 --> 00:26:15.778]  They are moving against us.
[00:26:15.778 --> 00:26:21.283]  They are now persecuting Ron Paul, and Ron Paul says this is a political attack.
[00:26:21.283 --> 00:26:25.607]  They know that Campaign for Liberty candidates are winning primaries nationwide.
[00:26:25.607 --> 00:26:37.097]  They know this is a real restoration through our voting system, and they are going to try to start wars, emergency oil spills, domestic terror attacks, you name it.
[00:26:38.353 --> 00:26:41.575]  They've tried to set up the Hatari militia to demonize patriots.
[00:26:41.575 --> 00:26:42.856]  They are moving against us.
[00:26:42.856 --> 00:26:48.339]  This is a violent revolution by criminal offshore banks.
[00:26:48.339 --> 00:26:53.962]  And I'm going to tie that in with the Russian spies coming up in the next segment.
[00:26:53.962 --> 00:26:56.084]  Of course there's Russian spies in this country.
[00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.330]  But what about the banks?
[00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.951]  What about global corporations?
[00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:01.471]  They are the big threat.
[00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:03.291]  What about the Chinese?
[00:27:03.291 --> 00:27:04.751]  What about Israeli spies?
[00:27:04.751 --> 00:27:07.052]  I mean, they've infiltrated every level of this government.
[00:27:07.052 --> 00:27:08.152]  That's admitted.
[00:27:08.152 --> 00:27:09.132]  Running much of U.S.
[00:27:09.132 --> 00:27:10.253]  foreign policy.
[00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:11.333]  No one even debates that.
[00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:12.873]  Israel brags about it.
[00:27:12.873 --> 00:27:16.774]  Netanyahu brags.
[00:27:16.774 --> 00:27:22.015]  The former Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, bragged in Jerusalem Post and Haaretz about it.
[00:27:23.395 --> 00:27:30.117]  I mean, America is a whorehouse for anybody that wants to come here and sell this country out.
[00:27:30.117 --> 00:27:32.658]  So why are they going after the Russians now?
[00:27:32.658 --> 00:27:40.060]  Because as bad as the Russian government is and all the corruption they've got, they're not part of the New World Order, as far as I can research and tell.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.981]  They've said they want their own New World Order.
[00:27:44.144 --> 00:27:45.726]  The Chinese are a big part of it.
[00:27:45.726 --> 00:27:49.349]  That's why they can have 3,000 plus front companies and growing.
[00:27:49.349 --> 00:27:53.573]  That's why they can have Chinese generals in the White House and in the Commerce Department.
[00:27:53.573 --> 00:27:56.876]  That's why they can have everything.
[00:27:56.876 --> 00:27:57.657]  That's why the U.S.
[00:27:57.657 --> 00:28:01.101]  sells its weapon systems to Israel and Israel openly gives it to China.
[00:28:01.101 --> 00:28:01.861]  But you get some...
[00:28:02.961 --> 00:28:05.722]  Russian infiltrators, that's a classic form of it.
[00:28:05.722 --> 00:28:07.003]  Of course they're spies.
[00:28:07.003 --> 00:28:10.704]  I've seen people spinning it in the Russian media that they were reporters.
[00:28:10.704 --> 00:28:20.507]  Anybody who comes here illegally, anybody that has fake husband and wife teams trouncing around, yeah, those are spies, folks.
[00:28:20.507 --> 00:28:27.190]  And if you don't think the United States has got spies all over Russia, deep cover, husband and wife teams, you got another thing coming.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.644]  And if you don't think the Israelis have got teams over here and everywhere else, you got another thing coming.
[00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:41.992]  The Israelis admit their ratio of human intelligence spies is the biggest in the world, comparatively to their population.
[00:28:41.992 --> 00:28:43.753]  There are spies all over the place.
[00:28:43.753 --> 00:28:45.294]  But let me tell you what's even more important.
[00:28:45.294 --> 00:28:46.816]  Corporate spies.
[00:28:46.816 --> 00:28:49.358]  They openly come in and buy your politicians in plain view.
[00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.752]  They openly go and write the laws.
[00:28:53.752 --> 00:28:56.293]  94% of the laws aren't even read in Congress.
[00:28:56.293 --> 00:28:58.655]  You know where the espionage is going on?
[00:28:58.655 --> 00:28:59.876]  It's the Federal Reserve.
[00:28:59.876 --> 00:29:01.817]  They had a financial coup d'etat in 1913.
[00:29:01.817 --> 00:29:08.121]  They would have already passed it this week if Robert Byrd hadn't died.
[00:29:08.121 --> 00:29:09.362]  He was the one vote they needed.
[00:29:09.362 --> 00:29:12.223]  That's a godsend for us to stop this situation.
[00:29:12.223 --> 00:29:17.567]  That 92-year-old monster has gone off to be with his father.
[00:29:19.104 --> 00:29:24.227]  We know who his father is, the father of lies.
[00:29:24.227 --> 00:29:26.749]  They are of their father, the devil.
[00:29:26.749 --> 00:29:29.291]  Alright, yeah, that's what I mean, it's just insane.
[00:29:29.291 --> 00:29:32.213]  I'm gonna cover that in detail, that was just a mini rant on the subject.
[00:29:32.213 --> 00:29:34.715]  But I'm gonna break down the Russian spy situation.
[00:29:34.715 --> 00:29:36.456]  What do you think Goldman Sachs is?
[00:29:36.456 --> 00:29:43.340]  I mean, Supreme Court Justice Kagan, Goldman Sachs, all the major federal regulatory positions over money, Goldman Sachs.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.222]  That's the same in all the other countries, they're robbing blind.
[00:29:46.222 --> 00:29:47.683]  These are enemy spies!
[00:29:50.697 --> 00:29:54.629]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.629 --> 00:29:57.316]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.878 --> 00:30:04.440]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.341]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.341 --> 00:30:08.783]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.783 --> 00:30:09.623]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.623 --> 00:30:14.526]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.526 --> 00:30:15.266]  It's true.
[00:30:15.266 --> 00:30:20.149]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.969]  Number 3.
[00:30:20.969 --> 00:30:24.551]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.551 --> 00:30:28.253]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.453 --> 00:30:29.253]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.253 --> 00:30:32.014]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.014 --> 00:30:35.695]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.695 --> 00:30:36.475]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.475 --> 00:30:40.616]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.616 --> 00:30:45.678]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:31:30.324 --> 00:31:31.825]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:31:53.195 --> 00:31:53.636]  Thank you!
[00:31:59.485 --> 00:32:01.808]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:32:01.808 --> 00:32:04.071]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:32:04.071 --> 00:32:07.415]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:32:07.415 --> 00:32:12.521]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:32:12.521 --> 00:32:16.706]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:32:17.006 --> 00:32:19.350]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.254]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:32:22.254 --> 00:32:25.158]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:32:25.158 --> 00:32:32.770]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:32:33.089 --> 00:32:38.494]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:32:38.494 --> 00:32:41.336]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:32:41.336 --> 00:32:45.039]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:46.100]  And I got news for you.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.441]  You're everyone else.
[00:32:47.441 --> 00:32:48.942]  Invisible Empire.
[00:32:48.942 --> 00:32:56.729]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or watch it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:28.633]  I'm going to get into the Russian situation that the media is covering like it is a giant asteroid about to destroy the Earth.
[00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:31.853]  It's the top story everywhere, as you know, the last two days.
[00:33:31.853 --> 00:33:35.174]  Meanwhile, they're gearing up for war with Iran publicly.
[00:33:35.174 --> 00:33:39.596]  The hurricane's coming into the Gulf and is driving a lot of the oil towards the shorelines.
[00:33:39.596 --> 00:33:40.676]  Complete disaster.
[00:33:40.676 --> 00:33:43.097]  The government now admits they may start evacuating.
[00:33:43.917 --> 00:33:46.518]  Hundreds of thousands, if not millions.
[00:33:46.518 --> 00:33:48.920]  We've got the stock markets plunging globally.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:54.162]  We've got open announcements of the end of the dollar in CNN and the Financial Times of London.
[00:33:54.162 --> 00:33:58.605]  The whole world is in flux right now, and we're hearing about 11 Russian spies.
[00:34:00.609 --> 00:34:02.669]  Globalism is treason.
[00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:20.733]  Globalism is offshore banks openly creating their own global currency and making you pay carbon taxes to them for the right to even have money for commerce and ruling everything and the government giving your islands and your roads and your national parks and your tax money to offshore banks.
[00:34:20.733 --> 00:34:27.294]  Now, if that isn't treason and espionage and financial conquest, what is?
[00:34:27.294 --> 00:34:27.414]  See?
[00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:31.492]  That's the final revolution the British developed in the last hundred years.
[00:34:31.492 --> 00:34:33.313]  They developed the model, but the corporates use it.
[00:34:33.313 --> 00:34:34.234]  It's not the British.
[00:34:34.234 --> 00:34:35.354]  It's just they developed the model.
[00:34:35.354 --> 00:34:44.160]  On record, Carol Quigley, the list goes on and on of top political professors, scientists, who were part of it, writing textbooks on it, 900 pages long.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.361]  Any of you can understand how the world really works.
[00:34:46.361 --> 00:34:51.704]  So I want to throw the gauntlet down to police, military, FBI, everyone who serves this system.
[00:34:51.704 --> 00:34:53.766]  This isn't your government anymore.
[00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:56.627]  This isn't America anymore.
[00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:58.989]  It isn't Canada or England anymore.
[00:34:58.989 --> 00:35:01.850]  This isn't Kansas anymore.
[00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.551]  You're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:35:03.551 --> 00:35:06.093]  It's a very simple statement, but it's true.
[00:35:06.093 --> 00:35:08.074]  We are not in Kansas anymore.
[00:35:08.074 --> 00:35:10.235]  You have got to get that through your head.
[00:35:10.235 --> 00:35:17.720]  I told you a decade ago they would have a global cashless currency that all currencies are based on in subunits.
[00:35:18.576 --> 00:35:21.318]  I did not look into a magic crystal ball.
[00:35:21.318 --> 00:35:26.662]  I did not go to Greece and climb the hill and talk to the Delphi Oracle.
[00:35:26.662 --> 00:35:29.444]  Nostradamus didn't tell me.
[00:35:29.444 --> 00:35:35.108]  I read Trilateral Commission and CFR white papers that were public.
[00:35:35.108 --> 00:35:40.852]  They are public about what they are doing to us.
[00:35:40.852 --> 00:35:43.514]  It is not a conspiracy theory.
[00:35:45.322 --> 00:35:54.852]  And here it is, CNN today, dollars should be replaced as international standard UN report says, two days after the G20 closed down its meeting.
[00:35:54.852 --> 00:35:57.495]  They have been ironing this out the last two years.
[00:35:57.495 --> 00:36:01.560]  They're officially doing it.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.923]  They are officially doing it.
[00:36:04.923 --> 00:36:07.246]  There were several plans in the past
[00:36:08.783 --> 00:36:11.245]  To do this, several different plans.
[00:36:11.245 --> 00:36:28.758]  In the 70s, they said they'd have three global currencies that have currency instability between the three currencies, and that they would then go to the one global cashless currency, and you could still have local currencies, but they'd be denominated and backed and controlled by the central private banking system.
[00:36:28.758 --> 00:36:35.603]  And that is now what they're doing, but they're just bypassing ever launching the Asian currency, and they're going directly to the SDR.
[00:36:38.626 --> 00:36:42.368]  You know what, I need to just walk through each one of these pieces of information.
[00:36:42.368 --> 00:36:43.089]  There's Iran.
[00:36:43.089 --> 00:36:45.470]  There's the oil spill.
[00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:48.332]  There's the police state.
[00:36:48.332 --> 00:36:56.297]  There is the monetary situation.
[00:36:56.297 --> 00:37:00.340]  And I'm just going to go over it all very slowly here.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.142]  And why should I have to shoot special YouTube videos
[00:37:04.244 --> 00:37:17.571]  Of what I'm about to say, because I've noticed if I do it on the radio show or it's just cut up pieces at PrisonPlanet.tv of the live simulcast we do every day, that it doesn't get the same impact.
[00:37:17.571 --> 00:37:28.417]  If I go out in a hallway and have somebody with a webcam shoot a video of me talking about something, the same thing I see on the radio, it might end up getting a million views.
[00:37:30.273 --> 00:37:38.915]  But when I say it here on the radio, it's heard by maybe a million people at the time, and then later, a few hundred thousand more, and that's it.
[00:37:38.915 --> 00:37:41.876]  And if we post it on YouTube, maybe 10,000 people.
[00:37:41.876 --> 00:37:48.098]  But if I go and do it outside the studio, people recognize, oh, this is something different, different background, and they pay attention to it.
[00:37:48.098 --> 00:37:52.639]  And I realize more and more, everything that's happening is profound.
[00:37:52.639 --> 00:37:55.420]  Everything that's going on is incredible.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.260]  I can't sleep.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.901]  I got up at 3.30 this morning.
[00:37:57.901 --> 00:37:58.901]  Went to bed at about midnight.
[00:38:01.594 --> 00:38:03.695]  I am troubled in my spirit.
[00:38:03.695 --> 00:38:05.456]  I am troubled in my psyche.
[00:38:05.456 --> 00:38:08.718]  I am troubled in my intellectual outlook.
[00:38:08.718 --> 00:38:09.638]  Can't you feel it?
[00:38:09.638 --> 00:38:12.800]  Don't you know the world's about to get a hundred times crazier?
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:24.166]  You think all the wild bizarreness that's happened is anything compared to what's coming?
[00:38:24.166 --> 00:38:27.368]  All right, let me just pause for a moment and collect myself and then I'm gonna
[00:38:29.161 --> 00:38:38.328]  I'm going to try to, as focused as I can, go through this.
[00:38:38.328 --> 00:38:46.735]  Let me start here with what's happened at the G20 slash G8 in Canada.
[00:38:46.735 --> 00:38:52.860]  There have been unbelievable new developments and I'm going to cover those, but first I want to set the foundation of what's happened in the last four or five days.
[00:38:54.659 --> 00:38:58.000]  At a cost of now over 1.2 billion.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.463]  It was half a billion, then 800 million, then 900 million, then a billion, then a billion two.
[00:39:03.463 --> 00:39:07.084]  Now they're saying it's gonna be over a billion two.
[00:39:07.084 --> 00:39:12.987]  And lawsuits are also gonna cost tens of millions.
[00:39:12.987 --> 00:39:14.827]  So we're talking over 1,200,000,000.
[00:39:14.827 --> 00:39:21.110]  That is very close to the yearly budget of Toronto.
[00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.571]  That's bigger than the budget of the city of Austin, Texas.
[00:39:24.807 --> 00:39:30.152]  For three official days, and then several days of aftermath.
[00:39:30.152 --> 00:39:40.502]  For the security for the heads of the private central banks, the G20, that control the Treasury Departments of our nations.
[00:39:40.502 --> 00:39:42.804]  And these meetings are public and private.
[00:39:42.804 --> 00:39:45.347]  They have public versions and then secret versions.
[00:39:45.347 --> 00:39:47.849]  And the criminals openly get together and cut deals.
[00:39:48.752 --> 00:39:51.895]  We've had four-year requests in Canada and the U.S.
[00:39:51.895 --> 00:39:58.021]  with North American Union, SPP, G20 meetings, and we covered this in my film, Endgame.
[00:39:58.021 --> 00:39:59.463]  At these meetings, they talk about, hey,
[00:40:00.694 --> 00:40:04.095]  We've got to get carbon taxes to fund our new global SDR.
[00:40:04.095 --> 00:40:06.856]  We're going to set up a world government run by private banks.
[00:40:06.856 --> 00:40:09.377]  We're going to take over the water supplies, the food supplies.
[00:40:09.377 --> 00:40:14.699]  We're going to do this to destroy industrialized society and make huge profits for ourselves.
[00:40:14.699 --> 00:40:19.280]  The corporate chiefs at the meetings tell the government officials what to do.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.041]  I mean, this is the real Congress.
[00:40:21.781 --> 00:40:25.302]  The World Government Criminal Congress.
[00:40:25.302 --> 00:40:36.987]  And that's why when the true Global Government Congress or Parliament, you can call it whatever you want, the Mafia Commission, comes to your city, Pittsburgh, or your city, Toronto, or your city of London, they kill people.
[00:40:36.987 --> 00:40:39.668]  Remember the newspaper delivery person?
[00:40:39.668 --> 00:40:42.509]  Had the special little passes and everything?
[00:40:42.509 --> 00:40:48.651]  Cops walk up and say, you can't go in that convenience store by the bank.
[00:40:48.651 --> 00:40:50.092]  He said, okay, well, I'm just delivering
[00:40:51.926 --> 00:40:53.047]  Newspapers, but okay.
[00:40:53.047 --> 00:40:53.967]  He turned around.
[00:40:53.967 --> 00:40:55.508]  Cop didn't like it.
[00:40:55.508 --> 00:40:56.889]  Wasn't enough that he submitted.
[00:40:56.889 --> 00:40:57.890]  So they murdered him.
[00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.891]  They beat him to death.
[00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:03.613]  The good news is, in England, they've charged the cops with manslaughter, at least.
[00:41:03.613 --> 00:41:05.594]  Because there's... We are in Soviet Russia.
[00:41:05.594 --> 00:41:06.815]  We are in Nazi Germany.
[00:41:06.815 --> 00:41:09.757]  We are in Pol Pot's Cambodia if they don't charge them.
[00:41:11.095 --> 00:41:12.355]  And most of the time, they cover it up.
[00:41:12.355 --> 00:41:22.579]  But the point is, the police tried to lie, they tried to have a fake coroner's inquest, then videos got released, the police seized them, and other police then said, I'm not gonna lie, they murdered him.
[00:41:22.579 --> 00:41:24.600]  And they just beat him to death for fun.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.521]  I am a human being.
[00:41:26.521 --> 00:41:32.463]  And so is Charlie Veitch, but I'm gonna get to his arrest in a moment.
[00:41:32.463 --> 00:41:35.544]  And so, you have two days, there's no violence, and then,
[00:41:36.738 --> 00:41:49.786]  Clearly military types, or police types, and the Royal Mounted Police have been caught attacking their own officers in Ottawa two and a half years ago, and that's national news.
[00:41:49.786 --> 00:41:57.952]  So to say that they look like cops and act like cops and the riot police stand down as the people burn a police car,
[00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:00.798]  Uh, wearing Nike apparel.
[00:42:00.798 --> 00:42:02.059]  No anarchists would ever wear Nike.
[00:42:02.059 --> 00:42:04.280]  That's the number one group they protest.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.342]  Uh, I mean, it's totally fake.
[00:42:06.342 --> 00:42:12.367]  The real rat-like anarchists that I've seen at these events that are real are drugged out of their minds.
[00:42:12.367 --> 00:42:18.132]  They're, uh, trust fund kids, and they're all got communist tattoos.
[00:42:18.132 --> 00:42:19.873]  They're walking contradiction.
[00:42:19.873 --> 00:42:21.755]  They're communist anarchists.
[00:42:21.755 --> 00:42:23.416]  Or leftist anarchists.
[00:42:23.416 --> 00:42:24.377]  I've seen that term.
[00:42:24.377 --> 00:42:25.498]  No such thing!
[00:42:25.498 --> 00:42:25.658]  Okay?
[00:42:27.196 --> 00:42:34.264]  That's like saying you are a... I don't know.
[00:42:34.264 --> 00:42:36.206]  It's like saying the sun is the moon.
[00:42:36.206 --> 00:42:38.629]  It's like saying water is fire.
[00:42:38.629 --> 00:42:40.011]  It's like saying dirt is air.
[00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:41.032]  I mean, it's not.
[00:42:41.032 --> 00:42:41.653]  It's the opposite.
[00:42:42.568 --> 00:42:44.889]  It's like saying up is down, down is up.
[00:42:44.889 --> 00:42:50.490]  It just shows how these are cops or they're private contractors or Delta Force types.
[00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:59.653]  They probably, they've got the build and the bearing of, if I had to make a guess, they're probably deep cover, former Canadian Special Forces.
[00:42:59.653 --> 00:43:00.673]  But who knows?
[00:43:00.673 --> 00:43:02.774]  These are multinational operations.
[00:43:04.741 --> 00:43:14.645]  And of course they have snatch and grabs, and only a few snatch and grabs where an unmarked car pulls up and grabs people and drags them away, unmarked men in uniforms or in plain clothes.
[00:43:14.645 --> 00:43:25.130]  Now it's people in shorts and t-shirts beating people up and dragging them into vans for intimidation to say, look, we throw a bag over your head and you just disappear into a black hole.
[00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:30.332]  Like this is the streets of Zimbabwe or something.
[00:43:31.778 --> 00:43:39.723]  I mean, getting grabbed and having a bag thrown over your head by plainclothes men and being thrown in a black van, that is the ultimate evil.
[00:43:39.723 --> 00:43:44.806]  I mean, if I had to give one definition of tyranny, that's it.
[00:43:44.806 --> 00:43:51.150]  And so the police, the media, everyone is being trained that even reporters are knocked on the head and drugged in and thrown into vans.
[00:43:52.196 --> 00:44:00.541]  And the images of police helping, and then the police chief of Toronto came out two weeks ago and said, well, we're gonna have private security contractors engaging in arrest.
[00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:02.222]  A special law has been passed.
[00:44:02.222 --> 00:44:06.165]  Well, now the newspapers decided to read the law, not in there.
[00:44:06.165 --> 00:44:07.686]  It was totally illegal.
[00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:09.527]  But see, that's the precedent they want.
[00:44:09.527 --> 00:44:11.288]  They set a precedent of lying.
[00:44:11.288 --> 00:44:15.030]  They set a precedent of deceit.
[00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.651]  So all of this is going on.
[00:44:16.651 --> 00:44:17.712]  All of that is happening.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.542]  And beating up London Guardian reporters for no reason.
[00:44:22.542 --> 00:44:26.323]  And beating up CTV and CBC reporters.
[00:44:26.323 --> 00:44:35.528]  I mean, these are national news crews and Toronto Police went up to big camera crews with TV reporters they know and beat the daylights out of them.
[00:44:35.528 --> 00:44:36.769]  I mean, they're letting everybody know, look!
[00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:38.510]  We own things.
[00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.771]  We got 1.2 billion to do this.
[00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:44.073]  We are now mafia, and they're all showing off to each other.
[00:44:44.073 --> 00:44:45.934]  It is the ultimate cowardice.
[00:44:45.934 --> 00:44:55.839]  You militarize police, but the police aren't facing some pillbox with hardened troops in it with grenade launchers and machine guns and bazookas.
[00:44:55.839 --> 00:45:03.503]  No, it's not men charging men in bloody ditches in hand-to-hand combat with daggers and guts hanging out.
[00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:15.860]  No, no, this is men playing the part of warriors with their arms way out to their sides like some type of rooster walking up and beating up little women and 10-year-old kids.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.643]  I mean, this is the quintessential cowardice.
[00:45:18.643 --> 00:45:22.146]  And let me tell you something, as a man, you make me ashamed to be a man.
[00:45:22.146 --> 00:45:24.729]  I would be ashamed to be you.
[00:45:27.329 --> 00:45:36.231]  There's something shameful, I don't know, even when some big guy starts a fight with you and you beat the hell out of them and they're on the ground and people are trying to wake them up and blood's coming out their ears.
[00:45:36.231 --> 00:45:41.292]  I've felt ashamed in my life when I've defended myself at the end of it.
[00:45:41.292 --> 00:45:44.253]  You don't feel ashamed when you're beating up a woman or a child.
[00:45:44.253 --> 00:45:52.475]  You sit there and get off on it because you're cowards, you're weak, you're pathetic, you're real tough and all your body armor beating up a London Guardian reporter.
[00:45:53.652 --> 00:45:59.496]  And as soon as you take on that culture of evil, how many people have the RNCP killed?
[00:45:59.496 --> 00:46:01.538]  How many people have their customs killed?
[00:46:01.538 --> 00:46:04.580]  The Canadians are the worst I've ever seen.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.883]  How many people have they killed in their airport?
[00:46:07.883 --> 00:46:19.892]  Oh, you're some mentally retarded Polish kid, you're 25 years old, totally retarded with special papers, flying for your mother to pick you up, your elderly mother, and you're for 18 hours locked up,
[00:46:20.712 --> 00:46:27.657]  You know, behind glass, and they won't get somebody to speak your language, and you start arguing, so you throw a chair, throwing a fit.
[00:46:27.657 --> 00:46:35.644]  They went in and jumped on his head, and stomped on his head, and broke his neck, and then told the public, oh, he accidentally died, even though the coroner said they broke his neck.
[00:46:35.644 --> 00:46:36.985]  And the cops didn't get in trouble.
[00:46:36.985 --> 00:46:41.288]  And the cops said, hey, we can murder retarded kids now.
[00:46:41.288 --> 00:46:46.832]  We can take some poor retarded person and break their neck, because we're real tough.
[00:46:46.832 --> 00:46:47.873]  We're real men.
[00:46:47.873 --> 00:46:48.994]  Let me tell you something, cops.
[00:46:49.949 --> 00:46:53.614]  You're helping bring in an evil that your family's gonna live under.
[00:46:53.614 --> 00:46:55.656]  I want you to remember that.
[00:46:55.656 --> 00:46:57.519]  But you're too stupid to even recognize it.
[00:46:57.519 --> 00:46:58.340]  You don't even care.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.501]  So good!
[00:46:59.501 --> 00:47:01.223]  God will give you what you want.
[00:47:01.223 --> 00:47:03.847]  You bring the curse upon yourself and your family and your name.
[00:47:06.087 --> 00:47:07.608]  I know a lot of police email me and write me.
[00:47:07.608 --> 00:47:09.389]  They're ashamed of it when they see it as well.
[00:47:09.389 --> 00:47:18.095]  And this is evil government recruiting scum to the top where the commanders tell their people and incite them to engage in war crimes against us.
[00:47:18.095 --> 00:47:19.836]  They are waging war against us.
[00:47:19.836 --> 00:47:24.979]  Now, the list of crimes goes on and on, but Charlie,
[00:47:26.803 --> 00:47:43.059]  Vieth and others were inside the Toronto film studios in these little high-tech cages with lights on them and cameras over the toilet and being strip-searched four times as part of humiliation and being laughed at.
[00:47:44.963 --> 00:48:02.601]  It's one thing if you got a strip search somebody but to get off on it and you know laugh at them and and we told you TSA workers keep making fun of men's genitals and women's genitals and now what there's been three cases of TSA workers beating each other up because bosses make their employees go through and then laugh at their at their at their male member.
[00:48:03.422 --> 00:48:05.223]  And say, look at your tiny, you know what?
[00:48:05.223 --> 00:48:06.903]  I mean, that's now Associated Press.
[00:48:06.903 --> 00:48:08.804]  I mean, this is the people they're hiring, folks.
[00:48:08.804 --> 00:48:17.186]  They, I mean, this is, can you imagine as a man wanting to look at a woman's breast without her permission?
[00:48:17.186 --> 00:48:19.687]  I don't, I mean, the whole thing is about the woman wanting you.
[00:48:19.687 --> 00:48:20.887]  And maybe I don't want them.
[00:48:20.887 --> 00:48:25.488]  You know, maybe I particularly want one woman.
[00:48:25.488 --> 00:48:27.729]  You know, sex is a very important, special thing.
[00:48:29.258 --> 00:48:31.100]  But whatever happened to modesty and decency?
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:35.763]  I mean, do you want your mother, your daughter being treated like that, you jackass?
[00:48:35.763 --> 00:48:51.196]  And over and over again, it's even been on the news, even when they show the airport footage on CBS and ABC, it'll show them smiling as some beautiful woman is in the body scanner, and the guys are all sitting around pointing and laughing, and they admittedly do this?
[00:48:51.196 --> 00:48:55.500]  And so they're laughing at everybody and videotaping their genitals?
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.580]  So we know that was going on.
[00:48:57.683 --> 00:48:59.381]  And now, respected reporter.
[00:49:01.658 --> 00:49:09.282]  Says that while she was in there, inside the same facility, that they were telling women, we're going to rape you.
[00:49:09.282 --> 00:49:10.643]  We're going to rape you.
[00:49:10.643 --> 00:49:12.904]  We're going to put you in a cell where you're going to get raped.
[00:49:12.904 --> 00:49:14.865]  And they would strip search them over and over again.
[00:49:14.865 --> 00:49:21.128]  And remember that famous video of the males, men strip searching the woman as she screams and cries, and they're grabbing her breasts and her genitals?
[00:49:21.128 --> 00:49:24.350]  In fact, guys, will you YouTube a police strip search woman?
[00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:28.872]  There's a bunch of them, but the one where she's just screaming and begging, and you hear them getting off on it?
[00:49:28.872 --> 00:49:29.553]  We're going to play that.
[00:49:30.826 --> 00:49:37.648]  And then they reportedly started shoving their hands into the women, the men, and that's a form of rape.
[00:49:37.648 --> 00:49:45.510]  So now in Canada, and I believe this report, I've seen these monsters, now men, imagine, they get the woman, they spread her legs.
[00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:50.152]  I'm gonna play this, I'm gonna play this audio coming up and children shouldn't listen.
[00:49:50.152 --> 00:49:51.212]  And they just, they just...
[00:49:52.032 --> 00:49:53.893]  Rape them with their hands.
[00:49:53.893 --> 00:49:56.293]  And this is who they are.
[00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:59.554]  And by the way, when I was in high school, we actually moved to Austin.
[00:49:59.554 --> 00:50:03.695]  One of the main reasons was because I discovered the police were dealing drugs.
[00:50:03.695 --> 00:50:06.696]  And I began to talk about it when they would have drug raids at the school.
[00:50:06.696 --> 00:50:08.356]  I said, well, you guys deal the drugs.
[00:50:08.356 --> 00:50:09.157]  Everybody knows that.
[00:50:09.157 --> 00:50:11.957]  I've been at a party when you deliver drugs.
[00:50:11.957 --> 00:50:16.999]  And so they called me into the office and they said, we're going to plant stereo equipment on you and we'll hang you in the cell.
[00:50:16.999 --> 00:50:20.940]  And then they found out we were moving and the cops
[00:50:22.472 --> 00:50:34.408]  My last day at high school, before we moved, the cop called me over to his police car in the parking lot and he said, uh, you're a criminal and you're gonna end up in prison and black men are gonna rape you in the you-know-what and pump AIDS into you.
[00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:36.788]  And he goes, I know you're moving to Austin.
[00:50:36.788 --> 00:50:39.910]  I'm going to give them word down there and they're going to rape you and give you AIDS.
[00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:45.853]  So I know that's a special cop thing about, but they said, we're going to rape you and we're going to let others rape you and we're going to give you AIDS.
[00:50:45.853 --> 00:50:48.095]  And so that's what they do to journalists now.
[00:50:48.095 --> 00:50:52.978]  And they take their hands and wrap them inside the women, just like in New York with that toilet plunger.
[00:50:52.978 --> 00:50:57.721]  And they lied about that for hours, blood squirting out, raping them with a toilet plunger.
[00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:58.941]  That's protected murder.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:09.887]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:51:09.887 --> 00:51:13.450]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:23.038]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:28.282]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[00:51:28.582 --> 00:51:31.065]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent.
[00:51:31.065 --> 00:51:42.056]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.
[00:51:42.056 --> 00:51:44.039]  With absolutely no apologies.
[00:51:44.039 --> 00:51:48.663]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[00:51:48.663 --> 00:51:49.124]  That's right.
[00:51:49.264 --> 00:51:49.664]  We're good.
[00:52:05.226 --> 00:52:06.487]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:06.487 --> 00:52:10.230]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:12.652]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.652 --> 00:52:18.538]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:52:18.538 --> 00:52:24.763]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:25.183 --> 00:52:31.164]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:31.164 --> 00:52:35.345]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:35.345 --> 00:52:39.626]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:39.626 --> 00:52:45.587]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.587 --> 00:52:49.127]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:49.127 --> 00:52:51.108]  The police state isn't coming.

[00:54:14.537 --> 00:54:24.186]  I mean, how many times have we heard about police in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Malice China, Pol Pots, Cambodia, Fidel's Cuba, raping women?
[00:54:24.186 --> 00:54:25.627]  Well, we know that's part of it.
[00:54:25.627 --> 00:54:27.529]  How many times to occupying armies?
[00:54:27.529 --> 00:54:38.639]  You know, our troops were known for not being really bad about atrocities, but in the annals of World War II, our troops, you know, raped women.
[00:54:40.421 --> 00:54:43.963]  That's what happens in these mob psychology situations.
[00:54:43.963 --> 00:54:51.886]  And that's why if you militarize police and teach them that they're fighting an enemy, the people, well, they just start egging each other on.
[00:54:51.886 --> 00:54:58.890]  And the reports are that they were having male officers
[00:55:00.006 --> 00:55:03.308]  Of course, it's just an examination, kind of like Dr. Mingala.
[00:55:03.308 --> 00:55:06.389]  Oh, this is just going to be an examination, very professional.
[00:55:06.389 --> 00:55:08.731]  It's like something out of Hellraiser.
[00:55:08.731 --> 00:55:12.153]  The doctor will see you now.
[00:55:12.153 --> 00:55:16.475]  Will G20 police succeed in covering up reports of rape and torture?
[00:55:18.919 --> 00:55:19.939]  That's right, my friends.
[00:55:19.939 --> 00:55:23.200]  And it does turn out that their 5 meter law was a lie.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.500]  Mail and Globe.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:28.081]  That their emergency power secret arrest law was a fraud.
[00:55:28.081 --> 00:55:30.022]  That is all over the newspapers.
[00:55:30.022 --> 00:55:32.242]  Here's a G20 security fence.
[00:55:32.242 --> 00:55:33.523]  5 meter rule never existed.
[00:55:33.523 --> 00:55:37.364]  I mean, they'll lie about anything.
[00:55:37.364 --> 00:55:43.425]  UK man arrested for impersonating officer prior to G20, Charlie Veith.
[00:55:43.425 --> 00:55:45.026]  He's got a court date coming up today.
[00:55:45.026 --> 00:55:46.466]  We're gonna give you a report on that.
[00:55:49.329 --> 00:55:53.570]  But will G20 police succeed in covering up reports of rape and torture?
[00:55:53.570 --> 00:56:10.575]  There are now multiple blogs, Independent Media Center, and other very credible organizations saying that they were strip-searched over and over again as a form of torture, that men would do it, and that they would also force their fingers inside the women.
[00:56:10.575 --> 00:56:12.056]  And they're lucky it wasn't a toilet plunger.
[00:56:13.096 --> 00:56:14.136]  Uh, like in New York City.
[00:56:14.136 --> 00:56:17.037]  Remember, oh, that wasn't true for a year.
[00:56:17.037 --> 00:56:17.878]  Oh, it's not true.
[00:56:17.878 --> 00:56:21.519]  Uh, the officers didn't do that, and finally the cops went public and said, yeah.
[00:56:21.519 --> 00:56:22.359]  And it was incredible.
[00:56:22.359 --> 00:56:28.701]  How could the commander that made the cops hold the guy down, it said for two hours he did it?
[00:56:28.701 --> 00:56:33.222]  I mean, how could you stay angry enough, even if you could do that to somebody who'd say killed your kids?
[00:56:33.222 --> 00:56:34.323]  How could you do it for hours?
[00:56:34.323 --> 00:56:35.663]  Just, I'll show you.
[00:56:35.663 --> 00:56:38.144]  No, this was a demonic worm.
[00:56:38.144 --> 00:56:41.785]  Let's go ahead and play this reporter's, uh, information.
[00:56:43.148 --> 00:56:47.211]  Let's go ahead and play this reporter and what she had to say about being inside.
[00:56:47.211 --> 00:56:50.694]  Journalist, Toronto Police sexually molested women at G20.
[00:56:50.694 --> 00:56:52.175]  Independent journalist, Amy Miller.
[00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:52.836]  Here it is.
[00:56:52.836 --> 00:56:54.177]  My name is Amy Miller.
[00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:57.920]  I was detained yesterday at approximately noon.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.702]  I was with Adam as well as one other colleague.
[00:57:00.702 --> 00:57:03.565]  We were on our way to cover the jail solidarity action.
[00:57:04.766 --> 00:57:15.957]  On the way on Bloor near Bay, we stopped because we saw a group of young people being detained and being searched so we wanted to see what was happening.
[00:57:15.957 --> 00:57:21.463]  As Adam recounted, he was quickly taken down and the same thing happened to me.
[00:57:21.463 --> 00:57:23.685]  I was throttled at the neck and held down.
[00:57:24.666 --> 00:57:27.748]  And then I was detained for nearly 13 hours.
[00:57:27.748 --> 00:57:39.094]  I was placed in a cell at the Toronto Film Studio and I was in a cell with 25 other young women for approximately 13 hours.
[00:57:39.094 --> 00:57:42.836]  Throughout the time that I was detained, I was told many
[00:57:44.117 --> 00:57:44.638]  We're good to go.
[00:58:01.909 --> 00:58:14.704]  When I was in the detention center, I saw numerous young women who were completely strip-searched, who were strip-searched by male officers.
[00:58:14.704 --> 00:58:20.371]  And one young woman, when she was coming out, who was completely traumatized, said that she had had a finger put up her.
[00:58:21.392 --> 00:58:37.277]  And I find this completely unacceptable, and I hope that people will investigate this, because from what I saw in the cell, from the women who were coming out, who were being strip searched, they were definitely traumatized, and there was very much violence that was targeted to young women.
[00:58:37.277 --> 00:58:42.578]  While I was detained... Oh yeah, the better looking, the more they attack them.
[00:58:42.578 --> 00:58:45.199]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.762 --> 00:58:53.785]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:53.785 --> 00:58:59.110]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:59.110 --> 00:59:01.152]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:01.152 --> 00:59:06.157]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.157 --> 00:59:07.359]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:08.480]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:10.361]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:11.443]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.443 --> 00:59:13.645]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:13.645 --> 00:59:14.686]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:14.946 --> 00:59:16.487]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.487 --> 00:59:21.749]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:21.749 --> 00:59:25.331]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.331 --> 00:59:29.153]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.153 --> 00:59:30.393]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.393 --> 00:59:31.294]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.294 --> 00:59:32.394]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.394 --> 00:59:33.315]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.315 --> 00:59:34.135]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.415 --> 00:59:37.458]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.458 --> 00:59:37.979]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:37.979 --> 00:59:39.700]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:40.681]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:40.681 --> 00:59:41.862]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:41.862 --> 00:59:43.704]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.407 --> 01:00:10.230]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:11.831]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.831 --> 01:00:13.372]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.372 --> 01:00:17.574]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.574 --> 01:00:21.636]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.392]  My friends, I am just dumbfounded.
[01:00:36.392 --> 01:00:41.376]  I want to believe in the police who've been militarized and turned against us worldwide.
[01:00:41.376 --> 01:00:43.718]  I want to believe they wouldn't follow illegal orders.
[01:00:43.718 --> 01:00:56.367]  I wanted to believe in Denver that the police weren't dressed up like anarchists attacking their own officers to demonize the peaceful protesters, but it came out in the Denver Post because the police department was forced to admit it was true.
[01:00:56.367 --> 01:00:57.808]  It came out in the Toronto Star.
[01:00:59.008 --> 01:01:00.449]  They've done this over and over again.
[01:01:00.449 --> 01:01:02.991]  I mean, they've been caught on national news in Greece.
[01:01:02.991 --> 01:01:08.095]  The police knocking out windows and burning buildings to blame it on the anti-bank activist.
[01:01:08.095 --> 01:01:11.477]  Our media keeps calling all the anti-bank people communist.
[01:01:11.477 --> 01:01:17.021]  The bankers are the ones that are funding communism to take your wealth and give it to themselves.
[01:01:17.021 --> 01:01:23.066]  And now, will G20 police succeed in covering up report of rape and torture?
[01:01:23.066 --> 01:01:25.707]  You just heard me play a clip of a reporter talking about
[01:01:26.673 --> 01:01:30.355]  Now the police told her, she saw them beating people, so she was covering it.
[01:01:30.355 --> 01:01:32.056]  They arrested her and another journalist.
[01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:33.857]  Once they got her there, they said, we're going to rape you.
[01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:37.339]  We're going to have other people rape you.
[01:01:37.339 --> 01:01:41.000]  And I remember my one experience with police threatening to have me raped.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.463]  Well, I've had two experiences as a juvenile.
[01:01:45.463 --> 01:01:46.783]  First Nations has just joined us.
[01:01:46.783 --> 01:01:46.984]  I was 16.
[01:01:49.171 --> 01:01:59.096]  And I didn't do drugs, but I went to parties, and I knew people, you know, a lot of people did, and I'd seen sheriff's deputies and others deliver drugs.
[01:01:59.096 --> 01:01:59.977]  And I was shocked by it.
[01:01:59.977 --> 01:02:02.939]  By the time I was 12, I'd seen it, just in the neighborhood.
[01:02:02.939 --> 01:02:14.405]  I'd be over at a friend's house after playing baseball, drinking Kool-Aid, or Capri Sun, and, you know, I'd see a sheriff's car pull up, and they'd be with a guy's older brother, and I'd say, what was he doing?
[01:02:14.405 --> 01:02:16.526]  Oh, my brother gets drugs from him and sells it.
[01:02:18.217 --> 01:02:20.779]  And of course, you know, the big brother was the coolest guy in the school.
[01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:23.941]  I mean, he literally had all the cheerleaders, football, everything.
[01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:25.462]  Nobody suspected the preppy guy.
[01:02:25.462 --> 01:02:28.244]  And so it was the cool house to hang around.
[01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:32.587]  You know, you'd be 12 years old watching the 17-year-old cheerleader and they just looked like Marilyn Monroe to a 12-year-old.
[01:02:34.088 --> 01:02:36.069]  And I just, you know, I just saw the right things.
[01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:39.591]  You know, I was in the right place at the right time, or the wrong place at the wrong time, depending on your perspective.
[01:02:39.591 --> 01:02:41.672]  I think it was the right place at the right time.
[01:02:41.672 --> 01:02:44.613]  And so, they'd have weird drug testing at the school, and D.A.R.E.
[01:02:44.613 --> 01:03:00.501]  programs, and everybody would swear up and down that they weren't going to use drugs, they'd have drug dogs, and they'd call us in the auditorium and tell us not to use drugs, and I'd be looking at cops I knew were involved in drugs in the auditorium giving speeches.
[01:03:00.501 --> 01:03:01.962]  And I just would tell people, you know,
[01:03:02.742 --> 01:03:08.065]  One time, cops pulled me over and I had a six-pack of Coors Light, and I said, you know, I know your guys are involved in drugs.
[01:03:08.065 --> 01:03:10.606]  You're going to take me to jail for this beer?
[01:03:10.606 --> 01:03:12.727]  And they said, you bet we are, Jones!
[01:03:12.727 --> 01:03:13.928]  You're going to get hung in your cell.
[01:03:13.928 --> 01:03:15.468]  You ought to watch your butt!
[01:03:15.468 --> 01:03:19.070]  That was, you know, back in the, like, 1990.
[01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:21.471]  So they didn't, nobody had cameras or recorders back then.
[01:03:21.471 --> 01:03:30.396]  And then, like I said, the last day of school, because my parents heard about it, the police contacted the local lawyer.
[01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:38.783]  And the message was given and the lawyer told my dad, you know, people hang themselves in Rockwall County.
[01:03:38.783 --> 01:03:42.463]  There've been a lot of deaths in the jail and you're best get out of town.
[01:03:42.463 --> 01:03:44.744]  And my dad was like, you know what?
[01:03:44.744 --> 01:03:46.524]  He was already selling his dental office.
[01:03:46.524 --> 01:03:47.724]  He was going to start another one in Dallas.
[01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:49.645]  He's my mom always wanted to move back to Austin.
[01:03:49.645 --> 01:03:51.105]  That's where she's from.
[01:03:51.105 --> 01:03:53.226]  We said, let's just go to Austin.
[01:03:53.226 --> 01:03:59.647]  But there was the cop waiting the last day, my last day of school.
[01:03:59.647 --> 01:04:00.087]  And, uh,
[01:04:02.196 --> 01:04:06.439]  There I was and he pulled up and he said, Alex, you're leaving.
[01:04:06.439 --> 01:04:07.740]  And he said, but we're going to get you.
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:14.906]  You're going to be put in prison when a big black man, he said, a big N-word is going to rape you and give you AIDS.
[01:04:14.906 --> 01:04:17.407]  And he said, we're going to get you.
[01:04:17.407 --> 01:04:22.031]  And I just said, well, I said, okay.
[01:04:22.031 --> 01:04:26.815]  And I couldn't tell if it was a bluff or what it was, but he said, we'll, we'll let them know down in Austin you're coming.
[01:04:26.815 --> 01:04:29.897]  A criminal like you never gets away with it for long.
[01:04:35.165 --> 01:04:41.447]  And that guy was one of the cops at the school.
[01:04:41.447 --> 01:04:48.189]  And he owned a bar locally, I guess, to cover up where his money came from.
[01:04:48.189 --> 01:04:49.090]  That's who they are.
[01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:49.790]  They run everything.
[01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:51.331]  They're the mafia.
[01:04:51.331 --> 01:04:53.651]  The media teaches you to worship.
[01:04:53.651 --> 01:04:57.453]  Worship at the feet of a group that's turning into total devils.
[01:04:57.453 --> 01:04:58.033]  That's a fact.
[01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:05.254]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:05:05.254 --> 01:05:06.234]  What have we got?
[01:05:06.234 --> 01:05:08.696]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:09.697]  A republic.
[01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:12.339]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:05:12.339 --> 01:05:14.621]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:05:14.621 --> 01:05:16.642]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:05:16.642 --> 01:05:18.323]  So they think they own our land?
[01:05:18.323 --> 01:05:19.624]  They think they own our water?
[01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:20.245]  Children?
[01:05:20.245 --> 01:05:21.366]  Our education?
[01:05:21.366 --> 01:05:22.186]  Our money?
[01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:25.849]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:05:26.209 --> 01:05:31.174]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:05:31.174 --> 01:05:32.215]  We have the facts.
[01:05:32.215 --> 01:05:33.356]  We have the Constitution.
[01:05:33.356 --> 01:05:34.277]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:05:34.277 --> 01:05:35.158]  We have common law.
[01:05:35.158 --> 01:05:37.680]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.464]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:05:41.564 --> 01:05:46.530]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:48.012]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:49.113]  Don't tread on me.

[01:06:59.898 --> 01:07:04.081]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:07:04.081 --> 01:07:10.486]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:07:10.486 --> 01:07:17.872]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:07:17.872 --> 01:07:22.755]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:07:31.405 --> 01:07:35.131]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:07:35.666 --> 01:07:42.427]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:07:42.427 --> 01:07:46.308]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:07:46.308 --> 01:07:52.410]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:52.830]  Thank you.
[01:08:02.273 --> 01:08:08.894]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.894 --> 01:08:12.435]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.435 --> 01:08:28.899]  I'm going to cover the latest developments in the Gulf, both the Gulf of Mexico and the Persian Gulf, as things heat up.
[01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:30.239]  I mean, every day we're just...
[01:08:31.275 --> 01:08:50.466]  Inching towards war with Iran, and there's a psychological effect I've noticed that if you've been hearing about how there's going to be war with Iraq for 13 years, from 1990-91 until 2003, even if you're against war, you almost expect it to happen.
[01:08:50.466 --> 01:08:52.627]  It's kind of like, well let's get it over with.
[01:08:53.956 --> 01:08:54.576]  And they know that.
[01:08:54.576 --> 01:08:57.778]  They just wear you out, always gearing up for it.
[01:08:57.778 --> 01:08:59.640]  But now, the stars have aligned.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:05.883]  Now, all the evidence says they are moving in the next week, the next month, the next year.
[01:09:05.883 --> 01:09:07.004]  The green light has been given.
[01:09:07.004 --> 01:09:12.488]  We don't know when the hammer's gonna drop, but right now, I'd say it's about a 90% chance they're gonna hit Iran.
[01:09:13.248 --> 01:09:14.308]  The decision has been made.
[01:09:14.308 --> 01:09:23.631]  They may retract it, or Iran may properly grovel, but they've got to agree to give BP, who formerly ran the country until 1953, all the oil.
[01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:26.832]  It's always BP, it's always Goldman Sachs, always the same players.
[01:09:26.832 --> 01:09:30.033]  It was Anglo-American oil previously.
[01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:35.875]  IranCo, they've had many names, but they are moving.
[01:09:37.662 --> 01:09:45.085]  And I don't think Iran will submit, and I don't think there's any way for them to submit, because every time they try to submit, the globalists just reintensify their operations.
[01:09:45.085 --> 01:09:54.228]  They need a new war, they need a political distraction, they need an excuse to move more forces into Central Asia to threaten Russia, and of course they've got a deal with China.
[01:09:54.228 --> 01:10:00.890]  We're also going to talk about the Russian spy situation coming up, but I do want to open the phones.
[01:10:01.954 --> 01:10:04.896]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the day.
[01:10:04.896 --> 01:10:15.905]  We're going to have Dan Dix from Press for Truth, a great reporter I've known for years, who worked with Charlie Veitch of the Love Police, British activist from Scotland.
[01:10:17.143 --> 01:10:34.009]  Uh, who's been arrested twice now, he's being charged with serious felony crimes, impersonating a police officer for calling himself the Love Police, getting smart-mouthed in one of the videos saying, oh yes, I'm an undercover that's gonna stage, you know, events for the police, you know, as you guys did here a few years ago.
[01:10:34.009 --> 01:10:37.130]  And so they're using that, and then him going, I'm an absurdist filmmaker.
[01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:39.771]  I mean, he's out there being sarcastic.
[01:10:39.771 --> 01:10:41.972]  And, uh, so they've gone and arrested him for that.
[01:10:43.732 --> 01:10:44.553]  Very, very serious.
[01:11:04.673 --> 01:11:09.637]  My two early experiences with police was I found out the police were dealing drugs in Rockwall.
[01:11:09.637 --> 01:11:11.218]  I didn't even go to the other police.
[01:11:11.218 --> 01:11:12.919]  I didn't call the media.
[01:11:12.919 --> 01:11:20.544]  I just would shoot my mouth off a couple times about, hey, I know you guys are involved in drugs because I'd seen it.
[01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:22.126]  I'd seen it.
[01:11:22.126 --> 01:11:26.509]  And they called me in the office and said, we're going to plant stolen stereo equipment on you.
[01:11:26.509 --> 01:11:30.632]  And I said, I'd never stolen anything but beer years ago out of a golf cart.
[01:11:31.613 --> 01:11:32.454]  And he goes, oh really?
[01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.334]  I'll have to look into that.
[01:11:33.334 --> 01:11:36.237]  You know, because you think you'll be honest with these people and it means anything.
[01:11:36.237 --> 01:11:36.797]  No, no, no, no.
[01:11:36.797 --> 01:11:38.258]  They're the bad guys.
[01:11:38.258 --> 01:11:40.240]  When they're bad, there's nothing worse than a bad cop.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.281]  And they're everywhere.
[01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:42.662]  Let's just be honest about that.
[01:11:42.662 --> 01:11:45.544]  There's a reason the media has all these cop shows about worshipping cops.
[01:11:45.544 --> 01:11:48.066]  There's a reason they're always cramming it down our throat.
[01:11:48.066 --> 01:11:51.209]  Because the truth is, the establishment's trying to make cops corrupt.
[01:11:51.886 --> 01:11:53.686]  I mean, it happens on its own easy enough.
[01:11:53.686 --> 01:11:55.387]  Anybody abuses power.
[01:11:55.387 --> 01:11:56.367]  That's just common sense.
[01:11:56.367 --> 01:11:58.167]  The founders taught us that.
[01:11:58.167 --> 01:12:03.729]  You take anybody and give them power, statistically, the majority of the time you're going to end up getting monsters on your hands.
[01:12:03.729 --> 01:12:07.309]  Then you get a bunch of monsters together and they start competing with each other.
[01:12:07.309 --> 01:12:13.591]  They start getting away with more and more, but side issue.
[01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:18.212]  In my few experiences with cops, you know, one time some big old redneck started to fight with me.
[01:12:19.677 --> 01:12:31.744]  And he got me down on the ground, so that was a problem, so I had to turn on the juice, turn on the can of you-know-what, and I got up and beat the daylights out of him, stomped him good, so I wouldn't have to keep fighting.
[01:12:31.744 --> 01:12:38.788]  And he was hurt real bad, and the cops showed up, and what were they supposed to do?
[01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:48.073]  One guy was unconscious, and people said, well, this big guy started the fight with the little guy, because I was a little guy, about 160 pounds back then when I was 15 years old, and they said, well, we're going to take you to jail.
[01:12:50.678 --> 01:12:52.079]  And I was there for three days.
[01:12:52.079 --> 01:12:55.922]  They put me in jail on a Friday, didn't get out till Monday in court.
[01:12:55.922 --> 01:12:57.063]  I've told the story before.
[01:12:57.063 --> 01:13:02.407]  It was at the Terrell Juvenile Detention Center.
[01:13:02.407 --> 01:13:06.890]  Two floors on top of the Terrell Courthouse.
[01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:09.552]  The city of Terrell, for whatever that county is.
[01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:13.135]  And this pot-bellied pervert came and said, it's time for you to take your shower.
[01:13:13.135 --> 01:13:13.895]  It's your shower time.
[01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:22.107]  Because he got let out for about an hour a day to take a shower, and then any extra time he could sit there and watch whatever was on the TV.
[01:13:22.107 --> 01:13:23.048]  He couldn't change the channel.
[01:13:23.048 --> 01:13:25.509]  So he was out for one hour a day.
[01:13:25.509 --> 01:13:31.632]  And he started getting in the shower, telling me I was good looking, and he wanted to take good care of me while I was there.
[01:13:31.632 --> 01:13:33.113]  And I said, listen, I'm not into this.
[01:13:33.113 --> 01:13:35.314]  And he said, well, shoved me and said, bend over.
[01:13:35.314 --> 01:13:39.916]  And I said, you may get away with this, but I'm going to go public and my dad's going to kill you.
[01:13:40.919 --> 01:13:42.641]  And he said, get out of here!
[01:13:42.641 --> 01:13:46.285]  You're not getting a shower or out for the next, so the next few days I wasn't out of there.
[01:13:47.242 --> 01:13:48.263]  I didn't get to get out of the cell.
[01:13:48.263 --> 01:13:50.724]  So that's what America's run by, okay?
[01:13:50.724 --> 01:13:53.166]  Perverts that want to rape... I think I was actually 14.
[01:13:53.166 --> 01:13:54.947]  I'm 14 or 15.
[01:13:54.947 --> 01:14:04.934]  And then, you know, you're 16, trying to leave the town because you know they're drug dealers and they're death-threatening you and they're, we're gonna put you in jail one day and black men are gonna rape you and give you AIDS.
[01:14:04.934 --> 01:14:06.315]  So I've experienced it.
[01:14:06.315 --> 01:14:08.717]  I don't... I mean, I know it goes on.
[01:14:08.717 --> 01:14:15.121]  I mean, who was the fellow in New York who got raped with the plunger till his guts came out?
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:16.940]  Remember that guy?
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:40.275]  All because, at a nightclub, somebody punched a cop, and so the cops waited outside and randomly arrested a bunch of people, and it turned out, they later got the footage, and he was not the one that had even punched the guy.
[01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:45.278]  And, I mean, we know this goes on.
[01:14:47.668 --> 01:15:01.696]  And now, at the G20, the police make up a law that doesn't exist and arrest over 600 innocent people, beat up London Guardian reporters, CTV, national television hosts, CBC.
[01:15:01.696 --> 01:15:09.160]  Yeah, Diallo was the guy.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:13.702]  23-year-old guy, an immigrant in New York City.
[01:15:13.702 --> 01:15:14.703]  He was shot and killed.
[01:15:16.371 --> 01:15:17.072]  That's another one.
[01:15:17.072 --> 01:15:23.576]  This is not the guy that got sodomized with a plunger.
[01:15:23.576 --> 01:15:25.757]  That's another one of the famous cases.
[01:15:25.757 --> 01:15:26.497]  And let me tell you something.
[01:15:26.497 --> 01:15:28.118]  I've been polite to New York cops.
[01:15:28.118 --> 01:15:30.020]  I've seen them be mean to old ladies.
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.421]  I've seen them be mean to families.
[01:15:31.421 --> 01:15:35.023]  I mean, they relish being mean to good people.
[01:15:35.023 --> 01:15:37.865]  They have hired a bunch of goons.
[01:15:37.865 --> 01:15:40.026]  They look like goons.
[01:15:40.026 --> 01:15:44.229]  Now, some of them are nice, but I'd say most of them are a bunch of power-tripping lunatics.
[01:15:45.254 --> 01:15:47.655]  And the issue is that's what the system wants.
[01:15:47.655 --> 01:15:53.076]  They want people that'll attack old ladies with a police dog in Pittsburgh as they come out of a grocery store with a bag.
[01:15:53.076 --> 01:15:54.897]  And they say, nobody's allowed on the streets.
[01:15:54.897 --> 01:15:57.717]  And the old lady's like, okay, officer, but I'm grocery shopping.
[01:15:57.717 --> 01:15:59.978]  And they release a German shepherd on her.
[01:15:59.978 --> 01:16:01.919]  That's what your tax money pays for.
[01:16:01.919 --> 01:16:11.741]  Your tax money goes to give tens of trillions of dollars to offshore banks that won't tell us where the money's gone so they can take over our entire financial system.
[01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:13.882]  And literally seize our entire infrastructure.
[01:16:14.735 --> 01:16:15.335]  We're good to go.
[01:16:37.677 --> 01:16:49.001]  So the big story here is, and I'm asking everybody to get this out to everyone they know, will G20 police succeed in covering up reports of rape and torture?
[01:16:51.451 --> 01:16:55.234]  Now Canada is officially the most oppressive and backward dictatorship in the West.
[01:16:55.234 --> 01:17:07.342]  Will authorities be allowed to cover up the Abu Ghraib style incarceration methods of Toronto police engaged in during the G20 summit this past weekend where women were arrested and subsequently raped by male cops?
[01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:20.573]  And by the way, under law, if you do rape someone with your hand, that's even in the Army report from Abu Ghraib, the Togumbo report, that it counts as rape under federal international law.
[01:17:20.573 --> 01:17:22.834]  They use flashlights there and it counted as rape.
[01:17:22.834 --> 01:17:27.098]  Penetration with any object is rape.
[01:17:27.098 --> 01:17:32.282]  It's not just molestation.
[01:17:32.282 --> 01:17:36.005]  It was Loima, Abner Loima, that got tortured with the
[01:17:40.811 --> 01:17:49.373]  Well, it just came out a few weeks ago that the cops lied because the video got released where they just beat some guy and pepper sprayed him and tasered him for no reason in a subway.
[01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:59.014]  I mean, where are the police unions decrying what happened in Toronto?
[01:17:59.014 --> 01:18:01.255]  No, they're going to back up their brothers.
[01:18:01.255 --> 01:18:03.615]  Their brother isn't freedom and liberty.
[01:18:03.615 --> 01:18:06.456]  No, their brother is that thug system.
[01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:08.419]  It's gang mentality.
[01:18:08.419 --> 01:18:19.927]  I mean, you can go find some crip or some blood or some Mexican mafia guy or some Aryan Nations, you know, prison gang person, and they'll kill, they'll lie, they'll steal, they'll do anything because of their brotherhood.
[01:18:19.927 --> 01:18:23.370]  That's all it is, is just gang mentality.
[01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:30.195]  Read your own gang handbook, cops, and look in the mirror and ask yourself what you've been turned into via peer pressure and tribal manipulation.
[01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:46.584]  In the video below, journalist Amy Miller describes how women arrested by Toronto police were threatened with rape, numerous women were strip-searched by male officers, and that one severely traumatized woman was sexually molested by police who stuck their fingers up her.
[01:18:46.584 --> 01:18:47.806]  And I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:52.572]  Sexual penetration of individuals against their will is called rape.
[01:18:52.572 --> 01:19:15.471]  If these reports are accurate and there is no reason to think otherwise, given everything else we've witnessed, not only over the past few days, but over the past several years in Canada, Toronto police officers are not only brutal thugs who like to lie about the law, unlawfully arrest people, snatch and grab protesters using unmarked cars, and beat up journalists for major newspapers, but they also are rapists who prey on innocent women.
[01:19:16.854 --> 01:19:29.980]  We have now learned that Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair engaged in a mass public deception by lying about the claim that Toronto's public acts mandated G20 protesters to show their ID or could be secretly arrested or couldn't videotape.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:31.320]  We've got all that on tape.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.102]  Just total lies.
[01:19:36.102 --> 01:19:39.344]  Just like I see more and more videos of cops walking up in England and the U.S.
[01:19:39.344 --> 01:19:41.125]  saying, you can't videotape.
[01:19:41.125 --> 01:19:42.625]  They're like, well, yes I can.
[01:19:42.625 --> 01:19:43.986]  They just beat them up and arrest them.
[01:19:45.353 --> 01:19:48.794]  You're here to pay my salary, blood bag, and that's it.
[01:19:48.794 --> 01:19:52.996]  Remember, America is the land of the blood bag.
[01:19:52.996 --> 01:19:54.337]  So is Canada, so is England.
[01:19:54.337 --> 01:19:59.419]  We are blood bags to government parasites, government mosquitoes, vampires.
[01:20:01.753 --> 01:20:04.977]  What if your local grocery store was suddenly closed?
[01:20:04.977 --> 01:20:05.598]  What if?
[01:20:05.598 --> 01:20:08.461]  What if a crisis of world events caused anarchy?
[01:20:08.461 --> 01:20:09.082]  What if?
[01:20:09.082 --> 01:20:13.246]  The time to prepare yourself and your family for what if is now.

[01:21:59.847 --> 01:22:02.828]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:02.828 --> 01:22:06.970]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:09.231]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:09.231 --> 01:22:14.393]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:22:14.393 --> 01:22:16.213]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:22:16.213 --> 01:22:17.754]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:22:17.754 --> 01:22:19.255]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:22:19.255 --> 01:22:22.616]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:22:22.616 --> 01:22:27.638]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:28.058 --> 01:22:28.258]  I think?
[01:22:42.935 --> 01:22:43.235]  Thank you.
[01:23:13.095 --> 01:23:17.058]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:21.200]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.041]  What did Crystal do?
[01:23:22.041 --> 01:23:26.003]  I ordered heart and body extract in August 2006.
[01:23:26.003 --> 01:23:29.265]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula.
[01:23:29.645 --> 01:23:32.387]  And could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:23:32.387 --> 01:23:36.228]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[01:24:15.967 --> 01:24:26.757]  Towards the end of the show, we'll get a report on Charlie Veitch being arrested.
[01:24:26.757 --> 01:24:30.079]  Charlie Veitch.
[01:24:30.079 --> 01:24:33.202]  Arrested once for a non-existent law.
[01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:34.503]  That's in the Toronto Star.
[01:24:34.503 --> 01:24:39.107]  They just said there's a new law that we can arrest you for any reason.
[01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:40.789]  And there's a new law you can't videotape.
[01:24:40.789 --> 01:24:42.871]  Turns out another hoax, a false arrest.
[01:24:43.895 --> 01:24:50.256]  And so he's one of the few videos out there where they are arresting people under the non-existent law.
[01:24:50.256 --> 01:24:57.438]  They arrested over 600 using it, but this is where it's on tape, the cops quoting the non-existent law.
[01:24:57.438 --> 01:25:02.599]  So they went back and said, oh, he's calling himself the Love Police.
[01:25:02.599 --> 01:25:07.740]  Well, that's impersonating an officer.
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:11.241]  Well, let me tell you, the cops in Toronto are the ones impersonating a peace officer.
[01:25:12.861 --> 01:25:16.104]  What you are is NKVD thugs.
[01:25:16.104 --> 01:25:23.911]  You need to go find a time machine and teleport yourself back to the 1950s so you can go lick Joe Stalin's boots.
[01:25:23.911 --> 01:25:26.254]  Again, why does everybody know the cops are bad in China?
[01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:27.575]  They're bad in Russia?
[01:25:27.575 --> 01:25:29.377]  They're bad in Mexico?
[01:25:29.377 --> 01:25:31.138]  Everybody, ooh, the cop's bad.
[01:25:31.138 --> 01:25:33.240]  But here, because we've been so brainwashed by TV,
[01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:37.700]  And let me tell you, America did have the best cops in the world.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:41.122]  I've done a lot of historical research and study, because they were locally controlled.
[01:25:41.122 --> 01:25:42.542]  They were very professional.
[01:25:42.542 --> 01:25:44.903]  They were constitutionalists, most of them.
[01:25:44.903 --> 01:25:50.126]  Chicago and New York were the first to get taken down by mafia-style cops in the last hundred years.
[01:25:50.126 --> 01:25:51.946]  And it's just gotten worse from there.
[01:25:51.946 --> 01:25:54.227]  Dallas is mafia-run.
[01:25:54.227 --> 01:25:58.429]  Miami's mafia-run.
[01:25:58.429 --> 01:25:58.649]  L.A.'
[01:25:58.609 --> 01:25:59.590]  's got the Vikings.
[01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:02.871]  They've got a secret mafia group, but I've met some of them.
[01:26:02.871 --> 01:26:03.892]  They claim they're patriots.
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:06.702]  I don't even know anymore.
[01:26:06.702 --> 01:26:07.844]  I just can't handle it.
[01:26:07.844 --> 01:26:08.365]  Why?
[01:26:08.365 --> 01:26:10.669]  Why do you have to work for these criminal banks?
[01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:17.540]  I mean, it's the criminal bankers who should all go to jail for what they've done with derivatives, who won't say where the trillions went, that come to your town...
[01:26:19.718 --> 01:26:21.278]  Do you think you're going to have any future cops?
[01:26:21.278 --> 01:26:22.379]  I mean, can you use your head?
[01:26:22.379 --> 01:26:24.919]  1.2 billion in security?
[01:26:24.919 --> 01:26:31.101]  Right at as much as the city budget of Toronto a year to protect a bunch of thugs who should have just met in one building?
[01:26:31.101 --> 01:26:38.783]  You know, they demand all this security so they can meet all over the city, so the whole city can be locked down because they're the real government.
[01:26:38.783 --> 01:26:40.603]  They're the private bankers coming to town.
[01:26:40.603 --> 01:26:42.684]  I'm going to cover that coming up in the next segment.
[01:26:42.684 --> 01:26:46.005]  Then the Russian spies, then the hurricane, then the Iran situation.
[01:26:47.708 --> 01:26:49.856]  And we'll talk to Dan Dick of...
[01:26:52.861 --> 01:26:56.424]  We're Dan Dix of Press for Truth coming up.
[01:26:56.424 --> 01:27:00.367]  The hearing is in the next hour, supposedly, but who knows if that'll happen.
[01:27:00.367 --> 01:27:05.090]  We'll get him on regardless before the show ends, working with Charlie Veitch over there.
[01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:08.913]  But will G20 police succeed in covering up reports of rape and torture?
[01:27:08.913 --> 01:27:11.055]  Important article, presentplanet.com.
[01:27:11.055 --> 01:27:15.838]  We gotta force this into the mainstream news and the video reports and journals talking about it right there.
[01:27:15.838 --> 01:27:17.380]  Here's another one, The Star.
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:20.622]  No extra powers granted to police during G20 summit?
[01:27:20.622 --> 01:27:21.483]  It was all a lie.
[01:27:21.963 --> 01:27:22.764]  The Globe and Mail.
[01:27:22.764 --> 01:27:27.909]  Police admit no 5 meter rule existed on security fence law.
[01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:28.990]  And I've got other articles.
[01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:32.454]  G20 security fence 5 meter rule never existed.
[01:27:32.454 --> 01:27:40.181]  They arrested Charlie for not showing ID and for quote videotaping near the fence.
[01:27:40.181 --> 01:27:41.142]  Here's the disinfo.
[01:27:43.649 --> 01:27:47.090]  Headline, a news 1130, it's also in several newspapers.
[01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:50.872]  UK man arrested for impersonating officer prior to G20 summit.
[01:27:50.872 --> 01:27:53.613]  But you gotta love all the comments on these newspapers and radio stations.
[01:27:53.613 --> 01:27:56.654]  It's like, the police are impersonating Canadian citizens.
[01:27:56.654 --> 01:27:58.675]  They're impersonating peace officers.
[01:27:58.675 --> 01:28:01.576]  You know, Canada's now fallen into darkness.
[01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:02.356]  We now know.
[01:28:02.356 --> 01:28:07.098]  See, Canadians are really nice, cool, smart, educated, sweet people.
[01:28:07.098 --> 01:28:09.939]  The cliche of Canadians being nice is true.
[01:28:09.939 --> 01:28:12.860]  In my experience, the stereotype is accurate.
[01:28:14.534 --> 01:28:15.775]  But they are oblivious.
[01:28:15.775 --> 01:28:21.762]  The greatest evils grow in the shadow of goodness.
[01:28:21.762 --> 01:28:25.285]  Because they're gullible, just like the American people.
[01:28:25.285 --> 01:28:26.326]  You're gullible!
[01:28:26.326 --> 01:28:28.308]  Stop being gullible!
[01:28:28.308 --> 01:28:30.250]  All I want is to have good police officers.
[01:28:30.250 --> 01:28:32.573]  All I want is to have good mayors and good congresspeople.
[01:28:34.301 --> 01:28:36.582]  And the cops are a lot better than the people above them.
[01:28:36.582 --> 01:28:38.442]  But they're trying to warp you.
[01:28:38.442 --> 01:28:40.863]  They're trying to make it macho and cool.
[01:28:40.863 --> 01:28:42.564]  You know, kill a commie for mommy.
[01:28:42.564 --> 01:28:44.304]  But you don't kill commies for mommy.
[01:28:44.304 --> 01:28:46.645]  You're not fighting VC that are shooting back.
[01:28:46.645 --> 01:28:50.066]  You're beating up little women.
[01:28:50.066 --> 01:28:58.088]  And they put you in these Darth Vader outfits when they know psychologically, not only does a Darth Vader outfit scare people, as they admit that's the intent, but the wearer.
[01:28:58.088 --> 01:29:03.050]  I mean, I've joked around at Halloween and dressed up, you know, like a monster.
[01:29:04.059 --> 01:29:07.220]  And, you know, catch myself running around, kinda acting wild.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:13.661]  Or, you know, dress up like Darth Vader for a skit I did for TV and catch myself, you know, acting all crazy.
[01:29:13.661 --> 01:29:19.763]  They have a Warner Brothers Looney Tunes cartoon where they put different hats on Elmer Fudd and they show how he behaves in a different way.
[01:29:19.763 --> 01:29:23.263]  Well, that's actually been shown.
[01:29:23.263 --> 01:29:26.044]  Firefighters are true public servants, true heroes.
[01:29:26.044 --> 01:29:30.525]  Now the feds are trying to federalize them and turn them into spies and warp and ruin those great men and women.
[01:29:31.732 --> 01:29:33.933]  They're trying to turn our military against us.
[01:29:33.933 --> 01:29:38.296]  But then when you get the internal reports, the police are being trained to go after the military.
[01:29:38.296 --> 01:29:40.297]  Because they don't trust you, police and military.
[01:29:40.297 --> 01:29:41.638]  They hate your guts.
[01:29:41.638 --> 01:29:44.920]  They know you might wake up and actually become patriots.
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.842]  Alright, we'll get into some other key news straight ahead.
[01:29:47.842 --> 01:29:51.024]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.024 --> 01:29:52.425]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.425 --> 01:29:54.947]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.947 --> 01:29:57.648]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.199 --> 01:30:06.162]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.162 --> 01:30:15.029]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.029 --> 01:30:19.652]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:19.652 --> 01:30:30.481]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.101 --> 01:30:40.604]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:30:53.529 --> 01:30:56.290]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:31:00.046 --> 01:31:04.590]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:05.511]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.511 --> 01:31:08.934]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:08.934 --> 01:31:09.794]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.794 --> 01:31:14.678]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.678 --> 01:31:15.439]  It's true.
[01:31:15.439 --> 01:31:20.303]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.303 --> 01:31:21.144]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.144 --> 01:31:24.727]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.727 --> 01:31:28.390]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:29.411]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.411 --> 01:31:32.173]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.173 --> 01:31:35.855]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.855 --> 01:31:36.636]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.636 --> 01:31:40.799]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.799 --> 01:31:45.542]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:45.842 --> 01:31:50.008]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.008 --> 01:31:51.811]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.811 --> 01:31:54.054]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:54.054 --> 01:31:56.397]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:01.823 --> 01:32:03.984]  Subject to public police action.
[01:32:03.984 --> 01:32:05.245]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.245 --> 01:32:08.828]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:08.828 --> 01:32:11.429]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.429 --> 01:32:16.813]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.273 --> 01:32:23.958]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:23.958 --> 01:32:29.942]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:29.942 --> 01:32:33.625]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.085 --> 01:32:38.386]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:44.328]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.328 --> 01:32:47.890]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:47.890 --> 01:32:49.870]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:50.991]  It's here.
[01:32:50.991 --> 01:32:57.793]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:15.705 --> 01:33:42.447]  Ladies and gentlemen, Reuters is reporting that Obama is now beginning the process to allow international help to come in, but he has his lawyers in the EPA now going into a process that may take weeks or months.
[01:33:43.442 --> 01:33:53.968]  Kind of like they claimed a month ago that the media was allowed to be on the beach, but then the order still stood in effect that the media could not be on the beach.
[01:33:53.968 --> 01:33:55.709]  There's no law that the feds can do that.
[01:33:55.709 --> 01:33:56.870]  They have no jurisdiction.
[01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:59.071]  They just have people that'll arrest you.
[01:33:59.071 --> 01:34:03.554]  And so people get intimidated and acquiesce to the tyrannical precedent.
[01:34:05.524 --> 01:34:07.385]  And here's just more proof of that.
[01:34:07.385 --> 01:34:08.646]  I'm gonna cover it more later.
[01:34:08.646 --> 01:34:12.328]  Oil spill visits get partisan.
[01:34:12.328 --> 01:34:17.512]  Oil spill visits get partisan, Politico.
[01:34:17.512 --> 01:34:26.618]  And it turns out that 10 lawmakers wish to have a congressional trip to the Gulf and be able to be given a tour.
[01:34:26.618 --> 01:34:30.680]  And House Democrats said, you are not allowed in the area.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:34.583]  So now elected representatives of this country,
[01:34:35.748 --> 01:34:37.729]  Are not allowed to go down there and look.
[01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:42.031]  Oh yeah, Obama's not blocking the media, even though it keeps happening every day.
[01:34:42.031 --> 01:34:44.272]  We're now 70 plus days into this.
[01:34:44.272 --> 01:34:51.175]  There's one Taiwanese ship they've been offering for over a month that can skim 500,000 barrels.
[01:34:51.175 --> 01:34:54.377]  That's the Associated Press.
[01:34:54.377 --> 01:34:58.339]  500,000 barrels a day.
[01:34:58.339 --> 01:34:59.939]  More than all the U.S.
[01:34:59.939 --> 01:35:00.920]  relief ships combined.
[01:35:02.005 --> 01:35:05.810]  But it's not allowed, and they've got more than 30.
[01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:11.577]  Some estimates are more than 50 in this hemisphere of Dutch and German and Norwegian and Japanese ships.
[01:35:11.577 --> 01:35:14.100]  They can do the same thing, and they are not allowed.
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:15.221]  They could clean that up.
[01:35:16.158 --> 01:35:18.119]  But not soon.
[01:35:18.119 --> 01:35:20.540]  Now the swells are six to ten feet.
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:27.623]  Now that hurricane, and there's going to be ones that are worse, because if one comes right up towards Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida, it'll drive it all in.
[01:35:27.623 --> 01:35:32.826]  This is just a glancing blow, but it is sending big swells in that are driving that oil towards the beach.
[01:35:32.826 --> 01:35:35.067]  And now in the next few days, hell is going to hit.
[01:35:36.712 --> 01:35:40.154]  Oh, and Obama won't let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:35:40.154 --> 01:35:44.375]  Good thing he dumped all his Vanguard stock in BP the week before.
[01:35:44.375 --> 01:35:46.556]  Good thing the BP CEO did too.
[01:35:46.556 --> 01:35:47.757]  Good thing Goldman Sachs dumped 44%.
[01:35:47.757 --> 01:35:48.157]  Oh, good thing BP...
[01:35:51.798 --> 01:36:06.983]  Control by Goldman Sachs that runs the entire White House and Kagan gave the order for unconventional drilling and the oil rig operators, the engineers said it will blow up two months before and threw fits for two months but followed orders and it blew up.
[01:36:07.563 --> 01:36:18.148]  They blew that thing up on purpose, and they've blocked all the relief efforts, and they've blocked the ships coming in, and now the stinking hurricanes are coming, and they're saying, President, hold them as long as you can.
[01:36:18.148 --> 01:36:19.649]  It's already spread across the Gulf.
[01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:22.870]  Even the biggest ships are going to have trouble getting to all the oil.
[01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:30.894]  Just block them a few more weeks, and another big hurricane's coming in, and we'll get the civil emergency in the Gulf.
[01:36:30.894 --> 01:36:34.276]  Remember what Congressman Senator Kyle said two weeks ago.
[01:36:35.595 --> 01:36:38.897]  He went into Obama in a private meeting.
[01:36:38.897 --> 01:36:40.719]  We played the clip here.
[01:36:40.719 --> 01:36:42.260]  He told a town hall.
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:46.243]  And he went to Obama and he said, listen, there's mass murder and thousands dead on the border.
[01:36:46.243 --> 01:36:47.203]  It's totally collapsed.
[01:36:47.203 --> 01:36:50.486]  80 to 100 miles in, they've totally taken over.
[01:36:50.486 --> 01:36:51.747]  The police are begging for help.
[01:36:51.747 --> 01:36:54.268]  It's a total collapse.
[01:36:54.268 --> 01:36:55.069]  We need the military.
[01:36:55.069 --> 01:37:00.273]  And he said, well, I'm going to use that crisis down there to get the reform passed, which is legalization.
[01:37:00.273 --> 01:37:02.494]  And he said, Mr. President, that's terrorism.
[01:37:02.494 --> 01:37:03.395]  That's holding us hostage.
[01:37:04.892 --> 01:37:07.215]  The president said, well, that's what I'm doing.
[01:37:07.215 --> 01:37:15.666]  Of course they're accentuating the border crisis by cracking down on cartels they don't control to start a drug war.
[01:37:15.666 --> 01:37:19.211]  Of course they're blocking the oil relief.
[01:37:19.211 --> 01:37:20.392]  Of course they are.
[01:37:20.392 --> 01:37:21.734]  They blew the oil well.
[01:37:22.935 --> 01:37:36.180]  Either they did it by orders they knew would cause it, or, what a lot of eyewitnesses and reports are proving, an unauthorized, secret change was made, and we know the feds were on board when it happened, an unscheduled visit, and it blew up.
[01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:38.941]  You can just see them planting the plastic on that sucker.
[01:37:38.941 --> 01:37:42.042]  And look at all their responses since then.
[01:37:42.042 --> 01:37:43.623]  Look at everything they've done.
[01:37:43.623 --> 01:37:47.124]  They need this diversion while they get the Iran war ready.
[01:37:47.124 --> 01:37:50.025]  They need this diversion.
[01:37:50.025 --> 01:37:51.646]  They need this diversion right now.
[01:37:55.421 --> 01:37:58.383]  They need it while they get their carbon tax through.
[01:37:58.383 --> 01:38:01.984]  I told you he'd call for a carbon tax to, quote, fix this, and they have.
[01:38:01.984 --> 01:38:03.205]  Now, I'm gonna go to your calls right now.
[01:38:03.205 --> 01:38:16.612]  We're getting a quick report coming up in a little while from Dan Dix, who's friends with Veatch and has been part of the video reports we've had in the last five days here on Friday and on Sunday and on Monday and Tuesday, and now it's Wednesday.
[01:38:16.612 --> 01:38:18.533]  We're getting another report from him.
[01:38:18.533 --> 01:38:23.475]  But coming up also, dollars should be replaced as international standard for UN report.
[01:38:24.716 --> 01:38:27.619]  But I want to say this finally, and I'm going to cover it more in the next hour.
[01:38:27.619 --> 01:38:34.646]  Why, if this oil rig is 40 plus miles off the coast, international waters start 12 miles out.
[01:38:36.838 --> 01:38:41.422]  Why are international companies not coming into the Gulf because the U.S.
[01:38:41.422 --> 01:38:43.143]  tells them not to?
[01:38:43.143 --> 01:38:50.429]  BP is a sovereign corporate government, just like the Vatican, just like Israel, just like some lowly U.N.
[01:38:50.429 --> 01:38:56.875]  clerk has diplomatic immunity to rape and kill and rob banks and slap cops upside the head.
[01:38:56.875 --> 01:38:59.437]  You notice when a cop does something to some arrogant U.N.
[01:38:59.437 --> 01:39:04.641]  diplomat and stands up for themselves, the cop gets fired immediately, like in Houston.
[01:39:08.148 --> 01:39:13.712]  When the guy reportedly just basically spit in the cop's face and shoved him, so the cop slammed him down and arrested him.
[01:39:13.712 --> 01:39:16.535]  Oh, the cop's in big trouble.
[01:39:16.535 --> 01:39:24.521]  You know, UN officials are caught with sex slaves in their houses and shipping drugs in, and they don't get in trouble, because they're diplomatic immunity.
[01:39:24.521 --> 01:39:26.503]  And BP, that's what the New World Order is.
[01:39:26.503 --> 01:39:28.704]  They're a bunch of offshore corporate pirates.
[01:39:28.704 --> 01:39:31.286]  They declare themselves sovereign immunity.
[01:39:31.286 --> 01:39:33.708]  They're out 40-something miles in the Gulf.
[01:39:33.708 --> 01:39:35.310]  They cause a giant oil spill.
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:47.207]  And Obama comes in and says states and counties and cities can't clean stuff up even on their own shore or inland in their rivers and waterways and estuaries and wetlands.
[01:39:47.207 --> 01:39:51.249]  Ten miles in, the feds have declared jurisdiction over those states.
[01:39:51.249 --> 01:39:54.091]  Total out-of-control behavior.
[01:39:54.091 --> 01:40:02.096]  You got all these international groups want to come in and help and they're waiting, sucking their thumbs because Obama won't let them.
[01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:04.117]  And now ten members of Congress
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:10.421]  Wanted to be able to have a tour.
[01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:14.383]  This is confirmed!
[01:40:14.383 --> 01:40:16.624]  And the Democrats say, you're not allowed to look.
[01:40:16.624 --> 01:40:25.707]  And I guarantee you, if a congressman, if a senator, showed up and wanted to show the oil spill, they just have some goons arrest them!
[01:40:25.707 --> 01:40:31.089]  Because in America, it's all about working for the bankers and the stinking oil companies that are owned by the banks.
[01:40:31.089 --> 01:40:32.650]  And if you do, you can do whatever you want.
[01:40:34.301 --> 01:40:45.530]  And BP picked an area right off our coast, and they pulled this because they've invested tens of billions in the carbon tax garbage, and they're not accustomed to losing, and they need their global tax.
[01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:51.714]  What do you think's gonna back up these new private SDRs they're announcing that end the dollar?
[01:40:51.714 --> 01:40:53.195]  It's environment taxes.
[01:40:53.195 --> 01:40:54.436]  That's the public plan.
[01:40:54.436 --> 01:40:56.258]  They've got to have it!
[01:40:56.258 --> 01:40:58.219]  Their entire agenda!
[01:40:58.219 --> 01:41:02.743]  And just like in chess, to win at chess, you've gotta know your opponent,
[01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:06.045]  You've got to have patience.
[01:41:06.045 --> 01:41:07.126]  You've got to know your opponent.
[01:41:07.126 --> 01:41:07.666]  Three things.
[01:41:07.666 --> 01:41:13.189]  You've got to have patience, know your opponent, and be willing to make sacrifices.
[01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:16.230]  And I'm not a very good chess player.
[01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:21.953]  But in the last few years, I've gotten back into playing, and I play my son.
[01:41:21.953 --> 01:41:22.514]  And you know what?
[01:41:22.514 --> 01:41:24.975]  He's about to be eight years old.
[01:41:24.975 --> 01:41:25.835]  And he's really smart.
[01:41:25.835 --> 01:41:26.816]  A lot smarter than I am.
[01:41:26.816 --> 01:41:28.377]  It's incredible.
[01:41:28.377 --> 01:41:31.799]  He has a truly photographic memory.
[01:41:31.799 --> 01:41:31.999]  But...
[01:41:34.025 --> 01:41:39.188]  The only way I can beat him now, because we've been playing chess about six years, about four years actually.
[01:41:39.188 --> 01:41:44.331]  Well, he's been playing since about four, you know, four years.
[01:41:44.331 --> 01:41:48.633]  The only way I can beat him is sacrifice.
[01:41:48.633 --> 01:41:49.914]  He doesn't understand that yet.
[01:41:49.914 --> 01:41:51.154]  He just can't get it.
[01:41:51.154 --> 01:41:52.095]  And I beat him every time.
[01:41:52.095 --> 01:41:59.059]  If I play him a straight up game, he can look at all the moves and all the pieces and the game goes on for like 20 minutes and I'm kind of halfway paying attention.
[01:41:59.059 --> 01:42:00.600]  If I actually focus, I can always beat him.
[01:42:02.847 --> 01:42:05.190]  Again, I'm not that good of a chess player, but he is good for his age.
[01:42:05.190 --> 01:42:08.454]  We put him in a few chess camps, too, so he's learned some tricks.
[01:42:08.454 --> 01:42:13.321]  But, um... He doesn't understand sacrifice.
[01:42:13.321 --> 01:42:14.102]  The globalists do.
[01:42:14.102 --> 01:42:18.808]  Folks, the globalists... Japan had already unconditionally surrendered.
[01:42:18.808 --> 01:42:21.191]  And they dropped A-bombs on them just to impress everybody.
[01:42:22.935 --> 01:42:26.318]  You think your life means anything to the New World Order?
[01:42:26.318 --> 01:42:29.820]  And to you cops out there, I don't want to be your enemy.
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:34.144]  I mean, I did have cops tell me how I was going to be raped when I was a kid.
[01:42:34.144 --> 01:42:38.107]  I did have a jail guard try to rape me when I was in juvenile one time.
[01:42:38.763 --> 01:42:44.965]  You know, I have seen all the reports of cops waiting outside topless bars and raping women in every major city.
[01:42:44.965 --> 01:42:46.405]  They get caught constantly.
[01:42:46.405 --> 01:42:54.908]  You get a bunch of lunatics who want power, and you guys have got to kick those people out, not promote them and praise them and defend them.
[01:42:54.908 --> 01:43:08.352]  Let's take a few calls, because I... We're going to take calls from Laura, Tim, John, Joe, Jason,
[01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:14.493]  And others.
[01:43:14.493 --> 01:43:17.717]  John in London, Laura in Iowa, and others.
[01:43:17.717 --> 01:43:20.861]  I'll take a gamut of calls or two.
[01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:25.827]  A gamut, not a gambit.
[01:43:27.674 --> 01:43:30.136]  I'll take some of those and then I'm going to get into the oil spill.
[01:43:30.136 --> 01:43:31.017]  I'm going to get into Iran.
[01:43:31.017 --> 01:43:32.418]  I'm going to get into the Russian spy stuff.
[01:43:32.418 --> 01:43:34.039]  I didn't cover that the first two days.
[01:43:34.039 --> 01:43:36.541]  I wanted to analyze it and look at it.
[01:43:36.541 --> 01:43:39.743]  My research says, yeah, they're spies.
[01:43:39.743 --> 01:43:42.185]  I mean, I ought to get Tarpley on here.
[01:43:42.185 --> 01:43:42.786]  God love him.
[01:43:42.786 --> 01:43:45.468]  He's a great guy and his info checks out almost all the time.
[01:43:45.468 --> 01:43:51.232]  But I saw him on TV saying that these people look more like reporters than spies.
[01:43:51.232 --> 01:43:51.653]  Tarpley.
[01:43:53.254 --> 01:43:54.175]  God love him.
[01:43:54.175 --> 01:44:00.119]  I mean, you got husband and wife teams with fake names that are illegal aliens operating under fake names.
[01:44:00.119 --> 01:44:02.722]  They're spies, okay?
[01:44:02.722 --> 01:44:07.065]  And I guess his point is that, yeah, they're just here getting intelligence and that's normal.
[01:44:07.065 --> 01:44:07.986]  And you know what?
[01:44:07.986 --> 01:44:09.407]  That is standard operating procedure.
[01:44:11.673 --> 01:44:23.959]  But just because our government's overrun with traitors and overrun with banks and corporations that are the real national security threat and that globalism itself is high treason and is about global corporations overthrowing your nation.
[01:44:23.959 --> 01:44:25.980]  I mean, globalization is treason.
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:28.721]  In fact, that's an Alex Jones quote.
[01:44:28.721 --> 01:44:32.323]  Globalization is treason against national sovereignty.
[01:44:32.323 --> 01:44:33.984]  It is a corporate criminal takeover.
[01:44:35.566 --> 01:44:46.611]  And so just because the nation's run by criminals and is a whorehouse, where if you're a British or Israeli spy, you can run entire departments, and Israel has more control over our Pentagon than our own government does.
[01:44:46.611 --> 01:44:48.112]  Israel brags about that.
[01:44:48.112 --> 01:44:49.252]  I mean, that's espionage.
[01:44:49.252 --> 01:44:50.093]  That's wrong.
[01:44:50.093 --> 01:44:53.034]  As an American, I speak out against it and get criticized for it.
[01:44:55.157 --> 01:44:58.198]  And Russia is as crooked as a barrel of snakes.
[01:44:58.198 --> 01:45:06.300]  But the issue is, all this hysteria and hyperventilating over these spies is a joke.
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:09.600]  The new Cold War is back, and that's why they decided to bust them.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:12.221]  You know, they knew they were here seven years ago.
[01:45:12.221 --> 01:45:13.441]  Probably longer.
[01:45:13.441 --> 01:45:14.441]  They knew day one.
[01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:20.763]  How infiltrated do you think the Russian government is by the corporate CIA people that run our government?
[01:45:21.601 --> 01:45:29.831]  They infiltrate all the drug cartels, they infiltrate the drug companies, they infiltrate the media, they infiltrate everything!
[01:45:29.831 --> 01:45:30.932]  This is the big empire!
[01:45:30.932 --> 01:45:31.954]  They're the best!
[01:45:31.954 --> 01:45:32.735]  They're the most evil!
[01:45:36.843 --> 01:45:43.827]  It's just, they are now demonizing Russia because they're gearing up for World War III, ladies and gentlemen, teamed up with China.
[01:45:43.827 --> 01:45:45.788]  The United States has teamed up with China.
[01:45:45.788 --> 01:45:49.210]  Let me tell you something, China is a lot more evil than Russia.
[01:45:49.210 --> 01:46:01.778]  And China openly, with Henry Kissinger and all these other government officials, for decades, has a direct line into all US intelligence, technology, business deals, everything.
[01:46:01.778 --> 01:46:04.720]  Our government is in a merger with China.
[01:46:06.414 --> 01:46:20.038]  And so you got a pack of criminals that are selling out our nation to the global corporate banking cartel, who can then point their fingers at the Russians and say, and I heard Laura Ingraham this morning, I was driving to work and it was the craziest thing.
[01:46:20.038 --> 01:46:25.339]  Laura Ingraham was saying, the Russians have infiltrated us because Obama is weak.
[01:46:25.339 --> 01:46:28.260]  And look at him with Medvedev eating hamburgers last week.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.140]  This is word for word.
[01:46:30.424 --> 01:46:35.968]  And she had some writer on named Thor going, yes, Obama allowed the Ruskies to infiltrate.
[01:46:35.968 --> 01:46:39.011]  Obama is a CIA agent on record.
[01:46:39.011 --> 01:46:42.814]  Obama is a complete black op operator.
[01:46:42.814 --> 01:46:50.760]  Obama is a 100% New World Order shill.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:53.522]  This is ridiculous.
[01:46:53.522 --> 01:46:53.642]  And
[01:46:54.739 --> 01:47:01.165]  If these Russian spies were here seven years ago, that puts it square at the feet of George W. Bush.
[01:47:01.165 --> 01:47:04.048]  And I'm not defending Obama, they all work for the same people.
[01:47:04.048 --> 01:47:05.729]  It's a complete joke!
[01:47:05.729 --> 01:47:10.714]  Our stinking government on record, Fletcher, Prouty, all of them documented, it's now declassified.
[01:47:10.714 --> 01:47:13.856]  Put, put Lenin in power!
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:18.742]  They funded Ho Chi Minh!
[01:47:18.742 --> 01:47:20.643]  They stage all this stuff!
[01:47:20.643 --> 01:47:22.404]  They put Mao into power.
[01:47:22.404 --> 01:47:23.985]  On record now, it's declassified.
[01:47:23.985 --> 01:47:26.127]  They put Saddam into power.
[01:47:26.127 --> 01:47:27.248]  They created Al-Qaeda.
[01:47:29.397 --> 01:47:31.579]  That's why these people can't be beat.
[01:47:31.579 --> 01:47:39.704]  Because the public will not wake up and think at a high level, three-dimensional level, it's like three-dimensional chess, and realize the game we're fighting here.
[01:47:39.704 --> 01:47:44.047]  These people create a web, a full spectrum of false information.
[01:47:44.047 --> 01:47:45.809]  They are not Americans.
[01:47:45.809 --> 01:47:48.871]  The bankers that run America hate this country.
[01:47:48.871 --> 01:47:49.792]  They are the ultimate
[01:47:50.572 --> 01:47:51.172]  Traitors!
[01:47:51.172 --> 01:47:54.813]  So I say arrest Russian spies and execute them.
[01:47:54.813 --> 01:47:58.574]  And I say arrest all the banker corporate spies and execute them.
[01:47:58.574 --> 01:48:05.676]  I say take every anti-American piece of trash and put them before a jury and then give them the death sentence.
[01:48:05.676 --> 01:48:11.318]  But I don't want to sit here and hear about how the Ruskies are going to get us all day and kill us.
[01:48:15.006 --> 01:48:24.029]  I don't want to hear about it so the criminal traitors that run our government can sit there and point their finger at Russia, and then so they can look like patriots.
[01:48:24.029 --> 01:48:28.510]  The real traitors are the ones running our country, and I want them out of here!
[01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:31.891]  I want the Goldman Sachs people arrested!
[01:48:31.891 --> 01:48:34.452]  You're going to arrest these two-bit Russian spies?
[01:48:34.452 --> 01:48:35.212]  Good.
[01:48:35.212 --> 01:48:37.813]  Now, you arrest the Goldman Sachs hijackers.
[01:48:38.897 --> 01:48:51.727]  Alright, let's for this segment and the rest of the next segment give you a report on Charlie Veitch with Dan Dix of Press for Truth who's been kind enough to join us during the G20, G8 and to break down what's happened.
[01:48:51.727 --> 01:48:54.369]  He's about to go into the court hearing.
[01:48:54.369 --> 01:48:59.754]  Go over what's happened to Mr. Veitch because he is now a political prisoner, Dan.
[01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:01.109]  He is.
[01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:04.192]  I'm just outside the courthouse now.
[01:49:04.192 --> 01:49:12.639]  We're going to go in and I'll sign for his security and try to post his bail so that we can get him out of there.
[01:49:12.639 --> 01:49:23.909]  This of course is all because the police saw the video that we posted where Charlie was talking to his security guard and he was very very obviously joking.
[01:49:23.909 --> 01:49:27.632]  The whole video he is doing what Charlie does best which is
[01:49:29.974 --> 01:49:35.921]  You know, he raises love and lowers fear and brings an element of humor to his activism.
[01:49:35.921 --> 01:49:41.908]  So he was telling the guard, you know, I'm British intelligence, I'm Metro Police.
[01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:47.174]  And as soon as they saw the video, they put out a warrant for his arrest and stopped him at the airport.
[01:49:47.794 --> 01:50:08.452]  Now I do have information, it's not confirmed until I get out of the courthouse, but I believe his options are going to be to either plead guilty and be deported back to the UK, or if he wants to plead innocent, he's most likely not going to be able to leave the country and will have to stay here until his court hearing.
[01:50:09.992 --> 01:50:16.285]  And Canada is a nation that will arrest people for their speech and ship them to foreign nations, so they're a very evil government.
[01:50:16.285 --> 01:50:17.327]  He's in a lot of trouble.
[01:50:18.129 --> 01:50:30.476]  And the really crazy thing is, this whole thing stems from the original arrest, and that's why we posted the video, and the Toronto Chief of Police here in Toronto, Bill Blair, has just announced that there was no law.
[01:50:30.476 --> 01:50:35.739]  Well here's the deal, he cannot plead guilty, because they'll even change the deal on him that way.
[01:50:35.739 --> 01:50:39.922]  He's gotta go ahead and ride it out, this'll become a big international situation.
[01:50:40.702 --> 01:50:41.103]  Stay there.
[01:50:41.103 --> 01:50:43.986]  I want to talk to you more about his case and how we help him in the final segment.
[01:50:43.986 --> 01:50:50.054]  I know you've got to get into the building and then join us after you try to bail him out and after you've seen the trial towards the end of the show.
[01:50:50.054 --> 01:50:51.675]  We have to go into overdrive.
[01:50:51.675 --> 01:50:56.842]  And then also I want to get into the women saying they saw police raping them with objects.
[01:50:56.842 --> 01:50:59.304]  So the police are now reportedly raping women.
[01:50:59.304 --> 01:51:00.145]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.192 --> 01:51:02.493]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.493 --> 01:51:08.079]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.079 --> 01:51:13.104]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.104 --> 01:51:13.585]  It's true.
[01:51:13.585 --> 01:51:18.130]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.670 --> 01:51:23.894]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.894 --> 01:51:26.195]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:26.195 --> 01:51:30.998]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[01:51:32.119 --> 01:51:35.181]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.181 --> 01:51:38.824]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:51:53.013 --> 01:51:57.856]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.856 --> 01:52:00.238]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:14.922]  I wish your butt was still silver.
[01:54:31.694 --> 01:54:33.616]  I'm local police.
[01:54:33.616 --> 01:54:38.599]  I've been hired to stage events to blame it on the protesters like you guys did a few years ago.
[01:54:38.599 --> 01:54:40.840]  I'm the love police here to bring love.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:45.824]  This would be like somebody in a Ronald McDonald outfit and they claim he was impersonating the president.
[01:54:45.824 --> 01:54:46.965]  But it just shows.
[01:54:46.965 --> 01:54:54.650]  Meanwhile, foreign bankers, a lot of them with arrest warrants, can fly into town like George Soros and the police just lick their boots.
[01:54:54.650 --> 01:54:57.091]  Finishing up and then popping in after the
[01:54:58.992 --> 01:55:14.035]  Yeah, Alex, they literally needed an excuse because of his political message in order to try to stifle his efforts.
[01:55:14.035 --> 01:55:15.076]  I just got out of the cab.
[01:55:15.076 --> 01:55:16.936]  I'm right in front of the courthouse now.
[01:55:16.936 --> 01:55:20.877]  His hearing is in about two minutes, so unfortunately I'm going to have to get in there.
[01:55:20.877 --> 01:55:23.517]  Oh, I just heard he is out now.
[01:55:23.517 --> 01:55:25.618]  He's coming out right now.
[01:55:25.618 --> 01:55:26.138]  Amazing.
[01:55:26.918 --> 01:55:27.878]  So maybe we'll stick around.
[01:55:27.878 --> 01:55:28.939]  There's a lot of reporters here.
[01:55:28.939 --> 01:55:29.839]  He's coming out right now.
[01:55:29.839 --> 01:55:33.381]  Well, please let us talk to him first before he talks to the reporters.
[01:55:33.381 --> 01:55:34.261]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:55:34.261 --> 01:55:36.042]  Can we talk to him first, please?
[01:55:36.042 --> 01:55:36.762]  Yeah.
[01:55:36.762 --> 01:55:38.903]  He needs to point out he's a political prisoner.
[01:55:38.903 --> 01:55:40.604]  This is all trumped up.
[01:55:42.153 --> 01:55:44.075]  Yeah, I'm looking for him now.
[01:55:44.075 --> 01:55:45.416]  He's supposed to be coming out now.
[01:55:45.416 --> 01:55:48.139]  There's a whole slew of media here.
[01:55:48.139 --> 01:55:49.280]  It's made national attention.
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:50.541]  I mean, it's been all over the news.
[01:55:50.541 --> 01:55:52.303]  This morning I saw it.
[01:55:52.303 --> 01:55:56.927]  You know, the video that we originally posted was posted on CBC's The National.
[01:55:56.927 --> 01:55:58.769]  So it's already all over the news.
[01:55:58.769 --> 01:56:01.532]  And they're all here to speak to him when he gets out.
[01:56:01.732 --> 01:56:06.937]  And the media realizes he was arrested for a crime that did not exist.
[01:56:06.937 --> 01:56:08.498]  The police lied about that.
[01:56:08.498 --> 01:56:11.301]  And so now they're trying to trump up new charges.
[01:56:11.301 --> 01:56:13.823]  So just let me get a brief statement from him.
[01:56:13.823 --> 01:56:18.147]  Then he can talk to the media and then we'll call you back after he's done talking to the media.
[01:56:18.147 --> 01:56:21.691]  Or perhaps you can hold the phone up during the impromptu press conference.
[01:56:21.691 --> 01:56:25.895]  That's probably what you want to do is bring him outside and just have him have a press conference.
[01:56:26.638 --> 01:56:29.139]  Yeah, well, that's what it looks like they're preparing to do.
[01:56:29.139 --> 01:56:33.081]  There's a bunch of them here, cameras, a whole bunch of people.
[01:56:33.081 --> 01:56:35.923]  So, we're all standing by the door at the side of the courthouse.
[01:56:35.923 --> 01:56:42.927]  You know, that's why the Canadians had to let me out after 15 hours when they were going to charge me with all these crimes, was because we got word out to the media.
[01:56:42.927 --> 01:56:45.308]  They want to do this in the cover of dark.
[01:56:45.308 --> 01:56:45.788]  Absolutely.
[01:56:45.788 --> 01:56:49.870]  Not to mention, they didn't even let Luke Rudowsky into the country.
[01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:51.971]  You know, I wonder if he pled guilty.
[01:56:51.971 --> 01:56:53.672]  I sure hope he didn't.
[01:56:53.672 --> 01:56:54.493]  Have you found him yet?
[01:56:55.948 --> 01:56:56.789]  Uh, Charles?
[01:56:56.789 --> 01:56:57.730]  Uh, no.
[01:56:57.730 --> 01:56:59.531]  No, he's still in there.
[01:56:59.531 --> 01:57:04.136]  Somebody may have given you disinfo telling you he's going to be let out.
[01:57:04.136 --> 01:57:09.702]  Well, there's a whole slew of media here waiting for him to get out.
[01:57:09.702 --> 01:57:11.745]  So maybe they've decided to drop the charges.
[01:57:12.529 --> 01:57:13.489]  It's tough to say, really.
[01:57:13.489 --> 01:57:17.291]  It's tough to say until we get... Well, while we're waiting, let me ask you this.
[01:57:17.291 --> 01:57:27.275]  We see all these different press reports now of them threatening to rape women and actually sexually abusing them, actually penetrating them with objects, including fingers.
[01:57:27.275 --> 01:57:29.716]  I mean, this is incredible that this really happened.
[01:57:29.716 --> 01:57:33.298]  And this looks very credible.
[01:57:33.298 --> 01:57:34.878]  Dan, Dan, what's your view on that?
[01:57:34.878 --> 01:57:36.359]  I'm sorry, Alex?
[01:57:36.359 --> 01:57:40.821]  What's your view on the reports of threats of rape and women being penetrated?
[01:57:41.351 --> 01:57:46.313]  Yeah, I briefly saw a video of that on YouTube last night.
[01:57:46.313 --> 01:57:56.216]  More and more information is coming out, and I'm sure we're going to get a lot more information in the coming weeks about what actually took place in Toronto during the G20 Summit weekend.
[01:57:56.216 --> 01:58:01.298]  But as we all know, it was an absolutely unprecedented show of force.
[01:58:01.298 --> 01:58:06.900]  The police have completely obliterated the Canadian Constitution and everything that we stand for.
[01:58:08.862 --> 01:58:15.876]  So yeah, more information is coming out and I'm sure, you know, it keeps getting more shocking by the minute.
[01:58:15.876 --> 01:58:18.481]  Give us your website where people can find out the latest information.
[01:58:19.238 --> 01:58:22.019]  Yeah, you can go to PressForTruth.ca.
[01:58:22.019 --> 01:58:29.783]  All the videos of Charlie's arrest and all of our pre-G20 reports can be found there at PressForTruth.ca.
[01:58:29.783 --> 01:58:30.763]  All right, stay there.
[01:58:30.763 --> 01:58:31.123]  Stay there.
[01:58:31.123 --> 01:58:33.904]  We'll be back in one minute, see if Charlie comes out.
[01:58:33.904 --> 01:58:37.066]  But that might be a disinfo operation they're running.
[01:58:37.066 --> 01:58:37.766]  We'll find out.
[01:58:37.766 --> 01:58:42.768]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.768 --> 01:58:45.369]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.172 --> 01:58:54.193]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:54.193 --> 01:58:59.514]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.514 --> 01:59:01.555]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:01.555 --> 01:59:06.556]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:06.556 --> 01:59:07.737]  How much do you want?
[01:59:07.737 --> 01:59:08.877]  When do you want it?
[01:59:08.877 --> 01:59:10.758]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:10.758 --> 01:59:11.838]  When will you need it?
[01:59:11.838 --> 01:59:14.039]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:14.039 --> 01:59:15.079]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.359 --> 01:59:16.879]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:16.879 --> 01:59:22.161]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:59:22.161 --> 01:59:25.742]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:59:25.742 --> 01:59:29.563]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:59:29.563 --> 01:59:30.783]  How much will you need?
[01:59:30.783 --> 01:59:31.683]  We don't know.
[01:59:31.683 --> 01:59:32.804]  How much do you want?
[01:59:32.804 --> 01:59:33.544]  All you can get.
[01:59:33.544 --> 01:59:34.504]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:34.824 --> 01:59:37.865]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:37.865 --> 01:59:38.385]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.385 --> 01:59:40.105]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:40.105 --> 01:59:41.085]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:41.085 --> 01:59:42.266]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:42.266 --> 01:59:44.106]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:10.473]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.473 --> 02:00:12.054]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.054 --> 02:00:13.615]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.615 --> 02:00:17.798]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.798 --> 02:00:21.841]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.628 --> 02:00:28.132]  All right, my friends, we've reached the halfway point in this transmission.
[02:00:28.132 --> 02:00:32.695]  It is Wednesday, the 30th day of June, 2010.
[02:00:32.695 --> 02:00:37.839]  Charlie Veitch, a journalist, political activist, filmmaker, was arrested once.
[02:00:37.839 --> 02:00:40.922]  The Toronto Star, CBC Television are reporting.
[02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:45.292]  That it was a non-existent law.
[02:00:45.292 --> 02:00:58.483]  The police were quoting a law saying you can't film, you know, you can't not give us your ID, it's a new emergency power, and they arrested him and 600 others, but he's the one person that's on video with them quoting the fake law.
[02:00:58.483 --> 02:01:01.466]  It hit national news the last three days that it was a fake law.
[02:01:02.711 --> 02:01:03.312]  I don't think so.
[02:01:18.388 --> 02:01:27.117]  And so, the police have charged him, even though he's saying, of course I'm being absurdist, and this is all, you know, absurdist film I'm making.
[02:01:27.117 --> 02:01:28.658]  You know, he's illustrating.
[02:01:28.658 --> 02:01:30.600]  He'll also say, I love the tyranny.
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:31.722]  It's so much fun.
[02:01:31.722 --> 02:01:33.423]  It's so good.
[02:01:33.423 --> 02:01:35.205]  All of us, we need more Big Brother.
[02:01:35.205 --> 02:01:40.070]  And of course, I've done that from time to time as well, being sarcastic.
[02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:45.761]  We've got people at the courthouse.
[02:01:45.761 --> 02:01:46.622]  They're having a hearing.
[02:01:46.622 --> 02:01:54.669]  He's either going to be charged and be allowed to leave the country, or if he pleads innocent, they're going to try to keep him.
[02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:59.853]  So as soon as we know something, it could happen in five minutes, it could happen in 30 minutes.
[02:01:59.853 --> 02:02:01.794]  Dan Dix is going into the hearing right now.
[02:02:02.455 --> 02:02:03.676]  They're going to have a press conference.
[02:02:03.676 --> 02:02:07.579]  There's a bunch of national media there, CBC, CTV, newspapers.
[02:02:07.579 --> 02:02:09.180]  I mean, just a giant throng.
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:11.801]  He was telling us on air and then off air elaborated.
[02:02:11.801 --> 02:02:14.443]  So he's dealing with that and we'll find out what's going on.
[02:02:14.443 --> 02:02:17.946]  But the good news is there's the press is still reporting on this.
[02:02:17.946 --> 02:02:24.130]  Now, separately, multiple women, including journalists, are reporting that police were threatening, I'll rape you.
[02:02:24.130 --> 02:02:28.493]  They were strip searching them over and over again and that they were also putting their fingers
[02:02:29.133 --> 02:02:35.455]  I don't want to get into it, but it constitutes rape if you use an object to do that.
[02:02:35.455 --> 02:02:40.737]  I hope this isn't true, but how many times have we heard about cops with toilet plungers and the rest of it?
[02:02:40.737 --> 02:02:44.218]  I mean, this just shows how sadistic and evil these governments have gotten.
[02:02:44.218 --> 02:02:51.281]  And you have snatch and grabs, men in plain clothes in black vans grabbing people, putting bags over their heads to terrorize the public.
[02:02:52.375 --> 02:02:57.499]  At the G20 last year in Pittsburgh, they were putting bags over people's heads.
[02:02:57.499 --> 02:02:58.620]  Rob, do witness this.
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:01.782]  I mean, snatching and grabbing and putting bags over your heads.
[02:03:01.782 --> 02:03:04.144]  It's meant to terrorize you.
[02:03:04.144 --> 02:03:09.108]  And the police now admit the black uniforms, the beating on the shields, it's all a PSYOP.
[02:03:09.648 --> 02:03:11.229]  And then who are they protecting?
[02:03:11.229 --> 02:03:16.333]  1.2 billion, the bankers, the international bankers, the establishment.
[02:03:16.333 --> 02:03:17.834]  Why is this going on?
[02:03:17.834 --> 02:03:23.978]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to directly go to Laura, Tim, John, Joe, and others that are holding.
[02:03:23.978 --> 02:03:27.420]  I'm going to get to John in London, John in Texas, and others.
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:33.425]  I'm going to go directly to your calls until about the bottom of the hour, and then I'm going to, in a controlled fashion,
[02:03:34.212 --> 02:03:42.737]  Because I tend to just go off in rabbit trails, going into so much detail, cover the latest on the oil spill, the latest on Iran, that's probably the most important.
[02:03:43.837 --> 02:03:56.439]  But in tandem with that, mainstream news reporting the end of the dollar, total collapse being designed, a new global currency run by private banks that you pay carbon taxes to them as a global tax.
[02:03:56.439 --> 02:03:58.320]  That is CNN.
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:02.380]  Dollars should be replaced, as International Standard UN Report says.
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:04.501]  What have I been telling you for a decade they would do?
[02:04:04.501 --> 02:04:05.541]  Because I read their own documents.
[02:04:05.541 --> 02:04:07.581]  They are now announcing it publicly.
[02:04:07.581 --> 02:04:11.462]  World government paying your taxes to private bankers, a new global currency.
[02:04:12.202 --> 02:04:15.204]  And that's all we had left in America was our dollar.
[02:04:15.204 --> 02:04:19.726]  And that, of course, dovetails with the New York Times, the Third Depression.
[02:04:19.726 --> 02:04:25.230]  RBS tells clients prepare for a monster money printing by the Federal Reserve.
[02:04:25.230 --> 02:04:28.812]  Banks financing Mexico gangs and the biggest drug cartels admitted.
[02:04:28.812 --> 02:04:30.212]  That's Bloomberg.
[02:04:30.212 --> 02:04:32.514]  And the banks run the narcotics.
[02:04:32.514 --> 02:04:33.534]  I mean, they launder all the money.
[02:04:35.055 --> 02:04:37.117]  The government created the illegal drug trade box.
[02:04:37.117 --> 02:04:41.181]  It's part of the congressional record.
[02:04:41.181 --> 02:04:42.302]  It's just all coming up.
[02:04:42.302 --> 02:04:44.884]  This is going to be a jam-packed transmission.
[02:04:44.884 --> 02:04:53.112]  We've got more info on Elena Kagan saying that she wouldn't stop the government from telling you what you're allowed to eat and when you're going to eat it.
[02:04:53.112 --> 02:04:54.593]  I mean, I'm entering the twilight zone.
[02:04:54.593 --> 02:04:55.914]  I know you are as well.
[02:04:55.914 --> 02:04:57.436]  This is an authoritarian takeover.
[02:04:57.436 --> 02:04:58.117]  We're fighting.
[02:04:58.117 --> 02:04:59.498]  They're hitting us on every angle.
[02:05:01.690 --> 02:05:08.132]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.

[02:07:12.882 --> 02:07:17.087]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:07:17.387 --> 02:07:19.728]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:07:19.728 --> 02:07:22.609]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:07:22.609 --> 02:07:25.531]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:07:25.531 --> 02:07:33.134]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:07:33.467 --> 02:07:38.872]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:07:38.872 --> 02:07:41.714]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:07:41.714 --> 02:07:45.397]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:07:45.397 --> 02:07:46.478]  And I got news for you.
[02:07:46.478 --> 02:07:47.819]  You're everyone else.
[02:07:47.819 --> 02:07:49.300]  Invisible Empire.

[02:08:01.488 --> 02:08:04.250]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:12.896]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.896 --> 02:08:14.297]  Okay, we're back live.
[02:08:14.297 --> 02:08:16.499]  Eight minutes into the third hour.
[02:08:16.499 --> 02:08:22.603]  Simulcasting a syndicated radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:22.603 --> 02:08:24.665]  The quickening is upon us.
[02:08:24.665 --> 02:08:26.106]  Everything is accelerating.
[02:08:26.106 --> 02:08:27.547]  Everything is just getting more intense.
[02:08:27.547 --> 02:08:28.488]  Kurt Nimmo the other day, he's...
[02:08:29.912 --> 02:08:35.697]  Visiting here in the office from New Mexico, he said, the news just gets crazier and crazier every day, every week.
[02:08:35.697 --> 02:08:36.798]  And I said, yeah.
[02:08:36.798 --> 02:08:38.020]  He said, when is it going to slow down?
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:39.341]  And I said, never.
[02:08:39.341 --> 02:08:45.927]  There's almost 7 billion people in the world.
[02:08:45.927 --> 02:08:48.449]  The elites of the planet are competing with each other.
[02:08:48.449 --> 02:08:50.851]  A world government's being established.
[02:08:50.851 --> 02:08:53.033]  There are more people on the Internet communicating.
[02:08:53.033 --> 02:08:54.955]  There's more news and information.
[02:08:54.955 --> 02:08:55.436]  So both
[02:08:57.011 --> 02:09:07.233]  Both more news is actually happening, more things are happening because there's more people, but also there's more people to report on what's happening, so we also know more of what's going on.
[02:09:07.233 --> 02:09:13.175]  Then there's also more disinformation, and then more accurate information, and then more confusion.
[02:09:13.175 --> 02:09:17.156]  It is just going to get crazier and crazier and crazier, and it's all coming at once.
[02:09:18.001 --> 02:09:43.610]  The global banking implosion by design, the attack on Iran being geared up, the staged oil spill, the blocking of the aid vessels, the takeover of the banking system domestically, and they're billing it as a reform, when even the Washington Post admitted, unlimited power to the Federal Reserve, 600 trillion in derivatives, they can take over any financial institution or anything that affects, that's in the bill,
[02:09:45.134 --> 02:09:46.674]  The financial system.
[02:09:46.674 --> 02:09:48.915]  I mean, it's just, you are dictator bankers!
[02:09:48.915 --> 02:09:51.195]  Thank you for robbing us!
[02:09:51.195 --> 02:10:10.499]  And you've got, Asia's corrupt, Latin America's corrupt, the Arabs are corrupt, Israel's corrupt, China's corrupt, the Russians are corrupt, I mean, it's evil in high places, and everything's getting more and more corrupt as other nations get more corrupt, that other nations trump them with more dirty tactics.
[02:10:10.499 --> 02:10:13.740]  And it's just, the world is going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:14.540]  I know you know that.
[02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:27.986]  And that's why good people have to get involved and really try to warn others and say no to evil, no to corruption, and offer the alternative to a despotic, evil society.
[02:10:27.986 --> 02:10:31.628]  Because things are only gonna get worse before they get better, historically, we know that.
[02:10:32.739 --> 02:10:35.260]  Philosophically, we understand that as a law of nature.
[02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:47.846]  But we have to have that alternative built and ready and demonstrated so people understand as things get worse, here's the alternative, or here's a group of alternatives.
[02:10:47.846 --> 02:10:48.827]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:10:48.827 --> 02:10:50.187]  We're gonna go to them and then all the news.
[02:10:50.187 --> 02:10:51.188]  It's all coming up.
[02:10:51.188 --> 02:10:53.649]  Laura in Iowa, and then John in London.
[02:10:53.649 --> 02:10:54.569]  Laura, you're on the air.
[02:10:54.569 --> 02:10:56.410]  Hi, Alex.
[02:10:56.410 --> 02:11:02.053]  I wanna let you know that I am extremely serious about hearing about the female reporters
[02:11:02.628 --> 02:11:05.729]  Being threatened of rape or being raped.
[02:11:05.729 --> 02:11:10.731]  I am a highly respected, high-ranking mixed martial artist.
[02:11:10.731 --> 02:11:11.831]  I'm an Oath Keeper.
[02:11:11.831 --> 02:11:16.673]  I'm also a TV reporter for In Your Face Television Network.
[02:11:16.673 --> 02:11:20.074]  And this is extremely disturbing news.
[02:11:20.074 --> 02:11:27.417]  In my martial arts school, there are goons coming in, like the police, are coming in to be trained in mixed martial arts.
[02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:30.612]  And who do you think they're going to use this stuff on?
[02:11:30.612 --> 02:11:31.974]  The American people.
[02:11:31.974 --> 02:11:34.156]  This extremely infuriates me.
[02:11:34.156 --> 02:11:35.076]  I am shaking.
[02:11:35.076 --> 02:11:41.222]  I am so mad at these people for doing to these women and the reporters, beating the children.
[02:11:41.222 --> 02:11:52.993]  Well, good cops should be mad, too, because all these videos of them tasering bedroom women and these videos of them beating up little kids and the videos of cops raping women, this is all coming out.
[02:11:53.853 --> 02:12:00.176]  And the establishment wants a war between the people and the police.
[02:12:00.176 --> 02:12:01.617]  They want us at each other's throats.
[02:12:01.617 --> 02:12:10.442]  We've got to somehow have these people rebuked so that we don't go into this self-fulfilling prophecy of an us-against-them system.
[02:12:11.860 --> 02:12:23.987]  And I would also recommend for all your viewers listening right now to join a mixed martial arts school, not a taekwondo academy, not a boxing academy, but a mixed martial arts.
[02:12:23.987 --> 02:12:33.893]  Because when they corner you in jail for speaking your free amendment right, to have free speech, and if they're cornering you and they say they're going to rape you, hurt you, kill you,
[02:12:34.403 --> 02:12:37.725]  That at least you have a chance to defend yourself when you're unarmed?
[02:12:37.725 --> 02:12:39.426]  Well, ma'am, that's called terrorism.
[02:12:39.426 --> 02:12:45.448]  I mean, according to their definition now, if a cop is raping your five-year-old daughter, you're not allowed to defend yourself.
[02:12:45.448 --> 02:12:46.709]  That's an act of terrorism.
[02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:50.731]  It's an act of love by the government to rape children and women and others.
[02:12:50.731 --> 02:12:51.471]  And I'm not joking.
[02:12:51.471 --> 02:12:53.673]  This happened at Abu Ghraib, and they call them patriots.
[02:12:53.673 --> 02:12:56.814]  They rape children with flashlights dripping with battery acid.
[02:12:56.814 --> 02:13:00.156]  That's in the Army report, the General Togumba report.
[02:13:00.156 --> 02:13:00.916]  And I'm not kidding.
[02:13:00.916 --> 02:13:02.117]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:13:02.937 --> 02:13:03.898]  I don't know.
[02:13:31.050 --> 02:13:40.360]  The problem is so many people then end up trying to rely just on their mixed martial arts instead of just explosively defending themselves.
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:43.042]  But it is important to know how to punch somebody in the throat.
[02:13:43.042 --> 02:13:47.527]  It is important to know how to mainly just gets me on the ground and stomp on their head.
[02:13:47.527 --> 02:13:49.349]  I mean, the quickest way to deal with somebody.
[02:13:49.349 --> 02:13:51.871]  But I mean, you can't talk about that with cops.
[02:13:51.871 --> 02:13:52.752]  You need to teach
[02:13:53.413 --> 02:14:03.746]  We need to teach our daughters and our mothers and our wives that when the government wants to rape them, to say, thank you God, please rape me.
[02:14:03.746 --> 02:14:04.447]  Oh, I love you.
[02:14:04.447 --> 02:14:06.510]  No, I'm being sarcastic, Laura.
[02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:09.513]  It's just that the level of government worship has gotten so sick.
[02:14:10.354 --> 02:14:17.117]  That now it's terrorism for you to even say that you would defend yourself if an officer was trying to rape you.
[02:14:17.117 --> 02:14:26.382]  Now, the common law in the United States says that if a cop outside of their duty and outside of their jurisdiction say tries to kill you, you have a right to defend yourself.
[02:14:26.382 --> 02:14:31.024]  And there's been a lot of cases of that, but they're trying to change the perception that
[02:14:31.684 --> 02:14:38.827]  I see court cases every day in the news where cops are beating someone with a billy club, so they raise their arm just to block the blow.
[02:14:38.827 --> 02:14:39.947]  That is assault.
[02:14:39.947 --> 02:14:42.888]  You are to say, please break my jaw for no reason.
[02:14:42.888 --> 02:14:44.029]  Please, I worship you.
[02:14:44.029 --> 02:14:44.829]  You are my king.
[02:14:44.829 --> 02:14:45.909]  You are my lord.
[02:14:45.909 --> 02:14:46.650]  You are the government.
[02:14:46.650 --> 02:14:47.970]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:47.970 --> 02:14:49.991]  John in London, you are on the air.
[02:14:49.991 --> 02:14:52.232]  I hope you don't talk about defending yourself.
[02:14:52.232 --> 02:14:58.754]  I hope you don't say that the Jews in Germany, when they were being run into pits to be shot in the back of the head, should have defended themselves.
[02:14:58.754 --> 02:15:00.735]  Of course, that's what I believe, but I'm a terrorist.
[02:15:01.335 --> 02:15:03.696]  Go ahead.
[02:15:03.696 --> 02:15:04.837]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:15:04.837 --> 02:15:07.438]  Yes, I can.
[02:15:07.438 --> 02:15:21.584]  If you wrote a letter about the New World Order and you persuaded some of your celebrity supporters to sign it, surely that letter could be used to wake up middle America within days.
[02:15:22.597 --> 02:15:22.917]  I don't know.
[02:15:22.917 --> 02:15:24.858]  People really don't listen to what Hollywood people say.
[02:15:24.858 --> 02:15:26.939]  And I've met a lot of Hollywood people.
[02:15:26.939 --> 02:15:31.701]  I've been told by a lot of high-power people they admire what I'm doing, but they're scared.
[02:15:31.701 --> 02:15:38.844]  And I've had a few big Hollywood people on the show, but then a lot of times they get so much heat.
[02:15:38.844 --> 02:15:44.206]  I mean, Willie Nelson came on and talked about 9-11 being an inside job, and he got death threats all over the place.
[02:15:44.206 --> 02:15:47.107]  His family just said, please, will you not have him on anymore?
[02:15:47.107 --> 02:15:48.168]  Dad really likes you.
[02:15:49.048 --> 02:15:56.931]  And he likes coming on, he'll come on if you ask him, but we're getting death threats and we're scared, so I haven't bugged Willie to come on in a year and a half, because of the death threats.
[02:15:56.931 --> 02:16:00.593]  Charlie Sheen got demonized and set up and lied about when he went public.
[02:16:00.593 --> 02:16:03.514]  Jesse Ventura's been demonized and lied about.
[02:16:03.514 --> 02:16:13.698]  And I know a lot of other people, even bigger than Willie Nelson, if you can believe that, bigger than Charlie Sheen, there's not many, bigger than Jesse Ventura that know, and they're not going to go public.
[02:16:13.698 --> 02:16:15.279]  Just because I've had dinner with somebody,
[02:16:15.959 --> 02:16:28.329]  Or had a phone conversation with somebody, or been in a meeting with someone, and they've confided, you know, hey, off the record, I really agree with you, and I know we're in danger, and, you know, thanks for what you're doing, and we'll, and I'll say, well, have you ever thought about going public?
[02:16:28.329 --> 02:16:33.373]  Hey, just destroy me, and, you know, you know, we're working on things, maybe someday.
[02:16:33.373 --> 02:16:41.040]  So, so, you know, I mean, I can't hardly persuade my wife on what color drapes I want in the house.
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:43.642]  So, I mean, it's not like I'm all powerful here or something.
[02:16:44.909 --> 02:16:52.851]  Well, if you wrote it, I'm sure that some of them could be persuaded to sign it, and they would have safety in numbers as well, wouldn't they?
[02:16:52.851 --> 02:17:01.774]  Well, now, that's been discussed behind the scenes, and I've actually tried what you're talking about, and the people just chickened out and said no.
[02:17:01.774 --> 02:17:06.555]  I was thinking it would be like Charlie Sheen's letter to the President, but giving the full picture.
[02:17:09.841 --> 02:17:12.343]  Well, you know, Charlie Sheen is not an angel.
[02:17:12.343 --> 02:17:13.304]  None of us are.
[02:17:13.304 --> 02:17:16.868]  And it's because he is a maverick and an original person.
[02:17:16.868 --> 02:17:20.992]  And the things the media talks about are exaggerated in a very small part of who he is.
[02:17:20.992 --> 02:17:21.772]  I know him very well.
[02:17:21.772 --> 02:17:23.094]  We're really good friends.
[02:17:23.094 --> 02:17:24.895]  Spent a lot of time with him.
[02:17:24.895 --> 02:17:26.597]  But look at what they did to him.
[02:17:26.597 --> 02:17:30.320]  And then he was told, people involved with a production to make a movie
[02:17:31.801 --> 02:17:40.647]  About 9-11, we're told, a high-powered producer was called and told, your children aren't going to be safe if you do this.
[02:17:40.647 --> 02:17:44.069]  They were called by a military officer.
[02:17:44.069 --> 02:17:46.390]  In fact, they were called by a general.
[02:17:46.390 --> 02:17:48.612]  And they were told, your children are not safe if you do this.
[02:17:48.612 --> 02:17:49.612]  I'm just here to give you a warning.
[02:17:49.612 --> 02:17:52.254]  I'm not threatening your kids, but your kids are going to be targets.
[02:17:53.548 --> 02:17:58.171]  Uh, and then you saw Bill O'Reilly get on the news and say, Charlie Sheen, you're not going to make it.
[02:17:58.171 --> 02:18:00.093]  Something bad's going to happen to you.
[02:18:00.093 --> 02:18:03.155]  Just like a mobster, he said, you understand me, son?
[02:18:03.155 --> 02:18:05.557]  You don't make this movie.
[02:18:05.557 --> 02:18:08.879]  I mean, and even other news said, my God, it was like a mafia threat.
[02:18:08.879 --> 02:18:12.501]  And then I said I couldn't talk about it because I was asked not to talk about it.
[02:18:12.501 --> 02:18:18.606]  Mark Cuban separately was going to fund a theatrical release of a, you know, loose change, big budget film.
[02:18:19.927 --> 02:18:30.829]  And then the FTC, Federal Trade Commission, called him and emailed him, and this came out in the New York Times, and said, listen, we're gonna prosecute you if you don't drop this film.
[02:18:30.829 --> 02:18:32.490]  And Mark Cuban did drop it.
[02:18:32.490 --> 02:18:39.411]  He just said, listen, I just put out controversial stuff, and I'm not even, you know, I'm not gonna do this.
[02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:41.252]  And they still indicted him.
[02:18:41.252 --> 02:18:43.952]  This came out in the New York Times a year after I couldn't talk about it.
[02:18:43.952 --> 02:18:45.253]  I just said he was threatened.
[02:18:45.253 --> 02:18:46.173]  This was in the New York Times.
[02:18:47.634 --> 02:18:53.401]  And they indicted him for something like $400,000 trade, which the guy's worth like $5 billion, $6 billion.
[02:18:53.401 --> 02:18:54.462]  It was nothing.
[02:18:54.462 --> 02:18:55.964]  He didn't even, it was an auto trade.
[02:18:55.964 --> 02:18:58.126]  They claimed it was insider trading.
[02:18:58.126 --> 02:19:01.630]  I mean, even when he backed off, they said, doesn't matter, indict him.
[02:19:01.630 --> 02:19:04.814]  And he said, I'm not going to plead guilty to this.
[02:19:04.814 --> 02:19:06.196]  I didn't do this.
[02:19:06.196 --> 02:19:08.418]  And so I mean,
[02:19:09.133 --> 02:19:14.416]  Ron Paul is now being investigated by the Federal Elections Commission.
[02:19:14.416 --> 02:19:17.358]  He says that he is being attacked, and this is persecution.
[02:19:17.358 --> 02:19:20.700]  The story is up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:24.463]  I mean, Ron Paul, who is as pure as the driven snow.
[02:19:24.463 --> 02:19:26.564]  I mean, he is as close to a saint as you can get.
[02:19:26.564 --> 02:19:29.166]  Pious, works 17 hours a day.
[02:19:29.166 --> 02:19:33.609]  He is the real McCoy, and he is now under massive federal attack.
[02:19:33.609 --> 02:19:35.230]  I haven't even gotten to that yet today.
[02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:37.571]  I get death threats.
[02:19:39.943 --> 02:19:41.845]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a game.
[02:19:41.845 --> 02:19:44.908]  But I understand your point, John.
[02:19:44.908 --> 02:19:51.294]  We need scientists and Nobel laureates and people in the establishment to get past their fear and come out.
[02:19:51.294 --> 02:19:52.915]  They can't stop us all.
[02:19:52.915 --> 02:19:56.198]  But they do try to destroy people so that they are scared.
[02:19:56.198 --> 02:19:58.941]  And when they indicted Mark Cuban, that sent a message through Hollywood.
[02:20:01.923 --> 02:20:03.163]  Global meltdowns.
[02:20:03.163 --> 02:20:04.564]  Massive unemployment.
[02:20:04.564 --> 02:20:05.784]  Endless wars.
[02:20:05.784 --> 02:20:07.425]  A new currency crisis.
[02:20:07.425 --> 02:20:09.506]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:20:09.506 --> 02:20:11.666]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:11.666 --> 02:20:13.567]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:20:13.567 --> 02:20:15.628]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[02:20:15.628 --> 02:20:17.628]  Introducing Off The Grid News.

[02:22:02.159 --> 02:22:05.521]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:22:05.521 --> 02:22:13.705]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.

[02:22:30.493 --> 02:22:31.754]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.754 --> 02:22:36.317]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.317 --> 02:22:42.121]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:42.121 --> 02:22:45.763]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.763 --> 02:22:48.485]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.485 --> 02:22:53.548]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:53.548 --> 02:22:53.789]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.789 --> 02:22:55.190]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.853 --> 02:23:09.557]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:23:09.557 --> 02:23:14.699]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[02:23:14.699 --> 02:23:15.560]  and Canada.
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:22.663]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:23:22.663 --> 02:23:25.924]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:23:26.084 --> 02:23:28.505]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:24:26.277 --> 02:24:31.540]  I mean, that's what goes on in this country.
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:34.222]  That's how criminal these people are.
[02:24:34.222 --> 02:24:35.703]  And now they're going after Ron Paul.
[02:24:35.703 --> 02:24:36.604]  That's coming up.
[02:24:36.604 --> 02:24:40.766]  And Ron Paul's scheduled to be on the show tomorrow.
[02:24:40.766 --> 02:24:43.288]  He was set up before this came out, but this is perfect timing.
[02:24:43.288 --> 02:24:49.672]  And he says in his press release that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com that this is an attack.
[02:24:49.672 --> 02:24:51.213]  They are totally above board.
[02:24:51.213 --> 02:24:54.195]  All their filings are on record.
[02:24:54.195 --> 02:24:55.496]  And they are
[02:24:56.789 --> 02:24:58.931]  Getting donations at Campaign for Liberty.
[02:24:58.931 --> 02:25:02.553]  They're running candidates all over the country that are winning in the primaries.
[02:25:02.553 --> 02:25:04.214]  They are the real Tea Party.
[02:25:04.214 --> 02:25:06.676]  And here comes the mafia, the Chicago mob.
[02:25:06.676 --> 02:25:13.141]  And you know, Mayor Daley's saying, you don't get to, you Americans don't get to have guns and you don't get to elect who you want.
[02:25:13.141 --> 02:25:14.922]  Because I'm the mob boss.
[02:25:14.922 --> 02:25:15.963]  Is that clear there?
[02:25:15.963 --> 02:25:18.265]  That Ron Paul ain't gonna do nothing.
[02:25:18.265 --> 02:25:20.066]  This is our country now.
[02:25:20.066 --> 02:25:22.388]  The banks is in here and they're taking over.
[02:25:25.868 --> 02:25:26.669]  Okay, that's enough.
[02:25:26.669 --> 02:25:28.129]  I'm going to shut up now.
[02:25:28.129 --> 02:25:31.832]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Jersey.
[02:25:31.832 --> 02:25:32.612]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:25:32.612 --> 02:25:34.694]  Welcome.
[02:25:34.694 --> 02:25:35.754]  Hey, Alex.
[02:25:35.754 --> 02:25:39.957]  I just wanted to first say, great job on the opening in Anthony's show.
[02:25:39.957 --> 02:25:43.139]  I probably got out to a lot of people.
[02:25:43.139 --> 02:25:44.900]  Yeah, they had millions and millions of listeners.
[02:25:44.900 --> 02:25:45.801]  Thank you.
[02:25:45.801 --> 02:25:47.742]  Yes, it was very well done.
[02:25:47.742 --> 02:25:51.444]  But I wanted to say, I did attend CG20 Summit.
[02:25:51.444 --> 02:25:53.325]  I was able to get across the border.
[02:25:53.325 --> 02:25:54.006]  I had to lie.
[02:25:54.969 --> 02:25:59.492]  Anyway, I was there Sunday, and I attended a protest.
[02:25:59.492 --> 02:26:21.128]  It was completely peaceful, and we ended up marching, and I ended up in the Queen and Spadina 10, that they literally came and surrounded on all four streets, and started marching, and had, like, innocent pedestrians
[02:26:21.977 --> 02:26:29.381]  They had penned us in for four hours in the rain with never any warning to disperse.
[02:26:29.381 --> 02:26:37.306]  Luckily, my friend and I, we, um, I convinced them that some of the cops on the front line, I talked to them.
[02:26:37.306 --> 02:26:40.588]  Some of them were like, yes, we are riot police.
[02:26:40.588 --> 02:26:42.049]  We are trained to stay here.
[02:26:42.049 --> 02:26:43.710]  We can't do anything.
[02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:45.791]  I'm like, so you're just following orders.
[02:26:45.791 --> 02:26:51.074]  But then luckily a cop medic in the back, somehow she's,
[02:26:51.633 --> 02:27:00.779]  Well, I mean, there's video of them beating up little kids, beating up London Guardian reporters, and now the reporters are saying that they were threatening to rape them and were.
[02:27:21.135 --> 02:27:24.497]  Putting their fingers inside the women, it's just unbelievable.
[02:27:24.497 --> 02:27:25.158]  And you know what?
[02:27:25.158 --> 02:27:27.659]  My gut tells me it's all true.
[02:27:27.659 --> 02:27:31.882]  The reporters that are saying this look very credible, sound very credible.
[02:27:31.882 --> 02:27:38.346]  And I mean, I just can't believe there are men that are like that.
[02:27:38.346 --> 02:27:40.727]  I mean, what are men doing strip-searching women to begin with?
[02:27:40.727 --> 02:27:42.809]  In fact, did you guys find that video I asked for earlier?
[02:27:42.809 --> 02:27:44.150]  Women strip-searched by police?
[02:27:45.311 --> 02:27:53.856]  If you go to YouTube, there's a bunch of them, but there's one where she's just screaming and screaming and they're just grabbing her breast and grabbing her... It's extremely powerful.
[02:27:53.856 --> 02:27:55.457]  It's extremely powerful.
[02:27:55.457 --> 02:27:58.359]  But this is all part of the humiliation.
[02:27:58.359 --> 02:27:59.720]  We know where this goes.
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:03.522]  We know when you militarize police, they then see the public as their enemy.
[02:28:03.522 --> 02:28:05.063]  They begin waging war against us.
[02:28:05.063 --> 02:28:07.285]  Tim, I appreciate your call.
[02:28:07.285 --> 02:28:08.766]  Let's go to Joe in Texas.
[02:28:08.766 --> 02:28:09.646]  You're on the air, Joe.
[02:28:09.646 --> 02:28:12.228]  Hello, Alex.
[02:28:12.228 --> 02:28:12.528]  Hey, buddy.
[02:28:13.479 --> 02:28:15.240]  Hey, Alex, I just called, sir.
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:18.402]  I know the subject is on the G20.
[02:28:18.402 --> 02:28:19.483]  No, it's on everything!
[02:28:19.483 --> 02:28:20.744]  It's on everything.
[02:28:20.744 --> 02:28:31.091]  Well, I just, Alex, I know how you document everything, brother, and I just had an article real quick that has to do on the gun sales, on gunsmiths.
[02:28:31.091 --> 02:28:38.056]  I've talked to you before, but there's an article here that just states quickly that
[02:28:38.757 --> 02:28:41.280]  Some in law enforcement continue to fill a pinch.
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:48.126]  Sheriff Dave Medlin in Overland County, Texas, has stated that ammunition availability continues to be a problem.
[02:28:48.126 --> 02:28:54.112]  He says, I am still seeing ammo shortages from the retail stores in the Amarillo area.
[02:28:55.126 --> 02:29:00.827]  And I'm having difficulty replacing my existing stock on training and duty ammo.
[02:29:00.827 --> 02:29:03.388]  Oh yeah, because the government's buying up most of the ammo.
[02:29:03.388 --> 02:29:05.268]  They're not allowing foreign ammo in.
[02:29:05.268 --> 02:29:07.189]  And there are ammo shortages everywhere.
[02:29:07.189 --> 02:29:09.789]  And ammo has more than doubled in the last year and a half.
[02:29:09.789 --> 02:29:10.949]  But that's the good news.
[02:29:10.949 --> 02:29:15.070]  Because it's not just the shortages from manufacturing or the military buying it.
[02:29:15.070 --> 02:29:17.011]  The citizens are buying it up.
[02:29:17.011 --> 02:29:20.792]  Last time I checked, 18 million guns have been sold since Obama's in.
[02:29:20.792 --> 02:29:22.312]  I'm sure it's got to be 20 million by now.
[02:29:23.152 --> 02:29:26.295]  And so, uh, what do you make of this, uh, Joe?
[02:29:26.295 --> 02:29:39.948]  Uh, well, I'm, I'm, I believe exactly because, and this was, I've, uh, had numerous students comment to me that their departments have been forced to limit the amounts they can order.
[02:29:39.948 --> 02:29:45.212]  Certainly if cops in Texas are complaining about ammo supply manufacturers, I'm not completely caught up with the man.
[02:29:45.212 --> 02:29:48.135]  Stay there, let's finish up, John, and, and, and get to the crux of what you're saying.
[02:29:48.135 --> 02:29:48.876]  Sounds important.
[02:29:51.314 --> 02:29:55.216]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.216 --> 02:30:00.799]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.799 --> 02:30:02.440]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.440 --> 02:30:05.822]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[02:30:24.774 --> 02:30:31.278]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[02:30:54.151 --> 02:30:54.592]  Thank you!
[02:31:00.441 --> 02:31:05.425]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:31:05.425 --> 02:31:06.405]  What have we got?
[02:31:06.405 --> 02:31:08.867]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:31:08.867 --> 02:31:09.868]  A republic.
[02:31:09.868 --> 02:31:12.510]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:31:12.510 --> 02:31:14.772]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:31:14.772 --> 02:31:16.793]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:31:16.793 --> 02:31:18.474]  So they think they own our land?
[02:31:18.474 --> 02:31:19.795]  They think they own our water?
[02:31:19.795 --> 02:31:20.416]  Children?
[02:31:20.416 --> 02:31:21.537]  Our education?
[02:31:21.537 --> 02:31:22.357]  Our money?
[02:31:22.357 --> 02:31:26.020]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:31.366]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:31:31.366 --> 02:31:32.367]  We have the facts.
[02:31:32.367 --> 02:31:33.528]  We have the Constitution.
[02:31:33.528 --> 02:31:34.430]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:31:34.430 --> 02:31:35.331]  We have common law.
[02:31:35.331 --> 02:31:37.854]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:37.854 --> 02:31:40.797]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:31:40.797 --> 02:31:41.618]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:31:41.718 --> 02:31:46.684]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:31:46.684 --> 02:31:48.186]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:31:48.186 --> 02:31:49.268]  Don't tread on me.
[02:31:49.268 --> 02:31:56.137]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:32:00.222 --> 02:32:04.764]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.764 --> 02:32:05.685]  Number 1.
[02:32:05.685 --> 02:32:09.106]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.106 --> 02:32:09.966]  Number 2.
[02:32:09.966 --> 02:32:14.849]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:14.849 --> 02:32:15.609]  It's true.
[02:32:15.609 --> 02:32:20.471]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.471 --> 02:32:21.292]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.292 --> 02:32:24.893]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:24.893 --> 02:32:28.595]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.795 --> 02:32:29.596]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.596 --> 02:32:32.359]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.359 --> 02:32:36.043]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.043 --> 02:32:36.823]  Number 5.
[02:32:36.823 --> 02:32:40.968]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:40.968 --> 02:32:45.733]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:51.975 --> 02:32:54.216]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:33:01.578 --> 02:33:08.600]  Well, the disturbing video that we showed you last night might not be the only video that was shot in this controversial case.
[02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:13.882]  The investigator Tom Meyer has more tonight with part two of his exclusive investigation.
[02:33:14.707 --> 02:33:17.368]  Why did you decide to talk with me?
[02:33:17.368 --> 02:33:22.449]  I don't want this to happen to somebody else.
[02:33:22.449 --> 02:33:32.571]  Greg Steffi and his wife Hope are suing the Stark County Sheriff, accusing deputies of using excessive and outrageous force, an allegation the Sheriff denies.
[02:33:32.571 --> 02:33:38.633]  But Steffi says this video, shot by deputies and obtained by Channel 3 News, speaks for itself.
[02:33:43.041 --> 02:33:46.563]  This case got started with a call to 911 for help.
[02:33:46.563 --> 02:33:49.785]  Greg's wife was injured when a cousin assaulted her.
[02:33:49.785 --> 02:33:54.828]  When she had someone call the Stark County Sheriff, her troubles got worse.
[02:33:54.828 --> 02:33:56.709]  A lot worse.
[02:33:56.709 --> 02:34:01.592]  They say a deputy was confused when he arrived at the location where the attack occurred.
[02:34:01.592 --> 02:34:07.476]  They say he began treating the injured Steffi not as the victim, but as the troublemaker.
[02:34:07.476 --> 02:34:10.478]  He proceeded to pick her up off the ground.
[02:34:11.718 --> 02:34:19.960]  And slam her onto the ground.
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:26.501]  Women were reportedly being raped by the Toronto Police.
[02:34:26.501 --> 02:34:29.361]  That was in the news today.
[02:34:29.361 --> 02:34:32.562]  A giant armada of U.S.
[02:34:32.562 --> 02:34:35.962]  and Israeli ships was openly saying they may nuke Iran.
[02:34:35.962 --> 02:34:38.623]  That's what I read in the news today.
[02:34:39.781 --> 02:34:46.250]  I read in the news today that a congressional delegation is being blocked from being able to go down and see what's happening in the Gulf.
[02:34:46.250 --> 02:34:49.635]  Why don't they just ignore Obama and do what they want?
[02:34:49.635 --> 02:34:51.497]  He can't tell them that.
[02:34:51.497 --> 02:34:55.223]  The government says I have to have permission to breathe, so I'm going to stop breathing.
[02:34:57.622 --> 02:35:00.804]  And you turn purple and die because the government said so.
[02:35:00.804 --> 02:35:04.127]  I mean, the government says I've got to pay a carbon tax to breathe.
[02:35:04.127 --> 02:35:05.668]  They're actually doing that now.
[02:35:05.668 --> 02:35:07.109]  So I better do it.
[02:35:07.109 --> 02:35:15.075]  Since when do we let these arrogant packs of criminals who dress in fancy suits sit up there and tell us we're all scum and that we're their property?
[02:35:15.075 --> 02:35:17.938]  Let's go back now to the calls because I'm about to get into a bunch of news here.
[02:35:18.798 --> 02:35:20.261]  Let's finish these calls quick.
[02:35:20.261 --> 02:35:25.913]  Joe in Texas, you're saying, I guess from what you say, you're training police.
[02:35:25.913 --> 02:35:29.240]  That's the gist of what I got, and they're all telling you they're having ammo shortages.
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:29.560]  Go ahead.
[02:35:31.185 --> 02:35:31.585]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:01.025 --> 02:36:12.571]  Well that's what the Violence Policy Center and others have said.
[02:36:12.571 --> 02:36:17.973]  They said we're going to shut down the gun industry by suing them and by prosecuting them and the ammo.
[02:36:17.973 --> 02:36:27.278]  And now Schwarzenegger got the law passed where all guns sold in California must stamp a number on the shell casing when you pull the trigger and then that will make
[02:36:28.158 --> 02:36:35.160]  Basically, gun manufacturers won't be able to make guns because there's a very expensive patent for it that are just sold in California.
[02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:37.080]  I mean, they're destroying our Second Amendment.
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:44.322]  Look, Sotomayor swore that she would uphold the Second Amendment and believed it was an individual right just, what, six, eight months ago.
[02:36:44.322 --> 02:36:50.343]  And then she voted to ban guns in the ruling that came down Monday, but thank God she was overruled.
[02:36:50.343 --> 02:36:55.424]  She called for a complete gun ban, four to nine, four to five out of the nine.
[02:36:56.704 --> 02:37:02.730]  But in the majority decision, it now says, well, the government can still restrict under law.
[02:37:02.730 --> 02:37:04.372]  So it's not really a complete victory.
[02:37:04.372 --> 02:37:07.535]  In fact, I see it as an overall defeat.
[02:37:07.535 --> 02:37:09.277]  But very, very suspicious, Joe.
[02:37:09.277 --> 02:37:10.098]  I appreciate your call.
[02:37:11.803 --> 02:37:12.063]  I don't know.
[02:37:31.141 --> 02:37:32.542]  I think I remember, I think it was under Clinton.
[02:37:32.542 --> 02:37:33.722]  I was reading in the paper that the
[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:10.984]  Yes, and there were a few left under Bush, and then Obama shut them completely down, and they don't allow us to import ammo.
[02:38:10.984 --> 02:38:18.548]  They stopped letting the Army sell its brass to reloaders, big companies, so that increased prices.
[02:38:18.548 --> 02:38:18.868]  Go ahead.
[02:38:24.141 --> 02:38:24.761]  Yeah, I know.
[02:38:24.761 --> 02:38:25.142]  You know Alex,
[02:38:46.946 --> 02:38:52.970]  Well, what I wanted to really talk about was, you know, the World War II generation is almost gone.
[02:38:52.970 --> 02:38:54.452]  I'm a baby boomer.
[02:38:54.452 --> 02:38:55.512]  I was born in 1949.
[02:38:55.512 --> 02:38:57.714]  I'm 60 years old now.
[02:38:57.714 --> 02:39:01.597]  When we're gone, nobody in this country is going to realize the freedoms we used to have.
[02:39:01.597 --> 02:39:05.240]  They're going to think that what's going on today has always been normal, you know?
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:11.784]  The reason I'm talking about this is about that kid that went to school with the toy soldiers on his hat, you know, and they kicked him out.
[02:39:11.784 --> 02:39:12.485]  Well, when I was in
[02:39:13.015 --> 02:39:16.657]  Elementary school in the 1950s, we always took toy soldiers to school.
[02:39:16.657 --> 02:39:20.399]  We used to take toy guns to school and play Cowboys and Indians out on the playground.
[02:39:20.399 --> 02:39:24.141]  We used to take Jackknives to school, Boy Scout Jackknives, and nothing was ever said about it.
[02:39:24.141 --> 02:39:29.785]  My dad took his shotgun to school, and he was in a pretty big rural school, and put it in his locker.
[02:39:29.785 --> 02:39:32.826]  They would ride on the school buses with .22s and shotguns.
[02:39:32.826 --> 02:39:34.427]  They never had school shootings.
[02:39:34.427 --> 02:39:36.749]  We were not a domesticated, castrated,
[02:39:37.569 --> 02:39:53.946]  Population and when the United States went to war people were in deep trouble Because in Europe they hadn't had guns for hundreds of years and didn't know how to use them even though they've been trained they just weren't as good as people like Audie Murphy from Texas and That culture is dying and I mean just in New York.
[02:39:53.946 --> 02:39:58.290]  They had shooting clubs in Manhattan they had shooting clubs for the young people and
[02:39:59.281 --> 02:40:06.493]  They are killing that culture, they are creating domesticated slaves, and they're doing a great job of it.
[02:40:06.493 --> 02:40:09.317]  And the point you make, I see articles every few weeks.
[02:40:10.763 --> 02:40:14.364]  About child brings army man to school, arrested.
[02:40:14.364 --> 02:40:17.285]  Child brings toy Star Wars gun.
[02:40:17.285 --> 02:40:18.666]  It was less than two inches long.
[02:40:18.666 --> 02:40:20.926]  Remember that one a couple months ago?
[02:40:20.926 --> 02:40:24.167]  And the new one, he had an army man on his hat.
[02:40:24.167 --> 02:40:27.629]  And so they were freaking out.
[02:40:27.629 --> 02:40:29.649]  The images, the government's got all these guns.
[02:40:29.649 --> 02:40:31.230]  They're armed to the teeth.
[02:40:31.230 --> 02:40:33.551]  They can beat you, kill you whenever they want.
[02:40:33.551 --> 02:40:35.991]  But you can't even have the image of a gun.
[02:40:35.991 --> 02:40:37.612]  And I see reports constantly about
[02:40:38.826 --> 02:40:44.955]  Junior high students who will write an essay and it'll have zombies or wars.
[02:40:44.955 --> 02:40:48.560]  I mean, I wrote those in English class and got A pluses and they arrest them.
[02:40:49.491 --> 02:40:54.075]  Even though it's a fictitious school in another country, in one case, with zombies.
[02:40:54.075 --> 02:40:56.877]  And I actually got an A plus for a zombie story in middle school.
[02:40:56.877 --> 02:40:58.018]  I remember getting that.
[02:40:58.018 --> 02:41:02.061]  And the teacher picked me out to read it before the class and thought it was a great story.
[02:41:02.061 --> 02:41:07.005]  And because, you know, if kids see these zombie movies on TV, then you write an article about it.
[02:41:07.005 --> 02:41:09.446]  And so it's thought crime.
[02:41:09.446 --> 02:41:15.871]  And if you want to know how they phase it in generationally, if you think what you see on TV and the culture is domesticated and enslaved,
[02:41:17.453 --> 02:41:25.266]  John, if you actually see now what's in the schools, it is like the Twilight Zone, 1984.
[02:41:25.266 --> 02:41:26.328]  Any other points, John?
[02:41:28.103 --> 02:41:32.826]  Yeah, well, when I was in high school in the early 60s, we didn't have such a thing as school police.
[02:41:32.826 --> 02:41:34.587]  I'd never seen a cop in school.
[02:41:34.587 --> 02:41:39.390]  And, uh, one time somebody sent off a cherry bomb in school, you know, it used to be a big firecracker.
[02:41:39.390 --> 02:41:46.235]  And they got mad about it and went on to Intercom and said everybody caught with a firecracker would be kicked out of school, but they didn't call a cop, they didn't call ATF.
[02:41:46.235 --> 02:41:50.778]  And if the guy would have got caught, he'd have got kicked out for three days, and then your mother and dad had to come get you back in, but that was it.
[02:41:51.118 --> 02:41:54.480]  No, he would have been probably taken out and made to run.
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:56.080]  That's cruel and unusual.
[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:00.282]  See, they always restrict regular training and discipline that'll make us be upright.
[02:42:00.282 --> 02:42:03.544]  And then once we're out of control, then they totally enslave us.
[02:42:03.544 --> 02:42:06.925]  I mean, you know, the children's movie Pinocchio explains it all.
[02:42:08.206 --> 02:42:23.423]  The way the system wants you to be corrupt so they can compromise you, and they would have been run around the football field until they threw up, then they would have been given pops, then they would have been sent home for three days, and then their parents would have whooped their butt.
[02:42:25.581 --> 02:42:28.123]  Well, one more thing before I go, Alex.
[02:42:28.123 --> 02:42:29.203]  Talking about guns.
[02:42:29.203 --> 02:42:33.305]  I remember going with my dad to a pawn shop back in about 1959.
[02:42:33.305 --> 02:42:35.086]  He wanted to buy a deer rifle.
[02:42:35.086 --> 02:42:36.847]  He went in there and he picked out the gun he wanted.
[02:42:36.847 --> 02:42:40.549]  He put the money on the counter, walked out, and that was it.
[02:42:40.549 --> 02:42:44.551]  You could send, if you wanted a deer rifle or a gun, you could send a check in the mail.
[02:42:44.551 --> 02:42:46.011]  The Sears Roebuck.
[02:42:46.011 --> 02:42:46.832]  The Sears Roebuck.
[02:42:46.832 --> 02:42:48.132]  I hear you, John.
[02:42:48.132 --> 02:42:51.154]  My son's reading a book, A Boy and the Big Bear or something.
[02:42:51.154 --> 02:42:51.954]  It's published 1954.
[02:42:53.895 --> 02:43:02.979]  And the whole thing is the six-year-old kid out hunting bears with his rifle, and then he finds a baby bear and decides not to kill it, and then raises it, and then has trouble with it.
[02:43:02.979 --> 02:43:06.941]  But the point is, you know, that was an award-winning book.
[02:43:06.941 --> 02:43:11.183]  It says it won the National Award for Schools and was put in schools nationwide in 1954.
[02:43:13.084 --> 02:43:16.408]  And now, I mean, this book is like completely alien.
[02:43:16.408 --> 02:43:18.190]  They want us domesticated.
[02:43:18.190 --> 02:43:29.905]  Then they have select paramilitary guilds where you're allowed to be macho and allowed to be manly, but it's a false distortion of a bunch of soft weaklings in commando outfits beating up women.
[02:43:31.345 --> 02:43:33.725]  I mean, I've seen these cops, folks, and they are pathetic.
[02:43:33.725 --> 02:43:34.766]  I mean, they're just weak.
[02:43:34.766 --> 02:43:36.206]  You look in their eyes.
[02:43:36.206 --> 02:43:40.887]  A real warrior, somebody who's really strong, wants to fight other warriors.
[02:43:40.887 --> 02:43:45.568]  I mean, it's just totally sick.
[02:43:45.568 --> 02:43:52.829]  It's really a bunch of limp-wristed people in big fancy battle outfits, and they just love cornering a woman and beating the hell out of her.
[02:43:52.829 --> 02:43:54.770]  And I'm not saying all police are like that.
[02:43:54.770 --> 02:43:55.330]  You can tell a
[02:43:56.380 --> 02:44:02.145]  You know, a cop, I mean, it seems like the bigger and the tougher and the meaner the cop is, the nicer they are.
[02:44:02.145 --> 02:44:05.728]  It's always these, I hate to say it, it's like these liberal cops.
[02:44:05.728 --> 02:44:07.249]  They're just women cops.
[02:44:07.249 --> 02:44:10.452]  And I'm not saying all women cops, but you know, I've just, I've noticed it.
[02:44:10.452 --> 02:44:11.633]  They got something to prove.
[02:44:11.633 --> 02:44:12.613]  They're scared.
[02:44:12.613 --> 02:44:14.415]  They're, they're cowards.
[02:44:14.415 --> 02:44:15.496]  They're domesticated.
[02:44:15.496 --> 02:44:19.960]  I mean, if you're not really strong and you don't want to protect people, you shouldn't be a cop.
[02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:24.883]  And if you like to abuse people, you don't need to be a cop.
[02:44:24.883 --> 02:44:27.385]  But instead, they want the sicko abusers.
[02:44:27.385 --> 02:44:29.746]  They want the people that have problems.
[02:44:29.746 --> 02:44:31.908]  They want the people that are wimps.
[02:44:31.908 --> 02:44:36.250]  They don't want people that are peacemakers, that are peace officers, who are negotiators.
[02:44:36.250 --> 02:44:44.016]  I hate to use a popular culture example, but was Matt Dillon out just... because that's a good example of a... I've actually read the histories of a good sheriff.
[02:44:44.716 --> 02:44:50.798]  I mean, it's a little overblown and you know, he was in a lot more, you know, in the fictitious gun smoke than a sheriff really would be.
[02:44:50.798 --> 02:44:53.799]  But in some cases, there were some sheriffs that were in that type of action.
[02:44:53.799 --> 02:44:59.980]  But the issue is, he was out walking softly, carrying a big stick, not looking for trouble, being friendly.
[02:44:59.980 --> 02:45:03.902]  He knew how to negotiate with people, but that if he had to be rough, he would be.
[02:45:03.902 --> 02:45:08.103]  That's what you're supposed to have in a lawman, not just some arrogant,
[02:45:08.783 --> 02:45:09.864]  We're good to go.
[02:45:32.506 --> 02:45:37.628]  I mean, you shouldn't be a cop if you can't handle, oh, an old lady got smart mouth with me, tasered!
[02:45:37.628 --> 02:45:40.969]  If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen!
[02:45:40.969 --> 02:45:53.274]  I mean, it's a bunch of, look, these are all spoiled, rotten kids, who mommy gave them everything, and they were bullies in school, and now they're a cop, and everybody's gotta bow down to them.
[02:45:53.274 --> 02:45:54.414]  I'm not doing it, okay?
[02:45:54.414 --> 02:45:55.355]  I'm done.
[02:45:55.355 --> 02:45:58.736]  I know thugs when I see it, I know cowards when I see it, and I've had enough.
[02:46:00.265 --> 02:46:04.007]  Let me see, we got Micah, New Orleans, Kathy, George, Ronnie, and many others.
[02:46:04.007 --> 02:46:11.510]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231, and I'll get to more of your calls, come up in an hour.
[02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:15.031]  An hour is only 14 minutes away.
[02:46:15.031 --> 02:46:28.937]  I need to go ahead and get into all the news, and I almost want to cut up these pieces I do live here on air, and then post it on PrisonPlanet.tv as vignettes
[02:46:29.810 --> 02:46:50.800]  You know, as separate thoughts, so that it's not just caught in the wider stream of calls and guests and my ramblings, because the information I'm about to cover here is just of import that is so great, it's even mind-blowing to me, somebody who just constantly studies this information.
[02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:56.043]  But let me go ahead and just note here, this is extremely important.
[02:46:57.326 --> 02:47:07.650]  I'm about to go through news, and this is extremely, extremely important information that you are about to hear.
[02:47:07.650 --> 02:47:19.055]  Dollars should be replaced as international standard, UN report says, and if the guys give me a document cam shot, I will show you this article for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[02:47:19.055 --> 02:47:25.838]  The dollar is an unreliable international currency and should be replaced by a more stable system, the United Nations
[02:47:26.838 --> 02:47:30.841]  Department of Economic and Social Affairs said in a report released Tuesday.
[02:47:30.841 --> 02:47:42.669]  So this is a CIA, OSS, Pentagon created system in 1945 to dissolve other nations and bring them under the corporate governance.
[02:47:42.669 --> 02:47:51.475]  And here we are, 60 years later, 60 plus years later, and they're saying, dissolve our currency.
[02:47:51.475 --> 02:47:54.337]  Now remember, this is a creation of our traitorous government.
[02:47:56.701 --> 02:48:01.125]  The use of the dollar for international trade came under increasing scrutiny when the U.S.
[02:48:01.125 --> 02:48:02.647]  economy fell into recession.
[02:48:02.647 --> 02:48:10.775]  The dollar has proven not to be a stable store of value, which is a requisite for a stable reserve currency, the report said.
[02:48:10.775 --> 02:48:14.398]  Many countries, in Asia in particular, have been building up massive dollar reserves.
[02:48:14.398 --> 02:48:16.761]  As a result, those countries' currencies have become
[02:48:17.461 --> 02:48:20.922]  Undervalued, decreasing their ability to import goods from abroad.
[02:48:20.922 --> 02:48:32.105]  The World Economic and Social Survey 2010 is supporting a proposal long advocated by the International Monetary Fund to create a standardized international system for liquidity transfer.
[02:48:32.105 --> 02:48:34.206]  Now, what is the G20 calling for?
[02:48:34.206 --> 02:48:35.486]  What is Geithner calling for?
[02:48:35.486 --> 02:48:36.866]  What is Goldman Sachs calling for?
[02:48:36.866 --> 02:48:39.367]  What are the real corporate spies?
[02:48:39.367 --> 02:48:42.828]  They're not Ruskies, they're not Chai-coms, they're corporate spies!
[02:48:44.502 --> 02:48:48.005]  And it's almost like we're Native Americans and these corporate spies are smallpox.
[02:48:48.005 --> 02:48:49.807]  We have no immunity to them.
[02:48:49.807 --> 02:48:56.352]  All we're worried about is, you know, foreign enemies wearing turbans, and so we can't see it.
[02:48:56.352 --> 02:48:58.714]  Now, decades ago, the globalists said they would do this.
[02:48:58.714 --> 02:49:04.019]  They would first destroy and debase our currency, use the devaluation of it to fund their planetary regime.
[02:49:04.019 --> 02:49:10.225]  They would then implode the dollar and create a global reserve currency owned and run by private banking consortium.
[02:49:11.104 --> 02:49:19.450]  The elite banks, and now they've got the Financial Reform Act, which the Washington Post admits fully takes over our banks.
[02:49:19.450 --> 02:49:21.491]  That is real banks down the street from you.
[02:49:21.491 --> 02:49:29.657]  As the Texas Banking Association said two months ago, this is a global corporate banking takeover of real banks that is taking place right now.
[02:49:29.657 --> 02:49:31.719]  So it's a global consolidation.
[02:49:31.719 --> 02:49:34.741]  And as they called for it, the Copenhagen Treaty last year.
[02:49:34.741 --> 02:49:38.003]  For the environment, they wanted an SDR and global carbon tax.
[02:49:38.003 --> 02:49:40.265]  Now for the oil spill, they want the carbon tax.
[02:49:40.805 --> 02:49:45.549]  For every reason under the sun, they need this, they say.
[02:49:45.549 --> 02:49:52.875]  And they go on to say, under this proposal, countries would no longer have to buy up foreign currencies.
[02:49:52.875 --> 02:49:59.761]  They would simply have special drawing rights, or SDRs, from the IMF and World Bank.
[02:49:59.761 --> 02:50:01.703]  And it would be a basket of currencies.
[02:50:01.703 --> 02:50:05.986]  So what that means is, the yen, the yuan, the euro, the dollar, they will all be
[02:50:07.199 --> 02:50:12.301]  Pegged and set to whatever level that the private central banks tell them to be at.
[02:50:12.301 --> 02:50:14.121]  So they won't be a unified value.
[02:50:14.121 --> 02:50:17.922]  This will allow the mega banks to also currency speculate however they want.
[02:50:17.922 --> 02:50:19.623]  Insider trade however they want.
[02:50:19.623 --> 02:50:23.204]  Their main shareholder being Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.
[02:50:23.204 --> 02:50:25.425]  Globally that's the top two.
[02:50:25.425 --> 02:50:28.385]  And always behind every new evil.
[02:50:28.385 --> 02:50:33.007]  Whether it's oil spills or banker bailouts or selling people derivatives they know were going to implode.
[02:50:34.465 --> 02:50:37.808]  When we come back, I'm going to finish up with this key news.
[02:50:37.808 --> 02:50:39.769]  Because here they are now.
[02:50:39.769 --> 02:50:41.951]  Here they are, out in the open.
[02:50:41.951 --> 02:50:48.696]  Global governance, SDRs, the end of the dollar, the dollar's not good.
[02:50:48.696 --> 02:50:58.464]  The very banks that took over our country and did this to the dollar are now saying, oh, it's not reliable, we've got a new system so they can rape you even better.
[02:51:01.929 --> 02:51:04.411]  The food storage industry leader has done it again.
[02:51:04.411 --> 02:51:08.693]  Introducing FDG Clubs and Survival Bucks from the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[02:51:08.693 --> 02:51:16.658]  For over 39 years, the Freeze-Dry Guy has served various government agencies and the private sector with the finest in storable foods and emergency rations.

[02:51:49.017 --> 02:51:51.260]  That's freezedryguy.com or call 866-404-3663.
[02:51:51.260 --> 02:51:52.522]  The Freeze Dry Guy.
[02:51:52.522 --> 02:51:53.524]  The best you can buy.
[02:52:01.212 --> 02:52:03.594]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.594 --> 02:52:05.917]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.917 --> 02:52:09.140]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.140 --> 02:52:14.245]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.245 --> 02:52:18.429]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.749 --> 02:52:21.092]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.092 --> 02:52:23.635]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.635 --> 02:52:26.898]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.898 --> 02:52:34.487]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.827 --> 02:52:40.229]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.229 --> 02:52:43.069]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.069 --> 02:52:46.750]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.750 --> 02:52:47.831]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.831 --> 02:52:49.171]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:49.171 --> 02:52:50.672]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:05.794 --> 02:53:08.556]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?

[02:53:16.021 --> 02:53:18.002]  And not the cause of sinus problems.

[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:51.180]  It works!
[02:54:08.626 --> 02:54:13.727]  The Rockefellers, on record, created the League of Nations.
[02:54:13.727 --> 02:54:17.928]  They created the United Nations.
[02:54:17.928 --> 02:54:25.870]  They have always openly called for a world corporate government for the administrative convenience of international bankers.
[02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:29.191]  That's a quote by David Rockefeller.
[02:54:29.191 --> 02:54:34.692]  In his memoirs, New York Times, he's made similar statements.
[02:54:34.692 --> 02:54:38.093]  So, out in the open, they got our country in debt.
[02:54:39.144 --> 02:54:42.007]  They had a private Federal Reserve takeover.
[02:54:42.007 --> 02:54:50.257]  For every dollar you use or get paid at your job, debt is created for there to just be a dollar in the system.
[02:54:50.257 --> 02:54:51.439]  They have money machines.
[02:54:51.439 --> 02:54:53.101]  They're able to buy up the world.
[02:54:53.101 --> 02:54:54.523]  Now they've destroyed our system.
[02:54:55.503 --> 02:55:13.676]  Through that, they consolidate power, we eat the Ponzi scheme, we pay the tens of trillions of dollars, the Greeks lose their islands, the Greeks lose their roads, we lose our infrastructure, our ports, our taxes go up, and then now the bankers create a new bubble that is SDRs.
[02:55:16.050 --> 02:55:23.094]  Above the nation state and you will pay carbon taxes on everything you do to directly to private banks.
[02:55:23.094 --> 02:55:26.156]  They are now even above the nations that they're dissolving.
[02:55:26.156 --> 02:55:28.718]  Now that is high treason.
[02:55:28.718 --> 02:55:31.279]  That is who this country is threatened by.
[02:55:31.279 --> 02:55:35.742]  That's who sold us out to China and used China to deindustrialize this country.
[02:55:35.742 --> 02:55:40.445]  This is the group that has set up the SPP trying to get rid of our borders.
[02:55:40.445 --> 02:55:44.447]  The group that got rid of Europe's borders and got rid of their due process and their sovereignty.
[02:55:47.375 --> 02:55:49.977]  It's amazing.
[02:55:49.977 --> 02:55:55.321]  This is a private, corporate, hostile takeover of America.
[02:55:55.321 --> 02:56:02.266]  And then meanwhile, the news is leaving our borders wide open.
[02:56:02.266 --> 02:56:07.850]  But the top story is 11 Russian spies that were so deadly they could have brought down America.
[02:56:07.850 --> 02:56:09.531]  Of course Russia has spies.
[02:56:09.531 --> 02:56:10.832]  Of course they're spies.
[02:56:12.699 --> 02:56:16.141]  And it's important that they be exposed.
[02:56:16.141 --> 02:56:36.795]  But this is the top news story that Russia reportedly had 11 spies in this country when we have corporations that are foreign, that openly call for world government, that openly are establishing a world banking structure that we will pay taxes to, that have bought off our politicians and give them campaign contributions in plain view.
[02:56:36.795 --> 02:56:42.259]  Foreign corporate spies that own and run banks bigger than any one government
[02:56:43.476 --> 02:56:53.184]  Through fraud, they've gotten this power, and they are there making cash payments to the President and the members of Congress.
[02:56:53.184 --> 02:56:58.768]  And not telling Congress, when Congress asks over and over again, where are the trillions of dollars?
[02:56:58.768 --> 02:57:05.133]  The Congressman asked the head of the Fed, the head of the Treasury, the head of the New York Fed, and they say, I'm not going to tell you.
[02:57:05.133 --> 02:57:07.375]  And now under the reform
[02:57:09.144 --> 02:57:14.653]  They announced that, oh, this will fix the big bankers that did all of this and that set up the derivatives.
[02:57:14.653 --> 02:57:23.187]  The very Federal Reserve that represents these elite banks, it will now have unlimited power in financial regulation over anything that affects the economy.
[02:57:26.476 --> 02:57:28.357]  I mean, that's in the Washington Post.
[02:57:28.357 --> 02:57:28.977]  I read the bill.
[02:57:28.977 --> 02:57:29.858]  That's my analysis.
[02:57:29.858 --> 02:57:31.839]  That's Judge Andrew Napolitano's analysis.
[02:57:31.839 --> 02:57:33.480]  That's Ron Paul's analysis.
[02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:35.901]  But here's the Washington Post admitting it.
[02:57:35.901 --> 02:57:37.242]  Oh, we'll show the bankers.
[02:57:37.242 --> 02:57:39.643]  We'll give them a world government to punish them.
[02:57:39.643 --> 02:57:41.544]  And we'll pay taxes directly to them.
[02:57:41.544 --> 02:57:46.046]  And we'll give them power over all the other financial institutions so they can consolidate them.
[02:57:46.046 --> 02:57:47.407]  That will sure show them.
[02:57:47.407 --> 02:57:50.989]  And when they come into Toronto, the police will
[02:57:51.829 --> 02:58:01.512]  Ban free speech with no law, snatch and grab children off the streets and women, and threaten to rape women and rape women.
[02:58:01.512 --> 02:58:03.453]  Oh, I mean, this is actually happening.
[02:58:03.453 --> 02:58:05.673]  This is what's really going on.
[02:58:05.673 --> 02:58:08.054]  I'm going to come back in the next hour, continue to cover news.
[02:58:08.054 --> 02:58:15.657]  We've got Chuck Baldwin coming on in the last 30 minutes to talk about Ron Paul and how the feds are now trying to investigate Ron Paul and his organizations.
[02:58:15.657 --> 02:58:16.617]  I mean, this is a tyranny.
[02:58:18.052 --> 02:58:20.273]  They may try to lock Ron Paul in prison.
[02:58:20.273 --> 02:58:22.934]  They may grab me and slam my butt in prison.
[02:58:22.934 --> 02:58:26.976]  I mean, this is a hardcore takeover by these people.
[02:58:26.976 --> 02:58:28.617]  This isn't a game.
[02:58:28.617 --> 02:58:33.259]  We've done three hours of transmission, and I haven't plugged a book, a video, a sponsor, nothing.
[02:58:33.259 --> 02:58:39.922]  If you believe in what we're doing and want to defend the republic, you need to buy the books, buy the videos, buy the t-shirts at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:39.922 --> 02:58:41.003]  That supports our operation.
[02:58:43.223 --> 02:58:45.825]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.825 --> 02:58:51.448]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.448 --> 02:58:54.470]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.470 --> 02:58:59.793]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:59.793 --> 02:59:01.854]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:01.854 --> 02:59:06.857]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:06.857 --> 02:59:07.758]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.018 --> 02:59:09.139]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.139 --> 02:59:11.020]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.020 --> 02:59:12.101]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.101 --> 02:59:14.302]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.302 --> 02:59:15.643]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.643 --> 02:59:17.164]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.164 --> 02:59:22.448]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.448 --> 02:59:26.030]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.030 --> 02:59:29.493]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:29.833 --> 02:59:31.054]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.054 --> 02:59:31.974]  We don't know.
[02:59:31.974 --> 02:59:33.075]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.075 --> 02:59:33.996]  All you can get.
[02:59:33.996 --> 02:59:35.097]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.097 --> 02:59:38.139]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.139 --> 02:59:38.659]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.659 --> 02:59:40.340]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.340 --> 02:59:41.341]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.341 --> 02:59:42.562]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.562 --> 02:59:44.383]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:07.598 --> 03:00:09.961]  We are now into the fourth and final hour.
[03:00:09.961 --> 03:00:15.208]  Political prisoner Charlie Beach, arrested twice in the G20, will be joining us.
[03:00:15.208 --> 03:00:25.542]  There's now press reports of police threatening to rape women in the jail cells, reporters, and of women being raped by jail guards slash police.
[03:00:28.331 --> 03:00:37.138]  It's now openly being announced days after the G20 bankers met and extracted 1.2 billion out of the slaves for their security.
[03:00:37.138 --> 03:00:40.381]  And of course, there'll be interest paid to the bankers on that 1.2 billion as well.
[03:00:40.381 --> 03:00:46.105]  It's just so good for them because we buy every scam put before us.
[03:00:46.105 --> 03:00:48.287]  I'm just surprised they actually sent Madoff to prison.
[03:00:48.287 --> 03:00:50.689]  I mean, he's one of their top ringleaders.
[03:00:52.810 --> 03:00:57.853]  Just a bunch of Ken Lay Madoffs and I guess they're going to take everything over just because we're idiots.
[03:00:57.853 --> 03:00:58.913]  Here's another one.
[03:00:58.913 --> 03:01:01.635]  New York Times now admitting we're in a depression.
[03:01:01.635 --> 03:01:02.475]  The third depression.
[03:01:15.814 --> 03:01:17.516]  Here's one out of the London Telegraph.
[03:01:17.516 --> 03:01:23.482]  RBF tells clients prepare for monster money printing by the Federal Reserve before they get rid of the dollar.
[03:01:23.482 --> 03:01:28.306]  You'll still have it, kind of like they have, you know, currency in Zimbabwe or the peso in Mexico.
[03:01:29.372 --> 03:01:30.392]  I don't know.
[03:01:52.159 --> 03:01:53.261]  But, you know what?
[03:01:53.261 --> 03:01:55.566]  It feels too good to go down, doesn't it?
[03:01:55.566 --> 03:01:57.630]  There's kind of a deep-seated sickness in America.
[03:01:57.630 --> 03:02:02.640]  We killed 50 million babies, and the average subconscious mind is so powerful, it wants to die.
[03:02:03.953 --> 03:02:09.418]  The average American wants to fail and just wants to wallow into maggots and just implode.
[03:02:09.418 --> 03:02:17.344]  I mean, consciously people don't want that, but subconsciously there's a self-loathing, a self-hate, kind of like people want to fail.
[03:02:17.344 --> 03:02:21.348]  They don't have a stand-up-and-fight attitude anymore.
[03:02:21.348 --> 03:02:22.609]  A large portion of the public.
[03:02:23.226 --> 03:02:43.153]  Now, if any of you wanna save your families and save the society and not go into pure bondage, we have to ignore the 30, 40% that just love tyranny, and we have to ignore the other 30% or so that suck their thumbs, and the other 30% of us that know what's going on, we're just gonna have to stand up, be leaders, and take the society back.
[03:02:43.153 --> 03:02:49.876]  But RBS tells clients to prepare for monster money printing by the Federal Reserve.
[03:02:51.710 --> 03:02:53.473]  As recovery starts to stall in the U.S.
[03:02:53.473 --> 03:03:06.373]  and Europe, with echoes of the mid-1931, bond experts are once again dusting off a speech by Ben Bernanke giving eight years ago as a freshman governor of the Federal Reserve, where he talked about how they'd hyperinflate the dollar.
[03:03:09.144 --> 03:03:21.871]  Now, you noticed two years ago when they were getting ready for the banker bailout, banker takeover, I told you that by 2002, the stimulus would run out, that that was really a wealth transfer to the central banks, and that it would only make things worse.
[03:03:21.871 --> 03:03:23.632]  And now we're here.
[03:03:23.632 --> 03:03:27.534]  And that they were lying about the unemployment numbers and lying about inflation.
[03:03:27.534 --> 03:03:31.396]  And now that they've suckered you good, they're getting ready to sucker you again and say,
[03:03:33.646 --> 03:03:37.473]  We've got a reform package.
[03:03:37.473 --> 03:03:38.856]  Oh, but Senator Byrd died.
[03:03:38.856 --> 03:03:39.757]  He was the vote we needed.
[03:03:39.757 --> 03:03:40.739]  Oh, don't worry.
[03:03:40.739 --> 03:03:41.881]  And they're all over the news.
[03:03:41.881 --> 03:03:43.965]  Will the banks get punished for what they did?
[03:03:45.305 --> 03:03:51.529]  The American people demand they've got all these housewives and, you know, six-pack guys on the news.
[03:03:51.529 --> 03:03:54.531]  What do you think, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Jones?
[03:03:54.531 --> 03:03:56.392]  What do you think, Mr. Brown?
[03:03:56.392 --> 03:04:00.255]  Well, I tell you, I just want these banks to be brought to justice.
[03:04:00.255 --> 03:04:01.095]  It's not fair.
[03:04:01.095 --> 03:04:11.983]  And I'm glad Obama's in there about to bring these banks to justice with this new bank tax and that he's going to get the Federal Reserve in there, the federal government, Federal Reserve is not the federal government, but in there to
[03:04:12.563 --> 03:04:17.207]  To take action against these banks after what they did, and they cut back to Anderson Cooper.
[03:04:17.207 --> 03:04:21.611]  Yeah, it is good to see something being done.
[03:04:21.611 --> 03:04:23.693]  Anderson, admittedly CIA Cooper.
[03:04:23.693 --> 03:04:28.177]  I mean, but the good news is these globalists are running out of gas.
[03:04:28.177 --> 03:04:31.940]  Yeah, they're in control, but they're revealing themselves in the takeover.
[03:04:31.940 --> 03:04:34.383]  And they're losing all their viewers and all their credibility.
[03:04:34.383 --> 03:04:37.565]  I mean, that Washington Post article,
[03:04:38.413 --> 03:04:46.597]  Last Friday, that I've covered so much here, where it said, yeah, it's 600 trillion in derivatives, and yeah, the Federal Reserve's gonna be given total power over everything.
[03:04:46.597 --> 03:04:48.438]  That'll teach the banks.
[03:04:48.438 --> 03:04:57.322]  I mean, it's like saying, we're gonna let Hitler in 1935 just be planetary ruler, and that'll keep him under control.
[03:04:57.322 --> 03:04:59.983]  We're gonna fix the illegal alien problem by just legalizing them all.
[03:04:59.983 --> 03:05:00.804]  I mean, that's what they do.
[03:05:02.079 --> 03:05:08.523]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[03:05:08.523 --> 03:05:13.786]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[03:05:13.786 --> 03:05:27.335]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McIlvaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[03:05:28.095 --> 03:05:33.138]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[03:06:02.318 --> 03:06:06.281]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:06.281 --> 03:06:15.148]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:06:15.148 --> 03:06:19.772]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:06:19.772 --> 03:06:30.581]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:06:31.221 --> 03:06:40.724]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:40.724 --> 03:06:46.146]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[03:07:57.237 --> 03:07:58.978]  This information is too important to wait.
[03:08:01.380 --> 03:08:06.807]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.807 --> 03:08:09.070]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:17.739 --> 03:08:29.966]  The top story on the Drudge Report today is a political article where members of Congress, Republican members, are not allowed to go to the Gulf and look at the damage.
[03:08:29.966 --> 03:08:34.828]  And the Democrats are allowed to and are having paid trips.
[03:08:34.828 --> 03:08:39.391]  Oil spill visits get partisan and they are not allowed to go visit.
[03:08:39.391 --> 03:08:43.633]  So not only are the citizens not allowed to go visit, but everybody else is not allowed to visit.
[03:08:45.521 --> 03:08:51.446]  And you've got international waters out there, Taiwanese, Dutch, Norwegian, others.
[03:08:51.446 --> 03:08:56.430]  One Taiwanese ship can scoop up 500,000 barrels a day.
[03:08:56.430 --> 03:08:58.411]  That is an incredible number.
[03:08:58.411 --> 03:09:01.994]  That's the Associated Press reporting that, and Obama is still blocking it.
[03:09:01.994 --> 03:09:06.017]  But now, because the pressure's so high, they're saying, these hurricanes are gonna blow all this oil in.
[03:09:06.017 --> 03:09:06.638]  Why won't you?
[03:09:06.638 --> 03:09:10.321]  Why, for 70-plus days, have you been blocking countries from helping?
[03:09:10.321 --> 03:09:12.762]  You want this to be worse, so you can get your carbon tax.
[03:09:12.762 --> 03:09:14.364]  He's saying, okay, in the next month,
[03:09:14.804 --> 03:09:22.730]  I'm going to have lawyers look at it, and if these companies can jump through all these hoops that are impossible, then I'll let foreign governments do this.
[03:09:22.730 --> 03:09:26.092]  They've agreed to let 12 foreign governments or corporations help.
[03:09:26.092 --> 03:09:28.594]  But BP is in international waters.
[03:09:28.594 --> 03:09:36.620]  Why is BP in international waters than on our shores telling media and governors and congresspeople what they can do?
[03:09:36.620 --> 03:09:40.183]  Why is BP controlling the medical care people are supposedly getting?
[03:09:41.519 --> 03:09:45.120]  Why is BP telling their employees and contractors they can't wear masks?
[03:09:45.120 --> 03:09:50.722]  Just like the firefighters and police were told, you can't wear masks because the 9-11 dust is not bad for you.
[03:09:50.722 --> 03:09:54.183]  And if you do wear that, we'll have to admit it's bad.
[03:09:54.183 --> 03:09:56.764]  So just go ahead and breathe it and die later.
[03:09:56.764 --> 03:10:00.165]  And we're not going to fund you, by the way, you schmuck, you chump.
[03:10:01.158 --> 03:10:04.545]  I mean, these corporate people know we're gullible.
[03:10:04.545 --> 03:10:06.128]  They know we're sedate.
[03:10:06.128 --> 03:10:08.953]  They know we lay down and follow orders.
[03:10:08.953 --> 03:10:11.278]  And that's a recipe for enslavement.
[03:10:11.278 --> 03:10:12.861]  A recipe for ruination.
[03:10:13.874 --> 03:10:14.194]  So it's
[03:10:31.636 --> 03:10:31.996]  GOLF!
[03:10:45.414 --> 03:10:54.519]  Noah is reporting, the National Weather Association, and it's blowing huge swells in, and that oil is accelerating, because most of the oil is out to sea.
[03:10:54.519 --> 03:10:58.982]  It's now accelerating towards Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida.
[03:10:58.982 --> 03:11:05.226]  And then, if a hurricane comes in later, more from the east, towards Texas, it's going to blow it into Texas and Mexico.
[03:11:05.226 --> 03:11:14.171]  But right now, it's coming up towards the Texas-Mexico border, became a hurricane overnight, and is blowing it more towards where the currents are going.
[03:11:15.404 --> 03:11:20.267]  But it keeps leaking, it keeps leaking, it keeps leaking, and Obama just says it could be years.
[03:11:20.267 --> 03:11:26.890]  This is a new way of life, but if you'll let him pass a carbon tax, then he might let the ships in.
[03:11:26.890 --> 03:11:32.433]  Just like he told Senator Kyle, if you'll pass amnesty, then I might secure the border.
[03:11:32.433 --> 03:11:38.016]  But I've got to keep that border violent so I can lie to the public and tell them that amnesty will fix it.
[03:11:39.002 --> 03:11:40.704]  When there's still be narcotics being brought in.
[03:11:40.704 --> 03:11:43.648]  So, Hurricane Alex turns towards the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:11:43.648 --> 03:11:46.492]  Rick Perry declares state of emergency in Texas.
[03:11:46.492 --> 03:11:52.440]  So, I'm bracing here in Austin for the... I've looked at the science, especially the dispersant.
[03:11:53.559 --> 03:11:56.481]  And then the off-gassing chemicals that are released from oil.
[03:11:56.481 --> 03:12:07.630]  Yes, oil doesn't get picked up and mixed with water and go into the atmosphere, but the byproducts and the benzene and the heavy metals can get mixed with water.
[03:12:07.630 --> 03:12:09.071]  That's why you can have muddy rain.
[03:12:09.071 --> 03:12:11.974]  That's why you can have fish rain or toads rain.
[03:12:11.974 --> 03:12:19.399]  When a tornado, a water spout, a tornado in the ocean or a lake sucks them up,
[03:12:20.396 --> 03:12:30.986]  I've seen, I grew up in Dallas and I'd look out at Lake Ray Hubbard and you'd see tornadoes on, on, you know, tearing up houses and tearing, I only saw this a few times, it's incredibly beautiful, but also devastating.
[03:12:30.986 --> 03:12:36.111]  And you'd see them tearing up houses, tearing up trees, and the tornado would be brown, full of junk and dirt.
[03:12:36.111 --> 03:12:42.678]  Then it would hit Lake Ray Hubbard, I'd be watching this from our house on the hill, looking down, and it would hit and they'd turn into water spouts and turn blue.
[03:12:44.380 --> 03:12:50.823]  They would be brown and or black full of, you know, leaves and dirt and grass and parts of buildings.
[03:12:50.823 --> 03:12:52.684]  And then they just come across from raw lead.
[03:12:52.684 --> 03:12:58.586]  I was in Rockwall watching and those and those tornadoes would hit and they just turned blue.
[03:12:58.586 --> 03:13:02.008]  They turned blue as they sucked up the water.
[03:13:02.008 --> 03:13:07.290]  I'm not saying the houses being destroyed was beautiful, but the water spouts were beautiful.
[03:13:07.290 --> 03:13:08.051]  It's the same thing.
[03:13:09.238 --> 03:13:13.201]  And it's not just that waterspouts are all over the Gulf.
[03:13:13.201 --> 03:13:20.067]  I mean, I've been on a cruise in the Gulf and seen waterspouts, one after the other, and stood on the deck of the ship as they came over us.
[03:13:20.067 --> 03:13:21.608]  They weren't the tornadic type.
[03:13:21.608 --> 03:13:24.010]  They were the smaller waterspouts.
[03:13:24.010 --> 03:13:27.813]  But see, and now I'm digressing off into meteorology and earth changes.
[03:13:27.813 --> 03:13:36.680]  The issue here is that, yes, the byproducts and the toxic chemicals and the
[03:13:39.500 --> 03:13:40.841]  Dispersants they're using.
[03:13:40.841 --> 03:13:47.666]  In fact, Google the amount of dispersant used in the Gulf, because I keep getting my numbers crossed.
[03:13:47.666 --> 03:13:52.730]  It's like I said, that Taiwanese trawler did 50,000 barrels, but it was 500,000 barrels.
[03:13:52.730 --> 03:13:56.072]  The mine just can't get around this stuff.
[03:13:56.072 --> 03:13:58.794]  And I want to say they said 200,000 gallons.
[03:14:01.821 --> 03:14:05.682]  of this had been used, of the super deadly dispersant.
[03:14:05.682 --> 03:14:14.564]  They've got planes flying over Spring, and I looked up that dispersant and did some research, and it is true that that dispersant goes right up into the rain.
[03:14:14.564 --> 03:14:17.484]  So I'm looking forward, I guess, to all the dispersant.
[03:14:17.484 --> 03:14:22.065]  Louisiana, Mississippi is already enjoying dispersant raining down on them.
[03:14:22.065 --> 03:14:26.466]  And now the Washington Post, now the EPA is talking about gulf evacuations.
[03:14:26.466 --> 03:14:27.866]  They're not saying how big.
[03:14:27.866 --> 03:14:30.027]  So this is going from bad to worse.
[03:14:31.988 --> 03:14:33.369]  Hmm.
[03:14:33.369 --> 03:14:38.913]  Hurricane Alex churns towards Mexico, Texas coast.
[03:14:38.913 --> 03:14:42.175]  And they knew they could have gone in with those big ships and scooped up almost all the oil.
[03:14:42.175 --> 03:14:44.977]  Because they've really developed the science since then.
[03:14:44.977 --> 03:14:51.441]  But since they blocked it and used a spurs instead, it's going to be a bigger disaster and maybe cataclysmic.
[03:14:51.441 --> 03:14:54.123]  Or the response to it may be cataclysmic.
[03:14:54.123 --> 03:14:56.364]  The martial law they're gearing up for.
[03:14:56.364 --> 03:14:59.646]  Hurricane Alex turns towards Mexico, Texas coast.
[03:14:59.646 --> 03:15:01.328]  BP access to medical care.
[03:15:02.188 --> 03:15:07.237]  Uh, controls access to medical care for Gulf oil cleanup workers, denying that they're sick.
[03:15:07.237 --> 03:15:08.519]  That's what they always do.
[03:15:08.519 --> 03:15:10.101]  A bunch of them have died.
[03:15:10.101 --> 03:15:11.904]  Hundreds and hundreds are in the hospital.
[03:15:11.904 --> 03:15:14.989]  Medical doctors are saying their lungs are full of toxic chemicals.
[03:15:14.989 --> 03:15:16.532]  They're going into cardiac arrest.
[03:15:23.168 --> 03:15:35.012]  All right, from the Deepwater Horizons, it says that surface disbursement used, it's always worse than I say, 1.3 million gallons of that deadly chemical.
[03:15:35.012 --> 03:15:38.553]  1.3 million gallons.
[03:15:38.553 --> 03:15:39.874]  That's from the Associated Press.
[03:15:39.874 --> 03:15:44.495]  That's directly from the BP's own site.
[03:15:44.495 --> 03:15:49.597]  And another type that they're using, subsea, they're putting into the ocean, 576,000 gallons.
[03:15:54.534 --> 03:15:56.220]  Total dispersant used 1,606,000 gallons.
[03:15:56.220 --> 03:15:56.521]  Holy mackerel!
[03:16:03.288 --> 03:16:08.010]  I mean, let the crude oil come in and let the states clean it up.
[03:16:08.010 --> 03:16:10.491]  Let the ships come in and get it before it comes in.
[03:16:10.491 --> 03:16:17.734]  Don't spray 1.6 million gallons of stuff that'll literally eat the skin off your body.
[03:16:17.734 --> 03:16:20.696]  They're reporting that stuff is eating boats.
[03:16:20.696 --> 03:16:26.698]  It's so strong, that's in mainstream news, that it's eating the boats.
[03:16:26.698 --> 03:16:27.879]  You know what, I'm gonna be honest with you.
[03:16:27.879 --> 03:16:29.439]  I'm not having my kids breathe in this.
[03:16:29.439 --> 03:16:30.920]  And if this stuff blows into Austin,
[03:16:35.649 --> 03:16:38.471]  I'm gonna have to go to Montana or something.
[03:16:38.471 --> 03:16:41.714]  What happens if 20 million people are evacuated?
[03:16:41.714 --> 03:16:47.719]  I mean, they had less than 300,000 or so evacuated out of New Orleans, and Austin was a circus.
[03:16:47.719 --> 03:16:49.400]  Houston was a circus.
[03:16:49.400 --> 03:16:51.322]  Almost bankrupted the cities paying for it.
[03:16:51.322 --> 03:16:53.724]  What is gonna happen here?
[03:16:53.724 --> 03:16:57.167]  I can't believe that terrorist Obama has done this.
[03:16:57.167 --> 03:17:03.091]  And I've been calling him a terrorist for two weeks, on record calling for criminal indictments, blocking the states and counties and cities.
[03:17:05.140 --> 03:17:05.200]  And
[03:17:24.986 --> 03:17:28.288]  That's a cop-out saying the Feds say we can't put berms up.
[03:17:28.288 --> 03:17:37.314]  The Feds say, hey, you have a responsibility when treason is going on and the Feds have no jurisdiction on your state ground and in those estuaries.
[03:17:37.314 --> 03:17:40.536]  You go out there and you tell that Coast Guard, get out of your way.
[03:17:40.536 --> 03:17:47.101]  I mean, it's like anybody in a uniform is now God as long as that illegal alien, Barry Sitaro, tells him so.
[03:17:51.889 --> 03:17:52.109]  This is
[03:18:10.305 --> 03:18:22.437]  It's also for the elections, where it's going to be so insane, building up into November, that people won't remember government health care takeover, they won't remember the gun grabbing, they won't remember all the lies, all the torture.
[03:18:22.437 --> 03:18:25.600]  It'll just be complete bedlam if this continues.
[03:18:25.600 --> 03:18:30.444]  I mean, if they let... Let's search the latest total oil spill.
[03:18:30.444 --> 03:18:31.705]  Total oil in the Gulf.
[03:18:31.705 --> 03:18:34.028]  They keep lying about it, so it's always worse than what they say.
[03:18:36.277 --> 03:18:37.859]  Charlie Veitch is supposed to get out soon.
[03:18:37.859 --> 03:18:39.821]  He says he's going to give us the exclusive first report.
[03:18:39.821 --> 03:18:45.407]  We've also got Chuck Baldwin scheduled on the Ron Paul persecution that's now going on.
[03:18:45.407 --> 03:18:51.274]  I mean, look, everybody's always said when they go after Alex Jones, Ron Paul and others, look out.
[03:18:51.274 --> 03:18:53.917]  And look at how they're demonizing us in the media.
[03:18:53.917 --> 03:18:57.080]  Look at the hoax that they've been putting out.
[03:18:57.080 --> 03:18:57.601]  Hurricane.
[03:19:00.100 --> 03:19:01.561]  News continues.
[03:19:01.561 --> 03:19:02.862]  Look at this little jewel.
[03:19:02.862 --> 03:19:04.383]  Give me a document cam shot on that.
[03:19:04.383 --> 03:19:05.964]  Just in miscellaneous.
[03:19:05.964 --> 03:19:09.966]  How long have I told you if John McCain picks somebody, they're bad?
[03:19:09.966 --> 03:19:12.248]  I don't care if Sarah Palin poses with an AR-15.
[03:19:12.248 --> 03:19:15.130]  That doesn't cut it.
[03:19:15.130 --> 03:19:18.352]  You don't see Ron Paul posing with AR-15s, but he defends them.
[03:19:18.352 --> 03:19:19.933]  He's the real deal.
[03:19:19.933 --> 03:19:22.935]  You don't wave guns around, folks.
[03:19:22.935 --> 03:19:24.676]  You don't wave a gun around and fool me.
[03:19:25.888 --> 03:19:28.470]  Palin goes rogue against Tea Party candidates.
[03:19:28.470 --> 03:19:36.134]  Human Events, big conservative publication, admits that she's sabotaging Tea Party, true Tea Party Ron Paul people nationwide.
[03:19:36.134 --> 03:19:37.675]  Well, that's her job.
[03:19:37.675 --> 03:19:43.258]  And that's that woodchuck from Arkansas' job.
[03:19:43.258 --> 03:19:47.341]  He's as fake as a $3 bill, though he's a slick talker, one of the slickest I've heard.
[03:19:48.721 --> 03:19:51.844]  And, uh, same thing with Mitt Romney and all these guys.
[03:19:51.844 --> 03:19:57.810]  And they admit she's anti-Tea Party, anti-Patriot, mainline Republican.
[03:19:57.810 --> 03:19:59.691]  She'll give you Mitt Romney if she has her druthers.
[03:19:59.691 --> 03:20:01.593]  Mr. Socialist Healthcare himself.
[03:20:01.593 --> 03:20:03.975]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:20:03.975 --> 03:20:06.297]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:20:06.297 --> 03:20:09.500]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:20:09.500 --> 03:20:14.245]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:20:14.605 --> 03:20:19.110]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:21.472]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:20:21.472 --> 03:20:24.015]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:20:24.015 --> 03:20:27.258]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:20:27.258 --> 03:20:34.866]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:20:35.186 --> 03:20:40.589]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:20:40.589 --> 03:20:43.430]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:20:43.430 --> 03:20:47.112]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:20:47.112 --> 03:20:48.192]  And I got news for you.
[03:20:48.192 --> 03:20:49.533]  You're everyone else.
[03:20:49.533 --> 03:20:51.034]  Invisible Empire.

[03:21:00.791 --> 03:21:10.816]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:21:10.816 --> 03:21:17.259]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[03:21:17.259 --> 03:21:26.103]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:21:26.483 --> 03:21:35.674]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:21:35.674 --> 03:21:40.659]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[03:21:40.659 --> 03:21:42.081]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:42.081 --> 03:21:44.584]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[03:23:00.711 --> 03:23:03.732]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:23:03.732 --> 03:23:09.053]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:09.053 --> 03:23:11.113]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:11.113 --> 03:23:16.114]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:23:16.114 --> 03:23:17.294]  How much do you want?
[03:23:17.294 --> 03:23:18.414]  When do you want it?
[03:23:18.414 --> 03:23:20.295]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:23:20.295 --> 03:23:21.375]  When will you need it?
[03:23:21.375 --> 03:23:23.575]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:23:23.575 --> 03:23:24.916]  Will there be any food?
[03:23:24.916 --> 03:23:26.216]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:23:26.596 --> 03:23:28.977]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[03:23:28.977 --> 03:23:31.698]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:23:31.698 --> 03:23:35.300]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:23:35.300 --> 03:23:39.102]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:23:39.102 --> 03:23:40.342]  How much will you need?
[03:23:40.342 --> 03:23:41.243]  We don't know.
[03:23:41.243 --> 03:23:42.343]  How much do you want?
[03:23:42.343 --> 03:23:43.284]  All you can get.
[03:23:43.284 --> 03:23:44.044]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:23:44.364 --> 03:23:47.407]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:23:47.407 --> 03:23:49.648]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:23:49.648 --> 03:23:50.629]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:24:02.863 --> 03:24:19.676]  Bloomberg Markets Magazine senior writer Michael Smith discusses the use of Wachovia Corp., Bank of America Group, and other banks by Mexican drug cartels to launder its funds in the magazine's August 2010 issue.
[03:24:21.557 --> 03:24:32.027]  Smith reports that Wells Fargo, which bought Wachovia in 2008, admitted in court that its unit failed to monitor and report suspected money laundering by narcotics traffickers.
[03:24:32.027 --> 03:24:36.391]  Yeah, uh, you know, some poor guy sells an old car and gets $2,000.
[03:24:36.391 --> 03:24:37.512]  I saw this case in Austin.
[03:24:39.514 --> 03:24:54.244]  And the IRS comes and grabs their bank account because they reported, well, the bank shows you deposit about 800 bucks every two weeks as a construction worker, and suddenly there was $2,000 extra in there, so the fraud unit called the government.
[03:24:54.244 --> 03:24:57.706]  Again, they're rat snitches worse than East Germany.
[03:24:57.706 --> 03:25:09.174]  We just accept total surveillance, and then up front, everything we do is reported to the feds, and under this new regulation reform, the big crime banks don't just take over all the other banks and get unlimited money.
[03:25:10.354 --> 03:25:12.055]  Literally, unlimited whatever they want.
[03:25:12.055 --> 03:25:15.036]  Just ten times worse than the bailout of a year and a half ago.
[03:25:15.036 --> 03:25:15.756]  A hundred times.
[03:25:15.756 --> 03:25:16.836]  In fact, it's unlimited.
[03:25:16.836 --> 03:25:17.836]  It's infinity worse.
[03:25:17.836 --> 03:25:21.537]  It's just unlimited.
[03:25:21.537 --> 03:25:23.778]  There's no words to describe it.
[03:25:23.778 --> 03:25:26.999]  But then meanwhile, oh, billions of dollars, sorry.
[03:25:26.999 --> 03:25:30.740]  We didn't know it was Mexican drug cartels, jeepers, weepers.
[03:25:36.007 --> 03:25:37.088]  And it just goes on and on.
[03:25:37.088 --> 03:25:37.969]  No, no, no.
[03:25:37.969 --> 03:25:41.912]  The cops are going to kick down your door looking for one balloon of heroin.
[03:25:41.912 --> 03:25:46.877]  Meanwhile, the Pentagon admits they're growing almost all the opium in the world in Afghanistan.
[03:25:46.877 --> 03:25:52.382]  Over 90% is produced there and our government grows it, ships it out directly to your whore daughter's veins.
[03:25:52.382 --> 03:25:55.545]  Your daughter's a whore because they tricked her and sold it to her and got her addicted.
[03:25:55.545 --> 03:25:59.669]  Your son's dead because the government shipped heroin in and advertised it in movies like it was cool.
[03:26:01.035 --> 03:26:02.396]  They bring the drugs in.
[03:26:02.396 --> 03:26:07.778]  The big central banks are the equivalent of foreign spies destroying America.
[03:26:07.778 --> 03:26:10.219]  And I talked about this some in the first hour.
[03:26:10.219 --> 03:26:21.185]  You got these big global banks openly lobbying to get rid of the dollar and have a new UN run world government SDR where the banks make the profits and we pay taxes to them.
[03:26:21.185 --> 03:26:23.046]  That's CNN today.
[03:26:23.046 --> 03:26:23.586]  Today.
[03:26:26.986 --> 03:26:33.491]  CNN, dollar should replace as international standard, UN report says by SDRs, and it's the whole carbon tax plan.
[03:26:33.491 --> 03:26:34.672]  Now, is that treason?
[03:26:34.672 --> 03:26:35.733]  Is that espionage?
[03:26:35.733 --> 03:26:46.522]  Hitler couldn't conquer us, Stalin, Napoleon, whoever, couldn't conquer England, couldn't conquer America, but now we're conquered by these private bankers.
[03:26:48.063 --> 03:26:52.805]  Who have screwed everything up by design and gotten us deep in debt building their empire.
[03:26:52.805 --> 03:26:54.746]  And now they say, don't worry, we got a plan.
[03:26:54.746 --> 03:26:56.707]  We're going to take over even more.
[03:26:56.707 --> 03:27:01.729]  And meanwhile, look out, Iran wants to nuke you.
[03:27:01.729 --> 03:27:04.430]  Look out, there's Muslim terrorists everywhere.
[03:27:04.430 --> 03:27:06.131]  Meanwhile, the illegal aliens are pouring across.
[03:27:06.131 --> 03:27:07.712]  There's thousands dead.
[03:27:07.712 --> 03:27:11.154]  Obama says, you know, that he's going to leave the border open.
[03:27:11.154 --> 03:27:13.675]  So that people get terrorized and accepting amnesty.
[03:27:14.594 --> 03:27:20.661]  And meanwhile, the media is, oh my God, the beautiful redhead was a Russian spy, deep cover.
[03:27:20.661 --> 03:27:22.443]  Oh my gosh, they were surveilling us.
[03:27:22.443 --> 03:27:23.824]  They were actually spies.
[03:27:23.824 --> 03:27:26.907]  11 of them.
[03:27:26.907 --> 03:27:28.189]  What do you expect?
[03:27:28.189 --> 03:27:30.631]  The Chinese back under Clinton had over 3,000 front companies.
[03:27:32.353 --> 03:27:49.528]  Laurel Hughes, Missile Secrets, Communists, Chinese Generals in the White House, Commerce Secretary was going to go public, Ron Brown, they murdered him, Air Force Colonel who did the autopsy, said everybody on board had been shot in the head, they had special forces on board, shoot everybody, blow the door, hi-lo, he-lo, out of there.
[03:27:49.528 --> 03:27:51.210]  Classic tactic, but side issue.
[03:27:52.984 --> 03:27:55.084]  You've got spies running all over America.
[03:27:55.084 --> 03:28:01.926]  America is a giant joke, wide open to British, Israeli, Chinese, spies, and anybody else.
[03:28:01.926 --> 03:28:06.407]  Why is Russia the one group that when they have spies, the globalists go ape?
[03:28:06.407 --> 03:28:08.287]  Well, because the globalists made a deal.
[03:28:08.287 --> 03:28:09.867]  They put Lenin in.
[03:28:09.867 --> 03:28:11.028]  Stalin went sideways.
[03:28:11.028 --> 03:28:13.088]  They made deals later.
[03:28:13.088 --> 03:28:15.369]  But the Soviet Union was set up by U.S.
[03:28:15.369 --> 03:28:17.929]  and British intelligence, and that's now been declassified.
[03:28:17.929 --> 03:28:18.989]  Mao was put in.
[03:28:18.989 --> 03:28:20.370]  Mao continued the deal.
[03:28:20.370 --> 03:28:22.270]  The Chinese have never broken their deal with the bankers.
[03:28:23.148 --> 03:28:25.257]  When I say the US, I mean the bankers that hijacked us.
[03:28:26.098 --> 03:28:30.039]  Russia has broken those deals, and Russia's involved in all sorts of evil as well.
[03:28:30.039 --> 03:28:32.119]  Any big government is, that's the problem.
[03:28:32.119 --> 03:28:35.440]  But the point is, they're getting ready to attack Iran.
[03:28:35.440 --> 03:28:37.520]  They know Russia's been selling them weapons.
[03:28:37.520 --> 03:28:40.361]  They already started 888 with the Russians and tried to start World War III.
[03:28:40.361 --> 03:28:41.841]  That's now been declassified.
[03:28:41.841 --> 03:28:44.682]  That's been in major newspapers the last two months.
[03:28:44.682 --> 03:28:48.442]  And so they're just, this is a way to kick off, oh my gosh, the Russkies.
[03:28:48.442 --> 03:28:53.423]  And notice they've got Angelina Jolie, who's a CFR member, coming out with that new movie.
[03:28:53.423 --> 03:28:54.564]  I've seen it in movies.
[03:28:54.564 --> 03:28:55.424]  What's it called, Salt?
[03:28:56.443 --> 03:29:02.946]  And she's supposedly a government agent, but they have a Russian defector and he goes, I know who the spy is, it's you.
[03:29:02.946 --> 03:29:07.167]  And then she pulls off her wig and she's the sexy Russian.
[03:29:07.167 --> 03:29:13.290]  Just like they had all these sneak attack movies where America sneak attacked on TV and in the theaters right before 9-11.
[03:29:13.290 --> 03:29:18.392]  I mean, look, they made that movie to kick off the new Cold War.
[03:29:20.131 --> 03:29:20.651]  That's it.
[03:29:20.651 --> 03:29:22.111]  I mean, period.
[03:29:22.111 --> 03:29:25.592]  And you know, I made the point of prosecute these spies.
[03:29:25.592 --> 03:29:27.233]  And obviously they're spies.
[03:29:27.233 --> 03:29:29.553]  Husband and wife teams with fake names.
[03:29:29.553 --> 03:29:32.174]  Yeah, they're spies.
[03:29:32.174 --> 03:29:36.495]  Folks, the Iranians have guaranteed got sleeper cells here in the U.S.
[03:29:36.495 --> 03:29:40.156]  that the globalists won't have to stage terror attacks when they attack them.
[03:29:40.156 --> 03:29:41.176]  Iran will strike back.
[03:29:42.614 --> 03:29:44.515]  And then, that's what the globalists want.
[03:29:44.515 --> 03:29:47.477]  Just like they blew the oil well, they're blocking the recovery.
[03:29:47.477 --> 03:29:51.700]  They want the Iranians to attack, so they can take your rights!
[03:29:51.700 --> 03:29:53.101]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.101 --> 03:29:55.623]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.623 --> 03:29:58.325]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.970 --> 03:30:05.532]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:30:05.532 --> 03:30:06.433]  Number 1.
[03:30:06.433 --> 03:30:09.855]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:30:09.855 --> 03:30:10.715]  Number 2.
[03:30:10.715 --> 03:30:15.618]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:30:15.618 --> 03:30:16.358]  It's true.
[03:30:16.358 --> 03:30:21.221]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:30:21.221 --> 03:30:22.061]  Number 3.
[03:30:22.061 --> 03:30:25.643]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:30:25.643 --> 03:30:29.345]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:30:29.545 --> 03:30:30.346]  Number 4.
[03:30:30.346 --> 03:30:33.109]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:30:33.109 --> 03:30:36.793]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:30:36.793 --> 03:30:37.574]  Number 5.
[03:30:37.574 --> 03:30:41.719]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:30:41.719 --> 03:30:46.484]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:30:46.764 --> 03:30:50.947]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:50.947 --> 03:30:52.729]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[03:30:57.813 --> 03:31:04.959]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:31:04.959 --> 03:31:11.364]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:31:11.364 --> 03:31:15.267]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[03:31:15.447 --> 03:31:18.728]  How much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry and dishes.
[03:31:18.728 --> 03:31:23.610]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.

[03:31:32.273 --> 03:31:35.994]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter and see what he has to say.
[03:31:36.534 --> 03:31:43.296]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:31:43.296 --> 03:31:47.178]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[03:31:47.178 --> 03:31:48.358]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091.
[03:31:48.358 --> 03:31:55.260]  Visit our website, 5starsoap.com for buying a one to two month soap sampler.
[03:31:55.260 --> 03:31:56.221]  Thank you.
[03:31:56.221 --> 03:31:58.782]  You may be arrested and or subject
[03:32:04.682 --> 03:32:05.943]  Tyranny is here.
[03:32:05.943 --> 03:32:09.884]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:32:09.884 --> 03:32:12.105]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:32:12.105 --> 03:32:17.988]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:32:17.988 --> 03:32:24.231]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:32:24.651 --> 03:32:30.596]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:32:30.596 --> 03:32:34.799]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:32:34.799 --> 03:32:39.082]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:32:39.082 --> 03:32:45.046]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:32:45.046 --> 03:32:48.609]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:32:48.609 --> 03:32:50.570]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:32:50.570 --> 03:32:51.011]  It's here.
[03:32:51.651 --> 03:33:04.323]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:33:04.323 --> 03:33:10.969]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:10.969 --> 03:33:13.952]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:16.715 --> 03:33:20.738]  We've only got about 27 minutes left in worldwide broadcast.
[03:33:20.738 --> 03:33:26.482]  I may have to go into overdrive, which will be internet, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv streams only.
[03:33:26.482 --> 03:33:31.625]  Ib Charlie Veach is scheduled to get out of the Toronto prison.
[03:33:31.625 --> 03:33:34.127]  He was arrested a second time.
[03:33:34.127 --> 03:33:36.989]  Big international scandal, huge news across Canada.
[03:33:36.989 --> 03:33:46.315]  They charged him with a crime that didn't exist, and the police chief lied and said there was a crime of videotaping and being within five meters of a security fence.
[03:33:47.035 --> 03:33:47.656]  We're good to go.
[03:34:08.795 --> 03:34:10.897]  They have been extremely transparent.
[03:34:10.897 --> 03:34:16.121]  It is a political pact like CPAC or APAC or any of the other pacts.
[03:34:16.121 --> 03:34:17.723]  And the Republicans can have pacts.
[03:34:17.723 --> 03:34:19.124]  Israel can have pacts.
[03:34:19.124 --> 03:34:21.466]  The British can have pacts.
[03:34:21.466 --> 03:34:23.107]  BP can have a pact.
[03:34:23.107 --> 03:34:25.069]  Political Action Committee.
[03:34:25.069 --> 03:34:25.910]  Anybody can have it.
[03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:27.791]  General Electric can have one.
[03:34:27.791 --> 03:34:29.333]  But you can't have one.
[03:34:30.333 --> 03:34:34.375]  You, a true American, you who wants the Bill of Rights and Constitution restored.
[03:34:34.375 --> 03:34:35.736]  This is an unprecedented attack.
[03:34:35.736 --> 03:34:37.796]  We're going to cover that here in just a moment.
[03:34:37.796 --> 03:34:45.240]  We got Ron Paul already scheduled tomorrow, so this will be perfect timing with him on with us in the last 30 minutes as Chuck Baldwin
[03:34:46.741 --> 03:34:58.366]  Of course, the Constitution Party candidate for president in 2008 just did a fabulous job demonized by the Mike report as a terrorist as Ron Paul was and Bob Barr.
[03:34:58.366 --> 03:34:59.507]  But before we go to him.
[03:35:01.331 --> 03:35:10.278]  Not only is buying the books and videos something that's going to wake people up, that you can give others to truly inform them, but it's also how we fund our operation here.
[03:35:10.278 --> 03:35:23.348]  And I can think of no more important books than things like The Secret Team by Fletcher Prouty, The CIA and its Allies that Control the United States and the World by Fletcher Prouty, Head of Pentagon Black Ops, How They Fund the Communists, How They Run the Whole Show.
[03:35:24.429 --> 03:35:28.672]  Uh, Genetic Roulette, detailing how GMO food is meant to sterilize you.
[03:35:28.672 --> 03:35:34.316]  Uh, it reduces fertility of all, sterilizes some, so that everybody doesn't notice it right at once.
[03:35:34.316 --> 03:35:38.959]  It takes years to do it, and it covers a lot more than just that from all the government's own admissions.
[03:35:38.959 --> 03:35:42.721]  This book is vital for anyone out there.
[03:35:42.721 --> 03:35:48.225]  Uh, you got a doctor friend or a doctor in the family who's denying this, or a nutritionist, just give them this book.
[03:35:48.225 --> 03:35:49.986]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[03:35:49.986 --> 03:35:53.889]  The Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic, the two preeminent films
[03:35:54.850 --> 03:35:57.752]  Obama Deception is about to rival Loose Change for more views online.
[03:35:57.752 --> 03:35:59.493]  It's just devastating.
[03:35:59.493 --> 03:36:01.835]  Well over 60 million views online for free.
[03:36:01.835 --> 03:36:06.259]  But I'm challenging you to buy it in the high quality on DVD and make copies and get it out to everybody.
[03:36:06.259 --> 03:36:08.400]  Part 2 of that, Fall of the Republic.
[03:36:08.400 --> 03:36:10.342]  Invisible Empire and New Order Defined.
[03:36:10.342 --> 03:36:14.125]  We've got discounts where you can get these films as low as $5.95 a piece.
[03:36:14.125 --> 03:36:15.846]  Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:36:16.847 --> 03:36:19.470]  Uh, with, uh, so many great people.
[03:36:19.470 --> 03:36:21.552]  Richard Mack, Michael Bagnerik, R.J.
[03:36:21.552 --> 03:36:24.975]  Harris, uh, Cynthia Davis, so many others.
[03:36:24.975 --> 03:36:26.577]  That's how to take the states back.
[03:36:26.577 --> 03:36:32.463]  And when this book sells out, I'm gonna still carry it when I order it again, but not with a special.
[03:36:32.463 --> 03:36:34.985]  1995 hardcover, Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies.
[03:36:34.985 --> 03:36:38.409]  Get a free film of your choice at Infowars.com when you order it.
[03:36:40.649 --> 03:36:45.731]  And again, this is how you also fund the radio show, the news websites, everything we do.
[03:36:45.731 --> 03:36:48.513]  You can watch all my films and a lot more at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:36:48.513 --> 03:36:52.494]  And I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV members that make it possible.
[03:36:52.494 --> 03:36:55.416]  You can also call toll-free to get the films, the books, the materials.
[03:36:55.416 --> 03:37:00.198]  Be sure to ask about the specials and free videos and combos we have when you call 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[03:37:09.122 --> 03:37:13.072]  All right, without further ado, I want to put back up on screen for people.
[03:37:14.758 --> 03:37:19.920]  We've all got to stand together or hang separate, as the founding fathers said over and over again.
[03:37:19.920 --> 03:37:32.204]  And this is a very strongly worded letter from Ron Paul, who normally, even if he's talking about an incredibly dangerous situation, like war with Iran, chooses his words very carefully.
[03:37:32.204 --> 03:37:38.626]  But he says this is meritless, but could seriously disrupt their growing program to take America back.
[03:37:39.725 --> 03:37:40.146]  I don't know.
[03:37:58.849 --> 03:38:10.377]  Ladies and gentlemen, the big central banks can engage in robberies publicly, they can launder drug money, the marines can publicly be ordered to grow the opium in Afghanistan, which they don't like doing.
[03:38:10.377 --> 03:38:11.718]  Evil is right out in the open now.
[03:38:12.762 --> 03:38:17.323]  But Obama can try to appoint a lady who's anti-gun, anti-free speech.
[03:38:17.323 --> 03:38:21.784]  He can have all of his major czars calling for shutting down freedom on the internet.
[03:38:21.784 --> 03:38:28.465]  She can write thesis about socialist revolutions and how beautiful they are and how she can make them succeed.
[03:38:28.465 --> 03:38:32.066]  I mean, these people, everything they're doing is treason and criminal.
[03:38:32.066 --> 03:38:33.666]  I mean, and I don't just use that term.
[03:38:33.666 --> 03:38:34.767]  There is no other word.
[03:38:34.767 --> 03:38:38.648]  This is a group of violent revolutionaries like Lenin and Trotsky.
[03:38:38.648 --> 03:38:40.248]  We are in as great a danger now
[03:38:41.560 --> 03:38:44.481]  As the people of Russia were in 1916.
[03:38:44.481 --> 03:38:46.122]  Or the people of Germany in 1933.
[03:38:46.122 --> 03:38:48.483]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[03:38:48.483 --> 03:38:51.345]  They already want to arrest Ron Paul, myself, Chuck Baldwin.
[03:38:51.345 --> 03:38:53.185]  They're brainwashing cops about us.
[03:38:53.185 --> 03:38:54.386]  And I want to go to Chuck Baldwin now.
[03:38:54.386 --> 03:38:56.387]  I appreciate him holding while I went over this.
[03:38:56.387 --> 03:38:57.908]  This is unprecedented, Chuck.
[03:38:57.908 --> 03:38:58.708]  What's your take on it?
[03:38:59.451 --> 03:39:10.076]  Well, I just became aware of it today, as a matter of fact, and the letter I'm talking about from, I think it really was written by John Tate, who heads up Ron's campaign for liberty.
[03:39:10.076 --> 03:39:12.817]  And you're right, this is unprecedented.
[03:39:12.817 --> 03:39:23.241]  I can't imagine that they would have, you know, used this kind of action against any of the groups that you just mentioned in your monologue there.
[03:39:23.241 --> 03:39:26.603]  It's obviously a politically motivated
[03:39:28.388 --> 03:39:34.317]  Scandalous kind of activity that's being performed by the Obama administration here.
[03:39:39.904 --> 03:39:44.987]  Well, I mean, we can't just sit here and let these crooks try to persecute Ron Paul.
[03:39:44.987 --> 03:39:58.716]  I mean, we as citizens are allowed to form a political movement within the Republican Party to try to elect members of Congress and mayors and senators and governors that will just support the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:39:58.716 --> 03:40:04.961]  But these revolutionary terrorists, they know we're trying to save America and trying to stop their revolution.
[03:40:04.961 --> 03:40:06.041]  And so they're coming for us.
[03:40:07.402 --> 03:40:22.294]  The thing that they're going after, and this is what I think the listeners need to understand, what they're going after is shining the light on the voting records and the records of others, the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., and that's what the Campaign for Liberty does.
[03:40:22.294 --> 03:40:34.404]  They're excellent about informing the American people as to who supports what or who opposes what, whatever the case may be, keeping people informed as to what the representatives and senators are doing.
[03:40:34.984 --> 03:40:40.006]  I think that's what has really energized the ire of the Obama administration.
[03:40:40.006 --> 03:40:40.666]  You've got to remember that.
[03:40:40.666 --> 03:40:41.086]  Well, you're right.
[03:40:41.086 --> 03:40:43.867]  They have auto calls that are better than anybody's.
[03:40:43.867 --> 03:40:45.187]  They've got auto emails.
[03:40:45.187 --> 03:40:47.048]  They've got people that call you.
[03:40:47.048 --> 03:40:49.769]  And they're really helping defeat a lot of legislation.
[03:40:50.249 --> 03:40:52.191]  That's anti-American and globalist.
[03:40:52.191 --> 03:40:53.192]  You're right.
[03:40:53.192 --> 03:40:54.594]  And they can also look at the graph.
[03:40:54.594 --> 03:41:01.041]  They just see the Patriot movement with the Ron Paul being one of the centerpieces of the jewel in the crown energizing.
[03:41:01.041 --> 03:41:03.444]  They can see our growth curve.
[03:41:03.444 --> 03:41:04.785]  And that's what Cass Sunstein says.
[03:41:04.785 --> 03:41:06.607]  He says we've got to shut the web down.
[03:41:06.607 --> 03:41:10.812]  We've got to shut down these conspiracy theorists, these people that don't believe in global warming.
[03:41:11.072 --> 03:41:12.875]  These people that believe in a new world order.
[03:41:12.875 --> 03:41:15.018]  These people that believe in a global government.
[03:41:15.018 --> 03:41:18.463]  I mean, that's in CNN today, a global government with SDRs.
[03:41:18.463 --> 03:41:21.948]  They can't allow us to have any speech because we've got the truth!
[03:41:23.812 --> 03:41:25.493]  Well, that's exactly right.
[03:41:25.493 --> 03:41:33.219]  And I think, Alex, what you have said there, I think, is exactly the thinking that's behind it.
[03:41:33.219 --> 03:41:46.229]  Also, take into account the Disclose Act that just passed the House of Representatives, which, unfortunately, the NRA even refused to oppose because they got an exemption.
[03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:50.232]  So you get an exemption if you are somebody like NRA and a few other select
[03:41:50.772 --> 03:41:51.193]  I don't know.
[03:42:06.955 --> 03:42:08.916]  Now let's think about that.
[03:42:08.916 --> 03:42:12.198]  They're saying that American citizens and organizations
[03:42:23.953 --> 03:42:26.735]  You cannot tell the public a voting record.
[03:42:26.735 --> 03:42:30.898]  Think of how Twilight Zone, all of this is getting.
[03:42:30.898 --> 03:42:39.644]  I mean, they know what they're doing is unpopular and illegal and unconstitutional and treacherous and treasonous, literally.
[03:42:39.644 --> 03:42:46.349]  And they are, and I saw the Wall Street Journal headline, NRA sells out America.
[03:42:46.349 --> 03:42:50.772]  And even the Wall Street Journal admitted, I mean, this legislation is right out of Soviet Russia.
[03:42:51.556 --> 03:42:57.581]  Right, and you know, the Lord said that men love darkness rather than light when their deeds are evil.
[03:42:57.581 --> 03:42:58.701]  And that's what we've got going on.
[03:42:58.701 --> 03:43:03.465]  We've got a bunch of evil that's going on, and they don't want the light of day.
[03:43:03.465 --> 03:43:05.767]  The internet puts the light of day on it.
[03:43:05.767 --> 03:43:08.068]  You know, talk radio puts the light of day on it.
[03:43:08.068 --> 03:43:11.371]  Ron Paul's campaign for liberty puts the light of day on it.
[03:43:11.371 --> 03:43:13.092]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:43:13.092 --> 03:43:19.237]  They're trying to cover the light so that they can continue to operate in darkness.
[03:43:22.113 --> 03:43:24.635]  Do you ever scratch yourself, pinch yourself?
[03:43:24.635 --> 03:43:25.736]  I know I do all the time.
[03:43:25.736 --> 03:43:31.001]  I mean, it's one thing to intellectually years ago know that the globalists were planning this because we had their own documents.
[03:43:31.001 --> 03:43:32.302]  They've been public about it.
[03:43:32.302 --> 03:43:48.416]  But to see them actually doing it, government hijacking of health care and actually cutting the care to people, trying to launch new wars, trying to pass laws to secretly arrest citizens for no reason, openly saying they're going to take over the Internet, coming out with serious
[03:43:49.476 --> 03:43:51.178]  I mean, these guys, they really are criminals!
[03:44:04.708 --> 03:44:13.757]  Well, and not only that, I think that they feel that the momentum has been in their favor over the last several years, and it has, quite frankly.
[03:44:13.757 --> 03:44:16.059]  And I think they're trying to seize the moment.
[03:44:16.059 --> 03:44:18.461]  I think they're a little nervous about the Tea Party movement.
[03:44:18.461 --> 03:44:23.105]  I think they're a little nervous about the state sovereignty movement that's going on around the country.
[03:44:23.105 --> 03:44:28.090]  They're nervous about some of these state legislators and some of these candidates that are openly promoting
[03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:31.613]  I think that's what we see going on here.
[03:44:31.613 --> 03:44:39.902]  And I think we're in a fight, and we just have to make up our minds that we're not going to roll over and play dead, and we're not going to let these people steal our country.
[03:44:50.464 --> 03:45:02.371]  I mean, Kagan admits she's a socialist, and then Chris Matthews praises in his book and publicly Saul Alinsky and Lenin, but then if you say the government's socialist, he says you're a racist.
[03:45:02.371 --> 03:45:05.212]  I mean, these people know exactly what they're doing.
[03:45:05.212 --> 03:45:18.420]  I want to look at the audience who's watching on PrisonPlanet.tv and listening via AM FM shortwave satellite XM, later on YouTube, at PrisonPlanet.tv later, however you're watching, I want to look at you and I want to say something.
[03:45:19.653 --> 03:45:24.276]  They've got national TV specials coming out demonizing Chuck Baldwin, Ron Paul, and myself.
[03:45:24.276 --> 03:45:30.479]  They've got Pentagon and other government reports, state police, federal dossiers.
[03:45:30.479 --> 03:45:34.161]  The Canadian police have them on us saying we're the enemy.
[03:45:34.161 --> 03:45:40.064]  Just little old Pastor Chuck Baldwin, little old talk show host Alex Jones, little old Dr. Ron Paul.
[03:45:40.064 --> 03:45:40.885]  Why are they scared?
[03:45:40.885 --> 03:45:42.186]  They're scared because we know
[03:45:43.186 --> 03:45:44.787]  Who they are.
[03:45:44.787 --> 03:45:46.668]  We can see who they are.
[03:45:46.668 --> 03:45:51.150]  And they can see us exponentially reaching new people and the public waking up.
[03:45:51.150 --> 03:45:54.452]  And as the darkness falls, they want to confiscate our candles.
[03:45:54.452 --> 03:45:57.774]  Because our little lights are getting brighter and brighter.
[03:45:57.774 --> 03:46:00.995]  Not because we're getting brighter, but because the darkness is falling.
[03:46:00.995 --> 03:46:02.436]  They want to shut the web down.
[03:46:02.436 --> 03:46:04.897]  They want to stop free speech.
[03:46:04.897 --> 03:46:06.158]  The curtain's falling now.
[03:46:06.718 --> 03:46:17.964]  You have got to use the internet and videos and books and materials and donate and spread the word like your life depends on it and like the country's life depends on it now.
[03:46:17.964 --> 03:46:25.168]  We do not have time because the information you have and that we have and all of us have together is so powerful.
[03:46:25.768 --> 03:46:32.274]  That they, before were humorous filled and just trying to demonize us and ignore us, now they just want to shut us off.
[03:46:32.274 --> 03:46:34.556]  And it's because they're hemorrhaging to death.
[03:46:34.556 --> 03:46:43.324]  They have gambled to go for it all, and we can grab victory, you know, out of the jaws of defeat, or victory from the jaws of defeat, now.
[03:46:43.324 --> 03:46:50.490]  But please, appreciate these shows, appreciate the websites, appreciate the info now, because
[03:46:52.063 --> 03:46:55.406]  Chuck, can you make it any simpler than I am or boil it down?
[03:46:55.406 --> 03:46:57.188]  I think you're doing a pretty good job, Alex.
[03:46:57.188 --> 03:46:59.230]  You're exactly right.
[03:46:59.230 --> 03:47:04.235]  The American people have got to decide what they want for their children and for their future.
[03:47:04.235 --> 03:47:06.998]  If they are just willing to have the shackles put around their necks,
[03:47:07.658 --> 03:47:14.340]  And glibly go on into slavery and tyranny, let their children be raised in a tyrannical state.
[03:47:14.340 --> 03:47:15.180]  Well, then so be it.
[03:47:15.180 --> 03:47:15.920]  Make your choice.
[03:47:15.920 --> 03:47:24.443]  But for people that love freedom and love liberty and really do want their children to grow up in a land of freedom, it's going to be up to us right now to fight for it, as you said.
[03:47:24.443 --> 03:47:28.444]  And I think that we've got to spend our money according to our convictions.
[03:47:28.444 --> 03:47:33.645]  We've got to support those individuals and those institutions that are out on the front lines.
[03:47:33.645 --> 03:47:35.126]  We can't do it by ourselves.
[03:47:35.766 --> 03:47:37.507]  None of us are able to do it by ourselves.
[03:47:37.507 --> 03:47:39.548]  None of us are independently wealthy.
[03:47:39.548 --> 03:47:43.671]  All of us are scratching for survival when it comes to paying the bills.
[03:47:43.671 --> 03:47:53.636]  And if people out there are going to have an impact on their country, they've got to dig down and they've got to support those institutions and those people that are on the front lines fighting for their freedom.
[03:47:53.636 --> 03:47:57.738]  And if we're not willing to do that, Alex, quite frankly, then it's
[03:47:59.731 --> 03:48:00.652]  It's gone.
[03:48:00.652 --> 03:48:07.675]  I mean, we're to the point now where this thing is getting close to the curtain coming down.
[03:48:07.675 --> 03:48:13.617]  And I know you know that, and I know a lot of your listeners know that, but I've just got to say that.
[03:48:13.617 --> 03:48:14.878]  We are getting close.
[03:48:14.878 --> 03:48:22.841]  I mean, this thing is escalating exponentially in a way that I, quite frankly, am a little surprised at.
[03:48:22.841 --> 03:48:24.362]  I mean, I knew it was going to grow.
[03:48:24.362 --> 03:48:26.023]  I knew it was going to escalate.
[03:48:26.683 --> 03:48:28.844]  I had no idea it was going to be this fast.
[03:48:28.844 --> 03:48:33.205]  And let's face it, this is not just Barack Obama.
[03:48:33.205 --> 03:48:36.486]  We had the same thing going on with Bush, we had the same thing going on with Clinton.
[03:48:36.486 --> 03:48:38.427]  But now it's at rocket power.
[03:48:38.427 --> 03:48:41.628]  I mean, I agree with you though.
[03:48:41.628 --> 03:48:43.508]  I'm amazed at how fast it's moving.
[03:48:43.508 --> 03:48:45.029]  And you've got Sarah Palin now out.
[03:48:45.949 --> 03:48:55.713]  In human events, targeting real Tea Party candidates, you've got targeting Ron Paul-type candidates, even though she endorsed Rand, she's showing her colors there.
[03:48:55.713 --> 03:49:02.596]  The whole system is getting more and more desperate, but now is the time to throw it all on the line, folks.
[03:49:02.596 --> 03:49:04.876]  Now is the time to come to the aid of your country.
[03:49:04.876 --> 03:49:13.940]  America's never been perfect, but it's a Christian nation, it's been the best in the world, the wealthiest because of the blessings of liberty that God gave us because we did do the right thing.
[03:49:14.540 --> 03:49:19.968]  And that engine of freedom is dying, and the choice is being made now.
[03:49:19.968 --> 03:49:24.355]  You better be at your city councils, your county commissioners, your water districts talking about this.
[03:49:24.355 --> 03:49:25.857]  You better be at the statehouse.
[03:49:25.857 --> 03:49:27.880]  You better be calling to talk radio.
[03:49:27.880 --> 03:49:29.041]  You had better not wait...
[03:49:30.884 --> 03:49:44.999]  You better get out there now and point at this tyranny for what it is and point out this is illegal and wrong and we had better point out that it is both parties like Chuck Baldwin said but under Obama
[03:49:45.760 --> 03:49:47.502]  Chuck, hasn't it gone into overdrive?
[03:49:47.502 --> 03:49:48.242]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:49:48.242 --> 03:49:50.384]  It's gone into overdrive, no doubt about it.
[03:49:50.384 --> 03:49:52.726]  But that's because the foundation was already laid.
[03:49:52.726 --> 03:49:55.949]  I mean, I predicted this back in the Bush years.
[03:49:55.949 --> 03:50:03.736]  I said that, you know, if Obama's elected, he is just going to expedite everything that's already been laid and put in place.
[03:50:03.736 --> 03:50:07.018]  I mean, Bush just laid the table for him.
[03:50:07.018 --> 03:50:09.340]  And of course, Clinton did before that.
[03:50:09.340 --> 03:50:13.244]  And now that he's got the Congress, he being Obama, he's got the Congress.
[03:50:13.744 --> 03:50:21.869]  They're able to implement these things that they were put in place back during the Bush years, but it's just exploding.
[03:50:21.869 --> 03:50:26.892]  You know, you've got the oil thing, which is such a distraction to other things that are going on.
[03:50:26.892 --> 03:50:28.693]  I mean, this is not a serious thing down here.
[03:50:28.693 --> 03:50:29.934]  I live on the Gulf Coast.
[03:50:29.934 --> 03:50:31.995]  We're dealing with what's going on down here.
[03:50:32.635 --> 03:50:33.435]  Stay there.
[03:50:33.435 --> 03:50:38.297]  Come back and tell us about the spirit of resistance and the issues the oil spill is overshadowing.
[03:50:38.297 --> 03:50:39.277]  Chuck Vollman is our guest.
[03:50:39.277 --> 03:50:39.637]  Stay with us.
[03:51:03.882 --> 03:51:06.044]  Subject to public police action.
[03:51:06.044 --> 03:51:07.305]  Tyranny is here.
[03:51:07.305 --> 03:51:10.968]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:51:10.968 --> 03:51:13.470]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:51:13.470 --> 03:51:18.655]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:51:19.335 --> 03:51:25.999]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:51:25.999 --> 03:51:31.963]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:51:31.963 --> 03:51:35.685]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:51:36.165 --> 03:51:36.866]  Don't answer it!
[03:52:03.470 --> 03:52:11.578]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[03:53:02.554 --> 03:53:03.795]  This is not a drill.
[03:53:03.795 --> 03:53:06.296]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:53:06.296 --> 03:53:08.197]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[03:53:08.197 --> 03:53:15.421]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[03:53:15.421 --> 03:53:19.803]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.

[03:53:50.636 --> 03:53:52.497]  Before they come for your guns.
[03:53:52.497 --> 03:53:53.117]  Hideyourguns.com.
[03:53:53.117 --> 03:53:53.677]  Right now.
[03:54:17.601 --> 03:54:20.884]  Coming to you from deep behind enemy lines in occupied USA.
[03:54:20.884 --> 03:54:22.465]  We want America back.
[03:54:22.465 --> 03:54:24.047]  We're the good guys.
[03:54:24.047 --> 03:54:25.348]  Loveless are the bad guys.
[03:54:25.348 --> 03:54:26.769]  Choose sides.
[03:54:26.769 --> 03:54:29.952]  Chuck Bolden, we got a headline up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:54:29.952 --> 03:54:32.795]  Obama wants the oil spill crisis to get worse.
[03:54:32.795 --> 03:54:35.377]  He's been under massive pressure to let the oil skimmers in.
[03:54:35.377 --> 03:54:37.078]  Now he says he might in the next month.
[03:54:37.879 --> 03:54:40.362]  Because the hurricanes are already there to blow in more oil.
[03:54:40.362 --> 03:54:43.866]  Give us your brief take on that, given the whole history of it.
[03:54:43.866 --> 03:54:45.889]  I was talking to her in the break, you think they're sabotage.
[03:54:46.823 --> 03:54:56.307]  I think Obama and the administration knew about the problems that the BP well had as early as January and February of this year.
[03:54:56.307 --> 03:55:02.529]  I think they deliberately did nothing in order to exacerbate the problem.
[03:55:02.529 --> 03:55:07.591]  I personally believe, at least the list is put this way, I suspect sabotage.
[03:55:07.591 --> 03:55:12.973]  I suspect that Halliburton and the Bush-Clinton crime cabal
[03:55:13.973 --> 03:55:14.894]  I don't know.
[03:55:14.894 --> 03:55:15.274]  I don't know.
[03:55:37.204 --> 03:55:42.870]  Yeah, for those that don't know, it's on record with CIA officer Terry Reid and others that Bush and Clinton actually worked together.
[03:55:42.870 --> 03:55:44.372]  That's all a staged event.
[03:55:44.372 --> 03:55:48.536]  Shifting gears, what else in your view is the oil spill distracting from?
[03:55:48.536 --> 03:55:51.159]  I think it's from the healthcare takeover that's happening.
[03:55:52.116 --> 03:56:18.417]  Well, obviously they want to use it to pass the cap and trade energy monstrosity, but I think what it's overlooking is, Alex, there's probably $6 trillion, and I know we throw these numbers around and nobody can calculate that high, but we're talking about $6 trillion that's hanging around out there that the British government, or I should say the British bankers, believe has been stolen from them.
[03:56:19.237 --> 03:56:40.604]  And whenever this well went up and all the pressure now that's placed upon BP and probably going to go bankrupt, and what that's going to do throughout Britain and Europe, I believe this was a signal by the people that stole that money to say, leave us alone.
[03:56:40.604 --> 03:56:48.067]  There are things here going on, Alex, that I believe that are so criminal, that are so evil, that are so sinister.
[03:56:48.647 --> 03:56:49.828]  Well, I mean, take the Federal Reserve.
[03:57:03.917 --> 03:57:11.721]  Reorganization that even the Washington Post admits gives them unlimited power over all financial institutions and things that affect the economy.
[03:57:11.721 --> 03:57:15.904]  In Andrew Napolitano's words, this is a total seizure of the economy.
[03:57:15.904 --> 03:57:19.946]  So the Federal Reserve engineers the banking collapse, now they get even more power.
[03:57:20.586 --> 03:57:21.988]  I mean, it's all happening right now.
[03:57:21.988 --> 03:57:26.132]  Bird dying has sabotaged that, at least for the next few weeks.
[03:57:26.132 --> 03:57:28.074]  That's actually a gift from God.
[03:57:28.074 --> 03:57:30.877]  I'm not glad he's dead, but that screwed up the passage of it.
[03:57:30.877 --> 03:57:32.979]  But, I mean, this is amazing.
[03:57:32.979 --> 03:57:34.321]  It's all happening at once.
[03:57:36.057 --> 03:57:40.423]  It is, and it's all happening, I think, in a coordinated effort.
[03:57:40.423 --> 03:57:43.286]  I do not believe that these things are isolated instances.
[03:57:43.286 --> 03:57:44.488]  I just don't believe that.
[03:57:44.488 --> 03:57:51.196]  These things are too big, they are too coincidental, and the ramifications are too monstrous to suggest
[03:57:51.776 --> 03:57:57.403]  That this is not something but a design behind it.
[03:57:57.403 --> 03:57:59.586]  And I think that's exactly what's going on.
[03:57:59.586 --> 03:58:04.491]  And I think it's all related to some of what I'm talking about here today, some of the things that you're talking about.
[03:58:04.491 --> 03:58:09.217]  Obviously, they're not going to ever let a crisis go without using it.
[03:58:09.217 --> 03:58:09.858]  Absolutely.
[03:58:09.858 --> 03:58:10.999]  Chuck Baldwin, author.
[03:58:13.266 --> 03:58:17.870]  The presidential candidate and so much more.
[03:58:17.870 --> 03:58:19.131]  Give us your website.
[03:58:19.131 --> 03:58:20.532]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[03:58:20.532 --> 03:58:26.337]  It's ChuckBaldwinLive.com ChuckBaldwinLive.com ChuckBaldwinLive.com.
[03:58:26.337 --> 03:58:27.899]  Ours are InfoWars.com.
[03:58:27.899 --> 03:58:29.580]  ChuckBaldwinLive.com.
[03:58:29.580 --> 03:58:32.082]  I break down everything that happened in retransmission.
[03:58:32.082 --> 03:58:33.323]  Chuck Baldwin will talk to you again soon.
[03:58:33.323 --> 03:58:35.245]  We've got Ron Paul on tomorrow.
[03:58:35.245 --> 03:58:36.226]  Pray for Ron Paul.
[03:58:36.226 --> 03:58:37.347]  Pray for all of us.
[03:58:37.347 --> 03:58:39.309]  The enemy is coming out to persecute us.
[03:58:39.309 --> 03:58:40.830]  That story's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
