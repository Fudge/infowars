[00:00.000 --> 00:18.400]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:43.000]  The scenes you're witnessing in Afghanistan are about to prelude to what is coming to
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.660]  civilization near you.
[00:45.660 --> 00:51.800]  It's Monday, August 16th, the year is 2021.
[00:51.800 --> 00:58.200]  And as usual, Infowars will exclusively reveal to the world exactly what's happening and
[00:58.200 --> 01:07.400]  why it's happening and the fact that the collapse of Afghanistan is a deliberate globalist plan.
[01:07.400 --> 01:13.360]  We have all the evidence, we have all the admissions, and we also have history.
[01:13.360 --> 01:22.160]  What did retreating empires always do when they pulled out of an area?
[01:22.160 --> 01:24.240]  They would burn everything to the ground.
[01:24.240 --> 01:28.640]  It's called scorched earth.
[01:28.640 --> 01:34.640]  And after 20 years of so-called nation building, the decision has been made across the planet
[01:34.640 --> 01:39.920]  with the great reset to destabilize the world.
[01:39.920 --> 01:44.520]  And that's why the exact same forces during the Arab Spring promoted by CNN and Google
[01:44.520 --> 01:51.880]  and the rest of the criminals, promoted the Muslim Brotherhood, the Wahhabist majority
[01:51.880 --> 01:59.160]  sect of Islam to launch offensive operations all over Africa, the Middle East, Europe,
[01:59.160 --> 02:05.200]  and Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, you name it, they launched them everywhere, from
[02:05.200 --> 02:17.560]  the Philippines to New York City, from the capital of California to the capital of Afghanistan.
[02:17.560 --> 02:23.680]  This group has been protected by the Saudi Arabians and others forever.
[02:23.680 --> 02:27.440]  It was set up by British intelligence over 100 years ago.
[02:27.440 --> 02:31.920]  Go back to Lawrence of Arabia, that's a true story, not just a Hollywood movie.
[02:31.920 --> 02:38.440]  And so just like there was the airlift of Evel after 9-11, where over 100,000 Afghan troops
[02:38.440 --> 02:45.560]  were airlifted out of Kabul and the other main cities of Afghanistan by the U.S. military
[02:45.560 --> 02:53.160]  and their orders, they've basically now been allowed back in with the spectacle of the
[02:53.160 --> 03:00.840]  collapsing civilization so that in the very near future, U.S. forces will be forced to
[03:00.840 --> 03:10.320]  go back in yet again, and you will see the ongoing 2.2 trillion that has already been
[03:10.320 --> 03:22.800]  transferred to the globalist military industrial complex, look, tame in comparison, the decision
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.120]  has been made to have a post-industrial world.
[03:27.120 --> 03:31.760]  But the globalists, while they implode something, always transfer the wealth of technology to
[03:31.760 --> 03:32.760]  themselves.
[03:32.760 --> 03:37.800]  This is also being done in the sick minds of the globalists that have blamed Trump and
[03:37.800 --> 03:41.480]  wanted to pull out without a totally different plan of how to do that.
[03:41.480 --> 03:46.680]  And of course, now communist China that controls the puppet Biden and much of the globalist
[03:46.680 --> 03:53.080]  system is moving in to take over, but not with force, but with economic deals.
[03:53.080 --> 03:56.680]  The United States is designed to be bankrupted.
[03:56.680 --> 04:04.000]  The same CIA that orchestrated this collapse is the same CIA that funds transgenderism and
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.080]  men in women's bathrooms and drag queen story time and anti-fuck, no borders, no wall, no
[04:10.080 --> 04:11.080]  USA at all.
[04:11.080 --> 04:15.440]  That's why everybody watches Jimmy Fallon, and they say, yay, white people aren't the
[04:15.440 --> 04:20.320]  majority anymore, and they flash the applause and the white people clap.
[04:20.320 --> 04:22.640]  That's CIA.
[04:22.640 --> 04:23.840]  That's race-based politics.
[04:23.840 --> 04:26.160]  That's to Biden conquer.
[04:26.160 --> 04:31.240]  So everyone's saying Biden's an idiot, Biden is a moron, Biden should design.
[04:31.240 --> 04:32.240]  Biden is an idiot.
[04:32.240 --> 04:33.240]  Biden is a moron.
[04:33.240 --> 04:34.240]  Biden was not elected president.
[04:34.240 --> 04:37.280]  He should resign, but he's not running anything.
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.080]  This has all been done by design, just like he did at the campaign.
[04:41.080 --> 04:46.960]  He just sits there at Camp David down at the swimming pool and plays Mario Kart while the
[04:46.960 --> 04:49.800]  globalist discredit and bankrupt America.
[04:49.800 --> 04:53.800]  This is all designed to destroy confidence in America while bankrupting us while they
[04:53.800 --> 04:58.080]  then turn the security forces inward against the American people declaring us terrorists.
[04:58.080 --> 05:03.640]  You say you want to fight tyranny.
[05:03.640 --> 05:06.440]  You say you want to fund the Second American Revolution.
[05:06.440 --> 05:07.440]  I know you do.
[05:07.440 --> 05:08.440]  That's why you're here.
[05:08.440 --> 05:12.720]  So I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening right now to understand that there
[05:12.720 --> 05:17.000]  are really two places in the media that don't back down and that tell the truth, that have

[05:58.160 --> 06:26.240]  to the globalists, so thank you so much for your support.
[06:28.160 --> 06:41.440]  The planned collapse of civilization has now been initiated, the globalists are consolidating
[06:41.440 --> 06:49.560]  control while they destroy the borders of what's left of the western world.
[06:49.560 --> 06:57.240]  The collapse of Afghanistan will now send its estimated 5 million Afghan refugees into
[06:57.240 --> 07:05.840]  Europe, and the traitorous Pentagon leadership has already sent out an order to prepare for
[07:05.840 --> 07:17.800]  hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees to be brought to Texas.
[07:17.800 --> 07:21.200]  All of this is completely and absolutely engineered.
[07:21.200 --> 07:25.560]  Biden was chosen because he was senile, he was chosen because he was doddering, he was
[07:25.560 --> 07:30.200]  chosen because he was corrupt, he was chosen because his son was a crackhead, he was chosen
[07:30.200 --> 07:33.800]  because he's a double agent of the communist Chinese.
[07:33.800 --> 07:38.840]  So they have full control worldwide, the globalist, to rub our noses in it and to let the world
[07:38.840 --> 07:46.760]  know America's gone, and the power of the globalist is all there is now.
[07:46.760 --> 07:52.000]  This is the post industrial world, this is the plan, when you see all the major foundations
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.760]  and all the major universities and the CIA, TV commercials and the chairman of the Joint
[07:57.760 --> 08:05.760]  Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense say white people are bad.
[08:05.760 --> 08:09.840]  And people that question lockdowns are terrorist and people that question elections are terrorist
[08:09.840 --> 08:12.920]  and we're going to get you.
[08:12.920 --> 08:18.200]  That is what you do to turn the people against the military and the police.
[08:18.200 --> 08:24.640]  Now, of course, morons like Austin and Millie were put there because they're unpatriotic,
[08:24.640 --> 08:28.400]  self aggrandizing cowards and don't even know what they're doing.
[08:28.400 --> 08:33.880]  They actually believe this is some utopian communist takeover they're heading up.
[08:33.880 --> 08:40.440]  When really it's designed to destroy the country forever and rip us into pieces, so we collapse.
[08:40.440 --> 08:45.480]  This is sabotage, it's the entire global government project and America must go down
[08:45.480 --> 08:56.960]  and fall before the world will then be forced to embrace the technocracy of the new world
[08:56.960 --> 08:59.240]  order global government.
[08:59.240 --> 09:02.600]  Remember Millie just a couple of months ago, he goes, I want to know about white rage,
[09:02.600 --> 09:08.440]  I want to know why white people, because they hate black people, that's the talking points.
[09:08.440 --> 09:14.200]  I want to know why they attacked that capital.
[09:14.200 --> 09:17.520]  Jimmy Fallon came out and said, hey, white people aren't the majority anymore.
[09:17.520 --> 09:24.080]  And they flashed the applause on everybody, mainly white people actually taught that being
[09:24.080 --> 09:25.080]  white is bad.
[09:25.080 --> 09:26.080]  Wow.
[09:26.080 --> 09:27.680]  You thought that was just at the universities?
[09:27.680 --> 09:30.200]  Who runs the universities?
[09:30.200 --> 09:32.960]  Who enforces what the big foundations want?
[09:32.960 --> 09:36.360]  Who set up the CIA, the big foundations?
[09:36.360 --> 09:39.320]  Who heads up the CIA?
[09:39.320 --> 09:43.680]  The former head of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace and boy, they'll be peace when you're
[09:43.680 --> 09:45.120]  all dead.
[09:45.120 --> 09:52.240]  The CIA is a vestigial British empire system designed to destabilize and enslave everyone
[09:52.240 --> 09:57.720]  and annihilate culture and civilization.
[09:57.720 --> 10:01.880]  The reverse of what the British empire was until the globalist got control of it about
[10:01.880 --> 10:07.120]  150 years ago.
[10:07.120 --> 10:09.120]  And this is the plan and I'm very frustrated.
[10:09.120 --> 10:11.000]  We put the live show headline up for folks.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.040]  I'm very frustrated that again, I'm talking to all these very smart military people.
[10:16.040 --> 10:17.720]  I'm talking to all these other folks.
[10:17.720 --> 10:26.000]  I'm reading all the opinions and all the ideas out there and almost no one gets almost
[10:26.000 --> 10:39.440]  no one understands that this is a tried and true plan that is being carried out.
[10:39.440 --> 10:41.760]  So there's your headline.
[10:41.760 --> 10:46.960]  Info wars has exclusively learned that Joe Biden is purposely collapsing Afghanistan.
[10:46.960 --> 10:50.880]  Tune in to learn why.
[10:50.880 --> 10:57.280]  All this is part of the larger great reset globally stabilization operation.
[10:57.280 --> 11:02.240]  The most censored man in the world delivers critical intel.
[11:02.240 --> 11:07.000]  Globalists do not want you to hear or share.
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.040]  And again, I'm not up here saying, oh, I'm so smart.
[11:11.040 --> 11:12.520]  You better listen to me.
[11:12.520 --> 11:15.000]  We've proven we know the enemy battle plan.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.560]  It's all right there in front of you.
[11:16.560 --> 11:18.920]  It's historical and it's happening now.
[11:18.920 --> 11:24.120]  Burn down the cities, call it mostly peaceful, defund the police, murder rate triples nationwide,
[11:24.120 --> 11:26.120]  call it mostly peaceful.
[11:26.120 --> 11:31.320]  Have our military be forced to take deadly shots so the good people are kicked out and
[11:31.320 --> 11:38.040]  then put generals in that say white people are inherently bad to further discredit the
[11:38.040 --> 11:40.360]  US military.
[11:40.360 --> 11:45.440]  All of this is done scientifically.
[11:45.440 --> 11:51.800]  They tell you one thing one day, another thing the next day to make you lose faith because
[11:51.800 --> 11:54.120]  you're going to believe it's the US government.
[11:54.120 --> 11:56.760]  That's not the US government.
[11:56.760 --> 11:59.400]  That's not the descendant of George Washington.
[11:59.400 --> 12:04.800]  That is a political minion of the New World Order and of David Rockefeller and Klaus Schwab
[12:04.800 --> 12:05.960]  and Bill Gates.
[12:05.960 --> 12:11.440]  That is an literal enemy to demoralize you.
[12:11.440 --> 12:12.960]  It's not America that did this.
[12:12.960 --> 12:13.960]  It's them.
[12:13.960 --> 12:17.120]  If you want to blame America, it's the fact that we let them do it.
[12:17.120 --> 12:18.520]  But they're the conscious ones of it.
[12:18.520 --> 12:21.240]  So here's Biden back in July.
[12:21.240 --> 12:26.440]  And then he made similar comments just last week that there's not going to be any Hanoi
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.880]  moment, there's not going to be any helicopters on the roofs, there's not going to be any
[12:31.880 --> 12:33.120]  scenes of hysteria.
[12:33.120 --> 12:35.400]  And I'm telling you, I'm somewhat a scholar of history.
[12:35.400 --> 12:36.560]  It's so interesting.
[12:36.560 --> 12:43.560]  I've studied, read a few books and watched a lot of documentaries about the fall of
[12:43.560 --> 12:47.200]  Saigon seeing Hanoi having a Freudian slip.
[12:47.200 --> 12:50.360]  I wish it was the fall of Hanoi.
[12:50.360 --> 12:55.880]  And we see all this unfolding.
[12:55.880 --> 13:06.400]  So here is Biden saying, we're not going to have a Vietnam moment like we saw in 1975
[13:06.400 --> 13:07.400]  in 2021.
[13:07.400 --> 13:13.080]  And he said it a month ago and he said it a week ago, knowing full damn well that when
[13:13.080 --> 13:16.680]  they did what they're doing now, that indeed this would happen.
[13:16.680 --> 13:22.720]  And when the Taliban loaded the highways up, just like Saddam did in 1991 and got all their
[13:22.720 --> 13:26.680]  armored vehicles they captured that have been given to them, just like Obama gave them all
[13:26.680 --> 13:33.760]  weapons in the Arab Spring, that they could all be killed on those highways and their
[13:33.760 --> 13:36.840]  entire Taliban force wiped out.
[13:36.840 --> 13:38.440]  But they knew it wasn't a setup.
[13:38.440 --> 13:43.000]  So they drove in from all over the country in big, long, five, 10 mile long convoys that
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  could have all been easily destroyed.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.360]  But no, that didn't happen because they had to be given the victory.
[13:50.360 --> 13:53.800]  When we come back, I'm going to play you that clip of Biden that they're trying to disappear
[13:53.800 --> 13:58.400]  everywhere that's so important where he says no way they're going to take the country over.
[13:58.400 --> 14:03.760]  But just remember, there's thousands of data points that I know 100% this was done on purpose.
[14:03.760 --> 14:06.000]  But let me just explain this.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.640]  Remember the Arab Spring?
[14:09.640 --> 14:15.920]  Turns out 10 years ago when I covered Bilderberg Group north of London at a bizarre transhumanist
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.880]  hotel where they were meeting and all these sculptures of skeletons merging with machines
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.240]  that they planned at that event how to launch the Arab Spring a year later and how to fund
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.920]  al-Qaeda to take over Syria, Libya and other areas over through our allies in Egypt, blew
[14:30.920 --> 14:33.160]  up hundreds of churches.
[14:33.160 --> 14:41.280]  That was done by big tech and the globalist and the criminal cabal that's basically like
[14:41.280 --> 14:43.120]  specter from a James Bond movie.
[14:43.120 --> 14:44.120]  That's what it is.
[14:44.120 --> 14:48.640]  He and Fleming created the secret corporate groups manipulating countries against each
[14:48.640 --> 14:51.800]  other for chaos, power and control and destabilization.
[14:51.800 --> 14:53.880]  That's because that's really who this group is.
[14:53.880 --> 15:02.120]  It's literally Klaus Schwab with the cat in his lap, his grandfather from the top Nazis.
[15:02.120 --> 15:06.320]  That's art imitating life, not life imitating art.
[15:06.320 --> 15:10.160]  And so they funded the Arab Spring that killed millions of people and destabilized all of
[15:10.160 --> 15:16.200]  Africa once North Africa fell and destabilized the Middle East.
[15:16.200 --> 15:22.680]  And now what's happening again, ladies and gentlemen, the same thing.
[15:22.680 --> 15:28.280]  They took $2 trillion out of the taxpayer money.
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.200]  They built up the infrastructure which they're now handing over to the communist Chinese,
[15:32.200 --> 15:38.040]  the bridges, the highways, the roads, the communications, the weapons and they left
[15:38.040 --> 15:44.320]  it all there on purpose for the Taliban so they can now organize new land routes into
[15:44.320 --> 15:48.360]  Russia and into Eastern Europe and the globalist invasion can accelerate.
[15:48.360 --> 15:52.120]  That's why they did the Arab Spring to begin with was to take out the borders of Western
[15:52.120 --> 15:53.120]  and Southern Europe.
[15:53.120 --> 15:55.200]  Now they're taking out the rest of the borders.
[15:55.200 --> 15:59.400]  They're using the Afghans as a weapon system like they've done since the 70s.
[15:59.400 --> 16:03.240]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[16:03.240 --> 16:07.920]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:07.920 --> 16:08.920]  Here's why.
[16:08.920 --> 16:12.880]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:12.880 --> 16:17.880]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:17.880 --> 16:23.040]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and
[16:23.040 --> 16:26.960]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:26.960 --> 16:30.880]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues or just getting off the
[16:30.880 --> 16:35.640]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:35.640 --> 16:40.920]  And better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[16:40.920 --> 16:41.920]  too.

[16:58.200 --> 16:59.720]  Hey everybody.
[16:59.720 --> 17:04.600]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great
[17:04.600 --> 17:05.600]  news.
[17:05.600 --> 17:07.760]  I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:07.760 --> 17:08.760]  Here's the thing.
[17:08.760 --> 17:14.280]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[17:14.280 --> 17:19.560]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:19.560 --> 17:22.360]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:22.360 --> 17:23.520]  The best part?

[17:57.440 --> 18:04.480]  So what's the most important part, let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[18:04.480 --> 18:09.040]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but
[18:09.040 --> 18:12.880]  the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegor.
[18:12.880 --> 18:17.640]  Turboforce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[18:17.640 --> 18:22.040]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[18:22.040 --> 18:23.800]  system metabolism of a human.
[18:23.800 --> 18:26.680]  Some people get 15 hours out of this, some people get about 8 hours, but people take
[18:26.680 --> 18:29.720]  this, people are taking it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever
[18:29.720 --> 18:35.800]  had, because it's not high, nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their

[19:58.800 --> 20:03.640]  pouches for your cell phone.
[20:03.640 --> 20:33.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.480 --> 21:01.200]  Kind of excited to listen to this music.
[21:01.200 --> 21:14.400]  Welcome back my friends, I'm Alex Jones, your host and we are witnessing the destruction
[21:14.400 --> 21:23.440]  of civilization in real time and every time you watch them collapse society by design
[21:23.440 --> 21:28.440]  or release a virus by design or give you poison vaccines by design you ask why would they
[21:28.440 --> 21:29.440]  do that?
[21:29.440 --> 21:33.840]  Well you have to go read why they do that, they say they're depopulating you, they say
[21:33.840 --> 21:37.760]  it's survival of the fittest, they say they are acting as the predator like the bingal
[21:37.760 --> 21:44.240]  tiger and you are the little deer that is stupid and doesn't protect itself so you
[21:44.240 --> 21:46.720]  deserve to die.
[21:46.720 --> 21:52.360]  And so we see the shocking images of particularly young people, looks like teenagers, probably
[21:52.360 --> 21:58.520]  sex slaves trying to escape, you know Afghanistan, they estimate roughly 90% of the men have
[21:58.520 --> 22:04.560]  sex with boys, maybe have sex with an adult, man that's punishable by death, they shoot
[22:04.560 --> 22:06.440]  you or stone you or hang you.
[22:06.440 --> 22:11.720]  But if you have it with a child it's good and so that's, I'm seriously, so it's a
[22:11.720 --> 22:17.280]  bunch of, it's like 12, 13 year olds hanging on to the engines of the plane not knowing
[22:17.280 --> 22:24.360]  that when the galaxy transport takes off and it's going 300, 400 miles an hour, 500 miles
[22:24.360 --> 22:30.000]  an hour they're going to fall off and then there's the images of them falling off and
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.440]  smacking them, the concrete and falling through houses, we're not going to show you any of
[22:33.440 --> 22:37.280]  the actual video and photos of them hitting the ground but we will show you the video
[22:37.280 --> 22:43.040]  of them falling out of the side of the airplane to their deaths.
[22:43.040 --> 22:47.800]  And of course we have the Taliban al-Qaeda leader declaring their wondrous victory,
[22:47.800 --> 22:54.340]  there'll be lots of boys to rape tonight in Kabul and in Kandahar but right now let's
[22:54.340 --> 23:01.280]  go ahead and go to that Saigon moment, 1975, here is, there's actually five or six of these
[23:01.280 --> 23:07.000]  clubs from July and early August but here's just a smattering of some of the clubs from
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.600]  July 8th at the press conference with the aviator wearing puppet in chief telling you
[23:12.600 --> 23:15.080]  that everything's going to be absolutely wonderful in Afghanistan.
[23:15.080 --> 23:21.840]  Is the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable?
[23:21.840 --> 23:31.560]  No, it is not, because you have the Afghan troops that 300,000 well equipped as well
[23:31.560 --> 23:40.480]  as equipped as any army in the world and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban,
[23:40.480 --> 23:41.480]  it is not inevitable.
[23:41.480 --> 23:49.760]  Mr. President, some Vietnamese veterans see echoes of their experience in this withdrawn
[23:49.760 --> 23:54.080]  in Afghanistan, do you see any parallels between this withdrawal and what happened
[23:54.080 --> 23:55.720]  in Vietnam with some people feeling?
[23:55.720 --> 24:01.120]  None whatsoever, zero, what you had is yet an entire brigade breaking through the gates
[24:01.120 --> 24:04.840]  of our embassy, six if I'm not mistaken.
[24:04.840 --> 24:11.920]  The Taliban is not the North Vietnamese army, they're not remotely comparable in terms
[24:11.920 --> 24:12.920]  of capability.
[24:12.920 --> 24:17.160]  There's going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof
[24:17.160 --> 24:24.160]  of a embassy in the of the United States from Afghanistan, it is not at all comfortable.
[24:24.160 --> 24:32.960]  Mr. President, how serious was the corruption among the Afghanistan government to this
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.120]  mission failing there?
[24:37.120 --> 24:40.800]  First of all, the mission hasn't failed yet.
[24:40.800 --> 24:50.320]  There is in Afghanistan and all parties there's been corruption.
[24:50.320 --> 24:55.240]  The question is, can there be an agreement on unity of purpose?
[24:55.240 --> 24:57.080]  What is the objective?
[24:57.080 --> 25:02.360]  For example, it started off there were going to be negotiations between the Taliban and
[25:02.360 --> 25:13.080]  the Afghan national security forces and the Afghan government that didn't come to fruition.
[25:13.080 --> 25:17.080]  So the question now is, where do they go from here?
[25:17.080 --> 25:22.280]  That the jury is still out, but the likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning
[25:22.280 --> 25:27.360]  everything and owning the whole country is highly.
[25:27.360 --> 25:39.280]  Wow, ladies and gentlemen, just simply, simply insane to witness that.
[25:39.280 --> 25:44.600]  And to know that he's a puppet, he doesn't know what's going on.
[25:44.600 --> 25:51.080]  But the handlers are now going to slowly destroy him and CNN is now putting out images.
[25:51.080 --> 25:52.080]  So is the New York Times.
[25:52.080 --> 25:53.920]  Oh, Troyer pointed this out last night.
[25:53.920 --> 25:58.040]  I had noticed it and I noticed it once he pointed it out everywhere of like real close
[25:58.040 --> 26:02.560]  where he cut himself shaving and a booger hanging out of his nose and him looking all
[26:02.560 --> 26:03.560]  crazy.
[26:03.560 --> 26:08.320]  Before they were trying to basically filter all that out now.
[26:08.320 --> 26:09.320]  He's terrible.
[26:09.320 --> 26:10.320]  Now he's a bad guy.
[26:10.320 --> 26:17.520]  Now it's all his fault because they're going to then maneuver in the next few months to
[26:17.520 --> 26:21.080]  try to bring somebody else in and you're like, well, that'll discredit the country.
[26:21.080 --> 26:22.880]  That'll that'll hurt the stock market.
[26:22.880 --> 26:25.800]  That'll, yeah, now you get the idea.
[26:25.800 --> 26:30.200]  We're being maneuvered towards the final collapse where they're going to blame a whole host
[26:30.200 --> 26:37.360]  of other reasons for it, COVID and terror attacks and oh, people questioning the election
[26:37.360 --> 26:41.040]  and Joe Biden, but it will never be the big mega banks.
[26:41.040 --> 26:45.600]  It will never be people that make Bernie Madoff look like a saint.
[26:45.600 --> 26:48.200]  And how do I know all this?
[26:48.200 --> 26:53.800]  Because they telegraph all this in their white papers and their books.
[26:53.800 --> 26:55.680]  I mean, it's all in Klaus Schwab's books.
[26:55.680 --> 26:58.080]  It's all in Bill Gates' statements.
[26:58.080 --> 27:03.240]  I said 15 months ago when Bill Gates was on three different shows, I saw, we played the
[27:03.240 --> 27:09.000]  clips here and I said, mark my word, hopefully the archives can find this 14, 15 months ago,
[27:09.000 --> 27:17.280]  he was on Colbert, he was on CNN as well on Fareed Zarkaria and one other show NBC and
[27:17.280 --> 27:20.840]  he said, listen, COVID's just a drill.
[27:20.840 --> 27:22.440]  It's not really a threat.
[27:22.440 --> 27:26.760]  Schwab said this to the next week, they all follow talking points, they love to tell their
[27:26.760 --> 27:27.760]  own people what they're doing.
[27:27.760 --> 27:29.400]  It's all like a joke on us.
[27:29.400 --> 27:36.160]  He goes, but soon terrorists are going to get a bio weapon.
[27:36.160 --> 27:39.480]  And he slipped up in one interview and he said, and they're going to incubate it.
[27:39.480 --> 27:44.960]  He loves to brag, little psycho demon, and he goes, and then it's going to be much, much
[27:44.960 --> 27:48.000]  worse, it could kill hundreds of millions of people.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  Remember that?
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.680]  And Colbert got really excited and was squirming around because he hangs out with Podesta on
[27:51.680 --> 27:52.680]  them as well.
[27:52.680 --> 27:53.680]  He's a real psycho.
[27:53.680 --> 27:55.840]  Colbert is really a psycho.
[27:55.840 --> 27:57.360]  He's right up there with him.
[27:57.360 --> 28:02.320]  And so I went on there and I said, oh my God, that's in all the literature that once you
[28:02.320 --> 28:07.880]  take this vaccine, it'll make you slough and shed the virus and give it to people.
[28:07.880 --> 28:08.880]  That's a scientific fact.
[28:08.880 --> 28:12.200]  I have a stack of these articles right here admitting it.
[28:12.200 --> 28:14.880]  And so, see, we're the terrorist, we're the disease.
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.080]  And so we are going to incubate the virus that then actually kills a bunch of people.
[28:20.080 --> 28:26.280]  And now half the people I know are currently sick with COVID.
[28:26.280 --> 28:29.120]  And they go get tested and they're COVID positive.
[28:29.120 --> 28:33.560]  Can you imagine what the winner is going to be like when it was fake before?
[28:33.560 --> 28:39.600]  It's a real virus they made, gain a function so you test positive, hurt some people that
[28:39.600 --> 28:42.240]  have vitamin D or C or any virus will.
[28:42.240 --> 28:45.920]  But see, they had to own the virus so they could create the vaccine, knowing that they'd
[28:45.920 --> 28:50.240]  already tested it, that that vaccine is what will then devastate those that take it and
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.000]  then turns them into a bio weapon lab to then release that on everybody else.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  We're going to get back into Afghanistan and take your calls and so much more.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  Stay with us.
[28:58.000 --> 29:03.480]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[29:03.480 --> 29:04.480]  Me too.
[29:04.480 --> 29:08.680]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[29:08.680 --> 29:11.400]  is one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:11.400 --> 29:15.760]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:15.760 --> 29:17.520]  You probably already believe that.
[29:17.520 --> 29:18.680]  I certainly do.
[29:18.680 --> 29:19.680]  So here's the thing.
[29:19.680 --> 29:24.080]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually
[29:24.080 --> 29:28.160]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:28.160 --> 29:33.920]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.
[29:33.920 --> 29:35.360]  No cures or treatments there.
[29:35.360 --> 29:39.920]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune
[29:39.920 --> 29:44.480]  support product based on that research called Immune 10x.
[29:44.480 --> 29:48.440]  In the best part, you can go to the Stronger Defense website right now and claim your own
[29:48.440 --> 29:52.320]  supply of Immune 10x without paying anything today.

[30:00.520 --> 30:05.360]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[30:05.360 --> 30:07.720]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[30:07.720 --> 30:12.280]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[30:12.280 --> 30:16.840]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[30:16.840 --> 30:20.160]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with X2, you had, you know, with a deep burden
[30:20.160 --> 30:22.160]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[30:22.160 --> 30:28.080]  So I took it and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain
[30:28.080 --> 30:29.080]  was enlightened.
[30:29.080 --> 30:33.920]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again, and over the course of
[30:33.920 --> 30:37.920]  the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all
[30:37.920 --> 30:38.920]  of your supplements.
[30:38.920 --> 30:40.920]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[30:40.920 --> 30:43.040]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[30:43.040 --> 30:45.320]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[30:45.320 --> 30:46.320]  It's amazing.
[30:46.320 --> 30:47.320]  It works.
[30:47.320 --> 30:50.480]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[30:50.480 --> 30:51.480]  the globalist system.
[30:51.480 --> 30:55.280]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[30:55.280 --> 31:00.160]  You've beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[31:00.160 --> 31:07.440]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[31:07.440 --> 31:13.200]  I was in sixth grade, and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[31:13.200 --> 31:14.200]  in the arena.
[31:14.200 --> 31:17.880]  And I just remember thinking about that saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[31:17.880 --> 31:21.800]  But when it comes to media, Info Wars has been the tip of that spear.
[31:21.800 --> 31:27.240]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better
[31:27.240 --> 31:30.040]  when it comes to election fraud and other issues.

[32:36.240 --> 32:40.720]  and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved

[33:02.960 --> 33:31.960]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:33.960 --> 33:39.960]  If we wake up to the globalist philosophy of designed implosion of civilization and
[33:39.960 --> 33:44.960]  the assanguation of all the technology and wealth into city-states with all the rest
[33:44.960 --> 33:50.880]  of us living in a type of Hunger Games scenario, we can rally humanity together and stop Agenda
[33:50.880 --> 33:53.680]  2030 and Agenda 2050.
[33:53.680 --> 33:58.080]  We didn't stop Agenda 21, we're inside of it right now, the post-industrial, post-human
[33:58.080 --> 34:00.080]  world.
[34:00.080 --> 34:03.600]  In the third hour, I'm going to open the phones up, and popping into the third hour
[34:03.600 --> 34:09.360]  is a medical doctor who they almost killed in a hospital in Florida, a very prominent
[34:09.360 --> 34:13.120]  person's father, was killed in the same hospital.
[34:13.120 --> 34:15.800]  They're not ready to come on at this point, but we have this doctor who also witnessed
[34:15.800 --> 34:20.280]  at the hospital coming on, and they also basically tried to kill Rob Duke, gave him
[34:20.280 --> 34:24.480]  no medicine, no steroids, no nothing, he went home and was fine, and of course they were
[34:24.480 --> 34:29.880]  coming at him with a ventilator, so this is a very serious situation.
[34:29.880 --> 34:33.600]  Dr. Stone joins us for the next two segments, I appreciate him coming on, he's been very
[34:33.600 --> 34:40.120]  busy taking care of his wife, amazing lady, who's got lymphoma cancer stage four, but
[34:40.120 --> 34:41.120]  she's fighting hard.
[34:41.120 --> 34:45.440]  I wanted to get him on a week ago about Cuomo, but he was just too busy with her, and I respect
[34:45.440 --> 34:49.280]  that and understand it, and then I wanted to get him on, obviously, about the Afghanistan
[34:49.280 --> 34:53.640]  thing, I called him yesterday, and he said, sure, we can get into that as well, he's had
[34:53.640 --> 34:56.840]  a lot of conversations with Trump, but can't say much about that, but we'll see what he
[34:56.840 --> 35:00.440]  can't say about the big guy, and then of course we've also got the Mike Lindell thing
[35:00.440 --> 35:04.920]  last week, where I watched a lot of it, I had great info came out, algorithms, proof
[35:04.920 --> 35:11.040]  of a lot of stuff around the world, that all got ignored by one poison pill, the same eight
[35:11.040 --> 35:17.800]  chan people that have set me up before, I've been through this rodeo, you live, you learn,
[35:17.800 --> 35:22.440]  I tried to warn Lindell on air and off air, but I'm not mad at him, he just got into this,
[35:22.440 --> 35:28.520]  he's bringing attention, so we're going to get Roger Stone's autopsy report on that situation
[35:28.520 --> 35:31.600]  and so much more, Roger, thank you for joining us.
[35:31.600 --> 35:38.720]  Alex, it's great to be back here on Info Wars, I feel like I'm home, but we got a lot to
[35:38.720 --> 35:43.240]  go over, there's a lot happening in the country, so let's have at it.
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.200]  What do you want to tackle first, Afghanistan?
[35:47.200 --> 35:52.480]  That's a good enough place to start, because of course it's dominating the news.
[35:52.480 --> 35:58.160]  The notion that we should be withdrawing our troops from the endless foreign wars around
[35:58.160 --> 36:04.320]  the globe, where the neocons placed them, was one of the central tenants that got Donald
[36:04.320 --> 36:14.760]  Trump elected, however, Donald Trump strategically covered our retreat with tactical precision
[36:14.760 --> 36:20.400]  bombing of Al Qaeda, pardon me, of the Taliban.
[36:20.400 --> 36:25.840]  Biden has not done that, so in other words, he is just withdrawn, and I think he increased
[36:25.840 --> 36:33.160]  the chances of the Taliban overrunning the country, because the method in which he withdrew.
[36:33.160 --> 36:40.080]  This is incompetence, I can go back and figure out how many tons of bombage the President
[36:40.080 --> 36:46.720]  Trump delivered against the Taliban when we were in the process of withdrawing.
[36:46.720 --> 36:51.640]  The fundamental problem here I think is pretty clear, you and I and most of the folks watching
[36:51.640 --> 36:59.000]  are not neocons, so we never should have gone to Afghanistan to begin with, while there,
[36:59.000 --> 37:06.120]  while we may have provided a stabilizing force, the problem was always the same, whether we
[37:06.120 --> 37:13.120]  withdrew tomorrow or whether we withdrew 20 years from now, it was highly unlikely to
[37:13.120 --> 37:18.200]  collapse into chaos, tribal warfare and so on.
[37:18.200 --> 37:20.440]  So at what point do you pull the plug?
[37:20.440 --> 37:26.640]  At what point do you say, enough American treasure, enough American blood, enough American
[37:26.640 --> 37:28.920]  dollars, and withdraw?
[37:28.920 --> 37:35.880]  So in this case, Biden's instincts were solid, but the way in which he did this was a major
[37:35.880 --> 37:36.880]  major blunder.
[37:36.880 --> 37:43.120]  Well I was about to say, the military industrial complex wanted to stay there, and so you said
[37:43.120 --> 37:48.480]  it perfectly because I've talked to people that were deployed high level there, CIA and
[37:48.480 --> 37:52.920]  army and other groups just in the last 48 hours, talked to a lot of folks, made a lot
[37:52.920 --> 37:57.840]  of phone calls, and they all said what you said, they said look at 1991, Saddam is racing
[37:57.840 --> 38:04.080]  back out of Kuwait into Iraq, tens of thousands of troops, hundreds of tanks, thousands of
[38:04.080 --> 38:09.400]  tanks and vehicles, and just a few dozen A-10 Warthogs destroyed all of them right there.
[38:09.400 --> 38:13.280]  So the Taliban wouldn't have come out on all those roads the same way and filled them up
[38:13.280 --> 38:19.760]  with five, ten mile long convoys to take the main cities if they knew there was going to
[38:19.760 --> 38:27.080]  be U.S. air support guarding the controlled build down, as they call it, or retreat.
[38:27.080 --> 38:34.360]  Only if U.S. air power was going to back up, at least for a while, the Afghan freedom
[38:34.360 --> 38:35.920]  forces, they call it, are fighting force.
[38:35.920 --> 38:40.560]  So this was perfectly done to destroy the region, give it to the Taliban, you didn't
[38:40.560 --> 38:43.880]  misspeak, they are Al-Qaeda, that's what it came out of, this is kind of the mother
[38:43.880 --> 38:45.240]  of Al-Qaeda.
[38:45.240 --> 38:50.960]  And so the people above Biden, the controllers of Biden have done this by design, they want
[38:50.960 --> 38:55.360]  to go back into the future, they want to destabilize that area of the world, but tell me if you
[38:55.360 --> 39:00.200]  agree with that statement, A, and then B, Roger Stone, what does this do to the puppet
[39:00.200 --> 39:01.200]  Biden?
[39:01.200 --> 39:04.200]  I mean, this has just destroyed him, in my view.
[39:04.200 --> 39:07.560]  Well, I think this is harmful overall.
[39:07.560 --> 39:13.080]  First of all, we don't seem to ever listen or learn from the rules of history.
[39:13.080 --> 39:19.960]  One of the reasons that Reagan was able to essentially facilitate the collapse of Soviet
[39:19.960 --> 39:28.080]  Russia as a military force was the fact that they had gotten themselves mired in Afghanistan,
[39:28.080 --> 39:31.120]  and they were being bled to death by the Taliban.
[39:31.120 --> 39:33.800]  We were sitting back and watching.
[39:33.800 --> 39:38.760]  That was a key factor in Reagan's ability to squeeze the Russians.
[39:38.760 --> 39:43.840]  Then immediately upon the election of George Bush, we turned around and put our foot in
[39:43.840 --> 39:50.440]  the exact same bear trap we had just seen the Russians grapple with, never made any sense.
[39:50.440 --> 39:55.200]  You have to look, I think, across the foreign policy landscape.
[39:55.200 --> 40:00.760]  The North Koreans are threatening us with more vigor than ever before.
[40:00.760 --> 40:06.640]  The Red Chinese are harassing our ships in the South China Sea.
[40:06.640 --> 40:13.160]  The Russians have troops massed on the border of Crimea, making it very clear what their
[40:13.160 --> 40:20.160]  intentions are, and now the manner in which this Afghanistan withdrawal was staged just
[40:20.160 --> 40:25.360]  underlies the fundamental weakness of the Biden foreign policy.
[40:25.360 --> 40:32.640]  I'm not a big fan of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, but he called this one exactly
[40:32.640 --> 40:33.640]  right.
[40:33.640 --> 40:37.840]  The manner in which we did this was a disaster.
[40:37.840 --> 40:42.280]  Clearly, there are forces that wanted to stay there.
[40:42.280 --> 40:47.320]  Do you think they misadvised Biden to then be able to have a fiasco where we've got
[40:47.320 --> 40:48.800]  to go back in later?
[40:48.800 --> 40:51.440]  It's certainly conceivable.
[40:51.440 --> 40:56.760]  Let's recognize that during the entire time of the Trump presidency, every time he wanted
[40:56.760 --> 41:04.800]  to withdraw our troops from Iraq or Afghanistan or Syria, there were vigorous objections from
[41:04.800 --> 41:10.560]  the Pentagon and, of course, Lindsey Graham and others went out of their minds.
[41:10.560 --> 41:17.000]  They can't argue with the fundamental premise that the only thing right now maintaining
[41:17.000 --> 41:24.280]  stability is our presence, but how long do we have to pay for this, and how much of what
[41:24.280 --> 41:28.560]  we send there is essentially just being looted, being stolen.
[41:28.560 --> 41:31.400]  I saw pictures of the president's palace.
[41:31.400 --> 41:32.600]  Looks pretty nice.
[41:32.600 --> 41:35.360]  I think the American taxpayers paid for that.
[41:35.360 --> 41:41.000]  Well, we certainly did, and now cavemen have taken over when they could have all been destroyed
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.240]  on the highway.
[41:42.240 --> 41:43.240]  That's the real proof here.
[41:43.240 --> 41:48.600]  As you said, no air cover, total stand down, let them take over.
[41:48.600 --> 41:51.280]  This is just incredible.
[41:51.280 --> 41:58.200]  It really is, but I think it will also have the effect of reminding the American people
[41:58.200 --> 42:01.800]  about the dangers of Islamic terrorism.
[42:01.800 --> 42:07.800]  This is something Laura Loomer has been particularly effective on, so this is not, what did they
[42:07.800 --> 42:08.800]  tell us?
[42:08.800 --> 42:12.120]  We had the Taliban on the run, the Bush administration told us.
[42:12.120 --> 42:14.280]  They were virtually destroyed.
[42:14.280 --> 42:15.280]  Clearly that is not the case.
[42:15.280 --> 42:19.520]  We're going to go to break, and we're going to come back and get into Cuomo and what that
[42:19.520 --> 42:22.600]  signifies to the Democrats, why they're throwing out of the bus, what's coming next.
[42:22.600 --> 42:28.840]  We're also going to update on your wife, and I know that this is a sticky subject with
[42:28.840 --> 42:35.120]  Roger, but I heard she took the Pfizer shot before she got cancer, lymphoma cancer, which
[42:35.120 --> 42:38.200]  they say the Pfizer flares up that.
[42:38.200 --> 42:41.440]  It's a hard subject, and we'll see if he'll talk about it.
[42:41.440 --> 42:45.400]  On the other side, Roger Stone is our guest, we'll also tell you about his podcast and
[42:45.400 --> 42:46.400]  his show, and more.
[42:46.400 --> 42:48.600]  Remember, he's just like me.
[42:48.600 --> 42:52.480]  The Taliban, which is al-Qaeda basically, has its Twitter and made its official announcement
[42:52.480 --> 42:53.480]  on Twitter.
[42:53.480 --> 43:02.640]  Roger and I and the president, we're not allowed, because we're evil dirty Americans.
[43:02.640 --> 43:04.640]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[43:04.640 --> 43:05.640]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[43:05.640 --> 43:06.640]  Good, bro.
[43:06.640 --> 43:07.640]  Great last caller.
[43:07.640 --> 43:10.160]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[43:10.160 --> 43:14.920]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore, with all the gaslighting, the moralization,
[43:14.920 --> 43:15.920]  and absurdity.
[43:15.920 --> 43:17.920]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[43:17.920 --> 43:19.920]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[43:19.920 --> 43:20.920]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[43:20.920 --> 43:21.920]  Go ahead.
[43:21.920 --> 43:22.920]  Hey, Alex.
[43:22.920 --> 43:26.040]  Hey, if I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[43:26.040 --> 43:27.680]  The X2 does wonders.
[43:27.680 --> 43:30.080]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[43:30.080 --> 43:31.080]  Get off the fence.
[43:31.080 --> 43:32.080]  Get the product.
[43:32.080 --> 43:33.080]  Support the import.
[43:33.080 --> 43:34.080]  Tyler in Maine.
[43:34.080 --> 43:35.080]  You're on the year.
[43:35.080 --> 43:36.080]  Thanks for holding.
[43:36.080 --> 43:37.080]  Go ahead.
[43:37.080 --> 43:38.080]  Hey, Alex.
[43:38.080 --> 43:39.080]  It's great to be on with you.
[43:39.080 --> 43:40.080]  It's an honor.
[43:40.080 --> 43:41.080]  Honored to talk to you.
[43:41.080 --> 43:42.080]  Awesome.
[43:42.080 --> 43:45.880]  So, firstly, I wanted to do is say, I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[43:45.880 --> 43:50.720]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one
[43:50.720 --> 43:51.720]  for a few words.
[43:51.720 --> 43:53.320]  It's not a joke.
[43:53.320 --> 43:54.320]  Absolutely.
[43:54.320 --> 44:03.080]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[44:03.080 --> 44:07.280]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[44:07.280 --> 44:10.480]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[44:10.480 --> 44:13.560]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they
[44:13.560 --> 44:14.880]  can to shut us down.
[44:14.880 --> 44:19.200]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air, and please support the local station you're
[44:19.200 --> 44:20.200]  listening to as well.
[44:20.200 --> 44:25.400]  And at the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get
[44:25.400 --> 44:30.480]  a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay
[44:30.480 --> 44:32.680]  on air in the face of this thing.
[44:32.680 --> 44:34.800]  I need your help more than ever now.
[44:34.800 --> 44:39.120]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[44:39.120 --> 44:44.520]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great
[44:44.520 --> 44:49.800]  products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com, whether
[44:49.800 --> 44:54.360]  it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[44:54.360 --> 44:59.360]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[44:59.360 --> 45:01.560]  Thank you so much.
[45:01.560 --> 45:05.560]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six
[45:05.560 --> 45:09.880]  plus months of where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and an off-wash.
[45:09.880 --> 45:13.320]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a best seller within six months,
[45:13.320 --> 45:17.160]  and now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain, we haven't
[45:17.160 --> 45:18.160]  had it.
[45:18.160 --> 45:22.200]  Finally, it came back in, a limited supply, believe me, I'm happy too.
[45:22.200 --> 45:24.120]  It's a great toothpaste and it funds the info war.
[45:24.120 --> 45:26.920]  So if you want to get it and stock up on it because you were already a fan or you haven't
[45:26.920 --> 45:33.600]  tried it, it's back in stock at infowarstore.com, discounted because of the COVID lockdown.
[45:33.600 --> 45:37.880]  Because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America, it's not been available
[45:37.880 --> 45:39.120]  for over six months.
[45:39.120 --> 45:45.760]  But now it's back in stock and it's available at only two places, infowarstore.com and Dr.
[45:45.760 --> 45:48.160]  Jones naturals.com.
[45:48.160 --> 45:51.560]  It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.360]  So get your activated charcoal toothpaste, activated charcoal mouthwash with essential
[45:55.360 --> 46:02.160]  oils and more at infowarstore.com and fund the info war, a true 360 win.
[46:02.160 --> 46:07.320]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid 1990s, and then imagine a science fiction movie set
[46:07.320 --> 46:12.360]  in the year 2020 where a world government is being established, where members of Congress
[46:12.360 --> 46:17.240]  and former presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental
[46:17.240 --> 46:23.200]  injection that grows blood clots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed
[46:23.200 --> 46:25.800]  to fly on an airplane.
[46:25.800 --> 46:28.440]  Think about that because that's where we are.
[46:28.440 --> 46:33.400]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would
[46:33.400 --> 46:34.400]  be happening.
[46:34.400 --> 46:36.400]  But it is happening now.
[46:36.400 --> 46:40.520]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy and it doesn't
[46:40.520 --> 46:41.520]  really work.
[46:41.520 --> 46:43.440]  You've got to take it every few months.
[46:43.440 --> 46:47.600]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go
[46:47.600 --> 46:51.160]  outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[46:51.160 --> 46:55.280]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding
[46:55.280 --> 46:56.280]  of the virus.
[46:56.280 --> 46:58.120]  And that's in mainline studies.
[46:58.120 --> 47:03.920]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[47:03.920 --> 47:19.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:19.240 --> 47:24.920]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[47:24.920 --> 47:33.400]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to end one of the biggest sales of the year tomorrow.
[47:33.400 --> 47:38.360]  It's 50% off on Survival Shield X2, the deep earth crystal iodine that is essential for
[47:38.360 --> 47:39.440]  your immune system.
[47:39.440 --> 47:41.880]  So many people don't know it's essential.
[47:41.880 --> 47:43.560]  You die without iodine.
[47:43.560 --> 47:47.640]  The UN admits that over 2 billion people have cognitive disabilities because of lack of
[47:47.640 --> 47:48.640]  iodine.
[47:48.640 --> 47:54.360]  We have the best 50% off at infowarstore.com and we are going to get a new shipment in
[47:54.360 --> 47:55.360]  about a month.
[47:55.360 --> 47:56.360]  We're very close to selling out.
[47:56.360 --> 48:00.400]  So I'm going to keep it on sale 50% off until tomorrow evening and then we've got a new
[48:00.400 --> 48:04.760]  sale on Wednesday, one of our best-selling products, Vitamemeral Fusions will be back
[48:04.760 --> 48:07.360]  in stock, but that will be the sale when that happens.
[48:07.360 --> 48:13.080]  The booster body's natural defenses, 70% off, sale ends tomorrow.
[48:13.080 --> 48:17.160]  The vitamin C was zinc, it sold out, a bunch of other stuff sold out, Survival Shield X2,

[48:44.760 --> 48:50.440]  Now, Roger did not solicit this, but we had a long talk yesterday and I know you guys
[48:50.440 --> 48:55.880]  out there want to support Patriots to keep him in the fight and we sent Roger the equipment
[48:55.880 --> 48:56.880]  so he could do his podcast.
[48:56.880 --> 49:00.800]  We want to try to get it on with us, he posted it, Band-Aut Video, it's very popular, the
[49:00.800 --> 49:04.520]  average report, it's about 50,000 views, but go check that out at Band-Aut Video, he's
[49:04.520 --> 49:10.160]  also doing well with this podcast, but I have a dog in the fight here, a dog in the hunt
[49:10.160 --> 49:16.240]  as they say when it comes to his wife, she's a great lady, I care about her and if I can
[49:16.240 --> 49:20.840]  use an example of something that's happened to somebody to warn others, I will do it and
[49:20.840 --> 49:26.360]  so I brought this up because I heard about this from a family friend of the Stones about
[49:26.360 --> 49:33.640]  a week ago and so I called Roger yesterday and I said, did your lovely, beautiful, awesome
[49:33.640 --> 49:38.920]  wife take a vaccine and he said, yes, but I don't want to get into it and I really pinned
[49:38.920 --> 49:45.160]  him down, I said, just tell me and he said, Pfizer and he said, but that's her business
[49:45.160 --> 49:48.680]  and I said, she's got lymphoma cancer, I said, are you aware in the literature, we put it
[49:48.680 --> 49:52.320]  on screen that those swell up and it's been triggering cancer in the lymph nodes, they've
[49:52.320 --> 49:58.640]  just swept it under the rug, also in the uterus and he was not aware of that, but I found
[49:58.640 --> 50:03.080]  the articles during the break guys, you put them on screen place, so again, I don't want
[50:03.080 --> 50:06.880]  to get in his business, I don't want to get in his life, but we care about her and we
[50:06.880 --> 50:13.240]  care about everybody and again, it's attacking the breast, the uterus and it's also going
[50:13.240 --> 50:16.520]  after the lymph nodes and they're saying, oh, don't worry about a cancer designation
[50:16.520 --> 50:21.160]  the first six months after you had a shot, except they're going in and saying it is malignant,
[50:21.160 --> 50:26.280]  there it is, that's the ABC news on screen, so to me, this is a huge issue, Roger and
[50:26.280 --> 50:31.600]  I just wanted to say, I want to see your wife beat this, she's a tough lady, so tell us
[50:31.600 --> 50:35.160]  about as much as you can, I heard this from somebody, please don't get mad, you got mad
[50:35.160 --> 50:40.160]  yesterday, I never violate your wishes, but this time I kind of halfway didn't I apologize,
[50:40.160 --> 50:44.960]  but I just, I care about her and just please tell us what happened.
[50:44.960 --> 50:51.400]  Well Alex, I'm not going to count, I'm not going to comment on the specifics of my wife's
[50:51.400 --> 50:56.240]  health situation, other than to say, she's a strong independent woman, she makes her
[50:56.240 --> 51:05.080]  own decisions, I will confirm she has non-Hodgkins lymphoma, it has started in her armpit and
[51:05.080 --> 51:13.760]  spread to her lungs, she is waging a very broad battle against cancer, both medicinally
[51:13.760 --> 51:20.120]  using a substantial number of homeopathic and holistic remedies that I have researched
[51:20.120 --> 51:26.880]  extensively, and of course there is the spiritual battle, so I'm not going to comment on what
[51:26.880 --> 51:32.200]  you said, I'm going to let it sit because I do think she's entitled to her privacy,
[51:32.200 --> 51:39.240]  the fact that I'm a vaccination skeptic, you know my views, but every individual person
[51:39.240 --> 51:46.120]  must make a decision for themselves whether to have the vaccination or not.
[51:46.120 --> 51:53.160]  I'm aware of the growing bank of data that demonstrates that the vaccination does not
[51:53.160 --> 52:01.520]  appear to be safe, if there were any FDA approved vaccination or improved injection on the market
[52:01.520 --> 52:06.760]  today with 45,000 deaths, it would have been pulled by now.
[52:06.760 --> 52:13.040]  So I'm opposed to the designation by the FDA for permanent status of a vaccination that
[52:13.040 --> 52:19.840]  did not go through clinical trials, and I think it is kind of obvious to everyone that
[52:19.840 --> 52:27.680]  if the big manufacturers have no legal liability for the side effects of that which they produce,
[52:27.680 --> 52:34.600]  they bear no responsibility, there's no downside to them if in fact we learn in the long term
[52:34.600 --> 52:38.800]  that these vaccinations are extraordinarily dangerous.
[52:38.800 --> 52:42.940]  Perfectly well said, let me just say this respectfully, because I want to save lives
[52:42.940 --> 52:47.460]  and I understand people's privacy and people's issues and I totally get it sir, and we're
[52:47.460 --> 52:50.680]  good friends, I was told this by somebody pretty close to you and they were saying
[52:50.680 --> 52:56.560]  I ought to try to get you or her on to warn people, but it's a pretty big deal that Roger
[52:56.560 --> 53:00.320]  Stone's wife took the Pfizer, you confirm that, and then what three, four months later
[53:00.320 --> 53:04.720]  got diagnosed with lymphoma cancer when that's one of the main things, and they say oh don't
[53:04.720 --> 53:10.360]  worry it's not really cancer, but it is, that is such a bombshell thing, and of course
[53:10.360 --> 53:15.480]  we don't blame her, people trust their doctors, normal vaccines actually do work a lot of
[53:15.480 --> 53:21.360]  the time, this isn't really a vaccine, so I'm sorry to get into your business, and I
[53:21.360 --> 53:26.560]  apologize for it, but then I still do it, just because this is a big deal.
[53:26.560 --> 53:33.960]  Well let me put it this way, back in February, my wife who as you know was my absolute rock
[53:33.960 --> 53:40.800]  during my trial, who was absolutely adamant that I not even consider the efforts by Robert
[53:40.800 --> 53:46.120]  Mueller to make me flip and testify falsely against the president, which they wanted to
[53:46.120 --> 53:52.000]  use as an article of impeachment against him, I can't imagine life without her, she's always
[53:52.000 --> 53:58.720]  been there for me, back in February however she had a full physical with blood work, chest
[53:58.720 --> 54:04.640]  x-rays and so on, and she was in perfect health, so this has come quickly, I'm neither going
[54:04.640 --> 54:10.600]  to confirm nor deny her status in terms of the vaccination, because I think it's a private
[54:10.600 --> 54:18.640]  matter, and this is a public forum, but this kind of aggressive stage for cancer, this
[54:18.640 --> 54:22.080]  quickly is extraordinarily rare.
[54:22.080 --> 54:25.040]  Okay, but Roger, the point is, because this is important for the news, because I want
[54:25.040 --> 54:30.200]  to save lives here by people learning about this, I'm not making this up though.
[54:30.200 --> 54:34.480]  I'm not claiming that you did, all I'm saying is that I would neither confirm it or deny
[54:34.480 --> 54:37.320]  it, but I think I made my position here very clear.
[54:37.320 --> 54:40.760]  No, no you have, you have, just, well thank you for doing that, let's go to break, come
[54:40.760 --> 54:43.560]  back and get into qualmo, but you didn't ask for this, but I want to do it, let's make
[54:43.560 --> 54:47.520]  sure she gets the treatment she needs, including all the natural stuff she's doing on top of
[54:47.520 --> 54:51.240]  it, and you said she's a trooper, tell us how your wife's doing it, how do people, because
[54:51.240 --> 54:54.480]  they want to hurt you, they want to hurt her, we want to keep you in the fight, you're like
[54:54.480 --> 54:58.440]  a standard of patriotism, they want to bring down, the left hates you, how do we support
[54:58.440 --> 55:02.840]  Roger Stone, how do we find your show, how do we get your book, how do we buy your t-shirts?
[55:02.840 --> 55:09.000]  Well, the key here is that I was forced to become kind of an expert on cancer, studying
[55:09.000 --> 55:16.120]  every single therapy I could that was both all natural and non-toxic, for example, intravenous
[55:16.120 --> 55:23.360]  infusions of certain, at mega dose levels of certain vitamins, C, D, B17, and certain
[55:23.360 --> 55:30.760]  other peptides, THC and CBD therapy, these things are extraordinarily expensive, Mueller
[55:30.760 --> 55:36.560]  wiped us out financially, I think people know that, the Biden Justice Department is suing
[55:36.560 --> 55:42.720]  me today in a civil action against back taxes, which they will lose, so people who want to
[55:42.720 --> 55:50.360]  help us, pay for the alternative therapies to help my wife, can go to stonefamilyfund.com,
[55:50.360 --> 55:51.360]  stonefamilyfund.com.
[55:51.360 --> 55:59.120]  Alex, I've got to be honest with you, I've had to put, finishing my book aside, my podcast
[55:59.120 --> 56:06.480]  Get Stoned, now on the excluded.com network, has taken a bit of a back seat, formal launch
[56:06.480 --> 56:11.960]  is in September, my main focus right now is my wife's health, and making sure she has
[56:11.960 --> 56:15.800]  everything she needs to wage this incredible battle.
[56:15.800 --> 56:20.400]  Well, that's right, and again, listeners have kept us on air, I'm really proud of the listeners,
[56:20.400 --> 56:25.720]  by the way, since they tried to set up Lindell and planted that fake info on him, most of
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.880]  his information was accurate, he did a great job, we've actually seen sales at mypillow.com
[56:30.880 --> 56:35.600]  with promo code AlexIncrease, and so I want to just salute, and thank all the listeners
[56:35.600 --> 56:39.400]  for keeping us all on air, we're not perfect, we stumble, we fall, but we mean well, and

[56:55.480 --> 56:59.360]  a donation to really fight for your wife's life, after all you've done, after what she's

[58:48.160 --> 58:50.440]  for your support.
[58:50.440 --> 58:55.280]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight,
[58:55.280 --> 59:00.200]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard
[59:00.200 --> 59:03.840]  Dr. Group on their show and I listened to it, so the first one I got was the original
[59:03.840 --> 59:08.160]  survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good, and then shortly thereafter you came
[59:08.160 --> 59:11.640]  out with that stew, you know, with a deep-burdened source, you know, and I got really excited
[59:11.640 --> 59:16.680]  about that, so I took it, and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally
[59:16.680 --> 59:21.880]  like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people
[59:21.880 --> 59:26.840]  again, and over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[59:26.840 --> 59:31.240]  take basically all of your supplements, they're all absolutely amazing supplements, the one
[59:31.240 --> 59:35.960]  I like recently is knockout, literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it, it's amazing,
[59:35.960 --> 59:39.800]  it works, but anyways, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break
[59:39.800 --> 59:44.200]  free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into
[59:44.200 --> 59:45.200]  our own hands.
[59:45.200 --> 59:53.440]  You've beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[59:53.440 --> 1:00:11.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:11.480 --> 1:00:15.360]  I was just talking to Roger Stone here on the Alex Jones show during the break, and
[1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:23.080]  he was talking about the fact that Homeland Security has officially come out and said
[1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:27.840]  protesting lockdowns is an act of terror, and just craziness, we'll briefly talk about
[1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:30.840]  that, start the next segment, then I'm going to air a special report on it, then give the
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:36.080]  number out, take your calls, but let's get into Cuomo right now, obviously corrupt New
[1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:40.240]  York politician, a globalist, but they would have protected him unless they had a larger
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:45.280]  message they wanted to send, I mean, they certainly don't want to indict him for killing
[1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:51.720]  20,000 people with COVID infected patients by design, so is it a stopgap measure just
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:53.800]  to get rid of him because he's such an embarrassment?
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:57.160]  What's the inside baseball because I know you've got one foot in New York.
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:02.080]  I think people need to understand that Cuomo was taken down not by conservatives, not by
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:08.680]  Republicans, not by the media, but by the progressive left, because essentially they
[1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:16.000]  recognize that he's a master politician, he's also a thug, he knows how to wield power
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:21.360]  and he's someone you don't cross, they know that he was late coming to the progressive
[1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:28.520]  agenda of marriage equality, legalization of cannabis, even abortion.
[1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:32.560]  That's exactly what I thought you'd say, he wanted to reopen New York and tried to, they
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:37.640]  know he's not, he's a thug, but he's an old fashioned Democrat, he's not a Klaus Schwab
[1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:39.000]  guy.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:46.800]  And here's the real irony, there is no prospect whatsoever for any white male Democrat to win
[1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:50.120]  a statewide office in New York going forward.
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:55.880]  That wing of the Democratic Party, as represented by Joe Crowley, the congressman who got beat
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:02:02.560]  by OAC, is a dying breed and therefore the Democratic Party will continue, particularly
[1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:09.840]  in New York but nationally, to be controlled by its special interest groups, unions, minorities
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:11.560]  and so on.
[1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:18.560]  Andrew Cuomo is a tough, wily, resilient, combatant who understood power and how to
[1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:19.560]  use it.
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:26.120]  But he's kind of like the lion tamer who keeps three different lions up on the stand simultaneously.
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:33.000]  If he slips, all four lions attack him and that's exactly what has happened here.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:40.160]  And the irony that he's being removed on a Me Too issue as opposed to being removed because
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:48.880]  of the fudging of COVID numbers in New York and his inserting people who are extraordinarily
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:54.760]  vulnerable into nursing homes, resulting in many, many deaths, the deaths specifically
[1:02:54.760 --> 1:02:59.800]  of one good friend of mine whose father passed away under those circumstances.
[1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:05.720]  I don't see him staging a comeback, although today's New York Post is all about it.
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:15.160]  He does continue to have an enormous, multi-million dollar war chest and he is resilient.
[1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:18.640]  He should never be counted out.
[1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:26.640]  That was very poetic the way you, very Tennessee Williams, the way you described the lion tamer
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:28.760]  with four, three or four lions in front of him.
[1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:34.160]  I mean, the Democratic Party is a psychotic race-based group of loons who literally have
[1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:38.840]  taught people to hate white people and they openly say, Congress women, you name it.
[1:03:38.840 --> 1:03:42.600]  I'm going to have security for two million dollars a year but we're getting rid of the
[1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:43.600]  police.
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:46.600]  I mean, it's like a death of logic.
[1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:47.600]  What the hell?
[1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:50.920]  What is the Democrat Party going to be, I mean, they are, they are degenerating by
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:53.040]  the minute.
[1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:55.440]  Cuomo was a, was an anachronism.
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:04:00.560]  I mean, for a long period of time while the Democrats in New York controlled the assembly,
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:06.960]  Cuomo supported a coalition of Republicans and a handful of renegade moderate Democrats
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:09.480]  who had temporary control of the Senate.
[1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:13.560]  He did this as a stop gap on the far left assembly.
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:20.920]  So he is a realist, a political realist and people don't recognize that in the Democratic
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:28.880]  Party in 2014, when he was opposed by a school teacher with no name ID and no resources,
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:35.480]  she got 40%, 45% of the vote against a guy spending millions of dollars.
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:39.080]  So the progressive left has had its revenge.
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:45.680]  Cuomo, who they hate, is now out of the way, but let's point out that within the last
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:51.680]  10 years, two Democratic governors of New York have resigned in sex scandals, both Andrew
[1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:57.800]  Cuomo and Elliott Spitzer, as well as the state attorney general Eric Snyder.
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:00.160]  Back in 60 seconds, stay with us.
[1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:07.480]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:13.200]  I was in sixth grade, and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man
[1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:14.200]  in the arena.
[1:05:14.200 --> 1:05:18.000]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:21.840]  But when it comes to media, info wars has been the tip of that spear.
[1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:27.280]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better
[1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:30.080]  when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:35.880]  And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66%
[1:05:35.880 --> 1:05:37.800]  off on all the amazing products.

[1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:45.040]  And then you fund info wars and Mike Lindell and the fight for free speech against the
[1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:46.040]  globalist.
[1:05:46.040 --> 1:05:50.200]  There's not a better place to spend your money than mypillow.com with promo code Alex.

[1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:25.820]  As soon as we saw the first press conferences by General Milley and by Saki and others six
[1:06:25.820 --> 1:06:30.620]  seven months ago in the Biden administration, we're like, whoa, they were saying protesting
[1:06:30.620 --> 1:06:33.940]  the elections terrorist protesting other lockdowns terrorists.
[1:06:33.940 --> 1:06:35.660]  We said, well, obviously another lockdown is coming.
[1:06:35.660 --> 1:06:40.860]  Well, the NBC news and others reported this on Friday and Saturday.
[1:06:40.860 --> 1:06:44.980]  Opposition to COVID measures, the number one terror threat claims of election fraud believe
[1:06:44.980 --> 1:06:52.300]  Trump can be reinstated the number two terror threat at the 9 11 anniversary, not Islamic
[1:06:52.300 --> 1:06:53.460]  and religious holidays.
[1:06:53.460 --> 1:06:59.180]  So the Islamic threat attacking Christians on Christian holidays or Jews on Jewish holidays,
[1:06:59.180 --> 1:07:00.980]  that's threat number three.
[1:07:00.980 --> 1:07:02.460]  And yes, how do we know this was coming?
[1:07:02.460 --> 1:07:07.140]  Well, it was in the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism put out in June, where it
[1:07:07.140 --> 1:07:11.780]  says and I showed you this again yesterday, that it's an active thought crime and that
[1:07:11.780 --> 1:07:16.620]  the CIA and FBI will frustrate your operation, stop you, give you challenge the election
[1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:18.580]  or question the vaccines.
[1:07:18.580 --> 1:07:23.380]  I don't see this as a sign of strength, Roger Stone, former top political advisor to President
[1:07:23.380 --> 1:07:24.380]  Trump.
[1:07:24.380 --> 1:07:25.940]  I see this as a real sign of weakness.
[1:07:25.940 --> 1:07:31.420]  What do you make of this Tucker Carlson very effectively made that exact case.
[1:07:31.420 --> 1:07:33.180]  I mean, let's be clear.
[1:07:33.180 --> 1:07:40.820]  First of all, the idea that any American believes that the results of the 2020 election were
[1:07:40.820 --> 1:07:46.140]  not accurate, we're not honest, you have a constitutional right to both think that and
[1:07:46.140 --> 1:07:50.540]  to say it, that doesn't make you violent doesn't mean you're advocating the overthrow
[1:07:50.540 --> 1:07:55.980]  of the government doesn't it doesn't mean that you're advocating any illegal act.
[1:07:55.980 --> 1:08:02.300]  It is merely an opinion, an opinion based on an enormous amount of evidence of both
[1:08:02.300 --> 1:08:05.660]  anomalies and irregularities in the election.
[1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:10.300]  Then there's the separate question of believing that Donald Trump will be reinstated.
[1:08:10.300 --> 1:08:16.260]  I've never believed that there is no constitutional or legal precedent for that.
[1:08:16.260 --> 1:08:21.740]  I never believed once Joe Biden was certified by the Electoral College, I thought he would
[1:08:21.740 --> 1:08:28.300]  fill out the remainder of his term, assuming that his health continues to be sufficient
[1:08:28.300 --> 1:08:29.940]  to do that.
[1:08:29.940 --> 1:08:31.620]  So those are two different questions.
[1:08:31.620 --> 1:08:38.860]  But the most important thing is people who share these views are not advocating violence
[1:08:38.860 --> 1:08:42.620]  against the government, the violent overthrow of the government.
[1:08:42.620 --> 1:08:44.220]  They are not dangerous.
[1:08:44.220 --> 1:08:50.060]  They are merely formulating and expressing their own opinion as allowed by the first
[1:08:50.060 --> 1:08:51.060]  Well, exactly.
[1:08:51.060 --> 1:08:54.700]  I can play hours of compilations of Democrats attacking Dominion.
[1:08:54.700 --> 1:08:58.060]  Democrats saying the voting machines were fraud right up until the election.
[1:08:58.060 --> 1:09:00.420]  Now they're saying it's an act of terror to question it.
[1:09:00.420 --> 1:09:01.420]  That's just outrageous.
[1:09:01.420 --> 1:09:04.460]  Well, I think there's a legal purpose for this.
[1:09:04.460 --> 1:09:12.580]  You see, if they identify any individual as a domestic terrorist, they no longer have
[1:09:12.580 --> 1:09:21.660]  to go to a judge to get warrants to surveil their email, text messages, phone calls, movements,
[1:09:21.660 --> 1:09:23.700]  and so on.
[1:09:23.700 --> 1:09:27.820]  These are part of the post 9-11 reforms that were passed.
[1:09:27.820 --> 1:09:28.820]  Exactly.
[1:09:28.820 --> 1:09:32.980]  They're not taking the whole Homeland Security, Patriot Act, enemy combatant that they used
[1:09:32.980 --> 1:09:37.580]  on myself and you and the president, and they're now openly declaring 80 million-plus
[1:09:37.580 --> 1:09:38.580]  voters terrorist.
[1:09:38.580 --> 1:09:40.220]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[1:09:40.220 --> 1:09:42.580]  This is so historical, Roger.
[1:09:42.580 --> 1:09:48.580]  And let's remember the Republicans in both houses voted to reinstate or renew these policies
[1:09:48.580 --> 1:09:52.140]  with the exception of my favorite Senator Rand Paul.
[1:09:52.140 --> 1:09:53.380]  Let me say it again.
[1:09:53.380 --> 1:09:55.560]  We do not advocate violence.
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:59.140]  We do not advocate the violent overthrow of the government.
[1:09:59.140 --> 1:10:02.340]  We do not advocate harming any other person.
[1:10:02.340 --> 1:10:08.340]  I would like to see us work within the democratic process for real reform.
[1:10:08.340 --> 1:10:16.460]  You can go to my plan, rogerstonesplannedosaveamerica.com, rogerstonesplannedosaveamerica.com.
[1:10:16.460 --> 1:10:18.180]  We'll send you a copy of the plan.
[1:10:18.180 --> 1:10:20.260]  There's a brief video there.
[1:10:20.260 --> 1:10:22.460]  Nowhere do we advocate violence.
[1:10:22.460 --> 1:10:28.540]  I have spent 40 years in the vineyards of the democratic system working on elections.
[1:10:28.540 --> 1:10:32.340]  That's right, roger, aren't they doing this because they know they're losing, even though
[1:10:32.340 --> 1:10:35.220]  they're trying to flusk with illegal aliens and trying to collapse the country and trying
[1:10:35.220 --> 1:10:36.940]  to clout and piven us.
[1:10:36.940 --> 1:10:39.820]  Humanity and America and people of all race, colors and creeds are coming together and
[1:10:39.820 --> 1:10:44.780]  realizing the democratic party are a group of miscreant, crazy people.
[1:10:44.780 --> 1:10:50.660]  Well, or alternatively, they now have the power, the power that Donald Trump had for
[1:10:50.660 --> 1:10:57.780]  four years, and they intend to use it to make fundamental changes in our political system
[1:10:57.780 --> 1:11:01.180]  and particularly in the makeup of the electorate.
[1:11:01.180 --> 1:11:03.780]  That's what Bill H.R.1 is all about.
[1:11:03.780 --> 1:11:04.780]  That's right.
[1:11:04.780 --> 1:11:05.780]  They're making their move on us now.
[1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:08.260]  Roger Stone, thank you so much and God bless.
[1:11:08.260 --> 1:11:12.580]  And don't forget, our big sponsor is mypillow.com with promo code alex up to 66% off and you
[1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:13.780]  can support roger.
[1:11:13.780 --> 1:11:16.340]  Go there, get big discounts as well with promo code stone.
[1:11:16.340 --> 1:11:17.340]  All right.
[1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:20.580]  Here's a key report on how you've all been declared terrorist.
[1:11:20.580 --> 1:11:27.100]  They should be treated as they're a bunch of thugs, insurrectionists, white supremacists,
[1:11:27.100 --> 1:11:30.100]  anti-Semites, six N is not enough.
[1:11:30.100 --> 1:11:36.700]  I mean, come on, you know, these shirts they're wearing, these are a bunch of thugs, thugs,
[1:11:36.700 --> 1:11:39.700]  and they're terrorist, domestic terrorists.
[1:11:39.700 --> 1:11:45.940]  In the FBI's view, the top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically
[1:11:45.940 --> 1:11:51.540]  motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocated for the superiority of
[1:11:51.540 --> 1:11:52.540]  the white race.
[1:11:52.540 --> 1:11:57.220]  The thing they want to do is to better share and coordinate all the vast trove of data
[1:11:57.220 --> 1:12:01.900]  they already collect on Americans because let's not forget DHS includes the Transportation
[1:12:01.900 --> 1:12:05.460]  Security Administration, ICE, Customs and Border Protection.
[1:12:05.460 --> 1:12:09.900]  So every time people travel, they encounter DHS and there's a lot of travel information,
[1:12:09.900 --> 1:12:13.820]  another information that they already have, they want to do a better job of analyzing
[1:12:13.820 --> 1:12:15.820]  it to hunt for domestic terrorists.
[1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:23.500]  We can declare al-Qaeda or ISIS, foreign terror groups and, you know, take investigative
[1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:27.940]  action against them because they have no First Amendment rights, they're not in the US.
[1:12:27.940 --> 1:12:33.820]  We can't do that with the 3%ers or the Proud Boys or the Boogaloo Boys and that's the challenge
[1:12:33.820 --> 1:12:34.820]  for the government.
[1:12:34.820 --> 1:12:41.300]  Now, let's go ahead and put on screen for everybody something that came from an NBC
[1:12:41.300 --> 1:12:48.020]  News program on NBC National, people were pretty shocked because it is an extremely authoritarian
[1:12:48.020 --> 1:12:49.780]  statement.
[1:12:49.780 --> 1:12:57.180]  Potential terror threats, opposition to COVID measures, claims of election fraud, belief
[1:12:57.180 --> 1:13:03.300]  Trump can be reinstated, 9-11 anniversary and religious holidays.
[1:13:03.300 --> 1:13:07.860]  Now, where is there evidence that people that want to reinstate Trump or question the election
[1:13:07.860 --> 1:13:10.500]  are going to blow stuff up?
[1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:16.260]  And where is there evidence that people protesting masks that don't work and experimental vaccines
[1:13:16.260 --> 1:13:18.300]  that don't work and make people sick?
[1:13:18.300 --> 1:13:23.300]  Where is there evidence that we're terrorists, much less that we're the number one terror
[1:13:23.300 --> 1:13:24.820]  threat?
[1:13:24.820 --> 1:13:31.020]  I learned about it two months ago when they issued the new official policy of the Biden
[1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:37.220]  administration, the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, but that's really
[1:13:37.220 --> 1:13:41.620]  what they're doing is conducting terrorism against us with the Chinese bio-weapon that
[1:13:41.620 --> 1:13:45.140]  their controllers released to take control of the United States.
[1:13:45.140 --> 1:13:50.740]  So let's see, the average person online thinks it's voodoo to know anything.
[1:13:50.740 --> 1:13:59.860]  So they thought I must have magically just thought this up on my own or I'm in the CIA
[1:13:59.860 --> 1:14:02.140]  as if people in the CIA know anything.
[1:14:02.140 --> 1:14:04.740]  That's a low-level criminal organization.
[1:14:04.740 --> 1:14:11.100]  So here it is, opposition to COVID measures is terrorism.
[1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:13.980]  Claims of election fraud is terrorism.
[1:14:13.980 --> 1:14:16.100]  Belief that Trump can be reinstated is terrorism.
[1:14:16.100 --> 1:14:22.300]  As soon as Biden got his way in through fraud in January of this year, now six and a half
[1:14:22.300 --> 1:14:28.980]  months ago, the first press conferences they had with General Milley and with Jen Psaki
[1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:35.940]  and with all these people and the Justice Department was protesting the election is
[1:14:35.940 --> 1:14:36.940]  terror.
[1:14:36.940 --> 1:14:41.380]  And then on page 10 of the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism came out
[1:14:41.380 --> 1:14:44.900]  two months ago, they made an official policy.
[1:14:44.900 --> 1:14:50.780]  They said any narratives of fraud in the recent general election, the emboldening impact of
[1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:56.700]  the violent breach of the U.S. Capitol, conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and conspiracy
[1:14:56.700 --> 1:15:03.820]  theories promoting violence will almost certainly spur some one to try to engage in violence.
[1:15:03.820 --> 1:15:07.780]  So who tried to engage in violence last year and this year?
[1:15:07.780 --> 1:15:12.900]  They claim things only got serious when the informants planted by the FBI got involved.
[1:15:12.900 --> 1:15:18.500]  The defense also portrayed online posts involving violent rhetoric about the governor as satire
[1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:23.300]  and their activities only escalating once an FBI confidential informant got involved.
[1:15:23.300 --> 1:15:27.980]  He told his group he wants Governor Whitmer's head on a platter.
[1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:33.100]  And that could be satire as well.
[1:15:33.100 --> 1:15:34.740]  I guess I don't think that's funny.
[1:15:34.740 --> 1:15:44.500]  I feel like I haven't you heard similar things about President Trump on late night TV.
[1:15:44.500 --> 1:15:51.500]  There's one plot to kidnap a governor because of the lockdown and that was the FBI creating
[1:15:51.500 --> 1:15:52.780]  the whole thing.
[1:15:52.780 --> 1:15:56.940]  And so just remember that's who they're hiring, that's who they're preparing for total war
[1:15:56.940 --> 1:16:00.060]  with us, ladies and gentlemen, and the entire leadership of the group.

[1:17:13.420 --> 1:17:17.740]  And now, to get around Big Tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:17:17.740 --> 1:17:18.740]  we've got.

[1:18:00.260 --> 1:18:04.620]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers
[1:18:04.620 --> 1:18:08.660]  controlled by Big Tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do.
[1:18:08.660 --> 1:18:12.620]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate,
[1:18:12.620 --> 1:18:17.260]  I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[1:18:17.260 --> 1:18:22.420]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket
[1:18:22.420 --> 1:18:24.300]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:24.300 --> 1:18:28.580]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated, they fit almost all types of androids

[1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:47.500]  them and I want you to buy friends and family of these systems to educate them about what
[1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:49.260]  these quote smartphones really are.
[1:18:49.260 --> 1:18:52.300]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[1:18:52.300 --> 1:18:55.220]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're
[1:18:55.220 --> 1:18:57.540]  not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[1:18:57.540 --> 1:19:01.660]  They're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:01.660 --> 1:19:08.860]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on and that it's
[1:19:08.860 --> 1:19:13.740]  criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public, they do the same
[1:19:13.740 --> 1:19:19.180]  things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and
[1:19:19.180 --> 1:19:20.180]  over again.
[1:19:20.180 --> 1:19:21.820]  Well, guess what?
[1:19:21.820 --> 1:19:29.740]  It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenesis Globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment
[1:19:29.740 --> 1:19:33.900]  of it with ACT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were
[1:19:33.900 --> 1:19:39.340]  the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the T1 besides
[1:19:39.340 --> 1:19:42.500]  the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[1:19:42.500 --> 1:19:47.860]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[1:19:47.860 --> 1:19:48.860]  the road.
[1:19:48.860 --> 1:19:52.940]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the
[1:19:52.940 --> 1:19:58.260]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[1:19:58.260 --> 1:20:03.500]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:03.500 --> 1:20:15.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:15.060 --> 1:20:19.500]  Remember that great 1990s movie or whenever it came out, Mars Attacks?
[1:20:19.500 --> 1:20:20.500]  The comedy.
[1:20:20.500 --> 1:20:24.140]  But when the aliens are running around with their ray guns killing everybody across the
[1:20:24.140 --> 1:20:28.820]  world, they say, don't run, we are your friends and then you stop and they kill you and they
[1:20:28.820 --> 1:20:32.500]  laugh about it because it always just keeps working.
[1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:36.300]  Well, we actually have a Mars Attacks level clip.
[1:20:36.300 --> 1:20:37.300]  This just came in.
[1:20:37.300 --> 1:20:38.300]  It's on infowars.com.
[1:20:38.300 --> 1:20:40.500]  It's a Jamie White article.
[1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:48.980]  Hajiab Klad CNN reporter praises friendly Taliban chaining death to America.
[1:20:48.980 --> 1:20:55.220]  So we've just topped mostly peaceful protest with an eight-story building on fire behind
[1:20:55.220 --> 1:21:02.420]  it and other, it looks like Armageddon, looks like End of the World, mostly peaceful.
[1:21:02.420 --> 1:21:07.780]  And in the article, Jamie White points out that earlier this year, Babylon B, the great
[1:21:07.780 --> 1:21:18.820]  satire site, ran a satire piece where it says CNN praises Taliban for wearing masks during
[1:21:18.820 --> 1:21:19.820]  attack.
[1:21:19.820 --> 1:21:22.740]  You know, it's saying it's for the lockdown.
[1:21:22.740 --> 1:21:23.740]  It's for COVID.
[1:21:23.740 --> 1:21:24.740]  Look at this right here.
[1:21:24.740 --> 1:21:30.740]  So this is just absolute gold, except it's real.
[1:21:30.740 --> 1:21:36.260]  That is the total incompetence, the absolute complete takeover of society.
[1:21:36.260 --> 1:21:42.460]  Maybe we can just show you the actual article itself, but the article is up on infowars.com.
[1:21:42.460 --> 1:21:45.460]  I hope you'll share it.
[1:21:45.460 --> 1:21:51.460]  But here is the Hajiab wearing woman, the CNN reporter.
[1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:57.500]  Hell, she's less covered than we are in America now.
[1:21:57.500 --> 1:21:59.220]  The Muslims more free than us.
[1:21:59.220 --> 1:22:05.660]  Hajiab Klad reporter praises friendly Taliban chaining death to America.
[1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:09.540]  Then let's scroll down for TV viewers, radio listeners will read the article at infowars.com.
[1:22:09.540 --> 1:22:14.740]  In an unbelievable clip, only CNN could pull off a reporter wearing a hijab in Afghanistan
[1:22:14.740 --> 1:22:20.020]  praises the Taliban for being friendly while chanting death to America, she actually says
[1:22:20.020 --> 1:22:21.020]  it.
[1:22:21.020 --> 1:22:22.020]  The clip's not even edited.
[1:22:22.020 --> 1:22:24.820]  I'm sorry, this is getting too good.
[1:22:24.820 --> 1:22:30.820]  CNN's chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward, clad in a hijab, mingled with the Taliban
[1:22:30.820 --> 1:22:35.820]  during their takeover Afghanistan and the signature anti-American style CNN is known
[1:22:35.820 --> 1:22:36.820]  for.
[1:22:36.820 --> 1:22:39.900]  Remember they supported the whole Arab Spring taking over and killing millions.
[1:22:39.900 --> 1:22:44.300]  They're just chanting, they're just chanting death to America, but they seem friendly
[1:22:44.300 --> 1:22:45.940]  at the same time.
[1:22:45.940 --> 1:22:51.380]  Ward told the audience Monday, it's utterly bizarre.
[1:22:51.380 --> 1:22:57.340]  All of this is bizarre because leftists are chameleons and they have Stockholm syndrome.
[1:22:57.340 --> 1:23:02.940]  They just adopt whatever, as long as it's not Christian, as long as it's not successful,
[1:23:02.940 --> 1:23:07.820]  see because they're threatened by American power, they're threatened by Western prowess
[1:23:07.820 --> 1:23:12.420]  and it's a bunch of weird social engineer white people that look at the world being
[1:23:12.420 --> 1:23:17.420]  90% brown and say, let's organize them and bring them in and take over.
[1:23:17.420 --> 1:23:22.820]  You take over by writing a great book or being a great football player or being a great musician
[1:23:22.820 --> 1:23:27.460]  or cooking great food or being a loving person, but you're not creepy weirdo that works at
[1:23:27.460 --> 1:23:34.500]  CNN that wants to lie to people while galaxy aircraft fly above and people falling off
[1:23:34.500 --> 1:23:35.500]  the engines.
[1:23:35.500 --> 1:23:40.540]  I mean, this is what you build, it's what you do, you're a monsters.
[1:23:40.540 --> 1:23:43.740]  I saw the most unintentional comedy over the weekend and I meant to get it.
[1:23:43.740 --> 1:23:48.980]  I didn't know last week that Brian Skelter had gone on Stephen Colbert and I watched
[1:23:48.980 --> 1:23:53.740]  the whole 14 minute interview while Colbert grovels to him and while Skelter describes
[1:23:53.740 --> 1:24:00.940]  how he controls reality and they decide what can be on TV, I mean, it is just like, like
[1:24:00.940 --> 1:24:06.900]  worshiping and exalting a bucket of vomit or something.
[1:24:06.900 --> 1:24:11.780]  It's just, but again, it's this ruling class that stole the power that are in control that
[1:24:11.780 --> 1:24:20.780]  just hate themselves and are basically in a fever dream going out for society.
[1:24:20.780 --> 1:24:25.180]  And so instead of replacing Skelter with somebody better, they prop him up just like Hillary.
[1:24:25.180 --> 1:24:33.020]  They never stop propping up their gods, their ugly little gods.
[1:24:33.020 --> 1:24:38.140]  So sorry, here is the CNN clip and in case you miss it, let's just run it three or four
[1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:39.140]  times back to back.
[1:24:39.140 --> 1:24:40.300]  This is unedited.
[1:24:40.300 --> 1:24:41.400]  She said this back to back.
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:42.400]  This is real.
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:43.400]  Here it is.
[1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:48.500]  They're just chanting death to America, but they seem friendly at the same time.
[1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:50.340]  It's utterly bizarre.
[1:24:50.340 --> 1:24:55.500]  At the president, they're just chanting death to America, but they seem friendly at the
[1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:56.500]  same time.
[1:24:56.500 --> 1:24:58.300]  It's utterly bizarre.
[1:24:58.300 --> 1:25:03.460]  At the president, they're just chanting death to America, but they seem friendly at the
[1:25:03.460 --> 1:25:04.460]  same time.
[1:25:04.460 --> 1:25:06.220]  It's utterly bizarre.
[1:25:06.220 --> 1:25:11.420]  At the president, they're just chanting death to America, but they seem friendly at the
[1:25:11.420 --> 1:25:12.420]  same time.
[1:25:12.420 --> 1:25:14.180]  It's utterly bizarre.
[1:25:14.180 --> 1:25:16.580]  At the president, it's utterly bizarre.
[1:25:16.580 --> 1:25:22.060]  All right, let's let's let's move on before I give the number not take your calls.
[1:25:22.060 --> 1:25:26.060]  This is Jimmy Fallon and people, people are in the news saying, you know, it doesn't make
[1:25:26.060 --> 1:25:32.420]  sense, he weirdly celebrates the end of white people while everyone tries to get into countries
[1:25:32.420 --> 1:25:37.580]  that white people designed.
[1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:43.820]  White people are the worst thing the world's ever seen, but you know, the medicine and
[1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:49.060]  the science and the literature and the architecture and all of it, except there is the bad side.
[1:25:49.060 --> 1:25:53.060]  There's a cloth swab side of white people, which is actually trying to destroy what was
[1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:57.060]  good about Western civilization and bring in tyranny because he wants to just rule over
[1:25:57.060 --> 1:25:58.540]  everybody.
[1:25:58.540 --> 1:26:03.860]  But imagine, hey, open the borders up, bring everybody in, everybody's going to kumbaya,
[1:26:03.860 --> 1:26:07.980]  the Democrats teach people coming into hate America to hate white people.
[1:26:07.980 --> 1:26:12.260]  And then you've got the nice little white leader, Jimmy Fallon up there on his national
[1:26:12.260 --> 1:26:17.780]  show with the applause sign, there's video going on saying applaud the end of white people
[1:26:17.780 --> 1:26:23.220]  like it's the end of syphilis or the end of gonorrhea or the end of herpes.
[1:26:23.220 --> 1:26:29.060]  I mean, imagine him saying, yay, we've almost gotten rid of all the black people.
[1:26:29.060 --> 1:26:33.780]  This is on national television, but this is what's taught the colleges, this is what's
[1:26:33.780 --> 1:26:37.180]  taught the media, this is them externalizing this.
[1:26:37.180 --> 1:26:40.940]  The Washington Post had a big headline about, thank God the whites are a minority, there's
[1:26:40.940 --> 1:26:44.940]  a white woman writing it, but she goes, but we can't allow white minority rule.
[1:26:44.940 --> 1:26:48.980]  That means white people can't have anything except for Jeff Bezos and the millionaires
[1:26:48.980 --> 1:26:49.980]  offshore.
[1:26:49.980 --> 1:26:50.980]  They can have everything.
[1:26:50.980 --> 1:26:54.820]  They're the ones funding class warfare because they're worried about the idea of western
[1:26:54.820 --> 1:26:59.580]  civilization wanting property, wanting a second amendment, wanting a middle class.
[1:26:59.580 --> 1:27:02.500]  So they're saying, oh, the middle class is white.
[1:27:02.500 --> 1:27:08.260]  Get rid of that thing called the middle class, see?
[1:27:08.260 --> 1:27:12.180]  So they're saying American values, what people come here to get, they're saying, well, that's
[1:27:12.180 --> 1:27:13.180]  white.
[1:27:13.180 --> 1:27:16.700]  And I guess it did come out of Magna Carta and it did come out of the Anglo-Saxon tradition.
[1:27:16.700 --> 1:27:17.700]  So I mean, it's true.
[1:27:17.700 --> 1:27:22.580]  So it's like, oh, well, I mean, if medicine and cars and electricity is white, I want
[1:27:22.580 --> 1:27:23.580]  to get rid of it.
[1:27:23.580 --> 1:27:27.460]  Klaus Schwab goes, exactly, you are post-industrial, you die.
[1:27:27.460 --> 1:27:30.780]  But see, everybody still wants to get here.
[1:27:30.780 --> 1:27:31.780]  It's unbelievable.
[1:27:31.780 --> 1:27:37.260]  So it's the elite class waging war on the underclass with racial division, which will
[1:27:37.260 --> 1:27:38.260]  destroy society.
[1:27:38.260 --> 1:27:42.420]  This is the opposite of what Christ taught, the opposite of what Martin Luther King taught,
[1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:47.820]  here, all the common sense stuff, just completely out the window, the most racist vile stuff
[1:27:47.820 --> 1:27:48.820]  ever.
[1:27:48.820 --> 1:27:51.140]  But it's on the nightly comedy show, so it's OK.
[1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:52.140]  But it's not comedy.
[1:27:52.140 --> 1:27:53.140]  It's their actual mission.
[1:27:53.140 --> 1:27:54.140]  Here it is.
[1:27:54.140 --> 1:27:59.220]  The results of the 2020 census just came out, and for the first time in American history,
[1:27:59.220 --> 1:28:04.140]  the number of white people went down.
[1:28:04.140 --> 1:28:08.420]  Here's the results of the 2020 census just came out, and for the first time in American
[1:28:08.420 --> 1:28:11.900]  history, the number of white people went down.
[1:28:11.900 --> 1:28:12.900]  Yeah.
[1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:20.700]  Of course, the truth is, around half the abortions in this country are black babies, and blacks
[1:28:20.700 --> 1:28:22.100]  are 13 percent of the population.
[1:28:22.100 --> 1:28:25.620]  So they're really, Margaret Sanger said, we've got to get the blacks or some human.
[1:28:25.620 --> 1:28:27.020]  Now that's her saying it.
[1:28:27.020 --> 1:28:28.020]  She's liberal.
[1:28:28.020 --> 1:28:29.020]  I get it.
[1:28:29.020 --> 1:28:30.020]  It's like, George Sorrell is like, I love Hitler.
[1:28:30.020 --> 1:28:31.020]  I love killing people.
[1:28:31.020 --> 1:28:37.100]  It was the best time of my life, rounding up Jews, and the ADL is like, but if you actually
[1:28:37.100 --> 1:28:38.780]  oppose Hitler, they come after you.
[1:28:38.780 --> 1:28:41.940]  Schwarzenegger sold Rolling Stone, he loved Hitler.
[1:28:41.940 --> 1:28:43.100]  So the ADL gives him awards.
[1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:44.580]  You see, you figure this out yet?
[1:28:44.580 --> 1:28:49.620]  Because the ADLs run by the same folks whose grandfathers made Jews pay the equivalent of
[1:28:49.620 --> 1:28:52.700]  trillions of dollars to get out of Germany.
[1:28:52.700 --> 1:28:55.780]  That's who the ADL is, is the folks that sold the Jews out to Hitler.
[1:28:55.780 --> 1:28:56.780]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:56.780 --> 1:28:59.380]  Stay with us.
[1:28:59.380 --> 1:29:04.500]  Attention radio listeners, if you're concerned about the coming chaos after the November
[1:29:04.500 --> 1:29:07.780]  elections, this will be an extremely important message.
[1:29:07.780 --> 1:29:08.780]  Here's why.
[1:29:08.780 --> 1:29:15.540]  No matter what the outcome in November, catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility.
[1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:16.780]  Here's why this is important.
[1:29:16.780 --> 1:29:21.660]  Listen, we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain
[1:29:21.660 --> 1:29:25.460]  waves of social chaos and unstable currencies.
[1:29:25.460 --> 1:29:30.140]  But did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship
[1:29:30.140 --> 1:29:34.580]  when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold?
[1:29:34.580 --> 1:29:39.460]  It's true, open pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store
[1:29:39.460 --> 1:29:42.020]  of value in the coming hard times ahead.
[1:29:42.020 --> 1:29:46.140]  Go to survivalseedbank.com to get heirloom seeds below wholesale.

[1:29:59.220 --> 1:30:05.260]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[1:30:05.260 --> 1:30:07.620]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:30:07.620 --> 1:30:12.220]  I was barely holding onto a jaw and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[1:30:12.220 --> 1:30:16.780]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[1:30:16.780 --> 1:30:19.860]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that too, you had, you know, with a deep
[1:30:19.860 --> 1:30:22.060]  burden source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[1:30:22.060 --> 1:30:23.060]  So I took it.
[1:30:23.060 --> 1:30:29.020]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened
[1:30:29.020 --> 1:30:32.380]  and you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[1:30:32.380 --> 1:30:36.820]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[1:30:36.820 --> 1:30:38.940]  take basically all of your supplements.
[1:30:38.940 --> 1:30:40.860]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:30:40.860 --> 1:30:45.260]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[1:30:45.260 --> 1:30:46.260]  It's amazing.
[1:30:46.260 --> 1:30:47.260]  It works.
[1:30:47.260 --> 1:30:50.420]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[1:30:50.420 --> 1:30:51.420]  the globalist system.
[1:30:51.420 --> 1:30:55.220]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:30:55.220 --> 1:30:59.100]  Beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:31:56.180 --> 1:32:03.780]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six
[1:32:03.780 --> 1:32:07.500]  plus months of where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash?
[1:32:07.500 --> 1:32:11.420]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a best seller within six months
[1:32:11.420 --> 1:32:15.420]  and now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain, we haven't
[1:32:15.420 --> 1:32:16.420]  had it.
[1:32:16.420 --> 1:32:21.100]  Finally, it came back in a limited supply, believe me, I'm happy to, it's a great toothpaste
[1:32:21.100 --> 1:32:24.220]  and it funds the info or so if you want to get it and stock up on it because you were
[1:32:24.220 --> 1:32:29.540]  already a fan or if you haven't tried it, it's back in stock at infowarstore.com discounted
[1:32:29.540 --> 1:32:34.900]  because of the COVID lockdown, because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies
[1:32:34.900 --> 1:32:35.900]  in America.
[1:32:35.900 --> 1:32:39.700]  It's not been available for over six months, but now it's back in stock and it's available
[1:32:39.700 --> 1:32:46.380]  at only two places, infowarstore.com and Dr. Jones naturals.com.
[1:32:46.380 --> 1:32:49.780]  It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.
[1:32:49.780 --> 1:32:53.620]  So get your activated charcoal toothpaste, activated charcoal mouthwash with essential
[1:32:53.620 --> 1:33:03.420]  oils and more at infowarstore.com and fund the info war a true 360 win.
[1:33:03.420 --> 1:33:25.380]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:25.380 --> 1:33:29.500]  We got a doctor on the last 30 minutes of the next hour who says they tried to kill
[1:33:29.500 --> 1:33:30.500]  him in the hospital.
[1:33:30.500 --> 1:33:36.020]  He had a very prominent person set to come on, they were trying to kill her dad and they
[1:33:36.020 --> 1:33:37.020]  did kill him.
[1:33:37.020 --> 1:33:38.020]  That's what you can't come on right now.
[1:33:38.020 --> 1:33:39.020]  In a few days, she may be ready.
[1:33:39.020 --> 1:33:41.020]  So he said, oh, just talk to this other doctor.
[1:33:41.020 --> 1:33:43.020]  It was in the same hospital they were trying to kill.
[1:33:43.020 --> 1:33:47.100]  And if you think we're just exaggerating about that, this is really going on.
[1:33:47.100 --> 1:33:48.460]  So that's coming up.
[1:33:48.460 --> 1:33:52.060]  I want to give the number out specifically on Afghanistan.
[1:33:52.060 --> 1:33:55.540]  I want to hear from Afghanistan vets, particularly.
[1:33:55.540 --> 1:34:00.420]  So please don't call if you're not an Afghanistan vet or if you've worked over there as a contractor
[1:34:00.420 --> 1:34:04.940]  I would like to get your quick takes you don't have to hold on where you see this going.
[1:34:04.940 --> 1:34:08.940]  If you disagree with me that obviously Biden didn't do this and it's fun to say he's an
[1:34:08.940 --> 1:34:11.860]  app because he is but they knew exactly what was happening.
[1:34:11.860 --> 1:34:12.860]  They gave him briefings.
[1:34:12.860 --> 1:34:18.660]  What was going to go on and this has been done to basically discredit peace and being
[1:34:18.660 --> 1:34:27.140]  able to pull out another way using air power so that we could have a pull out that wouldn't
[1:34:27.140 --> 1:34:29.060]  be as is embarrassing.
[1:34:29.060 --> 1:34:30.820]  The whole thing was wrong to begin with.
[1:34:30.820 --> 1:34:37.900]  You can't go to Stone Age cave people and get them to accept your leftist Star Trek
[1:34:37.900 --> 1:34:41.180]  vision of the world.
[1:34:41.180 --> 1:34:48.660]  So we've got all that information to lay out, but I want to explain something.
[1:34:48.660 --> 1:34:52.180]  When I get up here and I say the goal is to collapse civilization.
[1:34:52.180 --> 1:34:54.700]  The goal is to break the social contract.
[1:34:54.700 --> 1:34:58.140]  The goal is to bankrupt the social safety net.
[1:34:58.140 --> 1:35:03.740]  All I do is read what Cloward and Piven wrote in the sixties that was adopted as policy
[1:35:03.740 --> 1:35:06.460]  by the Democrats by the seventies.
[1:35:06.460 --> 1:35:07.460]  All I do is read Claude Schwab.
[1:35:07.460 --> 1:35:09.140]  It's all like I'm real smart.
[1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:12.740]  I read these people run stuff, folks.
[1:35:12.740 --> 1:35:21.220]  What they write down they do it'd be like if I found a piece of paper on the ground
[1:35:21.220 --> 1:35:24.300]  and it was a neighbor planning to kill his neighbor that you know next week.
[1:35:24.300 --> 1:35:25.420]  Maybe you think it's a joke.
[1:35:25.420 --> 1:35:26.420]  Maybe you don't say anything.
[1:35:26.420 --> 1:35:30.540]  If you feel weird and then the next week the neighbor gets killed, then you're like, whoa,
[1:35:30.540 --> 1:35:31.540]  I better call the police.
[1:35:31.540 --> 1:35:32.540]  He was serious.
[1:35:32.540 --> 1:35:37.100]  I've been watching them write these books and give these speeches for 30 years and I've
[1:35:37.100 --> 1:35:41.140]  watched them basically do everything they said they do and more.
[1:35:41.140 --> 1:35:47.980]  So unbelievable.
[1:35:47.980 --> 1:35:52.140]  And look, as much as I'm covering Afghanistan, I'm going to have to come up here tonight
[1:35:52.140 --> 1:35:56.740]  to a special report or I'm going to have to just not take calls tomorrow and not have
[1:35:56.740 --> 1:36:00.100]  guests tomorrow because I got to really get you to wrap your mind around this.
[1:36:00.100 --> 1:36:01.540]  I've wrapped my brain around it real hard.
[1:36:01.540 --> 1:36:02.740]  I'm pretty sure I'm dead on.
[1:36:02.740 --> 1:36:04.740]  I mean, I'm right about 95% of it.
[1:36:04.740 --> 1:36:08.980]  I'm not sure it'll last 5%, but let me just say something.
[1:36:08.980 --> 1:36:14.500]  I go off real numbers and real facts and real people and COVID-19 last year was made up
[1:36:14.500 --> 1:36:15.740]  crap.
[1:36:15.740 --> 1:36:19.740]  The virus was real so they could own it and have a vaccine again that when you make a
[1:36:19.740 --> 1:36:25.660]  vaccine for that virus, it creates a deadly poison.
[1:36:25.660 --> 1:36:27.500]  They studied it massively.
[1:36:27.500 --> 1:36:29.260]  They take congressional hearings on it.
[1:36:29.260 --> 1:36:31.540]  That's why all the top scientists up front said, don't do this.
[1:36:31.540 --> 1:36:34.540]  This is crazy because it's a known thing.
[1:36:34.540 --> 1:36:40.500]  They did a known poison, but they could call it a vaccine so these people who are trusting
[1:36:40.500 --> 1:36:41.860]  went out and followed it.
[1:36:41.860 --> 1:36:44.620]  But let me tell you something.
[1:36:44.620 --> 1:36:48.460]  When I say half of them for wars has COVID, that's conservative.
[1:36:48.460 --> 1:36:54.980]  When I say half of my parents' friends and my parents and my wife and the nanny, and
[1:36:54.980 --> 1:36:58.820]  she went and visited family in the Midwest, half of them are sick, and then everybody
[1:36:58.820 --> 1:37:05.700]  they know is sick, and then I had a film crew here from Utah and a film crew from California,
[1:37:05.700 --> 1:37:09.060]  and they said half their people were sick, and then they were telling me all the stories
[1:37:09.060 --> 1:37:18.420]  about, yeah, my aunt and my uncle, this guy is pretty young, both took the Pfizer shot
[1:37:18.420 --> 1:37:24.660]  and both had detached retinas within two weeks of each other.
[1:37:24.660 --> 1:37:26.940]  And that's in the literature, it attacks your eyeballs.
[1:37:26.940 --> 1:37:31.060]  Like Roger Stone, heard from people very close to family that she got sick right after she
[1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:34.140]  took the shot and had all sorts of tumors pop up on her, and she went to the doctor
[1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:38.780]  and they said, yeah, this is cancer, write the lymph node under where she got the shot.
[1:37:38.780 --> 1:37:44.140]  I call Roger up, he tells me, and then says, but I'm not getting in my wife's business,
[1:37:44.140 --> 1:37:45.140]  don't talk about it.
[1:37:45.140 --> 1:37:50.620]  And I always keep confidence on everything else, as a journalist, as long as something
[1:37:50.620 --> 1:37:53.820]  isn't criminal, you tell me it, I'm going to keep confidence.
[1:37:53.820 --> 1:37:56.980]  But and I love Roger, he got pissed off today, by the way, on and off here, I'm going to
[1:37:56.980 --> 1:37:57.980]  leave it at that.
[1:37:57.980 --> 1:38:02.780]  But I said, hey, I'm breaking confidence right now, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.
[1:38:02.780 --> 1:38:08.060]  Which I rarely do because it's almost a crime not to tell people she took the Pfizer shot
[1:38:08.060 --> 1:38:11.060]  and got lymphatic cancer, what's in the literature, that's what it does.
[1:38:11.060 --> 1:38:15.900]  I mean, this is hitting everybody, folks, I apologize to Roger, but I did what I did
[1:38:15.900 --> 1:38:16.900]  consciously.
[1:38:16.900 --> 1:38:21.220]  And I'm sorry if he gets in trouble with his family.
[1:38:21.220 --> 1:38:28.340]  It's like the guy says, and dawn on the wind, he goes, frankly, my dear, I don't give a
[1:38:28.340 --> 1:38:29.340]  damn.
[1:38:29.340 --> 1:38:34.900]  I mean, I went to Central Market today, because my parents are both super sick with COVID,
[1:38:34.900 --> 1:38:37.500]  and I went in there to get them a bunch of food, they've been sick for a week, they wouldn't
[1:38:37.500 --> 1:38:38.500]  even tell me they were sick.
[1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:42.860]  So I went over there, they had no food left, and they're all just laying there like fish
[1:38:42.860 --> 1:38:51.100]  out of water, gulping for air, I gave them some steroid inhalers and stuff I got.
[1:38:51.100 --> 1:38:56.860]  And I was just thinking about Fauci and Bill Gates, you see, that's why they're saying
[1:38:56.860 --> 1:39:00.620]  anti-vaxxers are terrorists, because they're going to keep killing us with these shots
[1:39:00.620 --> 1:39:05.780]  and with the people shedding the shots, shedding the vaccine, shedding the virus, until we
[1:39:05.780 --> 1:39:06.780]  finally do something.
[1:39:06.780 --> 1:39:09.580]  And I'm not calling for violence, because they'll use that against us.
[1:39:09.580 --> 1:39:16.060]  I'm just saying, we're getting punched in the face over and over and over again.
[1:39:16.060 --> 1:39:21.380]  So I'm in Central Market, that's the H-E-B rip off of Whole Foods, I think it is better
[1:39:21.380 --> 1:39:26.660]  than Whole Foods if you ask me, even though I don't even like H-E-B, my grandmother dated
[1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:28.460]  the founder of it, a little horrible person.
[1:39:28.460 --> 1:39:35.900]  But the point is, is that, Baylor, but the point is, is that I just saw people throughout
[1:39:35.900 --> 1:39:40.580]  the store with little kids in double masks, I'd walk right over and I'd say, all sorts
[1:39:40.580 --> 1:39:44.900]  of new pneumonias and lung diseases are hitting kids, it never happened before, kids are dying
[1:39:44.900 --> 1:39:50.340]  from it, it's in the news and it's the mass causing it, please for your children's sake.
[1:39:50.340 --> 1:39:57.580]  And I talked to five groups of parents with children that were just full at like 8am this
[1:39:57.580 --> 1:40:03.540]  morning at Central Market, the checkout line when I was getting, you know, fruit and vegetables
[1:40:03.540 --> 1:40:13.180]  for my parents and one time the guy goes, I used to live by you on one oak, that was
[1:40:13.180 --> 1:40:22.900]  like 15 years ago, and another guy goes, hey, keep it to yourself, and another guy just
[1:40:22.900 --> 1:40:25.980]  looked at me and I said, do you love your children?
[1:40:25.980 --> 1:40:30.620]  I mean, I'm telling them facts here, those masks don't do a damn thing except give you
[1:40:30.620 --> 1:40:37.540]  bacterial pneumonia, and you'd think, you'd think that you'd stab these people talking
[1:40:37.540 --> 1:40:46.580]  to them, and the lady checking me out had two damn masks on, and then they take the
[1:40:46.580 --> 1:40:53.260]  shot and then they slough live spike protein on your ass, I mean, I've got a stack of studies
[1:40:53.260 --> 1:40:57.220]  on it, you think I'm just saying that because it feels good to say that, I mean, look at
[1:40:57.220 --> 1:41:04.060]  this stack right here, look at this, vaccines create variants, look at this, this is a small
[1:41:04.060 --> 1:41:09.220]  stack right here, okay, here's your precious AP, I even said this in the chat counter,
[1:41:09.220 --> 1:41:16.020]  I said, you know, almost all polio worldwide from the vaccine, and they started laughing
[1:41:16.020 --> 1:41:22.860]  at me, because you know, knowing how to read AP is like, kooky, more polio cases now caused
[1:41:22.860 --> 1:41:29.420]  by vaccine and by wild virus by shedding, all design like that, but see, when it first
[1:41:29.420 --> 1:41:36.780]  happened, Bill Gates would just call it, oh, another virus, it wasn't our shot, COVID-19
[1:41:36.780 --> 1:41:41.780]  vaccines could add fuel to evolution of coronavirus, NPR, it happened, UN says new polio outbreak
[1:41:41.780 --> 1:41:47.660]  in Sudan caused by oral vaccine, and it goes on, it lands its studies and all of it about
[1:41:47.660 --> 1:41:53.100]  SARS, COVID, the exact same type of virus that caused massive shedding, and it caused
[1:41:53.100 --> 1:41:57.740]  autoimmune responses and eating of the lungs, but they don't care, they will give their
[1:41:57.740 --> 1:42:03.940]  children the deadly shot as fast as they can, and if their children die, in fact, that was
[1:42:03.940 --> 1:42:08.780]  in my stack and I can't find it from yesterday, will you guys repool me, the clown world article,
[1:42:08.780 --> 1:42:17.700]  think of Don Salazar wrote it, maybe it was Kelly McBreen last Friday, where a woman in
[1:42:17.700 --> 1:42:22.780]  San Antonio got her mother and father to both take the Pfizer shot, they both died within
[1:42:22.780 --> 1:42:28.780]  a month of each other when they took it, first her mother took it and died, then the dad
[1:42:28.780 --> 1:42:32.620]  took it and died, and she said, well, he'd have died more painful, this made him die
[1:42:32.620 --> 1:42:39.300]  more comfortably, that's Stockholm syndrome, she can't admit that that happened to her
[1:42:39.300 --> 1:42:43.660]  family, that the vaccine killed her, and that's all over the news, like this guy got the vaccine,
[1:42:43.660 --> 1:42:47.660]  this person got the vaccine, then they die, they never caught the vaccine, they go, man,
[1:42:47.660 --> 1:42:52.900]  COVID still killed me, but I'm sure glad I got the vaccine, it made him kill me a lot
[1:42:52.900 --> 1:42:59.620]  less, stay with us, I'll give the number up.

[1:44:31.140 --> 1:44:35.180]  This is the Rockerfeller Foundation, they developed this whole plan with Bill Gates,
[1:44:35.180 --> 1:44:39.380]  they're now implementing it, and now they've announced that US policy is set by the private
[1:44:39.380 --> 1:44:43.740]  Rockerfeller Foundation, of course the Rockerfeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of
[1:44:43.740 --> 1:44:48.540]  Adolf, Alois Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor, the train the Coserville
[1:44:48.540 --> 1:44:52.860]  Home Institute in Germany, and info wars will continue to set fast, they fight this, I don't
[1:44:52.860 --> 1:44:57.420]  know how long we can, the enemy's coming for us all now, God bless, and good luck, I would
[1:44:57.420 --> 1:45:27.020]  begin your ride with God right now.
[1:45:27.020 --> 1:45:32.380]  Imagine just 20-30 years ago, tell just 5 years ago, if somebody told you this would
[1:45:32.380 --> 1:45:37.500]  be happening, but it is happening now, and then they tell you, oh sorry, it's not a
[1:45:37.500 --> 1:45:41.220]  vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work, so you've got to take it every
[1:45:41.220 --> 1:45:46.100]  few months, and the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time
[1:45:46.100 --> 1:45:50.380]  so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID,
[1:45:50.380 --> 1:45:54.220]  and now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding
[1:45:54.220 --> 1:45:59.060]  of the virus, and that's in mainline studies, Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go
[1:45:59.060 --> 1:46:02.060]  to prison for it right now.
[1:46:02.060 --> 1:46:06.820]  You say you want to fight tyranny, you say you want to fund the Second American Revolution,
[1:46:06.820 --> 1:46:10.940]  I know you do, that's why you're here, so I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening

[1:46:59.540 --> 1:47:03.020]  so much for your support.
[1:47:03.020 --> 1:47:24.660]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:24.660 --> 1:47:29.780]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:29.780 --> 1:47:36.660]  It's all clown world, all people in dress up, people in uniforms, women strutting around,
[1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:42.020]  with their commander in chief, the puppet installed by the globalists, lots of secret
[1:47:42.020 --> 1:47:47.100]  service with shaved heads and black sunglasses, acting powerful, everybody knows they're
[1:47:47.100 --> 1:47:52.500]  a joke, everybody knows America kills its unborn babies, and keeps them alive and sells
[1:47:52.500 --> 1:47:56.860]  their organs, and has convicted pedophiles, teach drag queen story time to them, everybody
[1:47:56.860 --> 1:48:02.180]  knows that we're a fallen republic, we have to admit it to ever get our country back.
[1:48:02.180 --> 1:48:07.860]  So he's set at 245 central, 345 eastern, it'll be Gerald Salente hosting them, but I'm sure
[1:48:07.860 --> 1:48:08.860]  he'll want to go to that.
[1:48:08.860 --> 1:48:12.780]  If not, we'll be covered in the warm today, 3pm central about what he's going to say about
[1:48:12.780 --> 1:48:18.900]  Afghanistan, but they're setting him up, they're manipulating him to have a failed country
[1:48:18.900 --> 1:48:26.340]  there to have a whole other invasion and a reset down the road, and to flood the US with
[1:48:26.340 --> 1:48:33.140]  their estimating 4 to 5 million Afghans, Europe tens of millions, it's just insane.
[1:48:33.140 --> 1:48:41.900]  And the 2.2 trillion, pumped into Afghanistan, made the capital city go from half a million
[1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:45.460]  to four and a half million they were saying, well where's all that food going to come from,
[1:48:45.460 --> 1:48:48.060]  where's it all the money going to come from, it's not going to be there, the Chinese are
[1:48:48.060 --> 1:48:52.140]  very cheap, and so are the Russians, and the Russians aren't planning to move back into
[1:48:52.140 --> 1:48:57.060]  that area, so this is going to be a disaster zone, they're talking about 30,000 the Defense
[1:48:57.060 --> 1:49:02.020]  Department's going to bring to the United States, it's a lot more than that.
[1:49:02.020 --> 1:49:09.860]  But look at this meme that of course Twitter's blocking, 200 days of Biden, border crisis,
[1:49:09.860 --> 1:49:15.060]  gas crisis, Middle East in crisis, Afghanistan in crisis, that's Central Asia, inflation
[1:49:15.060 --> 1:49:21.940]  crisis, and the mainstream corporate media everywhere saying white people are bad and
[1:49:21.940 --> 1:49:27.260]  are inherently evil, just what type of bizarro land is this, well here is Mayorkas, the
[1:49:27.260 --> 1:49:34.020]  DHS chief in the leaked video from this, leaked audio from this weekend, coming out and saying
[1:49:34.020 --> 1:49:41.420]  that this is unsustainable, tens of thousands a day turning themselves in, in one town in
[1:49:41.420 --> 1:49:46.340]  Texas alone, and when they have COVID they just drop them off at Water Burger, we broke
[1:49:46.340 --> 1:49:52.100]  that a month ago, months ago we went and showed you the level of this, and then now they just
[1:49:52.100 --> 1:49:57.100]  take them and dump them all over the US, but you need to wear a mask, and you need to not
[1:49:57.100 --> 1:50:02.940]  have your kids go to school, and you need to shut your business down, so Amazon and
[1:50:02.940 --> 1:50:07.900]  Walmart and Target can take over, so here's the head of DHS privately about what's happened.
[1:50:07.900 --> 1:50:14.780]  This is unsustainable, these numbers cannot continue, we cannot get to a point where we
[1:50:14.780 --> 1:50:19.260]  were a couple weeks ago, and we're going to make sure that doesn't happen, we're looking
[1:50:19.260 --> 1:50:24.420]  at the policy office, we can't continue like this, our people in the field can't continue
[1:50:24.420 --> 1:50:30.700]  and our system isn't built for it, I know very well, hearing from G-Pacys, G-40s and
[1:50:30.700 --> 1:50:36.300]  others, how close we came to breaking, how close you came to breaking here in this sector,
[1:50:36.300 --> 1:50:43.300]  and it's our responsibility to make sure that number happens again, we don't get that close
[1:50:43.300 --> 1:50:44.300]  again.
[1:50:44.300 --> 1:50:49.440]  Now the media spins that like, oh, he's a good guy, no, he's a globalist, and he's a
[1:50:49.440 --> 1:50:54.220]  metro-oraz, a Hispanic supremacist who they put in there as if it's helping Hispanics
[1:50:54.220 --> 1:50:58.900]  to do this to them, but it's all racial division, all racial control, the way a warden would
[1:50:58.900 --> 1:51:04.740]  control a prison, you've got each racial leader over their racial group, and they're saying
[1:51:04.740 --> 1:51:09.500]  because I said, board patrol, walk off, show people the millions, show them the collapse
[1:51:09.500 --> 1:51:12.940]  instead of you delivering them in buses and you taking them and spreading them all out
[1:51:12.940 --> 1:51:17.540]  and covering it up and loading them on unmarked airplanes, the little kidnapped kids, don't
[1:51:17.540 --> 1:51:22.540]  aid and abet the criminality, walk off the job, let the Democrats try to take these millions
[1:51:22.540 --> 1:51:26.020]  of people and say where they are, because they're all showing up as if they're supposed
[1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:33.020]  to be given a red carpet, and he said, oh, let's make sure this never happens again,
[1:51:33.020 --> 1:51:39.100]  let's beef it up, let's expand it, but let's not rush it so fast that it becomes obvious
[1:51:39.100 --> 1:51:41.100]  this is an invasion.
[1:51:41.100 --> 1:51:47.740]  All right, I want to give the number out for individuals that served in Afghanistan or
[1:51:47.740 --> 1:51:55.260]  Iraq for that matter, or in Syria, because clearly this is the program of Obama and the
[1:51:55.260 --> 1:52:02.180]  globalists for the Arab Spring, this is putting Taliban al-Qaeda in charge, this is letting
[1:52:02.180 --> 1:52:06.020]  them take the planet over and take over the soft underbelly of Europe to further break
[1:52:06.020 --> 1:52:07.020]  the borders.
[1:52:07.020 --> 1:52:09.820]  That's the plan, that's what Klaus Schwab and the UN are doing with their refugee
[1:52:09.820 --> 1:52:13.460]  migrant centers as a little Islamification of Europe.
[1:52:13.460 --> 1:52:19.620]  They are building a failed planet, they are making sure there are more failed states.
[1:52:19.620 --> 1:52:25.540]  They could have pulled out, bombed any of the Taliban trying to come in on the roads,
[1:52:25.540 --> 1:52:30.380]  but that wasn't done because the globalists want to embarrass Biden, they want to embarrass
[1:52:30.380 --> 1:52:38.140]  America, they want to make the country look like an absolute total joke so that China
[1:52:38.140 --> 1:52:44.260]  and others rise as the United States falls, because that's the global great reset.
[1:52:44.260 --> 1:52:46.900]  The end of the dollar, that's why they say China did a great job on COVID, we did a
[1:52:46.900 --> 1:52:55.300]  terrible job, because it's all about maneuvering us in the world to a collapsed position.
[1:52:55.300 --> 1:52:57.900]  But maybe you disagree with me, maybe you've got your take on it, I'd like to hear from
[1:52:57.900 --> 1:53:03.900]  you, first time callers that have served in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Syria on this whole
[1:53:03.900 --> 1:53:04.900]  nation.
[1:53:04.900 --> 1:53:08.140]  Maybe you've served in Africa, maybe you've watched the buildup of the Islamic groups
[1:53:08.140 --> 1:53:18.500]  there, I'd like to hear from you, 877-789-2539, 877-789, Alex, 877-789-2539, if you're outside
[1:53:18.500 --> 1:53:27.380]  the U.S. country code, 512-646-1776, again, 877-789-2539, we'll get you up and on the
[1:53:27.380 --> 1:53:28.380]  air.
[1:53:28.380 --> 1:53:32.020]  But I have no doubt that I'm right in the main about what I'm saying, but I'd like to
[1:53:32.020 --> 1:53:35.540]  hear if you think I'm wrong, or you've got things to add an expertise to this, but this
[1:53:35.540 --> 1:53:39.860]  is clearly a destabilization campaign, in fact, to a lot of smart people that have served
[1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:44.100]  in a lot of different levels of the government, that's their thought, where they give me their
[1:53:44.100 --> 1:53:49.180]  take is basically my take, before I've even told them what my take is.
[1:53:49.180 --> 1:53:53.140]  But it doesn't mean that Biden knows he's being set up, that's why he's so senile and
[1:53:53.140 --> 1:53:56.540]  so out of it, he'll take the blame while the globalists do this, see, that's why he's
[1:53:56.540 --> 1:53:57.540]  so dangerous.
[1:53:57.540 --> 1:54:01.380]  Oh, they commit all these crimes, they can flush him later, remember he even said during
[1:54:01.380 --> 1:54:05.340]  the campaign trial like a year ago, he said, well, if I ever do something that I'm not
[1:54:05.340 --> 1:54:10.340]  supposed to, I'll just paint an illness and resign, I'll do what I'm told.
[1:54:10.340 --> 1:54:13.700]  He's so senile, he's always like, am I allowed to do this, am I allowed to take questions,
[1:54:13.700 --> 1:54:17.420]  I'm going to get in trouble with my bosses, he's not joking, he's set on the campaign
[1:54:17.420 --> 1:54:21.980]  trial, I am servile, I'll do whatever I'm told.
[1:54:21.980 --> 1:54:26.380]  Folks, if you're a new listener, I'm not making this up, you can pull that up, that they found
[1:54:26.380 --> 1:54:28.900]  the article, but that's the video in it.
[1:54:28.900 --> 1:54:34.780]  I'll develop some disease and say I have to resign, as if he doesn't have a bunch of diseases.
[1:54:34.780 --> 1:54:40.460]  This is crazy, they said, we've got you, you're a Chinese spy, do what we say or it's over.
[1:54:40.460 --> 1:54:44.100]  And now it's his job to play Mario Kart while the world burns.
[1:54:44.100 --> 1:54:52.580]  Nero Fiddled is, Fiddled while Rome burned, Biden plays Mario Kart while it happens and
[1:54:52.580 --> 1:54:57.220]  to watch all the Twitter brigades try to defend him even to see it in turns on him is disgusting.
[1:54:57.220 --> 1:54:59.580]  Another big question is who are they going to replace Biden with and what's the timetable?
[1:54:59.580 --> 1:55:04.820]  Because you better believe he's not long for that administration.
[1:55:04.820 --> 1:55:11.100]  I can tell you with no uncertainty right now.
[1:55:11.100 --> 1:55:19.780]  Separately, this is the last full day, the sale is going to have to end tomorrow.
[1:55:19.780 --> 1:55:27.620]  It's up to 50% off all of these great best-selling products at infowarstore.com and the big one
[1:55:27.620 --> 1:55:33.180]  that I really want you to take advantage of is X2, deep earth crystal, highest quality
[1:55:33.180 --> 1:55:38.700]  iodine, it's really the missing link in so many people's health regimen in their life.
[1:55:38.700 --> 1:55:43.380]  If you don't know that you're deficient in iodine, you're not going to find out until
[1:55:43.380 --> 1:55:45.020]  you take X2.
[1:55:45.020 --> 1:55:49.820]  So deep earth crystals, it's not bound to anything else so you get the full download
[1:55:49.820 --> 1:55:53.100]  of it into your cells.
[1:55:53.100 --> 1:56:00.500]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, turbo force is 50% off and that shouldn't be in there
[1:56:00.500 --> 1:56:06.140]  because that actually sold out so that is incorrect but it's nobody's fault.
[1:56:06.140 --> 1:56:12.060]  I had a stack of articles in here and I just don't know how my main plug sheet got taken
[1:56:12.060 --> 1:56:15.260]  off the top because I laid it right over here.
[1:56:15.260 --> 1:56:18.300]  It's got a senile like Joe Biden.
[1:56:18.300 --> 1:56:20.500]  Actually what I'm really sick of is this earpiece.
[1:56:20.500 --> 1:56:23.780]  That's this high-tech HD earpiece and it's like a microchip.
[1:56:23.780 --> 1:56:30.620]  You basically put your ear and it just drives me crazy because the wire is always hopping
[1:56:30.620 --> 1:56:37.140]  out and if I don't have the wire in my ear, I can't get all my orders from the Russians.
[1:56:37.140 --> 1:56:38.140]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:56:38.140 --> 1:56:42.340]  All right, I'm being sarcastic, I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back and
[1:56:42.340 --> 1:56:46.060]  take your calls but just looking at Joe Biden makes me feel like I'm dying, makes me feel
[1:56:46.060 --> 1:56:47.060]  like I'm senile.
[1:56:47.060 --> 1:56:51.860]  Just to watch this fifth-generational warfare of discrediting us, of bankrupting us, of
[1:56:51.860 --> 1:56:55.340]  annihilating us is just too much but we're going to make it through this, we're going
[1:56:55.340 --> 1:57:01.500]  through a decant cycle, we forgot about God, we threw God to the side and so now all of
[1:57:01.500 --> 1:57:06.420]  this is unfolding and happening to us but this is the last day or day and a half or
[1:57:06.420 --> 1:57:13.820]  so to get survival shield, X2 and 50% off to get pure turmeric, liquid extract, 50% off.

[1:58:39.740 --> 1:58:45.260]  The sale runs for only one week, it is the Boost Your Bodies Natural Defenses Supercell
[1:58:45.260 --> 1:58:50.620]  and another part of the sale ending is the privacy pouches for your cell phone.
[1:58:50.620 --> 1:58:55.420]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight
[1:58:55.420 --> 1:59:00.300]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job and I heard
[1:59:00.300 --> 1:59:03.980]  Dr. Group on their show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original
[1:59:03.980 --> 1:59:08.380]  survival shield, the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[1:59:08.380 --> 1:59:11.900]  with that too, you know with a deep burdened source you know and I got really excited about
[1:59:11.900 --> 1:59:18.140]  that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain
[1:59:18.140 --> 1:59:23.020]  was enlightened, you know I could think again, I could connect with people again and over the
[1:59:23.020 --> 1:59:27.820]  course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically
[1:59:27.820 --> 1:59:32.300]  all of your supplements, they're all absolutely amazing supplements, the one I like recently
[1:59:32.300 --> 1:59:36.460]  is knockout, it literally like if you want to sleep just take it, it's amazing, it works
[1:59:36.460 --> 1:59:40.460]  but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[1:59:40.460 --> 1:59:45.180]  the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand.
[1:59:45.180 --> 1:59:53.500]  Beautifully said brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:00:15.500 --> 2:00:25.500]  All right we are now into hour number three
[2:00:28.460 --> 2:00:33.580]  and we are going to take your phone calls from Jacob and Nicholas and Edward and James and John
[2:00:33.580 --> 2:00:39.580]  and Ryan and Luke and John and Alex and many many others we're asking for soldiers,
[2:00:39.580 --> 2:00:49.580]  marines, airmen, GI Janes, all of you to call in and tell us your experience in Afghanistan
[2:00:49.580 --> 2:00:54.380]  and what you make of what's happening now and the incredible footage of people hanging off
[2:00:55.100 --> 2:01:03.660]  the landing gear of large transport jets galaxies as they fall to their deaths
[2:01:03.660 --> 2:01:10.220]  and Joe Biden says there is no crisis so let's go ahead and start with who's been holding the longest
[2:01:12.220 --> 2:01:17.020]  let's go to Alex and Michigan was in the army serving Afghanistan on Biden in the situation
[2:01:17.020 --> 2:01:23.740]  what do you make of what's happening? How you doing sir? Good talk to you thank I appreciate
[2:01:23.740 --> 2:01:28.380]  I'm actually very grateful I got through I'm not usually one to call but this is something
[2:01:28.380 --> 2:01:37.580]  near and dear to my heart I actually I was there in 2010 uh cab scout and I left work early just
[2:01:37.580 --> 2:01:43.740]  because I'm a proud man I'm not going to be seen not full on sobbing but tearing up I don't want
[2:01:43.740 --> 2:01:51.820]  to be seen like that at work this breaks my heart what breaks your heart watching those people so
[2:01:51.820 --> 2:01:59.980]  desperate as they know those Islamic enslavers are coming that but more than that for obviously I'm a
[2:01:59.980 --> 2:02:06.380]  proud patriot my brain keeps it won't shut up it keeps asking why I agree with you so let me ask
[2:02:06.380 --> 2:02:10.220]  you we're gonna move for a lot of calls here why do you think Biden did this because they knew this
[2:02:10.220 --> 2:02:21.420]  would happen for China there from what I understand there is a ton of minable resources very expensive
[2:02:21.420 --> 2:02:26.700]  lucrative resources rare minerals and they're always giving the rare earth minerals we're not
[2:02:26.700 --> 2:02:32.460]  even allowed to have them right they're always afghanistan's fighting within itself too much to
[2:02:32.460 --> 2:02:37.500]  ever actually start excavating those to bring the money into their country so china can walk in and
[2:02:37.500 --> 2:02:44.140]  take it look at all those folks trying to get to america to be enslaved by evil white men and if
[2:02:44.140 --> 2:02:49.260]  you're radio listeners people hanging off the uh jets insane god bless you alex i'm glad you called
[2:02:49.260 --> 2:02:53.980]  to give us your two cents we're gonna move quick to these calls let's talk to folks in pennsylvania
[2:02:53.980 --> 2:02:57.900]  let's talk to jeremy he was a marine on afghanistan situation give us your take
[2:02:59.500 --> 2:03:06.140]  hey alex how's it going uh it's pretty pretty sad actually how do you think it's going absolutely
[2:03:06.140 --> 2:03:11.020]  the same actually the exact same way i actually feel like this is uh psychological warfare against
[2:03:11.020 --> 2:03:15.100]  any veteran active duty and civilians who care about innocent people in afghanistan
[2:03:15.100 --> 2:03:18.460]  and they want us to retaliate they want the new january sixth of that to come out
[2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:26.860]  i agree flesh that out tell me more i mean they're just they're attacking our emotions right now
[2:03:26.860 --> 2:03:33.020]  and it's just i i i don't i've been crying over a decade i cried for a solid hour last night and i
[2:03:33.020 --> 2:03:39.580]  just couldn't it was it's i i can barely talk about it right now that's how i put so many friends
[2:03:39.580 --> 2:03:44.060]  in coffins in their caskets for their final flight home and this is how they get treated
[2:03:44.060 --> 2:03:50.060]  it's it's terrible it's haunting and by the way it's a fact he was brief this was specifically
[2:03:50.060 --> 2:03:55.100]  happened i mean they knew this think of the think of wanting to moralize america so bad
[2:03:55.100 --> 2:04:01.500]  they would do this even at this chance of destroying their puppet biden exactly exactly it's
[2:04:01.500 --> 2:04:07.340]  disgusting on every level it's just horrible yeah i mean that's all they really got alex
[2:04:07.740 --> 2:04:13.500]  talk about a lost opportunity can you imagine if the first time they shot at somebody or
[2:04:13.500 --> 2:04:17.980]  blew something up when they were in those convoys coming into those capitals towns and main cities
[2:04:17.980 --> 2:04:22.780]  they could have wiped the entire taliban out in a matter of hours but instead they just let a mass
[2:04:22.780 --> 2:04:29.500]  and drive in and take over need to remember that we cannot attack first this is 2021 psychological
[2:04:29.500 --> 2:04:35.580]  warfare against all of us it's horrible they need to attack first absolutely god bless you sir 60

[2:05:12.860 --> 2:05:17.340]  the man in the arena and i just remember thinking about that saying i want to be the man in the
[2:05:17.340 --> 2:05:22.620]  arena but when it comes to media info wars has been the tip of that spear but michael indell
[2:05:22.620 --> 2:05:28.220]  has come along and done just as good a job as we've done maybe even better when it comes to

[2:06:18.220 --> 2:06:22.300]  this is about global destabilization it's about this crediting america
[2:06:22.300 --> 2:06:25.260]  and it's about trillions and stolen war funds
[2:06:27.580 --> 2:06:35.420]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:06:36.860 --> 2:06:41.100]  i can play the clip over and over again of biden in july and then again in august
[2:06:42.220 --> 2:06:48.540]  saying we'll never have a saigon moment we'll never have a 1975 moment we will we have a giant
[2:06:48.540 --> 2:06:54.620]  300 000 person military they're unstoppable they will crush the taliban and then they all
[2:06:54.620 --> 2:07:00.940]  turned and instantly ran starting two weeks ago and the pentagon could have easily then when the
[2:07:00.940 --> 2:07:06.780]  taliban was attacking those retreating troops that's an act of aggression and they could have
[2:07:06.780 --> 2:07:12.460]  killed them all that's what trot was going to do and then withdraw but that didn't happen
[2:07:12.460 --> 2:07:24.140]  and it was done by design and so now total insanity is unfolding there and that's the
[2:07:24.140 --> 2:07:28.300]  same thing here with the mostly peaceful protests the burning down the cities and the antifa and
[2:07:28.300 --> 2:07:33.420]  the fentanyl and the you know the tents everywhere and the devaluation of the dollar and the the
[2:07:33.420 --> 2:07:38.380]  no countries no walls no usa at all and late night comedy saying officially white people
[2:07:38.380 --> 2:07:44.220]  are bad and evil and it's weird white people trying to teach the new minority majority to
[2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:50.940]  be like this i mean it's it's just absolutely a rearguard action by a bunch of companies worth
[2:07:50.940 --> 2:07:56.780]  trillions of dollars that are tax exempt and are in bed with china and have just made a deal to take
[2:07:56.780 --> 2:08:04.300]  the world over and white people at giant revivals praying to george floyd and apologizing for being
[2:08:04.300 --> 2:08:09.740]  white and the globalists just see this is art these are schmucks double their gas prices devalue
[2:08:09.740 --> 2:08:14.860]  their currency pay them to stay home and then they wonder why suddenly there's inflation and why
[2:08:14.860 --> 2:08:21.420]  there's no goods or medicine because no one's producing and then you look at what the lefts
[2:08:21.420 --> 2:08:29.900]  created it's a bunch of babies that drank fluoride water and that sat there and drank the formula
[2:08:29.900 --> 2:08:35.020]  that makes their brain about a third smaller and they're just low level and programmed and stupid
[2:08:35.020 --> 2:08:40.620]  and evil and then all over the country people protest dragling story time where they protest
[2:08:40.620 --> 2:08:45.900]  new lockdowns and then antifa comes out by the hundreds and stabs and beats and burns and shoots
[2:08:45.900 --> 2:08:52.060]  people and the local news says they're the good guys and then they say we're here for black people
[2:08:52.060 --> 2:08:57.020]  when 95 percent of them are white and i don't say that to defend black people like they're perfect
[2:08:57.020 --> 2:09:02.300]  i'm just saying antifa is a joke bunch of methhead devil worshipers
[2:09:05.660 --> 2:09:09.180]  attacking americans all because they want to have a country
[2:09:11.420 --> 2:09:17.180]  and they call themselves anti fascists when they work for george soros the most evil living fascists
[2:09:17.180 --> 2:09:25.820]  who actually work for hitler that's what blows me away man like Arnold Schwarzenegger is in rolling
[2:09:25.820 --> 2:09:29.740]  stone i made a documentary called martial law
[2:09:33.100 --> 2:09:37.340]  and in it i did like 10 minutes from Schwarzenegger he's wanting to be president then and was a thug
[2:09:37.340 --> 2:09:42.380]  i said i'll expose him and we mailed off and got the copies we made sure it was all correct
[2:09:42.940 --> 2:09:47.180]  up with the Schwarzenegger in the gay porn and i'm not attacking him because he sold his body
[2:09:47.180 --> 2:09:52.220]  for sex the point is that's how he's blackmailed and then he would like wear hitler outfits at
[2:09:52.220 --> 2:09:55.900]  parties and he said i love hitler everyone needs to do what the government says i mean
[2:09:56.700 --> 2:10:01.580]  now he says we're all bad people and screw your freedom no screw you buddy
[2:10:02.940 --> 2:10:08.940]  screw you it's just it's i can only take so much of the adl giving awards to all the real

[2:10:26.220 --> 2:10:31.420]  honor to talk to you i just really wanted to be uh quick i'm not one to call in but uh obviously
[2:10:32.060 --> 2:10:38.540]  i served in afghanistan um in 2015 2016 under uh the previous administration of you know obviously
[2:10:38.540 --> 2:10:46.700]  obama uh the things that we saw i mean was just ridiculous we came we went in reopened a uh a
[2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:51.420]  base up that it's a massive base camp whether that can help the province after they had shut
[2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:57.020]  it down about eight months before uh the amount of you know materials left behind we're literally
[2:10:57.020 --> 2:11:04.380]  we're rolling in you know you are my air force of engineers and uh the army uh 10th mount division
[2:11:04.380 --> 2:11:08.780]  that guys like that they came in that we were literally rolling around and pick up trucks while
[2:11:08.780 --> 2:11:13.580]  these people you know the a and a and and all those people have up armored vehicles and things
[2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:23.180]  like that so um the dichotomy between that i volunteered to go again in 2019 um and the difference
[2:11:23.180 --> 2:11:28.460]  between the two administrations we were absolutely taking care of business in 2019 the reason i
[2:11:28.460 --> 2:11:33.020]  volunteered was to actually have a peaceful transition to get us out of there the right
[2:11:33.020 --> 2:11:38.300]  way i believed in trump i actually did not vote for trump the first time i didn't trust him um
[2:11:38.300 --> 2:11:45.340]  but what i saw um over there alone wasn't enough to make me crawl across a bed of glass
[2:11:45.340 --> 2:11:51.340]  to vote for him uh just on that alone so we truly believed in that we thought we were doing such
[2:11:51.340 --> 2:11:58.460]  great work um obviously you know we wiped out most of the resistance in the north um that taliban
[2:11:58.460 --> 2:12:03.660]  you know couldn't they couldn't breach in all the years after we set them up you know um they
[2:12:03.660 --> 2:12:08.780]  they were never able to take this country now we have literally set them up this was done on purpose
[2:12:09.740 --> 2:12:15.820]  done on purpose to to like you said tarnish the possibility of peace and everything that we
[2:12:15.820 --> 2:12:20.460]  fought for literally has just gone straight down the drain and it's so disheartening to see that
[2:12:21.660 --> 2:12:27.660]  2.2 trillion hundreds of billions in infrastructure that could have been spent on america and the
[2:12:27.660 --> 2:12:32.940]  globalists didn't actually ever want to stabilize the area they just flushed it all down the toilet
[2:12:32.940 --> 2:12:37.420]  and all the american lives and other lives lost and then the afghan lives that tried to build a
[2:12:37.420 --> 2:12:43.180]  better country all of it flushed instantly in a matter of days by the globalist on purpose talk
[2:12:43.180 --> 2:12:50.700]  about evil well i mean look at look what we're dealing with now i come home and literally like
[2:12:50.700 --> 2:12:56.700]  two months ago we go through extremism training where the and the definitions are so vague and
[2:12:56.700 --> 2:13:01.820]  and i i spoke up and it's time for all of us as military personnel to speak up and stand up for
[2:13:01.820 --> 2:13:06.700]  what we believe in because if we don't it's gone if we lose freedom we are the last fashion of
[2:13:06.700 --> 2:13:11.100]  freedom if we lose freedom in the u.s it's gone from the face of the planet that's right communist
[2:13:11.100 --> 2:13:15.660]  china will be the model and the whole world will fall to it including us what do you make the now of
[2:13:15.660 --> 2:13:19.740]  them giving you the the anti-terror training while general milley saying worry about white people and
[2:13:19.740 --> 2:13:23.900]  people that question the election and worry about white supremacist the military and the stand down
[2:13:23.900 --> 2:13:28.620]  to you know for all those weeks to find the evil people and then now it's in the national strategy
[2:13:28.620 --> 2:13:34.220]  countering domestic terrorism plan that questioning the election or covet measures is terror i mean
[2:13:34.220 --> 2:13:40.620]  that is crazy that that they're leaving afghanistan and now trying to have the military get in a
[2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:45.420]  posture against the american people why would why would the globalist think that's even going to be
[2:13:45.420 --> 2:13:51.900]  successful i mean because they because they've not faced any backlash politically political
[2:13:51.900 --> 2:13:56.140]  correctness even in our military when you when you turn to a career military when you turn the
[2:13:56.140 --> 2:14:03.980]  military into a career people are begin to fear losing their jobs they fear standing up and the
[2:14:03.980 --> 2:14:09.020]  good the good people like me who refuse to stand by and watch it happen we're the ones that they're
[2:14:09.020 --> 2:14:12.940]  going to try to force out because i spoke up in the extremism training i said literally by this
[2:14:12.940 --> 2:14:18.460]  definition me as a as a gun owners of america or an nr a member this is literally setting this up
[2:14:18.460 --> 2:14:22.940]  you don't have a language now but that's this is exactly what you're setting up literally you're
[2:14:22.940 --> 2:14:27.500]  going to change the definition at some point just to include anyone that supports a gun rights
[2:14:27.500 --> 2:14:32.220]  organization or someone who practices literally the definition goes down down down from there
[2:14:32.220 --> 2:14:36.140]  and then a day later the next day we literally have our sapper training sexual assault response
[2:14:36.140 --> 2:14:40.300]  coordinator all that all that stuff that we go through and the first 30 minutes was them was this
[2:14:40.300 --> 2:14:46.540]  lady that's oh you know there was the sapper coordinator going over uh showing like 30 minutes
[2:14:46.540 --> 2:14:53.020]  worth of video about toxic masculinity and and and it was just and and and again what did i do
[2:14:53.020 --> 2:14:58.620]  i'm not to the to the to the chagrin of of my leadership i stood up and i challenged the lady
[2:14:58.620 --> 2:15:03.660]  that's not toxic masculinity has nothing to do with this this is toxic people talking you should
[2:15:03.660 --> 2:15:08.460]  have been learning about radical islam or about your enemies or about the globalist exactly or

[2:20:45.740 --> 2:20:52.860]  forget at tilman let's not forget operation red wings uh we all seen them a lot people seen the
[2:20:52.860 --> 2:21:00.220]  movie lone survivor uh you know this here is just another psychological operation to demoralize i
[2:21:00.220 --> 2:21:07.020]  think the during the press conference the other day they mentioned humiliation of american troops
[2:21:07.020 --> 2:21:13.900]  this is what this is this is to me humiliate us and to make us to seem weak um that's right having
[2:21:13.900 --> 2:21:19.180]  troops marching in red high heels having troops say they're racist it's all about demoralizing
[2:21:19.180 --> 2:21:25.500]  because we have an enemy force and control the government absolutely i mean this is just another
[2:21:25.500 --> 2:21:33.020]  another move uh by the globalists i mean joe biden is nothing he he's just a figurehead this has been
[2:21:33.020 --> 2:21:41.340]  going on for decades i mean this is this is nothing new uh in my opinion you know the fight it's time
[2:21:41.340 --> 2:21:47.340]  for america to stand up and start fighting back i mean we we can't wait you know i heard one guy
[2:21:47.340 --> 2:21:53.100]  speak one time that you know we'll never be stronger than we are today every day that goes by that we
[2:21:53.100 --> 2:21:59.580]  don't remove this here any this evil we're only getting weaker and they're chipping away at us
[2:21:59.580 --> 2:22:07.420]  piece by piece we remember obama you know he he did the purge of the upper brass uh it's it's all
[2:22:07.420 --> 2:22:13.260]  this is we got critical race theory who could even imagine we'd even be talking about this kind of
[2:22:13.260 --> 2:22:18.700]  stuff to our service members who would even imagine like the the last caller would even be talking
[2:22:18.700 --> 2:22:27.180]  about toxic masculinity i was an infantry soldier charlie 216 infantry rangers let me tell you something
[2:22:27.180 --> 2:22:33.020]  you want masculine men you don't want high heels on a front line you want men and you've got a job
[2:22:33.020 --> 2:22:42.780]  to do and you know this this whole push to demoralize to humiliate to weaken us we gotta shed that off
[2:22:42.780 --> 2:22:48.860]  it's time for america to understand that we are at war and now we're at war on our home front
[2:22:48.860 --> 2:22:55.020]  it's time we're almost about to that point for the broken arrow event where we we must utilize
[2:22:55.020 --> 2:23:01.020]  all resources to get this offer back if we don't there's no coming back well you're right but we
[2:23:01.020 --> 2:23:05.340]  have to navigate where they want to push us into violent confrontation so they can then even have
[2:23:05.340 --> 2:23:10.860]  more martial law but at the same time they are assaulting us with poison shots they are shutting
[2:23:10.860 --> 2:23:17.900]  down the economy they're just doing it all and so at the end of the day we're up against a very
[2:23:17.900 --> 2:23:22.060]  sophisticated enemy the only way to beat it is to get right with god is to get right with god
[2:23:22.060 --> 2:23:27.100]  and disregard everything cnn says everything obama says everything hillary says everything
[2:23:27.100 --> 2:23:32.460]  biden says and and just go back to what america is and just totally pull out of the corporate system
[2:23:33.900 --> 2:23:37.820]  all of it because this is literally a globalist takeover god bless you and i appreciate your
[2:23:37.820 --> 2:23:42.220]  call that's one of the best memes you're a tv viewer right there taliban in afghanistan they
[2:23:42.220 --> 2:23:48.780]  wait while trump's in and then as soon as biden gets sworn in they say now and they launch their
[2:23:48.780 --> 2:23:54.300]  attack and that's a perfect example of how this has been operating and they took the great thing
[2:23:54.300 --> 2:23:57.900]  trump was doing and just totally ruined it but then tried to blame trump for it even though biden
[2:23:57.900 --> 2:24:03.020]  promised this wouldn't happen showing he's a total fraud he's being set up though he's no mastermind
[2:24:03.020 --> 2:24:10.140]  okay let's go ahead and talk to john in florida he's an army served in iraq and afghanistan
[2:24:10.140 --> 2:24:18.860]  give us your view please hello yes sir go ahead yes uh i served in afghanistan and iraq basically
[2:24:18.860 --> 2:24:24.860]  i i think i saw this coming from a from a couple miles out you know they're trying to shake up
[2:24:24.860 --> 2:24:30.300]  the situation so that things can move in the country and i don't think everybody needs to get so
[2:24:30.300 --> 2:24:36.620]  discouraged it is a bad thing a lot of bad people bad people are gonna take over but i mean that's
[2:24:36.620 --> 2:24:43.660]  the story of this world right now if it's not them it's us it's everybody well i'm glad we're
[2:24:43.660 --> 2:24:48.700]  quote out of afghanistan i'm worried they're gonna use this fiasco as a pretext to try to get us to
[2:24:48.700 --> 2:24:55.980]  go back in i think that we'll probably be back in there in the next 10 20 years but right now i
[2:24:55.980 --> 2:25:02.380]  think everybody needs to just calm down and don't get angry and sad so much because we don't know
[2:25:02.380 --> 2:25:08.460]  what's going on behind the curtains we don't know what the next move is yet we just have to be patient
[2:25:09.100 --> 2:25:16.940]  and and be still and wait for our opportunities to make moves absolutely god bless you and i
[2:25:16.940 --> 2:25:22.060]  appreciate your call scroll back up guys to this article that's on info wars dot com about brutal
[2:25:22.060 --> 2:25:28.300]  memes against biden and it shows a little old lady insurrectionist worst terrorist uh worse than 9
[2:25:28.300 --> 2:25:34.060]  11 schumer and others said republicans agree they said she deserves to stay in jail in solitary
[2:25:34.060 --> 2:25:39.740]  confinement uh but jack was so big says if you look closely you can spot the difference there's the
[2:25:39.740 --> 2:25:45.980]  taliban in the palace they've taken over the government building they have guns they actually

[2:26:27.180 --> 2:26:32.300]  i put people in boxes and sent them home in this land number one of them has lived a devastating
[2:26:32.300 --> 2:26:40.300]  my heart my soul my spirit is crushed it hurts so bad taken off i still have brothers and arms uh i
[2:26:40.300 --> 2:26:45.740]  have a uh very good friend of mine he was called he was called to deploy to the embassy he got the
[2:26:45.740 --> 2:26:51.020]  phone call friday night uh saturday afternoon was the last time we heard from him we have not heard
[2:26:51.020 --> 2:26:57.180]  from it since uh when i talked to him saturday afternoon he was telling me some very disgruntled
[2:26:57.180 --> 2:27:03.500]  things one of which was the whole reason why the whole reason why this has been such a quote
[2:27:03.500 --> 2:27:08.940]  unquote peaceful takeover is as we're pulling out they're just walking in uh is because
[2:27:08.940 --> 2:27:13.820]  it's a lot a lot of the soldiers that went over there to support the withdrawal from the embassy
[2:27:14.380 --> 2:27:21.340]  um they're under the belief that the taliban is being reinforced by a foreign entity however
[2:27:21.340 --> 2:27:29.260]  you're talking about iran that's what i was told yes sir uh i was told i mean my contact my person
[2:27:29.260 --> 2:27:35.180]  said that uh people are saying iran some people are saying china so there's there's well that's
[2:27:35.180 --> 2:27:39.020]  they're both allied it's china and iran you're absolutely right that's what's going on and
[2:27:39.020 --> 2:27:44.940]  again biden biden made that deal and then said trump cut that deal no trump didn't cut that deal
[2:27:44.940 --> 2:27:49.820]  so this is incredible treason and listen brother don't let it get you down america didn't do this
[2:27:49.820 --> 2:27:54.540]  we got hijacked by a very sophisticated takeover system the most sophisticated the world's ever
[2:27:54.540 --> 2:27:59.260]  seen and we're we're half the country's awake so we haven't lost this thing yet but yeah the numbers
[2:27:59.260 --> 2:28:03.980]  are coming in we've got articles next segment taliban's going door to door killing the people
[2:28:03.980 --> 2:28:08.300]  that worked with u.s personnel in their houses so if you work for an american or you work to
[2:28:08.300 --> 2:28:12.620]  the embassy they've got a list they're going around door to door killing people so everybody
[2:28:12.620 --> 2:28:16.460]  hates america all day all these leftists hate it but wait till the thin veneer of civilization

[2:33:50.540 --> 2:33:57.100]  coverage of that in the war room 3 p.m the best way to tell the story is what happened a very
[2:33:57.100 --> 2:34:07.100]  prominent medical doctor discovered with one of their people that works with them that a hospital
[2:34:07.100 --> 2:34:13.340]  uh in florida was basically doing protocols that would kill people and they're getting ready to call
[2:34:13.340 --> 2:34:18.540]  the show the next few days but they said why don't you talk to steven gaffanti who's a medical
[2:34:18.540 --> 2:34:22.860]  doctor and actually even know who he is because he's uh got a lot of very well-known best-selling
[2:34:22.860 --> 2:34:29.420]  books and programs that i even personally years ago used with one of my children uh so uh he's got
[2:34:29.420 --> 2:34:35.100]  rocket phonics and so much more but he's also a medical doctor and so i i thought i would have
[2:34:35.100 --> 2:34:38.540]  this other medical doctor on the day but they're not ready right now they want to they're really
[2:34:38.540 --> 2:34:41.420]  pissed off they want to get their ducks in a row before they come on they said no you ought to
[2:34:41.420 --> 2:34:46.940]  interview this doctor uh so he's on with us and he was put into the hospital he almost killed him
[2:34:46.940 --> 2:34:51.660]  rob dude a big hospital in austin said you're not giving me anything you're not giving me steroids
[2:34:51.660 --> 2:34:57.180]  you're not giving me vitamin c you're not you're not giving me ivs i get nothing they were like
[2:34:57.180 --> 2:35:02.380]  talking about intubating him so he got up and left he's fine now he's coming back in a few days but
[2:35:02.380 --> 2:35:07.260]  but back a year ago i told you the hospitals weren't more full than usual now i told you a month ago
[2:35:07.260 --> 2:35:11.980]  they're full and now it's all over the news i mean half the people i know have covid they're sick
[2:35:11.980 --> 2:35:16.140]  right now my parents are both like fish out of water and gulping for air at the house right now
[2:35:16.140 --> 2:35:20.460]  i'm going but as soon as i get off air i'm going to take care of them and i'm working with a great
[2:35:20.460 --> 2:35:20.460]  physician we'll get rob and others better so dr steven
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:42.060]  dr steven defante it comes on with us rocket phonics dot com covered his whole bio would take you know the time we have i want inviting back we have more time for a full hour to give us overall view of this but please because you're the expert your medical doctor tell us what you experience what you saw in the red flags that concerns you so much sir and thanks for coming on
[2:35:42.060 --> 2:36:06.700]  oh you're welcome so well august first i was admitted to our local hospital and for cove it and uh they put me on a protocol
[2:36:06.700 --> 2:36:36.620]  this is not real medicine anyway i'm getting better on the protocol the next day they put in a man 20 years younger than me and he's getting worse so Thursday i decide you know i'm getting ready to leave and i'm listening to him breathe because i'm a doctor i'm in the page i'm in the bed next to him and we we listen to patients breathe especially if they're breathing rapidly and it looks like they're going south
[2:36:36.700 --> 2:37:06.620]  uh so i ask him why are you getting worse he says i don't know i say do you want me to be your patient advocate he says yes i say fine let's call the nurse and take a look at your labs so we do that we look at his labs and they missed and they missed an infection
[2:37:07.500 --> 2:37:28.620]  um for any doctors out there his white count was spiking as x-ray showed a worsening pneumonia so this is two o'clock in the afternoon six hours later no doctor shows up nobody so now it's two in the morning
[2:37:28.620 --> 2:37:54.940]  his poor guy is struggling to breathe he's working on roughly a fourth of a lung you just can't breathe through pus i'm sorry to offend anybody but anyway so i then ask for his doctor and they take his name the name of his doctor off the board they walk out of the room and abandon the patient
[2:37:54.940 --> 2:38:10.940]  they call security and have the patient's uh uh the patient advocate which is me forcibly removed from the room and i say to him you don't have to do that i'll leave am a
[2:38:10.940 --> 2:38:28.940]  no i mean it is clearly i mean i had infectious disease on the phone and they wouldn't talk to him there's nothing i can do i might as well go home they put me in four point restraints and put me in solitary confinement for four hours
[2:38:28.940 --> 2:38:40.940]  wow do you talk about that and by the way doctor this story is coming out everywhere around the world just because this new corporate protocol is this wow so they so they literally chain you up
[2:38:40.940 --> 2:39:04.940]  yes yeah two guards take my arms and two nurses take my legs and they tie me down to the bed and i'm 70 years old right all i want to do is go home so so then they leave me without
[2:39:04.940 --> 2:39:16.940]  any water any food i have to pee on the floor and then they they're watching by camera and laughing eventually some doctor decides
[2:39:16.940 --> 2:39:34.940]  maybe i could go home and so four or five hours later i got to go home as i understand it they eventually put them on antibiotics and and uh into bed put them on a ventilator
[2:39:34.940 --> 2:39:50.940]  um the guy is a marathon runner he's got a tremendous lung capacity when it's not filled with pus so if he lives he should he should we should know in a day or two
[2:39:50.940 --> 2:40:02.940]  incredible so we got put in touch with you by another major medical doctor a well known name is not ready to talk about the ship but this is happening to their people to their family the exact same thing but they know what they're doing
[2:40:02.940 --> 2:40:14.940]  and when they say hey i want antibiotics or hey i want this the same thing they're muscling in and threatening them and chaining people down in things i mean is this something you ever heard about medical school what does this sound like to you doctor
[2:40:14.940 --> 2:40:27.940]  this is this is the here's the foundational problem the doctor is being paid by the hospital and so the doctor does what the hospital tells him to do
[2:40:27.940 --> 2:40:41.940]  that's your problem none of these patients in these hospitals have a doctor the doctors are all owned and so um you know you get a patient with pneumonia
[2:40:41.940 --> 2:40:53.940]  if the CEO says we don't treat pneumonia with antibiotics anymore and the doctor wants to work at that hospital he doesn't treat with antibiotics
[2:40:53.940 --> 2:41:03.940]  that's that's your problem which which i always thought doctors when i was dumb were weird to give antibiotics even if it was viral but now i've learned that viruses are carried in by bacteria that you want to give them an antiviral
[2:41:03.940 --> 2:41:15.940]  antibiotic and and and a uh antibiotic unless you know it's viral but but you were saying it's white blood count you could see this on his chart i guess you were saying yeah he definitely had an infection he needed antibiotics
[2:41:15.940 --> 2:41:31.940]  yeah so alex the protocol for cove it includes suppressing the immune system the complication of a suppressed immune system is that you get a bacterial pneumonia not the viral
[2:41:31.940 --> 2:41:47.940]  so my white count for instance was 3.7 i was viral his went from 11 to 16 to 20 he was bacterial just that simple and and of course absolutely
[2:41:47.940 --> 2:41:57.940]  so let me ask you this how is this happening everywhere where they just follow the computer generated order of the what hospitals bioethics board and then they don't render care and that's murder
[2:41:57.940 --> 2:42:09.940]  yes it's murder and and if this guy didn't have a doctor sitting next to him in the sitting in on the bed next to him he'd be dead by now
[2:42:09.940 --> 2:42:21.940]  a 50 year old marathon runner died from bacterial pneumonia that's been treated with antibiotics for the last 80 years that is disgusting
[2:42:21.940 --> 2:42:27.940]  and it's all a change in policy and then when he dies they call it covered in the hospital it's $53,000
[2:42:27.940 --> 2:42:39.940]  you know the problem is the doctors work for the the the CEO of the hospital so if the CEO says make it covered the doctors right covered
[2:42:39.940 --> 2:42:51.940]  and then they treat us covered not a spectral pneumonia wow you've you've this is what's happened stay there explain as a medical doctor 70 year old doctor well respected best well-known author I mean how I bought his book before
[2:42:51.940 --> 2:42:59.940]  that happened to him this is just insane this is the corporate takeover of medicine equivalent of the deep water horizon BP situation

[2:43:58.940 --> 2:44:10.940]  so when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on their show and I listened to it
[2:44:10.940 --> 2:44:21.940]  so the first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that you know with a deep burn source you know and I got really excited about that so I took it
[2:44:21.940 --> 2:44:34.940]  and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back

[2:47:52.940 --> 2:48:05.940]  I mean the fact that they would do this to you shows a change in the culture completely and medicines never been perfect but the Hippocratic oath as we know has been out the window for decades and and and as you said
[2:48:05.940 --> 2:48:20.940]  the past hospitals and other things were supposed to be managed by doctors and more and more we know they're not and I use the deep water horizon analogy where they ordered the engineers to not pour in concrete on top of the whole and they said it will explode they said no we're going to save a
[2:48:20.940 --> 2:48:40.940]  we're going to do it it blew up and it seems like the same thing like these big corporate owners are so detached that they came out with this U.N. policy says everything is covered and we don't treat back bacterial pneumonia or we don't treat the flu anymore we treat covid and then the covid treatment kills you is that what you're saying sir
[2:48:40.940 --> 2:49:07.940]  no I think the CEO of that hospital has created a culture of a prison culture rather than a hospital culture you know there were six nurses out in the hallway discussing how to put me in three and four point restraints rather than let me go home when all I want to do was sign out
[2:49:07.940 --> 2:49:30.940]  A.M.A. now Alex I'm an ER doc I started out at L.A. County jail you don't get much worse than L.A. County Jails emergency room and every once in a while you meet a patient who's just obnoxious and if that patient ever said I want to leave the hospital we would rush the A.M.A.
[2:49:30.940 --> 2:49:50.940]  paper to him say sign here the doors there at no time did we say oh no let's put them in four point restraints and and and solitary for four hours that is crazy and I was telling the doctors this is crazy just let me go home I'm sorry
[2:49:50.940 --> 2:50:07.940]  don't know doctor was available at no time did they ever let the doctor couldn't come into that room in fact and by the way doctor I agree with you that it's a prison planet culture I have a website called prison planet dot com or did we need to keep updating it
[2:50:07.940 --> 2:50:19.940]  I'm just saying you're talking about what you saw on the ground the prison behavior I'm saying we're seeing this from hospitals all over the world now with the way they quote treat covid and I'm saying you have any view on where that's coming from
[2:50:19.940 --> 2:50:38.940]  I think it's coming from the CEO of the hospitals and I think they're taking their orders from some law or or government of you know and W.H.O. where it's coming from so please continue this is just amazing where do you where do you think this should go what should happen next
[2:50:38.940 --> 2:50:58.940]  I think the CEO the head of security and the head of nursing need to be removed from that hospital and they need to put in somebody that understands the difference between a jail and a hospital and and those people need to create a new culture in that hospital
[2:50:58.940 --> 2:51:27.940]  and and if this is happening in other hospitals which it probably is the same thing the fundamental problem is the doctors work for the hospital not the patient that's the problem if you continue to allow CEOs to hire doctors rather than let the doctors work at the hospitals for the patient you're going to have this problem
[2:51:27.940 --> 2:51:45.940]  you can cover up this one you can cover up another one but this this problem is a simple conflict of interest so you're saying the tyranny in medicine is because it's become corporate yes well beautiful summary that's exactly what's going on
[2:51:45.940 --> 2:51:48.940]  and the government should get out of medicine
[2:51:48.940 --> 2:51:59.940]  well I mean I know Ron Paul very well and people thought it was crazy when it came out that he would do a third of his practice for free my dad always did that he's recently retired and you seem like you're an old fashioned real doctor
[2:51:59.940 --> 2:52:12.940]  I mean have they eradicated this culture of the doctor everybody respected and liked that you know that really cared about people because don't they want to be the nice sweet hospital why do they want to be a prison I don't get that
[2:52:12.940 --> 2:52:28.940]  you know I think it's because the CEO isn't a patient it's a CEO got tied down into four point restraints they would rapidly change the culture
[2:52:28.940 --> 2:52:41.940]  Well let me ask you this because usually nurses know when it's a doctor in the hospital they respect you I mean doctors have a lot of power still people still respect you even though we've lost a lot of credibility with the corporate takeover they had no fear of you they had no fear doing this to you
[2:52:41.940 --> 2:52:49.940]  No none and yes they had Dr. Gaffanti on the board so they knew I was a doctor
[2:52:49.940 --> 2:52:57.940]  Well heck I diagnosed the pneumonia in the patient next to me so you know of course they knew I was a doctor
[2:52:57.940 --> 2:53:14.940]  I had an infectious disease doctor on the phone at two o'clock in the morning all they had to do was take the phone out of my hand talk to the specialist who had privileges at that hospital
[2:53:14.940 --> 2:53:37.940]  So they don't even respect doctors that have privileges at the hospital? No no no they wouldn't even tell the patient his doctor's name it was it was the worst medicine I have ever experienced and it was uniform it wasn't like it was one nurse
[2:53:37.940 --> 2:53:54.940]  There were six of them it wasn't like there was one security guard there were two or three of them and none of them thought hey maybe we should save the patient's life maybe maybe we should get a doctor involved none of them
[2:53:54.940 --> 2:54:09.940]  Well that happened to my main news manager he's never sick he you know he plays basketball he rides 20 miles every other day on his bike you know had a college college basketball he's in great shape he's the same age as me he's a lot better than I am
[2:54:09.940 --> 2:54:20.940]  And he went to the hospital he was concerned with COVID and no one for two days even saw him nothing happened he just went home
[2:54:20.940 --> 2:54:34.940]  That's so sad. Let me ask you this I didn't see a lot of sickness last year there's always sickness but I saw a bunch of hyping up full hospitals somewhere full we know I'm seeing massive illness everybody half the people I know are sick right now
[2:54:34.940 --> 2:54:40.940]  I mean I have friends around the country they say the same thing what are you hearing doctor?
[2:54:40.940 --> 2:54:53.940]  Well most of us you know I'm I hang out with retired doctors they do not take the vaccine they do not go near the hospital and they're all fine
[2:54:53.940 --> 2:55:01.940]  I just happen to teach little kids to read and little kids have lots of bugs and maybe I got it from them
[2:55:01.940 --> 2:55:13.940]  Absolutely so I've got the papers here you're a medical doctor what about the sluffing because in the research of these vaccines it says there'd be a big problem with shedding and then even Germany passed the law these vaccines are allowed to shed
[2:55:13.940 --> 2:55:17.940]  Everybody I know that's getting sick was around a vaccinated person
[2:55:17.940 --> 2:55:27.940]  Yes well 95% of the doctors at the hospital are vaccinated so they're shedding to their patients
[2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:40.940]  Well I would love to get you back for a full hour soon doctor any other points you'd like to make about what happened I mean I guess we should list the hospital I'm more than happy do you want to list the hospital you're in so people can steer clear of it
[2:55:40.940 --> 2:55:45.940]  Yeah absolutely Sarasota Memorial Hospital
[2:55:45.940 --> 2:55:51.940]  Here's the problem we need that hospital as a hospital not a jail
[2:55:51.940 --> 2:56:05.940]  And you know I don't know what's going on but I do know that I had an infectious disease specialist on the phone ready to help and they would not listen to him
[2:56:05.940 --> 2:56:16.940]  I do know that the patient next to me had this pneumonia had the bacterial pneumonia for four days and they didn't bother treating it
[2:56:16.940 --> 2:56:31.940]  And I do know that they had every ability to inform the doctor that this patient had a bacterial pneumonia and needed to have a different protocol added
[2:56:31.940 --> 2:56:42.940]  Let me ask you this how do we fight back against this because I know you just reported on what you saw let me tell you this is happening all over the world and it's corporately run just like it's a battle plan that's gone out
[2:56:42.940 --> 2:56:53.940]  How do we counter that I guess with good doctors like you and others having facts and speaking up I mean I'm not a litigious person but if that guy dies that you were in there with we've got to get in touch with his family and sue their ass
[2:56:53.940 --> 2:57:06.940]  Here's what I would do take over the hospital boards with some with docs that are not contracted with the hospital right you need independent doctors
[2:57:06.940 --> 2:57:12.940]  Take over the hospital boards and the CEO will call a different tune
[2:57:12.940 --> 2:57:19.940]  And by the way I know you know this before those that don't know they've changed state laws but used to until recently you had to have real doctors on the board
[2:57:19.940 --> 2:57:21.940]  I didn't know that
[2:57:21.940 --> 2:57:23.940]  At least in Texas yeah
[2:57:23.940 --> 2:57:34.940]  Yeah it's an awful job I wouldn't want to volunteer for my my own time to spend talking to these bureaucrats but it needs to be done
[2:57:34.940 --> 2:57:45.940]  You we have half a million people here in Sarasota a third of them are old and they can't they can't have a hospital that's treated that thinks they're a prisoner
[2:57:45.940 --> 2:57:48.940]  Stephen Gaffonte an amazing doctor God bless you

[2:58:49.940 --> 2:58:55.940]  The world is awakening the world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm
[2:58:55.940 --> 2:59:06.940]  They are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the CFR the trilateral Commission the Bilderberg group the Bohemian Grove the club of Rome
[2:59:06.940 --> 2:59:16.940]  And so even though it seems like the globalist are winning the truth is they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing
[2:59:16.940 --> 2:59:25.940]  We have forced them out in the open so as bad as these times are a lot of negative things are about to happen realize humanity is winning
[2:59:25.940 --> 2:59:35.940]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice that is invincible that is ethereal timeless and unstoppable
[2:59:35.940 --> 2:59:49.940]  So don't trust in man trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action against the globalist and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you we will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender
[3:00:05.940 --> 3:00:17.940]  I'm told very patiently from California it's all Army and Air Force a few Marines calling them we appreciate you all nobody from the Navy but I guess the Navy really weren't many in the Navy there in Afghanistan

[3:00:34.940 --> 3:00:37.940]  It's honor and talk to you honor to talk to you brother
[3:00:37.940 --> 3:00:46.940]  Hey I just thanks for look linking up with bio pros I just bought the bio pro for my RV so thank you in advance
[3:00:46.940 --> 3:00:56.940]  Well thank you brother we're in one hell of a fight against the globalist so your financial support is I mean I'm sorry to say you imagine without info wars being here because the audience is great and you're great and everybody's great
[3:00:56.940 --> 3:01:08.940]  I'm not even that good of a person you know I mean I mean well but I'm a train wreck but you know we write the talking points for the resistance now and I'm not trying to brag about that but it really is true that's what they want to
[3:01:08.940 --> 3:01:12.940]  So don't think me Ryan I want to thank you brother go ahead
[3:01:12.940 --> 3:01:24.940]  Well I just appreciate you make products that are you know beneficial anyway I would like to tell a story about the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan if I can
[3:01:24.940 --> 3:01:26.940]  Tell us
[3:01:26.940 --> 3:01:35.940]  Well this is a very strange place in Afghanistan they're very localized and very closed off people
[3:01:35.940 --> 3:01:43.940]  And it's the border there with China, Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan right there in the new Kush
[3:01:43.940 --> 3:01:55.940]  People they speak in parables so it's very hard to understand them but they just don't want you there
[3:01:55.940 --> 3:02:03.940]  Anyway the Chinese are out there they're trying to exploit these people and steal their natural resources
[3:02:03.940 --> 3:02:14.940]  They're so abundant out there that literally where the bombs have been placed and it's now jagged rocks and stuff sometimes you'll see rubies
[3:02:14.940 --> 3:02:26.940]  Raw rubies just sticking out of the mountainside or veins of gold and they don't know these people are just goat farmers they don't really understand what they have
[3:02:26.940 --> 3:02:34.940]  But if you say oh I like your rock they say don't touch my rock
[3:02:34.940 --> 3:02:46.940]  I don't know it's just a very strange different culture out there and these people they just want to be left alone
[3:02:46.940 --> 3:02:53.940]  And it's sad to know that all of our efforts have fallen in vain
[3:02:53.940 --> 3:02:58.940]  I know this brother and I appreciate your call Ryan thanks for calling
[3:02:58.940 --> 3:03:03.940]  They set this up to still 2.2 trillion and now they want to wreck it so there's no progress out of it
[3:03:03.940 --> 3:03:08.940]  It's all done by design in my view. Thank you for the call. Let's talk to Jesse in Missouri. Jesse welcome
[3:03:08.940 --> 3:03:13.940]  Hey Alex how you doing? It's great to be on your show thanks for speaking the truth all the time
[3:03:13.940 --> 3:03:14.940]  Thank you
[3:03:14.940 --> 3:03:28.940]  Hey I just wanted to say that I've echoed your sentiments for a very long time. I did two tours in Afghanistan and the control and takeover has been happening for a long time against the military as you know
[3:03:28.940 --> 3:03:36.940]  We started off with the Bush administration the Obama administration had a design plan to destabilize that area
[3:03:36.940 --> 3:03:44.940]  And so basically there was a lot of people like me 17, 18, 19 years old after 9-11 we weren't thinking about false flags
[3:03:44.940 --> 3:03:48.940]  We weren't thinking about anything except the patriotism and love we have for this country
[3:03:48.940 --> 3:03:52.940]  So we signed right up and we volunteered to go fight for this country
[3:03:52.940 --> 3:03:58.940]  When the higher echelon and the higher rank get in charge they no longer become soldiers
[3:03:58.940 --> 3:04:00.940]  When you put a star on you're a politician
[3:04:00.940 --> 3:04:08.940]  When you have to be approved by Congress you're a politician these politicians bow down to whatever administration is in charge at the time
[3:04:08.940 --> 3:04:14.940]  The Obama administration definitely took aim and so did the Bush administration with no child left behind
[3:04:14.940 --> 3:04:22.940]  The Obama administration brainwashed these young service members that are in now to be exactly who they are right now
[3:04:22.940 --> 3:04:30.940]  Also another thing that's devastating to our country is when we stopped doing force on force training
[3:04:30.940 --> 3:04:38.940]  When we stopped making sure that we're capable of taking on another military, another army and we stopped doing that
[3:04:38.940 --> 3:04:42.940]  We went straight to counterterrorism training we went to counterinsurgency
[3:04:42.940 --> 3:04:50.940]  So we've left ourselves depleted in the ability to be able to fight a big country like China or Iran
[3:04:50.940 --> 3:04:54.940]  And the plan all along, thank you Jesse, amazing points, Kyle, Barry and Joe
[3:04:54.940 --> 3:05:20.940]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt I was in sixth grade and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena
[3:05:20.940 --> 3:05:29.940]  That's pure, but Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues

[3:06:32.940 --> 3:06:43.940]  Mike Lindell had his big three day conference, 90% of it was accurate info, really powerful algorithms, proof of fraud, all sorts of election fraud came out
[3:06:43.940 --> 3:06:49.940]  And then they had the classic eight-chan, four-chan group that sets everybody up, set him up with fake data
[3:06:49.940 --> 3:06:55.940]  And the guy that gave it to him had a stroke and you know it couldn't be seen and that's how they do this folks
[3:06:55.940 --> 3:07:02.940]  And I've been set up before, so I don't blame Mike Lindell, he's a great guy, he's going to stay in the arena and fight for election integrity
[3:07:02.940 --> 3:07:07.940]  We've got 20 states to pass laws, that's a democratic fraud, we're fighting hard
[3:07:07.940 --> 3:07:11.940]  So it's important to keep supporting Mike Lindell, a man in the arena, and info wars

[3:09:05.940 --> 3:09:12.940]  But the Democrat Party law firm run by Senator Blumenthal on record that owns the judges, owns everything
[3:09:12.940 --> 3:09:16.940]  They are the ones that have sued us all over the place and run all these things
[3:09:16.940 --> 3:09:22.940]  They're the ones that bankrupted the oldest U.S. firearms company, Remington
[3:09:22.940 --> 3:09:26.940]  They're the ones that Remington's trying to settle for 35 million, they don't even take it
[3:09:26.940 --> 3:09:30.940]  They said we want a billion, even though Remington's closed, it's done, it's over
[3:09:30.940 --> 3:09:32.940]  That's who we're up against, and it's okay
[3:09:32.940 --> 3:09:36.940]  Because we're going to continue on and we're not a firearms manufacturing operation
[3:09:36.940 --> 3:09:39.940]  They may want to kill the First Amendment and the Second Amendment
[3:09:39.940 --> 3:09:43.940]  But they're not going to stop us because we're not a firearms manufacturing facility
[3:09:43.940 --> 3:09:48.940]  But you notice, Mexico is now suing a bunch of gun manufacturers
[3:09:48.940 --> 3:09:54.940]  When it was Obama under Fast and Furious, shipped over a million of them to Mexico and then to Syria for the Civil War
[3:09:54.940 --> 3:09:59.940]  So it's the same group, it's the same organization, and they want your speech and they want your guns
[3:09:59.940 --> 3:10:03.940]  So when you support us, if you spread the word and share articles and videos
[3:10:03.940 --> 3:10:09.940]  You're putting your thumb in the eye of the worst Democrat party mafia organizations there are
[3:10:09.940 --> 3:10:11.940]  I'm proud to have those enemies
[3:10:11.940 --> 3:10:17.940]  But let me tell you, they got us tied up like a billy goat and it's absolutely a fake trial, fake garbage, all of it
[3:10:17.940 --> 3:10:20.940]  That's okay, that's all going to come out
[3:10:20.940 --> 3:10:26.940]  We're going to stay on air and we're going to continue on in many other ways and not be stopped
[3:10:26.940 --> 3:10:31.940]  And this will be a great example to everyone and we've got a lot of tricks up our sleeve, I'll just leave it at that
[3:10:31.940 --> 3:10:36.940]  And so let's just say this, they're walking right into their trap
[3:10:36.940 --> 3:10:41.940]  That's for us, that will end up being a trap for them, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior
[3:10:41.940 --> 3:10:48.940]  Alright, real fast, Kyle in Mississippi, then Barry and Joe, go ahead, give me each about two minutes, go ahead, Kyle
[3:10:48.940 --> 3:10:53.940]  Hey Alex, it's great to talk to a longtime listener, first-time caller
[3:10:53.940 --> 3:11:01.940]  I'm a 20-year Air Force veteran, did seven different tours to Afghanistan between the summer of 2009 and the spring of 2014
[3:11:01.940 --> 3:11:09.940]  And I was an aerial gunner over there, so I had a lot of experience dealing with what was going on with the ground, with the Taliban and the enemy
[3:11:09.940 --> 3:11:17.940]  And I was telling guys back then, we all knew, just talking amongst each other away from leadership, that the way the rules of engagement were established under Obama
[3:11:17.940 --> 3:11:23.940]  That we knew that whenever we did pull out of Afghanistan, that place was going to fall within a couple months
[3:11:23.940 --> 3:11:33.940]  We had no faith in the Afghan army, or whoever else was going to take over Afghan police and stuff, just because they've had all these years to do something
[3:11:33.940 --> 3:11:39.940]  And they can't do anything, they just turn around, they run away, they defect, you got blue on green incidences all the time
[3:11:39.940 --> 3:11:48.940]  So this shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody, but as a veteran who served over there, I'm absolutely disgusted with what I've seen and what this has turned into
[3:11:48.940 --> 3:11:56.940]  And it is a slap in the face to the veterans and the people that served over there, all the blood, sweat, tears, everything else that went into that
[3:11:56.940 --> 3:12:03.940]  To see it come to this after 20 years, and to hear that there's still US citizens that are over there trying to get out, and that Kirby comes out
[3:12:03.940 --> 3:12:09.940]  The spokesman that says that they're not going to take priority to get them out of there first, it's just absolutely disgusting, Alex
[3:12:09.940 --> 3:12:12.940]  I just can't believe what it's come to
[3:12:12.940 --> 3:12:15.940]  Do you agree it's designed to demoralize us?
[3:12:15.940 --> 3:12:18.940]  Yes, in a certain way, I think that is the case
[3:12:18.940 --> 3:12:24.940]  I've got a couple buddies that I talked to on a regular basis that are still active duty that are getting close to the end of their careers
[3:12:24.940 --> 3:12:30.940]  And they can't wait to retire, I mean they don't want to throw away a pension when you're at the 18-19 year mark
[3:12:30.940 --> 3:12:39.940]  But they're absolutely disgusted by what's going on, the woke-ism in the military, the pushing of transgenderism, and all this other kind of stuff that's going on the basis
[3:12:39.940 --> 3:12:41.940]  And the weakening of our military
[3:12:41.940 --> 3:12:46.940]  I agree with them, they should stay in even longer because of this, this is an attempt to run them out
[3:12:46.940 --> 3:12:49.940]  They ought to sit there and agree with it, and then leak all the information
[3:12:49.940 --> 3:12:51.940]  God bless you Kyle, I appreciate you
[3:12:51.940 --> 3:12:54.940]  This is a foreign globalist takeover, Gerald Solentale will respond to it
[3:12:54.940 --> 3:12:56.940]  On the other side when he takes over, I can't wait to hear what he has to say
[3:12:56.940 --> 3:13:00.940]  Real fast, Barry in Arizona, then Joe, go ahead
[3:13:00.940 --> 3:13:09.940]  Thanks for taking my call, I don't know if you saw this from Chicago, sometimes reporting the Associated Press
[3:13:09.940 --> 3:13:18.940]  A statement from the Taliban spokesperson that says that they're going to create an inclusive Islamic regime
[3:13:18.940 --> 3:13:22.940]  So it looks like the Taliban are going woke
[3:13:22.940 --> 3:13:26.940]  I did see that, yeah
[3:13:26.940 --> 3:13:37.940]  All over this, that means the Chinese are all over this, but what I know is as soon as the 2020 election debacle happened, the Chinese had negotiators and advisors on the ground
[3:13:37.940 --> 3:13:43.940]  And those are all intelligence agents, but they were on the ground in Afghanistan to go to cheating with the Taliban
[3:13:43.940 --> 3:13:48.940]  The Taliban sold out to the Chinese and they have Afghan security forces sold out to the Taliban
[3:13:48.940 --> 3:13:55.940]  So they're going to have some bloodshed, but it's going to be kind of on the light side because this is going to attract back to China
[3:13:55.940 --> 3:13:57.940]  And they're playing a propaganda war
[3:13:57.940 --> 3:14:02.940]  I totally agree, it's just like the Vici French had already sold out to Hitler, he kind of did a play invasion of France
[3:14:02.940 --> 3:14:07.940]  Absolutely, everything's already been sold out to the Taliban and the Chinese, I agree
[3:14:07.940 --> 3:14:14.940]  So this is one of Trump's blind spots, he should have really pushed for not only not withdrawing from Afghanistan
[3:14:14.940 --> 3:14:19.940]  But turning Afghanistan into a permanent territory of the United States
[3:14:19.940 --> 3:14:23.940]  I don't know if I agree with that statement, but Barry, I appreciate your call
[3:14:23.940 --> 3:14:27.940]  No, I got to jump, call me back tomorrow, I want to take a lot of calls on this
[3:14:27.940 --> 3:14:31.940]  And the war room's coming up in 45 minutes, but Joe in Oklahoma, go ahead, last caller
[3:14:31.940 --> 3:14:39.940]  Yes sir, just to echo what everyone else is saying and to echo what Jack Russobuk was saying this morning
[3:14:39.940 --> 3:14:47.940]  Basically the refugees are being brought here instead of UAE, Qatar or whatever, that sounds like replacement theory to me
[3:14:47.940 --> 3:14:54.940]  And then the other thing too is putting a name to the initiative, it's called the Silk Road Initiative
[3:14:54.940 --> 3:15:00.940]  People need to do their research and be educated on this, all the intelligence and all that stuff, what China's doing
[3:15:00.940 --> 3:15:04.940]  That's what it's called, it's to bring your Asia together
[3:15:04.940 --> 3:15:08.940]  So that's my two cents, so everyone gets more educated
[3:15:08.940 --> 3:15:14.940]  I totally agree, it's about Chai Khan power and about Biden delivering that Chai Khan power, it's the Silk Road
[3:15:14.940 --> 3:15:19.940]  It doesn't mean I want to be an Afghanistan, it doesn't mean I support, I like Trump's plan to get out
[3:15:19.940 --> 3:15:24.940]  I'm saying the way this was done, they knew it would be spectacularly embarrassing
[3:15:24.940 --> 3:15:27.940]  Why do you think they did it?
[3:15:27.940 --> 3:15:33.940]  Well, probably just what everyone else is saying, it's basically weak enough
[3:15:33.940 --> 3:15:36.940]  But again, it goes back to that Silk Road Initiative
[3:15:36.940 --> 3:15:42.940]  All roads lead back to the CCP, in the sense of economic power, military power
[3:15:42.940 --> 3:15:49.940]  Yes, there's probably going to be bloodshed between the Chinese and Taliban, but the Chinese aren't going to play like we are
[3:15:49.940 --> 3:15:51.940]  They will be ruthless
[3:15:51.940 --> 3:15:53.940]  Alright, I hear you, thank you so much
[3:15:53.940 --> 3:16:07.940]  Alright, Gerald Salante takes over, let us out of this break, stay with us
[3:16:23.940 --> 3:16:34.940]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too
[3:16:34.940 --> 3:16:41.940]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on
[3:16:41.940 --> 3:16:45.940]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death
[3:16:45.940 --> 3:16:48.940]  You probably already believe that, I certainly do
[3:16:48.940 --> 3:16:58.940]  So here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support
[3:16:58.940 --> 3:17:03.940]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com
[3:17:03.940 --> 3:17:08.940]  No cures or treatments there, instead, little-known but shocking immune system research

[3:17:29.940 --> 3:17:34.940]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house
[3:17:34.940 --> 3:17:38.940]  I sued the IRS in one, I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since
[3:17:38.940 --> 3:17:44.940]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved
[3:17:44.940 --> 3:17:45.940]  I can help you too
[3:17:45.940 --> 3:17:48.940]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day
[3:17:48.940 --> 3:17:50.940]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case

[3:18:25.940 --> 3:18:31.940]  It's back in stock at infowarstore.com, discounted because of the COVID lockdown
[3:18:31.940 --> 3:18:35.940]  Because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America

[3:18:41.940 --> 3:18:46.940]  Infowarstore.com and Dr. JonesNaturals.com

[3:18:59.940 --> 3:19:06.940]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told
[3:19:06.940 --> 3:19:10.940]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses
[3:19:10.940 --> 3:19:13.940]  Which is why fluoridated water is a big problem
[3:19:13.940 --> 3:19:20.940]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[3:19:20.940 --> 3:19:23.940]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia
[3:19:23.940 --> 3:19:26.940]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system
[3:19:26.940 --> 3:19:29.940]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye
[3:19:29.940 --> 3:19:32.940]  Also described as the seat of the soul
[3:19:32.940 --> 3:19:36.940]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[3:19:36.940 --> 3:19:39.940]  And otherwise unseen dimensions of reality
[3:19:39.940 --> 3:19:44.940]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy
[3:19:44.940 --> 3:19:50.940]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free
[3:19:50.940 --> 3:19:53.940]  And the propure shower head will seal the deal
[3:19:53.940 --> 3:20:10.940]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com
[3:20:10.940 --> 3:20:28.940]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[3:20:28.940 --> 3:20:36.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente
[3:20:36.940 --> 3:20:41.940]  Hey great being on the Alex Jones show in this very sad times you know the COVID war
[3:20:41.940 --> 3:20:44.940]  And of course now the Afghan war
[3:20:44.940 --> 3:20:47.940]  This is old news what's going on
[3:20:47.940 --> 3:20:52.940]  This is from a trends journal back in 2014
[3:20:52.940 --> 3:20:55.940]  I launched Occupy Pieces as you can see
[3:20:55.940 --> 3:21:03.940]  And there's an article down here at the bottom from USA Today
[3:21:03.940 --> 3:21:06.940]  I used to run my top trends every year
[3:21:06.940 --> 3:21:12.940]  And this is from December 12, 2000
[3:21:12.940 --> 3:21:18.940]  We come out with our trends for the new year in December for January
[3:21:18.940 --> 3:21:24.940]  2000 will not be our year trends here says
[3:21:24.940 --> 3:21:29.940]  A wave of anti-Americanism will sweep the globe
[3:21:29.940 --> 3:21:34.940]  And I warned that Americans wouldn't be safe at home or abroad
[3:21:34.940 --> 3:21:39.940]  I knew this was going to happen whether it was 9-11 or something else
[3:21:39.940 --> 3:21:45.940]  People forget the murderous acts of America throughout the 1990s
[3:21:45.940 --> 3:21:51.940]  Especially with George Bush seniors war, the first Iraq war, the Gulf war
[3:21:51.940 --> 3:21:57.940]  And then Bill Clinton every time he got caught with his pants down, bombs away over Baghdad
[3:21:57.940 --> 3:22:01.940]  And you could go and you could look it up yourself, Madeleine all bright
[3:22:01.940 --> 3:22:05.940]  Well, Madeleine not all that bright, Madeleine arrogant bright
[3:22:05.940 --> 3:22:10.940]  There's a whole nother story, I was on the QE2 where there was keynote speakers
[3:22:10.940 --> 3:22:13.940]  Back in 2002, but that's a whole nother story
[3:22:13.940 --> 3:22:17.940]  It was like being with the Queen of Tarts, big chuch
[3:22:17.940 --> 3:22:25.940]  Anyway, she's asked by Leslie Stahl on CBS if Bill Clinton's sanctions on Iraq
[3:22:25.940 --> 3:22:31.940]  Remember, this is before the Iraq war was officially launched by George W. Bush Jr
[3:22:31.940 --> 3:22:34.940]  The daddy's boy born on third base and 30 at a home run
[3:22:34.940 --> 3:22:38.940]  Little arrogant, nothing of a clown that people listen to
[3:22:38.940 --> 3:22:45.940]  He put sanctions on Iraq that killed over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of 5
[3:22:45.940 --> 3:22:53.940]  And Madeleine all bright asked is the price of the sanctions worth it by Leslie Stahl
[3:22:53.940 --> 3:22:57.940]  And Madeleine all bright said yes it is
[3:22:57.940 --> 3:23:03.940]  And then of course there's the, what's going on in Israel with the Palestinians
[3:23:03.940 --> 3:23:06.940]  And Bill Clinton's wars against Kosovo that's thawed it
[3:23:06.940 --> 3:23:09.940]  It's Serbia didn't want to join the EU
[3:23:09.940 --> 3:23:11.940]  And Madeleine not all that bright
[3:23:11.940 --> 3:23:14.940]  Look at her, what a chuch
[3:23:14.940 --> 3:23:20.940]  Arrogant, arrogant, I'll tell you another story sometime
[3:23:20.940 --> 3:23:26.940]  Anyway, so I saw this coming
[3:23:26.940 --> 3:23:31.940]  So now all the media's calling me up and saying, how'd you know this was going to happen
[3:23:31.940 --> 3:23:34.940]  I should be kidding, I said payback's a bitch
[3:23:34.940 --> 3:23:38.940]  And people are forgetting who was behind this
[3:23:38.940 --> 3:23:45.940]  Allegedly, again if the 9-11 story is true and I'm not saying it is, allegedly if it is
[3:23:45.940 --> 3:23:51.940]  What were 15 of the so-called terrorists Saudis
[3:23:51.940 --> 3:24:00.940]  And who was the slime ball that brought in and financed Al Qaeda, Jimmy Carter
[3:24:00.940 --> 3:24:07.940]  To bring them into Afghanistan so they would get the Russians out of there in the 90s
[3:24:07.940 --> 3:24:18.940]  You forget about that, excuse me in the 90s, in the 1970s and into the 80s
[3:24:18.940 --> 3:24:21.940]  Jimmy Carter was the guy that did it
[3:24:21.940 --> 3:24:25.940]  Osama bin Laden were all Saudis
[3:24:25.940 --> 3:24:28.940]  So now I got black ball from everybody
[3:24:28.940 --> 3:24:33.940]  I used to be on Oprah the Today Show, Good Morning America, on and on
[3:24:33.940 --> 3:24:38.940]  When I said they asked me what will happen with the Afghan war
[3:24:38.940 --> 3:24:43.940]  I said listen, if Alexander the Great couldn't pull it off
[3:24:43.940 --> 3:24:53.940]  If into the valley of death, row the 600, the British couldn't pull it off at the height of the British empire
[3:24:53.940 --> 3:24:56.940]  The Americans aren't going to pull it off
[3:24:56.940 --> 3:24:58.940]  They lost the Vietnam War
[3:24:58.940 --> 3:25:04.940]  Oh yeah, but if we killed more than 3 million people we would have won, and if we sprayed more Agent Orange we would have killed them
[3:25:04.940 --> 3:25:06.940]  No you wouldn't
[3:25:06.940 --> 3:25:08.940]  People don't like being occupied
[3:25:08.940 --> 3:25:15.940]  No you don't call them terrorists, you call them freedom fighters if you're in that country
[3:25:15.940 --> 3:25:21.940]  We were writing about the Taliban, how they took over the country on and on before this ever happened
[3:25:21.940 --> 3:25:24.940]  In detail
[3:25:24.940 --> 3:25:32.940]  When the United States and Saudi Arabia and the Allies wanted the Russians out of there
[3:25:32.940 --> 3:25:36.940]  Afghanistan was becoming a very advanced place
[3:25:36.940 --> 3:25:39.940]  Before this happened
[3:25:39.940 --> 3:25:44.940]  So now going back
[3:25:44.940 --> 3:25:48.940]  I launched Occupy Peace
[3:25:48.940 --> 3:25:51.940]  Because we had no business being there
[3:25:51.940 --> 3:25:55.940]  And one of the trends journal covers
[3:25:55.940 --> 3:26:01.940]  Back in 2020 when everybody was signing up for the COVID war
[3:26:01.940 --> 3:26:05.940]  Was dumb enough to believe Bush's wars
[3:26:05.940 --> 3:26:08.940]  Dumb enough to believe the COVID war
[3:26:08.940 --> 3:26:11.940]  How could anybody with a brain bigger than a pea
[3:26:11.940 --> 3:26:14.940]  Listen to a little piece of crap
[3:26:14.940 --> 3:26:20.940]  A little arrogant nobody boy if daddy was in Georgie Bush and Prescott Bush before him
[3:26:20.940 --> 3:26:22.940]  Sending the Americans to war
[3:26:22.940 --> 3:26:26.940]  We're going to get that guy Osama bin Laden dead or alive
[3:26:26.940 --> 3:26:28.940]  I'm not making that up
[3:26:28.940 --> 3:26:36.940]  88% of the Americans swallowed the crap spewing out of that crap heads mouth
[3:26:36.940 --> 3:26:38.940]  Just like they buy the COVID war
[3:26:38.940 --> 3:26:40.940]  Just like they bought the Vietnam
[3:26:40.940 --> 3:26:43.940]  Hey we had those commies they're going to take over
[3:26:43.940 --> 3:26:46.940]  They're going to take over the world if we don't stop them
[3:26:46.940 --> 3:26:48.940]  Domino's are going to be falling
[3:26:48.940 --> 3:26:50.940]  Oh yeah now they're one of our biggest trading partners
[3:26:50.940 --> 3:26:52.940]  And they're still commies like Communist China
[3:26:52.940 --> 3:26:54.940]  But that's okay
[3:26:54.940 --> 3:26:57.940]  It's the military industrial complex
[3:26:57.940 --> 3:27:02.940]  Dwight D. Eisenhower five star general supreme commander of the Allied forces warned us about
[3:27:02.940 --> 3:27:06.940]  That they would rob us of our genius of the scientists
[3:27:06.940 --> 3:27:08.940]  Swear to the laborers in the future of the children
[3:27:08.940 --> 3:27:10.940]  Here we are
[3:27:10.940 --> 3:27:12.940]  Look at that little piece of crap
[3:27:12.940 --> 3:27:14.940]  I call him that to his face
[3:27:14.940 --> 3:27:18.940]  Oh and how about this being dumb enough to believe
[3:27:18.940 --> 3:27:20.940]  Dick Cheney
[3:27:20.940 --> 3:27:22.940]  Oh I have to be proper I can't be censored
[3:27:22.940 --> 3:27:24.940]  Penis Cheney
[3:27:24.940 --> 3:27:26.940]  Yeah
[3:27:26.940 --> 3:27:29.940]  How can you be so stupid to listen to these people
[3:27:29.940 --> 3:27:31.940]  It doesn't change
[3:27:31.940 --> 3:27:34.940]  You got B.S. Biden one after another
[3:27:34.940 --> 3:27:36.940]  Crappy qualm all out of here
[3:27:36.940 --> 3:27:38.940]  And you know on info wars
[3:27:38.940 --> 3:27:42.940]  I was the first to call that little slime around
[3:27:42.940 --> 3:27:46.940]  Dumb enough to believe Bush's wars
[3:27:46.940 --> 3:27:48.940]  Dumb enough to believe the COVID war
[3:27:48.940 --> 3:27:53.940]  Just like they hiled Hitler's saluted Stalin and marched off to Mussolini
[3:27:53.940 --> 3:27:57.940]  We have no business being there
[3:27:57.940 --> 3:28:01.940]  We're going to get that guy and again I wrote about this in detail
[3:28:01.940 --> 3:28:05.940]  The Taliban wanted to talk with America
[3:28:05.940 --> 3:28:07.940]  Bush said we have no time to talk
[3:28:07.940 --> 3:28:09.940]  We're not talking
[3:28:09.940 --> 3:28:11.940]  We're taking action
[3:28:11.940 --> 3:28:13.940]  Killing our men, killing innocent people
[3:28:13.940 --> 3:28:15.940]  Destroying the place
[3:28:15.940 --> 3:28:17.940]  On the callers about refugees bringing them into here
[3:28:17.940 --> 3:28:19.940]  You haven't seen anything
[3:28:19.940 --> 3:28:22.940]  They've been flooding into Europe for a long time from Afghanistan
[3:28:22.940 --> 3:28:24.940]  And now more
[3:28:24.940 --> 3:28:26.940]  And coming in from Africa as the COVID war goes down
[3:28:26.940 --> 3:28:29.940]  The economies go down
[3:28:29.940 --> 3:28:32.940]  The refugee crisis is going to be monumental
[3:28:32.940 --> 3:28:34.940]  Because of the COVID war from
[3:28:34.940 --> 3:28:37.940]  You always see the numbers coming from South America
[3:28:37.940 --> 3:28:40.940]  So going back to
[3:28:40.940 --> 3:28:42.940]  Afghanistan
[3:28:42.940 --> 3:28:45.940]  All the facts are here in your Trends Journal
[3:28:45.940 --> 3:28:47.940]  I called it
[3:28:47.940 --> 3:28:49.940]  And I got banned from TV for doing it
[3:28:49.940 --> 3:28:51.940]  I'm an American
[3:28:51.940 --> 3:28:53.940]  I believe in George Washington
[3:28:53.940 --> 3:28:55.940]  No foreign entanglement
[3:28:55.940 --> 3:28:57.940]  We're going to be right back
[3:28:57.940 --> 3:28:59.940]  Stay tuned
[3:28:59.940 --> 3:29:01.940]  You know, listeners call into the cell when they thank me
[3:29:01.940 --> 3:29:04.940]  And it makes me feel pathetic
[3:29:04.940 --> 3:29:07.940]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support
[3:29:07.940 --> 3:29:10.940]  Constantly, for prayer, for financial support
[3:29:10.940 --> 3:29:12.940]  And for word of mouth
[3:29:12.940 --> 3:29:14.940]  And we're all this together
[3:29:14.940 --> 3:29:16.940]  It gets old having to come to you and say
[3:29:16.940 --> 3:29:18.940]  Hey, I got great products, please buy them
[3:29:18.940 --> 3:29:20.940]  Or we won't be here on air
[3:29:20.940 --> 3:29:22.940]  But it's true, we're the only media organization in the United States
[3:29:22.940 --> 3:29:24.940]  That promotes liberty at this level
[3:29:24.940 --> 3:29:26.940]  That is not beholden to big corporate sponsors
[3:29:26.940 --> 3:29:28.940]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else
[3:29:28.940 --> 3:29:30.940]  They crippled all the other groups
[3:29:30.940 --> 3:29:32.940]  And we're still here
[3:29:32.940 --> 3:29:34.940]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open
[3:29:34.940 --> 3:29:36.940]  Our credibility is going up
[3:29:36.940 --> 3:29:38.940]  That's why America has got to be taken down
[3:29:38.940 --> 3:29:40.940]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved
[3:29:40.940 --> 3:29:42.940]  And America is still quasi-free
[3:29:42.940 --> 3:29:44.940]  You can't have info wars has been proven right
[3:29:44.940 --> 3:29:46.940]  Being on air with all the craziness
[3:29:46.940 --> 3:29:48.940]  That's about to unfold
[3:29:48.940 --> 3:29:50.940]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready
[3:29:50.940 --> 3:29:52.940]  So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com

[3:30:01.940 --> 3:30:04.940]  What are champions made of?
[3:30:04.940 --> 3:30:06.940]  Here's a man who can show you
[3:30:34.940 --> 3:30:37.940]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid-1990s
[3:30:37.940 --> 3:30:38.940]  and then imagine the sign
[3:30:38.940 --> 3:30:46.240]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest
[3:30:46.240 --> 3:30:47.940]  Triple A to 533139

[3:30:54.540 --> 3:30:56.140]  Triple A to 533139
[3:30:56.140 --> 3:30:57.940]  Triple A to 533139
[3:30:57.940 --> 3:31:00.140]  That's InfoWarsStore.com
[3:31:00.640 --> 3:31:03.940]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid-1990s
[3:31:03.940 --> 3:31:07.640]  And then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020
[3:31:07.640 --> 3:31:09.340]  Or a world government's being established
[3:31:09.340 --> 3:31:13.540]  Where members of Congress and former presidents are censured by big tech
[3:31:13.540 --> 3:31:18.240]  And where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood clots
[3:31:18.240 --> 3:31:20.640]  And prions all over your body
[3:31:20.640 --> 3:31:24.340]  Then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane
[3:31:24.340 --> 3:31:26.540]  Think about that, because that's where we are
[3:31:26.540 --> 3:31:28.740]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago
[3:31:28.740 --> 3:31:30.140]  Tell us just 5 years ago
[3:31:30.140 --> 3:31:33.440]  If somebody told you this would be happening
[3:31:33.440 --> 3:31:35.440]  But it is happening now
[3:31:35.440 --> 3:31:38.540]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy
[3:31:38.540 --> 3:31:40.040]  And it doesn't really work
[3:31:40.040 --> 3:31:41.940]  So you got to take it every few months
[3:31:41.940 --> 3:31:44.440]  And the people that have submitted say, great
[3:31:44.440 --> 3:31:48.140]  I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID
[3:31:48.140 --> 3:31:49.940]  Even though it gets you sick from COVID
[3:31:49.940 --> 3:31:52.240]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people
[3:31:52.240 --> 3:31:54.840]  From the sloughing, the shedding of the virus
[3:31:54.840 --> 3:31:56.640]  And that's in mainline studies
[3:31:56.640 --> 3:31:58.340]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this
[3:31:58.340 --> 3:32:00.140]  Need to go to prison for it right now
[3:32:01.640 --> 3:32:03.640]  You say you want to fight tyranny
[3:32:03.640 --> 3:32:06.540]  You say you want to fund the Second American Revolution
[3:32:06.540 --> 3:32:08.440]  I know you do, that's why you're here
[3:32:08.440 --> 3:32:12.440]  So I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening right now to understand
[3:32:12.440 --> 3:32:15.740]  That there are really two places in the media that don't back down

[3:33:29.840 --> 3:33:31.840]  Yeah, dude
[3:33:31.840 --> 3:33:34.440]  Great being back on the Alex Jones show
[3:33:34.440 --> 3:33:37.440]  You know, these are very difficult times we're living in
[3:33:37.440 --> 3:33:41.440]  And it's so sad to see where this country is gone
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:43.440]  And how low it's going
[3:33:43.440 --> 3:33:47.440]  You know, going back to the Afghan war
[3:33:47.440 --> 3:33:52.640]  You know, America hasn't won a war since World War II
[3:33:52.640 --> 3:33:56.640]  And again, Dwight D. Eisenhower, five star general
[3:33:56.640 --> 3:33:59.640]  Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces
[3:33:59.640 --> 3:34:02.640]  Two-term president, warned the American people
[3:34:02.640 --> 3:34:03.640]  Warned us
[3:34:03.640 --> 3:34:05.640]  He could look it up
[3:34:05.640 --> 3:34:09.640]  January 17th, 1961
[3:34:09.640 --> 3:34:14.640]  That the military industrial complex was robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists
[3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:17.640]  Swear to the laborers in the future of the children
[3:34:17.640 --> 3:34:21.640]  It's not a war that they don't love
[3:34:21.640 --> 3:34:25.640]  And I love the thing they call and they're pulling out the troops and contractors
[3:34:25.640 --> 3:34:28.640]  Have a mercenary
[3:34:28.640 --> 3:34:31.640]  So, going back to the war
[3:34:31.640 --> 3:34:34.640]  Again, this is from the magazine, The Trends Journal
[3:34:34.640 --> 3:34:37.640]  They made a movie on my book
[3:34:37.640 --> 3:34:41.640]  An independent movie, what Zidzi gave Honey Boy
[3:34:41.640 --> 3:34:46.640]  A true story about love, wisdom, and the soul of America
[3:34:46.640 --> 3:34:49.640]  And the woman that played my aunt
[3:34:49.640 --> 3:34:51.640]  May she rest in peace
[3:34:51.640 --> 3:34:54.640]  Zidzi, Zidzi is the Neapolitan dialect for Auntie
[3:34:54.640 --> 3:34:56.640]  Z is your aunt
[3:34:56.640 --> 3:34:58.640]  And Zidzi is your auntie
[3:34:58.640 --> 3:35:02.640]  Anyway, I'm heartbroken because
[3:35:02.640 --> 3:35:06.640]  I'm a visionary and I see the future
[3:35:06.640 --> 3:35:08.640]  That's what I do for a living
[3:35:08.640 --> 3:35:10.640]  And I see where this country is going
[3:35:10.640 --> 3:35:16.640]  Doris Roberts, who used to play the mother in that TV series
[3:35:16.640 --> 3:35:17.640]  Everyone Loves Raymond
[3:35:17.640 --> 3:35:20.640]  That was the last starring role playing in my book
[3:35:20.640 --> 3:35:24.640]  That she played in my book, she died 15 minutes into the movie
[3:35:24.640 --> 3:35:27.640]  You can get it on Amazon
[3:35:27.640 --> 3:35:30.640]  And it goes, this is how the story begins
[3:35:30.640 --> 3:35:36.640]  George W. Bush swiftly sends the U.S. military to invade and occupy Afghanistan
[3:35:36.640 --> 3:35:38.640]  And then nation rallies around him
[3:35:38.640 --> 3:35:42.640]  With some 90% of the people hailed to the chief
[3:35:42.640 --> 3:35:44.640]  With American flags flying everywhere
[3:35:44.640 --> 3:35:47.640]  And yellow ribbons tied to everything
[3:35:47.640 --> 3:35:54.640]  I refuse to join the masses in the march to war
[3:35:54.640 --> 3:36:01.640]  I knew it would be disastrous to the nation and the world
[3:36:01.640 --> 3:36:08.640]  But for the mindset of the nation, it was in a different place
[3:36:08.640 --> 3:36:10.640]  I was blackballed by the media
[3:36:10.640 --> 3:36:14.640]  And at the time when President Bush warned anyone
[3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:18.640]  Who would not support his war, that quote
[3:36:18.640 --> 3:36:20.640]  You are with us
[3:36:20.640 --> 3:36:24.640]  Who or you are with the terrorists
[3:36:24.640 --> 3:36:27.640]  Can you imagine this little piece of crap
[3:36:27.640 --> 3:36:29.640]  Speaking that to my face
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:34.640]  This stupid, moronic, low-down piece of crap
[3:36:34.640 --> 3:36:38.640]  This disgusting, war-mongering slimeball
[3:36:38.640 --> 3:36:43.640]  Calling me a person that supports the terrorists
[3:36:43.640 --> 3:36:50.640]  And boy did I pay for it
[3:36:50.640 --> 3:36:54.640]  I was also accused of being anti-American
[3:36:54.640 --> 3:36:58.640]  Because I predicted the Afghan war would end in defeat
[3:36:58.640 --> 3:37:02.640]  Hey, remember the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner
[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:05.640]  Barack Obama
[3:37:05.640 --> 3:37:12.640]  That all those ignorant, stupid people believed is folks
[3:37:12.640 --> 3:37:15.640]  No, folks, yeah
[3:37:15.640 --> 3:37:18.640]  Believed them faking us all the time
[3:37:18.640 --> 3:37:22.640]  That everything was going to change
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:24.640]  The peace candidate
[3:37:24.640 --> 3:37:28.640]  Remember his troops surge in Afghanistan
[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:32.640]  33,000 troops, great job
[3:37:32.640 --> 3:37:36.640]  Yeah, look at the losers
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:39.640]  Look at the losers
[3:37:39.640 --> 3:37:41.640]  Arrogance
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:44.640]  Hope and change you can believe in
[3:37:44.640 --> 3:37:47.640]  Yeah, change of a penny
[3:37:47.640 --> 3:37:50.640]  And how the people love that war monger
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:54.640]  Look what he did to Libya
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:37:56.640]  I want that guy Gaddafi out of there
[3:37:56.640 --> 3:37:58.640]  So destroy the richest country in Africa
[3:37:58.640 --> 3:38:01.640]  I want the oil
[3:38:01.640 --> 3:38:03.640]  I want that guy who sought out of there
[3:38:03.640 --> 3:38:06.640]  Great tourist destination, Syria gone
[3:38:06.640 --> 3:38:08.640]  Destroyed Obama
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:11.640]  Going back to this
[3:38:11.640 --> 3:38:16.640]  Now, 12 years later, again, this was 2014
[3:38:16.640 --> 3:38:20.640]  Having further deteriorated economically, military and morally
[3:38:20.640 --> 3:38:23.640]  America has gone from bad to worse
[3:38:23.640 --> 3:38:25.640]  Republican and Democrat
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:28.640]  Whoever is in charge makes little difference
[3:38:28.640 --> 3:38:30.640]  America put a dunce in the White House
[3:38:30.640 --> 3:38:32.640]  Who launched the war on terror
[3:38:32.640 --> 3:38:36.640]  That has killed millions and destroyed entire nations
[3:38:36.640 --> 3:38:39.640]  Then replaced him with a fraud
[3:38:39.640 --> 3:38:43.640]  Who has bombed seven countries in six years
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:46.640]  And just launched Crusades 2000
[3:38:46.640 --> 3:38:48.640]  The war against the Islamic State
[3:38:48.640 --> 3:38:51.640]  That's Obama
[3:38:51.640 --> 3:38:53.640]  A dunce or a fraud
[3:38:53.640 --> 3:38:55.640]  An empty mind or an empty suit
[3:38:55.640 --> 3:38:58.640]  Be they male, female, gay, straight
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:01.640]  Whatever creed or color, it doesn't matter
[3:39:01.640 --> 3:39:04.640]  Psychologists have a name for them
[3:39:04.640 --> 3:39:08.640]  And psychiatrists have a diagnosis for their mental illness
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:11.640]  That infects these political parasites
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:14.640]  Yet despite their unbroken track records
[3:39:14.640 --> 3:39:17.640]  Of monumental failures, outright lies
[3:39:17.640 --> 3:39:21.640]  Acts of murder, high crimes and ongoing misdemeanors
[3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:25.640]  The majority still swallows the cheap lines
[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:27.640]  Applauses their bad acts
[3:39:27.640 --> 3:39:31.640]  And defends their criminal actions
[3:39:31.640 --> 3:39:35.640]  How many more wars does Washington have to start
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:38.640]  And how much more money will they let Wall Street steal
[3:39:38.640 --> 3:39:42.640]  Before Americans have the courage to call
[3:39:42.640 --> 3:39:44.640]  A spade a spade
[3:39:44.640 --> 3:39:50.640]  And look down upon those who rule them
[3:39:50.640 --> 3:39:54.640]  So again, this is old news
[3:39:54.640 --> 3:39:57.640]  And now you're hearing these generals say
[3:39:57.640 --> 3:40:01.640]  We need more military and we need more money
[3:40:01.640 --> 3:40:03.640]  To fight China
[3:40:03.640 --> 3:40:08.640]  Hey, you couldn't beat Afghanistan
[3:40:08.640 --> 3:40:11.640]  You lost Vietnam
[3:40:11.640 --> 3:40:15.640]  You just turned Libya into a hellhole
[3:40:15.640 --> 3:40:17.640]  Or you're going to defend China
[3:40:17.640 --> 3:40:19.640]  When they go to take back Taiwan
[3:40:19.640 --> 3:40:22.640]  No way, no how
[3:40:22.640 --> 3:40:27.640]  The only way it'll happen is if all out war happens
[3:40:27.640 --> 3:40:30.640]  And that will be the war that Einstein
[3:40:30.640 --> 3:40:33.640]  Who knew a little thing about weapons when they asked him
[3:40:33.640 --> 3:40:37.640]  What kind of weaponry will be used to fight the third world war
[3:40:37.640 --> 3:40:40.640]  And he said, I don't know
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:44.640]  But they'll be using sticks and stones to fight the fourth
[3:40:47.640 --> 3:40:49.640]  I am an American
[3:40:49.640 --> 3:40:53.640]  I believe in the founding fathers, George Washington
[3:40:53.640 --> 3:40:55.640]  A real man
[3:40:55.640 --> 3:40:58.640]  Hey, remember crossing the Delaware fighting our independence
[3:40:58.640 --> 3:41:00.640]  Not like these little clown boys
[3:41:00.640 --> 3:41:02.640]  Like a B.S. Biden
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:04.640]  Like a ballist Obama
[3:41:04.640 --> 3:41:06.640]  Like a piece of crab bush
[3:41:06.640 --> 3:41:08.640]  Like a slimy Clinton
[3:41:08.640 --> 3:41:10.640]  Like a nobody Nixon
[3:41:10.640 --> 3:41:12.640]  A cowardly Carter
[3:41:12.640 --> 3:41:15.640]  No, a real man
[3:41:15.640 --> 3:41:17.640]  Wanting us
[3:41:17.640 --> 3:41:20.640]  No foreign entanglements
[3:41:20.640 --> 3:41:22.640]  From the founding fathers
[3:41:22.640 --> 3:41:26.640]  And now I got these same pieces of presidential crap
[3:41:26.640 --> 3:41:29.640]  From the founding fathers who fought for our freedom
[3:41:29.640 --> 3:41:33.640]  And gave us this country destroying the Constitution
[3:41:33.640 --> 3:41:35.640]  Destroying the Bill of Rights
[3:41:35.640 --> 3:41:39.640]  And telling us we have to follow them
[3:41:39.640 --> 3:41:41.640]  Follow your leader
[3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:44.640]  In what country are you talking about?
[3:41:44.640 --> 3:41:47.640]  It's a global freak show
[3:41:47.640 --> 3:41:50.640]  Right in front of our eyes
[3:41:53.640 --> 3:41:56.640]  If we don't stand up
[3:41:56.640 --> 3:42:00.640]  United we stand divided we fall
[3:42:00.640 --> 3:42:03.640]  We occupy peace
[3:42:03.640 --> 3:42:06.640]  Bring home all the troops from the 800 bases
[3:42:09.640 --> 3:42:12.640]  Yeah, secure the homeland
[3:42:12.640 --> 3:42:15.640]  Nobody coming in without being invited in
[3:42:15.640 --> 3:42:17.640]  Use the troops for that
[3:42:17.640 --> 3:42:20.640]  Use them to rebuild our rotted infrastructure
[3:42:20.640 --> 3:42:22.640]  And you want to go to war?
[3:42:22.640 --> 3:42:24.640]  Let the people vote
[3:42:24.640 --> 3:42:26.640]  I don't need some little piece of garbage
[3:42:26.640 --> 3:42:28.640]  Crap like a McConnell
[3:42:28.640 --> 3:42:29.640]  Like a Pelosi
[3:42:29.640 --> 3:42:31.640]  Like a Feinstein
[3:42:31.640 --> 3:42:33.640]  Like a little Lindsay
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:35.640]  Did you come out in a closet yet gray
[3:42:35.640 --> 3:42:37.640]  And voting to go to war for me
[3:42:37.640 --> 3:42:39.640]  We the people of the United States decide
[3:42:39.640 --> 3:42:41.640]  That's occupied peace
[3:42:41.640 --> 3:42:43.640]  Put your money where your heart is
[3:42:43.640 --> 3:42:45.640]  Because it's going to get worse if you don't
[3:42:45.640 --> 3:42:47.640]  It's going to get worse if you don't
[3:42:47.640 --> 3:42:49.640]  Because when all else sails they take you to war
[3:42:49.640 --> 3:42:51.640]  Just like Bush took us to war
[3:42:51.640 --> 3:42:54.640]  On 9-11 when the dot-com bus happened
[3:42:54.640 --> 3:43:14.640]  It's going to happen again
[3:43:25.640 --> 3:43:27.640]  We are brothers and sisters together
[3:43:27.640 --> 3:43:30.640]  And it has just been an incredible experience
[3:43:30.640 --> 3:43:32.640]  To work with you over the years
[3:43:32.640 --> 3:43:34.640]  And as crazy as things are
[3:43:34.640 --> 3:43:36.640]  I want to keep working into the future
[3:43:36.640 --> 3:43:38.640]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God
[3:43:38.640 --> 3:43:41.640]  So please, I hope God works through you
[3:43:41.640 --> 3:43:44.640]  And puts a message in your heart to support us
[3:43:44.640 --> 3:43:46.640]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God
[3:43:46.640 --> 3:43:48.640]  I just want to thank you all for the years
[3:43:48.640 --> 3:43:50.640]  Of support you've given us and what you've done
[3:43:50.640 --> 3:43:52.640]  And just ask you again to pray to God
[3:43:52.640 --> 3:43:54.640]  And ask what God's vision is for you
[3:43:54.640 --> 3:43:56.640]  And hopefully God will touch your heart
[3:43:56.640 --> 3:43:58.640]  To continue to support Him for worse
[3:43:58.640 --> 3:44:23.640]  So when I first started taking survival shield
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:28.640]  I went from brain fog to literally my brain was enlightened
[3:44:28.640 --> 3:44:31.640]  I could think again, I could connect with people again
[3:44:31.640 --> 3:44:34.640]  And over the course of the next couple of years
[3:44:34.640 --> 3:44:36.640]  I got my health back and I religiously take
[3:44:36.640 --> 3:44:38.640]  Basically all of your supplements
[3:44:38.640 --> 3:44:40.640]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements
[3:44:40.640 --> 3:44:42.640]  The one I like recently is knockout
[3:44:42.640 --> 3:44:44.640]  Literally, like if you want to sleep just take it
[3:44:44.640 --> 3:44:45.640]  It's amazing, it works
[3:44:45.640 --> 3:44:48.640]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[3:44:48.640 --> 3:44:50.640]  That's a break free of the globalist system
[3:44:50.640 --> 3:44:53.640]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[3:44:53.640 --> 3:44:54.640]  Into our own hand
[3:44:54.640 --> 3:44:55.640]  Beautifully said, brother
[3:44:55.640 --> 3:45:21.640]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed
[3:45:21.640 --> 3:45:26.640]  Let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end
[3:45:26.640 --> 3:45:28.640]  So please pray for us and please buy the products
[3:45:28.640 --> 3:45:30.640]  And then fullwarestore.com
[3:45:30.640 --> 3:45:32.640]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation
[3:45:32.640 --> 3:45:34.640]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy
[3:45:34.640 --> 3:45:35.640]  They're still great
[3:45:35.640 --> 3:45:36.640]  Do they fund freedom?
[3:45:36.640 --> 3:45:37.640]  No, a lot of them don't
[3:45:37.640 --> 3:45:39.640]  These are great products that fund freedom
[3:45:39.640 --> 3:45:41.640]  And fund justice
[3:45:41.640 --> 3:45:43.640]  When the whole world's waking up and looking for truth
[3:45:43.640 --> 3:45:45.640]  That's why the globalists are censoring
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:47.640]  They can't bring in all this tyranny
[3:45:47.640 --> 3:45:49.640]  And leave people like us on the air
[3:45:49.640 --> 3:45:51.640]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us
[3:45:51.640 --> 3:45:52.640]  And spread the word
[3:45:52.640 --> 3:45:54.640]  Download everything we've done
[3:45:54.640 --> 3:45:55.640]  You can find and save it
[3:45:55.640 --> 3:45:57.640]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[3:45:57.640 --> 3:46:00.640]  And the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[3:46:00.640 --> 3:46:04.640]  The first time I heard the speech
[3:46:04.640 --> 3:46:07.640]  The first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt
[3:46:07.640 --> 3:46:09.640]  I was in sixth grade
[3:46:09.640 --> 3:46:11.640]  And we had this history teacher
[3:46:11.640 --> 3:46:14.640]  That had us write a paper on the man in the arena
[3:46:14.640 --> 3:46:16.640]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying
[3:46:16.640 --> 3:46:18.640]  I want to be the man in the arena
[3:46:18.640 --> 3:46:19.640]  But when it comes to media
[3:46:19.640 --> 3:46:21.640]  Info Wars has been the tip of that spear
[3:46:21.640 --> 3:46:23.640]  But Mike Lindell has come along
[3:46:23.640 --> 3:46:26.640]  And done just as good a job as we've done
[3:46:26.640 --> 3:46:28.640]  Maybe even better when it comes to election fraud
[3:46:28.640 --> 3:46:29.640]  And other issues
[3:46:29.640 --> 3:46:31.640]  And that's why if you go to MyPillow.com

[3:46:55.640 --> 3:46:58.640]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex

[3:47:33.640 --> 3:47:36.640]  And, you know, we're in very difficult times
[3:47:36.640 --> 3:47:38.640]  And you really have to unite, as I said
[3:47:38.640 --> 3:47:40.640]  United we stand, divided we fall
[3:47:40.640 --> 3:47:44.640]  And one of the ways you unite is by supporting Info Wars
[3:47:44.640 --> 3:47:46.640]  It's not like you're giving money away for nothing

[3:48:01.640 --> 3:48:02.640]  Heavy and hard
[3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:05.640]  So they have these natural defenses
[3:48:05.640 --> 3:48:10.640]  And because of the slow destruction of the supply chain
[3:48:10.640 --> 3:48:13.640]  And they're having to end some of the flash sales
[3:48:13.640 --> 3:48:15.640]  That they've been running for over the last week

[3:48:18.640 --> 3:48:19.640]  Natural defenses

[3:49:39.640 --> 3:49:41.640]  We stand divided, we fall
[3:49:41.640 --> 3:49:43.640]  And again, we put out the magazine
[3:49:43.640 --> 3:49:45.640]  The Trends Journal, I just read to you
[3:49:45.640 --> 3:49:48.640]  That's what it used to be, a quarterly
[3:49:48.640 --> 3:49:50.640]  I wrote that back then
[3:49:50.640 --> 3:49:53.640]  In 2014, and now history is right here
[3:49:53.640 --> 3:49:56.640]  History before it happens, now it's a weekly
[3:49:56.640 --> 3:49:58.640]  140-something pages on average
[3:49:58.640 --> 3:50:00.640]  Every week, no ads
[3:50:00.640 --> 3:50:03.640]  Anyway, going back
[3:50:03.640 --> 3:50:06.640]  To George W. Bush calling the war
[3:50:06.640 --> 3:50:09.640]  Against Afghanistan
[3:50:09.640 --> 3:50:12.640]  It followed the dot-com bus
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:16.640]  People forget this, oh, and this is a fact
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:20.640]  Trends Journal, the first only
[3:50:20.640 --> 3:50:23.640]  Identify the almost exact date
[3:50:23.640 --> 3:50:26.640]  Of the dot-com bus in October
[3:50:26.640 --> 3:50:30.640]  1999 issue
[3:50:30.640 --> 3:50:34.640]  October, November, December, January
[3:50:34.640 --> 3:50:37.640]  February, March
[3:50:37.640 --> 3:50:41.640]  In October in 1999
[3:50:41.640 --> 3:50:43.640]  We forecast the dot-com bus
[3:50:43.640 --> 3:50:45.640]  By the second quarter of 2000
[3:50:45.640 --> 3:50:47.640]  It busted in March
[3:50:47.640 --> 3:50:50.640]  The nation was going into a severe recession
[3:50:50.640 --> 3:50:52.640]  People couldn't stand Bush
[3:50:52.640 --> 3:50:54.640]  He had just got elected
[3:50:54.640 --> 3:50:57.640]  His popularity was going below 50%
[3:50:57.640 --> 3:50:59.640]  When he launched the war
[3:50:59.640 --> 3:51:01.640]  It went over to 90%
[3:51:01.640 --> 3:51:03.640]  That's right
[3:51:03.640 --> 3:51:07.640]  80, excuse me, 80 to 90%
[3:51:07.640 --> 3:51:09.640]  How could anybody believe this
[3:51:09.640 --> 3:51:11.640]  Stupid, moronic little piece of crap
[3:51:11.640 --> 3:51:14.640]  And they did
[3:51:14.640 --> 3:51:18.640]  When all else fails, they take you to war
[3:51:18.640 --> 3:51:21.640]  And that's what's going to happen next
[3:51:21.640 --> 3:51:24.640]  Because the markets are going to fail big time
[3:51:24.640 --> 3:51:28.640]  And we're forecasting, get ready for a bouncy October
[3:51:28.640 --> 3:51:31.640]  This October could be the crash
[3:51:31.640 --> 3:51:33.640]  Again, they've been doing it forever
[3:51:33.640 --> 3:51:35.640]  There was a thing called the Great Depression
[3:51:35.640 --> 3:51:37.640]  Oh, what followed, a World War, what?
[3:51:37.640 --> 3:51:39.640]  Yeah
[3:51:39.640 --> 3:51:41.640]  Same thing was going on in the early 1900s
[3:51:41.640 --> 3:51:44.640]  It was a banking bust
[3:51:44.640 --> 3:51:49.640]  And that murderous low life may he rot in hell
[3:51:49.640 --> 3:51:53.640]  What's his name there?
[3:51:53.640 --> 3:51:57.640]  Woodrow Wilson
[3:51:57.640 --> 3:51:59.640]  Who brought us the Federal Reserve
[3:51:59.640 --> 3:52:01.640]  Got America into World War I
[3:52:01.640 --> 3:52:06.640]  I'm a Yankee doodle dandy, yeah, great
[3:52:06.640 --> 3:52:08.640]  We have freaks running the show
[3:52:08.640 --> 3:52:09.640]  In a country near you
[3:52:09.640 --> 3:52:11.640]  Let's take a look around the world
[3:52:11.640 --> 3:52:13.640]  They're locking down Australia again
[3:52:13.640 --> 3:52:17.640]  You have under a thousand deaths
[3:52:17.640 --> 3:52:19.640]  A thousand deaths under
[3:52:19.640 --> 3:52:22.640]  It's like 900 and something
[3:52:22.640 --> 3:52:26.640]  In 17 months
[3:52:26.640 --> 3:52:29.640]  And who's running the show over there?
[3:52:29.640 --> 3:52:32.640]  Premier Danny Andrews
[3:52:32.640 --> 3:52:34.640]  You look at this little clown
[3:52:34.640 --> 3:52:36.640]  This little Danny Andrews
[3:52:36.640 --> 3:52:39.640]  A nothing of a boy
[3:52:39.640 --> 3:52:42.640]  You look at the other premier over there
[3:52:42.640 --> 3:52:45.640]  Gladda's been jerking around
[3:52:45.640 --> 3:52:47.640]  A clown
[3:52:47.640 --> 3:52:49.640]  You look at who's the governors
[3:52:49.640 --> 3:52:54.640]  In this state of America
[3:52:54.640 --> 3:52:56.640]  The jerk they got down there
[3:52:56.640 --> 3:52:59.640]  In Maryland
[3:52:59.640 --> 3:53:02.640]  Big round guy
[3:53:02.640 --> 3:53:04.640]  Whitlist Whitmia
[3:53:04.640 --> 3:53:08.640]  Gruesome Gavin Newsom
[3:53:08.640 --> 3:53:12.640]  Dwayne in Ohio
[3:53:12.640 --> 3:53:14.640]  Just got rid of Cuomo
[3:53:14.640 --> 3:53:16.640]  You got that little boy Macron
[3:53:16.640 --> 3:53:17.640]  Over there in France
[3:53:17.640 --> 3:53:20.640]  A nothing of a clown
[3:53:20.640 --> 3:53:21.640]  Merkel
[3:53:21.640 --> 3:53:23.640]  Look at the people
[3:53:23.640 --> 3:53:25.640]  They have faces
[3:53:25.640 --> 3:53:29.640]  How can you take orders from these people?
[3:53:29.640 --> 3:53:31.640]  Kyle Hitler
[3:53:31.640 --> 3:53:33.640]  March to Mussolini
[3:53:33.640 --> 3:53:35.640]  Salute Stalin
[3:53:35.640 --> 3:53:38.640]  Look at them
[3:53:38.640 --> 3:53:39.640]  Arrogant
[3:53:39.640 --> 3:53:41.640]  Arrogant little nothing
[3:53:41.640 --> 3:53:44.640]  The clown they got up there in Canada
[3:53:44.640 --> 3:53:46.640]  True dope
[3:53:46.640 --> 3:53:47.640]  Another daddy's boy
[3:53:47.640 --> 3:53:52.640]  Born on third base in 30 at a home run
[3:53:52.640 --> 3:53:56.640]  Got a lot here
[3:53:56.640 --> 3:53:58.640]  This is from CNBC
[3:53:58.640 --> 3:54:05.640]  Didn't make the news that came out last week
[3:54:05.640 --> 3:54:07.640]  Now maybe this isn't from CNBC
[3:54:07.640 --> 3:54:08.640]  It's another one
[3:54:08.640 --> 3:54:10.640]  Oh this is CNBC
[3:54:10.640 --> 3:54:12.640]  Uncertainty is back on Main Street
[3:54:12.640 --> 3:54:16.640]  As Delta variant rattles reopening
[3:54:16.640 --> 3:54:18.640]  The economy's going down big
[3:54:18.640 --> 3:54:19.640]  Where I am
[3:54:19.640 --> 3:54:22.640]  I don't like being here anymore
[3:54:22.640 --> 3:54:24.640]  You got to wear masks in a lot of places
[3:54:24.640 --> 3:54:26.640]  People are freaking out
[3:54:26.640 --> 3:54:29.640]  The streets are empty at night
[3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:31.640]  Empty
[3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:33.640]  Nine o'clock
[3:54:33.640 --> 3:54:37.640]  Hardly a car on the road
[3:54:37.640 --> 3:54:39.640]  A lot of offices are telling people
[3:54:39.640 --> 3:54:41.640]  They have to be vaccinated
[3:54:41.640 --> 3:54:42.640]  Others are saying
[3:54:42.640 --> 3:54:43.640]  You don't have to come to work
[3:54:43.640 --> 3:54:44.640]  You can work at home
[3:54:44.640 --> 3:54:50.640]  That's going to destroy the commercial real estate sector
[3:54:50.640 --> 3:54:54.640]  They're locking down in places around the world
[3:54:54.640 --> 3:54:57.640]  The economy is going to go down big this time
[3:54:57.640 --> 3:55:00.640]  People aren't going to spend like they did the last time
[3:55:00.640 --> 3:55:03.640]  When they were locked up for the first time
[3:55:03.640 --> 3:55:08.640]  Again they're empty the streets
[3:55:08.640 --> 3:55:09.640]  And they're going to get worse
[3:55:09.640 --> 3:55:11.640]  Look at down under over there
[3:55:11.640 --> 3:55:14.640]  Melbourne lockdown extended
[3:55:14.640 --> 3:55:17.640]  As mystery case spikes state of emergency
[3:55:17.640 --> 3:55:22.640]  Mystery case
[3:55:22.640 --> 3:55:24.640]  A mystery case
[3:55:24.640 --> 3:55:26.640]  How many people died?
[3:55:26.640 --> 3:55:28.640]  A couple of people died
[3:55:28.640 --> 3:55:31.640]  And they were over, one was 90
[3:55:31.640 --> 3:55:34.640]  Another one over 70
[3:55:34.640 --> 3:55:37.640]  Yep
[3:55:37.640 --> 3:55:42.640]  Cases
[3:55:42.640 --> 3:55:45.640]  And they're saying that if we don't get vaccinated
[3:55:45.640 --> 3:55:47.640]  Then we have no right having freedom
[3:55:47.640 --> 3:55:51.640]  As we heard from Schwarzenegger
[3:55:51.640 --> 3:55:53.640]  He said screw your freedom
[3:55:53.640 --> 3:56:03.640]  I guess he was listening to his Nazi father
[3:56:03.640 --> 3:56:08.640]  He says we're going down big and hard
[3:56:08.640 --> 3:56:10.640]  Screw your freedom
[3:56:10.640 --> 3:56:12.640]  Yeah, Heil Hitler
[3:56:12.640 --> 3:56:17.640]  Who's this guy to tell me what to do?
[3:56:17.640 --> 3:56:20.640]  That's how stupid the people are
[3:56:20.640 --> 3:56:29.640]  They voted for this clown to be governor of California
[3:56:29.640 --> 3:56:32.640]  All right?
[3:56:32.640 --> 3:56:36.640]  Screw your freedom
[3:56:36.640 --> 3:56:39.640]  You got this little clown boy over there in Australia
[3:56:39.640 --> 3:56:44.640]  Danny Andrews
[3:56:44.640 --> 3:56:46.640]  It's very challenging
[3:56:46.640 --> 3:56:48.640]  I know for every single Victorian
[3:56:48.640 --> 3:56:51.640]  Who would like to be going about their business
[3:56:51.640 --> 3:56:53.640]  They would like to be open
[3:56:53.640 --> 3:56:56.640]  And have a degree of freedom
[3:56:56.640 --> 3:57:00.640]  That is simply not possible
[3:57:00.640 --> 3:57:02.640]  I can't imagine this little clown
[3:57:02.640 --> 3:57:05.640]  Nothing, this little Danny Andrews
[3:57:05.640 --> 3:57:08.640]  Saying that to me face to face
[3:57:08.640 --> 3:57:13.640]  That freedom is not possible
[3:57:13.640 --> 3:57:14.640]  Why, Salenti, calm down
[3:57:14.640 --> 3:57:16.640]  Look at this little clown
[3:57:16.640 --> 3:57:19.640]  How could anybody with a pair of you-know-what
[3:57:19.640 --> 3:57:21.640]  Look at this little jerk
[3:57:21.640 --> 3:57:24.640]  Look at the other one been jerking around
[3:57:24.640 --> 3:57:26.640]  The other premier over there
[3:57:26.640 --> 3:57:29.640]  They got over there in New South Wales
[3:57:29.640 --> 3:57:34.640]  It's one clown show after another
[3:57:34.640 --> 3:57:36.640]  Same thing with Macron
[3:57:36.640 --> 3:57:37.640]  Over there in France
[3:57:37.640 --> 3:57:40.640]  Telling people, no freedom
[3:57:40.640 --> 3:57:44.640]  No freedom
[3:57:44.640 --> 3:57:48.640]  So, support info was
[3:57:48.640 --> 3:57:49.640]  It's up to you
[3:57:49.640 --> 3:57:50.640]  For only one week
