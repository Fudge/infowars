[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.080]  InfoWars! Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide on Saturday afternoon.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.920]  The date is March 27th. The year is 2021. We live on a wondrous planet. We live in an incredible
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:42.720]  universe. We are just now beginning to discover only a tiny percentage of the incredible mysteries
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.680]  that are consciousness. I'm Alex Jones, your host, here with my intrepid crew,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:58.480]  still on air despite all the enemy attacks, thanks to you. The InfoWar is a human struggle against
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.600]  tyranny and those that would shutter the doors of perception, those that would enslave us with lies
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.680]  and disinformation. It was Christ that said, my people perish for lack of knowledge. InfoWars
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.760]  has the knowledge. InfoWars understands the globalist program and InfoWars knows how to stop
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.360]  the New World Order. I've been showing you some really powerful footage here that I know I've been
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.920]  enthralled by of drone footage, live feed footage, and more from Iceland at this volcanic eruption
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.400]  that's captivated the world. And we'll be coming back to that later in the hour and we'll also be
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.960]  looking at the hundreds of ships stranded in the Suez Canal, one simple accident hurtling the world
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.920]  into potential depression. Also constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is going to be joining us
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.960]  to talk about the waterfront, where the Democrats are going, the next moves he thinks Biden and
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.160]  Co are going to pull with their plans to sign executive orders to begin registration and
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.040]  confiscation of firearms and war. That is all coming up as well. We're also going to premiere
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:23.120]  here in just about 15-20 minutes an exclusive piece of research built around my visit
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.520]  just this last Monday to one of the oldest and most powerful secret societies in the world,
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.480]  a branch of that secret society, the Illuminati known as Skull and Bones, the Order of Death,
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.040]  number 322.
[00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:51.447]  And that directly ties to our top story today that I'm about to lay out in great detail.
[00:02:51.447 --> 00:03:00.967]  Here's the headline, Tucker Carlson, US military has gone full woke waging war on those who
[00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:03.967]  disagree with them.
[00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:09.567]  It's a very true statement, and in this world of universal deceit and propaganda, as George
[00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:16.367]  Arwell said, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:22.527]  But as I was just alluding to a moment ago, this system of wokeness, this system that
[00:03:22.527 --> 00:03:28.647]  tells us that Christians and Europeans and white people are inherently evil, are inherently
[00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:34.527]  bad, comes from the establishment, comes from the big banks, comes from the Rothschilds
[00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:36.847]  and the Rockefellers and the British royalty.
[00:03:36.847 --> 00:03:38.927]  It comes out of the universities.
[00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:44.807]  It comes out of Apple and Google and Facebook and Twitter and General Electric.
[00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:51.087]  No corporation of any major size is allowed to operate unless they are wedded to this
[00:03:51.087 --> 00:03:52.087]  plan.
[00:03:52.087 --> 00:03:55.487]  Whether you're in Australia or whether you're in the United States, you hear that white
[00:03:55.487 --> 00:03:57.647]  people are inherently bad.
[00:03:57.647 --> 00:04:04.087]  You hear that men, as half the human species, are inherently evil and must apologize for
[00:04:04.087 --> 00:04:06.047]  our collective sin.
[00:04:06.047 --> 00:04:07.687]  What is behind this?
[00:04:07.687 --> 00:04:09.406]  Who is behind this?
[00:04:09.406 --> 00:04:11.047]  Why are they doing it?
[00:04:11.047 --> 00:04:12.727]  And how do we oppose it?
[00:04:12.727 --> 00:04:17.567]  So I will give you the rest of the story here in just a moment.
[00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:21.667]  But first, let's go to Tucker Carlson's piece from last night, Friday evening.
[00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:27.047]  The full video, 14 minutes long, is posted to Infowars.com, a very important report.
[00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:30.927]  But I'm not taking away from what Tucker lays out here.
[00:04:30.927 --> 00:04:35.167]  But if you don't know the rest of the story, if you don't know who's behind it, why they're
[00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:40.486]  doing it, how it's universal and how it's the establishment pushing this, then we'll
[00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:43.127]  never have any hope of defeating it.
[00:04:43.127 --> 00:04:49.847]  Only by collective awakening to the plan behind this, to end nation states, to end regional
[00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:57.767]  governments, to end cultures, to end all peoples under one corporate transhumanistic plan.
[00:04:57.767 --> 00:04:59.847]  Only by realizing that can we defeat them.
[00:04:59.847 --> 00:05:05.047]  So there is his report, Tucker Carlson, US military has gone full woke, waging war on
[00:05:05.047 --> 00:05:07.047]  those who disagree with them.
[00:05:07.047 --> 00:05:08.047]  Here it is.
[00:05:08.047 --> 00:05:11.847]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight.
[00:05:11.847 --> 00:05:13.167]  Here's an amazing story.
[00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:18.027]  Yesterday, the Pentagon's Special Operations Command made an announcement from its official
[00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:19.647]  Twitter account.
[00:05:19.647 --> 00:05:24.407]  Special Operations Command is a very significant thing in the US military and in our country.
[00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:28.647]  It oversees Delta Force, the SEAL teams, and the rest of our most celebrated, best trained,
[00:05:28.647 --> 00:05:30.727]  most lethal warfighter.
[00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:34.927]  So the tweet announced that a man called Richard Torres Estrada is now the, quote, chief of
[00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:39.687]  diversity and inclusion of America's special forces, and they included his picture with
[00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:40.687]  the announcement.
[00:05:40.687 --> 00:05:45.567]  Then, at the very top of its website, the Special Operations Command included a link
[00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:50.407]  to its extensive, it's quite long, new diversity and inclusion strategic plan.
[00:05:50.407 --> 00:05:55.167]  Now, the one thing we know about that plan is that it will result in the dramatic lowering
[00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:59.087]  of standards within our elite ranks, it probably already has.
[00:05:59.087 --> 00:06:01.007]  So how will that make America safer?
[00:06:01.007 --> 00:06:04.366]  Well, the generals never said you couldn't find that on the website.
[00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:08.407]  Instead, they told us that, quote, all of us understand that diversity and inclusion
[00:06:08.407 --> 00:06:09.727]  are operational imperatives.
[00:06:09.727 --> 00:06:13.547]  They didn't say how, they just said they're imperatives.
[00:06:13.547 --> 00:06:18.106]  So this is the initiative that Richard Torres Estrada will be running.
[00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:21.227]  So the question is, who exactly is Richard Torres Estrada?
[00:06:21.227 --> 00:06:24.667]  Will his Facebook page give some indication of who he is?
[00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:28.267]  On it, you will find an attack on the police as racists.
[00:06:28.267 --> 00:06:30.787]  You'll find crude BLM propaganda.
[00:06:30.787 --> 00:06:35.247]  You will find a photograph of Donald Trump holding a Bible in front of a church.
[00:06:35.247 --> 00:06:38.187]  Next to Trump is a photograph of Adolf Hitler.
[00:06:38.187 --> 00:06:41.547]  The point is, they're the same.
[00:06:41.547 --> 00:06:47.167]  So this is the guy who now oversees hiring for the Navy SEALs.
[00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:51.627]  If you're wondering whether our military leadership has gone woke, you can consider that question
[00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:53.167]  settled for good.
[00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:57.387]  The Pentagon is now the Yale faculty lounge, but with cruise missiles, and that should
[00:06:57.387 --> 00:06:58.787]  concern you.
[00:06:58.787 --> 00:07:02.547]  Meanwhile, the rest of the world rolls on and gets more menacing by the day.
[00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:06.986]  Tonight, for example, the Suez Canal, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world,
[00:07:06.986 --> 00:07:10.147]  is blocked by a stranded container ship.
[00:07:10.147 --> 00:07:11.387]  Was it an accident?
[00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:12.387]  Maybe.
[00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:13.387]  Maybe not.
[00:07:13.387 --> 00:07:14.387]  We don't know.
[00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:16.947]  What we do know is that the Suez Canal is vital to the world's economy.
[00:07:16.947 --> 00:07:18.626]  That's not an overstatement.
[00:07:18.626 --> 00:07:22.787]  The Suez Canal is one of only about a dozen strategic choke points that control virtually
[00:07:22.787 --> 00:07:26.106]  all global trade, and now it's closed.
[00:07:26.106 --> 00:07:30.267]  So this is a challenge to America's critical national interests.
[00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:31.907]  How is the Pentagon responding to that?
[00:07:31.907 --> 00:07:34.907]  Well, they're occupied with other things right now.
[00:07:34.907 --> 00:07:39.087]  For the last month, the entire U.S. military has been operating under a so-called stand-down
[00:07:39.087 --> 00:07:40.087]  order.
[00:07:40.087 --> 00:07:45.287]  This was issued by the new Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, the defense contractor now running
[00:07:45.287 --> 00:07:46.287]  the military.
[00:07:46.287 --> 00:07:50.807]  Lloyd Austin believes the real threat to America is not the Chinese government or paralyzed
[00:07:50.807 --> 00:07:52.647]  global trade.
[00:07:52.647 --> 00:07:56.727]  The real threat to this country is people who didn't vote for Joe Biden.
[00:07:56.727 --> 00:07:57.727]  Watch.
[00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:04.047]  And if confirmed, I will fight hard to stamp out sexual assault and to rid our ranks of
[00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:07.187]  racists and extremists.
[00:08:07.187 --> 00:08:11.746]  The job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies, but we
[00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:17.967]  can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.
[00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:22.727]  So Republicans voted to confirm him, he is himself an extremist, and they have said virtually
[00:08:22.727 --> 00:08:26.927]  nothing about Lloyd Austin since because they're paralyzed.
[00:08:26.927 --> 00:08:32.527]  They're paralyzed because Lloyd Austin has no problem calling his opponents racist immediately,
[00:08:32.527 --> 00:08:36.127]  ridding our ranks of racists and extremists.
[00:08:36.127 --> 00:08:40.707]  The key question is, how does Lloyd Austin define a racist or an extremist?
[00:08:40.707 --> 00:08:42.067]  The definition matters.
[00:08:42.067 --> 00:08:46.507]  This show has been denounced as a dangerous white supremacist organ for the crime of reading
[00:08:46.507 --> 00:08:47.507]  Martin Luther King.
[00:08:47.507 --> 00:08:48.507]  All right, let's hit pause there.
[00:08:48.507 --> 00:08:51.507]  We're going to go back to a few more minutes of this again, the full 14-minute report is
[00:08:51.507 --> 00:08:56.947]  on Infowars.com and Fox Nation and everywhere else, but and everything he's saying is totally
[00:08:56.947 --> 00:08:57.947]  true.
[00:08:57.947 --> 00:09:02.107]  Just the New York Times came out two days ago and said, I should be delisted off Google
[00:09:02.107 --> 00:09:06.027]  completely because I'm a white supremacist.
[00:09:06.027 --> 00:09:11.407]  Now even if I was a white supremacist, that shouldn't happen, but it's not even true.
[00:09:11.407 --> 00:09:13.287]  And then they're the ones that lie about WMDs.
[00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:17.607]  They're the ones that help cover up Obama shipping millions of guns into Syria for giant
[00:09:17.607 --> 00:09:18.607]  civil wars.
[00:09:18.607 --> 00:09:19.607]  I mean, these are really bad people.
[00:09:19.607 --> 00:09:23.247]  These are the folks that cover up for Apple and against slave camps, the worst in the
[00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:25.767]  world in China with the Uighurs and others.
[00:09:25.767 --> 00:09:33.587]  So the wokeness is a cover for their horrible anti-human activity and for levels of slavery
[00:09:33.587 --> 00:09:34.607]  never seen in history.
[00:09:34.627 --> 00:09:36.387]  But that's only part of it.
[00:09:36.387 --> 00:09:40.347]  And Tucker gets into the fact that this is the establishment, this is the elite, this
[00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:42.227]  is their cover for all the bad things they're doing.
[00:09:42.227 --> 00:09:44.187]  But who's behind it?
[00:09:44.187 --> 00:09:45.187]  What's the plan?
[00:09:45.187 --> 00:09:47.507]  Where's it going?
[00:09:47.507 --> 00:09:52.867]  We're going to break more of that down for you in a moment, but let's expand.
[00:09:52.867 --> 00:09:58.367]  General Honore confiscated the guns all over Louisiana and Mississippi, went into high
[00:09:58.367 --> 00:10:01.867]  and dry neighborhoods, they even had electricity and stole people's guns.
[00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:04.347]  They never got them back.
[00:10:05.087 --> 00:10:10.967]  And now he is tasked with creating a new federal authoritarian guard to, quote, wage war on
[00:10:10.967 --> 00:10:17.327]  Trump supporters, which are the largest voting bloc in this country, and we all know it.
[00:10:17.327 --> 00:10:21.287]  Oh, narrowly lost by thousands of votes to Joe Biden, give me a break.
[00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:22.607]  And all that fraud is coming out.
[00:10:22.607 --> 00:10:25.287]  So again, China is about unifying.
[00:10:25.287 --> 00:10:27.727]  If you try to divide China, they execute you.
[00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:28.887]  I'm not saying do that.
[00:10:28.887 --> 00:10:30.767]  We have a right to dissent here.
[00:10:30.787 --> 00:10:35.227]  But our universities, our banks, our media are dividing us on purpose and we have a right
[00:10:35.227 --> 00:10:36.307]  to point that out.
[00:10:36.307 --> 00:10:40.907]  But when we do, we get censored, we get shut down, we lose our bank accounts, we get kicked
[00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:43.707]  off all the platforms.
[00:10:43.707 --> 00:10:49.387]  And now the New York Times and NPR are calling for me to be thrown off my online shopping
[00:10:49.387 --> 00:10:55.707]  cards so I can't even sell products direct to you to stay on air.
[00:10:55.707 --> 00:10:58.607]  So this really is a takeover.
[00:10:58.607 --> 00:11:02.247]  And China's backing it, the globalists are backing it, they want America out of the way,
[00:11:02.247 --> 00:11:07.247]  and they're putting these idiot minions in charge to start a civil war, believing they're
[00:11:07.247 --> 00:11:10.927]  securing their takeover and their power, but really they're just securing the breakup of
[00:11:10.927 --> 00:11:11.927]  the country.
[00:11:11.927 --> 00:11:15.767]  So Tucker sits back and sees all this incompetence and all these terrible things happening and
[00:11:15.767 --> 00:11:17.207]  says these people are incompetent.
[00:11:17.207 --> 00:11:18.607]  He's absolutely right.
[00:11:18.607 --> 00:11:23.247]  But the rest of the equation is who is the group above them?
[00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:27.987]  Well, you see, Tucker's smart, he knows all this.
[00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:32.587]  He's a self-made man, but he comes from the Eastern establishment, his dad was pro-America,
[00:11:32.587 --> 00:11:35.427]  but definitely part of it.
[00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:46.959]  He understands that the rest of the story is about tragedy and hope and it's about
[00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:52.519]  skull and bones and it's about Bohemian Grove and it's about a bigger larger plan and it's
[00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:58.919]  my job to popularize these truths to then introduce it to the general public so folks
[00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:03.439]  like Tucker Carlson can continue to then carry the ball.
[00:12:03.439 --> 00:12:05.719]  And this isn't about Infowars getting credit.
[00:12:05.719 --> 00:12:10.119]  It's about you understanding Infowars' role as listeners and viewers to be the ones that
[00:12:10.119 --> 00:12:18.039]  pro-generate or who are the fount of the full compendium of how the entire system works
[00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:20.879]  because it's good to expose that wokeness is a fraud.
[00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:23.159]  It's good to expose it's racist and divisional.
[00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.479]  It's good to expose it's making us weaker.
[00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:28.379]  It's good to expose it helps our enemies.
[00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:30.419]  But who put communist China in power?
[00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:31.419]  Who put V.I.
[00:12:31.439 --> 00:12:32.439]  in power?
[00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:33.439]  Who put Adolf Hitler in power?
[00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:39.299]  I'm going to tell you again coming up in just a moment and Robert Barnes that went to Yale
[00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:40.299]  is also quite the historian.
[00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:46.079]  He'll be able to comment it as well but let's get back to Carlson and then I'm going to
[00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:52.479]  lay out in a summation who's behind it and I'm going to name names and how to stop them
[00:12:52.479 --> 00:12:58.179]  then we're going to get Barnes on after I air this important Skull and Bones exclusive.
[00:12:58.287 --> 00:13:17.607]  And if confirmed, I will fight hard to stamp out sexual assault and to rid our ranks of
[00:13:17.607 --> 00:13:20.727]  racists and extremists.
[00:13:20.727 --> 00:13:25.167]  The job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies.
[00:13:25.167 --> 00:13:31.487]  But we can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.
[00:13:31.487 --> 00:13:33.407]  So Republicans voted to confirm him.
[00:13:33.407 --> 00:13:35.607]  He is himself an extremist.
[00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:40.447]  And they have said virtually nothing about Lloyd Austin since because they're paralyzed.
[00:13:40.447 --> 00:13:46.047]  They're paralyzed because Lloyd Austin has no problem calling his opponents racist immediately,
[00:13:46.047 --> 00:13:49.647]  ridding our ranks of racists and extremists.
[00:13:49.647 --> 00:13:54.207]  The key question is, how does Lloyd Austin define a racist or an extremist?
[00:13:54.247 --> 00:13:55.607]  The definition matters.
[00:13:55.607 --> 00:14:00.047]  This show has been denounced as a dangerous white supremacist organ for the crime of reading
[00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:02.267]  Martin Luther King quotes on the air.
[00:14:02.267 --> 00:14:05.687]  So it's worth finding out what those words mean.
[00:14:05.687 --> 00:14:08.567]  But Lloyd Austin doesn't provide a definition.
[00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:12.047]  And that's not accidental because what you're seeing is not an attempt to make the military
[00:14:12.047 --> 00:14:13.047]  better.
[00:14:13.047 --> 00:14:16.247]  What you're seeing is a political purge of the military.
[00:14:16.247 --> 00:14:20.567]  Consider what has been happening during the military's training on, quote, extremism.
[00:14:20.567 --> 00:14:23.927]  A lot of enlisted soldiers have asked a pretty basic question.
[00:14:23.927 --> 00:14:30.687]  Hey, wait a minute, weren't the BLM and Antifa rioters this summer extremists?
[00:14:30.687 --> 00:14:31.687]  Seems like they were.
[00:14:31.687 --> 00:14:32.687]  They murdered people.
[00:14:32.687 --> 00:14:35.407]  They murdered a lot more people than died at the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:36.887]  A lot more.
[00:14:36.887 --> 00:14:38.047]  They burned businesses.
[00:14:38.047 --> 00:14:39.047]  They wrecked cities.
[00:14:39.047 --> 00:14:42.687]  In some places, it took the National Guard to stop them.
[00:14:42.687 --> 00:14:45.287]  So why aren't these people, quote, extremists?
[00:14:45.287 --> 00:14:46.287]  Hmm, good question.
[00:14:46.847 --> 00:14:51.127]  Well, a man called Ramon Colon Lopez was called in to explain why, to tell the troops why
[00:14:51.127 --> 00:14:52.607]  they were wrong.
[00:14:52.607 --> 00:14:57.967]  Colon Lopez is the senior enlisted advisor to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:14:57.967 --> 00:15:02.007]  These questions, he conceded, are, quote, coming from every echelon that we're talking
[00:15:02.007 --> 00:15:03.007]  to.
[00:15:03.007 --> 00:15:07.007]  Some people may think, all right, so the events of 6th of January happened.
[00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:11.087]  How come you're not looking at the situation that was going on in Seattle prior to that?
[00:15:11.087 --> 00:15:13.367]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:15:13.367 --> 00:15:14.967]  Kind of an obvious question.
[00:15:15.327 --> 00:15:17.887]  Well, Ramon Colon Lopez has an answer.
[00:15:17.887 --> 00:15:19.287]  Actually, it's more of a threat.
[00:15:19.287 --> 00:15:24.167]  Quote, I am concerned about the way that some people are looking at the current environment
[00:15:24.167 --> 00:15:29.007]  and what they are thinking they can do and act upon based upon their personal beliefs.
[00:15:29.007 --> 00:15:34.767]  Oh, in other words, if you ask questions like these obvious questions, you are by definition
[00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.207]  dangerous.
[00:15:36.207 --> 00:15:40.647]  Colon Lopez said he was working hard to, quote, make sure that military members understand
[00:15:40.647 --> 00:15:42.887]  the difference between Seattle and Washington, D.C.
[00:15:42.887 --> 00:15:44.407]  All right, what are those differences exactly?
[00:15:44.807 --> 00:15:45.807]  Well, here's one.
[00:15:45.807 --> 00:15:51.447]  BLM, Colon Lopez explained, is a, quote, social injustice organization, and therefore it's
[00:15:51.447 --> 00:15:52.447]  not extreme.
[00:15:52.447 --> 00:15:57.527]  Also, quote, when the military called upon us to go ahead and support an effort in Washington,
[00:15:57.527 --> 00:15:58.567]  we did.
[00:15:58.567 --> 00:16:02.167]  We never got called for the law enforcement issue that was happening in Seattle.
[00:16:02.167 --> 00:16:07.647]  Oh, so the mayor of Seattle never called the National Guard to put down Antifa, therefore
[00:16:07.647 --> 00:16:10.447]  Antifa is not an extremist organization.
[00:16:10.447 --> 00:16:12.967]  Well, that's ludicrous, obviously.
[00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:15.007]  In fact, it's not even true.
[00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:17.847]  Actually the National Guard did deploy to Seattle during the riots last summer, but
[00:16:17.847 --> 00:16:18.847]  whatever.
[00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:21.567]  Colon Lopez's job isn't to make sense.
[00:16:21.567 --> 00:16:25.207]  It's to send a political message from the Joe Biden administration.
[00:16:25.207 --> 00:16:26.967]  We're in charge now.
[00:16:26.967 --> 00:16:27.967]  And it's beyond that.
[00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:31.247]  We're going to go back to a little bit more of this in a moment.
[00:16:31.247 --> 00:16:39.167]  But they have put globalist operatives in charge of the Pentagon, of the intelligence
[00:16:39.167 --> 00:16:44.607]  agencies, of the banking, of everything, because it's their political cover.
[00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:50.670]  That when your lights go out because they cut your power off, they go, okay, it's okay.
[00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.670]  We got a bunch of minorities in the power positions.
[00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.670]  You can't criticize them or you're racist, even though they're not even running anything.
[00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.670]  It's the globalists using as a figurehead brown people.
[00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.670]  So they say to whites, you're bad, you're evil, you've been mean to people.
[00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.670]  And if you don't do what we say, we're going to say you're mean to brown people.
[00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:16.670]  And then they put brown people up there as their front operators to shut down all debate and all discussion.
[00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.670]  It's super cold blooded. It's extremely exploitive.
[00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:29.389]  But it's being done because it works, because a world government is being established and
[00:17:29.389 --> 00:17:35.149]  they are going to outlaw all indigenous cultures. They're going to outlaw anyone having any
[00:17:35.149 --> 00:17:42.670]  real identity. And then you must only accept the new global government, anti-God, anti-family,
[00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:48.070]  anti-human, post-human, trans-human identity, and there'll be a new download every day of
[00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.750]  how you're supposed to behave and what you're supposed to do. And if you don't submit to
[00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.909]  that, well, then you're the enemy and you'll have your social credit score cut off. You
[00:17:56.909 --> 00:18:01.550]  won't be able to get on an airplane and you'll be starved to death. And they know that once
[00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.950]  they domesticate everybody and everybody on the government dole, they'll have a giant
[00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.950]  army of people always ready to come up by the millions and burn down any city.
[00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:19.410]  The second the globalist media tells them to and so we're being put into checkmate right
[00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.610]  now and it's absolutely got to be reversed.
[00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.129]  It's also designed to make good people get out of the police and good people get out
[00:18:25.129 --> 00:18:28.890]  of the military because they're not going to put up with this crap being told that they're
[00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.810]  bad because they're a Christian or they're bad because they're a man or they're bad because
[00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.430]  they're white and a man and straight.
[00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:42.350]  And so once they leave the vacuum is there it's open and in comes the vacuum all of the
[00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:48.870]  George Soros district attorneys all the George Soros attorney generals all of the globalist
[00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.590]  operatives and now they can persecute whoever they want now their criminals are above the
[00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:59.150]  law and now they've taken over the local government the last thing to fall is the federal government
[00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:03.790]  they've already done that by election fraud so this country is in total red level crisis
[00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:10.810]  and one of the few people at a major level fighting it is Tucker Carlson and we're very very blessed that he's there and
[00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:14.810]  And he goes through all this and he shows the lies, but that's the litmus test
[00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:20.050]  You basically must pledge allegiance to Black Lives Matter and Antifa say that they're not bad people
[00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:24.690]  Well, of course not. I mean we were told by Joy Behar and Congressman Nadler they don't exist
[00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:30.770]  but then four citizens dying and one cop having a heart attack is Pearl Harbor and the end of the world
[00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:37.210]  And an insurrection and so we need permanent troops and barbed wire and all the rest of it to keep us safe while the border
[00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.210]  Is wide open though
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:46.300]  It's incredible but i'm gonna talk about who's behind it and what their total endgame here
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.780]  is in just a moment then we'll get robert barnes on to break this down after the skull and bones
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.180]  report that ties into all this but first let's get a few more minutes from the tucker carlson report
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.899]  actually the national guard did deploy to seattle during the riots last summer but whatever
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.580]  colin lopez's job isn't to make sense it's to send a political message from the joe biden
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:11.740]  administration we're in charge now this week we spoke to a dea agent who was fired for being in
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:17.340]  washington on january 6th he didn't riot he never even went into the capitol building in fact he
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.940]  defended the cops outside against the rioters he's on video doing that but it didn't matter
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:29.180]  he didn't vote for joe biden so he's gone and he's hardly alone earlier this month the fbi
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:34.860]  arrested a man from oklahoma called anthony alfred griffith according to the fbi here's
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:41.020]  anthony alfred griffith's crime he walked into the capitol building threw open doors and took
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:47.980]  pictures then he handed those pictures to federal investigators here's the fbi's criminal complaint
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:53.899]  against griffith it accuses him quote of witnessing multiple people trying to break down a door
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:21:00.700]  oh he saw it happen so for the crime of witnessing other people of trying to break down a door
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:07.340]  anthony alfred griffith now faces seven years in prison but don't worry people like anthony
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.500]  alfred griffith our leaders tell us are extremists they're white supremacists and our military needs
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:17.100]  to be laser focused on making certain that no one who votes like these people do can ever
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:25.179]  serve in the armed forces again we absolutely need to look at uh any type of white supremacists
[00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:29.420]  that are still members of the military and how they're being targeted for recruitment by white
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:34.060]  supremacist groups and we need to weed this out this whole idea of a police officer on police
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.260]  officer violence with those officers who have been turned by white extremists is really that's
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.659]  enough of her and the rest of the report just gets better again it's at info wars.com most
[00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:48.460]  of you probably already seen it but both duckworth and the next racist lady they get on
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.940]  say that men should never have a right to speak no men should that are white men should ever be
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:59.260]  in government unless they're gay these are the incredibly racist bizarre tribal statements out
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.139]  of these women that have the full power of the banks the media the universities the system behind
[00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:06.139]  them because they're here to destroy this country
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:14.580]  so that's where all this is going the left wants to purge every institution and they're
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.459]  going to threaten you and make you agree with them on their policies of open border and
[00:22:18.459 --> 00:22:23.820]  high taxes and regulations and the sellout of our technology to China or you're gonna
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.540]  be called a racist but it doesn't do anything when they call you a racist you don't care
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.980]  because it's not true but now the corporations gang up and they persecute you and give you
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:39.260]  a low social credit score which is already in place well do you think it's gonna get
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:45.120]  any better by submitting to this type of bullying and tyranny no you know we've already gone
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:51.939]  off the edge of the cliff here it only gets worse the more we submit and that leads me
[00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:56.939]  to the key point that Carlson made there because he made almost every point except the historical
[00:22:56.939 --> 00:23:00.020]  understanding of where all this comes from and I understand he knows his audience isn't
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.260]  ready for that it would make it too complex but I will do that here but notice the key
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.740]  thing he explained about that man
[00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:13.830]  who defended the police against the few of the rioters who lost his job got in trouble
[00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:19.030]  or the next gentleman that took photos of people rioting gave it to the feds and they were so
[00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:24.149]  hungry to indict more people they indicted him so now if you see a robbery and call the police
[00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:30.629]  i guess and you got a surveillance camera but you go to jail that is just the frothing behavior of
[00:23:30.629 --> 00:23:35.270]  the justice department doing 60 minutes interview saying oh we know it's sedition we know it's
[00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:39.909]  insurrection we know trump and roger stone and jones ran it all we're gonna get them
[00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:45.909]  and we've ordered the fbi to go out and discover those facts people tell me they go jones are you
[00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:51.830]  nervous no not at all it's like they found a dead girl in wisconsin uh you know and they
[00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.949]  jones you're under investigation for killing a dead girl in wisconsin well i'm not worried
[00:23:54.949 --> 00:23:57.669]  about it because i don't know any girl in wisconsin that's just a hypothetical
[00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:05.790]  the only thing i'm guilty of on the 6 is being set up by the deep state globalists
[00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:10.550]  who brag in time magazine how they set and provocateur the whole damn thing up with the
[00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.430]  Q operatives
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:21.440]  but let's just continue here he talked about how the man just for being there and seeing
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:28.640]  it was guilty well it gets worse less than two percent of southerners owned slaves at
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.720]  the end of the civil war that was about the peak the whole time only rich landowners had
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.480]  slaves rich farmers
[00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:45.610]  how do you say today then have reparations when a 98% of people don't have any connection
[00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:51.490]  to slavery and then b more than half the country came here and immigrated here after the civil
[00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:57.689]  war in fact it's almost double came in after civil war what came in previously so then
[00:24:57.689 --> 00:24:59.449]  how do you blame those people
[00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:29.490]  how do you blame somebody from ukraine or somebody from georgia or somebody from russia or somebody from italy whose grandparents moved here in 1902 or whatever and then now they're a great great grandkid and they own a business and they need to pay reparations to black people most of which also didn't have answers it was like i mean the idea that look if your dad when you're 10 years old goes and robs a bank and kills people no one blames you everybody
[00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:59.490]  knows you're not to blame if your mother was a heroin dealer and people took heroin and died of overdoses when you were 15 you had no idea you're not in trouble no one even thinks of that the idea that oh you are a trump supporter so you're a terrorist too or oh you're a man and all sex is rape so you've got to apologize for the whole history of how bad men are saying our species is bad saying one half of our race is bad
[00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:12.100]  and and the idea that here it is right here Australia school forces young boys to collectively apologize to female classmates for sexism and rape
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:42.120]  infowars.com it's direct links to the Australian universities governments all of it and this is what's taught at universities and people say oh that's a bunch of quacks I mean I mean I remember when I was in college they were teaching all sexist rape and it was always weird ugly feminist girls going around saying it all day that they were just mad that men didn't pay any attention and they were always trying to horn in and like you know pick up your girlfriend or whatever and you know piss when your girlfriend wouldn't go with them at the pool wall
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:27:12.120]  they were just trying to be men it's like hey lady I'm not mad at you you like girls I like girls too it's just that you want to be a man just like the men becoming trans want to be women and all it is is an act of domination and an act of control and it has the full backing of the Tavistock Institute and the globalist CIA and all of it because they're transhumanists they want to break up the human family and play God that's all this is and I'll explain it in a moment but
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:42.120]  on its face everyone knows it is a crime to teach young boys ages youngest five six seven eight years old and right up to college that because you're a man you're a boy because you're of your biology you are inherently bad that is insane and criminal but it's done from the universities from the system from the power structure to tell everybody you're not just bad because you're a man you're even worse because you're white but you're it's okay you can be in government if you're trans
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:28:05.199]  who's obsessed with sterilizing boys as young as five that's not a horror book character that's not somebody out of a horror movie that's not a nightmare novel no no that's your loving deputy head of health and human services Australia school forces young boys to collectively apologize to female classmates for sexism and rape
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:34.840]  so I mean I guess because Jeffrey Dahmer killed people you need to apologize for that too if you're a human that's criminal and that's what these truth and reconciliation commissions the Soviets would do when they took over a country it's what they did in South Africa it's pure communism it's pure evil and it's getting you to denounce yourself and say you're bad in front of everyone and then comes the physical purging and the physical murder of those that declare themselves bad in front of all these idiots
[00:28:34.850 --> 00:29:01.590]  The Broward College Secondary School in Victoria Australia has come under fire this week after it was revealed that 12 year old male students were forced to stand and apologize to female classmates on behalf of the entire male gender alone for societal sexism and rape you think oh that's isolated oh like the cops and the feds bowing to Black Lives Matter and Antifa and that wasn't enough they said lay on your belly
[00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:29.620]  you see here's another one video oh guys pull this article up I want to show people it's on Infowars.com list of suspects committing anti-asian hate crimes in New York City contains zero white people so the crime statistics show nationwide is the rarest form of crime is white on Asian the most common form of crime is black on black next black on Asian then black on Hispanic then black on white
[00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:59.630]  and then white on white is after that people usually kill who they're close to there it is list of suspects committing anti-asian hate crimes in New York City contains zero zero oh doesn't matter we've shown you footage here a few weeks ago of big rallies against white supremism to quote stop attacks on the Asians the Washington Post had to do a correction updates headline that claimed there was no migrant surge they said quote
[00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:29.630]  no one's there nothing's happening that gas lighting blew up in their face so they had to retract it there's another example Oakland to give 500 a month to minorities but not to whites again putting discrimination into the very code of everything so they can discriminate however else they want it's not because they want to help blacks I guarantee you the strings attached to that are going to be deadly inoculation all of it they said tie inoculation to it
[00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:35.630]  and oh meanwhile George Floyd died with enough fentanyl they said to kill three people
[00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:41.690]  he was dying when the cop held him down when he asked me put on the ground I'm
[00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:49.610]  not defending any of what transpired but now George Floyd called blacks called on
[00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.650]  him because he was reportedly you know passing fake bills and threatening
[00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.690]  people and going nuts on drugs he's a big guy they all knew him well cop knew
[00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.690]  him well worked with him in a nightclub
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:03.740]  and they said because somebody at a whole display about him put a paper out
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:08.260]  showing his toxicology report they said that whoever did to insult Floyd
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.460]  deserved to die no CNN said that they were showing that he had enough in his
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.820]  body to kill three people and that was the cause of death as ruled by the
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.300]  coroner
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:26.300]  absolutely fatal level of fentanyl oh that means he deserved to die no that means he
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:31.300]  killed himself the Chinese killed him the Chinese communist all right we're gonna get
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:36.300]  Robert Barnes on after I air this special report we'll be talking about all of this
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.420]  and a lot more but this is very serious well this is now the main operating system of the
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:46.260]  Pentagon to purge it and it's extremely dangerous and it's got to be resisted at every level
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.900]  we have a globalist beachhead a stolen election they know they stole it they have a job to
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.660]  wreck the economy wreck the borders wreck the dollar and they know the public's gonna
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.300]  figure out that they're being wrecked their prescription drug prices just tripled all
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:07.980]  of it is coming out so what is the rest of the story well watch this report on skull
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.580]  and bones
[00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:17.470]  And we come back in a few minutes for Barnes is on I will give you the rest of the story
[00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:23.070]  encapsulated in a nutshell of why all this divide and conquer is happening and who's
[00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:28.790]  behind it and who's doing it and what their plan is and is it to really liberate everybody
[00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:33.870]  or is it to do something else and I think you already know what that plan is and how
[00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:40.070]  we can defeat it Robert Barnes also went to Yale he can speak to 322 it all ties together
[00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.910]  so you know their game plan you know what they're doing but but who are they and then
[00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:50.990]  what comes after this system is put in place what's what's the end game I was there at
[00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.710]  Yale on 322 didn't even think about it till we got back the next day and Robbie pointed
[00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:59.910]  it out here is the report and then Robert Barnes joins us to lay out so much please
[00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:00.510]  stay with us
[00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:42.230]  we're playing a little guessing game right now where am I in the United States well
[00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:46.910]  I'm on the East Coast and I'm in the state of Connecticut in a college town of New Haven
[00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:53.190]  and a very important historical site to any American that wants to understand the true
[00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:59.750]  elites that run this country and much of the world so what we have is a secret society
[00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:09.910]  which over the last hundred and fifty years has accumulated about 2500 members of whom
[00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:20.190]  perhaps 500 are alive today of this 500 perhaps 100 are actively in pursuit of the objectives
[00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:30.990]  of the order it's not another college fraternal society you have been chosen to become members
[00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:40.070]  of America's most secret society for over a hundred years Skull and Bones members included
[00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:47.950]  a president vice presidents Supreme Court justices congressmen and senators captains
[00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:52.430]  of science and industry the very best of America
[00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:08.230]  and there she blows one of the most famous secret societies in the world the most famous
[00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:14.270]  here in the United States that's the order of death lodged 322 of Skull and Bones set up in
[00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:19.910]  1832 by the Russell Trust out of Germany that was the trust that controlled the major global
[00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:24.550]  opium trade and out of this has come at least three presidents a bunch of Supreme Court justices
[00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:29.990]  you name it out of this organization right here the order of death and it's not the only secret
[00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:35.350]  society here in New Haven Connecticut at Yale Yale University is 300 years old this year and
[00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:40.110]  where you to visit its campus you would see that it still has exotic clubhouses which look like
[00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:47.510]  tombs where Yale's legendary secret societies meet their prestige and importance have largely
[00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:52.790]  evaporated but the rituals are still a secret so here we are at Skull and Bones in amongst all
[00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:59.550]  this classic gothic architecture that's really the rooms of the Old Republic we have another
[00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:08.230]  entrance to Skull and Bones and back over that wall in that courtyard is where ABC news caught
[00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:13.190]  the footage of them doing a satanic ritual dedicated to Satan okay you have the doorway
[00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:17.830]  here yeah okay then to the right you have a hedge and then you have an evergreen tree if you follow
[00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:23.270]  that line straight back courtyards in there so so that's where they have the ceremonies in the
[00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:27.750]  outdoor part of it part of it was indoors so we only got to see the actual part right we only got
[00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:31.750]  the end and to listen to the actor apart God only knows what went on indoors and what did you hear
[00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:37.670]  what was it you know you managed to get this unique oh it was disgusting it was gross I mean
[00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:43.990]  they were pretending to murder people what was the tone of it though was it was it joke you know it
[00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:54.990]  wasn't jokey at all it was it was sick it's not the only thing describing it was sick what you're
[00:36:54.990 --> 00:37:00.830]  hearing is the first recording ever made of the Skull and Bones initiation ceremony it has never
[00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:12.910]  been broadcast before through this gates where they do the rituals through this gates it's where
[00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:19.270]  the country's future controllers are put together to carry out very dark twisted acts to cement them
[00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:32.390]  in the darkness of a cult 15 new members of the club are being introduced into the macabre
[00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:38.470]  rituals of Skull and Bones by the senior students who are about to graduate the club has what some
[00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:44.270]  might see as a strange fascination with death skulls and bones as the chance to
[00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:55.110]  a lot of sides claim to be historical but Skull and Bones is extremely historical nobody knew
[00:37:55.110 --> 00:38:00.790]  anything about it until during the senator Frank Church committee hearings back in the 1970s
[00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:06.790]  Charlotte Iserby who was a daughter of a Skull and Bones member leaked some of the secret annals and
[00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:12.950]  documents from inside this organization to them and many many years later it was Robert De Niro
[00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:17.670]  that produced a major film titled the Good Shepherd that was basically based on those
[00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:23.910]  historical documents you understand that whatever we discuss here doesn't leave this room of course
[00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:30.710]  well eventually get involved in this war not because we want to but because we have to and
[00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:35.630]  we should and the president has asked me to look into creating a foreign intelligence service and
[00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:39.750]  if that happens I'll be looking for patriotic honorable bright young men from the right
[00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:59.750]  backgrounds to manage the various departments you'd be trained and commissioned in the army
[00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:03.350]  and posted overseas if it's something you're interested in you'd have to be ready to leave
[00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:10.670]  at a moment's notice I don't want your answer now just think about it but this isn't a bunch
[00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:18.710]  of fraternity boys sitting around playing with their pricks this is for real for America bones men
[00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:28.390]  it was president Taft who took over Bohemian Grove in Northern California and turned into
[00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:34.030]  an offshoot of skull and bones for the graduates to go to and conduct some of the same rituals and
[00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:40.870]  that's on record in their own annals so people think about Bohemian Grove that I really popularized
[00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:47.310]  maybe more famous when I infiltrated it in the year 2000 this is where they send their young
[00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:52.870]  people to get them into the sex orgies and the Satanism and the channeling demonic spirits go
[00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:57.230]  up front so this is just kind of the hors d'oeuvre before they get sent off to the other German
[00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:03.910]  death cults in fact if you go back men in power as a political retrospective was written by Helmut
[00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:09.630]  Schmidt who was German Chancellor back when it was still West Germany and he said oh I love the
[00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:14.910]  groves we have in Germany where we do our druidic rituals but he said what they have at Bohemian
[00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:21.510]  Grove is my favorite an offshoot of our lodge 322 so this is a lodge of really a druidic we call it
[00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:26.070]  a German death cult but really it's your druidic death cult so you see the Nazis wearing the Order
[00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:31.470]  of the Death's Head Skull and the lightning bolts this is not a Nazi lodge the Nazis were a lodge of
[00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:36.470]  this but you're not gonna see the ADL or Southern Poverty Law Center talking about that they're too
[00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:41.150]  busy giving George Soros a Nazi collaborator and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger Awards because
[00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:46.190]  they're actual Nazis but here it is this is a group that predates the Nazis but of the same
[00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:51.550]  Order of Death Order of the Death's Head is actually its true term but they don't have a
[00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:56.350]  little skull and crossbows like a pirate it wears a crown and so that's their mascot is a skull with
[00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:01.990]  a crown on it and then two crossbows and again it means that you're all their slaves and that you
[00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.790]  all deserve to be their slaves and that you are basically subhuman and so here they are ladies and
[00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.910]  gentlemen they finance the Third Reich everything and just like Bill Gates's dad they're not any
[00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:22.550]  trouble skull and bones the order at Yale 15 of them selected out of every junior class they paid
[00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:29.110]  Wall Street financed Hitler financed Stalin creating communism which is what they did that's
[00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:35.390]  all very bad and skull and bones is all involved in that with the order they concerned the buildup
[00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:42.190]  of the three types of socialism a Bolshevik socialism in Russia what we might call welfare
[00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:49.190]  socialism in the United States and Hitler in or national socialism and each book examines the
[00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:55.590]  financing and the contributions made by Wall Street by international bankers to that to the
[00:41:55.590 --> 00:42:01.270]  development of that specific form of socialism it also is involved in changing the American
[00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:08.670]  education system from a classical academic brain oriented thinking destroying that and imposing
[00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:14.510]  animal training method which skull and bones were deeply involved and I think I would just say the
[00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:22.230]  only entity at that time deeply involved and managed to bring that wretched system of operant
[00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:28.030]  conditioning Pavlov skin or whatever you want to call it animal training out of the laboratory in
[00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:46.790]  Leipzig Germany will him want and get it adopted by leading American educators my father and
[00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:53.070]  grandfather were members of the order skull and bones was put together by William Russell in 1830
[00:42:53.230 --> 00:43:01.390]  secret society at Yale University and the connections with Germany are pretty extensive
[00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:09.270]  in the Illuminati of course was Bavarian Marxist society based on getting destroying the family
[00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:14.830]  destroying the church which at that time was because all Catholicism I have you know the
[00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:21.670]  proofs of conspiracy by Robeson the original copy of that and it says right in there you know
[00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:32.710]  where the order it's interesting the order right the goal was to just as I said down with a family
[00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:39.430]  down with the royalty at that time governments were royalty and and they were religious that
[00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:50.030]  was Western European right down with nationalism get rid of countries drop borders drop borders
[00:43:50.030 --> 00:44:02.030]  I mean and people think that that's new inside that building they have the skull of Geronimo
[00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:07.150]  they stole president Martin Van Buren and others but that's not the most important part they lay
[00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:12.270]  in coffins and are reborn and channel these spirits they also tell each other all their
[00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:18.670]  deepest dark secrets so this is literally a satanic sex cult that was all-male before
[00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:23.790]  because they would engage in homosexual sex acts but now the girls get to be involved in
[00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:29.550]  this organization and then they're part of this this cult that goes forward into the future building
[00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:34.510]  their their final aim their final goal and what is their final goal well that they be kings of
[00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:41.630]  the earth and rule over us the slaves but don't look for CNN or MSNBC to criticize this organization
[00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:44.830]  no no they're there to create an ascension and divide and conquer amongst the people
[00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:49.150]  not actually go after really corrupt evil organizations that actually supported the
[00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:54.270]  Nazis before World War II but it's okay because they let girls in now so it's all right
[00:44:55.550 --> 00:45:01.870]  Perlin Geronimo is the warrior's great-grandson he and other descendants are suing Yale University
[00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:07.070]  and the secret society known as the Order of Skull and Bones claiming Geronimo's skull was
[00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:14.670]  stolen back in 1918 by Yale students members of the secret order one of the alleged grave robbers
[00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:23.710]  Yali Prescott Bush the father and grandfather of presidents 41 and 43. For decades members called
[00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:29.950]  bones men dismissed the suggestion as a hoax but a bones man's letter written in 1918 discovered
[00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:36.670]  two years ago at Yale suggests otherwise quote the skull of the worthy Geronimo the terrible
[00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:43.950]  exhumed now safe inside the T. T is believed short for the tomb the bones man's private club
[00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:48.350]  now we just saw a young lady go in here do a little passcode and opened up she went in
[00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:52.190]  we're free Americans there's not a gate here we're going to go knock on the door and see
[00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:55.710]  if they invite us into their castle or into their tomb as it's called
[00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:09.390]  I wonder if Count Dracula is going to answer wonder what this is oh there's a little
[00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.030]  code system on the door wonder what's 666 to enter
[00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:26.590]  look you've got like a old safe door right there hi it's Alex Jones I was just here selling
[00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:35.950]  encyclopedia subscriptions actually I'm a contact tracer sent here by the Biden administration to
[00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:40.990]  see if you've had your COVID-19 vaccines I know you care about us you want to depopulate us
[00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:47.230]  so again I just dropped by thanks for granddaddy Bush and Prescott Bush the main Nazi
[00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:52.990]  lawyer in the U.S. and the George Herbert Walker Bush and of course his son you were both in
[00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:58.110]  skull and bones the secret society it's so sick we can't talk about it what does that mean for
[00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:03.310]  America the conspiracy theorists are going to go I'm sure they are I don't know I haven't seen
[00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:11.070]  number 322 you both were members of skull and bones a secret society at Yale what does that
[00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:17.710]  tell us uh not much because it's a secret is there a secret handshake is there a secret code
[00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:22.750]  I wish there were something secret I could manifest 322 a secret number there are all
[00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:27.550]  kinds of secrets but one thing is not a secret I disagree with this president's direction
[00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:31.870]  that he's taking the country we can do a better job than I intend to do it so we thought we
[00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:40.910]  come by and see if anybody's home bang on the tomb door I guess everybody I guess everybody's
[00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:47.230]  asleep inside there right now everything's fine inside the tomb well make sure you're locked and
[00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:52.190]  snugged into your little tomb that'll be a good place for you into eternity here we're all going

[00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:21.070]  I know they mainly meet on Thursdays for official meetings but they're inside right now former
[00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:26.830]  bones man living or dead living but you'd better hurry engage cloaking device
[00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:35.550]  nothing relaxes me like a stiff drink from the skull of Martin Van Buren care for some
[00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:40.030]  Pancho Villa is everything in this school surrendered to diversity
[00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:47.870]  I could start my own college whoa whoa whoa we can't talk business in here just general schemes
[00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:52.510]  for world domination fraternal handshake oh all right
[00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:58.510]  you are on my radar
[00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:09.310]  here we are under this amazing cathedral with this incredible chimes coming out of it and just a few
[00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:16.510]  hundred yards away is skull and bones a temple to global secret societies a a temple to
[00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:24.110]  the CIA it was this organization on record that helped found the CIA in 1947 and we only know
[00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:28.510]  about this because of Charlotte Isby whose father on his deathbed confessed to her the
[00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.950]  secrets of skull and bones and gave her the secret documents that she gave him to Anthony
[00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:38.510]  Sutton with the senate report and that's the reason we even know about skull and bones that's
[00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:43.310]  why it's important for reporters to expose Bohemian Grove skull and bones uh the secret
[00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:47.870]  of the Davos group in Bilderberg because that's how we understand that these groups
[00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:52.910]  organize and try to use their power to consolidate more power over us they're the people behind the
[00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:57.070]  great reset they're the people behind the big globalist power grab and again that's why we're
[00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:00.670]  here truly speaking truth of power and trying to just get the population aware of the fact that
[00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:06.029]  these things do exist that's why we're here guests of the new world order bones men
[00:50:06.029 --> 00:50:12.590]  and nobody gets a selfie with skull and bones in the background
[00:50:16.029 --> 00:50:21.630]  throughout the ages every human culture has noticed that there are strange things that
[00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:28.270]  happen there's something about timing in the universe serendipity synchronicity clairvoyance
[00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:34.350]  everyone recognizes that there's something going on there's something hidden that's what the occult
[00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:40.270]  means we were in Connecticut on a totally separate matter myself and just two members of the crew
[00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:49.710]  and upon returning on 32321 Rob Dew one of my oldest crew members and the cameraman that shot
[00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:57.710]  the footage you've just watched said Alex do you realize that we were in Connecticut and went to
[00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:07.070]  skull and bones for the first time ever on 322 which is their high holy number and that they also
[00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:14.510]  conduct some of their most bizarre rituals reportedly on 322 so imagine we show up there
[00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:19.950]  literally on a lark realizing that the tomb was down the road and it's on the day of their high
[00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:25.950]  holy day you see there's a power in the universe bigger than the globalist bigger than the satanist
[00:51:26.029 --> 00:51:33.070]  it's called god and it's real they want to play god but they're not god if you want to see our
[00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:39.150]  censored films on my infiltration of bohemian grove 21 years ago it's called dark secrets inside
[00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:47.550]  bohemian grove it's absolutely free at band.video in the info wars films section along with an
[00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:54.910]  updated film with even more footage and a new infiltration five years later in 2005 that film
[00:51:54.910 --> 00:52:01.950]  is titled the order of death find both films for free at band.video and share them because
[00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:14.990]  knowledge is power
[00:52:32.029 --> 00:52:34.990]  uh
[00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:44.430]  info wars tomorrow's news today that's right my friends so there is that very important 17
[00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:50.029]  minute report it's posted at band.video i hope you will share it because a lot of people aren't
[00:52:50.029 --> 00:52:56.510]  aware of who's ruling over them and it it's very simple modern psychology was being developed
[00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:05.710]  250 years ago in germany adam weishaupt who was the head of a major department at a college
[00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:15.390]  also a jesuit priest had a plan to overthrow the church and overthrow the elites overthrow the
[00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:20.350]  royalty and set up their own organization and their own documents got captured by the germans
[00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:26.750]  the austrians it came out they admitted it was historic and they set up other lodges around the
[00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:34.510]  world to help set up their illuminati plan and thomas jefferson wrote about this george washington
[00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:39.550]  you can type in george washington's letters national archives library of congress have
[00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:44.510]  dozens of letters there's actually hundreds of letters but dozens on the illuminati and how they
[00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:48.430]  tried to take over the american revolution the french revolution and how bad they were and how
[00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:53.310]  they really wanted absolute power and total control and how they hated george washington
[00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:59.870]  so this was known at the time mainstream news at the time hundreds and hundreds of books that i
[00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:04.830]  know of were written on it at the time and then later like proves of this conspiracy that we just
[00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:10.190]  covered earlier and so it's people claiming brotherhood of man empowerment of humanity
[00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:17.950]  but they're only doing it so they get control of society and so they can say oh don't question our
[00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:22.350]  slave camps you're racist or oh don't question open borders are racist or don't question the
[00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:26.910]  pentagon coming to confiscate your guns look all the generals coming to confiscate your guns
[00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:34.270]  general honore and general austin well they're black so if you don't turn your guns in why
[00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.150]  you're fighting black people i mean it's very elementary really
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:43.660]  but the very same group came out and sent in hearings from the hundreds of documents and
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:49.020]  dozens of books and annals that her that her father and grandfather had two generations of
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:56.300]  skull and bones so her grandfather was only like she's really old now probably almost 90 now her
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:01.660]  grandfather was only like second generation skull and bones her dad was third generation
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:08.460]  so this goes way back folks and it was all there and confirmed and then people broke into the
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:12.620]  tomb several times and everything was in her analysis and in their books it was their books
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:18.940]  was true and so they're totally cold-blooded they're total sociopaths they're total psychopaths
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:24.220]  not all of them but the group recruiting is at the top she said her dad was a good guy and later
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:27.980]  repented when he was down of cancer and gave her the information i forgot that part so it was a
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:32.460]  good guy like darth vader throwing palpatine down the mine shaft or down the reactor shaft or
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:36.380]  you know the the thief and the murderer on the cross and one believes in one doesn't you can
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:41.580]  always get redemption if you still have any soul left but that's where this came from and so we know
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:49.100]  and it's all about how they were going to go and exploit all the minorities and all the other
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:55.020]  groups by leading them but also dominate everybody else and how they wanted absolute control
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:56:00.860]  and domination over everyone and how they worship brutality and lies and fraud and deception
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:06.140]  see of those of us that want to be chivalrous and honest and good and real and we're guilty
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:10.380]  when we're jerks we're guilty when we're bad we're guilty when we revert to animalistic things
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.980]  because we know it's out of control and we know our family will be treated like that as well
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:21.900]  and there's these people that love it that totally give into it i mean my god if i gave into evil
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:28.620]  look out it's thrilling it's exhilarating to not care it's it's a it's a power trip but you're
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:33.020]  cut off from god and once you're connected to god it's so much better but bigger but painful
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:40.060]  the bible says with great knowledge comes great pain but it hurts so good but i stuck my toe into
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:45.020]  evil they have all the little subdivisions and subgroups this is just one group of the illuminati
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:49.500]  one group of the satanist the illuminati itself is just another satanic order and then they try
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:56.380]  to recruit me i mean they know who to recruit and so we're in god's society and it shouldn't
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:01.900]  be a secret or hidden it's out in the open of love and and and goodness but also standing
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.060]  up for right and not being a coward and saying no
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:11.560]  and so when I said oh Tucker's telling you a lot but not the rest of story he's telling
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:15.620]  you all about it doing a great job all these facets how they're liars how it's a fraud
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:20.880]  how it's the elite doing it how it's the establishment but people really need to get the next phase
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:26.800]  of it of the AI takeover the post-human world the synthetic humans all of this was the plan
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.860]  that they were going to transcend their human bodies promise them by Satan thousands of
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:36.340]  years ago in Egypt eternal life Genesis 322
[00:57:36.430 --> 00:58:06.430]  the promise of that but artificially not through the spirit transcending to God but through the artificiality of the replication of the human the clone and the genetic engineering nightmare and what that gives rise to we've been down this path before it's on our first rodeo to the Sumerian text Babylonian text the Egyptian text all of them this is a big deal we're about to repeat it again and just like Texas froze a few weeks ago it suddenly is all gone
[00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:27.100]  green you forget the volcanoes and the explosions and the comets and the death and the civilizations and Atlantis and all of that not just here but other worlds and it's the secret societies trying to keep you from your destiny keep you from your background keep you from who you are that Satan fell to this planet
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:35.620]  was marooned here as our tester but we came from God who is in the stars
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:39.060]  and that's what the secret societies don't want you to know they want you to
[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.420]  interface with their lie so you never discover your birthright and who you are
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:46.780]  instead of being tested and
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:53.920]  going to the next level and so to discuss more of the details of America's secret ruling
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:59:00.460]  class in this long-term strategic divide and conquer plan is constitutional lawyer and
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:06.660]  of course a former uh Yalie who resigned out of the school in protest to what they were
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:11.180]  doing my good friend constitutional lawyer but also a really smart man and a great historian
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:15.860]  Robert Barnes uh so Barnes I happen to just already be up in Connecticut on another matter
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:20.620]  uh that you know about but others don't and then we I said hey why don't we just go to
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:27.340]  Yale and I go there and the day after we were there at Skull and Bones Rob Dew said did
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:31.660]  you realize we were there on three two twos that was a very strange coincidence or synchronicity
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:36.660]  serendipity but getting into this getting into the woke military the left everyone that
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:40.260]  doesn't agree with taking down America is a racist this is coming from the establishment
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:45.420]  this is coming from the elites how do we defeat this how do we expose this how do we get all
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:49.020]  Americans to come together and see that the oldest trick in the book whether it was the
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:54.700]  great game and in India with the British imperialists or others or the Romans would be to come in
[00:59:54.700 --> 01:00:00.020]  and divide a giant population only a handful of troops by playing different groups off
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:04.740]  against each other yeah well it's one of the oldest games in the book is to be able to
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:08.860]  divide and conquer you can only conquer if you divide and that there's definitely in
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:14.220]  fact to a certain degree when I was at Yale was around the time that Skull and Bones started
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:20.700]  determining who could get in based on their status so in fact I mean I knew a buddy of
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.420]  mine he was going to pretend to be gay just to get into Skull and Bones because there
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:29.020]  was they were instituting a quota system at Skull and Bones so if you if you fit this
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:35.060]  demographic that demographic this group this group is sort of where wokeism as an ideology
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:40.220]  in terms of empowerment started sort of grew out of was out of things like that that you
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.420]  could become part of the elite but only if you fit within a certain demographic group
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:48.340]  characteristic group where you would be so your power isn't your individualism or your
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:54.980]  music or your literature your hard work or your culture or your cuisine or your anything
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:59.780]  it's all about what group you're in so this is literally just us devolving back to cavemen
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:08.740]  back to boobies back to pirates back to freebooters back to gangs exactly I used to call it you
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:12.340]  know what if you it's two different things it's dividing people into tribalism but it's
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:16.020]  also buying off potential sources of dissent because the way I used to put it when I was
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:20.740]  at Yale was what would happen if Nat Turner could have got a scholarship to Harvard the
[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:26.260]  great leader of the slave rebellion in Virginia he doesn't lead a slave rebellion so that
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:30.900]  one of the things was identifying potential dissonant groups within society and trying
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:38.100]  to buy off or pick off its potential leadership that could lead a dissent any form of dissent
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:42.820]  and try to co-op them into the system so it's operating at two levels it's operating to
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:47.620]  divide people by identifying them by status rather than skill and at the same time picking
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:52.580]  off potential dissonant groups who because of the their life experience might otherwise
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:56.820]  be a threat to the system or the establishment so it achieved both in one clean stroke.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.620]  Let's spend a few minutes on your personal experience at Yale we're showing folks one
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:06.100]  of the local news articles about it became a pretty big issue give us that little piece of
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:12.100]  history. Sure so when I was at Yale I used to like to go to the old Yale library because the
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:16.820]  library there was a bunch of masons old school workers who were who were on strike and their
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:21.300]  labor conditions were bad the late 1900s and they basically had to build that library under
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:26.020]  protest and what they did is they etched into the actual architecture of the building inside
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:31.380]  these different little mini sculptures mocking the rich and the powerful and mocking Yalies
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:36.580]  so most Yalies were totally oblivious to it so I enjoyed the sort of irony of it and when I was
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:41.300]  there I used to read different magazines and publications and sort of did a mini Alex Jones
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:45.460]  read the white papers before other people read the white papers and what I was doing was I came
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:51.540]  across the Yale alumni monthly magazine and they were floating the idea of basically changing Yale
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:57.300]  from anybody who could even if you couldn't afford it if you could get in they made sure there was
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:03.060]  full need-based financial aid and there was need-blind admission so you weren't discriminated
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:07.620]  against if you were poor they were floating the idea of getting rid of both of those doctrines
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:12.340]  of discriminating against people solely because they were poor in the admissions process and then
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.740]  denying them the ability to go to Yale using the scholarships and financial aid that were present
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:22.740]  there so I and a group of Yalies decided to form a protest organization about it ended up being very
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:27.620]  big on campus meeting with all 19 deans of Yale while I was there I got to mini experience the
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:33.220]  whole system because while I was there they I had various high-level deans of different parts of Yale
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:39.460]  basically pitch me that I could have my if I just played ball and pretended that they reformed
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:43.540]  everything and sat on some bogus committee then they would make sure I got into Yale law school
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:48.260]  and then I could have the nice uh you know work at the Kravitz Wayne and so that's what the wokeism
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:53.700]  is all about fake reform but actually things become more imperial more corrupt more oppressive
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:59.060]  exactly it's much like the way to for people to think of it is look at how the post-colonial
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:03.700]  governments treated or how the post-colonial African governments were treated by the west
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:09.380]  by their prior colonial overlords all they did was give them the a perception an image of
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:13.300]  independence while co-opting them and actually having more power than they had when they were
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:17.220]  colonial that's right that's as you show your knowledge that's the Cecil Rhodes round table
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:21.780]  group model that then was adopted in the U.S. as the council on foreign relations explain that
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:26.900]  you take down the imperial flag but you put puppets in that look like the locals but are controlled
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:33.060]  exactly I mean we've sort of done this in a lot of urban politics where where the political
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:37.780]  machine stepped back and had African-American mayors take over but they and in the name of
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:41.460]  black leadership but then what we found is that those leaders were actually more co-opted than
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.300]  the people that came before them and all the problems that existed previously were still there
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:50.180]  so we've experienced in our own American political life but in Africa they did it they did to an
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:55.060]  expert degree so putting in people who are nominally rebels nominally revolutionaries
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:59.780]  nominally independent people that were from Africa represented various groups within the
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:04.340]  particular country but in fact were co-opted to serve the interest of the colonial empire even
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:09.380]  more so than the colonial empire could do for its own sake and the the system is genius at
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:13.540]  recreating this and recrafting this when I was at Yale that was the pitch to all of us who were
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:19.220]  part of it we decided I decided the only way I could get my message out was to leave and protest
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:25.940]  so wrote an article leaving in protest explaining why and luckily that that signal was so unusual
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:30.660]  so unexpected so unanticipated that Yale University were completely reversed their
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:34.820]  position announced they would support need blind admissions need based financial aid and the rest
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:38.740]  of the Ivy League followed because they were shocked at that kind of protest and the reason
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:44.020]  this is so important is Yale and Harvard are microcosms of the entire system Xi Jinping
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:50.660]  sends his daughter to Harvard others send them to Yale and so we look at as a a joke of wokeism
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.740]  but but really it's a model of psychological control and look what just came out last year
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:59.300]  or two years ago they're now winning lawsuits in fact speak to that where they secretly said
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:05.140]  Asians aren't smart we should block Asians from admission just because you do good on math or on
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:12.340]  spelling or on or engineering doesn't matter because we have new woke systems new woke
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:20.260]  IQ systems that they secretly have created off of your wokeness I mean it's just bizarre
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:24.340]  it's thinking it's not about empowering minorities or anybody it's about fully controlling them
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:29.380]  oh absolutely they don't want independent I knew someone who actually turned down school and bones
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:33.220]  because he understood he's Puerto Rican and understood that and stayed at Puerto Rican
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:38.020]  dissident in his old political life to this day because he understood what was happening but most
[01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:43.300]  don't I mean what it is it's co-opting members of potential dissident groups to make sure they play
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.740]  ball and that's what their whole admissions policy is based on it's mostly rooted in you
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:50.740]  know helping the the powerful and the privileged stay powerful and privileged and recycling I mean
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:55.780]  that's why George W. Bush you know could be a Yalie uh he was a perfect indicator that it was
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:07:00.820]  not a place of meritocracy it was a place of power and privilege and now look at how the left now look
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:07.620]  at how the left love war and love torture and they've been totally co-opted okay I mean people
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:12.100]  I mean the original creators of the national security state were all Ivy Leaguers and
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:17.220]  predominantly Yale at Yalie I wrote about it when I was there at Yale all the founders of the OSS and
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:21.380]  the CIA and the original national security council were almost all universally Yalies
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:26.100]  many of them met in a secret literary society that they created at Yale and that's where the
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:31.620]  the initial foundation of the national security state were four guys who helped form a particular
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:36.260]  secret society at Yale and that's where the CIA was born there's a there's a statue to Nathan
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:41.140]  Hale in only two places in America one the center campus of the CIA the other the center of old
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:45.620]  campus at Yale and that's not a coincidence they used to say that you could know Yale CIA people
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:49.540]  were get together when they were singing a Yale whip and poof song like they sing at Mory's the
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:55.220]  old club there so the that's the it's deeply entrenched and institutionalized within the
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:08:00.820]  power structure and its job is to keep recreating the power structure and discrimination against
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:04.740]  no discrimination against Asians it's discrimination against a wide range of people
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:08.980]  who just don't fit what the power structure wants the power structure thinks we only need this many
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:13.779]  Asians and they're mostly focused like Georgetown is part of this too is is picking off the elite
[01:08:13.779 --> 01:08:18.020]  of foreign countries they're not interested in they're interested in G's kids they're interested
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:23.780]  in I mean Kim Jong-un sent his kids to Switzerland elite academies for the same purpose that's what
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:28.660]  they're interested in they're not interested in actual racial empowerment or economic empowerment
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:33.620]  or disadvantaged empowerment it's buying off dissent so that they don't get problems from
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:38.820]  communities that they are fearful of and and then otherwise divide and conquer through the broader
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:44.260]  population utilizing those co-opted participants to employ it and they do it as well as anybody
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:48.420]  I mean they they're their cultural institutions they're not educational institutions.
[01:08:48.410 --> 01:09:08.410]  Well said. It's so important to understand though that that Skull and Bones adopted German psychology and was a chapter of Adam Weishaupt, Ingolstadt University, or the Illuminati and that's in real history books.
[01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:20.410]  The general public sees all these TV shows and movies and thinks it's like a cartoon or something. But I know you studied that. Explain to people your understanding of the Illuminati and then these Germanic death cults that basically grew out of it.
[01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:31.410]  I want to be clear it's not Germans that are to blame. It was just they used your Druidic priesthood model that was already operating secretly in Europe that predated Christianity and already had cults in Europe.
[01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:47.410]  And the Illuminati used that as a carrier group for this new system where they would claim they're going to overthrow the establishment but really on its ashes build a complete and total tyranny which Skull and Bones has been infiltrated their own documents have been leaked to Charlotte Iserby and to Anthony Sutton and others.
[01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:57.410]  And it's all about how they're God and we're all animals and they have a right to rule over us. It's true Uber mention stuff. And so that's why Prescott Bush and others funded Hitler.
[01:09:57.410 --> 01:10:06.410]  They are obsessed with various aspects of the occult and they celebrate that. They like to incorporate that as a sense of empowerment. The ultimate objective is to be able to cheat death.
[01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:22.410]  The tomb still exists at Skull and Bones. You can't see in. When I was there you walked by it almost every day at campus. So it has this sort of ominous tone and this ominous power symbol.
[01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:32.410]  People that are brought in and you know that you're still laid out in the coffin as if you're dead and the point is that now you owe your allegiance. I call it cotton ball culture just take into a whole different level.
[01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:45.410]  So in the southeast do cotton balls to allow when 17 18 year olds are sort of coming out and really the cotton balls were limited to the elite and the goal was to let the elite know their kids you're part of a different group than everybody else.
[01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:55.410]  Everybody else isn't like you and into a culture eight them to a mindset that they should rule and dominate other people and that they should be fearful of the people that are not part of that group.
[01:10:55.410 --> 01:11:12.410]  And you just take that to an entirely different level with organizations like Skull and Bones that you physically re experience sort of a death experience where you're reborn now as a bones man you no longer who you were you no longer what you were you now part of them you identify with them you owe your allegiance to them.
[01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:35.410]  And they reciprocate your guaranteed certain income every year for the rest of your life you're guaranteed certain political protection and the degree that exist i think people would be shocked by every day of the it's who you meet at yale that's the most influential part of the yale degree of the people i still have contacts within a wide ranging positions of power all across the world because i met him during the time i was just at yale.
[01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:50.410]  That's the degree of influence in school and bones is the apex the peak of that power structure that's a culture rating people's minds to see themselves as different than the rest of the world as the overlords to the rest of the world and reshifting and reshaping their alliance and allegiance.
[01:11:50.410 --> 01:12:01.910]  To each other rather than to their family rather than to their kin or rather than to their community rather than to their own country and there's the same seduction right now whether you watch again european tv australian tv us tv.
[01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:13.750]  All the telecoms all the drug ads are black people and black people are the best and whites are bad that's the trick black people to totally serve the establishment that's literally doing secret experiments on them and out to get them.
[01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:35.550]  And and and and and and i know most black folks i know see through it but a lot of black people are really getting into this and so it's a sub level of the same seduction be with hollywood be with the establishment all these rap videos about black men becoming trans and giving up their fertility i mean the anybody that wants you to give her fertility up wants you to die.
[01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:52.950]  Oh yeah and they're running into trouble because the large numbers of african african american voters are about as a group in america are the most likely to not want to take the vaccine as an example most likely to distrust the institutional narrative i often find their great jurors because they're willing to be skeptical of the state.
[01:12:53.790 --> 01:13:15.290]  And so they've been battling for a long time as to how to shift that perspective as i call it you know what if we sit net turn into harvard maybe we don't get any more slave revolt and it's that same mindset mentality but only partially works because it doesn't really seep down to the consciousness of the lived experience of ordinary people across the board across racial lines class lines that's why trump was such a threat.
[01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:31.610]  He was making extraordinary inroads into the african american community extraordinary inroads into the mexican american community first ever republican to win zapata county named after a mexican revolutionary on the texas border this is why he was such a unique threat not only and the other thing is people forget trump is the first president.
[01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:44.809]  That's why i think before eisenhower that had never been part of bohemian grove never been part of the builder bird group never been part of any elite secret society anywhere every other one had been a part of one including from kennedy forward.
[01:13:44.889 --> 01:13:55.050]  So he broke a complete norm wasn't part of that at all and that's why they distrusted him so much he had told them by his refusal to join their secret societies.
[01:13:55.050 --> 01:14:11.809]  Their secret associations and affiliations their elite groupings and culturations that he had no interest in their world view that he had no interest in their perspective and that's why they waged war on him from the day he announced his campaign and why they're still waging war on him to this day because they only trust those that have.
[01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:24.010]  Proven their commitment to the system to the establishment to the elite to their set of values to their world view to their perspective and they don't trust anybody that contested or challenges it and that's why trump was so revolutionary.
[01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:26.730]  He was somebody representing ordinary people against that structure.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:33.560]  Robert, you have really laid this out for us beautifully.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.640]  Where do you see the power of Harvard and the power of Yale going?
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:43.260]  They parlayed through the British Empire model, Cecil Rhodes model, the Rhodes Scholar model.
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.660]  They all wrote books on this for viewers.
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:48.640]  This is not our opinion, this is all fact.
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.380]  They all parlayed that into a global government.
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:55.920]  But sure enough, the communist Chinese now do not respect the very Anglo-American establishment
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.480]  that sold their people out to them.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.040]  And now China is even trying to basically break those deals militarily and economically.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.040]  And the same thing is happening all over.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:11.160]  And so, I mean, they really should have left power in the West and not tried to undermine
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:20.120]  the West so much just because it was so satanic of the establishment had a problem because
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.640]  the West had somewhat of a Christian ethos.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:28.640]  So there's this overriding drive to extinguish the West and extinguish family values and
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.280]  things because this is such a decadent inbred elite.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:38.080]  I mean, that's my reason that they destroyed their own power and sold themselves out for
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.520]  global domination, which was all a pipe dream.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.640]  Or is there something else there?
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.640]  I think it's a mixed deal.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:50.960]  And I think you still have some Kissinger types who have a sort of clear-eyed view of
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.920]  the world, even if their moral compass has long since been broken.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.720]  But increasingly, you have essentially what you see with the colonial empires when they
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.760]  declined and decayed towards the end, and their recandescence was to disguise themselves
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.720]  as independent revolutionaries.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:11.680]  The reason why they had to go that route was because the empires were decaying because
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:17.720]  the people who ran them were incompetent increasingly, just not capable of being clear-eyed strategically.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:22.460]  Put aside their lack of moral compass or the distortion of that moral compass, they simply
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:27.360]  did not have the competence and capability to see the world clearly and cleanly.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:32.080]  And that is increasingly our entire political class and professional class in academia and
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.080]  entertainment.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.980]  And they lack the will to dominate and control.
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:39.200]  And so instead, they try to just dumb everybody down so they can manage them.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:45.300]  But then they're dumbing down their own personnel and paving the way for their own collapse.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.720]  It's like a fifth generation.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.400]  It's like what Thomas Paine said, that there can't be a divine right of kings, just look
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.440]  at some of their kids.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.600]  They clearly didn't come from God.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:01.940]  And the idea was you can't branch the tree so far, and so you have sort of a cultural
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:07.480]  incest of the intellectual elite that has bastardized their intellectual capabilities
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.840]  and cognitive capabilities to actually be meaningfully important strategists and effective
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:13.840]  ones.
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:14.840]  They're bad at what they do.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.640]  Biden administration is the ultimate example of it.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:21.640]  Biden tripping down the steps was the sign of the decline of the American empire from
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.040]  the goal of the elite, because we have semi competent and incompetent people who didn't
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:30.920]  qualify to ride the short bus to school are running our national security state.
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.420]  And that's the functional reality of where we're at.
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:37.400]  And because of that, that means America is uniquely at risk.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:42.160]  But it also means that foreign powers like China and Russia and others are going to be
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.520]  on the rise.
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.480]  And so we'll see what that world looks like.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:50.600]  But in order for America to bounce back, it's got to purge itself of this incompetent intellectual
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.900]  elite that's not only morally dangerous, it's strategically stupid and just will do dumb
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:00.240]  things like that, like like as we've been doing for a decade now, go into places and
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.700]  think we'll be celebrated only to be hated.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.220]  And this is the mindset mentality of these people.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.080]  This is why they were mocked up in Anchorage.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.080]  They didn't know what they're doing.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.380]  That was my next question.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:14.020]  Why do you think the secretary of state went in there and for the first time in modern
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:15.020]  history got so humiliated?
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:18.100]  I mean, even during the Cold War, Russians didn't talk to us like that.
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:19.660]  We didn't talk to them like that.
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:20.660]  We have nuclear weapons.
[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:25.900]  Biden's saying basically, you know, Putin's an idiot, I'll kick his ass, Russia's about
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.740]  to pay.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.140]  China didn't see that as strong.
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.420]  They suddenly got very belligerent, which obviously they see Russia as one of their
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.780]  main rivals as well.
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:36.420]  China and Russia are not close for those for those who don't know.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.980]  The media actually they're together.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:40.200]  That's a whole nother discussion.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:43.860]  But they really got shocked by that.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:48.760]  And suddenly we heard all these hardline comments from Biden, who just three weeks ago said
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:53.340]  on CNN, hey, you can have Hong Kong, you can have the Uighurs, you can do whatever you
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.340]  want.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:57.400]  Well, then they come and bitch slap the secretary of state.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.900]  Now Biden's talking about he's going to dominate China.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:01.380]  He's going to get them all this.
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:05.700]  I mean, were they really that delusional that they thought kicking America and kicking Trump
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.300]  and kicking Christians was their real enemy?
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:12.380]  And they thought that Xi Jinping was their buddy and they thought groveling to Xi Jinping
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.460]  would make him be their buddy boy.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:17.140]  I mean, do they not even know Chinese psychology?
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:19.560]  I know they don't.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:22.980]  These are people who very much live in a sort of West Wing TV show culture of their own
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.420]  self celebration.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:27.700]  And consequently, they are completely they read The Washington Post for their foreign
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.120]  policy understanding.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.120]  That's where they did.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.340]  That's where they have the same broken moral compass.
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:33.340]  It's an echo chamber.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:34.340]  I know I'm interrupting.
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.340]  You're a genius.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:36.340]  Ten minutes, you got the floor.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:37.340]  I want to hear what you have to say about this.
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:41.220]  And the Suez Canal, you were on a month ago predicting breakdowns in infrastructure.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.460]  The incompetency level is just exploding everywhere.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.420]  And speak to why that's happening, too.
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:53.140]  Yes, I mean, it's because we have basically bred an entire group, an entire generation
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:57.540]  of the diplomatic elite, of the cultural elite, economic and political elite that I saw and
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:00.860]  witnessed when I when I was a freshman at Yale and a sophomore at Yale.
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:05.020]  The beginnings of it, they were basically and it got much worse after I left in terms
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:09.020]  of the millennial generation, but it was bad during even the next generation in terms
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:13.780]  of how these institutions treated dissent, how these institutions treated debate, how
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:16.960]  these institutions tried to curate the mind.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.660]  They did so not only in a sort of controlling manner, but they did so in ways that made
[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:24.020]  be enfeebled them, emasculated them.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:29.260]  And the effect of it, the consequence of it was that you now get to see what's been born
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.260]  from it.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:32.940]  And what's been born from it is people who don't know the rest of the world.
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:36.660]  They really think that they're the stars, that they're the heroes.
[01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:40.620]  No doubt, the secretary of state walked in there blinking, thinking that China would
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:46.000]  stand up and clap and applaud that the adults are back in the room, the important people
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.620]  are back in the room, and that they, the neoliberal elite, should be the ones to rule the world
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:56.460]  and that China would be just enthralled by the privilege of having Joe Biden and Blinken
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:59.800]  back in charge when they had no interest in that.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:05.360]  China had strong disagreements with Trump, but they respected Trump because Trump communicated
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.940]  language that made sense in the international order.
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:12.180]  Trump was going to defend his national sovereignty and American national sovereignty and American
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:17.000]  economic empowerment and the American ideal, just as China was going to defend its Chinese
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.520]  communist model and its ideal so they could respect that even if they hated him because
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.320]  of how successful he had been.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:27.200]  Meanwhile, they just don't have any respect for Biden and Blinken.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:31.720]  These are nitwit lefties who want to come in and give Obama as you said, they make it
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720]  off the back of the plane.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.720]  Oh, precisely.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:38.160]  I mean, the idea that they're going to that a Blinken is going to.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.860]  Well, here's the other problem with woke, woke ism, woke ism undermines the impression
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:43.920]  and image of America around the world.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.340]  It doesn't serve.
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:51.140]  It may serve to divide and conquer within America's politics, but it completely undermines
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:54.840]  America's image to the rest of the world because you can't preach.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:22:01.120]  I mean, that's why the Chinese foreign secretary could mock Blinken about Biden's own statements
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.120]  about BLM.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.520]  He's like, you can't lecture us about the Uighurs.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.480]  You can't lecture us about Hong Kong.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.840]  You said your own country is governed by incorrigible racists.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.840]  And there's no answer.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.080]  There's no comeback because that's what happens.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:19.080]  They've gutted the moral authority of the country by gutting and attacking the idea
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:20.720]  America.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:25.720]  And by doing so for now, 10 years, really, but particularly over the last four years.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:32.480]  And so what we have is a enfeebled and weakened neoliberal, spoiled class of kids.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.120]  And the danger is the way they're going to prove to the rest of the world that they're
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:42.760]  still important, that they still matter in sort of Kissinger's imperialistic continental
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.760]  philosophy.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:44.760]  Real politics.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:45.760]  Exactly.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.600]  An action just for its own sake.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:52.000]  These are people who believe bomb just to bomb, invade just to evade, blow up just to
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.200]  blow up, just to see something happen.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.200]  It's sociopathic in its behavior.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:01.720]  And that's why we're at such high risk of some conflict exploding somewhere around the
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:02.720]  world.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.120]  He's got to distract from the border.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.080]  He's got to distract from these other issues.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.520]  He's got to distract from his.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.880]  I mean, he was embarrassed on one day.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:15.180]  The show The Gaggle with Peter Lavelle, George Samueli called it the Day of Infamy, because
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:20.740]  on one day the United States was embarrassed by North Korea, Russia and China.
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.180]  You had Putin making fun of him, saying, hey, why don't you come debate me?
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.100]  I'm available for the next 48 hours.
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:27.620]  And Biden had to run and hide.
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:31.160]  You have the North Korean leader pointing out all the things the American media won't
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:36.380]  talk about, that Biden's basically mentally derelict and everybody knows he has no mental
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:38.000]  cognitive capacity.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.860]  And then you have China slapping America around on US soil, something that, as you note, never
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:47.040]  even happened during the Cold War with Russia.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.280]  They didn't even do that on US soil.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:55.920]  So that's the degree to which America's esteem is being completely destroyed internationally.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:00.380]  All this talk about how Trump weakened, Trump strengthened America's image because he made
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:04.200]  it powerful and reasonable again in terms of the rest of the world's perception of who
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.240]  he was and what America is.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.980]  Now they know the deep state's back in charge and they don't respect them because these
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.900]  are wokester deep state boys.
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:17.220]  These are people with zero respect amongst all of the rest of the world's powers.
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:20.420]  And they have enough power, they don't have to go along with whatever it is we want.
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:24.380]  So we're going to have a disaster in Iran, a disaster in Ukraine, a disaster in Afghanistan,
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:28.860]  a disaster with Russia, disaster with relations with China, disaster in Taiwan.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:34.900]  That's why China's flying its military planes right over it and ships right around it.
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.100]  It's going to get worse.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:40.580]  And somewhere somebody's going to mistakenly pull the trigger because you have the equivalent
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:43.580]  of three-year-olds who found their kids loaded gun in the basement.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:46.500]  That's who's running our foreign policy and war policy right now.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.780]  They just got humiliated on the world stage.
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:52.820]  And how do humiliated bullies act when they get humiliated?
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:55.460]  They tend to lash out and do something really stupid.
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:25:00.340]  So we're at a particular time of high risk around the world.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:06.500]  And I liken it to a volcanic eruption, populism, the mismanagement, I mean all of it.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:10.420]  And we already have all this eruption, all the earthquakes, and it's clear that bigger
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.900]  things historically are coming.
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:15.740]  And you're not a pessimist usually, I mean you're being honest.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:19.900]  And then the Washington Post comes out, CNN comes out, because you can see the talking
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:20.900]  point the last three days.
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:22.480]  There is no border crisis.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.860]  There are no children.
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.540]  There is no Antifa.
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:29.220]  And then they had to start retracting because they don't have Trump there where everybody
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:31.200]  on their side kind of went along with the lie.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:35.500]  Now people are figuring out that, wait, I'm losing my whole future and I'm being destroyed
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:36.500]  and I'm a joke.
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.380]  I totally agree with you.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.040]  And I've had a lot of other smart people on that I agree with.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.540]  They have to start a war.
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:44.780]  They will start a war to distract from this.
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:47.460]  They will start a giant terror attack or something.
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:48.700]  What else could they pull, Barnes?
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:49.700]  What else?
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:53.300]  Historically, they follow an exact playbook.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:54.900]  And the whole world's going to see through it.
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:58.380]  People are very sophisticated now.
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:25:59.380]  No doubt.
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:01.780]  I mean, I think there's four hot spots around the world.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:06.500]  Ukraine is getting really hot and deeply problematic because if the Ukrainian government is talking
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:10.860]  about basically the Ukrainian president, because he played ball with Biden's people,
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:15.060]  really didn't help Trump ultimately during all of that impeachment nonsense.
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.580]  The oligarchs still run the country.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:20.660]  And so they're talking about invading the eastern, the far eastern part of their country,
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:22.180]  which is basically aligned with Russia.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:26.380]  It's all Russians that live there that has rebelled since the 2014 coup.
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:27.460]  That's going to be a war.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:30.420]  The Russians, that's 80 percent Russian, as you said, they're going to fight.
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.820]  That's the Russian oil fields, the Russian pipelines.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:33.820]  Yeah.
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:35.260]  Russia said we will defend this.
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:36.260]  Exactly.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.820]  And then you have a potential hot war because if the U.S. or anybody from the West gets
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:44.140]  involved, you have two nuclear powers fighting an actual war for the first time since.
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:49.660]  And one thing we always heard that if we started a war that in fifth generational, fourth generational
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:53.660]  warfare, that it would be things like scuttling a ship in the Suez Canal.
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:59.860]  That's in all the textbooks that the next big war would start with sabotaging the Suez
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:00.860]  Canal.
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:01.860]  And now it's there.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:05.540]  I think that's what Tucker Carlson said last night, probably on an accident.
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:06.540]  No doubt.
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:07.540]  And you have multiple.
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:10.620]  They are playing weird games in the Mideast, you know, saying they're not going to back
[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:15.140]  the Saudis in Yemen, but then actually trading all the munitions for Yemen, which is basically
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:19.860]  that's a Yemen is a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which also has Al Qaeda in
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.860]  in Yemen.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:26.000]  All I mean, it's just a potential disaster waiting to happen to happen on top of that.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.060]  You have Bolivia and Venezuela, which is another two other risk points because of how they
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:31.060]  were different.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.740]  Deep state actors want to start another conflict there.
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:38.180]  But I think a place that people are not looking at to watch because this would be like Democrats
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:42.460]  when they go to war, they find some moral cause, some great champion, some bogus, woke
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:45.460]  reason to do so is Ethiopia.
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.460]  There's already been building.
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:47.460]  Oh, yeah.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:51.020]  Remember Sudan when the Lewinsky came out, Drudge posted it.
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:54.420]  So they sent like a hundred cruise missiles into an aspirin factory.
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:55.420]  Exactly.
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:28:00.620]  And some of Biden's key national security people have been talking around D.C. about
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.680]  pay attention to Ethiopia.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:05.920]  So it would be just like him to go to war in someplace like Ethiopia.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.760]  And that's just like Mussolini when he had trouble at home, he invented Ethiopia.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.760]  Exactly.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.840]  And there's already there's the murmurs of it.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.800]  They're building it up for some other crazy country for us to stick our nose in that on
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.600]  paper won't unravel.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.920]  The Middle East won't upset Russia or China.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:27.800]  It'll be just another place to to excuse military power to say, look, hey, we're important.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:28.800]  We're significant.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:29.800]  We still run the world.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:34.680]  Look, we can get us now bogged down in Ethiopia like we're still bogged down in Afghanistan.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:38.120]  And for folks that don't know, Trump got a peace deal in Afghanistan that Biden at his
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:40.320]  press conference said he's not going to honor.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:44.280]  We're going to be there after May 1st, which means we're going to have dead soldiers again
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.000]  in Afghanistan come May.
[01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:53.110]  Obviously, the power structure that put Biden in just knows they want to run America.
[01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:56.050]  They know they've created trillions of dollars of fake debt.
[01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:58.450]  They know they want to consolidate power with their fake lockdown.
[01:28:58.450 --> 01:29:02.350]  Speak of the lockdown and now the Supreme Court judge in England saying we're never
[01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:04.490]  going to end the lockdown or at least 10 years.
[01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:06.890]  Bloomberg saying, yeah, it's an endless pandemic.
[01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:09.890]  It's a new way of life to stop the carbon.
[01:29:09.890 --> 01:29:13.970]  They're now admitting, live in your house, they got big articles out that now your home
[01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:18.730]  assistants when you're at home by law will watch you and control you to make sure your
[01:29:18.730 --> 01:29:19.730]  social distancing.
[01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:24.130]  I mean, they're just announcing a dystopia light years even worse than I thought they
[01:29:24.130 --> 01:29:25.810]  would get done in the next 30 years.
[01:29:25.810 --> 01:29:27.610]  They're moving very quick.
[01:29:27.610 --> 01:29:28.610]  So can you speak to that?
[01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:34.270]  Well, if you go back to last March when we were talking about whether or not if this
[01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:40.170]  was at some level, there was deliberate complicity by the Chinese government and in the in what
[01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:43.110]  happened in the release of it, and we know there was at least some degree because they
[01:29:43.150 --> 01:29:48.290]  lied and hid information, then we would see the evidence of it a year later when the number
[01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:53.270]  one economic beneficiary of whatever policies were instituted would be China.
[01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:58.050]  And as in fact, exactly what happened, China, they released this week that the number one,
[01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:03.430]  the economic beneficiary of the last year of global Western lockdowns has been China
[01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:06.490]  because China quickly stopped doing any lockdown.
[01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:09.710]  They tricked the world to saying, see, this is how you solve the problem.
[01:30:09.710 --> 01:30:15.030]  And while the rest of the world stayed locked down, they completely reopened, got the economic
[01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:19.910]  engines back up and were able to replace the US and other countries in the in critical
[01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:23.510]  supply chains to a degree they never even had before.
[01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:26.510]  And now they have more economic influence than ever before.
[01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:32.010]  And you see the arrogance that comes with that in smacking around America on America's
[01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:34.670]  own soil, as they did in Anchorage.
[01:30:34.670 --> 01:30:41.070]  So what we predicted turned out true because these lockdowns are basically exported Chinese
[01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:46.170]  Communist Party policies that even China refused to follow for very long because they knew
[01:30:46.170 --> 01:30:48.710]  how disastrous they would be.
[01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:52.630]  And the fact that you have Fauci giving in, you know, one minute, if you take the vaccine,
[01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:53.630]  everything's fine.
[01:30:53.630 --> 01:30:56.150]  The next minute, no, you still have to socially distance.
[01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:57.590]  You still have to wear a mask.
[01:30:57.590 --> 01:31:01.250]  It's not even really a vaccine, if that's the case, because that means it doesn't act
[01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:06.490]  as a it's only a therapeutic not acting to prevent transmission like most people perceive
[01:31:06.490 --> 01:31:07.770]  vaccines to be.
[01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:12.490]  So all of this, they're giving inconsistent messages because this Milgram experiment worked
[01:31:12.490 --> 01:31:14.090]  extraordinarily well.
[01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:17.810]  They found they could get the half to two thirds slow down, slow down, because listen,
[01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:19.050]  I care about our regular listeners.
[01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:23.370]  They're the best, but they're the sponsors to like kind of pay us to be the missionaries,
[01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:26.390]  support us to be able to go out and build this infrastructure and reach people.
[01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:31.750]  So I know the audience knows all this, but for but for like 10 percent that's new viewers,
[01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:33.070]  explain Milgram experiment.
[01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:34.070]  Take 10 minutes here.
[01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:37.910]  I know you got to go then, but but take 10 minutes to explain the whole rollout, the
[01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:38.910]  whole psychology.
[01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:41.830]  Klaus Schwab admits it's all a fraud.
[01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:45.430]  If people will just admit to themselves they've been conned, we can turn this around.
[01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:49.270]  So speak about what happened, how they ran it and then how you think we turn it around
[01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:53.830]  now using the Santas and Gnome and others as an example.
[01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:58.230]  Well, it goes back to Michel Foucault, who who described the long change of history of
[01:31:58.230 --> 01:32:02.590]  how we treated people that were insane, how our prisons have totally changed, how we treated
[01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:03.590]  crime.
[01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:08.030]  And what he figured out was why were we creating a prison system that perpetuated a permanent
[01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:09.210]  criminal class?
[01:32:09.210 --> 01:32:11.230]  It's because no crime, no police.
[01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:13.070]  You need crime to justify police.
[01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:18.590]  But however, the fear of foreigners, the fear of domestic crime only got so many people
[01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:20.930]  to forfeit civil rights and civil liberties.
[01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:26.050]  What they've discovered and uncovered is that a scary, invisible virus will get people to
[01:32:26.050 --> 01:32:30.330]  forfeit their liberties in ways they never would have for any other fear.
[01:32:30.330 --> 01:32:33.650]  And that's why they're going to keep repeating it, keep retrying it, keep reexperimenting
[01:32:33.650 --> 01:32:34.650]  with it.
[01:32:34.650 --> 01:32:38.170]  And the Milgram experiment was done where basically they brought people in and they
[01:32:38.170 --> 01:32:41.410]  said, you're part of an important government health project.
[01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:44.850]  And they came in and they just met someone in a white lab coat, knew nothing else about
[01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:45.850]  them.
[01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:48.130]  And the person in the white lab coat said, you're going to sit there and you're going
[01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:52.970]  to decide how much electric shock to give this other person over here based on whether
[01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:55.430]  they answer the right answer or not.
[01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:58.650]  And they and I'll tell you how much electric shocks to give them.
[01:32:58.650 --> 01:32:59.650]  And they would sit there.
[01:32:59.650 --> 01:33:02.570]  Now, they didn't know the other person in the other room was actually an actor.
[01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:04.170]  They thought it was a real person.
[01:33:04.170 --> 01:33:07.570]  And the person in the white lab coat would tell them to keep shocking them higher, higher,
[01:33:07.570 --> 01:33:09.730]  higher, higher, until they could hear the person die.
[01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:11.970]  And by the way, notice we're back at Yale again.
[01:33:11.970 --> 01:33:12.970]  Yes, we are.
[01:33:12.970 --> 01:33:13.970]  Yeah.
[01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:17.530]  I mean, well, remember Ted Kaczynski for people who don't know the Unabomber.
[01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:20.050]  He was created by Harvard, Harvard's MKO.
[01:33:20.050 --> 01:33:21.050]  CIA.
[01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:22.050]  Yep.
[01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:23.050]  Yep.
[01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:24.050]  Exactly.
[01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:25.050]  That's what it was.
[01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:26.610]  I'm going to give you the floor because I want to hear you roll here and I love you.
[01:33:26.610 --> 01:33:30.770]  But I want to explain to a lot of listeners, people on the street go, Jones, you talk so
[01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:31.910]  fast you say all this.
[01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:33.450]  Is it really all true?
[01:33:33.450 --> 01:33:37.890]  That's how me and Robert can finish each other's sentences because he's knowledge, I'm knowledge.
[01:33:37.890 --> 01:33:39.050]  It's the same thing.
[01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:41.450]  So we didn't even prescript these discussions.
[01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:42.530]  He's finishing my sentences.
[01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:46.770]  I'm finishing his because I had all these Yale students want me to say, how do we believe
[01:33:46.770 --> 01:33:47.770]  you?
[01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:48.770]  They found out the CIA.
[01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:49.770]  How do we believe you?
[01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:56.130]  There's a they do rituals because we because Charlotte Iserby's dad and his and his father
[01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:57.130]  were in it.
[01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:59.850]  She released hundreds of their annals to the Senate.
[01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:02.050]  We have damn Senate hearings on this.
[01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:05.450]  You know, it's just crazy how they think that we're so knowledgeable.
[01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:06.790]  We must be faking it.
[01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:08.270]  We're not the Democrats.
[01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:11.010]  We're not Saki up there, not knowing what planet she's on.
[01:34:11.010 --> 01:34:12.570]  We're into the knowledge.
[01:34:12.570 --> 01:34:14.190]  We know what we're talking about.
[01:34:14.190 --> 01:34:17.070]  And if the public gets this knowledge, it's over for them.
[01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:18.070]  Sorry.
[01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:19.070]  Go ahead.
[01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:20.070]  Oh, no, absolutely right.
[01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:25.070]  It was because when I was a young college student, first freshman year out summer in
[01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:29.110]  D.C., I got to organize meetings with all kinds of high powered people just because
[01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:32.990]  I was the head of the Yale political union, which is the Yale version, the Oxford political
[01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.990]  union.
[01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:35.830]  And it was shocking the access I would get.
[01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:40.390]  John Kerry would let me and 10 people sit in his back offices and chat about whatever,
[01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:46.030]  including the fact he was a bones man, along with some other prominent people in town.
[01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:51.230]  The CIA invited us into the core, the CIA director James Woolsey, into the core of the
[01:34:51.230 --> 01:34:54.390]  CIA, where they have a bunch of young blondes running around.
[01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:56.630]  That stereotype is absolutely true.
[01:34:56.630 --> 01:35:00.670]  Where he explained to us how he could kill foreign leaders despite the law prohibiting
[01:35:00.670 --> 01:35:04.790]  him from killing foreign leaders, because he said, well, define what a foreign leader
[01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:05.790]  is.
[01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:07.990]  And he put in quotation marks and smiled at me.
[01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.990]  So I was like, wow.
[01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:10.630]  I mean, the brazenness of this.
[01:35:10.630 --> 01:35:12.910]  But that's because they think you're part of the club.
[01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:16.670]  It was a Planned Parenthood director when I was at Yale organizing a dinner society
[01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:19.350]  with Justice Breyer's daughter at the time.
[01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:22.870]  Breyer just got on the Supreme Court, who sat there and told me what Planned Parenthood's
[01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:24.230]  real agenda was.
[01:35:24.230 --> 01:35:28.270]  And why did why did all these people feel comfortable to say these incredible things
[01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:30.670]  right in front of some kid they just met?
[01:35:30.670 --> 01:35:32.110]  Because I was at Yale.
[01:35:32.110 --> 01:35:37.070]  And so it was presumed that I was part of the club, that I had been pre vetted, that
[01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:40.350]  I had been pre approved, that I had been pre screened.
[01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:41.910]  I call it the Snowden problem.
[01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:46.230]  They worked very hard to keep the Ed Snowdens out, to keep people with a conscience away
[01:35:46.230 --> 01:35:51.490]  from these sources of power, because they know how corrupt and evil they are.
[01:35:51.490 --> 01:35:53.150]  And that's how they operate writ large.
[01:35:53.150 --> 01:35:56.950]  And they often operate in the open if you're in the know.
[01:35:56.950 --> 01:36:00.910]  But they keep everybody else out and in the dark.
[01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:02.870]  And that's how the gaslighting structure works.
[01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:03.870]  And that's how the system works.
[01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:05.110]  And that's how this game works.
[01:36:05.110 --> 01:36:06.950]  But all you have to do is track and trace.
[01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:12.430]  It's no coincidence that the lead, quote unquote, whistleblower in the impeachment of President
[01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:14.710]  Trump, the first one, was a Yale grad.
[01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:16.310]  He was a Yale man.
[01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:20.390]  That meant really he was likely a CIA spook, just undercover at another agency.
[01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:22.590]  That's what that means nine times out of 10.
[01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:25.470]  But it's not a coincidence that he was a Yale man.
[01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:28.950]  They have a group of people who identify in a certain way, look at the world in a certain
[01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:29.950]  way.
[01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:30.950]  They help shape that.
[01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:31.950]  They help curate that.
[01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:33.790]  They help create that.
[01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:36.790]  And they buy off potential sources of dissent.
[01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:37.790]  And anyone that-
[01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:38.790]  That's right.
[01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:39.790]  And I didn't mean to make you digress.
[01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:42.790]  Get back into the plandemic and the scam and how you think their operation is going.
[01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:46.230]  Is it first their Milgram experiment is doing well, but how do we defeat it?
[01:36:46.230 --> 01:36:48.150]  Because now they're announcing permanent lockdown.
[01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:49.390]  We got to get out of this.
[01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:50.630]  And we knew it was coming a year ago.
[01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:51.630]  You were right.
[01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:52.630]  But here we are.
[01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:54.750]  Well, it's worked too well.
[01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:55.750]  That's the scary thing.
[01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:58.370]  In other words, so many people have complied.
[01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:02.790]  So many people have been unable to effectively resist that they were able to achieve things
[01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:04.530]  they probably didn't even think they could achieve.
[01:37:04.530 --> 01:37:09.090]  Not only widespread consent to extraordinary things, I mean, they get parents to not send
[01:37:09.090 --> 01:37:10.370]  their kids to school.
[01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:14.550]  They get their parents to isolate their own kids from themselves.
[01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:15.930]  They get the people to give up their life.
[01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.350]  Can't go see old folks.
[01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:19.850]  They can put people in the nursing homes to kill them.
[01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:22.570]  They can deny health care to everybody and not resuscitate.
[01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:24.930]  I mean, this has just been terrible.
[01:37:24.930 --> 01:37:25.930]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:30.570]  I mean, they got people to completely disconnect from their own family, not affiliate and associate
[01:37:30.610 --> 01:37:35.690]  with other people, not go to political events, not publicly associate, not publicly protest,
[01:37:35.690 --> 01:37:39.370]  not even run their own businesses or go to their own schools or go to church.
[01:37:39.370 --> 01:37:40.570]  I mean, that's the degree of it.
[01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:43.650]  I mean, they achieved something they never thought they could achieve.
[01:37:43.650 --> 01:37:49.090]  And then on top of that, the big tech giants got fabulously rich, not just China, but the
[01:37:49.090 --> 01:37:53.070]  big tech giant, because they were able to replace overnight, they were able to do what
[01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:55.330]  Walmart's been trying to do for 30 years.
[01:37:55.330 --> 01:37:59.930]  They did in one year, which was wipe out millions of America's businesses forever, wipe out
[01:37:59.930 --> 01:38:04.430]  businesses that have been around for over 100 years in some cases, four or five generations
[01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:05.650]  in some cases.
[01:38:05.650 --> 01:38:11.050]  So the scary power they've been able to accumulate because the courts have been deferential and
[01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:16.530]  docile and because so large swaths of the publication of the public have bought into
[01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:22.530]  the nonsense that it's only, but what I find encouraging is two things, more and more and
[01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:26.490]  more people are pushing back and recognizing that this is nonsense.
[01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:27.770]  That's the number one thing.
[01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:32.330]  The court of public opinion keeps shifting more and more and more against the lockdown.
[01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:35.890]  I was about to say the bigger something looks like it's successful at front shows the bigger
[01:38:35.890 --> 01:38:38.170]  the backlash in Newtonian physics.
[01:38:38.170 --> 01:38:39.170]  Speak to what you're saying.
[01:38:39.170 --> 01:38:42.770]  Look, and we're now starting to see it cross party.
[01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:49.210]  So you see Bobby Kennedy Jr. now be an increasing advocate, not only against compelled vaccines,
[01:38:49.210 --> 01:38:53.890]  but also against mask mandates and against lockdown, says it's one of the greatest violations
[01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:57.110]  of civil rights and civil liberties in American history.
[01:38:57.110 --> 01:39:02.070]  So as we start to get crossover political support from the left and the right, that
[01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:06.950]  means the whole edifice will crumble and you have Cuomo in trouble in New York, Whitmer
[01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:09.910]  in trouble in Michigan, Newsom in trouble in California.
[01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:15.390]  So that the face of the lockdowns are increasingly the face of death, demise and destruction.
[01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:19.450]  And that's increasingly recognized by the broader populace and public.
[01:39:19.450 --> 01:39:24.070]  And as the court of public opinion starts to assert itself more collectively, then that
[01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:28.110]  will be the best restraint on this excess of government and state power.
[01:39:28.110 --> 01:39:29.110]  But it's that's right.
[01:39:29.110 --> 01:39:32.750]  This has all been a giant technocracy test in Bill Gates's own words.
[01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:35.030]  And we said it before they said it, but they've admitted.
[01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:37.630]  Why do you think they admit so much of it in their own programs?
[01:39:37.630 --> 01:39:41.170]  I think it's to look confident in front of their own minions that have carried out the
[01:39:41.170 --> 01:39:45.550]  crime to make it look like all this is completely normal.
[01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:48.030]  Well, you see, Bill Gates, basically, this was Bill.
[01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:53.350]  This was much more of a Bill Gates architected plan than a George Soros architected plan.
[01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:54.470]  This was like his ultimate dream.
[01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:58.550]  It turns out, buying off all the public health authorities pretty much around the world
[01:39:58.550 --> 01:40:00.230]  worked wonders.
[01:40:00.230 --> 01:40:01.230]  Explain that.
[01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:05.590]  The Soros CIA plan would be racism, burning cities, hantifa.
[01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:09.350]  But this is the scientists saying, step aside, we'll show you how to do it.
[01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:10.830]  This is the scientific elite.
[01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:13.670]  This was the real A-gamers coming in, wasn't it?
[01:40:13.670 --> 01:40:14.670]  Absolutely.
[01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:15.830]  It's the ultimate control.
[01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:16.930]  It's ultimate control.
[01:40:16.930 --> 01:40:18.230]  That's what Gates is obsessed with.
[01:40:18.230 --> 01:40:20.350]  I mean, frankly, that's what Microsoft is really is.
[01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:22.390]  He wants monopolized control.
[01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:26.070]  I mean, that's why he's been developing all these patents of quantum tattoos and little
[01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:27.070]  chips-
[01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:28.070]  Weather control.
[01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:29.070]  Exactly.
[01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:30.070]  All of it.
[01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:32.910]  I mean, he has remote control chips.
[01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:36.950]  Why do you need a remote control chip in somebody else's body unless you're up to something
[01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:38.110]  that's not good?
[01:40:38.110 --> 01:40:40.150]  But this has been his in the population control.
[01:40:40.150 --> 01:40:43.890]  And it goes back to that conversation to tie it together I had at Yale with the Planned
[01:40:43.890 --> 01:40:44.890]  Parenthood guy.
[01:40:44.890 --> 01:40:48.390]  I mean, it was the same basic plan, and that's where Gates comes from.
[01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:50.630]  It's all about control, control.
[01:40:50.630 --> 01:40:51.630]  They're power freaks.
[01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:52.830]  They're control freaks.
[01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:57.310]  They care more about that than they do money, than they do status, than they do prestige.
[01:40:57.310 --> 01:40:59.150]  They want control, control.
[01:40:59.150 --> 01:41:00.190]  And that's been Gates.
[01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:02.670]  And Gates has achieved that to an incredible degree.
[01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:06.350]  I mean, I'm just waiting for some city to say, in order to prevent the virus, you need
[01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:11.190]  to walk to work by hopping on one foot and barking like a dog and see how many people
[01:41:11.190 --> 01:41:12.470]  actually go out and do it.
[01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:13.710]  Oh, they do it.
[01:41:13.710 --> 01:41:15.470]  They do it.
[01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:16.510]  That's the terrifying thing.
[01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:21.350]  But so for Gates, this has been his ultimate dream and his ultimate agenda and his ultimate
[01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:25.390]  objective, but he's getting increasingly, increasingly exposed.
[01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:30.570]  People who did not know who he was, who did not know what he was up to, now increasingly
[01:41:30.570 --> 01:41:31.570]  do.
[01:41:31.570 --> 01:41:35.550]  And that's where I think there's effective pushback that, you know, just as Infowars
[01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:40.190]  has been the spear of the resistance, the tip of the spear, that the rest of the resistance
[01:41:40.190 --> 01:41:41.610]  has started to follow.
[01:41:41.610 --> 01:41:45.430]  You're seeing people on both the left and the right increasingly question what's going
[01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:49.270]  on, who's behind this, and how is this really in our interest?
[01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:55.150]  When it's the small lefty cafe that's having to close, the small liberal bookstore that's
[01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:59.190]  having to close, the small liberal-owned comic store that's having to close, and they're
[01:41:59.190 --> 01:42:04.030]  telling you, oh, just go to Amazon, everything will be fine, more and more people are waking
[01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:08.590]  up and more and more people are getting red-pilled, and the effect of that will be more effective
[01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:13.510]  resistance against this Bill Gates matrix-driven society that he's tried to institute.
[01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:14.510]  Well, exactly.
[01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:19.270]  It was about a year and a half ago that some filmmakers that worked with Tommy Robinson
[01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:20.910]  had done a good job of an add-on.
[01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:27.630]  We later learned they worked with Hope Not Hate and basically the equivalent of the ADL,
[01:42:27.630 --> 01:42:32.030]  and they came and interviewed me, and they falsely said that I made fun of my listeners
[01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:37.150]  and falsely said that I made an amount of money that we don't make, but they did show
[01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:40.430]  a video the Southern Department of the Law Center put out a month ago that was real.
[01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:42.590]  They just cut the front and the end off of it.
[01:42:42.670 --> 01:42:48.630]  I'm in a studio with lights in a director's chair being interviewed, and I said, devil's
[01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:52.750]  advocate, if I just cared about myself, I'd say I hate Trump, worst thing in my life,
[01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:57.550]  I'm so effing sick of Trump, but I did this because it's for my children in the future.
[01:42:57.550 --> 01:43:02.770]  Well, it's actually on the DVD, what I said, the film, and I think it's powerful, but they
[01:43:02.770 --> 01:43:06.990]  took it out of context to try to say to my listeners, oh, look, he doesn't support Trump.
[01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:11.990]  Well, no, I've said plenty of where I don't support Trump, how he got hoodwinked at first
[01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:15.910]  into supporting the vaccines, how he didn't fight the censorship when he should have,
[01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:19.510]  but I believe he's a good man, the globalist hate, and certainly you see what we've got
[01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:26.630]  now with Biden, but speaking to that, because hindsight's 20-20, but it's also important
[01:43:26.630 --> 01:43:32.350]  to understand history so we don't repeat it, where did Trump go wrong on vaccines?
[01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:36.430]  You have a lot of contacts, you worked with the president, I know.
[01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:38.110]  How did he get manipulated into this?
[01:43:38.110 --> 01:43:40.790]  Why has he doubled down and said, oh, yeah, the vaccines are great?
[01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:46.150]  Is it because he signed on to it, or is he ignorant, or maybe he thinks if he endorses
[01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:47.150]  it, liberals won't take it?
[01:43:47.150 --> 01:43:52.510]  I mean, I don't know, and then why didn't he do something about the censorship when
[01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:54.870]  now it's only getting worse, including him?
[01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:59.150]  I mean, he's in purgatory, he admits he's trying to get out from under this, so how
[01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:00.150]  did this happen?
[01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:05.870]  Well, you can't be a successful rebel general and hire a bunch of establishment insiders
[01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:10.750]  to be all of your colonels and lieutenants, and that's the long and short answer of Trump.
[01:44:10.750 --> 01:44:13.270]  That he put a lot of establishment insiders around him.
[01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:17.710]  He thought he could convince them to go along with his ideas when all they did was use it
[01:44:17.710 --> 01:44:22.310]  to undermine and sabotage his agenda all the way through, gave him bad information and
[01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:23.310]  bad advice.
[01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:27.830]  I mean, it's now come out that they lied to him, the Pentagon repeatedly lied to him about
[01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:31.930]  Syria, repeatedly lied to him about Afghanistan, repeatedly lied to him about a wide range
[01:44:31.930 --> 01:44:36.350]  of subjects, but particularly about troop levels, troop withdrawals, troop movements.
[01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:41.350]  They were lying to the commander in chief on a daily basis for four years, and there
[01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:47.470]  were some of us trying to get that message to him, and unfortunately he conceded himself
[01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:53.150]  with these establishment types such that he was being constantly undermined and sabotaged,
[01:44:53.150 --> 01:44:54.910]  and frankly, it's still going on.
[01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:58.790]  He has people around him that are determining who he's going to endorse that are two of
[01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:02.470]  the most incompetent, corrupt people from the campaign, and he's put them in charge
[01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:03.470]  of it.
[01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:07.950]  That's why we've seen hits and misses with Trump post-presidency, so he's got to get
[01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:12.310]  to a point where it's a natural, it's his strength and his weakness.
[01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:19.110]  He's not from politics, so he doesn't fully understand the inside game, and consequently,
[01:45:19.110 --> 01:45:22.270]  that's where he makes all his mistakes, where he's unfamiliar with something, where he's
[01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:26.670]  not an expert in something, where he doesn't have life history in something is where he
[01:45:26.670 --> 01:45:32.270]  gets misguided, and that's still the case, and it was the case the entire administration.
[01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:33.910]  There was so much promise.
[01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:36.990]  The great failure of Trump was the undelivered promise.
[01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:42.390]  The great success of Trump was where he was able to deliver, but he came up short because
[01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:48.670]  he entrusted too many establishment hacks, too many corrupt insiders to deliver, and
[01:45:48.670 --> 01:45:53.030]  then when he would get concerned with them, he would go with people that were so far outside
[01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:54.830]  they weren't effective.
[01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:59.190]  There were plenty of people that were in that sweet spot, but as soon as he let the system
[01:45:59.470 --> 01:46:04.950]  take out Flynn, then he communicated to the system they could remove anybody who was a
[01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:05.950]  real threat.
[01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:07.390]  You're right, and that's what scared them was they knew he was a good guy that meant
[01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:10.910]  well, and they knew any moment he could get good advice and act on it.
[01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:15.950]  That's why they were so incredibly panicked, but now look at the crisis of who they put
[01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:16.950]  in.
[01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:17.950]  What do you think happened with Biden?
[01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:21.990]  They knew he was old, controllable, corrupt, under Chinese control, but he obviously, once
[01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:27.830]  he was already in, had more minor aneurysms, had some more strokes, completely gone now.
[01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:29.270]  He's like milk that went bad a month ago.
[01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:30.950]  I mean, it gets worse by the minute.
[01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:35.110]  How do you see them extricating themselves from that crisis?
[01:46:35.110 --> 01:46:39.230]  They see Biden as perfect, as long as the world cannot know that it's weekend at Bernie's
[01:46:39.230 --> 01:46:44.830]  and he's functionally, cognitively dead as a policy man.
[01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:50.430]  What it is, basically you have an empty 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and that's perfect for
[01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:51.430]  the deep state.
[01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:55.190]  That means they just get to run the show, and all they've got to do is blow a leaf across
[01:46:55.190 --> 01:46:57.710]  Biden's desk and he'll sign it.
[01:46:57.710 --> 01:47:04.010]  There's no clue in Biden, no pushback in Biden, probably less pushback than any president
[01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:07.190]  in deep state post-World War II history.
[01:47:07.190 --> 01:47:09.190]  This is a literal rubber stamp.
[01:47:09.190 --> 01:47:14.650]  Absolutely, and that's why they love him, and they just have to dodge and survive him
[01:47:14.650 --> 01:47:18.030]  staying up past one o'clock in the afternoon and talking to somebody.
[01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:22.830]  Because he will then be blamed in history for what the globalists have done.
[01:47:22.830 --> 01:47:25.450]  This is a national security crisis.
[01:47:25.450 --> 01:47:27.390]  No doubt about it.
[01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:31.710]  While they have confidence, and Kamala Harris was the deep state candidate, they don't think
[01:47:31.710 --> 01:47:33.670]  Kamala is well-liked.
[01:47:33.670 --> 01:47:37.270]  That's why they're going to leave Biden in as the figurehead as long as they possibly
[01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:38.270]  can.
[01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:39.270]  They just need him.
[01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:41.310]  That's why they don't let him talk to any foreign policy leaders.
[01:47:41.310 --> 01:47:42.870]  That's why there's only very controlled-
[01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:45.590]  And they're in the bubble where as long as the Washington Post and New York Times say
[01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:49.630]  he's the smartest, greatest guy ever, has the body of an 18-year-old, they're believing
[01:47:49.630 --> 01:47:51.190]  their own BS.
[01:47:51.190 --> 01:47:54.170]  Completely, and they've convinced themselves of it.
[01:47:54.210 --> 01:47:57.930]  That's what was shocking about what happened in Anchorage, is it showed the disconnect.
[01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:01.650]  The American establishment political elite really buy their own BS.
[01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:05.650]  They've sold themselves an ad, and they actually believe their own imbubbled world, and they
[01:48:05.650 --> 01:48:09.290]  don't realize the rest of the world has not been successfully gaslit.
[01:48:09.290 --> 01:48:15.130]  That's why Putin made the joke, I wish Biden very good health, making it obvious the guy's
[01:48:15.130 --> 01:48:17.230]  derelict and he's a dementia candidate.
[01:48:17.230 --> 01:48:20.450]  Why am I going to worry about what some dementia guy thinks?
[01:48:20.450 --> 01:48:24.650]  He's an embarrassment of America to the rest of the world, but he's perfect for the deep
[01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:25.650]  state.
[01:48:25.650 --> 01:48:30.130]  As long as they can keep the American populace in the dark, enough of them, then that will
[01:48:30.130 --> 01:48:32.210]  be the path they keep going down.
[01:48:32.210 --> 01:48:36.370]  Barnes, you have blown me away in the last 15 minutes.
[01:48:36.370 --> 01:48:40.530]  Tell people where they can find you, some of the other shows you host, and then just
[01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:44.250]  spend five minutes as I've been asking questions on anything else on your radar that you think
[01:48:44.250 --> 01:48:46.530]  we should be aware of.
[01:48:46.530 --> 01:48:47.690]  Sure.
[01:48:48.650 --> 01:48:51.410]  I created a backup site for me and another lawyer.
[01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:57.210]  We do various TV shows and podcasts at Dave Rubin's Locals to create an independent, separate
[01:48:57.210 --> 01:49:03.530]  space that's subscriber-driven, that has a very low $5 fee, that's designed to get rid
[01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:09.770]  of the trolls, but also bring in people for curated conversation that's free of censorship.
[01:49:09.770 --> 01:49:11.490]  I own the information on there.
[01:49:11.490 --> 01:49:14.210]  I own all the content I create, et cetera.
[01:49:14.210 --> 01:49:20.130]  You can find that at vivabarneslaw.locals.com, and that's where if anybody wants to look
[01:49:20.130 --> 01:49:22.690]  up other additional information, they can.
[01:49:22.690 --> 01:49:26.330]  We're going to move forward across the board at the political resistance.
[01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:30.170]  I brought suits on behalf of people who've been discriminated against based on their
[01:49:30.170 --> 01:49:35.450]  disability under these mask mandates that violate discrimination laws and disability
[01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:40.010]  discrimination laws, and we've already brought several, and we're bringing more.
[01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:43.690]  We're bringing cases that challenge various aspects of the lockdown.
[01:49:43.690 --> 01:49:46.930]  We're going to bring cases that challenge the Fed.
[01:49:46.930 --> 01:49:51.010]  In order to audit the Fed, we got to sue the Fed first and use the Freedom of Information
[01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:54.930]  Act to do it, doing so with George Gammon.
[01:49:54.930 --> 01:49:58.850]  We're going to do what we can in the legal arena and the political court of public opinion,
[01:49:58.850 --> 01:50:02.490]  the courts of law, the courts of judges and juries to try to make as much difference as
[01:50:02.490 --> 01:50:05.690]  we can, but it's going to be up to ordinary, everyday people.
[01:50:05.690 --> 01:50:09.810]  Part of the way they do this, clearly, the tip of the spear throughout, go back and look
[01:50:09.810 --> 01:50:16.050]  at who was on it in March about the risk of lockdowns, who was leading the then protest
[01:50:16.050 --> 01:50:22.610]  against these lockdowns, explaining Bill Gates' essential role going all the way back to November
[01:50:22.610 --> 01:50:27.910]  of 2019 in terms of what he was planning and plotting.
[01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:31.770]  That has always been Infowars, and that is why the continued support of this audience,
[01:50:31.770 --> 01:50:37.350]  making sure this independent platform survive big tech censorship, survive big tech algorithmic
[01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:44.150]  suppression, survive big media attack, survive organized corporatized lawfare, survive all
[01:50:44.150 --> 01:50:48.590]  of this, survive the true ... Before there was Parler, there was Infowars.
[01:50:48.590 --> 01:50:53.910]  That was the biggest tech attack on any independent media platform anywhere in the world, and
[01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:59.770]  yet Infowars survive to get out and thrive, to get out these critical messages because
[01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:04.070]  of the Infowars audience, and the way that happens is by supporting Infowars.
[01:51:05.070 --> 01:51:10.710]  You can get healthier, wealthier, and wiser by going to InfowarsStore.com and buying products
[01:51:10.710 --> 01:51:12.910]  that I buy and use every day.
[01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:17.950]  When I start my day, I get fresh orange juice, I put in winter sun, I put in the Ultra 12,
[01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:22.030]  I put in some turmeric, and that's how I start my day, and then I use Brain Force early on
[01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:24.950]  in the day, and then use Knockout to help go to sleep.
[01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:26.030]  All these things are good for you.
[01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:27.030]  They're healthy.
[01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:28.030]  They make you healthier.
[01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:31.390]  They make you wealthier because they're more affordable than the competition, but at the
[01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:35.790]  same time, they make you and the rest of the world wiser, and that's why it's the Infowars
[01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:41.830]  audience that has kept freedom of press alive during this extraordinary time period, and
[01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:46.390]  it's going to be up to that audience to continue to do so, to share the links, to share the
[01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:51.470]  information, to educate the rest of the world so that we're able to maintain a meaningful
[01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:57.790]  resistance against this form, this true oppressive oligarchy of the Bill Gates types that would
[01:51:57.790 --> 01:51:58.790]  like to rule us.
[01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:59.790]  Absolutely.
[01:51:59.790 --> 01:52:00.790]  We all called it.
[01:52:01.190 --> 01:52:02.190]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:52:02.190 --> 01:52:04.990]  They have The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, calling hundreds of
[01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:07.390]  people trying to say, how are they still on air?
[01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:08.390]  Shut them down.
[01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:09.390]  Shut them down.
[01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:10.390]  The answer is simple.
[01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:13.590]  A great audience that cares and understands that they are literally supporting us to get
[01:52:13.590 --> 01:52:17.590]  information they're already aware of out to others because we're willing to tell the
[01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:19.030]  truth and never back down.
[01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:21.270]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much for all the time.
[01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:23.790]  Look forward to speaking to you very, very soon, my friend.
[01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:24.790]  Absolutely.
[01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:25.790]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:26.790]  Wow.
[01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:27.790]  Really appreciate him coming on.
[01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:28.950]  I got on air late today.
[01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:32.390]  I appreciate him staying late and moving some appointments to get on with us.
[01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:34.390]  That was very, very important.
[01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:39.390]  These Saturday shows, I call them commercial-free, but we got to take some breaks so I can reset
[01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:42.030]  here and get ready to cover the big issue.
[01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:43.590]  Why have I had volcanoes on screen today?
[01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:44.590]  Well, it's big on the news.
[01:52:44.590 --> 01:52:49.190]  It's very interesting, but it's also a metaphor for where we are as a society and where we
[01:52:49.190 --> 01:52:50.190]  are as a world.
[01:52:50.190 --> 01:52:54.670]  So I'm going to come back and break that down in a final statement, and then we're going
[01:52:54.670 --> 01:52:58.230]  to premiere the 50-minute interview.
[01:52:58.230 --> 01:53:03.190]  I did two weeks ago, but we haven't aired this yet because we dolled it up, had a lot
[01:53:03.190 --> 01:53:06.150]  of interesting information with Roger Stone.
[01:53:06.150 --> 01:53:08.590]  So we'll end with Roger Stone, his path to victory.
[01:53:08.590 --> 01:53:11.030]  Oh, and that's the thing I forgot to ask Barnes.
[01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:13.310]  I'll get him on this week coming up.
[01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:18.230]  I was going to tell him we've got this Roger Stone path to victory video coming up and
[01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:22.410]  that somebody's got to develop a plan and I want to get your plan for victory because
[01:53:22.690 --> 01:53:28.450]  I've been meeting with a lot of high-powered Republicans, the top names, and they're all
[01:53:28.450 --> 01:53:31.090]  trying to create a plan to save the country.
[01:53:31.090 --> 01:53:32.090]  It's about saving Republicans.
[01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:33.730]  It's not about any of that.
[01:53:33.730 --> 01:53:35.690]  We can all instantly sell out to the globalists today.
[01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:37.170]  They're always like, why don't you sell out?
[01:53:37.170 --> 01:53:38.170]  Why don't you sell out?
[01:53:38.170 --> 01:53:39.170]  Sell out to Satanism?
[01:53:39.170 --> 01:53:40.530]  Sell out to your cronies?
[01:53:40.530 --> 01:53:44.970]  Sell out to your stupid Yale and Harvard clubs and the CFR and the Trilateral Commission
[01:53:44.970 --> 01:53:46.930]  and all your pervert, pedophile crap?
[01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:47.930]  No.
[01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:48.930]  I'm sorry, man.
[01:53:48.930 --> 01:53:49.930]  I've seen the globalists.
[01:53:49.930 --> 01:53:50.930]  They look like demons.
[01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:51.930]  They look like they're in hell.
[01:53:52.450 --> 01:53:55.690]  I'm going to be part of that, but I cannot be on air without your support.
[01:53:55.690 --> 01:53:57.050]  So the special ends this Wednesday.
[01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:58.050]  It's got to end.
[01:53:58.050 --> 01:54:03.810]  Free shipping on all those items, all the Emmerich Essentials, all the iodine, X2, X3,
[01:54:03.810 --> 01:54:10.690]  all of those products, the eucalyptus and the peppermint and of course the other organic
[01:54:10.690 --> 01:54:14.170]  hand sanitizers are all there.
[01:54:14.170 --> 01:54:19.890]  Brain Force Plus, the great nootropic, Cabochil, regular extra strength, Libing Defense, it's
[01:54:19.890 --> 01:54:26.650]  all 50% off with free shipping, the big blowout sale, and it ends by Thursday morning at InfowarStore.com.
[01:54:26.650 --> 01:54:31.810]  So I'm glad that Martin's brought that up because I've just done over two hours and
[01:54:31.810 --> 01:54:33.970]  not talked about that.
[01:54:33.970 --> 01:54:40.330]  So we're going to take a quick break and we are going to come back.
[01:54:40.330 --> 01:54:43.690]  You know what I want to air because this explains it.
[01:54:43.690 --> 01:54:44.210]  Let's air.
[01:54:44.290 --> 01:54:51.330]  Let's air the piece, the short three-minute, 29-second piece on why the Yellowstone Super
[01:54:51.330 --> 01:54:52.990]  Volcano could be huge.
[01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:57.130]  This is years old, but it ties in to what we're going to be talking about when we come
[01:54:57.130 --> 01:54:58.130]  back.
[01:54:58.130 --> 01:55:01.490]  So here it is, and I'll have my final comments, and then Roger Stone, thanks for joining us
[01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:04.530]  on the Saturday Transmission, and thank you for the key capital.
[01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:09.170]  You've got word of mouth, share the live feed, share the archive video, it banned out video
[01:55:09.170 --> 01:55:14.050]  on your email, your text message everywhere, we'll be right back.
[01:55:14.050 --> 01:55:20.490]  Recently, scientists have collected new data, giving them a better picture of Yellowstone's
[01:55:20.490 --> 01:55:23.570]  underground plumbing.
[01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:32.210]  Right beneath the caldera from the last eruption sits the magma chamber, and it's fed by a
[01:55:32.210 --> 01:55:40.410]  plume of magma stretching down 465 miles northwest into Montana.
[01:55:40.410 --> 01:55:47.970]  It's mostly solid rock with the potential to liquefy, and scientists are closely monitoring
[01:55:47.970 --> 01:55:48.970]  it.
[01:55:48.970 --> 01:55:55.730]  Magma, or molten rock, is rising through the plume into the magma chamber at two inches
[01:55:55.730 --> 01:55:57.870]  a year.
[01:55:57.870 --> 01:56:01.750]  There's no reason for it to stop, although it might come in spurts.
[01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:07.910]  Our images show wider parts and narrower parts, so it's like slugs of material that are flowing
[01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:09.550]  in a sewer line.
[01:56:09.550 --> 01:56:15.550]  And this restless Yellowstone caldera is truly living, breathing, and every once in a while
[01:56:15.550 --> 01:56:19.690]  it burps.
[01:56:19.690 --> 01:56:25.790]  The danger is if the plume starts liquefying and moving up at a faster rate.
[01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:30.830]  Natural systems can throw us a lot of curveballs, a lot of things can happen that we're not
[01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:33.269]  really ready for.
[01:56:33.269 --> 01:56:37.990]  Scientist Jake Lowenstern is looking for a pattern connecting the supervolcano today
[01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:49.630]  and its three prior major eruptions, 2.1 million years ago, 1.3 million years ago, and 640,000
[01:56:49.630 --> 01:56:50.630]  years ago.
[01:56:51.390 --> 01:56:56.790]  In two of the really large eruptions at Yellowstone, so much material comes out, entire mountain
[01:56:56.790 --> 01:57:01.310]  ranges end up falling into the ground and essentially disappearing.
[01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:10.830]  One 50-mile stretch of mountains simply disappeared by collapsing into the magma chamber.
[01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:16.230]  University of Toronto geologist John Westgate has tracked the ash from Yellowstone's prior
[01:57:16.230 --> 01:57:19.130]  eruptions.
[01:57:19.130 --> 01:57:25.610]  It covered much of the United States, it occurs right out of the Pacific Ocean, it even found
[01:57:25.610 --> 01:57:27.330]  in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:31.769]  Up in northeast Montana there's a site that we're working on, the temper is over seven
[01:57:31.769 --> 01:57:34.490]  meters thick.
[01:57:34.490 --> 01:57:41.210]  These eruptions are enormous, the amount of material erupted from them, huge.
[01:57:41.210 --> 01:57:47.370]  When Mount St. Helens erupted in May 1980, it blew off one side of the mountain and triggered
[01:57:47.370 --> 01:57:53.890]  an avalanche of snow, mud, ash, and rock.
[01:57:53.890 --> 01:58:01.650]  Driven by the wind, the ash landed in 11 states and up into Canada, but that's nothing compared
[01:58:01.650 --> 01:58:07.470]  to the amount of ash from Yellowstone's last three major eruptions.
[01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:16.390]  In magnitude and volume, each one was far greater than Mount St. Helens.
[01:58:16.410 --> 01:58:22.430]  Today there's little evidence of the supervolcano's violent past.
[01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:29.030]  The 50-by-30-mile caldera from the last eruption was covered by lava and ash and smoothed over
[01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:32.030]  by glaciers.
[01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:34.269]  Forests now conceal the scars.
[01:58:36.970 --> 01:58:44.810]  I wanted to air that piece from years ago about the Yellowstone super volcano because
[01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:51.490]  we forget how volatile this planet, the universe is, and just how incredibly energetic our
[01:58:51.490 --> 01:58:56.810]  solar system is because of our sun, but also the Kuiper belt, also the asteroid belt, and
[01:58:56.810 --> 01:59:02.650]  then all the objects that are even planetary size, not just comets that also come through
[01:59:02.650 --> 01:59:05.090]  that aren't part of our overall solar system.
[01:59:05.210 --> 01:59:09.730]  We're in a very, very busy part of the universe, even though we're two-thirds the way out
[01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:14.770]  on the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy in a sea of trillions, trillions of galaxies.
[01:59:14.770 --> 01:59:21.290]  It's just amazing that we're able to consciously look out and behold the fact that we're on
[01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:28.150]  a little piece of dust orbiting a central part of basically an atom.
[01:59:28.150 --> 01:59:34.750]  But here we are, and you have to understand that the creator of the universe can just
[01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:40.030]  basically hit one button and all this civilization and all the trappings of power and all the
[01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:46.710]  things that the system tries to build up to pretend like it's God burns up in seconds.
[01:59:46.710 --> 01:59:50.910]  And so the Skull and Bones group and the New World Order and all these people try to play
[01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:54.710]  God, but they're not God.
[01:59:54.710 --> 02:00:00.030]  They don't know why I was in Connecticut on another mission, and I don't know why for
[02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:03.630]  the first time in my life I went to Skull and Bones and it was on 322.
[02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:08.070]  That's serendipity, that's synchronicity, that's destiny.
[02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:10.070]  But also I'm not part of any secret society.
[02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:14.110]  I'm not part of the CIA, I'm not part of Skull and Bones, I'm not part of any of these groups
[02:00:14.110 --> 02:00:20.590]  where the system tries to get together and organize the smartest people to have control.
[02:00:20.590 --> 02:00:24.110]  But I am part of God's society.
[02:00:24.110 --> 02:00:27.990]  And that's why without ever being trained or even told to do these things I do, I do
[02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.990]  it.
[02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:33.350]  And then I discovered my ancestors basically all did it as well, and as they got older
[02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:38.150]  they learned the secrets that I'm now learning that it's ethereal, it's God, it's we're all
[02:00:38.150 --> 02:00:39.150]  connected.
[02:00:39.150 --> 02:00:43.990]  It's the same way a hummingbird can fly from Florida across the Gulf of Mexico, across
[02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:50.270]  the Caribbean, 3, 4,000 miles to South America and have its babies and then fly back with
[02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:55.630]  those babies to Florida or fly back with those babies to Texas or New Mexico or California
[02:00:55.630 --> 02:00:56.630]  or Mexico.
[02:00:56.630 --> 02:00:59.550]  How does a little hummingbird know?
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:10.300]  How do geese fly from Canada all the way down to Mexico in the fall?
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:15.680]  There are universes, dimensions, everything around us now proven mathematically that the
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:22.840]  ancients already understood that we're interfacing with and even in our third dimension we only
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:25.920]  are able to pick up a tiny spectrum.
[02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:34.050]  Of the reality in the third dimension people ask when they go down these caves and there's spiders that are blind and there's
[02:01:34.469 --> 02:01:38.389]  Salamanders that are blind and fish that are blind because you don't need eyes in the dark
[02:01:38.389 --> 02:01:40.889]  But the fish can tell where walls are
[02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:46.269]  The fish know where entrances are that they're they're more agile than fish out in the regular water
[02:01:46.630 --> 02:01:53.450]  Because they've got something else. They've got psychic sonar ladies and gentlemen because the third eye can see
[02:01:53.810 --> 02:02:05.610]  God. And all of these Satanists want to play God. As we float on sheets and mountains of
[02:02:05.610 --> 02:02:08.510]  stone only 10 miles thick.
[02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:19.849]  On top of liquid magma they've got two mile deep mines in South Africa where it gets up
[02:02:19.849 --> 02:02:24.130]  to 130 degrees 104 degrees they gotta bring giant air conditioners and freezing water
[02:02:24.130 --> 02:02:27.090]  down with them spraying them as they dig the diamonds out of the earth.
[02:02:27.150 --> 02:02:33.469]  Well, then how do you have bases three miles under?
[02:02:33.469 --> 02:02:36.030]  You have a three mile tall island, a mountain.
[02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:41.790]  You can then at sea level burrow in and it's 65 degrees inside, 69 degrees.
[02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:46.389]  But as you go deeper, it gets hotter because of that pressure.
[02:02:46.389 --> 02:02:53.349]  And when the tyrants oppress us and try to control us, they build that explosive pressure.
[02:02:53.349 --> 02:02:56.830]  So God is not a sadist, but God is.
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:04.680]  God is interested in consciousness and has created new beings that are conscious and
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:08.360]  who have the potential to do incredible things, but we had to be given free will, so we're
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:09.360]  allowed to be bad.
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.840]  I have four children.
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:13.900]  They're great children overall, but they do some bad things, and I get really frustrated
[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:14.900]  with them.
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:15.900]  I know more than they do.
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:20.540]  I wish they'd listen to me, but someday they'll know what I know and they'll mature.
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:24.120]  It's part of the process, and that's what God's done with us.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:26.880]  But there are some people that do not mature.
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:32.480]  People like Bill Gates, people like Oprah Winfrey, people like Ted Turner.
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:38.200]  They are angry, envious, jealous, evil people.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.040]  And so what does 322 really stand for?
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:44.360]  Well, it's an Egyptian sun calculation that goes into the sun temple calculation of 666,
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:50.600]  and it's a mathematical equation, but if you go to Genesis 322, please, King Geng's version,
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:56.600]  if you guys can pull that up, Genesis 322, it is, they take the man taketh of the tree
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:02.200]  of life and is given the knowledge not just of good, but of evil, learning evil systems,
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:05.360]  evil manipulations, scams, frauds.
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:13.160]  And once that was introduced into the man, they say, do not let him have the other fruit
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:15.800]  lest he be like us and never die.
[02:04:15.850 --> 02:04:24.850]  So the devil says you eat of the fruit you become God, no you were pure and with God
[02:04:24.850 --> 02:04:29.050]  before and now once you eat of the fruit and have the knowledge of evil as well, now you
[02:04:29.050 --> 02:04:36.170]  must be shut off because if not you will never die.
[02:04:36.170 --> 02:04:39.710]  And evil needs to be walled off, it doesn't need to be given unlimited power in the universe.
[02:04:39.710 --> 02:04:43.970]  You choose to spiritually die, that's why they call it a tomb because they go there
[02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:47.010]  to die and not to be reborn.
[02:04:47.050 --> 02:04:52.770]  But to stay in death.
[02:04:52.790 --> 02:05:00.630]  And the fruits of what they deliver are death and damnation and hell.
[02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:05.600]  Go to the first, it's the best way to show the verse.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:09.420]  Go to the first of my Skull and Bones report to band out video along with my other films
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:13.360]  on Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, The Order, Death, and Dark Secrets, Simon and Graham.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:16.760]  Just pause the first of the video just because it has it good up there for the King James
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:17.760]  version.
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:24.360]  First five seconds of the video, Alex Jones confronts Skull and Bones, if you just put
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:28.640]  it on screen and you can see right there the King James version.
[02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:34.900]  That I want to read yeah just back it up ten seconds past that oh I get it you have
[02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:40.460]  another version that doesn't have that added to it luckily I just so happen to have it.
[02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:43.550]  There it is.
[02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:51.490]  The Lord God said since the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil he must
[02:05:51.490 --> 02:05:55.270]  not reach out and take from the three of life eat and live forever.
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:57.280]  You
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:11.680]  so these individuals are literally stealing everybody's future and trying to play god and
[02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:16.800]  trying to keep people from maturing going through a process they want to arrest you as a child they
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:21.280]  want to rape you as a child they want to damage you as a child to hold you with them into eternity
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:25.760]  and hollywood knows this where they tortured and raped a little girl to death on the set
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:30.559]  until her guts were ruptured on the film poltergeist
[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:37.660]  and in that film there's a satanic priest who takes the whole families and
[02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:40.940]  a whole group out of the desert because he wants the children's souls and has
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:45.200]  them killed in the desert so he can bind their souls to him forever and it's an
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:51.820]  allegory of Satan so that's it for this transmission I appreciate the crew
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:55.940]  coming in and doing a superlative job I tell you the worst thing I'm thinking
[02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:59.740]  about the global is shutting us down is thinking about disbanding this crew we're
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:02.260]  having to cut their pay or having to do any of that and I don't want to do it
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:06.420]  so please realize we're taking the globalist on a point-blank range I'm
[02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:10.380]  willing to take on the secret establishment I want to do it but you're
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:13.660]  our firepower you're our energy you're our will you're the blood of this
[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:19.300]  operation the brains the guts the the sinews the bones you're everything so go
[02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:22.780]  to info war store calm want to thank you all for your support over the years but
[02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:26.179]  doesn't matter if you don't have a dime it's okay tell folks about band on
[02:07:26.179 --> 02:07:30.019]  video and info wars calm and say you've heard it demonized the forbidden truths
[02:07:30.019 --> 02:07:35.219]  there the globalist takeovers there and the plans for victory are there and info
[02:07:35.219 --> 02:07:39.780]  wars calm or band on video our backup sites Europe wars calm news wars calm
[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:44.179]  and others visit one of the sites under hack attack and down just go to one of
[02:07:44.179 --> 02:07:47.700]  the others realize this is such a war this is such a fight things are so
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:51.340]  serious now and people are now more ready to wake up than they've ever been
[02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:55.740]  all right here's the Roger Stone interview and we're gonna air this today
[02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:59.980]  right now and then till it loops till 4 p.m. tomorrow and where you got Owen
[02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:03.099]  Schroyer and Jason Jones and others coming in I'm gonna spend some time with
[02:08:03.099 --> 02:08:06.660]  family tomorrow but you know I'll be there just in case anything unfolds I'll
[02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:10.260]  come in all right let's go ahead and go to Roger Stone in Florida or interviewed
[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:13.660]  him about a week and a half two weeks ago
[02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:22.019]  so Roger if anybody's got a political crystal ball it's you the hard left
[02:08:22.019 --> 02:08:26.340]  can't get over it they're they're devastated that I'm not dead or dying my
[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:31.420]  very famous Richard M Nixon ball I would like to move on to review what went
[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:37.340]  wrong in 2020 and how we can fix it so that the next two elections 2022 and
[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:42.900]  2024 are viable this place is not a dump this is history I escaped the deadly
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:47.340]  snare set for me by Adam Schiff and Robert Mueller for the first time in
[02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:52.460]  American history you have control and censorship of all mass communications in
[02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:57.780]  the United States whether it's cable TV network TV clean out the weak need wine
[02:08:57.780 --> 02:09:03.940]  swelling green pants wearing gutless factless country club Republican geeks
[02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:08.500]  we can crush the rhinos in primaries they have to be cleansed from this party
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:13.260]  here is Roger Stone counterpunch which is what he does best and I'll be very
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:17.780]  clear if Donald Trump's running I'm foreign 100% if you can't break the
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:21.820]  blockade on information then we can never win another election here here
[02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:26.460]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong ladies and gentlemen this is history
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:28.740]  happening
[02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:50.460]  the most banned network in the world we're here at the Miami headquarters of
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:55.260]  the stone cold truth calm with Roger Stone formerly the headquarters of the
[02:09:55.260 --> 02:10:00.139]  Miami office of Infowars until Roger had to stop hosting the show because he
[02:10:00.139 --> 02:10:04.740]  was indicted for thought crimes which he was later falsely convicted of in a
[02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:09.660]  kangaroo court and of course pardoned by the 45th president states and Rogers
[02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:13.740]  always riveting on air he's always accurate in what he's laying out and
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:17.460]  thought-provoking but I'll be honest with you I'm gonna put my spot here the
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:21.900]  stuff he really knows and what he really says behind the scenes is so cutting and
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:27.139]  so accurate and dead on and to save the country today I think Roger's gonna go
[02:10:27.139 --> 02:10:29.500]  ahead and be honest about what happened to Trump and what he told me was gonna
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:32.580]  happen to Trump which did happen to Trump and we're also gonna give the
[02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:35.900]  great General Flynn I know you're good personal friends with advice is we need
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:39.740]  him we need him to also listen to your political research and background
[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:44.139]  because we've got to get him in the game now and so much more and then of course
[02:10:44.139 --> 02:10:47.340]  we're gonna do some future shows that you want to get into the history of the
[02:10:47.340 --> 02:10:50.660]  globalists and and and the Bilderberg because when I first met you like eight
[02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:54.860]  nine ten years ago I forget now it was at a big JFK conference in DC and so you
[02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:57.980]  have a real forte written a lot of best-selling books on these subjects and
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:03.139]  my only criticism when you were working for us was please stop getting you know
[02:11:03.139 --> 02:11:07.019]  on the Russian thing but I got got later they tried to frame me for it and my dad
[02:11:07.019 --> 02:11:09.940]  for it and try to put you in prison that you were actually right you were
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:13.059]  fighting for your life I thought it was really a joke until they actually went
[02:11:13.059 --> 02:11:16.179]  ahead with it and it's a joke now they're trying to frame us for January
[02:11:16.179 --> 02:11:19.420]  6th there's no evidence in fact it's to the contrary but they're still going
[02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:22.500]  ahead and the new Attorney General says they probably plan to go ahead with it
[02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:26.620]  no no it's extraordinary Alex the bloodlust the hatred the viciousness the
[02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:32.139]  maliciousness look by the grace of God I escaped the deadly snare set for me by
[02:11:32.139 --> 02:11:36.380]  Adam Schiff and Robert Mueller and the hard left can't get over it they're
[02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:40.540]  they're devastated that I'm not dead or dying that I'm still here and back at
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:44.820]  the ramparts they hate that but that said the same people who said for two
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:49.019]  years I was a Russian spy working with Julian Assange now say I was involved in
[02:11:49.019 --> 02:11:52.820]  the illegal actions at the Capitol on January 6th it's a lie there's no
[02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:55.900]  evidence to prove that I've categorically denied it it's a smear have
[02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:59.660]  no motive it's preposterous why would we destroy ourselves like this well it's
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:03.019]  because they hate us and therefore they would like to frame us having framed me
[02:12:03.019 --> 02:12:07.380]  before I can tell you they have the capability and it's the it's the it's
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:12.700]  the intersection between Twitter you see once the bloodlust level at Twitter gets
[02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:18.620]  to to what's the word critical mass then the New York Times editorial board and
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:22.380]  the reports you know said they jumped right on it Twitter calls the tune so if
[02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:26.019]  Stone and Jones did something illegal according to the nuts on Twitter
[02:12:26.019 --> 02:12:30.260]  suddenly the New York Times is out pushing that line facts be damned the
[02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:33.980]  Washington Post CNN so we see the same thing over and over again it's the same
[02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:39.460]  fraud that it was last time Roger Stone still did nothing wrong and I can tell
[02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:42.660]  you before I took it as a joke you got really pissed at me privately you said
[02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:46.139]  listen Jones it isn't a joke they plan to put us all in jail later I learned
[02:12:46.139 --> 02:12:50.580]  they were going through all my stuff later subpoenaing all the same crap and
[02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:53.700]  I was like oh you're actually right it was just so preposterous because I was
[02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:56.980]  there when Assange wouldn't give you the time of day when you were trying to you
[02:12:56.980 --> 02:13:00.620]  know talk through intermediaries Credico I was I mean I've been there every step
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:04.860]  of the way I was there at the Capitol and just to watch them try to frame you
[02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:07.620]  and I again it's just crazy well particularly in view of the fact that on
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:12.420]  Election Day at midnight the Justice Department by court order was forced to
[02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:16.620]  release the last remaining unredacted sections of Robert Mueller's incredible
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:19.940]  report in which he admits there was never any factual evidence whatsoever
[02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:24.540]  about Stone the Russians WikiLeaks or even John Podesta's emails which I knew
[02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:28.580]  nothing about and again if people say our fans our listeners they know that
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:31.780]  the reason it's important for them to know is a lot of the public doesn't know
[02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:35.700]  and they don't understand this is one of the most corrupt incidences in world
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:40.940]  history of an entire major country's federal police force and its judiciary
[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:45.980]  knowing people are innocent Trump and then Stone and others surveilling them
[02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:49.500]  illegally lying about it to Congress lying about it to courts then getting
[02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:52.400]  caught and not getting in trouble well the point of course is that past is
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:55.820]  prologue they're gonna do it again they've done it once and now I fear they
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:59.660]  will seek to do it again that means I have to gin up my legal defense fund
[02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:03.139]  I've got to go back on offense I would like to move on and talk about how we
[02:14:03.139 --> 02:14:07.740]  save the country I would like to move on to review what went wrong in 2020 and
[02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:14.179]  how we can fix it so that the next two elections 2022 and 2024 are viable and I
[02:14:14.179 --> 02:14:18.219]  just and I just made you digress into that I apologize let's get into what we
[02:14:18.219 --> 02:14:22.019]  do now but obviously they're trying all this again to keep us back in Trump land
[02:14:22.019 --> 02:14:26.179]  to keep us back with false charges so that you and I and General Flynn and
[02:14:26.179 --> 02:14:30.019]  others can't be leaders into the future so let's do what they don't want and
[02:14:30.019 --> 02:14:36.900]  let's talk about 2022 2024 and your amazing grasp because I've seen behind
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:39.660]  the scenes a lot of times you don't want to scare people you don't want to
[02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:43.219]  depress people you've been very real with the president he was way behind you
[02:14:43.219 --> 02:14:48.040]  said he was gonna lose then you said he okay he's actually but by his sheer will
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:52.740]  himself despite them siphoning off 80% of the money Republicans have raised he
[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:56.460]  is gonna end up winning but then they're gonna steal it and I watched all of that
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:00.580]  unfold exactly as you said they were gonna do it you said he's got to have
[02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:04.219]  the federal marshals go in day one and seize the computers in Nevada and
[02:15:04.219 --> 02:15:07.540]  Arizona and the states where they're gonna steal it and he would have done
[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:10.420]  that he would have the proof that all gone to jail but they didn't and that's
[02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:13.099]  why they freaked out in the New York Times Washington Post and said we've
[02:15:13.099 --> 02:15:16.660]  got an arrest stone he's calling for Trump to declare martial law you said no
[02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:20.180]  such thing you said when they steal it hills how they're doing he's gonna have
[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:24.620]  to cut right in and seize the evidence that's exactly right but again they they
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:29.780]  have one narrative look Trump only won in 2016 because of the rise of the
[02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:35.139]  vibrant robust alternative media based in the you know in the Internet it
[02:15:35.139 --> 02:15:38.540]  didn't matter that the network television was against him half of
[02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:42.740]  cable world was against him most of the print media was against him most of the
[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:49.420]  mainstream net based reporters were against him but just with that Internet
[02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:54.620]  freedom of social media he was able to prevail now let's fast-forward to 2020
[02:15:54.620 --> 02:15:58.780]  what's the difference well they've consolidated on cable so now cable is
[02:15:58.780 --> 02:16:03.099]  almost monolithically anti-trump so for the first time in American history you
[02:16:03.099 --> 02:16:07.940]  have control and censorship of all mass communications in the United States
[02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:12.940]  whether it is cable TV network TV half of radio radio is the last frontier of
[02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:17.260]  freedom and they're trying to smash us there don't kid yourself you you give
[02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:21.740]  better speeches on radio your speeches are a plus your your your radio is a
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:25.019]  plus but your speeches are dynamite take ten minutes are all interrupt address
[02:16:25.019 --> 02:16:31.500]  folks on where we are how to defeat this takeover 2022 2024 well I think that
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:35.700]  things have to be done in a certain order in other words if you can't break
[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:40.420]  the blockade on information then we can never win another election because as
[02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:45.460]  Abraham Lincoln said public opinion is everything so if you can't rally public
[02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:49.779]  opinion if you can't get the Patriots to support your point of view because you
[02:16:49.779 --> 02:16:54.060]  can't communicate with them you can't reach them then all is hopeless so those
[02:16:54.060 --> 02:16:56.980]  who say we've got to jump in and change the state election laws there's not a
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:17:01.779]  chance that you can get the the critical mass among the public to do that under
[02:17:01.779 --> 02:17:06.740]  the current rules of censorship so first and foremost even playing within their
[02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:12.340]  it within their construct you can have platforms on the internet which are
[02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:17.740]  very difficult to de-platform and if they're controlled by Patriots who are
[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:22.100]  open to all points of view then you'll have no censorship that's step one if
[02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:26.060]  you cannot achieve that don't even think about the next three steps which
[02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:30.860]  are fixing the state election laws to guarantee transparency and integrity
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:37.820]  step three clean out the weak-kneed white wine swelling green pants wearing
[02:17:37.820 --> 02:17:43.400]  gutless feckless country club Republican geeks who were quick to invite Donald
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:46.380]  Trump to their fundraiser and desperately needed his endorsement but
[02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:49.940]  then turned on him like the rats that they are they have to be cleansed from
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:53.820]  this party this party is the party of working people now this party is the
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:57.940]  party of Trump it is the party of America first more important it's not
[02:17:57.940 --> 02:18:03.860]  about a person it's about an idea and that that idea the America first wing of
[02:18:03.860 --> 02:18:09.500]  the party is still in the ascendancy we can crush the rhinos in primaries but we
[02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:13.500]  have to have a purpose there's no point in nominating a good candidate for
[02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:16.820]  president and I'll be very clear if Donald Trump's running I'm for him a
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:21.100]  hundred percent he can count on me I will be there I hope the same people
[02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:24.300]  who ran the last campaign don't run the next campaign because the only good
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:28.380]  thing about Donald Trump's campaign was Donald Trump okay now we're to that
[02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:33.840]  point and you don't even though you know they screwed Trump over and you think it
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:37.380]  reflects somewhat bad on Trump to show he was screwed no it doesn't it shows
[02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:41.460]  how he like a lion fought back in your own words give them the real data dump
[02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:44.480]  you've not given anybody tell them what really happened you give me big
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:48.840]  briefings you predicted it all you you told General Flynn this you told
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:53.180]  everybody you told Trump this explained to everybody what really happened so we
[02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:56.840]  don't repeat it well I think that there's a couple things early in the
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:00.200]  Trump administration I told the president that internet censorship was
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:04.039]  in my opinion the number one problem that stood in the way of his re-election
[02:19:04.039 --> 02:19:08.800]  I underlined the historic role that it played in his original victory because
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:13.200]  without the internet freedom that we enjoyed in 2016 he would never have won
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:17.480]  nothing has changed in other words the same networks the same cable networks
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:21.600]  the same talking heads the same leftist intelligentsia that was attacking him in
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:27.560]  2016 attacked him with the same ferocity in 2020 but in 2016 he had a platform
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:31.440]  from which to counter punch which is what he does best and they slowly cut
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:34.080]  all that away but but let's get into so he doesn't get repeated again with other
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:37.119]  Republicans that they that the Republican establishment which Trump's
[02:19:37.119 --> 02:19:40.720]  gotten wise to it's why you want them fundraising his name right now they
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:44.600]  swindled the money and hardly any of the money raised for Trump went to Trump
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:49.000]  well first of all the president raised a billion dollars a billion dollars which
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.720]  is really formidable he was a great fundraiser and he had the confidence of
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:57.320]  the business community because he brought us a record economy the problem
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:00.520]  is that as a general rule of thumb in all campaigns whether you're running
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:03.160]  for the Austin City Council or whether you're running for president of the
[02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:09.039]  United States 80% of your of your campaigns funding should go into voter
[02:20:09.119 --> 02:20:15.039]  communications it could be cable advertising network advertising digital
[02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:21.520]  advertising minimum 80% not bureaucracy voter voter mail phone calls voter
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:27.560]  contact not overhead not consultants not bureaucracy and so on the the Trump
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:32.760]  campaign has the inverse 600 million dollars gets transferred to a holding
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:37.360]  company controlled by Jared Kushner the rest of it is it basically squandered
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:45.560]  so when COVID hits and pre-pandemic Trump is leading Biden by nine post
[02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:50.039]  pandemic he's trailing Biden by nine when a trained professional looks at
[02:20:50.039 --> 02:20:53.800]  that polling what you figure out is the only votes that moved are African
[02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:57.680]  Americans and Hispanics essentially all other voters remained in place your
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:21:01.440]  target only them because you were made doing really well with them prior to the
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:04.760]  pandemic and you've lost ground which means they don't hate you because they
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:09.600]  were already for you once you have to reconvince them so for example in some
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:14.440]  polls pre-pandemic Trump was getting a third of the African American vote just
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:18.840]  beneath it and the in the end he did not finish there because his campaign didn't
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:22.520]  spend any resources there which again was not done by accident this is 101
[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:26.800]  failure sabotage well you know what Trump is such a great candidate and he
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:32.320]  was and he was he was particularly hampered by COVID-19 and I was looking
[02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:36.760]  at this way they always ran last time in this went traditional campaign against
[02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:42.960]  him they censored him on the on the on all media platforms they trashed him in
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:47.440]  paid advertising starting September all the way to the end at saturation levels
[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:54.200]  normally no human being could overcome that but he overcame in 2016 Jeb Bush as
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:57.760]  you may remember dropped a hundred million dollars of negative advertising
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:04.000]  Donald Trump and he he was able to respond to it in real time in interviews
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:07.960]  without spending a dollar that that's theoretically not possible but he did it
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:15.360]  this time I believe that his set piece rally format which is where he excels
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:20.880]  forcing the media to cover what he had to say in Milwaukee or in or or in
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:26.360]  Detroit or in Philadelphia or in Richmond or wherever he is when Trump
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:30.320]  can't talk when Trump can't hit the road the campaign is frozen and they now
[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:36.279]  know that that's why in 2021 banned off all social media banned off YouTube he
[02:22:36.279 --> 02:22:39.800]  had but he needs to get out and give more speeches than just the one he gave
[02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:43.279]  at CPAC don't you agree I do agree but let's be very clear when he breaks out
[02:22:43.279 --> 02:22:47.440]  of this construct for the last 30 days he does the same thing he does in 2016
[02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:52.200]  he's a closer so he's nine down now he's seven down now he's five down now he's
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:57.200]  three down I'm convinced that Trump most likely passed Joe Biden Biden of
[02:22:57.200 --> 02:23:02.720]  fear hard work it was probably stolen the point is he didn't need millions of
[02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:06.440]  dollars to win he didn't need it 2016 let's talk about this what can he do now
[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:11.340]  will he be healthy enough looks like it to run again gut level he looks like I
[02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:15.240]  think he's a fighter I think if he can think that he's led a movement to try to
[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:19.320]  fix election fraud and at the state level so the Democrats can't repeat this
[02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:23.560]  again that I think he may run again I think he is gonna run again well I knew
[02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:27.000]  both of his parents they lived into their 90s they were vital into their 90s
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:32.680]  he's got extraordinary stamina he's from good stock he's very angry as he should
[02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:37.000]  be about being censored about being what he believes is cheating there's
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.279]  certainly evidence of anomalies and irregularities in the elections and no
[02:23:40.279 --> 02:23:44.400]  saying that is not treasonous it's not seditious it's a reasonable question
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:47.080]  protected by Democrats said they were gonna challenge the election no matter
[02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:52.600]  exactly but again it's the it's the two-tiered justice system so if the
[02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:56.039]  president wants to run he will be unstoppable for the nomination and to be
[02:23:56.039 --> 02:24:00.600]  the strongest part candidate that the party could field but if he doesn't feel
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:04.779]  if he doesn't fix the structural problems that cheated him out of victory
[02:24:04.779 --> 02:24:09.160]  in 2020 he's not going to be able to win in 2024 if he goes into the same level
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:14.440]  of of net censorship and media censorship the same corrupt state
[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:19.800]  election laws the same gutless Republican Party that doesn't really go
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.200]  to work for him then I don't see how he wins if he fixes those things he's
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:28.160]  probably our strongest candidate or if those things get fixed I guess I should
[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:31.680]  say and he could be just as important energizing the states energizing a
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:36.039]  liberty movement energizing on America first election integrity movement and
[02:24:36.039 --> 02:24:40.279]  then inter-general Flynn I know you're close friends with him I know that when
[02:24:40.279 --> 02:24:44.240]  you both went through the very same attack you guys were big communicators
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:48.320]  over the phone and I know that you guys have obviously talked since then I see
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:54.720]  Flynn if Trump decides not to as really being one of the great hopes you know
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:57.680]  Matt Gaetz is excellent I also see Josh Hawley is great from
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:01.600]  Missouri but pulling back from this talking about general Flynn and just
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:05.000]  being honest because he'll end up watching this I know you've advised him
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.840]  privately I had a chance to talk to him quite a bit I'm not gonna get into all
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:10.800]  the details of it it's not secret but I'm not gonna talk about it yet at this
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:15.200]  point but this is a real former head of defense intelligence and then the former
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:18.920]  national security adviser the president he was their number one enemy when Trump
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:23.000]  first got in because they knew he was a good guy and that he could basically put
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  an America first group of people in the White House in the Pentagon that would
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:31.240]  have been able to defeat the deep state so up front getting rid of him was how
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:34.600]  the dominoes as you said began to fall these are your own words the whole thing
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:41.440]  came out of that but getting Flynn I think to understand that he's got to
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:45.279]  just get out there and say I'm pushing an America first agenda I'm gonna push
[02:25:45.279 --> 02:25:49.360]  for voting integrity which he's already doing and getting him to then basically
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:53.640]  go ahead and rally the troops and be the George Washington we need to have Trump
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:57.119]  up there but I think having Flynn out there as well it isn't who were for
[02:25:57.119 --> 02:26:01.720]  Trump or Flynn I think you get both horses on the field both horses start
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:05.680]  running harder than they can combine their strengths later so what is your
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:10.200]  advice to the world what is your advice to Flynn about this window that Flynn
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:14.240]  has to start getting mobilized to move forward because I know from your advice
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:17.080]  you've given him these listen to him leave it at that and I'm not much you
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:21.000]  get into here but you know a certain point this stuff's got to be public well
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:25.080]  first of all I have the highest possible regard for General Flynn I would never
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:29.039]  actually reveal confidential conversations we've had I think it's the
[02:26:29.039 --> 02:26:33.320]  way gentlemen operate but I do think his greatest public service lies ahead
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:38.560]  I do think that we're not saying the private communications and mine
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:42.140]  neither I'm so happy to tell you what I think which I'm saying he needs to we
[02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:45.279]  need to go start getting going here well first of all I'm for Trump I want to be
[02:26:45.279 --> 02:26:49.119]  very clear about that but I do think we need to have a we need to have a backup
[02:26:49.119 --> 02:26:53.160]  in case the president decides not to run four years a very long time Trump's
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:57.000]  gonna start making money again we know how he like five shotguns in my closet
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.560]  by my bedroom I got the one I'm gonna go for and I got others exactly I love
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:04.980]  this shotgun best but in case there's a problem exactly it's not like we're we
[02:27:04.980 --> 02:27:08.820]  need that horse ready to go so I do think General Flynn has the stature to
[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:13.640]  be a to be a voice for the American first agenda there's gonna be competition
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:17.200]  for this because there are a lot of you pointed out two guys that I really like
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:22.080]  and I'm very interesting at Matt gates who's very popular here in Florida who's
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:26.320]  just a ball buster I mean the guy is he's fearless he takes on the left he
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:29.920]  pulls him down the hill by the hair he's not afraid to brawl he's not afraid
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:33.279]  to mix it up it's hard to name another Republican that that's true of other
[02:27:33.279 --> 02:27:38.440]  than Donald Trump I like Josh Hawley I think he's got great promise I know all
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:41.400]  the moderate Republicans who are my friends in Missouri hate him that tells
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:46.039]  you he's a really good guy so I think they're more afraid of him and then that
[02:27:46.039 --> 02:27:50.720]  even Rand Paul or or even Ted Cruz why are they because right because Josh
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:54.400]  Hawley it was all due respect to Rand Paul who I love and Ted Cruz who I'm
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:59.760]  skeptical about Josh Hawley has a personality he's an attractive guy he's
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:02.320]  very charismatic he's got charisma same thing with Matt
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:06.640]  Gates also super smart I mean look you could theoretically the president does
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:10.880]  a Holly Gates ticket well if the president doesn't run you could have
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:15.000]  four candidates from Florida alone Rick Scott says he's going to run the senior
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  senator what about DeSantis oh god there's so much new blood man DeSantis
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:23.160]  is doing a very good job as governor I think Matt Gates is more telegenic I
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:27.880]  think he's more charismatic I think that's definitely true I think DeSantis
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:31.119]  is more cerebral you couldn't have two candidates from the same state that's
[02:28:31.119 --> 02:28:34.560]  anything illegal no it's not illegal but you can't count the electoral vote
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:38.800]  twice so you would have to forego the electoral vote in the ballot for vice
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:42.760]  president is that you can't get Florida no you would be giving it away
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:47.360]  electorally so but but what has traditionally happened of course is that
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:52.080]  candidates have actually moved so as to not to have that situation but what's
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:56.320]  beautiful is you've got just as smart as DeSantis but more telegenic and
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:59.520]  better-spoken Matt Gates but the DeSantis has really good instincts I
[02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:04.000]  think he's done a good job as governor why does he have such good instincts
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.720]  well it's an excellent question he wasn't even a Trump supporter no no he
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:11.240]  was not a Trump supporter in 2016 look I'm pleasantly pleased with the job he's
[02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:15.880]  done on COVID-19 on internet censorship now his proposal is Laura Loomer writes
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:19.920]  a terrific piece today it's not perfect it's a step in the right direction I
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:23.240]  think that more aggressive actions can be taken by the states to ensure
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:27.720]  fairness and no censorship you know by these internet companies they're getting
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:34.240]  enormous tax write-offs tax credits tax incentives billions of dollars but they
[02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:38.200]  shouldn't be able to strangle the opinions of citizens so I totally agree
[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:40.440]  and we've this has already been a wide-ranging interview about what
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:42.920]  happened previously what you're predicting is coming what you think
[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:47.160]  people should do obviously I want Trump he's the big trillion pound gorilla I
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:51.520]  mean that in a good way that we need to do this so what should Trump if you were
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:57.520]  advising Trump what should he do on election integrity on the open border I
[02:29:57.520 --> 02:30:05.039]  mean he's really the real president who's been sent into exile in my view
[02:30:05.039 --> 02:30:07.560]  what should Trump be doing right now I think the most effective thing for him
[02:30:07.560 --> 02:30:10.680]  to do is to constantly provide a running critique of the Biden
[02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:14.480]  administration their performance and prepare and compare it to his
[02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:18.400]  performance on the same issues whether it's immigration or job creation or wage
[02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:21.560]  growth doesn't matter what the issue is but should they do that with like a
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:24.560]  weekly press conference or something instead of just a little text message
[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:28.640]  here statement there well I mean look there's been a lot of speculation the
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:33.279]  president may be on the cusp of forming his own media organization he'd have a
[02:30:33.279 --> 02:30:37.119]  huge following overnight if he did that he had millions of followers he should
[02:30:37.119 --> 02:30:41.480]  have left Twitter long ago it was a mistake to leave all your eggs in that
[02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:45.600]  basket I think that has hurt him somewhat he met famously with Brad
[02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:51.200]  Parscale his fired campaign manager supposedly the president has asked Brad
[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:54.880]  to take some of that money he got and maybe finance this new platform which
[02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:58.560]  would be a good way not to get sued we're not being mean here but let's talk
[02:30:58.560 --> 02:31:02.400]  about Brad Parscale let's talk about Charlie Kirk let's talk about these
[02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:07.039]  Republican fundraisers that giant heavy pockets you don't have heavy pockets you
[02:31:07.039 --> 02:31:10.720]  can barely pay your your medical bills I don't have the heavy pockets I used to
[02:31:10.720 --> 02:31:14.039]  I spent on the war for Liberty I'm not mad at Charlie Kirk or a part skills
[02:31:14.039 --> 02:31:18.119]  but come on guys you sell you can sell the Lambos well you know I'm gonna
[02:31:18.119 --> 02:31:21.800]  there's a distinction there Brad Brad Parscale has no political skills and I
[02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:25.520]  think there should be a full audit of all the spending by the Republican
[02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:29.200]  National Committee soft money and hard money now let's wait let's wait to get
[02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:32.720]  that audit I think there's gonna be a lawsuit I think some major donors the
[02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:35.200]  Republican National Committee gonna bring a suit to get that information
[02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:38.640]  let me clear I don't think part skills is a bad guy these an idiot but Charlie
[02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:41.880]  Kirk is a different is a different case Charlie Kirk is someone I like Charlie
[02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:45.920]  Kirk really went to bat for justice in my case and therefore I have no
[02:31:45.920 --> 02:31:50.279]  criticism I was honored to go to his founders dinner I do think that their
[02:31:50.279 --> 02:31:53.520]  agenda is somewhat different I already has 37 million dollars I hear the same
[02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:55.840]  thing which means he's a great fundraiser and they do a good job
[02:31:55.840 --> 02:32:00.240]  wonderful put it in the war well those guys are in the war if I mortgage my
[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:04.720]  house to keep my operation going he needs to spend that 37 million he's on
[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:07.800]  the he's on the forefront every day you can see him out there I'm not gonna
[02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:12.279]  criticize criticize Charlie Kirk he's not the same as we are but he's a
[02:32:12.279 --> 02:32:16.720]  patriot Pascal on the other hand is a grifter he believes in nothing and I
[02:32:16.720 --> 02:32:19.880]  don't think he did a good job for the president I don't want to see it where
[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:22.880]  the money went by the way you told me that five years ago you said this Brad
[02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:26.520]  Parscale is gonna be the problem well look he got this reputation is a
[02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:31.400]  brilliant digital strategist from 2016 let's be very clear only one guy elected
[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:36.440]  Donald Trump 2016 Trump his instincts his gut instincts his his combativeness
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:41.240]  his courage his willingness to go toe to toe and say to Hillary Clinton when she
[02:32:41.240 --> 02:32:45.360]  says to him we can't have a man like Donald Trump running the Justice
[02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:49.960]  Department he says yeah because you'd be in jail I know that moment it was over
[02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:53.600]  tell me Jeb Bush would have had the cojones to say that I was a knockout
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:57.920]  bloke it really was and it tells you try it shows Trump had his audacious you
[02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:01.720]  know fearless best no country club Republican would have delivered that
[02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:07.119]  can you see Marco Rubio delivering that devastating put down not a chance
[02:33:07.119 --> 02:33:11.119]  bubble party a Rubio not a chance let's get into it here and then you're gonna
[02:33:11.119 --> 02:33:14.920]  give us an amazing tour of this piece of history you're like oh yeah look at this
[02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:19.560]  dump this place is not a dump this is history the photos the stacks of
[02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:24.360]  documents the articles the art pieces I mean this stuff is just absolutely
[02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:28.600]  incredible a lot of its original well look many of these items either things
[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:32.160]  that I collected at the time I mean there's there's a poster here of Richard
[02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:38.320]  Nixon that I actually pried off of a lamp pole in New Hampshire in 1968 I
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:42.080]  still have it framed on the other hand I bought some of this stuff for a song at
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:46.039]  eBay I'm a collector of political memorabilia we have an association
[02:33:46.039 --> 02:33:49.800]  Nixon's your favorite though well you got Trump to run I have the largest
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:53.039]  Nixon memorabilia collection probably in the United States the question is what
[02:33:53.039 --> 02:33:57.240]  will I do with it when I move on ahead as they say you got Trump to run and he
[02:33:57.240 --> 02:33:59.880]  did it himself you want to take credit but you're they admit you're the genesis
[02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:02.480]  point that's why I went after you that's on record that without you probably
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:06.560]  would have done it and but we've talked privately you love Trump here's like
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:09.880]  there's something that we're like oh but Richard Nixon you knew Reagan you you
[02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:13.440]  know so many you hate the bushes even though you helped him later you attacked
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:16.760]  him when it wasn't popular right the heights of their power why do you love
[02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:21.320]  Nixon so much well because he was indestructible because he was resilient
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:25.420]  because he his story is a story of resilience and persistence it's like an
[02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:28.740]  American story what was it Vince Lombardi said it doesn't matter how
[02:34:28.740 --> 02:34:31.380]  many times you get knocked down it matters how many times you get up he
[02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:35.260]  said they counted this guy out four times he was deader than Kelsey's nuts
[02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:39.940]  done finished washed up a national joke but he still came back and he never ever
[02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:45.060]  gave up in his quest for the presidency and it's a monumental presidency the
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:48.260]  left buries all of his accomplishments now the way they want to bury Trump's
[02:34:48.260 --> 02:34:51.740]  accomplishments so wouldn't Nixon's almost an example for Trump what if
[02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:54.700]  Nick if Nixon had all the stuff Trump had I think Trump's gonna run to be
[02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:59.340]  president again well I mean look I always thought Trump was more like
[02:34:59.340 --> 02:35:03.700]  Reagan in terms of his charisma and his personal charm and the whole you know
[02:35:03.700 --> 02:35:08.440]  atmospherics of his candidacy but he was also pragmatist like Nixon Nixon Trump
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:12.860]  was interested in results tell me how we get more jobs tell me how we employ more
[02:35:12.860 --> 02:35:16.240]  people tell me how we get justice into our criminal justice system he's
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:19.900]  interested in results he was practical so he's not really an idol by the way
[02:35:19.900 --> 02:35:24.060]  you've wished Biden well even though he stole it he's there you care about the
[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:30.180]  country man open borders butchering the dollar gas prices exploding so Roger if
[02:35:30.180 --> 02:35:33.960]  anybody's got a political crystal ball it's you what do you see happening with
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:40.140]  Biden and what do you see unfolding there was a 25th amendment or the vice
[02:35:40.140 --> 02:35:42.740]  presidency what happens there with Kamala Harris well first of all I think
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:46.460]  it's important to understand that there's a revolution within the
[02:35:46.460 --> 02:35:49.779]  Democratic Party there's an epic struggle between their liberal but
[02:35:49.860 --> 02:35:54.300]  corporate wing and the socialist wing the hardcore left wing and that's going
[02:35:54.300 --> 02:35:57.660]  to right now Biden was the only candidate they could nominate who could
[02:35:57.660 --> 02:36:01.039]  kind of bridge that gap which wasn't that difficult to bridge because they
[02:36:01.039 --> 02:36:06.300]  have one thing in common they really really hate Donald Trump so that's why I
[02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:10.180]  think Biden was probably in the end their broadest candidate in terms of
[02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:15.500]  support now senator Harris is not a political rookie she was Attorney
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:19.779]  General she won a US Senate seat in a tough state but she's required to go to
[02:36:19.779 --> 02:36:24.100]  lunch once a week with Susan Rice while Susan Rice tutors her lectures are I'm
[02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:28.820]  told on the fine points of foreign policy I understand Senator Harris finds
[02:36:28.820 --> 02:36:31.820]  this offensive because she's been a member of the US Senate and she knows
[02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:35.420]  what she thinks and she's a pretty smart cookie she doesn't need Susan Rice to
[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:39.820]  tell her what to think she could very well if you believe the actuarial tear
[02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:44.500]  tables end up as president of the United States but you already see the
[02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:48.619]  globalists trying to assert their future control to project their control
[02:36:48.619 --> 02:36:52.660]  and through these puppets though the real presidents these stooges who is
[02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:58.020]  their main controller is it Obama well we know one thing somebody sent me video
[02:36:58.020 --> 02:37:03.260]  of the jury forewoman in my case entering the Obama compound in Calorama
[02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:07.740]  during my trial isn't that interesting yeah I think that as you know it has
[02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:12.260]  been a great tradition Alex for former presidents leave Washington they get out
[02:37:12.260 --> 02:37:15.740]  of politics George W Bush no favorite of mine but he went out to paint
[02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:20.900]  portraits you know it is somewhere outside of Dallas in his bathtub right
[02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:27.460]  but not Barack Obama he stays and moves to a compound compound he maintains a
[02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:30.740]  political staff and he maintains the presence and he's actually said openly
[02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:34.900]  yeah if I could have gone for a third term I would have well I think he did I
[02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:38.900]  think the Obama administration apartment I think the Biden administration is
[02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:44.619]  Obama 3.0 I totally agree with you we're gonna do a tour here in a few
[02:37:44.619 --> 02:37:48.500]  minutes you thought you'd lost this photo I mean I've never seen this photo
[02:37:48.500 --> 02:37:52.260]  there's so much stuff here that's never before been seen this is a big piece of
[02:37:52.260 --> 02:37:56.260]  history with some close shots later that's you and William F Buckley and
[02:37:56.260 --> 02:37:59.860]  somebody else tell us about this photo so in this particular case Bill Buckley
[02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:04.520]  was recording radio commercials attacking Republican Lowell Weicker to
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:08.420]  the benefit of Senator Joe Lieberman because conservatives who lived in
[02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:11.980]  Connecticut my native state could determine that Joe Lieberman was
[02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:16.180]  actually more conservative than left-wing Republican rip-on society
[02:38:16.180 --> 02:38:20.720]  member Lowell Weicker and the Buckley's and the Weickers had a long-standing
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:25.980]  dispute out of Yale so Bill Buckley went to the forefront of Republicans for
[02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:30.020]  Lieberman and I wrote Lieberman I wrote the spots and we're recording there
[02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:35.340]  Ian Wineshell was the engineer very good guy Bill was charming but he also drank
[02:38:35.340 --> 02:38:40.500]  I would say two bottles of wine during the during the the 45-minute taping so
[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:44.660]  he's very aristocratic he poured away a lot of alcohol and he held it well let
[02:38:44.660 --> 02:38:48.820]  me say that so he was doing those interviews what was the name of his show
[02:38:48.820 --> 02:38:54.260]  on PBS firing line man he could tell he was wasted in those well you know
[02:38:54.260 --> 02:39:00.660]  alcoholism ran in the family actually but he still is I think the the modern
[02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:04.779]  avatar of respectable conservatism in other words you strip away the
[02:39:04.779 --> 02:39:08.860]  old-fashioned anti-semitism the racism because we're not anti-semitic and we're
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:14.300]  not racist it was a new brand of conservatism I think was positive
[02:39:14.300 --> 02:39:18.900]  unfortunately it morphs into neoconism and that's where you leave me off me
[02:39:18.900 --> 02:39:22.460]  was just communist light well Buckley had a relationship with the CIA this is
[02:39:22.460 --> 02:39:27.300]  not a secret on the other hand nobody was a greater champion of that's like
[02:39:28.180 --> 02:39:33.180]  Walmart the CIA is everywhere yes it's true it's not some elitist it's like I
[02:39:33.180 --> 02:39:38.340]  have a relationship with you know brown tables I mean it's like they always act
[02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:42.820]  like it's some big vaunted no no it's like Roger Stone and the oath keepers
[02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:46.820]  both brush their teeth before going to bed isn't this whole thing clear to you
[02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:52.539]  yet please it's a joke well I'm not bragging but I mean we have a CIA reach
[02:39:52.539 --> 02:39:55.980]  out to you to me everybody else asking what we think I mean we're we're
[02:39:55.980 --> 02:40:00.260]  Americans are leaders a schoolteacher educating children somebody running for
[02:40:00.260 --> 02:40:04.300]  mayor who wins somebody that writes an incredible book someone that cooks an
[02:40:04.300 --> 02:40:08.020]  incredible cake bakes a cake I mean that's what makes the world go it's not
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:12.140]  the CIA and this magic group up there I mean Roger you don't toot your horn
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:15.420]  you've been a major thought leader for decades and decades explain to people
[02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:18.740]  that there's not like some magic secret intellectual group up there that it's
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:22.900]  we the people well first of all I think two things there is a there is a global
[02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:27.420]  it's definitely a deep state and they are not motivated by ideology they're
[02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:32.060]  motivated by their desire for control and money raw power raw control and
[02:40:32.060 --> 02:40:36.380]  they're canny so in other words they can back back an african-american liberal
[02:40:36.380 --> 02:40:40.740]  like Barack Obama for president and then they can back a faux conservative like
[02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:44.700]  George W Bush for president when the time is right they control both parties
[02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:48.619]  prior to Donald Trump come they don't want us an awakening to that control
[02:40:48.619 --> 02:40:51.460]  there's no question about that and that's why Trump was so dangerous to
[02:40:51.460 --> 02:40:56.100]  them he this that's a great question why did Trump you can say whatever you
[02:40:56.100 --> 02:40:59.220]  want about Trump he made the establishment shit their pants well he
[02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:04.340]  did because because he first of all they are highly confident that they can just
[02:41:04.340 --> 02:41:07.860]  hand off the presidential nomination to Jeb Bush like a like it was a checked
[02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:11.980]  hat they don't even expect there's gonna be a struggle and now this guy rises out
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:15.700]  of the east they think he's a caricature they laugh him off America
[02:41:15.700 --> 02:41:19.340]  Hillary and the WikiLeaks wanted him to get the nomination right what a joke
[02:41:19.380 --> 02:41:24.820]  they never see him coming and he so totally threatens the status quo where
[02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:28.220]  everybody's in it together now you have a guy who's president suddenly who says
[02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:31.939]  wait a minute where do the American people fit in I'm gonna put them first
[02:41:31.939 --> 02:41:36.260]  not our pockets these are the people the bushes in the Clintons who was it who
[02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:40.500]  said I got a great idea let's make all of our most important pharmaceuticals
[02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:44.580]  and drugs in China what a great idea and they'll pay us millions did anybody stand
[02:41:44.580 --> 02:41:47.540]  up whoever did that should be in a lot of trouble there's no question but did
[02:41:47.540 --> 02:41:50.980]  anybody stop and say is this in the best interest of the United States of
[02:41:50.980 --> 02:41:55.779]  America should we do this no so it was a bipartisan leadership that brought us to
[02:41:55.779 --> 02:41:59.340]  the point where a Donald Trump could emerge and Trump was really challenging
[02:41:59.340 --> 02:42:02.860]  that right there Roger this has been amazing interview we're gonna do a quick
[02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:09.860]  tour here around this shrine to Nixon Reagan conservatism to history at Bob
[02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:13.340]  Dole over there look you can put these guys down and say they weren't perfect
[02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:18.220]  but my god William F Buckley compare them to the left today they run America
[02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:23.740]  but they want to destroy it because they have some weird neurotic envy of it well
[02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:27.460]  what is this see the thing I think it has changed Alex is there was a time
[02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:31.900]  when the people in the country whose wealth had come from the free enterprise
[02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:35.020]  system were conservatives and believed in the free enterprise system what's
[02:42:35.020 --> 02:42:38.180]  ironic here is the wealthiest people in the country the people who made their
[02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:41.820]  money through business through free enterprise now want to crush free
[02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:45.700]  enterprise for everyone else that they want to centralize government they want
[02:42:45.700 --> 02:42:49.860]  government control of business it doesn't even make sense it's almost
[02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:53.660]  antithetical but you got to ask where are the conservative billionaires why
[02:42:53.660 --> 02:42:58.660]  aren't they buying network television stations or cable news stations why
[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:03.939]  aren't they fighting for the the war for digital censorship it's hard to
[02:43:03.939 --> 02:43:09.900]  understand why their financiers are prepared to lose money as long as they
[02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:14.460]  can assert control in other words when Facebook makes decisions to de-platform
[02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:18.500]  and to censor Roger Stone Alex Jones and thousands of other patriots they're
[02:43:18.500 --> 02:43:22.560]  costing themselves money they made money on me year after year after year they
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:25.779]  don't care about money it's all about control they've broken the social
[02:43:25.779 --> 02:43:30.060]  contract they don't care about humanity it's a pure extraction of wealth for
[02:43:30.060 --> 02:43:34.119]  pure power it's anti-human well before we do this tour I want to salute you
[02:43:34.119 --> 02:43:37.580]  for your hard work your perseverance you're not turning on the president and
[02:43:37.580 --> 02:43:40.740]  the American people you become a symbol that they hate info wars that as well
[02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:45.580]  Trump at an even greater level General Flynn it's a very small club that's been
[02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:49.180]  through the fire and survived and we have a responsibility not to give up not
[02:43:49.180 --> 02:43:52.260]  go away but to keep you fighting despite all you've been through you keep
[02:43:52.260 --> 02:43:55.740]  fighting Roger that's why I admire you thank you Alex great to be here here is
[02:43:55.740 --> 02:44:01.140]  to Roger Stone here here Roger Stone did nothing wrong we're gonna have a very
[02:44:01.140 --> 02:44:04.340]  nice dinner with another patriot tonight really with that ladies and gentlemen
[02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:11.660]  this is history happening we're about to talk to Roger Stone we're about to
[02:44:11.660 --> 02:44:17.779]  get a tour of the biggest Richard Nixon Museum on the planet it's here in Florida
[02:44:17.779 --> 02:44:22.939]  let's go in and talk to Roger Stone and ladies and gentlemen he's waiting on us
[02:44:22.939 --> 02:44:28.460]  here is Roger Stone Roger great to be here brother now it's great to see you
[02:44:28.460 --> 02:44:32.140]  so this used to be the info wars Miami studio this is where we did our daily
[02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:36.860]  war room broadcast then every Wednesday thanks to the relief of your fans I
[02:44:36.860 --> 02:44:40.619]  would sit in for you which they seem to like and I worked here every day five
[02:44:40.619 --> 02:44:46.060]  days a week and of course the FBI raided this facility smashed our our desktop
[02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:50.260]  computers destroyed three laptops cut the cords on the microphones destroyed
[02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:54.180]  two digital cameras essentially all the equipment I was using to do my daily
[02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:59.820]  syndicated radio show plus the plus the our daily show and info wars so I
[02:44:59.860 --> 02:45:03.540]  consider everything here pretty much art it's artwork that interested maybe
[02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:07.380]  there's one common theme that's anti-communism Richard Nixon was
[02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:10.939]  sustained throughout his career he was trusted on the right because he was an
[02:45:10.939 --> 02:45:15.980]  anti-communist because he took down Alger as a communist spy Barry Goldwater
[02:45:15.980 --> 02:45:19.860]  really rose in American politics not because he had a charming personality
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:24.420]  but because he was an anti-communist Ronald Reagan emerged from the ashes of
[02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:29.300]  the Goldwater debacle as the new champion of anti-communism that's why
[02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:32.580]  the charge that guys like you and I were working for the Russians is so
[02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:38.180]  insulting we hate communism we're not hot on Russians personally I'm somebody who
[02:45:38.180 --> 02:45:42.540]  had members of my own family mowed down by Russian tanks in Budapest so to say
[02:45:42.540 --> 02:45:46.220]  that we're that we're Russian assets that's insulting well the Democrats are
[02:45:46.220 --> 02:45:49.860]  anti-americans so they project who they are and us this place is an incredible
[02:45:49.860 --> 02:45:54.180]  piece of history let's start right over here Roger because I mean there's so
[02:45:54.180 --> 02:46:00.619]  many places to start I think this is emblematic of our time I think this you
[02:46:00.619 --> 02:46:05.340]  have right here is emblematic this time vote like your whole world depends on it
[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:08.939]  I mean that's where we are we have Biden in power now we see the shutdown of the
[02:46:08.939 --> 02:46:11.980]  country it's incredible well let's remember that this is addressing the
[02:46:11.980 --> 02:46:17.220]  times 1968 is a time of tumult it's a time of upheaval the cities are burning
[02:46:17.220 --> 02:46:22.820]  the campuses are burning there's a giant movement against the government because
[02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:27.900]  of the war in Vietnam there's there's our there are race riots Robert Kennedy
[02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:32.680]  is murdered Martin Luther King is murdered all of these events clear the
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:37.020]  way for Nixon's comeback in other words without the assassination of John
[02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:41.100]  Kennedy which inadvertently breathes life back into the career of Richard
[02:46:41.100 --> 02:46:45.660]  Nixon the subsequent murders of Bobby Kennedy the murder of dr. King the
[02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:50.380]  Vietnam War that creates the perfect storm for Nixon's comeback and of course
[02:46:50.380 --> 02:46:53.420]  the deep state thinks that when Nixon gets to be president he's going to be
[02:46:53.420 --> 02:46:56.180]  another hardliner keep us in Vietnam forever
[02:46:56.180 --> 02:47:01.660]  Nixon's a little smarter he wants to he wants peace so he decides that he's
[02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:06.380]  going to recognize the Chinese so you play them off against the Russians not
[02:47:06.380 --> 02:47:10.180]  because he loves the Chinese but because he can now say look Mao if you don't
[02:47:10.180 --> 02:47:13.060]  want to do the deal I'll go talk to Brezhnev because he wants to do the deal
[02:47:13.060 --> 02:47:17.340]  he saves us hundreds of billions of dollars in defense spending ends the war
[02:47:17.340 --> 02:47:22.580]  in Vietnam 18 year old vote gets rid of the 18 year old draft desegregates the
[02:47:22.580 --> 02:47:25.820]  public schools and that's why the left the entire by the hating just like the
[02:47:25.820 --> 02:47:29.500]  left attack Trump who was ending wars and doing similar thing it is very
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:34.260]  similar so just as they want to they and they effectively erased any history of
[02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:38.260]  Nixon Nixon Watergate he's a criminal nothing else to talk about they want to
[02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:41.619]  do this with Trump Oh Donald Trump impeachment he was impeached twice they
[02:47:41.619 --> 02:47:45.500]  don't talk about the record economy they don't talk about record wage growth
[02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:49.660]  record job growth record low levels of unemployment among all Americans
[02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:53.420]  rebuilding the American military appointing conservatives to the
[02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:57.619]  judiciary they don't talk about any of that they want to erase Donald Trump as
[02:47:57.619 --> 02:48:01.980]  an aberration as a mistake as a temporary mistake they don't understand
[02:48:01.980 --> 02:48:07.300]  that the American first agenda is still has a has a has a majority well that's
[02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:10.779]  the country existing it's the only thing that exists outside global
[02:48:10.779 --> 02:48:14.060]  takeover so walk us through you've got your order start so where should we
[02:48:14.060 --> 02:48:22.460]  start there's so many so in 1960 Richard Nixon lost the presidency by a
[02:48:22.460 --> 02:48:27.380]  hair to John Kennedy John Kennedy was not today's Democrat he was an
[02:48:27.380 --> 02:48:32.900]  anti-communist he was he was a favor favored a size sound either gold or
[02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:36.180]  silver backed dollar he was very skeptical about the Central Intelligence
[02:48:36.180 --> 02:48:40.700]  Agency in the deep state of his day he gave his life for as you can see in my
[02:48:40.740 --> 02:48:47.500]  book the man who killed Kennedy the case against LBJ but the the 1960 close loss
[02:48:47.500 --> 02:48:51.500]  caused conservatives in the Republican Party to say that Nixon lost because he
[02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:56.180]  had pulled his punches because he hadn't attacked Jack Kennedy as standing for
[02:48:56.180 --> 02:49:01.020]  the dime-store socialism of the real left wing of the Democratic Party this
[02:49:01.020 --> 02:49:05.820]  gives rise to the candidacy of Barry Goldwater now Barry Goldwater was a very
[02:49:05.820 --> 02:49:11.260]  irascible guy he liked drinking he was kind of crabby and cranky he liked show
[02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:15.980]  girls too he was very close to the Indians he was a photographer who's a
[02:49:15.980 --> 02:49:21.060]  pilot he was a ham radio operation what he was not was a yes ma'am and he didn't
[02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:23.980]  want to be president he didn't want to lead a movement but he had no choice
[02:49:23.980 --> 02:49:28.180]  because he was the new face of conservatism he lost an ignominious
[02:49:28.180 --> 02:49:32.540]  defeat to Lyndon Johnson but he lays the groundwork for the modern
[02:49:32.540 --> 02:49:36.420]  Conservative Party without Barry Goldwater there have been no Ronald
[02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:41.500]  Reagan so out of the Goldwater defeat rises a new political star when Goldwater's
[02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:45.860]  campaign is essentially out of money and out of energy actor Ronald Reagan goes
[02:49:45.860 --> 02:49:50.619]  on national television to give a speech called a time for choosing hundreds of
[02:49:50.619 --> 02:49:53.660]  thousands of dollars pour into Goldwater's headquarters for the close
[02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:59.340]  of the campaign and a new conservative star is born recognize that in 1964
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:04.100]  Barry Goldwater runs an unabashed conservative and lost and loses all but
[02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:10.140]  a handful of southern states but then in 1966 Ronald Reagan is elected governor
[02:50:10.140 --> 02:50:14.100]  as an unabashed conservative of the largest state in the country California
[02:50:14.100 --> 02:50:18.820]  this is the beginning of the modern political conservative movement when
[02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:23.340]  Richard Nixon was forced to resign the presidency because of the onslaught of
[02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:27.779]  the fake news media of its time and by the way the crimes he's accused of look
[02:50:27.779 --> 02:50:31.660]  like small potatoes compared to the crimes committed by the Biden
[02:50:31.660 --> 02:50:36.740]  administration not to mention the Clintons or the Obamas but in 1976
[02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:43.260]  Nixon leaves Gerald Ford a very weak contender as a sitting vice president
[02:50:43.260 --> 02:50:49.100]  who accedes to the presidency upon the the resignation of Richard Nixon when
[02:50:49.100 --> 02:50:52.580]  Gerald Ford becomes president it's clear that the left-wing and the
[02:50:52.580 --> 02:50:57.060]  establishment Republican parties control again and that the Goldwater movement of
[02:50:57.060 --> 02:51:02.340]  both Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan has been sidelined but then Governor
[02:51:02.340 --> 02:51:07.460]  Ronald Reagan decides to challenge Gerald Ford for the nomination running
[02:51:07.460 --> 02:51:12.300]  an extraordinary shoestring campaign he comes within inches of dethroning a
[02:51:12.300 --> 02:51:17.060]  sitting Republican president who was elected by no one and he marks himself
[02:51:17.060 --> 02:51:21.540]  strangely enough as the contender for four years later Gerald Ford of course
[02:51:21.540 --> 02:51:27.020]  loses to Jimmy Carter setting the stage for a comeback by Ronald Reagan
[02:51:27.020 --> 02:51:33.260]  1980 Ronald Reagan's time has come and he runs an audacious campaign against
[02:51:33.260 --> 02:51:37.580]  Jimmy Carter an incumbent the Carter people actually according to Hamilton
[02:51:37.580 --> 02:51:41.660]  Jordan's book they want to run against Reagan they think he's a simpleton they
[02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:45.460]  think it'd be easy to beat him that's what Pat Brown thought in California
[02:51:45.460 --> 02:51:49.300]  Reagan who is a master craftsman who understands that politics is
[02:51:49.300 --> 02:51:53.220]  entertainment and who puts a warm face on conservatism something Goldwater
[02:51:53.220 --> 02:51:57.740]  could never do beats Jimmy Carter to become the first outsider president of
[02:51:57.740 --> 02:52:02.460]  my lifetime and perhaps among our greatest presidents let's be very clear
[02:52:02.460 --> 02:52:09.300]  this leads indirectly to the election of perhaps the greatest president since
[02:52:09.300 --> 02:52:13.580]  Abraham Lincoln Donald Trump it's the same political movement it's the same
[02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:16.939]  I don't think this is indirect I mean Trump modeled it after Reagan
[02:52:16.939 --> 02:52:22.220]  there's no question but he's the heir he is the natural inheritor of the
[02:52:22.220 --> 02:52:26.220]  conservative Republican mantle the populist conservative mantle suppressed
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:30.340]  by the Bush's in the 80s they're shocked when he breaks out of the pack to take
[02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:33.900]  the nomination they're shocked when he takes the wood to Hillary Clinton she
[02:52:33.900 --> 02:52:38.460]  becomes and he becomes president this is a man the establishment hates why they
[02:52:38.460 --> 02:52:43.380]  can't control him they can't bully him they can't threaten him he loves America
[02:52:43.380 --> 02:52:47.420]  and he answers only to the American people Roger I've seen you on air talk
[02:52:47.420 --> 02:52:50.939]  about that historic wall that's always your favorite wall but talk about this
[02:52:50.939 --> 02:52:54.340]  wall and that wall and those walls in the bathroom that's reserved to
[02:52:54.340 --> 02:52:57.580]  Democrats I mean every one of these is a piece of history a lot of these are
[02:52:57.580 --> 02:53:03.180]  originals only here well as you know in 1952 Vice President Richard Nixon is
[02:53:03.180 --> 02:53:07.980]  invited to Moscow to an exhibit where they're comparing society under the
[02:53:07.980 --> 02:53:13.060]  Soviet regime with society in America and they have a model of the US modern
[02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:18.820]  kitchen and Khrushchev and Nixon stroll through this talking to each other this
[02:53:18.820 --> 02:53:23.740]  is where Khrushchev says to his face we will bury you and Nixon says no you
[02:53:23.740 --> 02:53:27.500]  think we're gonna live under communism let me give you a hint mr. chairman your
[02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:32.740]  children will live under freedom and of course it makes Nixon a history hero
[02:53:32.740 --> 02:53:37.060]  back home because he has confronted the communists to their face and declared
[02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:42.980]  himself on the side of history to be for American ideals this catapults
[02:53:42.980 --> 02:53:49.619]  Nixon to the 1960 nomination where unfortunately he decides to compromise
[02:53:49.619 --> 02:53:53.540]  with the Rockefeller wing of the party and he falls just short laying the
[02:53:53.540 --> 02:53:57.860]  groundwork for Barry Goldwater laying the groundwork for Ronald Reagan laying
[02:53:57.860 --> 02:54:03.500]  the groundwork for Donald Trump now this is particularly rare Nixon's career of
[02:54:03.500 --> 02:54:08.380]  course takes a detour he loses the presidency in 1960 but he still aspires
[02:54:08.380 --> 02:54:14.619]  to be president no man who has lost by a hair would not feel that way so he
[02:54:14.619 --> 02:54:19.540]  launches a campaign to be governor of California job he doesn't want in a
[02:54:19.540 --> 02:54:23.180]  state where he doesn't live not really and where he has no interest in state
[02:54:23.180 --> 02:54:27.340]  issues but he's a favorite and Dwight Eisenhower and Tom Dewey the former
[02:54:27.340 --> 02:54:32.540]  governor in New York nominee of the Republican Party 1944-1948 prevail on
[02:54:32.540 --> 02:54:39.900]  Nixon to run Nixon loses in an upset this lays the groundwork for the
[02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:44.300]  reelection of Lyndon Johnson unimpeded see Nixon knew he couldn't beat Johnson
[02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:50.100]  after the Kennedy assassination nobody could and he waits his turn for 1968 the
[02:54:50.100 --> 02:54:55.420]  Nixon for governor campaign was an abysmal failure run by the same people
[02:54:55.420 --> 02:55:01.340]  who ran his incredible comeback in 1968 well there's a lot of memorabilia here
[02:55:01.340 --> 02:55:05.500]  and most of it is not valuable to anybody other than me but there are some
[02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:11.540]  valuable and I think really symbolic pieces let me show you for example my
[02:55:11.540 --> 02:55:17.580]  very famous Richard M Nixon bong now the irony of this is that one of Nixon's
[02:55:17.580 --> 02:55:21.980]  greatest failures was launching the war on drugs the war on drugs of course was
[02:55:21.980 --> 02:55:26.500]  not what it morphed into under Bill Clinton and Joe Biden but even then it
[02:55:26.500 --> 02:55:34.180]  was a it was an inequitable racially biased system in which people who really
[02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:38.180]  belonged in drug treatment were incarcerated despite the fact that they
[02:55:38.180 --> 02:55:43.180]  are not violent criminals this celebrates the fact that on the American
[02:55:43.180 --> 02:55:48.820]  left that Nixon the candidate who gave us the war on drugs perhaps his greatest
[02:55:48.820 --> 02:55:54.939]  single mistake is being mocked by the smoking of marijuana in a bong in the
[02:55:54.939 --> 02:55:59.860]  shape of his head there were head shops in those days that that sold psychedelic
[02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:05.140]  posters and other ephemera that made fun of our political leaders for example
[02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:11.380]  your Richard Nixon rolling papers perfect example so a lot of these items
[02:56:11.380 --> 02:56:16.180]  were created to mock Nixon but they're still they're historical curios they're
[02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:21.939]  still they're like markers and I have collected them for example the candle
[02:56:21.939 --> 02:56:28.060]  and Richard Nixon's head the shape of his head or the watch which he and Pat
[02:56:28.060 --> 02:56:33.939]  stare back at you with a great smile he was the most durable politician of the
[02:56:33.939 --> 02:56:39.260]  century he was on the ticket more times than any living American between his two
[02:56:39.260 --> 02:56:43.460]  races for vice president and his three races for president of the United States
[02:56:43.460 --> 02:56:47.340]  yet he will not be remembered the way Ronald Reagan was he will certainly not
[02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:51.900]  be remembered in the way Donald Trump was because the media of his time buried
[02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:54.980]  his great accomplishments the way they seek to bury the great accomplishments
[02:56:54.980 --> 02:56:59.500]  of Donald Trump even today tell me what this is well that's something that was
[02:56:59.500 --> 02:57:03.380]  given to every member of the Nixon staff who participated in his triumphant
[02:57:03.380 --> 02:57:09.420]  campaign tour in 1968 here's every city every city in which he appeared here you
[02:57:09.420 --> 02:57:13.700]  have flight certificates so when I was on board Air Force One with President
[02:57:13.700 --> 02:57:18.500]  Ronald Reagan during the 1984 campaign that certificate memorializes that it's
[02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:21.779]  one of the things that I'm very honored to have the same thing true of the
[02:57:21.779 --> 02:57:27.140]  president's whistle-stop tour through Ohio that's where the train certificate
[02:57:27.140 --> 02:57:33.100]  is from John Sears the strategist for Nixon 76 campaign really the man who
[02:57:33.100 --> 02:57:37.500]  won in the 1980 nomination before being ignominiously fired before the New
[02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:42.540]  Hampshire primary a mentor of mine a very very smart guy passed away about a
[02:57:42.700 --> 02:57:49.140]  year ago so these are mostly personal things Governor Jim Rhodes the boss of
[02:57:49.140 --> 02:57:53.660]  the Ohio Republican Party head-to-head with the tafts constantly in a struggle
[02:57:53.660 --> 02:57:57.460]  for control turned out to be one of Ronald Reagan's greatest and most
[02:57:57.460 --> 02:58:02.820]  effective supporters we had a strong bond John Davis Lodge my political
[02:58:02.820 --> 02:58:07.740]  mentor former governor of Connecticut former ambassador to Spain in Argentina
[02:58:07.740 --> 02:58:12.020]  and then later under Ronald Reagan Switzerland the brother of Henry Cabot
[02:58:12.020 --> 02:58:16.860]  Lodge notorious liberal Republican but John Davis Lodge was a true American
[02:58:16.860 --> 02:58:20.619]  patriot Roger you're known in your life as being associated with a lot of lovely

[02:59:24.060 --> 02:59:28.060]  were optimistic about beating Hillary Clinton we were taking the fight to her
[02:59:28.060 --> 02:59:33.220]  I said over and over again lock her up many people on the internet thought that
[02:59:33.220 --> 02:59:38.740]  was very funny when I was unfairly and I think wrongfully convicted on
[02:59:38.740 --> 02:59:43.220]  fabricated charges but then when I was pardoned I pulled those back up and I
[02:59:43.220 --> 02:59:46.939]  said well this didn't age too well did it no Hillary Clinton was the one who
[02:59:46.939 --> 02:59:51.540]  should be locked up this was a great moment in American history and yes Alex
[02:59:51.540 --> 02:59:54.900]  I think we both need to go on a diet
