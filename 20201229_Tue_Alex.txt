[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Music
[00:20.000 --> 00:28.000]  Decades ago, George Carlin, a true mind, a true visionary,
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  laid out where we are today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  The witch hunt of germs and germ phobia
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.000]  flies in the face of all real knowledge about germs
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  that if you live in a bubble, then any basic germ will kill you.
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  And if you don't have the right nutrients
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  and have a good immune system, any germ will kill you.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  If you have a good immune system
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  and you've been exposed to a lot of things in your life naturally,
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  there's actually studies that swimming in swamps, swimming in ponds,
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  swimming in systems that are contaminated
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  actually make you stronger.
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.000]  Well, where I grew up in Dallas wasn't as polluted
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  as where George Carlin grew up,
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  but it was pretty close and I just never got sick.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  I get sick now every four or five years.
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  In January, I flew with my wife and children
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  down to Grand Cayman on a commercial flight
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  and I got a chest cold for the first time in five years
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  and had a fever for two days and I'm pretty sure it was COVID.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  It's been here we now know for two years.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  That's in the studies, by the way.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  But here's what George Carlin had to say about it.
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.000]  He knocked it out of the park.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  Because that's what Americans do now.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  in exchange for the feeling, the illusion of security.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  and hygiene and germs.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  There's another thing, germs.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  Where did this sudden fear of germs come from in this country?
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  Have you noticed this?
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  The media constantly running stories about all the latest infections,
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  salmonella, E. coli, hand to virus, bird flu,
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  and Americans are, they panic easily,
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  so now everybody's running around scrubbing this and spraying that
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  and overcooking their food and repeatedly washing their hands,
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  trying to avoid all contact with germs.
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  It's ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  Fear it, germs, why these f***ing f***ies?
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  Hey, where's your sense of adventure?
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  Take a f***ing chance, will ya?
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  Besides, what do you think you have an immune system for?
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  It's for killing germs.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  But it needs practice.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  It needs germs to practice on you.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  So, so listen.
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  So listen.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  If you kill all the germs around you
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  and live a completely sterile life,
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  then when germs do come along, you're not going to be prepared.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  And never mind ordinary germs,
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  what are you going to do when some super virus comes along
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  that turns your vital organs into liquid s***?
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.000]  I'll tell you what you're going to do.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  You're going to get sick, you're going to die,
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  and you're going to deserve it because you're f***ing weak
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  and you got a f***ing weak immune system.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  Now, hey, can I tell ya?
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  Hey, let me tell you a true story about immunization, okay?
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  When I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s,
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.000]  we swam in the Hudson River,
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  and it was filled with raw sewage, okay?
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  We swam in raw sewage, you know, to cool off.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  And at that time, the big fear was polio.
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  Thousands of kids died from polio every year.
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  But you know something?
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  In my neighborhood, no one ever got polio.
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  No one ever.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  You know why?
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  Because we swam in raw sewage.
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  It strengthened our immune systems.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  But polio never had a prayer.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  We were tempered in raw s***.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  George Carlin warned us about the COVID panic years ago.
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  My father's mother kept him so clean that he was sickly.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  He was about a year old, and his black nanny said,
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  he needs Hindu tea and told my grandmother,
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  I'm going to feed him boiled chicken manure.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  She said, no, you won't.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  But she snuck and gave him Hindu tea,
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  which had all the natural immunities.
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.000]  And he never really got sick again.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  So that's why they're now doing transfusions
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  of people's fecal matter that have the right bacteria
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  into other people that don't, who've taken too many antibiotics.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  It's crazy, folks, but it's all real.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  And the system knows this.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  They're removing our immune system.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  And the studies already show these mRNA vaccines
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  either turn off your immune system
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  and make you have an allergic response to any cold virus,
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  or it turns it way up.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  And now you see what Wolfgang Wodarg and the EU experts
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  warned about is now happening everywhere.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  They're now covering up deaths, by the way, from the vaccine.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  That's all coming up in 60 seconds.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  So, folks, tune in right now.
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  This message is not for our regular listeners
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000]  who are informed and understand about the value
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  of essential vitamins and minerals,
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  meaning if you don't have them, you die long term.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  It's for new listeners.
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  The power structure works around the clock
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  to kind of debilitate you and try to make you sickly.
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  Please research, because this is life and death,
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  vitamins that are essential
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  and minerals that are essential.
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  Just type that into a search engine.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  You will see the top universities, CDC,
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.000]  all of them telling you this,
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  but you won't see this on the nightly news
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  because they don't want you at the big pharma companies
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  to understand how to protect yourself
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  to a great extent from what's going on in the world
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  on a routine basis.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  We now have Back in Stock, Winner's Son,
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K

[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  sold out for months.
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  It is essential, it is vital, and it is 50% off,

[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  and your family.

[05:55.000 --> 06:16.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  We are now 22 days out from the inauguration
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.000]  of either Joe Biden, the Communist Chinese agent,
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  or the rightful winner in the biggest landslide
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  and political realignment in modern U.S. history,
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  Donald John Trump.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  You can debate whether you should have done this
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  pardon or should have done this emergency bill.
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  That's all deck chairs in the Titanic.
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.000]  What matters is we reelected him,
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  and the Globals are coming in trying to steal
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  this election from us.
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  Now, I know some incredible information
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  that I am not at liberty to tell you,
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  but I am at liberty to just give you a hint,
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  which I don't think is too hard.
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000]  As Trump said, January 6th will be wild in D.C.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  Well, it will be wild.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  And I can tell you the twilight zone nature of all of this
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  went up to a whole new level yesterday,
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  and I'll leave it at that.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  Trump knew about the first rally in D.C.
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  He didn't know about the second one, got real upset.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  Said I would have been there if he had known
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  that I flew over for like an hour in his helicopter.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  And, well, let's just say you're going to want to go to D.C.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  on the 6th.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  It will show the globalists we know Trump early won.
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  And it will begin the process one way or another
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  of removing the globalist puppet, Joe Biden.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  I mean by impeachment or keeping him from getting in
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  on the 20th.
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.000]  The last thing I want is for Joe Biden to have a hair
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  on his degenerate head, his evil chai-kong had hurt,
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  because that will turn him into a martyr.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  And I go back to this.
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  The media still, thousands of articles.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  Arrest Jones, he said, killed Joe Biden.
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.000]  Oh, where's the secret service?
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  They didn't come talk to me.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  Because they watched the whole speech.
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  And the media edited it.
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  I said, I don't know if he's going to get it in 30-something
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  days back at the time.
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  Or I don't know if he's going to get impeached,
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  but we're going to remove him one way or another.
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  Well, they just took the club and he's saying,
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.000]  we're moving one way or another.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  And said, that's a death threat.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  Compared to them saying they're going to kill Trump everywhere.
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  The former head of the CIA assassination squad said,
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  the government's going to kill this guy.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  That's like if a convicted child molester says,
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  I'm going to come rape your kid.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  You get in trouble because you're a convicted child molester.
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  When you're the former guy that ran the CIA death squads,
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  he says, the guys at Foggy Bottom are going to kill Trump.
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  That's a very serious threat.
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  And I consulted with the Secret Service and demanded that they do
[08:46.000 --> 08:47.000]  something about him.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  And the little word is, he got to visit.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  So that's who you go after, people that actually have a history
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  of this type of behavior.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  The CIA has a history of killing US presidents and I'm sick
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  and tired of it.
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  OK, let me just kind of calmly explain this.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  I got prepared for yesterday's show for several days.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  And then I got so upset after looking at all the news and
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  evidence and over preparing that I was in such a nasty move when
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  I started the show yesterday that I just didn't cover it.
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  And let me explain why.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  Most of this info I've already looked at five or six times.
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  Then I add new info to it.
[09:26.000 --> 09:27.000]  And it's so ridiculous.
[09:27.000 --> 09:28.000]  It's so fraudulent.
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  It's so transparent.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  It's like watching someone stick their arm in a garbage disposal
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  and say, I heard on TV if I flip the switch,
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  it's going to massage my fingers.
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.000]  You go, let me show you what it does.
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  And you stick a carrot in it and it cuts it up.
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  You go, don't stick your hand in that.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  They go, I'm doing it.
[09:48.000 --> 09:49.000]  You're a liar.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  Stick their hand on and cut their fingers off.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  I mean, use whatever analogy you want.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  But like, don't jump off that cliff.
[09:58.000 --> 09:59.000]  You'll die.
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  And it's a thousand foot cliff.
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  This is open and shut.
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  We have all the proof.
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  And we know the further we go down this rat hole,
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  the further we let the system drag us,
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  the worse it's going to get.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  And they've committed this mass crime against humanity
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  with the lockdown and the COVID hoax and all of it
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  because they've not gotten in trouble for their past activities
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  and now they are extremely, extremely arrogant.
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  And they've got all these minions that feel like
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  they're doing a good job that are going along with all this,
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  not knowing they're aiding in their own destruction.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  So let me just tell you what we've got coming up today.
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.000]  The news I had yesterday that then dovetails
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  and augments with the news I've got today.
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.000]  And then I've got a call to action for everybody
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  that is not even civil disobedience.
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  It's just citizen journalism.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  If you want to stop these new world order people
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  dead in their tracks.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  But let me show you just the COVID stacks.
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  One is from yesterday, three are from today.
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  So I have four stacks right here, four COVID stacks.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  Now look at this stat.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  WHO, bigger pandemic than COVID is coming.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  You can talk an hour about that, how it's all pre-programmed.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  We can show you how it's pre-programmed.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.000]  We can even show you documents where they admit this is a simulation
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  for the real one that they're about to launch.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  And then I have Bill Gates admitting it.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  And you go, why does he admit it?
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  Why in every cartoon does a supervillain brag?
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  That's criminology. They brag.
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  The real pleasure is throwing it in your face.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  In fact, I'm told the globalists thought I was funny
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  until Trump got elected.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  They thought, oh, we love Jones.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  He tells them what we're doing to them.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  My show was a big entertainment for them.
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  It's not so entertaining now.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  But that's how these people operate.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  So let's continue.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  This is just one stack.
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  Whistleblower, globalists planning more lockdowns
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  to usher in universal basic income.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  This is a whistleblower in government.
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  We don't need a whistleblower.
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.000]  We have the damn public documents.
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  Klaus Schwab and Justin Trudeau and all of them admit it.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  UK researchers, China's COVID response
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  will make them world's biggest economy in 2028.
[12:20.000 --> 12:21.000]  That's the whole spin.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  The headline is China responded right.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  They're totally open. We'll never be open.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  So they're going to run the world in just a few years.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  That's the whole setup.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  Print me some of those headlines.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  I meant to cover it this weekend when I came in and did reports.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  So just type in China to replace
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  US's world's biggest economy, 2028,
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  like Bloomberg Reuters, all that.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  I'm showing you what some of the stacks are.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  Scientists grab a determined mutant strain
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  of coronavirus will deepen pandemic.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  I have scanned over or read all of these,
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  and they all tie together. This is just one stack.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  Now, this admits world government.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  This admits this was just a lockdown drill.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  The real depopulation weapons are coming.
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  By submitting, you guarantee they roll out COVID 2.0.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  And I don't just have their own documents.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  I have Bill Gates saying it, and I'll play that for you.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  That's pretty important, huh?
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  Pretty upsetting, too.
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  Let's move on to the other stack.
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  LA County hospitals reached the breaking point.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  Turnaway ambulances.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  So I went to the National Hospital Association
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  in accordance with the CDC's own maps
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  and gave up to the date COVID tracking numbers
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  for the hospitals.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  And it's a total lie, and it's a total fraud.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  What they do is they'll designate five beds
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  in a hospital for COVID.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  And then when those beds go over,
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  they go, oh, my God, we're at 100% capacity
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  manipulating the statistics
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  when many of the hospitals are still completely empty.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  Some, like the big emergency hospitals
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  are already overwhelmed, are turning people away.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  They do routinely.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  I was in an LA event once, and one of our crew members
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  had violent food poisoning.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  And we took them to the emergency room,
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  and they turned him away,
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  even though we were having to carry him.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  And he was vomiting everywhere.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  Now, that was 10, 12 years ago.
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  I was 14 years ago.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  So again, they're like, oh, we're turning people away.
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  Well, that's like saying one restaurant is full,
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  but there's 10 more next door that aren't.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  That's how they statistically manipulated.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  But I'm just going to tell you that.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  We're going to show you where you can go directly
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  into the CDC's own numbers
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  and see what every hospital in your town or city has,
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  because the COVID cases are all reported,
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  because they're all incentivized to call it COVID to get money.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  And most of these people don't even need to be in the hospital.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  But Travis County is at, as of last night,
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  9% COVID capacity.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  There are 77 people
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  in hospitals in Austin, in Travis County,
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  that supposedly have COVID.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  We're talking millions of people,
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  77 in the hospital,
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  and they're having a death maybe once a week.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  I mean, you can go look at the numbers for yourself.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  I'll show you where you can go look at it.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  And even see it in an even NPR,
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  they link to it going, oh my gosh, epidemic,
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  everything's shut down, hospitals overwhelmed.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  Look at the statistics here.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  It's a confidence game.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  They know no one goes and actually looks at the statistics.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  Maybe one out of a thousand.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  We did.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  It's like saying, there's a giant monster in that building,
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  but don't go in there.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  You go in there, there's nothing there.
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  So we've all got to go out of these hospitals
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  and just show this.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  I mean, I already know how many are there.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  I'll go to these hospitals that have empty parking lots.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  You can look at the CDC's own number
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  and go there, five patients in that hospital with COVID.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  Meanwhile, they're on the news in like gas masks and spaces.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  We're all dying.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  There's dead everywhere.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  There's dead bodies everywhere inside.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  You can look at the hospital and see no one's died
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  a month in there from COVID.
[15:55.000 --> 16:24.000]  Total fraud.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  그러니까.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  The red dot video.
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  The resistance Scott video.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.000]  and can defeat them.
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.000]  So the new URL that links right to Band-Aid video
[16:41.000 --> 16:41.000]  and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.000]  is at the resistance.video Share the link
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  the resistance.video The resistance.video
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  and all the robust information is at the resistance.video
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.640]  The resistance dot video, the resistance dot video.
[16:56.640 --> 17:00.320]  The year 2021 is almost here.
[17:00.320 --> 17:03.960]  And so we're launching our new year's specials right now.
[17:03.960 --> 17:05.480]  We've got two different big sales.
[17:05.480 --> 17:08.840]  We've got Supermobile Vitality Turbo Force and Ultra 12,
[17:08.840 --> 17:12.680]  part of the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off.
[17:12.680 --> 17:15.080]  And we've got Bodies, Vaso Beats and Knockout,
[17:15.080 --> 17:17.640]  part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack
[17:17.640 --> 17:18.800]  at 40% off.
[17:18.800 --> 17:21.320]  But if you get both of these packs together,
[17:21.320 --> 17:24.080]  they are 60% off with free shipping
[17:24.080 --> 17:27.200]  and double Patriot points, the best deal ever.

[17:40.560 --> 17:42.760]  at a time that it's more critical than ever.
[17:42.760 --> 17:45.800]  Again, the year 2021 is here
[17:45.800 --> 17:47.600]  and I am committed to you to fight
[17:47.600 --> 17:49.320]  against the globalist harder than ever.
[17:49.320 --> 17:52.200]  So thank you so much for keeping Info Wars in the fight.
[17:52.200 --> 17:54.320]  Light your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[17:59.120 --> 18:02.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:07.960 --> 18:12.840]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
[18:12.840 --> 18:17.600]  Lord, I can't change.
[18:17.600 --> 18:22.600]  Don't you fly, I'm free, oh, yeah.
[18:33.360 --> 18:35.200]  All right, if you just joined us, ladies and gentlemen,
[18:35.200 --> 18:36.960]  the next segment, I'm gonna show you
[18:36.960 --> 18:38.800]  from the CDC's own website.
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.520]  I'm gonna show you from NPR,
[18:41.520 --> 18:43.080]  I'm gonna show you from CNN,
[18:43.080 --> 18:46.960]  links they send to the official data of the hospitals
[18:46.960 --> 18:49.200]  in every county and every city in America.
[18:49.200 --> 18:51.640]  And I'm gonna show you local news
[18:51.640 --> 18:54.640]  saying they're gonna declare martial law basically
[18:54.640 --> 18:56.480]  and have nighttime curfews
[18:56.480 --> 18:58.800]  and close all small businesses again.
[19:00.200 --> 19:02.720]  Notice it never ends, the problem never ends
[19:02.720 --> 19:05.080]  because the hospitals are all full of COVID
[19:05.080 --> 19:08.280]  and there's mass infection, but not mass death
[19:08.280 --> 19:09.880]  because they're upping the amount of tests
[19:09.880 --> 19:11.440]  that are being done.
[19:11.440 --> 19:13.240]  And basically almost everybody that gets tested,
[19:13.240 --> 19:16.680]  they say have it because the inventor of the PCR test said,
[19:16.680 --> 19:18.400]  you can set it for whatever you want
[19:18.400 --> 19:20.680]  and even federal and international courts have said,
[19:20.680 --> 19:22.720]  it is a fraud and not admissible
[19:22.720 --> 19:26.360]  and the New York Times says 96% are false positive.
[19:28.080 --> 19:30.800]  Unbelievable, but now this little computer,
[19:30.800 --> 19:34.880]  this little black box can say you can't get on an airplane,
[19:34.880 --> 19:36.480]  can't have a job, can't live your life
[19:36.480 --> 19:38.040]  and then you gotta take a vaccine
[19:38.040 --> 19:39.720]  with the head of the WHO.
[19:39.720 --> 19:42.240]  Now, it's doesn't even protect you from COVID,
[19:42.240 --> 19:45.640]  it doesn't even protect you from sharing it
[19:45.640 --> 19:47.320]  and spreading it.
[19:47.320 --> 19:51.080]  This is a witch hunt based on hysteria,
[19:51.080 --> 19:52.440]  based on chicken little behavior.
[19:52.440 --> 19:56.220]  It's a chicken little meets the Salem witch trials.
[19:57.280 --> 19:58.400]  It's coming up next segment.
[19:58.400 --> 20:02.080]  And I could sit here and do drum beats,
[20:02.080 --> 20:03.960]  I could sit here and pull my hair out.
[20:03.960 --> 20:07.840]  I mean, I could sit here, this is the total proof
[20:07.840 --> 20:11.000]  that once you wear a mask for six, eight, nine, 10 months,
[20:11.000 --> 20:12.320]  once you've virtue signal,
[20:12.320 --> 20:14.840]  once you decide you're a hero,
[20:14.840 --> 20:17.920]  you go along with and you go along with the contact tracing
[20:17.920 --> 20:20.840]  and the tracker apps and the medical IDs
[20:20.840 --> 20:22.960]  and the force inoculations that the corporations
[20:22.960 --> 20:25.680]  are all gonna force us through corporate governance to do.
[20:25.680 --> 20:28.440]  That's what world government is, is corporate governance.
[20:30.600 --> 20:33.120]  But the good news is even Marco Rubio
[20:33.120 --> 20:34.440]  has come out against all this,
[20:34.440 --> 20:36.800]  saying it's a power grab and a lie
[20:36.800 --> 20:38.620]  and elites taking over.
[20:38.620 --> 20:40.420]  Marco Rubio sticks his finger in the air
[20:40.420 --> 20:41.600]  and goes the way it blows.
[20:41.600 --> 20:46.120]  When Rubio says no to this, it means his constituents
[20:46.120 --> 20:50.120]  are blowing his doors down saying you stop it now,
[20:50.120 --> 20:51.840]  we are essential.
[20:51.840 --> 20:56.160]  Our bodegas and our businesses and our hotels
[20:56.160 --> 20:58.720]  and our factories are essential, buddy boy.
[21:01.480 --> 21:02.320]  And you get up there
[21:02.320 --> 21:04.360]  and you get this gorilla off our back now.
[21:06.200 --> 21:08.800]  So elites are tricking Americans,
[21:08.800 --> 21:11.740]  don't take the vaccine, he says, wow.
[21:12.760 --> 21:15.360]  See, the globalist already had this plan on the shelf.
[21:16.320 --> 21:17.600]  It's a very risky plan.
[21:17.600 --> 21:19.480]  They launched it early.
[21:19.480 --> 21:21.000]  It has a huge effect up front,
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.620]  but the tail end of it has got quite the blowback.
[21:25.760 --> 21:29.000]  The whole thing has to operate on censorship.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.320]  Well, how do you censor millions of doctors and scientists
[21:31.320 --> 21:33.360]  and the former chief scientist at Pfizer
[21:33.360 --> 21:35.880]  saying do not take the shot, it can kill you?
[21:35.880 --> 21:40.020]  How do they cover up all the deaths and all the narcolepsy
[21:40.020 --> 21:42.980]  and all the epilepsy and all the guillonne berets
[21:44.260 --> 21:45.540]  and all the bells palsy?
[21:47.820 --> 21:50.780]  How do you sit there when your hamburger place is closed
[21:50.780 --> 21:54.060]  that McDonald's is open in Los Angeles, across the street?
[21:54.060 --> 21:55.940]  They're essential, you're not.
[21:55.940 --> 21:58.500]  This is beyond transparent.
[21:58.500 --> 22:01.300]  That's why yesterday I was so mad looking at all this
[22:01.300 --> 22:03.340]  that I basically couldn't even do the show.
[22:03.340 --> 22:06.580]  And the cops come over and go, we don't care.
[22:06.580 --> 22:09.540]  Law says your place is closed, McDonald's is open.
[22:09.540 --> 22:11.820]  He says, screw you, parks his car behind their car
[22:11.820 --> 22:13.180]  and says, you're not essential.
[22:13.180 --> 22:14.580]  Don't you people get it?
[22:16.300 --> 22:19.620]  You're working for the UN in a damn takeover.
[22:19.620 --> 22:20.460]  Stop it.
[22:23.020 --> 22:24.780]  It's the UN funded Black Lives Matter
[22:24.780 --> 22:26.660]  and all this to take over the cities
[22:26.660 --> 22:28.060]  with a strong cities initiative
[22:28.060 --> 22:33.060]  that they've hired college educated idiots to be police now.
[22:33.500 --> 22:35.300]  They're nothing but bureaucrats.
[22:36.780 --> 22:39.300]  They were brought up in these colleges and high schools
[22:39.300 --> 22:42.420]  where they're now banning the word brown bag.
[22:42.420 --> 22:44.860]  Remember like six years ago, Seattle banned
[22:44.860 --> 22:46.340]  the term brown bag in the city
[22:46.340 --> 22:48.100]  and they said, don't even bring brown bags.
[22:48.100 --> 22:50.780]  Has nothing to do with brown people.
[22:50.780 --> 22:53.500]  Just a classic brown bag means like when mom packed you lunch
[22:53.500 --> 22:54.740]  going with your brown bag.
[22:56.060 --> 22:57.260]  Well now major universities
[22:57.260 --> 23:00.140]  are banning the word brown bag and picnic.
[23:00.140 --> 23:02.020]  Picnic has nothing to do with racism or anything
[23:02.020 --> 23:04.220]  but it's about we control the language
[23:04.220 --> 23:06.180]  no matter how ridiculous we take control.
[23:06.180 --> 23:07.500]  All right, I'm gonna cover it next segment
[23:07.500 --> 23:09.060]  and all the election news.
[23:09.060 --> 23:12.620]  We've got Kyle Rittenhouse's mother.
[23:14.940 --> 23:18.100]  She did her first interview yesterday with Owen Schreuer.
[23:18.100 --> 23:19.100]  I was like up here working.
[23:19.100 --> 23:21.380]  I was like, wow, she's got a lot to say.
[23:22.340 --> 23:23.700]  I haven't seen her on TV and they're like, no,
[23:23.700 --> 23:24.820]  this is I think her first interview.
[23:24.820 --> 23:27.820]  So she'll be joining us with her lawyer
[23:27.820 --> 23:30.020]  about the incredible persecution of the Rittenhouse's.
[23:30.020 --> 23:33.700]  That's a beta test for the rest of us in the third hour.
[23:33.700 --> 23:36.900]  And popping in is Ivan Raiklin,
[23:36.900 --> 23:39.380]  who's working very closely with General Flynn and others.
[23:39.380 --> 23:40.900]  He says Trump should seize control
[23:40.900 --> 23:43.180]  of the EAS emergency system.
[23:43.180 --> 23:45.140]  Now they're gonna call that martial law
[23:45.140 --> 23:49.020]  except I've been harping on this since Trump won.
[23:49.020 --> 23:52.060]  Obama retained control of the EAS system.
[23:52.060 --> 23:54.900]  They never explained it to Trump.
[23:56.300 --> 23:58.500]  And when you go see the new Wonder Woman movie,
[23:58.500 --> 24:00.740]  it's all about an EAS system taken over the world.
[24:00.740 --> 24:02.500]  Well, we actually have that.
[24:02.500 --> 24:05.100]  Actually have satellites that take over all the broadcast.
[24:05.100 --> 24:07.460]  They have systems that hack in and take over the internet.
[24:07.460 --> 24:09.900]  And they have the first level is all those systems
[24:09.900 --> 24:12.700]  where they put lower thirds or at the top.
[24:12.700 --> 24:14.580]  Hey, anybody's talking about COVID.
[24:14.580 --> 24:16.300]  Anybody's talking about the election.
[24:16.300 --> 24:18.580]  It hijacks the page and redirects you.
[24:18.580 --> 24:20.460]  That was all the internet kill switch
[24:20.460 --> 24:22.140]  and they put it in under Obama.
[24:22.140 --> 24:24.980]  So that's why big tech is all working in lockstep
[24:24.980 --> 24:26.260]  with the same messages
[24:26.260 --> 24:27.740]  because Obama and the deep state
[24:27.740 --> 24:29.900]  were in control of that the whole time.
[24:29.900 --> 24:31.540]  Now I got that information to Trump
[24:31.540 --> 24:34.180]  and that's when all hell broke loose two years ago.
[24:36.020 --> 24:37.260]  And they blocked him.
[24:37.260 --> 24:39.620]  I mean, so the president's been trying to get control of this.
[24:39.620 --> 24:42.340]  You're like, well, if the guys on nuclear submarines
[24:42.340 --> 24:43.780]  didn't do what the president told him,
[24:43.780 --> 24:45.300]  he couldn't just take over the subs
[24:45.300 --> 24:46.140]  and know how to run them.
[24:46.140 --> 24:47.460]  He didn't know how to open the door.
[24:47.460 --> 24:49.420]  He didn't know how to flood the torpedo tubes
[24:49.420 --> 24:51.740]  or run the reactor. I don't either.
[24:51.740 --> 24:53.020]  So when you say, well, why didn't Trump
[24:53.020 --> 24:55.180]  get control of the EAS satellites?
[24:55.180 --> 24:56.780]  Most of it's classified.
[24:58.180 --> 25:00.660]  The public knows about EAS stations
[25:00.660 --> 25:03.100]  that you tune to locally and EAS scramblers
[25:03.100 --> 25:06.540]  and EAS takeover systems at the transmission sites
[25:06.540 --> 25:08.380]  and at the studio level.
[25:08.380 --> 25:10.700]  Anybody on a radio station or TV station that picks us up
[25:10.700 --> 25:13.060]  knows about their EAS, cable, broadcast TV,
[25:13.060 --> 25:13.900]  everything's got it.
[25:13.900 --> 25:15.980]  But that's only one level of EAS.
[25:15.980 --> 25:20.300]  EAS 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 is already in place.
[25:20.300 --> 25:22.420]  And the new Wonder Woman movie throws it right in your face.
[25:22.420 --> 25:24.420]  They've had satellites 30 years
[25:24.420 --> 25:27.140]  that can take over all the main transmissions.
[25:27.140 --> 25:31.580]  So I wanna explain.
[25:32.860 --> 25:35.380]  Trump should take control of the EAS.
[25:35.380 --> 25:37.340]  Obama has been in control of it.
[25:38.340 --> 25:42.340]  That's EAS, that's federal law in control of big tech.
[25:42.340 --> 25:46.780]  Big tech is the NSA, Google is the NSA.
[25:46.780 --> 25:48.620]  And Trump never got the briefings
[25:48.620 --> 25:51.100]  and never told how all this works in shadow government.
[25:51.100 --> 25:53.900]  They use the shadow government system on the president
[25:53.900 --> 25:57.060]  to keep it from him and kept him compartmentalized.
[25:57.060 --> 25:58.420]  You've read the articles where they brag they go,
[25:58.420 --> 26:01.700]  he signed an executive order and then we just threw it away.
[26:02.940 --> 26:05.060]  That, by the way, is an executionable offense,
[26:05.060 --> 26:07.620]  but they just did it because they're a bunch of
[26:07.620 --> 26:09.780]  jackass three-piece suit lawyers
[26:09.780 --> 26:12.380]  that think they're smarter than everybody.
[26:13.380 --> 26:15.100]  Trump's like Sidney Powell and General Flynn
[26:15.100 --> 26:16.340]  were supposed to be here today at noon.
[26:16.340 --> 26:18.220]  Sorry, sir, we don't know where they are.
[26:18.220 --> 26:21.340]  So Trump's gotta go get their phone number and call them.
[26:23.220 --> 26:25.700]  Then they show up and they ordered a secret service
[26:25.700 --> 26:27.380]  not to let him in.
[26:27.380 --> 26:29.460]  Yeah, that's how this country's run.
[26:29.460 --> 26:31.660]  So yeah, Trump should take over the EAS
[26:31.660 --> 26:33.540]  for the last 22 days.
[26:33.540 --> 26:35.620]  He could have his messages force fed to everyone.
[26:35.620 --> 26:37.180]  People are like, oh my God, that's martial law.
[26:37.180 --> 26:39.260]  Well, that's what Obama and the deep state are doing.
[26:39.260 --> 26:41.140]  What do you think all that comes from?
[26:41.140 --> 26:43.740]  Unified on every phone, every damn system.
[26:43.740 --> 26:46.180]  Hard breaking in, feeding it to you.
[26:46.180 --> 26:48.220]  That's EAS, baby.
[26:48.220 --> 26:50.820]  That's emergency alert system.
[26:50.820 --> 26:51.660]  Well, we'll be right back.
[26:51.660 --> 26:52.500]  Stay with us.
[26:55.500 --> 26:58.060]  It's not a secret why in the leftist controlled cities
[26:58.060 --> 27:00.380]  all over the world, not just the U.S.,
[27:00.380 --> 27:03.220]  they encourage people to live in tense cities as homeless
[27:03.220 --> 27:06.140]  and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime.
[27:06.140 --> 27:07.660]  It's because the globalists admit
[27:07.660 --> 27:11.180]  under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course, the Great Reset,
[27:11.180 --> 27:13.940]  they want to lower expectations.
[27:13.940 --> 27:15.060]  They don't want you to think of having
[27:15.060 --> 27:16.340]  sanitary systems everywhere.
[27:16.340 --> 27:18.220]  They don't want you to think of a civilization
[27:18.220 --> 27:19.060]  that gets better.
[27:19.060 --> 27:20.340]  They want you to think of civilization
[27:20.340 --> 27:22.540]  that gets progressively worse.
[27:22.540 --> 27:24.300]  The globalists fly around in private jets.
[27:24.300 --> 27:26.420]  They have huge private mistakes.
[27:26.420 --> 27:28.060]  They are separate from us.
[27:28.060 --> 27:29.900]  Their children go to private tutors.
[27:29.900 --> 27:31.140]  They admit this.
[27:31.140 --> 27:32.900]  Now they want us locked down,
[27:32.900 --> 27:34.780]  telecommunicating with each other
[27:34.780 --> 27:37.940]  so that we are not actually out physically building
[27:37.940 --> 27:39.660]  a pro-human infrastructure.
[27:39.660 --> 27:41.900]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G
[27:41.900 --> 27:45.180]  is meant to control robot autonomous cars and trucks.
[27:45.180 --> 27:46.940]  This is all their admitted plan.
[27:46.940 --> 27:48.140]  The public's finally listening
[27:48.140 --> 27:50.220]  because the plan is no longer in beta.
[27:50.220 --> 27:51.420]  It's gone operational.
[27:51.420 --> 27:52.860]  It's a post-human future.
[27:52.860 --> 27:55.060]  You better find out about it right now.
[27:55.060 --> 27:59.740]  Fight for Trump and January 6th in Washington, D.C.
[27:59.740 --> 28:02.740]  Our fight to drain the Washington swamp
[28:02.740 --> 28:06.620]  and reclaim America's destiny has just begun.
[28:06.620 --> 28:08.900]  It's 1776 time.
[28:08.900 --> 28:11.220]  Yeah!
[28:11.220 --> 28:13.460]  On November 14th, hundreds of thousands
[28:13.460 --> 28:16.180]  of American patriots gathered in the nation's capital
[28:16.180 --> 28:19.060]  to stop the biggest election steal in American history.
[28:19.060 --> 28:22.020]  America is going under leftist martial law.
[28:22.020 --> 28:24.060]  And as a communist Chinese agent,
[28:24.060 --> 28:26.180]  Joe Biden is able to get in there.
[28:26.180 --> 28:28.660]  He will put America under permanent lockdowns
[28:28.660 --> 28:31.780]  siege until we're brought to our knees.
[28:31.780 --> 28:33.020]  Got it!
[28:33.020 --> 28:35.980]  Hundreds of thousands returned to D.C. in December.
[28:35.980 --> 28:37.300]  We will never give up.
[28:37.300 --> 28:38.620]  We will never surrender.
[28:38.620 --> 28:40.980]  We will never back down to the state panic,
[28:40.980 --> 28:43.820]  pedophile, globalist, new order.
[28:43.820 --> 28:46.340]  January 6th, fight for Trump.
[28:46.340 --> 28:47.980]  D.C., be there.
[28:47.980 --> 28:49.100]  We will never give in.
[28:49.100 --> 28:50.220]  We will never give up.
[28:50.220 --> 28:51.900]  And we will never back down.
[28:51.900 --> 28:54.820]  We will never, ever surrender.
[28:54.820 --> 28:56.740]  Three, two, one.
[28:56.740 --> 28:57.420]  Here we go!
[28:57.420 --> 28:58.220]  It's back in stock.
[28:58.220 --> 28:59.660]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[28:59.660 --> 29:00.980]  They couldn't get it because the lockdown,
[29:00.980 --> 29:02.820]  the pollen block is back in stock.
[29:02.820 --> 29:04.140]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[29:04.140 --> 29:05.940]  But the power of quail egg concentrate,
[29:05.940 --> 29:07.260]  pollen block acts differently.
[29:07.260 --> 29:08.220]  The traditional line of history means
[29:08.220 --> 29:09.260]  that it's clinically studied,
[29:09.260 --> 29:11.100]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[29:11.100 --> 29:12.660]  by helping to clear signage passages
[29:12.660 --> 29:14.140]  and aiding respiratory function.
[29:14.140 --> 29:15.340]  It's amazing.
[29:15.340 --> 29:16.820]  Folks absolutely love it.
[29:16.820 --> 29:18.460]  And again, France has been shut down,
[29:18.460 --> 29:19.740]  so we couldn't get it.
[29:19.740 --> 29:21.940]  Now, a limited supply is back in stock,
[29:21.940 --> 29:24.580]  25% off at infowarstore.com.
[29:24.580 --> 29:28.340]  Pollen block, again, is available in this one minute ad.
[29:28.340 --> 29:29.980]  I don't have time to tell you all about it.
[29:29.980 --> 29:32.100]  But believe me, I have really wanted it back in
[29:32.100 --> 29:33.820]  because it works naturally,
[29:33.820 --> 29:35.500]  unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter
[29:35.500 --> 29:38.140]  that makes you all be speedy and irritable
[29:38.140 --> 29:39.420]  and gives you a headache.
[29:39.420 --> 29:40.980]  This is naturally occurring.
[29:40.980 --> 29:42.900]  It's the secret of how the quail
[29:42.900 --> 29:44.420]  don't have the seasonal distress
[29:44.420 --> 29:47.900]  and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us.
[29:47.900 --> 29:49.620]  You chew up the pills, they taste great.
[29:49.620 --> 29:52.260]  It's available again, infowarstore.com.
[29:52.260 --> 29:54.420]  Pollen block, infowarstore.com.
[29:54.420 --> 29:57.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:24.420 --> 30:36.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting
[30:36.420 --> 30:38.420]  to the clients of the New World Order.
[30:41.420 --> 30:43.420]  We are the emergency alert system
[30:43.420 --> 30:45.420]  against the globalist takeover.
[30:47.420 --> 30:49.420]  You know, next segment's the longest segment of the hour.
[30:49.420 --> 30:52.420]  I'm gonna show you the documents, the statistics from the CDC.
[30:52.420 --> 30:55.420]  These are up to date, up to the day
[30:55.420 --> 30:58.420]  of the number of COVID patients where they're at per hospital.
[30:58.420 --> 31:00.420]  It's all registered, it's all there.
[31:00.420 --> 31:03.420]  I'm gonna show you Austin hospitals
[31:03.420 --> 31:07.420]  at 9% capacity for COVID
[31:08.420 --> 31:13.420]  and 77 patients with COVID, most of which are there.
[31:13.420 --> 31:16.420]  It says for observation and are not on ventilators.
[31:17.420 --> 31:20.420]  But the hospital knows they get 50 plus thousand dollars
[31:20.420 --> 31:22.420]  for getting you in.
[31:22.420 --> 31:24.420]  And so they code it as COVID.
[31:24.420 --> 31:29.420]  Unbelievable information from the federal government's own database.
[31:29.420 --> 31:31.420]  So when you hear the Austin mayor or the LA mayor
[31:31.420 --> 31:34.420]  or your globalist leader, it's all the same program,
[31:34.420 --> 31:36.420]  whether you're in Perth, Australia,
[31:36.420 --> 31:39.420]  whether you're in Paris, France, or whether you're in Ottawa, Canada,
[31:39.420 --> 31:43.420]  it's the same BS from the same UN, the same Agenda 21, Agenda 2030,
[31:43.420 --> 31:45.420]  the same great reset.
[31:45.420 --> 31:48.420]  I can play you, Klaus Schwab.
[31:48.420 --> 31:51.420]  I can play you, Boris Johnson.
[31:51.420 --> 31:55.420]  I can play you, Justin Trudeau, all saying this is a UN
[31:55.420 --> 31:58.420]  world government takeover to put you on a universal income
[31:58.420 --> 32:01.420]  and have a world ID and force inoculations.
[32:01.420 --> 32:03.420]  Would you like me to play it for you?
[32:03.420 --> 32:05.420]  We've already played it all.
[32:07.420 --> 32:09.420]  So next segment, I'm gonna go to those statistics.
[32:11.420 --> 32:15.420]  This segment, I wanted just to get to some of these videos.
[32:15.420 --> 32:17.420]  We've got them out of San Antonio, Texas.
[32:17.420 --> 32:21.420]  We got them out of New Jersey.
[32:21.420 --> 32:23.420]  We got them out of Norfolk.
[32:23.420 --> 32:25.420]  We got them out of New York.
[32:25.420 --> 32:27.420]  We got them out of LA.
[32:27.420 --> 32:32.420]  We've got them out of everywhere where people are in CVSs,
[32:32.420 --> 32:34.420]  people at their businesses, and they're saying,
[32:34.420 --> 32:36.420]  no, I'm not wearing a mask and we're not closing our doors.
[32:36.420 --> 32:37.420]  We're essential.
[32:37.420 --> 32:39.420]  And this is a bunch of crap.
[32:41.420 --> 32:43.420]  I think people go to the woman they go.
[32:43.420 --> 32:46.420]  In fact, we'll play the CVS club first.
[32:46.420 --> 32:50.420]  They go, but the hospitals are all full.
[32:50.420 --> 32:51.420]  It's on the news.
[32:51.420 --> 32:52.420]  They're dying.
[32:54.420 --> 32:56.420]  You can go look at the LA hospitals.
[32:58.420 --> 33:00.420]  There's over a hundred of them.
[33:00.420 --> 33:03.420]  And two of them say they're full and it's not COVID.
[33:03.420 --> 33:05.420]  And there's hospitals full all the time.
[33:07.420 --> 33:10.420]  When I cut my finger off, an ambulance was there.
[33:10.420 --> 33:11.420]  Because I got to the boat dock.
[33:11.420 --> 33:13.420]  We called it before I got there on the cell phone.
[33:13.420 --> 33:16.420]  They were calling different hospitals to see which one wasn't full
[33:16.420 --> 33:19.420]  or which one wasn't busy because it was a Saturday afternoon.
[33:21.420 --> 33:24.420]  And they took me to the one hospital that didn't have an overflow
[33:24.420 --> 33:26.420]  and I still had to wait a couple hours.
[33:26.420 --> 33:28.420]  I had my finger reattached.
[33:31.420 --> 33:34.420]  So they play on ignorance.
[33:34.420 --> 33:37.420]  And now they're saying, we got to lock everything down.
[33:37.420 --> 33:40.420]  Don't leave your house, period, or don't leave your house at night.
[33:40.420 --> 33:42.420]  All dog training.
[33:42.420 --> 33:43.420]  All witch hunt.
[33:43.420 --> 33:44.420]  All chicken and little garbage.
[33:44.420 --> 33:46.420]  And I'll show you the damn numbers.
[33:46.420 --> 33:48.420]  And I'll show you where to go to your town or your city.
[33:48.420 --> 33:51.420]  And then you can find the hospitals when they're on the news saying,
[33:51.420 --> 33:54.420]  we're here at the Elmhurst hospital where it's totally overwhelmed.
[33:54.420 --> 33:58.420]  You can see long lines of patients and people go to the famous hospitals
[33:58.420 --> 34:00.420]  in New Jersey, New York, Dallas, Texas.
[34:00.420 --> 34:02.420]  You've seen the hundreds of videos.
[34:04.420 --> 34:06.420]  And they show up and no one's there.
[34:06.420 --> 34:07.420]  So they start staking it out.
[34:07.420 --> 34:09.420]  They go into the front area.
[34:09.420 --> 34:12.420]  No one's in there, but a nurse.
[34:12.420 --> 34:13.420]  And so they wait.
[34:13.420 --> 34:15.420]  The next time they see the live news a week later this happened in New Jersey
[34:15.420 --> 34:18.420]  in New York, they run down.
[34:18.420 --> 34:23.420]  And there are people in hazmat gear, actors going in and out in circles.
[34:23.420 --> 34:24.420]  Remember that 10 months ago?
[34:24.420 --> 34:27.420]  And it turned out to all be fake.
[34:27.420 --> 34:29.420]  Remember Jason Jones in Hawaii?
[34:29.420 --> 34:33.420]  He hears on the news, the COVID centers are full.
[34:33.420 --> 34:34.420]  Everyone's positive.
[34:34.420 --> 34:35.420]  There's long lines.
[34:35.420 --> 34:36.420]  He goes there.
[34:36.420 --> 34:38.420]  It's closed.
[34:38.420 --> 34:41.420]  He goes to another one.
[34:41.420 --> 34:44.420]  He wants to get tested because he's been in LA.
[34:44.420 --> 34:45.420]  He actually feels bad.
[34:45.420 --> 34:49.420]  He goes there and they won't testing and no one's there.
[34:49.420 --> 34:52.420]  Then he sees them the next day on TV saying they're full.
[34:52.420 --> 34:57.420]  He drives over there and they threaten to have him arrested.
[34:57.420 --> 34:59.420]  But forget that.
[34:59.420 --> 35:00.420]  People say, oh yeah, really?
[35:00.420 --> 35:01.420]  Right.
[35:01.420 --> 35:02.420]  Sure.
[35:02.420 --> 35:06.420]  We have the damn federal registry.
[35:06.420 --> 35:10.420]  I want to play these clips separately or we won't be here on air anymore.
[35:10.420 --> 35:13.420]  We need to fund our operation plus we got some really exciting news.
[35:13.420 --> 35:17.420]  We've been sold out of our activated charcoal highest quality concentrate
[35:17.420 --> 35:20.420]  toothpaste without the fluoride, without the aspartame.
[35:20.420 --> 35:22.420]  It's amazing, high quality.
[35:22.420 --> 35:23.420]  People love it.
[35:23.420 --> 35:27.420]  Couldn't get it for three plus months once it was sold out because of the
[35:27.420 --> 35:31.420]  COVID disruptions, the shutdowns, it warehouses, the ingredient problems,
[35:31.420 --> 35:32.420]  the chain reactions.
[35:32.420 --> 35:35.420]  We have it after three plus months being sold out.
[35:35.420 --> 35:37.420]  We have it on and off, activated charcoal, Dr. Jones Naturals
[35:37.420 --> 35:41.420]  in fullwarstore.com, fluoride free.
[35:41.420 --> 35:45.420]  Even more exciting because in Texas right now is the Mountain Juniper
[35:45.420 --> 35:48.420]  or cedar season with the clouds of dust and the rest of it.
[35:48.420 --> 35:50.420]  My allergies kick up.
[35:50.420 --> 35:52.420]  The whole office has been for months.
[35:52.420 --> 35:53.420]  Where's the pollen block?
[35:53.420 --> 35:54.420]  Where's the pollen block?
[35:54.420 --> 35:55.420]  We want to buy some.
[35:55.420 --> 35:57.420]  Because of the lockdown, this comes from France.
[35:57.420 --> 35:59.420]  It's where they have the proprietary special quail that are fed a special
[35:59.420 --> 36:03.420]  secret diet where it produces this natural anihistamine that works so
[36:03.420 --> 36:04.420]  well.
[36:04.420 --> 36:09.260]  they have patents, they have it all. We private label it and discount it. They've been shut
[36:09.260 --> 36:15.340]  down. So we had our order in before this hysteria hit and they were behind a year ago. Finally,
[36:15.340 --> 36:19.540]  they got us one quarter of the shipment. They still are offering to refund our money. We
[36:19.540 --> 36:25.780]  say, no, we want the rest. A small shipment of pollen block has come in. And believe me,
[36:25.780 --> 36:31.180]  it's amazing. You chew it up in your mouth. It tastes sweet naturally. And it is the eggshell,
[36:31.180 --> 36:37.300]  the egg itself, all of it. And they just discovered that these birds don't have allergies and don't
[36:37.300 --> 36:42.540]  have problems and that when you eat their eggs, you don't have them. So it's amazing. It works
[36:42.540 --> 36:47.060]  better for a lot of people than, you know, even drugs do. It's just what God gave us. Pollen
[36:47.060 --> 36:57.020]  block back in stock, infowarstore.com, 113 reviews, 94%, 4.8 stars, pollen block, infowarstore.com.
[36:57.020 --> 37:01.500]  Works great for most people. Some people doesn't work for them. That's just the way our bodies are
[37:01.500 --> 37:05.620]  all different. But for me, it works really, really good. I say it knocks them down when I
[37:05.620 --> 37:09.820]  religiously take it about 90%. When I forget only take it once I'm having an allergy attack,
[37:09.820 --> 37:15.540]  then it knocks it down by about half. So it's a big, big deal, folks. So both of those back
[37:15.540 --> 37:21.860]  pollen block and the activated charcoal back in stock, infowarstore.com. It's also been back in
[37:21.860 --> 37:27.580]  stock for a week and a half. And it's already half sold out is winter sun vitamin D3 highest
[37:27.580 --> 37:32.060]  quality with vitamin K for your immune system for you, for your children, for adults, for old
[37:32.060 --> 37:37.180]  people, especially you need your D3. As Joe Rogan pointed out, I went viral last week, you
[37:37.180 --> 37:43.100]  got a scientist on explaining D3 is actually a hormone. It's not a vitamin. They call it a
[37:43.100 --> 37:48.660]  vitamin. D3 is a hormone off which everything in your body is built on. So it's just as
[37:48.660 --> 37:54.900]  important as iodine. They argue like, is it C? Is it D? Or is it is it iodine? They're all like
[37:54.900 --> 38:00.460]  the things, okay? By the way, it's been sold out X2 back in stock. It just came in today. I'm
[38:00.460 --> 38:04.740]  going to even put it on the site yet, but X2 highest quality with crystal iodine. That is back
[38:04.740 --> 38:09.780]  in stock. Okay, let's go out to break. It's a four minute video. The full things on info wars.
[38:09.780 --> 38:15.580]  Here's a lady in CVS not wearing her mask. She gets the years off. It's less people died in 2000
[38:15.580 --> 38:20.660]  than died in 2019. And that is from the CDC's numbers as well. They go, well, not all the new
[38:20.660 --> 38:24.660]  numbers are in yet. Okay, whatever. The point is, it's going to be about the same. So that shows
[38:24.660 --> 38:29.660]  you, we're in the same type deal. They're portioning regular deaths into the COVID thing. Here's part
[38:29.660 --> 38:30.140]  of that video.
[38:31.220 --> 38:35.500]  There's like 36 people with COVID in the ICU. Whenever there's a flu, there's only two or three
[38:35.500 --> 38:41.180]  patients out of time in the ICU. So literally the entire hospital is COVID patients. This has never
[38:41.180 --> 38:45.820]  happened. And how many I'm not saying they're I'm not saying COVID's not real. I'm just saying I'm
[38:45.820 --> 38:50.460]  not sick. I'm not sick. An asymptomatic spread has been shown to be a myth. So why am I going to be
[38:50.460 --> 38:56.500]  treated like a sick person? Do you know that there have been fewer deaths overall in 2019 than
[38:56.500 --> 39:02.060]  there were in 2018? Look it up. Fewer deaths overall, all they've done is recategorize all the
[39:02.060 --> 39:08.580]  deaths. This is not what they're telling us. It is a lie. This is a lie. I'm telling you. It's a
[39:08.580 --> 39:14.420]  lie. And everyone's fine. And it will go on and on and on as long as they feed us this lie and we
[39:14.420 --> 39:19.780]  comply with it. And I'm done tonight. I reached a breaking point. I'm done. I know I'm not reaching
[39:19.820 --> 39:27.580]  anyone here. I'm not doing that on my face. I'm not. I'm not going to play all of them next hour. But
[39:27.580 --> 39:31.100]  first I promise I'm going to come in and get the statistics, the numbers, the facts and show you the
[39:31.100 --> 39:35.140]  total proof of the fraud. Sure, go to the hospital show it simply when they say it's full. That's
[39:35.140 --> 39:39.860]  important. But we'll show you their own government website saying it's a total lie. We have local
[39:39.860 --> 39:46.020]  newscast saying go hospitals totally full. They got like 15 patients with COVID. It's all lies. All
[39:46.020 --> 39:50.660]  lies. And they're running the same hysteric lies they ran six months ago again. And they're gonna do it
[39:50.660 --> 39:57.380]  over and over again as long as we buy it. Mountain Patriot in Colorado. Thank you for holding. How
[39:57.380 --> 40:01.380]  are you doing, Alex? Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother,
[40:01.380 --> 40:07.380]  how are you? I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that DNA force. I love it. I've been
[40:07.380 --> 40:12.180]  using it quite a while. And I just went looked at the ingredients again the other day. And I see
[40:12.180 --> 40:19.300]  that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkala has cited,
[40:19.940 --> 40:26.980]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine. And it helps channel the zinc into the cell. So
[40:26.980 --> 40:33.060]  people might want to take a look at that. All I know is with DNA force, we went out and looked at
[40:33.060 --> 40:37.860]  these high end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the
[40:37.860 --> 40:41.380]  doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle. Because there's a lot of expensive product in them. It's
[40:41.380 --> 40:46.660]  really only cost them like 50 bucks. And so we basically cloned two different top brands together.
[40:46.660 --> 40:49.300]  And that's what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[40:49.300 --> 40:57.380]  Dr. Merkala's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[40:57.940 --> 41:03.380]  Other dictionaries have somewhere else. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out
[41:03.380 --> 41:10.340]  force for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[41:10.340 --> 41:15.700]  until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see
[41:15.700 --> 41:20.820]  the headlines from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought. COVID more
[41:20.820 --> 41:26.580]  dumbest thing they could ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million people would be dead
[41:26.580 --> 41:32.740]  just eight months ago, within three months. Okay. It's a quarter million. If you count all of the
[41:32.740 --> 41:37.860]  people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had comorbidity. These are real numbers. These
[41:37.860 --> 41:42.820]  are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out,
[41:42.820 --> 41:46.900]  and are taught we're not essential. Well, the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[41:46.900 --> 41:52.900]  You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[41:55.380 --> 42:02.100]  The Post Industrial World. That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio
[42:02.100 --> 42:10.660]  de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992. Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post
[42:10.660 --> 42:14.900]  industrial world plows swat with the Davos group. Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada,
[42:14.900 --> 42:21.700]  they're all on record saying the great reset is Agenda 2030. Well, you might want to find out what
[42:21.700 --> 42:28.340]  Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction of society as we know it. It is making the population more
[42:28.340 --> 42:30.980]  by designs. We can be controlled with a medical
[42:31.860 --> 42:37.060]  technology over you and your family. They're destroying civilization, rebuild it in their
[42:37.060 --> 42:44.500]  dystopic image. We are fighting this at info wars.com and news wars.com. We are fighting
[42:44.500 --> 42:50.020]  for a pro human future and we need you to get the facts to research and share it with others
[42:50.020 --> 43:08.500]  and join the fight. God bless you. Visit us, spread the word at infowars.com.
[43:09.700 --> 43:17.700]  infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been
[43:17.700 --> 43:26.580]  banned. That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it. But Soros and Bill Gates
[43:26.580 --> 43:35.220]  and the globalists are on our tail. But the new website is the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[43:35.220 --> 43:40.980]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them. So the new URL that
[43:40.980 --> 43:45.780]  links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special
[43:45.780 --> 43:51.140]  reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video. Share the link,
[43:51.140 --> 43:54.180]  the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[43:54.180 --> 44:12.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:24.980 --> 44:34.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:46.580 --> 44:49.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to lay out for you
[44:49.220 --> 45:02.020]  the absolute proof of total criminal fraud by the hospitals, by the media, by the CDC because
[45:02.020 --> 45:06.420]  they go on the news and they say we've got to lock down the economy. You can't leave your house for a
[45:06.420 --> 45:11.380]  few months. We're going to have 2.5 million dead in just a few months. The hospitals are already
[45:11.380 --> 45:15.540]  overwhelmed and the people went to the very hospitals. You saw the hundreds of videos.
[45:15.540 --> 45:19.300]  YouTube couldn't take them down fast enough. It was like whack-a-mole where people would see the
[45:19.300 --> 45:25.060]  hospital full. They'd drive down there and it'd be empty. They wanted to see it for themselves
[45:25.060 --> 45:29.460]  because people don't trust media. In Texas, in New Jersey, in California, in New York,
[45:30.180 --> 45:35.860]  hundreds of videos in the UK people went in and they even caught them with the actors
[45:35.860 --> 45:41.460]  dressed up in hazmat suits for photo shoots and they turned away millions of people that
[45:41.460 --> 45:46.980]  had real illnesses. Remember they said in Florida in some leftist jurisdictions like Broward County,
[45:46.980 --> 45:51.380]  we will not resuscitate you if you're having a heart attack because the hospitals are too full,
[45:51.380 --> 45:58.660]  we'll let you die. Now what's the motive? If you get a COVID patient, you get $13,000. If you
[45:58.660 --> 46:08.500]  intubate them, you get an additional $40,000. That's $53,000. USA Today confirms. If you have a certain
[46:08.500 --> 46:13.140]  number of COVID patients, then your hospital gets, depending on its size, millions of extra
[46:13.140 --> 46:20.260]  dollars in federal funds. So here's the motive. They're making a bunch of money and the big hospital
[46:20.260 --> 46:25.220]  groups are mainly owned by insurance companies who all over the world now, it's the same global plan,
[46:26.420 --> 46:33.700]  all over the world, have not been doing the knee surgeries, the shoulder surgeries, the hip
[46:33.700 --> 46:44.260]  surgeries, the hernia surgeries. All the things they can claim are elective and so they're not
[46:44.260 --> 46:49.300]  having to pay the doctors or the nurses and the insurance money you're paying is piling up. See
[46:49.300 --> 46:55.380]  how this works? This is technological fraud organized at the UN level run by big pharma,
[46:55.380 --> 47:00.580]  the big banks, the big insurance companies. They admit all this. They're all making record profits,
[47:00.580 --> 47:05.300]  big techs making record profits. China's making record profits and bragging that America
[47:05.300 --> 47:12.340]  will never open again and China will now not surpass us in 2035, but China will surpass the U.S.
[47:12.340 --> 47:22.100]  because of the COVID lockdown we have here in 2028 in just seven years. Now, there's the
[47:22.100 --> 47:28.660]  fact sheet. Your precious USA Today, scroll the bottom. Do you get paid for COVID patients extra?
[47:28.660 --> 47:35.620]  And the answer is $53,000. The answer is yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And don't believe me, show
[47:35.620 --> 47:44.180]  them again. China'd overtake U.S. economy because of COVID virus in 2028. So it's not just the mode
[47:44.180 --> 47:48.740]  of the history of the background. Then they admit China released it and Fauci and Gates were involved
[47:48.740 --> 47:55.220]  and they had tabletop exercises and said this is just a drill. So now you see these headlines,
[47:55.220 --> 48:01.780]  overhead shot please. LA County hospitals reach the breaking point. Turn away ambulances.
[48:04.980 --> 48:10.020]  Hospitals across the U.S. reach breaking point as coronavirus surges. Remember, we all heard this
[48:10.020 --> 48:15.540]  10 months ago. Remember, stay inside. Don't leave your house. Reports, emergency hospitals
[48:15.540 --> 48:22.100]  dismantled despite claim hospitals worse than first wave. Infowars.com actually goes in
[48:22.100 --> 48:26.580]  to the federal registry of the numbers and shows them dismantling the emergency centers from New
[48:26.580 --> 48:32.500]  York, New York to Dallas, Texas to LA, all those big empty facilities that you see governors and
[48:32.500 --> 48:36.500]  others touring. And then when Trump pointed it out, the media said, how dare you say COVID isn't a
[48:36.500 --> 48:41.540]  problem. They're also reporting in the Europe that they're dismantling the emergency centers.
[48:42.340 --> 48:46.260]  We have links to all of that. So they're shutting down all the overflow centers.
[48:46.260 --> 48:52.740]  And now they'll list a certain wing of a hospital as COVID. And then when that fills up, they go,
[48:52.740 --> 48:56.500]  oh, we're at the breaking point. It's all bureaucratic. It's like if you had two gas tanks on your
[48:56.500 --> 49:01.460]  truck and one of them was almost on empty and you told your kids, hey, we're going to have to walk
[49:01.460 --> 49:06.740]  home. We're 10 miles from home. We're out here in the desert. The tank's on empty. And then all
[49:06.740 --> 49:12.580]  of a sudden your dad or your uncle, when you're scared, flips the switch and goes to auxiliary
[49:12.580 --> 49:17.220]  tank. And it shows that you're full. My uncle did that once we were way out the middle of the
[49:17.220 --> 49:23.620]  boondocks hunting. And he said, oh, we're running out of gas. Look, look, look. And he was teasing
[49:23.620 --> 49:27.460]  me when I was like eight years old. And he was acting like it was going and he goes, look, we're
[49:27.460 --> 49:31.940]  on empty. And then he goes, watch this and flip to the other tank. It's the same game. Oh, we're,
[49:31.940 --> 49:36.100]  we're full. We're full. There's all the empty hospital, but the little COVID wing is full.
[49:36.100 --> 49:45.060]  But let me show you the numbers. Look at this LA County hospitals are at the breaking point.
[49:45.060 --> 49:52.420]  Turn away ambulances. Coronavirus in Texas, curfew possibility for Austin as ICU beds run low.
[49:52.420 --> 50:00.420]  Don't leave your house at night. Austin KXAN. Federal data reveals which hospitals are dangerously
[50:00.420 --> 50:05.780]  full this week is yours. And then you link to the federal government's CDC website from in
[50:05.780 --> 50:08.420]  PR. But they know you're not going to link through.
[50:11.060 --> 50:14.100]  They're saying federal data shows you've got a billion dollars in your bank account,
[50:14.100 --> 50:19.700]  but you really don't. We go to federal data reveals which hospitals are dangerously full
[50:19.700 --> 50:25.700]  this week is yours. And then when I go check Austin that they say is overwhelmed,
[50:26.740 --> 50:29.460]  and I click on Travis County, it took me five seconds.
[50:29.460 --> 50:39.300]  Travis County is at 9% hospital bed capacity for COVID-19. There are 77 people currently
[50:39.300 --> 50:46.500]  in the hospital in Travis County with COVID-19 70.
[50:50.820 --> 50:53.940]  And you can actually pull up the data from the actual document. This is just some of the pages.
[50:53.940 --> 50:59.140]  Go ahead and pull that up. Travis County, Texas. So I'm begging everybody to go add these numbers
[50:59.140 --> 51:00.420]  up. It's 77 people.
[51:04.820 --> 51:10.100]  And then it gives you all the numbers and it shows you they're at 9%. Average hospital in
[51:10.100 --> 51:16.500]  County is at 9% right there at the bottom. So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:19.300 --> 51:26.340]  St. David's is at 7% capacity. Uh-oh. St. David's South Austin Medical Center is at 20% capacity.
[51:26.340 --> 51:36.580]  Uh-oh. Ascension Seaton. Oh, no, this one. They're at 13%. Oh, no, we're all dead. You
[51:36.580 --> 51:41.700]  average together 9% capacity. 77 patients.
[51:44.660 --> 51:49.940]  Oh, but look, California now has the worst COVID-19 spread in the US spread. It's not
[51:49.940 --> 51:56.580]  dying from it. But see, when they turn the PCR test up 10 times, 20 times, 45 times,
[51:57.220 --> 51:59.940]  you get that data too. Hospitals admit what they're doing. They calibrate it.
[52:02.020 --> 52:05.460]  You look at leftist cities, communist countries, socialist areas,
[52:06.900 --> 52:10.180]  they all turn it up. Everybody locked down. Unless you're communist, China,
[52:10.180 --> 52:14.900]  they now say they're COVID free because they locked everything down and arrested people and
[52:14.900 --> 52:20.340]  took everybody. No, they didn't. That was all theater. To teach us how to act, to teach us
[52:20.340 --> 52:25.380]  how to behave. Now, let me move you to the bigger issue. Just showed you all that. You've got the
[52:25.380 --> 52:30.100]  easiest place to find it because these federal websites are so big that you can get lost in it
[52:30.900 --> 52:36.740]  is NPR. I'll give you the NPR headline one more time. You go right there. You click on it.
[52:36.740 --> 52:45.620]  You're on the CDC. Up to the date. Up to the day numbers. One day behind. Okay. Let me give you
[52:45.620 --> 52:50.820]  that headline one more time. Federal data reveals which hospitals are dangerously full this week
[52:51.380 --> 52:59.860]  is yours. NPR.org. It has a link directly to the CDC where you can put in your county and find out.
[52:59.860 --> 53:08.660]  And it gets worse. I went and checked the data that John Hopkins checked in September and found
[53:08.660 --> 53:13.860]  that the numbers the CDC is putting in are actually dropping faster than they were. And so it looks
[53:13.860 --> 53:18.420]  like we'll have less deaths this year when things close out in three days than they had last year.
[53:19.140 --> 53:23.300]  Isn't that interesting? Did you hear what I just said? It's not going to be the same amount of deaths
[53:23.300 --> 53:34.420]  in 2019. It's going to be less, less, less. So remember those numbers. The same or less deaths
[53:34.420 --> 53:40.500]  this year. Period. However people are dying in America, less people are dying in the middle
[53:40.500 --> 53:44.980]  of the worst pandemic the world's ever seen. They say it's like the Spanish flu that killed
[53:46.500 --> 53:51.700]  50 million people they estimate. And major studies report that 80% of those that died
[53:51.700 --> 53:56.740]  started dying once everyone started wearing the mask because of bacterial pneumonia that spread
[53:56.740 --> 54:02.100]  and they didn't have antibiotics yet and they didn't know it was the bacteria. And you had
[54:02.100 --> 54:06.980]  millions of rundown soldiers coming back who had no immune system who had been eating crappy food
[54:06.980 --> 54:12.740]  in the trenches and they were dying in mass and then giving it to others in that winter.
[54:15.300 --> 54:21.380]  That's what happens in wars. So there's facts. Now I haven't hit the latest the actual UN document
[54:21.380 --> 54:26.660]  where they admitted solid hoax and for power and control bigger than the great reset. It was first
[54:26.660 --> 54:29.940]  in a Canadian document. They tried to say, well, we're not sure what's real, but we were able to
[54:29.940 --> 54:33.540]  search the document and find other documents for other countries that confirm it is real.
[54:34.980 --> 54:40.660]  We have you now. We'll be back. Our number two straight ahead. This is the info war.
[54:44.260 --> 54:48.660]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would. They've always been
[54:48.660 --> 54:53.540]  part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse. If they're able to keep Trump from
[54:53.540 --> 54:59.460]  rightfully taking office for second term, Ontario 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer
[54:59.460 --> 55:03.940]  harder than ever on this Republic. They are going to explode gas prices. They're going to shut down
[55:03.940 --> 55:08.820]  our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to us. So it's impossible for
[55:08.820 --> 55:13.700]  factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is economic war. We are being
[55:13.700 --> 55:18.820]  consolidated. We're being taken over. The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[55:18.820 --> 55:23.300]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them
[55:23.300 --> 55:27.140]  absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure
[55:27.140 --> 55:31.780]  and property. This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is.
[55:31.780 --> 55:36.580]  Cloud swab and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing is. So your business
[55:36.580 --> 55:42.740]  is only a 25% for several more years. No small businesses will be there. This is a master plan.
[55:42.740 --> 55:50.100]  Say no. It's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S.
[55:50.100 --> 55:54.340]  They encourage people to live in tense cities as homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and
[55:54.340 --> 55:59.620]  engage in petty crime. It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030,
[55:59.620 --> 56:04.500]  of course the great reset, they want to lower expectations. They don't want you to think of
[56:04.500 --> 56:08.340]  having sanitary systems everywhere. They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets
[56:08.340 --> 56:13.220]  better. They want you to think of civilization that gets progressively worse. The globalists fly
[56:13.220 --> 56:18.500]  around in private jets. They have huge private estates. They are separate from us. Their children
[56:18.500 --> 56:24.020]  go to private tutors. They admit this. Now they want us to lock down telecommunicating with each
[56:24.020 --> 56:30.020]  other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure. The infrastructure
[56:30.020 --> 56:35.700]  that's left under 5G is meant to control robot autonomous cars and trucks. This is all their
[56:35.700 --> 56:40.180]  admitted plan. The public is finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta. It's
[56:40.180 --> 56:43.860]  gone operational. It's a post-human future. You better find out about it right now.
[56:47.780 --> 56:50.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:50.420 --> 57:17.220]  In 2016 the Department of Labor predicted that Americans would continue dropping out of the
[57:17.220 --> 57:26.500]  workforce in record numbers. They predicted and projected a decade of sluggish growth and they
[57:26.500 --> 57:35.300]  expected unemployment over 5 percent and really 6, 7 and even in some cases 8 percent for years to
[57:35.300 --> 57:44.100]  come. The so-called experts said the Americans had no choice but to accept stagnation, decay,
[57:44.100 --> 57:52.740]  and a shrinking middle class as the new normal. I knew that if we lifted these burdens from our
[57:52.740 --> 58:00.820]  economy and unleashed our people to pursue their ambitions and realize their limitless potential,
[58:01.700 --> 58:08.420]  then economic prosperity would come thundering back to our country at a record speed.
[58:08.420 --> 58:15.140]  Today I'm proud to stand before you as president of the United States to report that we have delivered
[58:16.020 --> 58:22.820]  on our promises and exceeded our expectations by a very wide margin.
[58:23.380 --> 58:28.900]  Richard Ries, my good friend, sends me a clip of Patrick Byrne who is advising Trump for many
[58:28.900 --> 58:33.620]  months. I knew this didn't want to tell people he didn't want me to. It was at the White House with
[58:33.620 --> 58:39.540]  Powell and with Flynn for four hours last week. They did discuss civil emergency. They did discuss
[58:39.540 --> 58:44.420]  the insurrection act because we're facing a foreign takeover. All of these people are being told
[58:44.420 --> 58:50.900]  if you do good work and get the president out the door on January 20, there'll be jobs waiting
[58:50.900 --> 58:55.380]  for you, million-a-half-dollar, two-man-dollar jobs at Sullivan-Cromwell and places like that.
[58:55.380 --> 59:04.500]  And you'll be accepted in socialite circles in New York. If you don't, all that goes away.
[59:04.500 --> 59:10.500]  And numerous younger people in the administration are being told just get the president to concede.
[59:10.500 --> 59:13.460]  Just get him to concede. Help him get in transition mode.
[59:13.460 --> 59:17.940]  Trump is totally surrounded. Basically, he's got less than 10 percent of his original staff.
[59:17.940 --> 59:21.700]  The Marines are still there flying around the helicopter. That's about it. But everybody
[59:21.700 --> 59:25.460]  copping out on Trump, we elected him. It's not about even his policies at this point.
[59:26.340 --> 59:32.420]  It's that globalists are involved in a hostile takeover with Joe Biden who says America is doomed.
[59:32.420 --> 59:35.220]  This country is doomed.
[59:35.220 --> 59:39.300]  They don't want America to even exist. They're globalists that have partly to deal
[59:39.300 --> 59:44.900]  to end the country and use our diversity as a weapon against us, okay? And God tells me
[59:44.900 --> 59:49.380]  you don't sit there and engage in this type of evil. You don't play God. Well, Bill Gates broke
[59:49.380 --> 59:54.660]  that rule. This virus, are we looking at 2022, 2023, when we feel like we'll have this virus
[59:54.660 --> 1:00:01.300]  under control around the world? A few things like getting their health systems and vaccination
[1:00:01.300 --> 1:00:07.060]  rates back up. You can probably get that back in shape within three or four years.
[1:00:07.700 --> 1:00:14.740]  The poverty impacts and educational impacts will be more like 10-plus years.
[1:00:14.740 --> 1:00:23.700]  I recently took the COVID-19 vaccination. After the shot, I felt fine. But within three days,
[1:00:24.340 --> 1:00:32.020]  I went to the doctor because I had problems with my face. The whole left side of my face,
[1:00:32.020 --> 1:00:40.740]  actually. I have Bill Halsey now. We support you. I do know my rights. Please do not touch me.
[1:00:40.740 --> 1:00:46.420]  Do not touch me. Do not touch me. Do not touch me. It is our constitution, our rights.
[1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:52.340]  You do not have, you are public servants. You do not have the authority to,
[1:00:54.020 --> 1:01:00.180]  you do not have the authority to impose any of your fake codes, California codes,
[1:01:00.820 --> 1:01:04.340]  on us or our children. It is our constitution, our rights.
[1:01:05.220 --> 1:01:10.340]  What, if anything, will change in three weeks under President Biden? What policy
[1:01:10.340 --> 1:01:13.060]  levers can be pulled that haven't yet already been tried?
[1:01:14.340 --> 1:01:19.940]  Well, you will see him invoking the Defense Production Act. The idea there is to make sure
[1:01:19.940 --> 1:01:27.380]  that the personal protective equipment, the test capacity and the raw materials for the vaccines
[1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:32.820]  are produced in adequate supply so that those aren't limiting steps in all of this.
[1:01:33.700 --> 1:01:38.900]  And I think you're also going to see a major increase in testing. You're going to see a lot
[1:01:38.900 --> 1:01:46.900]  more testing because if we don't see those invisible, so to speak, the mild and asymptomatic
[1:01:46.900 --> 1:02:12.900]  cases of disease, if you don't know they exist, we'll be back. Stay with us.
[1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:22.820]  America is going under leftist martial law and the communist Chinese agent Joe Biden is able
[1:02:22.820 --> 1:02:28.900]  to get in there. He will put America under permanent lockdown siege until we're brought to our knees.
[1:02:30.660 --> 1:02:36.180]  Hundreds of thousands return to DC in December. We will never give up. We will never surrender.
[1:02:36.180 --> 1:02:41.460]  We will never back down to the state panic, pedophile, globalist, new world order.
[1:02:41.460 --> 1:02:45.540]  January 6th, fight for Trump. DC be there.
[1:02:45.540 --> 1:02:51.300]  We will never give in. We will never give up and we will never back down. We will never ever
[1:02:51.300 --> 1:03:19.060]  surrender. Despite the attempts by big tech and corrupt government institutions,
[1:03:19.060 --> 1:03:27.540]  as well as the United Nations and Big Pharma, despite their attempts, their fraud is coming out.
[1:03:28.660 --> 1:03:33.060]  Despite all the attempts by the globalists, despite all the attempts by the globalists
[1:03:33.060 --> 1:03:38.420]  and their minions, despite the chikams, despite the EU, despite Hollywood, despite the mainstream
[1:03:38.420 --> 1:03:44.020]  media, despite Big Pharma, despite all the leftist sheeple running around bleeding and
[1:03:44.020 --> 1:03:50.980]  demanding that we submit to their endless medical martial law tyranny, we have hundreds of thousands
[1:03:50.980 --> 1:03:57.620]  of doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and nurses that everywhere are educating people in
[1:03:57.620 --> 1:04:02.900]  mass about the real science of COVID-19, where it came from and what really happened.
[1:04:04.260 --> 1:04:09.860]  Let me just briefly recap this incredible information. Last hour, at the end of the hour,
[1:04:09.860 --> 1:04:16.020]  I showed you CDC statistics that NPR is linked to themselves when they're hyping up into the
[1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:21.540]  world. The hospitals are full, but when you go to the CDC's own numbers that we have the maps for
[1:04:22.180 --> 1:04:30.180]  right here and you click on Travis County, where Austin, Texas is based, where they're saying
[1:04:30.180 --> 1:04:35.140]  there's basically martial law is needed and lockdowns are needed and all this craziness is needed
[1:04:35.140 --> 1:04:46.340]  and you find out that the hospitals are at 9% capacity and they've got 77 serious COVID patients
[1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:52.420]  and let me show you those numbers, but here it is at 9% capacity at the hospitals,
[1:04:53.220 --> 1:04:59.460]  9%, zoom in on that if you can, and then here's the Austin American Statesman article about it
[1:04:59.460 --> 1:05:12.100]  saying 77 people in the hospitals with COVID and if you continue here, you see the headlines
[1:05:12.100 --> 1:05:16.500]  around the country, hospitals across the U.S. reaching breaking point as coronavirus surges,
[1:05:16.500 --> 1:05:20.500]  oh, they're turning away the ambulances, but we've got reports in the U.S. and the U.K.
[1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:24.180]  that they're shutting down all those extra emergency centers that they set up, that they're
[1:05:24.180 --> 1:05:29.700]  closing those, emergency hospitals are being dismantled despite claim hospitalizations worse
[1:05:29.700 --> 1:05:36.820]  than the first wave, but here's the article out of KXAN television in Texas curfew a possibility
[1:05:36.820 --> 1:05:45.220]  for Austin as ICU beds run low, but I just showed you from the CDC's own website and the easiest
[1:05:45.220 --> 1:05:54.100]  place to find the sub area of the CDC website is to go to an article that is in NPR and
[1:05:54.100 --> 1:05:59.460]  that's right here, federal data reveals which hospitals are dangerously full this week is yours,
[1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:03.860]  so when you hear that on the local news, you can go check your city, your county
[1:06:04.740 --> 1:06:10.740]  by just going to that article and it's got a link to it, so they tell you it's all doomed,
[1:06:10.740 --> 1:06:17.940]  they're all full, everyone's dying, record evil, none of it is true and they are counting people
[1:06:17.940 --> 1:06:22.500]  that have the flu or have pneumonia as COVID-19, people that have heart failure, they're calling it
[1:06:22.500 --> 1:06:30.420]  COVID-19 because they get 53,000 extra dollars when they do it, wow is that not totally and
[1:06:30.420 --> 1:06:39.300]  completely insane, but guess what else is going on with COVID-19? Jeffrey Epstein's last cellmate
[1:06:39.300 --> 1:06:44.180]  who was transferred out of a cell the day before he got his neck broken dies from coronavirus,
[1:06:44.180 --> 1:06:50.740]  at first they wouldn't say why he died suddenly, but now they're saying it's coronavirus and of
[1:06:50.740 --> 1:06:56.260]  course again if you get hit by a car, if you get eaten by a shark, if you die jumping out of a
[1:06:57.060 --> 1:07:00.980]  airplane skydiving, they call it that, if you die on a motorcycle they call them, if you die
[1:07:00.980 --> 1:07:07.700]  of a gunshot wound they call it that, so talk about Bill Barr tying up loose ends, Jeffrey
[1:07:07.700 --> 1:07:14.020]  Epstein's last cellmate dies from coronavirus, report says Fox News, the last man known to have
[1:07:14.020 --> 1:07:19.620]  shared a jail cell with the late Jeffrey Epstein one day before he was killed has died of coronavirus
[1:07:19.620 --> 1:07:27.780]  or the Easter Bunny killing, F rain rains, 51 was found dead November 27th inside his mother
[1:07:27.780 --> 1:07:32.740]  apartment in New York City, police confirm to the New York Daily News, oh found dead,
[1:07:34.420 --> 1:07:40.340]  Epstein liked to read a lot and he kept himself, he wasn't a problem starter or too loud, my uncle
[1:07:40.340 --> 1:07:48.500]  said, he was a good cellmate, his niece said, the Daily News reports that Reyes was transferred to a
[1:07:48.500 --> 1:07:55.060]  private prison the day before Epstein hanged himself in August 2019 and it was there that
[1:07:55.060 --> 1:08:02.500]  he contracted the coronavirus, oh so he was found dead in his apartment and they're telling you it
[1:08:02.500 --> 1:08:07.940]  was coronavirus, let me tell you who else died of COVID-19, please pull up the Sir Bruder film,
[1:08:07.940 --> 1:08:14.580]  please, that's right little did you know but the coronavirus COVID-19 got in a time machine and went
[1:08:14.580 --> 1:08:26.900]  back to Dallas in the fall of 1963 and that's how John F Kennedy died, in fact Hitler died in
[1:08:26.900 --> 1:08:30.820]  World War II, people thought he escaped to Argentina, truth is coronavirus killed him too,
[1:08:30.820 --> 1:08:35.700]  the Hindenburg was brought down by the coronavirus, I mean it's that ridiculous,
[1:08:35.700 --> 1:08:41.220]  ladies and gentlemen, he's found dead in his apartment and now the same corrupt New York
[1:08:41.220 --> 1:08:48.820]  system tells us that that's what happened, absolutely insane, absolutely incredible,
[1:08:48.820 --> 1:08:54.820]  absolutely over the top, now I haven't hit all the other coronavirus news, I think I
[1:08:55.620 --> 1:08:59.300]  skimmed over the first three or four articles with about 40 articles I've got right here, so let me
[1:08:59.300 --> 1:09:02.980]  just read you, just give you an idea of what's going on and a lot of this you would have already
[1:09:02.980 --> 1:09:06.340]  heard from us, we warned you it was all coming because it's all in the UN plan, people keep asking
[1:09:06.340 --> 1:09:09.700]  how do we know all this stuff's coming, well because it's a UN plan, I mean it's like you're
[1:09:09.700 --> 1:09:13.460]  reading a play and if you've already read the play before you go see the play you know what's
[1:09:13.460 --> 1:09:18.980]  going to happen, so let's just go over it for you right now, World Health Organization,
[1:09:18.980 --> 1:09:24.180]  bigger pandemic than COVID is coming and world governments need to counter it, remember Bill
[1:09:24.180 --> 1:09:28.580]  Gates said that on television a few months ago, he said oh this is just a drill, the real one's
[1:09:28.580 --> 1:09:32.900]  coming, you've been such good slaves that you've behaved so well so we're going to use this even
[1:09:32.900 --> 1:09:37.620]  more, whistleblower, globalist planning more lockdowns to usher in universal basic income,
[1:09:37.620 --> 1:09:41.140]  well yeah I mean whistleblower, hell it's cloud swab and all admitted, I mean it's right there,
[1:09:42.740 --> 1:09:46.420]  of course it's now admitted that China is bragging that the COVID will destroy us and keep us
[1:09:46.420 --> 1:09:50.020]  locked down, not COVID but the lockdown from it because they control us and then the globalists
[1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:54.500]  are all invested in China so their investments all go up, then after a decade of us being in
[1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:57.540]  a depression they bring the money back from China and buy it all up for the dollar,
[1:09:59.860 --> 1:10:06.020]  continuing here, UK professor lockdown, again this is the UK professor who designed the lockdown
[1:10:06.020 --> 1:10:12.260]  Bragg's adopting CHICOM model allowed British government to get away with the shutdowns and
[1:10:12.260 --> 1:10:16.980]  China's example helped them lead the way and now the UK is the example of the world for future
[1:10:16.980 --> 1:10:24.180]  lockdowns, Rubio says elites tricking Americans into taking vaccines and that we shouldn't trust
[1:10:24.180 --> 1:10:30.740]  them and that the elites are in a bubble, wow, appeals court says Governor Cuomo's lockdown
[1:10:30.740 --> 1:10:35.060]  restrictions on religious gatherings violated the constitution but they still keep doing it,
[1:10:35.060 --> 1:10:39.140]  saying your church is not essential, your restaurant is not essential, your bar is not
[1:10:39.140 --> 1:10:44.660]  essential, your dojo is not essential, your auto parts store is not essential but all the big
[1:10:44.660 --> 1:10:51.540]  establishment things and when Cuomo wanted to go and let the Grammys go forward or was the Emmys,
[1:10:51.540 --> 1:10:57.620]  it was the Emmys, he then got an Emmy for the great job he's done with COVID, how sick and
[1:10:57.620 --> 1:11:03.060]  disgusting, Nobel Peace Prizes are worthless, Emmys are worthless, Oscars are worthless,
[1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:07.380]  these are like anchors around your necks, these are signs of how disgusting you are.
[1:11:10.660 --> 1:11:18.660]  UK again continues its lockdown, epic, unmasked woman stands her ground when confronted by
[1:11:18.660 --> 1:11:22.180]  mask Nazis, I played part of that earlier, I'm gonna put the whole thing when we come back,
[1:11:23.140 --> 1:11:27.620]  horror, Nashville, nurse gets bells palsy from vaccine, we're gonna play that again
[1:11:27.620 --> 1:11:31.380]  and then I've already mentioned this but here it is, John Hopkins University newsletter,
[1:11:31.380 --> 1:11:35.300]  ranch studies saying COVID, relatively no effect on deaths in the US,
[1:11:35.300 --> 1:11:38.900]  they deleted it after publication because they pointed out, well the year's not over,
[1:11:38.900 --> 1:11:46.980]  well they did year to date, they did, they did January 1st, 2019 to the point in September they
[1:11:46.980 --> 1:11:51.300]  were, they did the same thing here and found the same amount of deaths roughly, well they said,
[1:11:51.300 --> 1:11:55.860]  well that isn't for the whole year, so now we're almost, the year's almost over, I went and looked
[1:11:55.860 --> 1:12:02.580]  at the numbers, looks like there'll be less deaths in 2020 total than last year, it's all a hoax,
[1:12:02.580 --> 1:12:08.980]  it's all a fraud, it's all a scam, here's the newsletter right here, a closer look at US deaths
[1:12:08.980 --> 1:12:13.700]  due to COVID-19, and remember they're using all the fake stuff, people that out of other things as
[1:12:13.700 --> 1:12:19.940]  COVID death, that's why the numbers are staying relatively the same, new study of 10 million
[1:12:19.940 --> 1:12:25.220]  Chinese finds asymptomatic COVID spread never existed, everything we were first told isn't
[1:12:25.220 --> 1:12:30.500]  true, journalists hounded after pointing out that only old and sick die from COVID, they just put
[1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:35.140]  that on the death certificate, everybody that dies now, former CDC chief calls for immunity
[1:12:35.140 --> 1:12:40.660]  passports to prove COVID vaccine before travel, even though the head of the WHO says it won't
[1:12:40.660 --> 1:12:45.380]  even protect you, and the insurance companies, the same ones making money while the hospitals are
[1:12:45.380 --> 1:12:56.340]  shut down, not giving care, are the ones pushing the whole deal, they'll be back, stay with us.

[1:15:41.460 --> 1:15:54.020]  well khalia michel is a nurse in tennessee in nashville and people go on and check she's a nurse
[1:15:54.020 --> 1:15:57.940]  that happened to her it's happening all over the place they admit that you can get bell's palsy
[1:15:57.940 --> 1:16:04.260]  or your face being paralyzed or a lot worse, guillomba rays, narcolepsy, permanent epilepsy,
[1:16:04.260 --> 1:16:07.940]  well you can just have a convulsion and die too that's what happens to a lot of little babies
[1:16:07.940 --> 1:16:12.340]  when you take vaccines but this vaccine they admitted is going to have a lot more reactions
[1:16:12.340 --> 1:16:19.700]  bill gates admitted that other vaccines is not a vaccine it's an mRNA mutinogen that just begins
[1:16:19.700 --> 1:16:24.340]  cell by cell to take over every cell in your body reprogramming them and it's got the whole
[1:16:24.340 --> 1:16:30.580]  genome of a dead boy from 1966 in it that's in the patent of the fizer one it's got jellyfish
[1:16:30.580 --> 1:16:38.420]  genes and you go study the other mra ones they're even crazier and even top scientists say we don't
[1:16:38.420 --> 1:16:44.020]  know why they're putting jellyfish genes in people we just know this is really really dangerous so
[1:16:44.020 --> 1:16:49.220]  we don't just need resistance to this we don't just need congress to stop the censorship and and
[1:16:49.220 --> 1:16:55.140]  not let you know big tech engage in a cover-up because they're partially owned by big pharma
[1:16:55.140 --> 1:17:00.260]  google and others are merged with big pharma bill gates is heavily invested in in facebook
[1:17:01.860 --> 1:17:09.460]  zuckerberg basically works for bill gates this is racketeering to have big tech with big pharma
[1:17:09.460 --> 1:17:14.420]  with the media suppressing consumer reviews and people that don't want to take this and they've
[1:17:14.420 --> 1:17:20.420]  got liability protection and they admit it reprograms ourselves i mean imagine 20 years ago
[1:17:20.420 --> 1:17:25.780]  we're talking about monsanto taking over all the crops with their gmo and don't produce seeds
[1:17:25.780 --> 1:17:29.380]  anymore that produce new plants so you got to buy it each year from them and then all the
[1:17:29.380 --> 1:17:35.220]  weird health problems that animals have eating the gmo that are in studies now they're going to
[1:17:35.220 --> 1:17:41.940]  go in and make you a gmo product they were announcing we're going to release a mrna
[1:17:42.660 --> 1:17:48.100]  vaccine into oak trees that changes the genetics of all oak trees people be against it
[1:17:48.100 --> 1:17:54.980]  but they're doing it to humans and the reaction is so bad they go oh there's no long-term problems
[1:17:54.980 --> 1:17:56.580]  they did no long-term studies
[1:18:00.180 --> 1:18:04.420]  so they're just setting the president to hurt us out in the open and to get all the hospitals and
[1:18:04.420 --> 1:18:09.460]  the doctors and the media on board so when this causes mass carnage and mass death like autism
[1:18:09.460 --> 1:18:13.780]  but worse everybody goes along with the cover-up because well we all did it for the right reason
[1:18:13.780 --> 1:18:20.420]  my grandmother was a great lady but she's like alex i know that i told you and your mother told you
[1:18:20.420 --> 1:18:24.660]  that i got polio from the polio vaccine but i've decided the doctors meant well and i don't want
[1:18:24.660 --> 1:18:28.500]  you to talk about it or tell my story it's just not christian to be a troublemaker
[1:18:29.540 --> 1:18:34.180]  paralyzed her she's a beautiful woman had two children my mother was four years old when she
[1:18:34.180 --> 1:18:38.500]  got it from the second round of the polio shot and the doctor told her she got it from the live
[1:18:38.500 --> 1:18:44.900]  virus polio vaccine and my grandmother was on crutches for the rest of her life in incruciating
[1:18:44.900 --> 1:18:54.980]  pain but she said that's okay see we adapt to accepting them violently attacking us
[1:18:55.780 --> 1:19:00.020]  yeah bill gates they admit Reuters is the number one cause of polio worldwide is vaccines but so
[1:19:00.020 --> 1:19:06.740]  why paralyze the little black kids is liberal he gives money to black lives matter which says
[1:19:06.740 --> 1:19:13.780]  sterilize men and don't have a family it's the same message die die die die and now some pro-vaccine
[1:19:13.780 --> 1:19:18.020]  youtubers went out one black lady an asian guy to this clinic and they were like wait a minute why
[1:19:18.020 --> 1:19:22.980]  are you giving the asian guy one vaccine her another well there's one for men that does something for
[1:19:22.980 --> 1:19:29.540]  men and one for women you're like i thought it's for covid 19 it's a little special no we got something
[1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:39.460]  for you that's how it works but here let's go to this poor lady miss michael there in tennessee
[1:19:39.460 --> 1:19:49.460]  and what happened to her in nashville hi i am a registered nurse in nashville tennessee and my name
[1:19:49.460 --> 1:19:58.900]  is kaliba michael i'm reaching out to everyone about the covid 19 vaccination i recently took
[1:19:58.900 --> 1:20:08.660]  the covid 19 vaccination after the shot i felt fine but within three days i went to the doctor
[1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:17.940]  because i had problems with my face the whole left side of my face actually um i have bell
[1:20:17.940 --> 1:20:30.020]  pausing now and as you can see i can't smile as i'm trying to smile i'm just kind of embarrassed
[1:20:30.020 --> 1:20:40.100]  but i just want everyone to know that i think this vaccination is the worst thing ever and i
[1:20:40.100 --> 1:20:49.940]  would not give this to anybody even my worst enemy please america they do not care about us
[1:20:50.660 --> 1:21:00.340]  do not take this vaccination uh ma'am it's worse than that sweetheart they want to kill you they
[1:21:00.340 --> 1:21:05.300]  want to kill me okay and they want to normalize it and have you just take it okay bill gates
[1:21:05.300 --> 1:21:09.540]  his father's own record his main mission is to take out black folks but he wants to get everybody
[1:21:09.540 --> 1:21:16.260]  don't worry but he's liberal so it's okay it's like apple runs the biggest death camps in china
[1:21:16.260 --> 1:21:22.980]  it's all right he's liberal he gives money the black lives matter and he's gay so it's okay
[1:21:22.980 --> 1:21:30.820]  it's okay if you're gay to kill all day gay gay gay okay let's go ahead and go to the owner of

[1:24:08.660 --> 1:24:13.620]  all these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it they even admit that they're doing it for power
[1:24:14.260 --> 1:24:19.860]  and control and that they're not even worried about covid-19 that's what claus swappeth others have
[1:24:19.860 --> 1:24:24.740]  said think about how it's saying that oh and big tech's got to track you they've got to trace you

[1:24:46.180 --> 1:24:53.620]  mind control we are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare the united nations the
[1:24:53.620 --> 1:24:58.100]  big corporations the globalists big tech and big pharma are all pushing the cup is the most deadly
[1:24:58.100 --> 1:25:03.780]  thing in history even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold but if you are deficient
[1:25:03.780 --> 1:25:07.940]  then you can actually die from it that's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes
[1:25:07.940 --> 1:25:12.980]  meanwhile all these top scientists and and and researchers and former phyzer head medical
[1:25:12.980 --> 1:25:18.340]  officers have come out and said that the covid-19 vaccine especially the mRNA ones are basically
[1:25:18.340 --> 1:25:23.220]  bio weapons that are super deadly and now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically
[1:25:23.220 --> 1:25:27.540]  when they take it just like newborn babies they give vaccines they have to resuscitate them all
[1:25:27.540 --> 1:25:31.860]  the time or a lot of times they just let them die and that's on the record it does that geon
[1:25:31.860 --> 1:25:36.580]  morays narcolepsy cancer all these other diseases but they tell you safe and effective no one's

[1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:44.980]  deadly so they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly
[1:25:44.980 --> 1:25:51.780]  dangerous because the media says it's safe they do it due to the covid lockdown destroying the

[1:27:09.540 --> 1:27:20.500]  well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[1:27:25.220 --> 1:27:29.140]  okay if you see the new wonder woman movie which actually went and saw
[1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:35.140]  sunday night it's for as stupid as those movies are it was still had a lot of messages in it was
[1:27:35.140 --> 1:27:41.300]  still entertaining the the villain basically takes over a mind controls the us president
[1:27:42.020 --> 1:27:48.340]  who's ronald reagan it's wonder woman 1984 and he takes over the eas emergency satellite system
[1:27:48.340 --> 1:27:55.540]  that's able to commandeer all the media in the world this is a cartoon version of it but they do
[1:27:55.540 --> 1:28:00.340]  have satellites they can do that they do have big jamming systems on the ground eas is wired into
[1:28:00.340 --> 1:28:06.740]  all the major radio and tv stations cable stations and broadcast stations most of the stations we're
[1:28:06.740 --> 1:28:12.900]  on here in the united states are directly wired into it a few of their sub channels aren't and any
[1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:18.900]  engineer will tell you that but beyond the eas that what i call 2.0 3.0 remember that all the
[1:28:18.900 --> 1:28:23.460]  stories 12 years ago are so about obama and this kill switch they were putting in and they said but
[1:28:23.460 --> 1:28:28.420]  it won't be like where they totally killed each other tv messages will be put into your phone
[1:28:28.420 --> 1:28:35.060]  browser into your computer browser into your cars uh uh you uh tv monitor communication system
[1:28:35.620 --> 1:28:40.900]  your display and people said oh jones is crazy that'll never happen i was reading what was in
[1:28:40.900 --> 1:28:46.180]  the federal bills what was in the law now obama before he left in the defense authorization
[1:28:46.180 --> 1:28:52.020]  act of 2017 which again they passed in 2016 which he signed right before trump was inaugurated four
[1:28:52.020 --> 1:29:00.020]  years ago said that they put billions of dollars into countering foreign disinformation propaganda
[1:29:00.020 --> 1:29:09.620]  act and then that was put into the cog and the eas system so when ivan rakeland at twitter r-a-i-k-l-i-n
[1:29:09.620 --> 1:29:14.340]  a former green beret a recovering lawyer ultra marathoner operating at the intersection of
[1:29:14.340 --> 1:29:18.580]  national security startups politics and law he also has a lot of stuff at duck duck go does a
[1:29:18.580 --> 1:29:23.140]  lot of stuff with general flan and it's been at the defense intelligence agency when he comes out
[1:29:23.140 --> 1:29:28.100]  in his tweet trump's been retweeting him lately and says trump needs to take control of the eas
[1:29:28.100 --> 1:29:33.300]  system i have tried to tell trump doesn't mean he commandeers the you know the nfl it doesn't
[1:29:33.300 --> 1:29:36.820]  mean he breaks in over every channel though that might be needed he can still do that from the
[1:29:36.820 --> 1:29:42.260]  resolute desk and just everybody tune in anyways but messages from him in the browsers instead of
[1:29:42.260 --> 1:29:47.380]  you have an android if you have an iphone or any other system you see those hard-coded messages
[1:29:47.380 --> 1:29:51.860]  the top of apple news or when you type in anything about covet or about the election whether it's on
[1:29:51.860 --> 1:29:56.900]  twitter facebook youtube google it has messages at the top and sometimes overrides you and sends you
[1:29:56.900 --> 1:30:03.860]  somewhere else that's the phase in of the eas system 2.0 that the democrats put into place so
[1:30:03.860 --> 1:30:09.780]  trump never learned about that they kept him away from that that's now admitted and so when
[1:30:09.780 --> 1:30:16.020]  ivan rakeland says trump should take over eas he's absolutely right he should take over the
[1:30:16.020 --> 1:30:21.940]  countering foreign propaganda disinformation act that is still statutorily there the funding
[1:30:21.940 --> 1:30:26.580]  phased out within two years uh but but it's still operating those are shadow networks
[1:30:26.580 --> 1:30:32.420]  but as president he has 22 days to rally the people to rally the states with that sign of strength
[1:30:32.420 --> 1:30:38.100]  taking over the eas system which again i'll be attacked for this the deep states already in
[1:30:38.100 --> 1:30:43.540]  control of the eas it's a lot bigger than this is an emergency broadcast if this was a real emergency
[1:30:43.540 --> 1:30:49.460]  you would tune in here for weather or that's the old eas since the cold war that's only one part of
[1:30:49.460 --> 1:30:54.820]  it this is the newer system so ivan who's a constitutional recovering lawyer as he said
[1:30:54.820 --> 1:30:58.500]  he's here with us tell folks what you think the president should do you've tweeted out about it as
[1:30:58.500 --> 1:31:04.900]  well so yeah alex absolutely so the president if you're listening and anybody within the orbit
[1:31:04.900 --> 1:31:09.540]  of the president needs to activate the emergency alert system i'll tell you why i agree everything
[1:31:09.540 --> 1:31:14.980]  what you're saying alex he needs to do so in order to be able to let the nation know of all
[1:31:14.980 --> 1:31:19.460]  the cyber attacks that have been occurring we're starting to see some of it come out a few weeks
[1:31:19.460 --> 1:31:23.860]  ago we saw the treasury department was attacked we saw the entire u.s. government unclassified
[1:31:23.860 --> 1:31:29.380]  systems were attacked so we're getting attacked by foreign adversaries by china potentially other
[1:31:29.380 --> 1:31:35.300]  countries to include iran and russia that needs to be put out in an alert via the alert system
[1:31:35.300 --> 1:31:40.900]  because everything that this president is putting out is under the the big tech and big media always
[1:31:40.900 --> 1:31:47.140]  says oh he's doing that in order to uh it's not accurate because it has something to do with the
[1:31:47.140 --> 1:31:51.380]  election or he's questioning the election so they censor him they block him you can't like you can't
[1:31:51.380 --> 1:31:56.900]  retweet in order to circumvent the entire big media uh manipulation in order to circumvent all
[1:31:56.900 --> 1:32:02.820]  of big tech like you're saying he has one mechanism to do that until truth to the american public of
[1:32:02.820 --> 1:32:07.940]  the crisis that we're currently in and not only are we being attacked uh critical infrastructure
[1:32:07.940 --> 1:32:13.300]  in the u.s. government but the nation as a whole and part of that critical infrastructure is our
[1:32:13.300 --> 1:32:18.260]  electoral system and so tonight i argue that yesterday would have been a perfect day to start
[1:32:18.260 --> 1:32:24.900]  that but this evening at nine p.m. from tonight until january sixth in the morning so not every
[1:32:24.900 --> 1:32:31.220]  single hour of the day but in the evening he needs to give a prime time address laying out say for
[1:32:31.220 --> 1:32:36.740]  example tonight day one foreign interference and attacks on our entire national critical
[1:32:36.740 --> 1:32:41.060]  infrastructure and as one of those subcomponents he needs to bring out the director of national
[1:32:41.060 --> 1:32:47.060]  intelligence d&i ratcliffe as he explains what he's been able to come up with in an unclassified
[1:32:47.060 --> 1:32:52.260]  fashion according to his executive order 13848 now do you remember just hold on for a second
[1:32:52.260 --> 1:32:56.580]  we're keep walking through this you're absolutely right do you remember two years ago they got really
[1:32:56.580 --> 1:33:01.860]  upset when somebody in the administration used it and sent out alerts from the president but
[1:33:01.860 --> 1:33:06.820]  it was on hurricanes and things and the left freaked out and said don't let trump use the eas
[1:33:06.820 --> 1:33:10.820]  because they're already in control of it like a swiss army knife though they haven't done the
[1:33:10.820 --> 1:33:16.100]  national address they've just been doing again the orders to google facebook all of them to hard
[1:33:16.100 --> 1:33:20.500]  code folks don't know that's being hard-coded by obama and hillary that still have control on
[1:33:20.500 --> 1:33:25.780]  record that's why brennan clapper are still in control this is insane so so so and i totally agree
[1:33:25.780 --> 1:33:32.980]  you shouldn't announce the the civil emergency or or the insurrection right up front right up front
[1:33:32.980 --> 1:33:37.300]  the thing to do is just start communicating now with people about the country's under attack from
[1:33:37.300 --> 1:33:41.940]  china that you know here's the examples of what happened with solar winds and because that's what
[1:33:41.940 --> 1:33:46.820]  it's meant to be doing not scaring us with fake covid numbers not not not telling us that trump
[1:33:46.820 --> 1:33:52.420]  lost the election and no one is allowed to question it they're using eas agreements to push that
[1:33:52.420 --> 1:33:58.820]  man absolutely so we start off with the national emergency which is the whole reason why this system
[1:33:58.820 --> 1:34:03.380]  was created it's the president's prerogative to decide what that national emergency is and i don't
[1:34:03.380 --> 1:34:07.860]  think anybody can argue that and he's he will be able to through the system communicate to all
[1:34:07.860 --> 1:34:14.740]  300 and whatever it is now 20 30 million people in the united states circumventing the the uh
[1:34:14.740 --> 1:34:19.220]  those folks that are trying to counter his narrative of truth and under that system
[1:34:19.220 --> 1:34:24.260]  him who will lay it out with his executive branch the d and i the secretary of the treasurer will
[1:34:24.260 --> 1:34:28.100]  be able to speak for a few minutes to articulate specifically what happened with the attack on
[1:34:28.100 --> 1:34:32.740]  the treasury department and go down the list the secretary of defense can talk about what the
[1:34:33.300 --> 1:34:38.500]  department of defense sees in terms of foreign adversarial uh attacks on the united states
[1:34:38.500 --> 1:34:44.180]  so won't just be the president it'll be the entire cabinet as it has touch points on foreign
[1:34:44.180 --> 1:34:49.700]  interference secretary of state and i have a spreadsheet on my pen tweet that really outlines
[1:34:49.700 --> 1:34:54.500]  who each person and what role they play and what they need to articulate the following day so say
[1:34:54.500 --> 1:35:00.660]  for example tomorrow the entire executive branch needs to start using under this eas system again
[1:35:00.660 --> 1:35:07.460]  every night at nine p.m and then moving into tomorrow they can cover say for example nevada
[1:35:07.460 --> 1:35:12.900]  what has what have foreign governments done in nevada as it applies to foreign interference in
[1:35:12.900 --> 1:35:18.340]  our elections i believe nevada was the state that submitted information on all registered
[1:35:18.340 --> 1:35:24.580]  individuals in that state to pakistani intelligence services if i'm not mistaken i think it was nevada
[1:35:24.580 --> 1:35:29.220]  so those are things that we need to know about as a country to what to determine whether or not
[1:35:29.220 --> 1:35:34.180]  we're gonna have confidence at all in the outcome of this election and not not only does it educate
[1:35:34.180 --> 1:35:41.060]  us as a people this entire process under the emergency alert system educates us congress
[1:35:41.060 --> 1:35:45.860]  in preparation for his their vote on whether they're going to object or not on january 6
[1:35:45.860 --> 1:35:52.180]  also prior to january 6 it educates all of your state legislatures in all of these five six states
[1:35:52.180 --> 1:35:57.220]  that are contested to see what all the federal executive branch holdings of information is
[1:35:57.780 --> 1:36:02.500]  that could potentially impact their decision to recall the biden slate of electors and
[1:36:02.500 --> 1:36:07.220]  incorporate this information to submit a uh an electoral i don't want to stop you right there
[1:36:07.220 --> 1:36:11.460]  i want to stop you right there as far as while this sounds the people that aren't informed on it
[1:36:11.460 --> 1:36:17.620]  i want to explain i just showed people the new york times and other publications saying the un is
[1:36:17.620 --> 1:36:22.580]  in control of our emergency alert system through a un agreement for a global pandemic that's why
[1:36:22.580 --> 1:36:26.820]  it's all standardized the president has been cut out of this because he wasn't outsider and didn't
[1:36:26.820 --> 1:36:33.300]  know and so we absolutely must retain control and and an emergency like this speak directly to the
[1:36:33.300 --> 1:36:38.020]  people and all this is wired in to take over everything and when they bitch about it he goes
[1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:42.820]  it was already there you were already using it he just doesn't know that he's sitting there with all
[1:36:42.820 --> 1:36:51.060]  the weapons he needs to save the country mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you
[1:36:51.060 --> 1:36:55.620]  doing alex man i'm just working as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you

[1:37:06.660 --> 1:37:15.060]  quercetin which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ionophore
[1:37:15.060 --> 1:37:21.380]  similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to
[1:37:21.380 --> 1:37:28.260]  take a look at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products
[1:37:28.260 --> 1:37:32.100]  that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctors sell them
[1:37:32.100 --> 1:37:35.700]  like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them
[1:37:35.700 --> 1:37:40.820]  like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what
[1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:50.980]  produced this so thanks thanks for the plug anybody listening to my voice simply search
[1:37:50.980 --> 1:37:58.660]  in the term davos group technocracy we're technocrats you will get claus schwaab and

[1:40:48.740 --> 1:40:54.740]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:06.820 --> 1:41:11.380]  welcome back it's the alex jones show ivan rakeland is a former green beret commander
[1:41:11.380 --> 1:41:18.500]  patriot defense intelligence agency lawyer you name it and now he has been routinely fighting super
[1:41:18.500 --> 1:41:23.780]  hardcore with legal strategies and plans the president retweeted uh some of his work uh
[1:41:23.780 --> 1:41:29.860]  recently when he was talking about getting pints to uh not uh certify the electors now that's a huge
[1:41:29.860 --> 1:41:35.060]  issue lawsuits are filed by congressman louis gomer and the amistad a group of others so
[1:41:35.060 --> 1:41:39.700]  what he's saying is front and center so let's show his twitter for all the tv listeners all the tv
[1:41:39.700 --> 1:41:45.140]  viewers radio listeners you're the real emergency alert system of the president go there and get
[1:41:45.140 --> 1:41:52.980]  his latest tweet talking about how trump needs to trigger the emergency alert system and send that
[1:41:54.500 --> 1:41:58.980]  to the president's twitter and adan juniors we know that they're reading what mr rakeland says
[1:41:58.980 --> 1:42:02.900]  we know that general flin is talking to the president we know that others are and this
[1:42:02.900 --> 1:42:08.980]  sounds wild why activate the emergency system well when trump underlings were putting out
[1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:14.660]  basic presidential alerts two years ago the new york times and others said presidential alert goes
[1:42:14.660 --> 1:42:20.260]  to millions of cell phones across the u.s others asked is it okay should it be able to do that well
[1:42:20.260 --> 1:42:25.940]  now the who is in control of it the bureaucracy is and the president since then when they tested
[1:42:25.940 --> 1:42:32.580]  it two years ago it's never been used since no one explain this again under the law when you are on
[1:42:32.580 --> 1:42:36.420]  twitter or facebook you see that same blue message when it knows you're talking about
[1:42:36.420 --> 1:42:42.580]  covid or you're talking about the election or other key things it overrides it and says no you're
[1:42:42.580 --> 1:42:47.540]  going to look at this so it's already implemented what what ivan's saying is the rightful president
[1:42:47.540 --> 1:42:53.300]  should be using it right now and so this is really the secret weapon ivan you're absolutely right
[1:42:53.300 --> 1:42:57.380]  what made you think of this and and and you've got the floor to break down more what needs to happen
[1:42:58.900 --> 1:43:02.180]  yeah so a couple components the last one first and then we'll go into legal components so the
[1:43:02.180 --> 1:43:06.980]  first one is absolutely the president is the president regardless of how this election results
[1:43:07.540 --> 1:43:12.580]  uh j until january 20th at noon the president of the united states the commander in chief is
[1:43:12.580 --> 1:43:17.540]  donald j trump so he has full discretion and authority to use all legal powers under the
[1:43:17.540 --> 1:43:22.660]  constitution and all the laws underneath that to implement one of those is activating this
[1:43:22.660 --> 1:43:28.820]  emergency he is there primarily to defend the united states from our foreign adversaries right
[1:43:28.820 --> 1:43:33.780]  and as part of that we're being attacked so he needs to activate the emergency alert system
[1:43:33.780 --> 1:43:38.820]  incorporated and you know it's already been alerted since 1951 and they turned it on he has
[1:43:38.820 --> 1:43:42.420]  the right to already use it when with these foreign cyber attacks were already in the emergency
[1:43:43.460 --> 1:43:49.460]  we're in the emergency now he just hasn't implemented yet that's up to him to decide to do so
[1:43:49.460 --> 1:43:54.660]  now the second component we're talking about the the legal aspect of it so great case followed by
[1:43:54.660 --> 1:44:00.260]  louis gomert if you go back to december 23rd when uh the president retweeted the argument that
[1:44:00.820 --> 1:44:06.740]  when the vice if the vice president received those electors from the states that are in
[1:44:06.740 --> 1:44:12.660]  contest the six states and then potentially seven with new mexico he by not denying it
[1:44:13.300 --> 1:44:18.100]  accepted those slates of electors because in the us code title three of the us code section
[1:44:18.100 --> 1:44:24.020]  um i can't recall right now i think it's in 15 or an earlier section says that on this on the fourth
[1:44:24.020 --> 1:44:31.060]  wednesday of december it's incumbent upon the vice president to send a message to the secretaries
[1:44:31.060 --> 1:44:39.140]  of state of states that did not send a legitimate legal slate of electors so he had the opportunity
[1:44:39.140 --> 1:44:45.060]  to use what's known as the pence card you know version a or the first one and by doing so that
[1:44:45.060 --> 1:44:50.900]  launched a couple lawsuits that became ripe against him so amistad filed the lawsuit the day prior
[1:44:50.900 --> 1:44:56.020]  but it wasn't ripe in my opinion uh based on my legal analysis until the vice president
[1:44:56.020 --> 1:45:02.180]  refused to do anything on the 23rd so then on the 24th new year's eve is when that lawsuit
[1:45:02.180 --> 1:45:09.060]  became uh ripe and he is now a defendant in that case and that's essentially saying that he was
[1:45:09.060 --> 1:45:15.140]  complicit in violating the constitution because the states violated the constitution's article
[1:45:15.140 --> 1:45:21.060]  two section one clause two by not running their election according to how the legislature there
[1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:27.460]  of of that state wanted to run it and additionally they violated the 14th amendment of all the folks
[1:45:27.460 --> 1:45:33.700]  that uh voted legally by allowing all these fraudulent votes to be counted as part of the uh
[1:45:33.700 --> 1:45:38.340]  the bottom line and it's at the precedent it set the precedent they're now saying in georgia
[1:45:38.340 --> 1:45:42.420]  they're gonna just keep doing it forever now so so by the supreme court not acting by pence not
[1:45:42.420 --> 1:45:50.900]  acting they're just they're just bullying ahead with this takeover right so now you have a lawsuit
[1:45:50.900 --> 1:45:57.140]  by louis gomer in addition to that previous lawsuit that talks about he is arguing that title
[1:45:57.140 --> 1:46:03.940]  three of the us code sections five and fifteen are in violation of the 12th amendment let me
[1:46:03.940 --> 1:46:11.300]  break that down real quick so the 12th amendment articulates on how a president is selected in the
[1:46:11.300 --> 1:46:17.140]  joint session of congress and it's done in a manner where if no if no one gets 200 in this
[1:46:17.140 --> 1:46:23.300]  case 270 a majority of electors that are selected by the states and transmitted to the congress
[1:46:23.860 --> 1:46:29.060]  then you go to what's known as a contingent vote so let's assume that either the states pull back
[1:46:29.060 --> 1:46:32.740]  on their electors and that there's different variations to this it's a little more nuanced
[1:46:32.740 --> 1:46:38.180]  that we can cover in the next five minutes but if there's a if no one gets a majority
[1:46:38.180 --> 1:46:45.940]  then louis gomer is arguing that it has to go to a contingent style election in the house meaning
[1:46:45.940 --> 1:46:52.900]  one state one vote and under that construct republicans have the majority at least 26 states as
[1:46:52.900 --> 1:46:58.420]  it currently stands there's still some contests going on in different states that may keep it at
[1:46:58.420 --> 1:47:04.500]  26 or bring it up to 20 states either way the republicans have the majority in the 117 congress
[1:47:04.500 --> 1:47:13.060]  that sworn in at noon on the third so title three says if there is a contest it goes to what the
[1:47:13.060 --> 1:47:19.540]  governor certifies under i think it's title three usc section five so the tide break if you will
[1:47:19.540 --> 1:47:26.180]  if there's an objection that's made between the senate and the house for these electors and the
[1:47:26.180 --> 1:47:31.220]  senate rules that they're gonna decline those states electors and the house rules that they're
[1:47:31.220 --> 1:47:35.780]  gonna accept them meaning the biden ones coming from these six states who deals with that tie
[1:47:35.780 --> 1:47:40.500]  break of the two houses not agreeing whether to accept or reject those electoral slate that
[1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:48.020]  electoral slate title three says it goes to the governor's certification gomer saying that that
[1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:53.220]  is unconstitutional to the 12th amendment the fifth due process causing a couple other things
[1:47:53.220 --> 1:47:57.220]  because that takes us back to the governor's agreeing to the fake mail-in ballots with the
[1:47:57.220 --> 1:48:04.100]  democrats in the consent forms and we're right back again the legislature being cut out right
[1:48:04.100 --> 1:48:09.860]  so that is a great and brilliant argument the two things i'll say my argument that i put out
[1:48:09.860 --> 1:48:15.860]  on the 23rd was that and i've subsequently created a four page memo with analysis of these
[1:48:15.860 --> 1:48:20.980]  particular sections and the 12th amendment is that the vice president in his power as the
[1:48:20.980 --> 1:48:26.500]  presiding officer can at that point say you know what since there's a conflict in the house and the
[1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:31.780]  senate on objecting to these electoral slates i decide that the tie break is going to go to the
[1:48:31.780 --> 1:48:37.620]  house under the 12th amendments one state one vote rule and after that vote assuming everyone
[1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:43.700]  votes on party line they come in agreement and they agree to reject these states electors bringing
[1:48:44.420 --> 1:48:50.420]  everyone below 270 threshold and then triggering the seventh if you will if you if they only reject
[1:48:50.420 --> 1:48:57.300]  six of these states then the seventh overarching vote to determine who the president is we'll go
[1:48:57.300 --> 1:49:02.260]  to the 12th amendment one state one vote ruling all right i'm gonna stay right here do five more
[1:49:02.260 --> 1:49:08.980]  minutes with us because you've got the memos they're on your twitter account rakelin at rakelin r a i k l i n
[1:49:10.420 --> 1:49:14.580]  everybody needs to retweet it the president we need to write an article about it your abs we need
[1:49:14.580 --> 1:49:18.660]  to take this interview where we explain what eas is because the lefts can act like this is totally
[1:49:18.660 --> 1:49:23.460]  insane a martial law no they have illegally you sir yeah they're using it other than the national
[1:49:23.460 --> 1:49:28.740]  address which you know biden's gonna end up using the and the president has this power people think
[1:49:28.740 --> 1:49:34.340]  it's abuse they try to impeach him he has the power he needs to use it uh biden is a chi-com agent
[1:49:34.340 --> 1:49:39.460]  there is no other way it is now time to do it back in just about two minutes with ivan rakelin
[1:49:39.460 --> 1:49:44.980]  and we'll talk about what else the president could do because biden clearly stole this okay but it's
[1:49:44.980 --> 1:49:52.420]  worse than that but it's worse than that because he's a chi-com agent so it doesn't matter one
[1:49:52.420 --> 1:49:57.220]  way or the other this is a takeover and they're planning another lockdown this is totally insane
[1:49:57.220 --> 1:50:02.740]  now briefly we're funded by lister's support we bring you great products so that you want to

[1:53:16.500 --> 1:53:22.340]  telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human
[1:53:22.340 --> 1:53:27.860]  infrastructure the infrastructure that's left under 5g has been a controlled robot autonomous cars
[1:53:27.860 --> 1:53:32.660]  and trucks this is all they're admitted plan the public's finally listening because the plan
[1:53:32.660 --> 1:53:37.460]  is no longer in beta it's gone operational it's a post-human future you better find out about it right
[1:53:37.460 --> 1:53:58.740]  now you're listening to the alex jones show one of the good parts about trump was he was an outsider
[1:53:58.740 --> 1:54:04.340]  never better than government but because he didn't understand government had been studying it he got
[1:54:04.340 --> 1:54:09.860]  overrun he got blocked in many cases but he still has the executive power that he used on the economy
[1:54:09.860 --> 1:54:13.860]  and other areas to stop this and to address the american people from the resolute desk
[1:54:15.060 --> 1:54:20.100]  and i agree he should use the eas system to direct people to his address it's what it's set up for
[1:54:20.100 --> 1:54:26.500]  an america if it wasn't in a crisis this big i'd say don't do it but the globalists are in control
[1:54:26.500 --> 1:54:32.580]  they're already using the eas system ivan rakeland in closing other points you'd like to make about
[1:54:32.580 --> 1:54:38.740]  the situation and what else we can do to try to stop this foreign takeover yes i don't know maybe
[1:54:38.740 --> 1:54:44.420]  hashtag on the airwaves but in that regard other than talking about the foreign threat as i mentioned
[1:54:44.420 --> 1:54:48.740]  in that spreadsheet he he needs to incorporate everything that's been put out from all the
[1:54:48.740 --> 1:54:55.380]  states hearings all the i think peter navarro just updated his immaculate deception that needs
[1:54:55.380 --> 1:55:00.980]  to be put out for the country writ large i mean you and i know about the immaculate deception
[1:55:00.980 --> 1:55:05.700]  all the fraud that's been going on but i would say 60 if not more percent of the country
[1:55:05.700 --> 1:55:11.700]  does not know that the fraud exists because it's been uh it's it it's been ignored by your mainstream
[1:55:11.700 --> 1:55:17.540]  media and it's been censored on big tech so he needs to use that day by day at 9 p.m for an hour
[1:55:17.540 --> 1:55:22.820]  bringing his entire staff rudy juliani can come in and say you know what this these are all the
[1:55:22.820 --> 1:55:27.780]  legal actions that are occurring with the fraud in each one of these states and because the supreme
[1:55:27.780 --> 1:55:32.740]  court will not hear us we're going to make the case to america of all of the different fraud
[1:55:32.740 --> 1:55:38.820]  that's going on and then weave it into all of the foreign influence and interference that created
[1:55:38.820 --> 1:55:45.540]  this entire just mess and fiasco and then the last thing i'll say is uh advice to vice president
[1:55:45.540 --> 1:55:52.020]  pence the with the two cases that have been filed over the last week against you and i i'd guess
[1:55:52.020 --> 1:55:57.060]  that there's going to be more but my recommendation to vice president pence is in his response to
[1:55:57.060 --> 1:56:04.740]  these lawsuits he needs to say you know what louis gohmert i agree with your analysis i did i i i
[1:56:04.740 --> 1:56:10.420]  cannot you need to enjoin me from accepting these electoral slates on january 6th and that would be
[1:56:10.420 --> 1:56:15.460]  essentially responding to his lawsuit and the judge will look at one side and say oh louis
[1:56:15.460 --> 1:56:20.260]  gohmert is arguing this along with kelly ward and then the rest of the states and the vice president
[1:56:20.260 --> 1:56:24.820]  agrees with it the judge really has no option other than to say absolutely i'm going to go ahead
[1:56:24.820 --> 1:56:29.620]  and enjoin the vice president from accepting these electoral slates and what happens next
[1:56:30.180 --> 1:56:36.340]  the left then appeals it it goes to the court of appeals then it goes from there whoever loses
[1:56:36.340 --> 1:56:41.620]  ends up appealing it's in supreme court and i think at that point when it appears as though
[1:56:42.180 --> 1:56:49.860]  vice president pence is mandated to reject based on a court ruling the electoral slates from these
[1:56:49.860 --> 1:56:54.340]  six fraudulent states that also violated the constitution and multiple components of it
[1:56:54.340 --> 1:56:59.620]  article two as well as the 12th amendment uh he he's going to be forced to reject it saying i can't
[1:56:59.620 --> 1:57:04.900]  i can't accept these and then the supreme court i think may at that point in time get involved
[1:57:04.900 --> 1:57:10.420]  but for them to do it over the course of the next eight days highly unlikely and so if that
[1:57:10.420 --> 1:57:17.620]  district judge over the next couple days takes the case and pence does what i recommend uh he's
[1:57:17.620 --> 1:57:22.420]  going to be bound by the court by the law to reject those six slates in closing what else
[1:57:22.420 --> 1:57:26.020]  could the president do i mean he needs to not just give a speech here a speech there he needs to
[1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:31.860]  start addressing the public from the resolute desk now and mobilize the public to come to the
[1:57:31.860 --> 1:57:38.020]  january six rally that he's reportedly a little bird absolutely so there's the executive approach
[1:57:38.020 --> 1:57:42.660]  and then the legislative approach that i talk about in that four page memo and in order for us to
[1:57:43.620 --> 1:57:48.740]  uh facilitate and assist the legislature the united states congress to make the proper
[1:57:48.740 --> 1:57:54.660]  constitutional decision it's going to be quite influential for two million of us minimum to arrive
[1:57:54.660 --> 1:58:00.100]  in washington dc and be right outside of the congress congressional halls as they cast their
[1:58:00.100 --> 1:58:06.420]  votes whether or not to accept those legislative slates i'll say one last thing go to my twitter
[1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:11.300]  dm me if you're look if you want to come to dc just can't afford it i'm going to go ahead and
[1:58:11.300 --> 1:58:16.580]  open up my backyard for if anybody wants to come out and uh with the tent and some sleeping bags
[1:58:16.580 --> 1:58:20.580]  and i'm probably going to open it up for another 10 people if that if you guys are okay with that
[1:58:20.580 --> 1:58:24.580]  i'd be more yeah that's key we need patriots to go online and fight their family and buy people
[1:58:24.580 --> 1:58:28.980]  into your homes this is a total mobilization for america we need 10 million the hotels are going
[1:58:28.980 --> 1:58:34.260]  to be closed that's right the hotels are saying they're closing to keep us out aren't they yep so
[1:58:34.260 --> 1:58:39.060]  everybody invite as many people as you can i've already committed to 13 people that's right they're

[1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:54.500]  fight for trump on january 6th in washington dc our fight to drain the washington swamp and we

[1:59:16.340 --> 1:59:22.260]  is able to get in there he will put america under permanent lockdown siege until we're brought to
[1:59:22.260 --> 1:59:29.300]  our knees hundreds of thousands returned to dc in december we will never give up we will never

[1:59:43.380 --> 2:00:00.020]  we will never ever surrender

[2:00:16.580 --> 2:00:22.980]  we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of the resistance
[2:00:22.980 --> 2:00:32.980]  you're listening to alex joe we've watched the last burned down apartment buildings and police
[2:00:32.980 --> 2:00:38.420]  stations and shoot innocent people in the head on the side of the road and we've watched the media
[2:00:38.420 --> 2:00:44.660]  tell us that it's mostly peaceful demonstrations and then we saw kyle rittenhouse who become a symbol
[2:00:45.300 --> 2:00:50.420]  of good people defending themselves out there trying to be a medic trying to help people
[2:00:50.420 --> 2:00:59.620]  in kenosha wisconsin being chased down by thugs with guns and defending himself and now having
[2:00:59.620 --> 2:01:06.340]  the book thrown at him and now he tries to raise money they go and take away the merchant accounts
[2:01:06.340 --> 2:01:11.940]  they go out for the bank accounts i've gone through this as well this is the true persecution
[2:01:12.580 --> 2:01:17.140]  and the left also goes after his lawyer the left goes after trump's lawyers the left goes after
[2:01:17.140 --> 2:01:21.860]  my lawyers and says you don't even have a right to representation when they try to put you in
[2:01:21.860 --> 2:01:27.140]  jail or they sue you so we're joined by john pierce rittenhouse's great lawyer that's on a
[2:01:27.140 --> 2:01:35.780]  wonderful job free kyle usa dot com and wendy rittenhouse his mother uh they've added a seventh
[2:01:35.780 --> 2:01:42.580]  charge against kyle we've got a lot of breaking news but we are all kyle rittenhouse ladies and
[2:01:42.580 --> 2:01:49.780]  gentlemen because they put the george soros dea's or da's in and and put in the state attorney generals
[2:01:49.780 --> 2:01:57.460]  all over the country there is a rain of terror against even 85 year old women that shoot people
[2:01:57.460 --> 2:02:01.860]  with weapons in their own homes in some leftist areas i mean this is just like the uk now
[2:02:02.420 --> 2:02:07.940]  where if someone steals your rv you're not allowed to have it back because it's quote their culture
[2:02:07.940 --> 2:02:15.140]  to do it if they're a you know pikey or a or an irish gypsy this is so out of control this is the
[2:02:15.140 --> 2:02:21.300]  system protecting criminals so i'll stop ranting and introduce uh john pierce here and wendy rittenhouse
[2:02:21.300 --> 2:02:24.900]  and john you can probably introduce this and bring wendy in but i watched the interview

[2:02:28.020 --> 2:02:33.060]  developments but also what it's like for this mother to watch her son go through this but i

[2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:48.260]  did yourself it's just really unbelievable what's happening in the country generally it's unbelievable
[2:02:48.260 --> 2:02:54.660]  what has happened to kyle as you mentioned after four months apparently they decided
[2:02:54.660 --> 2:03:00.180]  just the other day the prosecutors to add a seventh charge for violating curfew i'd be interested to
[2:03:00.180 --> 2:03:05.540]  see how many other you know folks you know had been charged with violating curfew over the last
[2:03:05.540 --> 2:03:09.940]  you know eight months as city you know american city after american city has been burned down
[2:03:10.500 --> 2:03:15.380]  where are the charges for those who attempted to murder kyle rittenhouse where are the charges
[2:03:15.380 --> 2:03:20.580]  for those you know who've committed arson in city after city after city where are the charges against
[2:03:20.580 --> 2:03:27.540]  the mayors and the governors who have blatantly failed to perform their most fundamental uh you
[2:03:27.540 --> 2:03:32.980]  know governmental duty of providing a basic degree of law and order um you know this is
[2:03:32.980 --> 2:03:38.580]  got to be the most important case in the history of self-defense in the anglo-american legal system
[2:03:38.580 --> 2:03:43.380]  perhaps the boston massacre comes close and we are fighting this through the very end alex uh
[2:03:43.380 --> 2:03:47.220]  and we will win it doesn't matter how many death threats they throw away it doesn't matter how much
[2:03:47.220 --> 2:03:54.100]  character assassination we face we are going to win and what's incredible is it's mobs of convicted
[2:03:54.100 --> 2:03:59.380]  pedophiles and wife beaters and armed robbers and you start looking at the backgrounds of of
[2:03:59.380 --> 2:04:05.620]  a bunch of these people this was a mob of really nasty dangerous people chasing him down shooting
[2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:13.140]  at him we now know but but but i guess all that's okay wow but i want to talk to kyle's mom here
[2:04:13.140 --> 2:04:17.860]  i mean it's surreal being a parent and and and imagining my son in that position but
[2:04:17.860 --> 2:04:21.860]  wendy what's what's what's first and foremost for you that you want to relate a couple million
[2:04:21.860 --> 2:04:29.380]  viewers right now i want to thank them for all their support they've done giving to my family and
[2:04:29.380 --> 2:04:36.580]  even the people overseas um kyle got mail from them and i want to thank them also and if it wasn't
[2:04:36.580 --> 2:04:42.340]  from them i wouldn't know what to do and we need their we need their help we need more help alex
[2:04:42.340 --> 2:04:47.940]  we need everyone to go to free kyle usa.com uh you know kyle was subjected to an outrageous
[2:04:47.940 --> 2:04:53.140]  excessive unconstitutional two million dollar cash bail amount we raised those 10 million dollars we
[2:04:53.140 --> 2:04:57.700]  put the cash on the barrel head we got him free we set him free he's he's with his family but we
[2:04:57.700 --> 2:05:03.860]  need a lot more resources but this is going to be a long hard fight every american every democrat
[2:05:03.860 --> 2:05:07.940]  republican independent should care about this because they're coming after cow written house now
[2:05:07.940 --> 2:05:13.780]  and they're gonna come after you next let's be clear about that they pick people like written house
[2:05:13.780 --> 2:05:17.940]  like stone like jones like trump because i've experienced it i'm not being a victim here it's
[2:05:17.940 --> 2:05:22.100]  just true and then we become like a standard like the flag that they want to get and then
[2:05:22.100 --> 2:05:27.460]  they throw everything they've got at you the harassment the lawsuits the lies and again just
[2:05:27.460 --> 2:05:32.180]  describe what what it's like uh mrs written house like what you've gone through what you
[2:05:32.180 --> 2:05:36.580]  witness has just been a new experience for you to really find out what the left's really like
[2:05:36.580 --> 2:05:50.020]  like yeah i mean the left is disgusting unreal and you have to be a criminal for them to put you
[2:05:50.020 --> 2:06:02.980]  on a pedestal my son he's a caring young man and they utilize him then he's a monster a killer
[2:06:02.980 --> 2:06:13.540]  a murderer you know it's it's just upon i'm just so disgusted with it you know they need to be stopped
[2:06:17.300 --> 2:06:21.540]  i wonder i mean obviously they're gonna twist anything kyle says but i wonder why we haven't
[2:06:21.540 --> 2:06:28.180]  really seen any video messages from your son yet yeah so so so alex you know we need to be
[2:06:28.180 --> 2:06:33.060]  obviously very careful about uh you know statements uh you know from kyle in light of the current
[2:06:33.060 --> 2:06:40.100]  criminal proceedings we have amazing uh you have very experienced criminal defense uh attorneys
[2:06:40.100 --> 2:06:46.420]  lawyers in wisconsin uh from kenosha and resane um and you know we are focused like a laser beam
[2:06:46.420 --> 2:06:53.060]  on the uh you know on on getting kyle acquitted i i will say though um that this goes much deeper
[2:06:53.060 --> 2:06:58.580]  than kyle uh there are some really really dangerous things happening uh in this country
[2:06:58.580 --> 2:07:05.540]  cows obviously become like you said a target and a symbol uh for for the left and uh you know we we
[2:07:05.540 --> 2:07:09.700]  need to uh save the second amendment we need to save the right uh to self-defense and that's
[2:07:09.700 --> 2:07:14.820]  going to come through acquitting kyle but you know kyle and wendy care deeply about this country
[2:07:14.820 --> 2:07:21.460]  the whole that whole family cares deeply about this country um and so you know this is very important
[2:07:21.460 --> 2:07:25.860]  for every american well that was my next question for wendy uh i mean because obviously your son's
[2:07:25.860 --> 2:07:30.660]  out there cleaning up graffiti he's out being a medic he sees the police standing down days of
[2:07:30.660 --> 2:07:35.780]  burning he goes there they viciously attacking for no reason they try to kill him he defends himself
[2:07:35.780 --> 2:07:40.260]  he kindly only blows the guy's arm off instead of actually shooting him in the chest and i mean
[2:07:40.260 --> 2:07:44.660]  all of this is going on how did you raise such a good man and tell us about your son and and you
[2:07:44.660 --> 2:07:53.700]  know why he why he went out there he went out there to help he saw canosha burning down law enforcement
[2:07:53.700 --> 2:08:00.660]  had to stand by because the governor and the mayor canosha didn't do nothing about it um the
[2:08:01.620 --> 2:08:07.380]  president trump offered the national guard they shot it down they only had a couple national
[2:08:07.380 --> 2:08:14.900]  guard and kyle his sister dominant black and a couple other kids went out there to clean i couldn't
[2:08:14.900 --> 2:08:23.460]  be prouder of my children to clean up clean up the city and everything and i'm proud of kyle
[2:08:24.100 --> 2:08:30.260]  and he's he's a wonderful young man i'm proud to say he's my son and i love my son i love my
[2:08:30.260 --> 2:08:38.020]  daughters i couldn't be prouder of him well we are all kyle written house now because he's a good
[2:08:38.020 --> 2:08:42.420]  person with a good record who went out there with a firing extinguisher who was trying to put out
[2:08:43.060 --> 2:08:47.700]  garbage and i mean the video shows this talking to your lawyer john pierce i mean john he's on
[2:08:47.700 --> 2:08:52.100]  video trying to put out a dumpster fire and they're burning up cars and then a convicted pedophile
[2:08:52.100 --> 2:08:57.780]  attacks him i mean that's what happened here yeah alex if this is not self-defense for kyle written
[2:08:57.780 --> 2:09:03.060]  house uh there there is no right to self-defense this is a watershed moment in american history
[2:09:03.060 --> 2:09:08.020]  uh you know the right to self-defense as you well know uh is the most sacred foundational
[2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:13.700]  basic uh individual liberty we have uh it's obviously enshrined in the second amendment to the constitution
[2:09:13.700 --> 2:09:17.780]  but it does not come from a piece of paper does not come from our government does not come from
[2:09:17.780 --> 2:09:23.780]  mayor's governor's president it comes from god uh and it cannot and will not be taken away from
[2:09:23.780 --> 2:09:28.660]  any process by prosecutors uh in kenosha that's right this is a total soros agenda we're gonna
[2:09:28.660 --> 2:09:31.940]  come back in a few minutes go right back to you to break down more and talk about the support
[2:09:31.940 --> 2:09:36.340]  you guys free kyle usa dot com we are all kyle written house and if your team of you or you're
[2:09:36.340 --> 2:09:42.100]  seeing it the slow motion footage of them chasing him with guns drawn and and him defending himself
[2:09:42.100 --> 2:09:48.020]  if that isn't self-defense there is no self-defense three two one here we go it's back in stock it's

[2:10:44.980 --> 2:10:50.500]  mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex man i'm just working as far
[2:10:50.500 --> 2:10:55.300]  as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love you man i want to make a quick
[2:10:55.300 --> 2:11:01.140]  plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went looked at the
[2:11:01.140 --> 2:11:07.380]  ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains quercetin which according to some
[2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:14.420]  published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine
[2:11:14.980 --> 2:11:19.460]  and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look at that
[2:11:19.460 --> 2:11:26.820]  but all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell
[2:11:26.820 --> 2:11:30.740]  through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[2:11:30.740 --> 2:11:33.860]  because there's a lot of expensive product in them it's really only cost them like 50 bucks
[2:11:33.860 --> 2:11:38.820]  and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so
[2:11:38.820 --> 2:11:50.420]  thanks thanks for the plug you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:11:56.340 --> 2:12:06.020]  i've got a tiger by the tail that's plain to see i won't be much when you get through with me

[2:12:17.860 --> 2:12:24.420]  and you know this is a nightmare situation my son six months ago was in a convenience store
[2:12:24.420 --> 2:12:30.900]  like ten o'clock at nine he's he's 18 now he wasn't 18 yet and a literal crack in crazy person
[2:12:30.900 --> 2:12:34.340]  came in we've shown the surveillance footage sort of attacking everybody hitting everybody
[2:12:34.340 --> 2:12:39.780]  so my son punched him pretty hard a couple times knocked him down the guy ran out cops showed up
[2:12:40.580 --> 2:12:44.500]  and the guy said i'm a black lives matter i'm protesting so the cops let the guy that was
[2:12:44.500 --> 2:12:49.380]  attacking everybody go and it's very very sad and and so that's really what we've reached here

[2:15:13.780 --> 2:15:19.060]  and uh you know alex i'd like to touch on the uh the black lives matter theme that
[2:15:19.060 --> 2:15:23.140]  you mentioned um you know the connections of folks like george soros because this is
[2:15:23.140 --> 2:15:28.580]  this is a real uh issue and i'm not sure if your viewers know this um but the the district attorney
[2:15:28.580 --> 2:15:35.860]  in kenosha wisconsin uh michael gravely uh was in a six week uh extremely friendly
[2:15:36.420 --> 2:15:41.860]  personal texting uh relationship with one of the main black lives matter agitators
[2:15:41.860 --> 2:15:47.220]  in kenosha this texting relationship which included breakfast dates um in all manner of
[2:15:47.220 --> 2:15:55.940]  coordination occurred from the time span before during and after uh kenosha was burning down uh
[2:15:55.940 --> 2:16:02.020]  and included you know references uh by the black lives matter activists uh you know that the city
[2:16:02.980 --> 2:16:07.300]  you know was going to be was going to be burning and people were going to be coming in and uh things
[2:16:07.300 --> 2:16:13.860]  were not going to be good um and so you know low and behold um uh you know the rioters isolated
[2:16:13.860 --> 2:16:20.180]  their target uh they tried to kill him uh they didn't count on him defending himself as effectively
[2:16:20.180 --> 2:16:25.300]  uh and with as much restraint as he did and so you know now they have their uh you know
[2:16:25.300 --> 2:16:30.420]  sacrificial lamb that they're gonna try to go after it's right think about what the left's saying
[2:16:30.420 --> 2:16:35.540]  we're gonna organize we're gonna come to cities randomly burn things down we're gonna attack and
[2:16:35.540 --> 2:16:40.900]  kill people and the police are gonna stand down and if you defend yourself you're a criminal
[2:16:40.900 --> 2:16:44.900]  we're gonna throw the book at you this is terrorism this is them sending the message have you seen
[2:16:44.900 --> 2:16:49.140]  the videos where people come and are trying to attack a guy's house and he goes look i have a
[2:16:49.140 --> 2:16:55.220]  biden sign in my yard and they still keep attacking i mean the the left is trying to conjure
[2:16:55.220 --> 2:16:59.460]  a giant mob of criminals and most these folks aren't even black they're doing it in the name
[2:16:59.460 --> 2:17:04.420]  of black people so a bunch of convicted pedophiles and rapists uh literally can run around burning
[2:17:04.420 --> 2:17:11.060]  and looting this is just so sick this is yes it absolutely is and this is a as you're pointing
[2:17:11.060 --> 2:17:15.620]  out very effectively right now in a way that not too many people have this is a concerted effort
[2:17:15.620 --> 2:17:21.860]  this is a plan um uh you know i think about the viciousness of some of these folks you know we
[2:17:21.860 --> 2:17:27.780]  i i was in downtown canosha shortly after this happened there are there are houses multi-floor
[2:17:27.780 --> 2:17:33.780]  houses and apartments on that street shared an avenue uh that had children in the top floors
[2:17:33.780 --> 2:17:39.220]  that had disabled people on the top floors and those houses you know felt the need to spray paint
[2:17:39.220 --> 2:17:43.140]  on the outside of the houses that there were children and disabled people on the top floor
[2:17:43.140 --> 2:17:48.660]  please don't burn the house down because those people will be burned alive uh and you think that
[2:17:48.660 --> 2:17:53.620]  you know that that had any impact or or or or stopped these folks oh it's hard for me to watch
[2:17:53.620 --> 2:17:58.340]  not just there but the videos out of oregon and and seattle where they march into middle class
[2:17:58.340 --> 2:18:02.820]  neighborhoods and say we're gonna burn your house down you see little kids looking out the window
[2:18:02.820 --> 2:18:10.180]  i mean this is so villainous yeah it absolutely is and i tell you it's it's it's gotta stop it's
[2:18:10.180 --> 2:18:15.700]  gotta stop now uh and it's gonna stop and i will say that uh you know we we saw you out there uh
[2:18:15.700 --> 2:18:20.980]  you know watching in in one of those recent rallies in dc and and god bless you for it and uh
[2:18:20.980 --> 2:18:26.260]  you know if if by chance uh this pretender go by and gets inaugurated um you know in a few weeks
[2:18:26.260 --> 2:18:30.900]  i think one of the positive things that's gonna come out of it is there you know their tactics
[2:18:30.900 --> 2:18:36.020]  have been exposed there is going to be a rage and an energy which which i know you you have tapped
[2:18:36.020 --> 2:18:42.820]  into and and you're a real leader on that front um but uh i tell you what regular americans are slow
[2:18:42.820 --> 2:18:48.660]  to anger uh but when that arsenal democracy uh gets fired up um it's not good for the other you use
[2:18:48.660 --> 2:18:53.780]  the perfect word he's a pretender and the whole media saying he's the president elect with despite
[2:18:53.780 --> 2:18:58.580]  the evidence is a giant sigh up against us all it's just insane it's like it's like everything
[2:18:58.580 --> 2:19:04.100]  they do it's just total lies yeah that's right and and you know again as you know and as you've
[2:19:04.100 --> 2:19:08.820]  talked about there has been a long march uh through the institutions over the past uh a few decades
[2:19:08.820 --> 2:19:14.260]  it's very similar to the malice revolution um in china and the chinese communist party uh their
[2:19:14.260 --> 2:19:18.660]  tactics are very clear they attempt to destroy everything sacred in a society they attempt
[2:19:18.660 --> 2:19:24.980]  to they tear down statues they try to destroy history they try to destroy our faith in god
[2:19:24.980 --> 2:19:31.300]  and they try to capture the key uh cultural elite institutions such as the media such as academia
[2:19:31.300 --> 2:19:37.620]  such as you know the the financial institutions and and today such as big tech um and and they've
[2:19:37.620 --> 2:19:42.180]  been they've been pretty successful on that front but i'll tell you americans are waking up now um
[2:19:42.180 --> 2:19:45.940]  and we're going to fight back and it's not going to be pretty uh for those who are attempting to
[2:19:45.940 --> 2:19:51.380]  take our freedom well all i can say is amen to that we got one more segment with you guys coming

[2:26:15.940 --> 2:26:21.700]  from folks at free call usa.com other points that need to be made uh what has the response
[2:26:21.700 --> 2:26:27.060]  been like wendy overall by neighbors by his peers what was it like for him in jail people really you
[2:26:27.060 --> 2:26:32.340]  know admire him for uh you know the great job he did that night trying to put out fires and trying
[2:26:32.340 --> 2:26:37.300]  to clean and trying to help people that were hurt and and you know he had a lot of restraint a lot
[2:26:37.300 --> 2:26:41.620]  of folks might have ended up you know in the heat of battle a lot of cops would have probably shot
[2:26:41.620 --> 2:26:46.180]  somebody innocent you know just in the whole melee but he just really acted with a lot of uh
[2:26:46.180 --> 2:26:50.500]  control and precision and so we say he didn't just do anything wrong he went out there and
[2:26:50.500 --> 2:26:55.940]  tried to stop a bunch of criminals in my view so i so i do think what he did is heroic uh in a time
[2:26:55.940 --> 2:27:00.420]  when the police aren't allowed to do their job and the and the politicians are openly evil i mean
[2:27:00.420 --> 2:27:05.860]  i think that what he did is a heroic act but but just separately what are other points you'd like
[2:27:05.860 --> 2:27:11.860]  to make about the response you've gotten about what this experience has been like um this experience
[2:27:11.860 --> 2:27:21.380]  is so overwhelming you know he's my 17 year old son you know and when i read the comments and tell
[2:27:21.380 --> 2:27:27.380]  people tell me he's a hero and he didn't do nothing wrong you know a lot of women say that he
[2:27:27.380 --> 2:27:36.420]  self depends and everybody that wrote me through emails through twitter um with the wonderful
[2:27:36.420 --> 2:27:43.860]  comments that these said about my son he's my son you know i couldn't be power of him you know
[2:27:44.980 --> 2:27:51.060]  and when i do read the negative comments they need to watch the videos over and over again
[2:27:51.060 --> 2:27:58.500]  11 11 minutes of truth they need to go on the website and watch it and picking up off of that
[2:27:58.500 --> 2:28:04.100]  just a little bit alexia but think about the restraint that this 17 year old kid showed
[2:28:04.900 --> 2:28:10.580]  in a war zone i mean you've seen these videos it looked like it looked like mogadishu and and
[2:28:10.580 --> 2:28:16.660]  kyle you know the only individuals that kyle uh had no choice but to shoot were those who were
[2:28:16.660 --> 2:28:22.260]  attempting to kill him um you know i i've had a good fortune i was in the army for a few years
[2:28:22.260 --> 2:28:26.820]  just shooted plywood targets with an m1 tank but i've had the good fortune to you know get to
[2:28:26.820 --> 2:28:32.260]  know some really elite uh you know former special operations folks uh some of whom helped us with
[2:28:32.260 --> 2:28:37.620]  the extraction in november 20th and i gotta tell you to a person these guys can't believe it they
[2:28:37.620 --> 2:28:43.220]  can't believe the restraint that he showed the situational awareness he showed there were individuals
[2:28:43.220 --> 2:28:49.940]  who were right around him who probably could have been considered um you know a real threat um and
[2:28:49.940 --> 2:28:57.700]  kyle was very very restrained um and you know as soon as uh the events uh uh you know unfolded
[2:28:57.700 --> 2:29:03.060]  he immediately turned around and calmly started walking toward the police line attempted to turn
[2:29:03.060 --> 2:29:08.500]  himself in and the police didn't even view him as a threat and told him to go home so this isn't a
[2:29:08.500 --> 2:29:14.900]  this is this is this is quite the kid this is quite the 17-year-old kid well i don't want to
[2:29:15.540 --> 2:29:21.540]  compare kyle to obi-wan kanobi but in the in the famous episode four first star wars bar scene
[2:29:21.540 --> 2:29:26.500]  when the guy pulls the gun on luke skywalker uh and obi-wan kanobi doesn't kill him just cuts his
[2:29:26.500 --> 2:29:32.500]  arm off was very obi-wan kanobi in the video because the guy's raising the gun saying i'm screaming
[2:29:32.500 --> 2:29:37.940]  you know i'm gonna f and kill you aiming already shot him once aiming the gun at him and then he
[2:29:37.940 --> 2:29:43.060]  shoots him right in the arm to make him stop i mean that is very obi-wan kanobi ask uh what kyle
[2:29:43.060 --> 2:29:51.460]  did just amazing that individual actually had a live stream uh going um and you know as kyle was
[2:29:51.460 --> 2:29:55.780]  running down the street desperately trying to retreat to the police line this individual asked
[2:29:55.780 --> 2:29:59.060]  uh you know kyle what what are you doing where you're going kyle said and everybody's everybody
[2:29:59.060 --> 2:30:06.900]  in the world seen this i'm going to the police and despite that this this vicious mob relentlessly
[2:30:06.900 --> 2:30:14.260]  attempted to hunt him down uh and to kill him almost succeeded uh almost succeeded and thank god
[2:30:14.820 --> 2:30:21.060]  kyle was about a half second quicker um and and that's why he's alive today uh he did nothing wrong
[2:30:21.620 --> 2:30:27.780]  he did what any uh law abiding american citizen uh would have done it should have done it in those
[2:30:27.780 --> 2:30:31.860]  circumstances uh and we're gonna we're gonna fight just the very end and we're gonna win
[2:30:31.860 --> 2:30:36.660]  it's just shows the arrogance of the left though that he has all the evidence that he
[2:30:37.700 --> 2:30:43.140]  was doing a great job helping the community and then they attack him he defends himself
[2:30:43.140 --> 2:30:47.220]  very measured and then they're still trying to put him in prison i know he's gonna beat all
[2:30:47.220 --> 2:30:51.300]  this thanks to prayer and support but you know they're trying to railroad him obviously how
[2:30:51.300 --> 2:30:56.100]  how many years in prison is he facing under these seven charges and in closing sir please tell us
[2:30:56.100 --> 2:31:00.980]  what the new charges they've added yeah he could he could go well if he were convicted he would go
[2:31:00.980 --> 2:31:05.220]  to jail for the rest of his life obviously we're not gonna let that happen but they're trying to
[2:31:05.220 --> 2:31:08.660]  throw the book at him uh they're trying to shut him up and send him to jail forever and they're
[2:31:08.660 --> 2:31:14.260]  trying to put the fear of god into every other american uh who might actually stand up uh and
[2:31:14.260 --> 2:31:21.380]  defend our soil our cities um you know from from from this kind of conduct um so the additional
[2:31:21.380 --> 2:31:25.780]  charge that has been added and i i almost i mean look i can believe anything at this point almost
[2:31:25.780 --> 2:31:31.140]  in this case uh but i saw this last night and i i i could hardly believe it so after four months
[2:31:31.140 --> 2:31:37.620]  they have somehow decided that uh you know six six you know homicide related type charges against
[2:31:37.620 --> 2:31:43.460]  child or not enough so they would tack on a seventh charge for violation of the curfew now
[2:31:44.340 --> 2:31:49.700]  you've seen those videos alex um you think there were other people violating curfew
[2:31:49.700 --> 2:31:55.300]  well you had the left thing go out and do this and so they're the ones they're the politicians
[2:31:55.300 --> 2:32:00.100]  pushing it they're the soros people that over through ukraine and everything else simply amazing

[2:38:03.460 --> 2:38:10.660]  so i was thinking about criminology over the weekend and about how bill gates gets off
[2:38:11.540 --> 2:38:14.740]  when he talks about we just shoot gmo right in the face of children
[2:38:16.180 --> 2:38:21.300]  700 000 or he gets sick and die but it's good you're gonna do it the lockbell's never gonna
[2:38:21.300 --> 2:38:26.180]  yeah i mean he starts getting so excited i can't even imitate it he's like he's having orgasm
[2:38:27.540 --> 2:38:32.340]  i thought you know i've seen serial killer interviews where they talk about murdering people
[2:38:32.340 --> 2:38:36.580]  they're totally calm and they get excited like yes i didn't like my mother i cut her head off
[2:38:36.580 --> 2:38:41.300]  i really enjoyed it you know the co-ed girls i'd see them they were so pretty i take them
[2:38:41.300 --> 2:38:45.380]  on to a nice spot and then i just couldn't help but i had to torture them and murder them
[2:38:46.740 --> 2:38:51.380]  so i i went and looked up a few serial killers and found some of those videos but never even
[2:38:51.380 --> 2:38:56.180]  gave them to the crew but then our archive is the great guy we've hired a few months ago
[2:38:56.180 --> 2:39:02.420]  i guess six months ago he already put together one and found other clips that i hadn't seen yet
[2:39:02.420 --> 2:39:07.300]  mixed with bill gates that's coming up next segment a little short segment and paul watson's
[2:39:07.300 --> 2:39:14.580]  taking over but um it's crazy i mean you put him in the stuff he says next to psychopaths
[2:39:14.580 --> 2:39:20.820]  and the way they're behaving and what they're saying and it's dead on and talking about well
[2:39:20.820 --> 2:39:26.900]  we got a lower humans down to zero oh we gotta have death panels oh they're not supposed to say
[2:39:26.900 --> 2:39:36.100]  that i mean it is creep a zoid so i love it i mentioned this yesterday and already not just
[2:39:36.100 --> 2:39:40.420]  our archivist it's showing up on youtube people don't know yeah editing men with psychopaths
[2:39:40.420 --> 2:39:44.740]  so there's a more than one way to skin a cat so a lot of exciting things happening but
[2:39:46.100 --> 2:39:49.940]  it's you buying the products that lets me have the money to have an archivist who now
[2:39:49.940 --> 2:39:53.380]  is so good i don't know how he does it got to meet him in dc he was there visiting
[2:39:54.020 --> 2:39:59.060]  we were there a few weeks ago i i could say i remember 10 years ago i said this like the next
[2:39:59.060 --> 2:40:04.020]  day he's found it my crew is great but they can never do that i don't know how this guy does it
[2:40:04.020 --> 2:40:08.580]  i don't know what's going on but it's crazy and now there's like videos every day i'm just where i
[2:40:08.580 --> 2:40:12.580]  lay it all out they're gonna release a simulant bio weapon as the lockdown and then once we go into
[2:40:12.580 --> 2:40:16.260]  the lockdown of control and once robots are taking over within five or ten years they'll release a more
[2:40:16.260 --> 2:40:22.660]  powerful bio weapons thing and then it's all happening in real time because i read all their
[2:40:22.660 --> 2:40:27.460]  documents i study them and then i know how they operate and what what they'll do next because
[2:40:27.460 --> 2:40:34.180]  they they operate very pathologically everybody gets into pathology everybody gets into doing
[2:40:34.180 --> 2:40:37.940]  the same thing over and over again especially as you get older but any law enforcement any good
[2:40:37.940 --> 2:40:46.980]  profilers will tell you criminals psychos especially but sociopaths as well they get very neurotic
[2:40:46.980 --> 2:40:54.740]  about how they do everything very neurotic very a lot of times very fastidious very obsessive
[2:40:54.740 --> 2:40:59.780]  like i saw the new movie fat man with mel Gibson he's good good movie overall very entertaining
[2:40:59.780 --> 2:41:05.140]  but the psycho and that's very fastidious very neurotic very very weird and also likes to do
[2:41:05.140 --> 2:41:09.620]  things the same way over and over again and so i've just learned what they're going to do and
[2:41:09.620 --> 2:41:15.620]  so 95 percent of the show is researched the other five percent is okay this is what they're going
[2:41:15.620 --> 2:41:22.020]  to do next and it's almost always dead on because these people are psychotic and a normal people
[2:41:22.020 --> 2:41:28.740]  are not like that but but but psychos are so turned over to to what they do and and they're
[2:41:28.740 --> 2:41:35.620]  high functioning psychotic is is is what they're called in fact the worst psychotics have super
[2:41:35.620 --> 2:41:40.900]  iqs and there's some genetic disorders where they have double chromosomes double male chromosomes
[2:41:40.900 --> 2:41:47.620]  double some of the other chromosomes dealing with aggression masculinity it doesn't even mean like
[2:41:47.620 --> 2:41:52.420]  you'd fix some giant dude built like whole kogan would have the psycho gene no no no that's not
[2:41:52.420 --> 2:41:59.300]  what they look like they're actually very usually very very skinny very very skinny is is what some
[2:41:59.300 --> 2:42:04.980]  of the mutations will show and a lot of times very tall as well and it turns out that most of your
[2:42:04.980 --> 2:42:10.820]  really bad male serial killers are extremely tall so a lot of it is genetic and it's very very
[2:42:10.820 --> 2:42:17.460]  sick folks very very sick now when you look at bill gates that is a literal super demon a literal
[2:42:17.460 --> 2:42:24.100]  super killing machine and he has the celebrations on tv which with a psycho is there is what they
[2:42:24.100 --> 2:42:29.540]  love to do by so many psychos like sin letters the police you'll never catch me you'll never get me
[2:42:29.540 --> 2:42:32.900]  or they'll even brag about it it's why in hollywood they tell you what they're going to do to you
[2:42:32.900 --> 2:42:40.340]  before they do it and they just hate everyone and it's like a kid pulling you know the legs off
[2:42:40.340 --> 2:42:45.140]  a frog or something except they do it to people in mass and of course a lot of times it's genetic
[2:42:45.140 --> 2:42:52.580]  you know his dad uh was clearly a genetic psychotic psychotic um mark zuckerberg is a genetic
[2:42:52.580 --> 2:42:57.460]  psychopath and boy when i called him a genetic psychopath because he obviously knows you know
[2:42:57.460 --> 2:43:01.700]  that you can look at him and see he's got the chromosome disorder uh there was several of them
[2:43:01.700 --> 2:43:07.300]  but he's definitely got the disorder um he got so pissed he said the last straw was jones calling
[2:43:07.300 --> 2:43:13.860]  me a genetic psychopath because oh by the way you know the protege the aid the camp the apprentice
[2:43:13.860 --> 2:43:18.580]  of bill gates is right i mean you know it's mark zuckerberg i mean they're on record they vacation
[2:43:18.580 --> 2:43:23.460]  together they both wear pink sweaters uh he's carrying out the operations of bill gates after
[2:43:23.460 --> 2:43:30.020]  gates makes the jump into hyperspace like bill gates his dad bill gates the third i guess that
[2:43:30.020 --> 2:43:37.620]  makes bill gates the fourth or whatever just bad bill um paul watson has a lot to cover
[2:43:37.620 --> 2:43:45.780]  i only scratched the surface here of the big enchilada today i didn't get to it
[2:43:47.220 --> 2:43:52.100]  and i can't really do justice to this now with the time i have so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
[2:43:52.100 --> 2:43:58.180]  shoot a special report right after i'm not live i'm gonna take a five minute break
[2:43:59.460 --> 2:44:06.740]  and have a nice glass of water and then i'm going to go and i'm going to shoot a whole report on
[2:44:06.740 --> 2:44:11.700]  this latest development where you you saw a few months ago they got the canadian document about
[2:44:11.700 --> 2:44:15.940]  the next lockdowns coming and then there'll be the strain too and then we'll never unlock things
[2:44:15.940 --> 2:44:21.940]  until the communist takeover happens people said is this real uh yes where it leaked from is documented
[2:44:21.940 --> 2:44:26.980]  the fact that it is a real documents real but forget that i just simply had my true research
[2:44:26.980 --> 2:44:32.500]  the document and of course pieces of it are in all the other documents which are public so
[2:44:32.500 --> 2:44:37.460]  yes it's all premeditated it's a takeover plan claus swab has already said it the great reset but
[2:44:37.460 --> 2:44:44.020]  but here it is here it is for all of you and also i'm going to get back when i have more time
[2:44:44.820 --> 2:44:50.180]  into the hospitals being basically empty nationwide so they have tiny covet areas where
[2:44:50.180 --> 2:44:54.660]  they say we've got three beds in a hospital of 200 beds it's covet so when you get a fourth covet
[2:44:54.660 --> 2:45:03.300]  patient you go we're overwhelmed by covet it's all statistical fraud management that's all coming up and
[2:45:03.300 --> 2:45:09.060]  i'm also going to get into their banning term brown bag brown bags are racist we've got a bunch of
[2:45:09.060 --> 2:45:15.700]  election news i didn't get to yet but paul watson will lock it out of the park in a big way but the
[2:45:15.700 --> 2:45:18.820]  globalists want to depopulate you they want to teach you don't have a live force they want to
[2:45:18.820 --> 2:45:22.420]  teach you to hate yourself so you'll roll over and let them rule everything they want computers
[2:45:22.420 --> 2:45:26.580]  monitoring everything you do that's the covet rollout it's now all official and the good news is
[2:45:26.580 --> 2:45:31.700]  it's all out in the open now so no need to eat around the edges here uh people are really is
[2:45:31.700 --> 2:45:38.180]  they're going to get it or they're going to succumb and get hurt real real bad yeah go ahead
[2:45:38.180 --> 2:45:42.180]  and print me that article out of canada too as well because the document even said what date they
[2:45:42.180 --> 2:45:45.780]  would announce you know the stage four and five lockdown and they did and the document's real
[2:45:46.420 --> 2:45:50.580]  you can reverse engineer the whole thing but i just don't like people for months saying is it real
[2:45:50.580 --> 2:45:54.180]  david ike is like a viral video with millions of views where he goes i don't know if this is a real
[2:45:54.180 --> 2:46:00.420]  document but they did it all on the exact dates it says yes it's real yes it's real yes it's real
[2:46:00.420 --> 2:46:06.260]  yes it's real yes it's real and so we're going to go over all of that coming up separately
[2:46:07.300 --> 2:46:11.860]  we have had major shortfalls this year the audience has been three four five times what it normally is
[2:46:13.300 --> 2:46:17.540]  import is having a mega effect but they've shut the economy down and people don't have as much money
[2:46:17.540 --> 2:46:22.020]  as they used to because they killed the trump recovery i get it i need to be able to operate in
[2:46:22.020 --> 2:46:25.620]  the next year i know you want to keep us on air at this critical time plus we got great products

[2:47:40.740 --> 2:47:46.340]  even though our order was in before it ran out because the supply chains breaking down because
[2:47:46.340 --> 2:47:50.980]  if one person in the warehouse gets it they close the whole damn warehouse but china is open for
[2:47:50.980 --> 2:47:56.420]  business that's the economic sabotage so under biden i'm worried about an endless lockdown even

[2:48:33.780 --> 2:48:38.820]  holding how you doing alex man i'm just working as far as i can we're in such a critical time
[2:48:38.820 --> 2:48:44.900]  brother how are you i love you man i want to uh make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've
[2:48:44.900 --> 2:48:49.860]  been using it quite a while and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see
[2:48:49.860 --> 2:48:56.900]  that it contains quercetin which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited
[2:48:56.900 --> 2:49:04.660]  is an ion of four similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cell so
[2:49:04.660 --> 2:49:10.660]  people might want to take a look at that if all i know is with dna force we went out and looked
[2:49:10.660 --> 2:49:15.620]  at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the
[2:49:15.620 --> 2:49:19.060]  doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's
[2:49:19.060 --> 2:49:24.340]  really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together
[2:49:24.340 --> 2:49:30.820]  and that's what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug
[2:49:32.580 --> 2:49:37.860]  webster's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism other dictionaries have
[2:49:37.860 --> 2:49:44.740]  similar ones terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or
[2:49:44.740 --> 2:49:51.300]  financial reason it's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them that's exactly
[2:49:51.300 --> 2:49:57.140]  what all this overblown covid 19 garbage is you see the headlines from cnn abc news doctors say
[2:49:57.140 --> 2:50:02.420]  it's worse than they ever thought covid more double say they could ever imagine they told us that
[2:50:03.140 --> 2:50:09.140]  two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months okay it's a
[2:50:09.140 --> 2:50:14.740]  quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things we're talking 96 had
[2:50:14.740 --> 2:50:19.700]  comorbidity these are real numbers these are real facts this is the chicken little event we'll run
[2:50:19.700 --> 2:50:24.340]  our houses never come out and are taught we're not essential all the big box tours in amazon
[2:50:24.340 --> 2:50:30.260]  take over the planet repute you could stand up against it this is slavery it is not something
[2:50:30.260 --> 2:50:38.820]  you can put up with and survive you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:38.820 --> 2:50:53.940]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide i'm alex jones your host
[2:50:58.260 --> 2:51:02.260]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:51:02.260 --> 2:51:12.260]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones so bill gates says 700 000 people
[2:51:12.260 --> 2:51:17.380]  will get sick and die from his vaccine alone but it's a good price to pay and he has liability
[2:51:17.380 --> 2:51:22.420]  protection and he says you're going to take it he's your doctor now his father headed up planned
[2:51:22.420 --> 2:51:28.580]  parenthood and was a known eugenicist part of the ibm's major eugenics boards with his mother also
[2:51:28.580 --> 2:51:34.260]  on the board of ibm eugenics ibm's head was the highest level nazi even above hitler receiving
[2:51:34.260 --> 2:51:40.660]  the highest award in germany bill gates runs the trust of the head of ibm here is a breakdown
[2:51:41.780 --> 2:51:47.860]  i'm a big serial killer by the way eight eight people that's nothing i mean there's ignore that
[2:51:47.860 --> 2:51:53.780]  pile of bodies over in the corner well i'm not an expert i'm not an authority i'm someone who has
[2:51:53.780 --> 2:52:01.300]  been a murderer for almost 20 years there'll be rumors that the polio vaccine uh is to sterilize
[2:52:01.300 --> 2:52:08.660]  women now if we do a really great job on new vaccines health care reproductive health services
[2:52:08.660 --> 2:52:16.980]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent i would also reduce uh the the some of that over
[2:52:16.980 --> 2:52:22.580]  population then we thought wow we can go full speed and in the science it was a great time
[2:52:22.580 --> 2:52:28.340]  because the ability to invent new vaccines sterilize women and it took about four three or
[2:52:28.340 --> 2:52:34.820]  four strikes to cut that off now we could have taken the blood of survivors process it and put
[2:52:34.820 --> 2:52:43.220]  that plasma back in people to protect them right and i bit into that meat it was you know the human
[2:52:43.220 --> 2:52:54.180]  flesh vaccines are often subject to these rumors then was a molesterer at 18 months old the urge
[2:52:54.180 --> 2:53:00.100]  to kill had overpowered him as police later learned he wasn't satisfied with his victim's death
[2:53:00.100 --> 2:53:06.980]  he wanted more even the deaths uh we don't find that totally easy uh to get right then i tried to uh
[2:53:06.980 --> 2:53:14.980]  uh keeps the person alive by inducing a zombie-like state they're trying to brainwash us
[2:53:16.420 --> 2:53:26.740]  by uh injecting uh first uh dilute acid solution into their brain we're taking things that are
[2:53:26.740 --> 2:53:32.340]  you know genetically modified organisms and we're injecting them in little kids arms we just
[2:53:32.340 --> 2:53:37.540]  shoot them right into the vein vaccines make sure your most vulnerable populations get it
[2:53:37.540 --> 2:53:42.980]  uh in in our country that would be blacks and native americans i just want everyone to know that
[2:53:43.700 --> 2:53:52.660]  i think this vaccination is the worst thing ever and i would not give this to anybody
[2:53:53.220 --> 2:54:01.620]  even my worst enemy you girls are a little more cautious about who you pick up in the singles bar
[2:54:01.620 --> 2:54:12.580]  take home like mr good boy right please america they do not care about us do not take this vaccination
[2:54:13.140 --> 2:54:17.780]  when it was revealed that most of the victims were black so i always feel bad for afghan leaders
[2:54:17.780 --> 2:54:24.100]  10 of your 17 victims were black were they racially motivated it was not racially motivated
[2:54:24.100 --> 2:54:33.300]  thank you men sterilized women the vaccine work is phenomenal
[2:54:34.900 --> 2:54:40.740]  the best way to fool people is to help them is to uh ask what they want ask what they need
[2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:47.700]  do they need any help doing anything do they do uh do they need any money or do they need
[2:54:47.700 --> 2:54:52.660]  their car fix do you need the grass cut do they need uh their children look out universal income
[2:54:52.660 --> 2:54:58.420]  side effects for the moderna vaccine sound concerning we looked after the second dose at
[2:54:58.420 --> 2:55:05.620]  least 80 percent of participants experienced a systemic side effect ranging from severe chills
[2:55:05.620 --> 2:55:16.900]  to fevers so are these vaccines safe anything anything to get them to think that i am a decent
[2:55:16.900 --> 2:55:25.220]  person and want to help trust me i will help that are going out there and yes i think you
[2:55:25.220 --> 2:55:29.780]  know the data better than i do but the bill bill that the data show that everybody with a high
[2:55:29.780 --> 2:55:37.460]  dose had a side effect yeah but some of that is is not dramatic where you know it's just
[2:55:37.460 --> 2:55:44.980]  you know super painful but yes the post industrial world that's what george herbert
[2:55:44.980 --> 2:55:52.980]  walker bush signed on to it the Rio de Janeiro agenda 21 conference back in 1992 now they've
[2:55:52.980 --> 2:55:59.460]  launched agenda 2030 which is a post industrial world plow schwa with the debaust group trudeau
[2:55:59.460 --> 2:56:06.420]  the prime minister of piano they're all on record saying the great reset is agenda 2030 well you might
[2:56:06.420 --> 2:56:12.500]  want to find out what agenda 2030 is it is the destruction of society as we know it it is making
[2:56:12.500 --> 2:56:19.860]  the population war by designs we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family
[2:56:19.860 --> 2:56:26.420]  they're destroying civilization rebuild it and they're just helping image we are fighting this
[2:56:27.060 --> 2:56:32.660]  at info wars dot com and news wars dot com we are fighting for a pro human future and we need you
[2:56:32.660 --> 2:56:38.020]  to get the facts to research and share with others and join the fight god bless you visit us
[2:56:38.020 --> 2:56:49.380]  spread the word at info wars dot com transmitting worldwide from the summit dot news studios in
[2:56:49.380 --> 2:56:59.380]  the united kingdom you are listening to paul joseph watson we alive welcome back everybody this is
[2:56:59.380 --> 2:57:06.100]  the summit news hour hope you had a good christmas hope you managed to see your family not something
[2:57:06.100 --> 2:57:12.980]  that i was allowed to do because we had another lockdown international travel was banned now the
[2:57:12.980 --> 2:57:17.780]  lockdown once again has worked so well that we're going to have what looks like a third lockdown
[2:57:18.340 --> 2:57:24.260]  in january here in the uk and all these crippling measures that have impacted the economy all these
[2:57:24.260 --> 2:57:29.540]  untreated illnesses that are going to end up causing more deaths than coronavirus itself
[2:57:30.100 --> 2:57:35.780]  depression mental illness all of this well get ready for more because the world health
[2:57:35.780 --> 2:57:44.180]  organization says that it's just a warm-up headline at summit dot news wHO bigger pandemic than
[2:57:44.180 --> 2:57:50.420]  covid is coming as if this wasn't enough and of course they've said this is going to run through
[2:57:50.420 --> 2:57:56.260]  until at least 2022 but then apparently there's another one lined up the world health organization
[2:57:56.260 --> 2:58:01.940]  has warned that a worse pandemic than covid could be around the corner and that what we've seen so
[2:58:01.940 --> 2:58:08.820]  far in 2020 is not necessarily the big one because of course if you actually look at the
[2:58:09.620 --> 2:58:15.780]  fatality numbers for covid based on what they originally projected and used as a justification
[2:58:15.780 --> 2:58:22.580]  for these global lockdowns not very fatal so the who is promising that they've got an even
[2:58:22.580 --> 2:58:26.900]  bigger one lined up can't wait with global lockdowns international stripping of freedoms
[2:58:26.900 --> 2:58:31.380]  and the decimation of small businesses and the economy on the whole is difficult to imagine
[2:58:31.380 --> 2:58:38.900]  how it could get any worse oh yes indeed it can the head of the who emergencies program
[2:58:38.900 --> 2:58:43.940]  dr mike ryan said during a media briefing that this pandemic has been very severe it's affected
[2:58:43.940 --> 2:58:49.540]  every corner of the planet but it's not necessarily the big one he said that despite the vaccine the
[2:58:49.540 --> 2:58:56.340]  virus is set to become endemic and will never go away which is why now they're aiming and you see
[2:58:56.340 --> 2:59:00.980]  this especially in scotland with nicolas sturgeon you're beginning to see it increasingly in other
[2:59:00.980 --> 2:59:05.780]  countries they're talking about like they talk about zero carbon emissions which is basically
[2:59:05.780 --> 2:59:11.780]  impossible unless you completely topple our living standards across the board they're now talking
[2:59:11.780 --> 2:59:19.700]  about zero covid and of course if it becomes endemic as the who is now saying it's never
[2:59:19.700 --> 2:59:24.340]  going to be zero there's always going to be covid cases so there's always going to be another
[2:59:24.340 --> 2:59:31.540]  excuse to lock down to strip you of your freedoms even with the vaccine then of course the vaccine
[2:59:31.540 --> 2:59:36.340]  will stop working because the virus mutates and then you'll need another vaccine there'll be another
[2:59:36.340 --> 2:59:42.420]  virus you see how this is going this is never going to end unless there's mass resistance this
[2:59:42.420 --> 2:59:49.220]  is never going to end there's no recovery in spring there's no recovery next summer it started
[2:59:49.220 --> 2:59:56.420]  in the uk is them saying a lockdown for three weeks to protect the nhs they said for three weeks
[2:59:56.980 --> 3:00:00.500]  now in some quarters they're saying three years
[3:00:02.820 --> 3:00:09.060]  mr ryan said the likely scenarios the virus will become endemic and professor david hayman the chair
[3:00:09.060 --> 3:00:14.900]  of the who strategic and technical advisory group for infectious hazards added that it appears
[3:00:14.900 --> 3:00:20.500]  covid 19 is set to become endemic as have four other human coronaviruses and that it will continue
[3:00:20.500 --> 3:00:26.020]  to mutate as it reproduces in human cells especially in areas of more intense admission
[3:00:27.140 --> 3:00:32.660]  elsewhere chief scientist dr sumer swamith and said that the rollout of vaccines does not mean
[3:00:32.660 --> 3:00:39.300]  social distancing or mask wearing can go away the entire point of them pushing the vaccine at the
[3:00:39.300 --> 3:00:45.940]  start of the discussions of it was to say this is how we get back to normal the entire premise of
[3:00:45.940 --> 3:00:53.620]  the initial lockdown was this is how we get back to normal no normal is not coming back this is the
[3:00:53.620 --> 3:01:02.100]  new normal they say jump you say how high so the who is now saying that this is basically a warm-up
[3:01:04.100 --> 3:01:08.900]  whatever the lethality of the virus they're just going to keep apparently rolling them out
[3:01:08.900 --> 3:01:14.580]  can't wait for that meanwhile the entire country has been locked down based on what
[3:01:14.580 --> 3:01:23.460]  a journalist in the uk has pointed out based on just 377 healthy people under the age of 60 dying
[3:01:23.460 --> 3:01:30.740]  of covid in the united kingdom headline journalists hounded after pointing out that only old and sick
[3:01:30.740 --> 3:01:35.940]  die from covid because again apparently we've got this thing in the western world where suddenly
[3:01:35.940 --> 3:01:42.580]  post march 2020 we just couldn't handle the fact that old people get sick and die like that's never
[3:01:42.580 --> 3:01:48.100]  happened before and it just suddenly started happening and we couldn't deal with it as a society
[3:01:49.220 --> 3:01:54.340]  but a british journalist has been targeted by an on angry online mob after pointing out that only
[3:01:54.340 --> 3:01:59.060]  a relatively small amount of healthy people have died from covid and suggesting that the complete
[3:01:59.060 --> 3:02:06.340]  destruction of our way of life is not an adequate response she was trending she got hounded she
[3:02:06.340 --> 3:02:12.660]  got catcalled by the mob this was talk radio host julia heartley brewer who used the national health
[3:02:12.660 --> 3:02:20.580]  services own statistics to point out that just 377 healthy people under 60 have died of covid
[3:02:21.620 --> 3:02:28.260]  she said that's not a typo there are no zeros missing while saying that it further noting that
[3:02:28.260 --> 3:02:32.500]  further noting that pointing this out doesn't mean she's saying to hell with the old and sick but
[3:02:32.500 --> 3:02:38.020]  of course the reaction was immediately impugning her but supposedly saying exactly that despite
[3:02:38.020 --> 3:02:42.980]  the fact that she said the opposite of it some people wouldn't hear it raging that heartley
[3:02:42.980 --> 3:02:47.860]  brewer was a despicable human being and you can go on and read the tweets about that literally
[3:02:47.860 --> 3:02:55.540]  pointing out official government health statistics she was absolutely crucified absolutely
[3:02:55.540 --> 3:03:03.780]  crucified and as i pointed out before you compare the hospital bed occupancy rates in december 2020
[3:03:03.780 --> 3:03:13.860]  compared to december 2019 in december 2019 hospital beds were 95 full in england now with
[3:03:13.860 --> 3:03:20.900]  this huge pandemic and supposedly overwhelmed hospitals and as sky news claims today ambulances
[3:03:20.900 --> 3:03:26.740]  queuing outside hospitals because they're so overwhelmed what is the occupancy rate now compared
[3:03:26.740 --> 3:03:36.500]  to a year ago pre-covid compared to 95 percent in december 2019 it's 89 percent the beds are less
[3:03:36.500 --> 3:03:45.060]  full than pre-covid and in fact i tweeted another statistic on this again based on the nhs's own
[3:03:45.060 --> 3:03:50.260]  numbers apparently you'll get absolutely sabotaged by a twitter mob if you quote government
[3:03:50.260 --> 3:03:57.060]  statistics it says critical care bed occupancy rates versus three-year average they're actually
[3:03:57.060 --> 3:04:04.020]  lower not only compared to last year but compared to the three-year average and you can see across
[3:04:04.020 --> 3:04:10.500]  all the different regions east of england london midlands northeastern yorkshire the blue shows
[3:04:10.500 --> 3:04:18.580]  what it was for the average december 2017 to 19 compared to what it is in december 2020 and of
[3:04:18.580 --> 3:04:26.900]  course 2017 to 18 was a particularly bad flu year in the united kingdom and that's why they had a lot
[3:04:26.900 --> 3:04:34.260]  of hospital beds being occupied did we shut down the entire economy did we start saying that people
[3:04:34.260 --> 3:04:40.980]  would need to take a vaccine to get into venues to fly to have any freedom of mobility because
[3:04:40.980 --> 3:04:46.740]  hospital beds were quite full for a single year because all people were getting the flu and dying
[3:04:46.740 --> 3:04:53.460]  no we didn't it wasn't even a news story so the hospital beds are emptier than they were
[3:04:54.180 --> 3:05:00.740]  this time last year and now this is interesting former sage advisor admits he thought we couldn't
[3:05:00.740 --> 3:05:07.940]  get away with chinese style lockdown in europe so they literally came out and said could you
[3:05:07.940 --> 3:05:14.580]  believe that they actually accepted this the plebs actually submitted and caved we didn't think we
[3:05:14.580 --> 3:05:20.340]  could get away with it because china's response to corona virus is so great isn't it so great that
[3:05:20.340 --> 3:05:25.460]  they're literally arresting arresting and torturing the whistleblowers who actually told the truth
[3:05:25.460 --> 3:05:32.820]  about it at the start now china's the big model the big example for how to deal with it but former
[3:05:32.820 --> 3:05:40.740]  uk government covet 19 advisor neil ferguson who by the way violated his own lockdown by going to
[3:05:40.740 --> 3:05:46.260]  have sex with his married mistress admits that he thought we couldn't get away with imposing
[3:05:46.260 --> 3:05:53.300]  communist chinese style lockdowns in europe because they were too draconian this was in an interview
[3:05:53.300 --> 3:05:58.820]  with the london times where ferguson said quote it's a communist one party state we could we said
[3:05:58.820 --> 3:06:05.380]  we couldn't get away with it in europe we thought and then italy did it and we realized we could
[3:06:05.380 --> 3:06:11.460]  and as peter hitchens commented they thought they couldn't get away with malice repression in europe
[3:06:11.460 --> 3:06:17.140]  then they found they could shame on those have should have defended our liberty in march but didn't
[3:06:17.140 --> 3:06:22.900]  oh by the way china's lockdown was so great that now there's a new outbreak in china and i'm going
[3:06:22.900 --> 3:06:28.660]  to get into that after the break we're also gonna get into how the vaccine is causing more deaths
[3:06:28.660 --> 3:06:35.140]  more deaths more side effects that is all coming up in the next segment summit dot news will be right
[3:06:35.140 --> 3:06:43.460]  back don't go away three two one here we go it's back in stock it's been sold out for over eight

[3:08:51.460 --> 3:08:56.980]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:08:56.980 --> 3:09:06.500]  now we're gonna get into the creeping health fascism of these vaccines of course all the
[3:09:06.500 --> 3:09:11.300]  government came out initially and said oh we're not gonna make it mandatory god forbid
[3:09:11.940 --> 3:09:16.020]  and then of course we started to learn about what you would not be allowed to do if you
[3:09:16.020 --> 3:09:21.620]  didn't take the vaccine and now more measures in terms of surveillance of people who refuse to do
[3:09:21.620 --> 3:09:27.140]  that in spain but i'm going to get into that afterwards first there's an excellent article
[3:09:27.140 --> 3:09:34.900]  at spiked online by Fraser Myers with the headline lockdown a deadly failed experiment and he goes
[3:09:34.900 --> 3:09:40.580]  through the figures with links to official studies proving that the countries and areas in the world
[3:09:40.580 --> 3:09:47.220]  that impose the most draconian lockdowns the most severe mask mandates have actually had
[3:09:47.220 --> 3:09:53.860]  more coronavirus infections more deaths and other areas that didn't he says it's been a global
[3:09:53.860 --> 3:10:00.580]  catastrophe we must never go down this road again talking about the lockdowns he says the country
[3:10:00.580 --> 3:10:06.820]  this year which has been most ravaged by COVID-19 losing a shocking 1600 people in every million
[3:10:07.540 --> 3:10:13.140]  so the virus at the time of writing is belgium you haven't really heard about that in the news have
[3:10:13.140 --> 3:10:19.540]  you he says this may come as something of a surprise he could be forgiven for thinking it was America
[3:10:19.540 --> 3:10:24.980]  thanks to trump's alleged ignorance of science so what about britain which locked down too late
[3:10:24.980 --> 3:10:29.540]  because of its government short-lived but foolish belief in freedom actually of course as we know
[3:10:29.540 --> 3:10:35.620]  with the stats in britain showed that the infection rate was going down before lockdown was imposed
[3:10:35.620 --> 3:10:41.540]  but then they used that to say that lockdowns work of course we had another lockdown in London
[3:10:41.540 --> 3:10:47.540]  recently and there were more infections after it than before it and what's the solution to that oh
[3:10:47.540 --> 3:10:53.780]  it's another lockdown he continues all brazil whose right-wing leader complained that lockdowns and
[3:10:53.780 --> 3:10:59.140]  masks were for fags if not those then truly sweden where there has famously been no hard
[3:10:59.140 --> 3:11:04.580]  lockdown at all but no the country that has suffered the most is belgium he says there's
[3:11:04.580 --> 3:11:09.300]  nothing particularly unusual about belgium's response nothing that diverged significantly
[3:11:09.300 --> 3:11:15.300]  from the consensus it did the same thing as everyone else around the same time everyone else did
[3:11:15.300 --> 3:11:21.380]  they even garnered praise for its testing capacity but there's one caveat belgium's
[3:11:21.380 --> 3:11:26.500]  and parallel death rate might be down to how the deaths accounted some say belgium is merely
[3:11:26.500 --> 3:11:31.780]  the most honest country while others have accused officials of over counting and including all kinds
[3:11:31.780 --> 3:11:37.460]  of deaths not caused by covid but go down the list of deaths per million and you find more places
[3:11:37.460 --> 3:11:43.940]  you might not expect so it's hard to hit italy's in second place but it was the first to get hit in
[3:11:43.940 --> 3:11:48.660]  the west so we should let them off then there's slovenia which was relatively unscathed in the
[3:11:48.660 --> 3:11:55.220]  spring after that it's peru peru announced one of the earliest lockdowns in the world on 16th of
[3:11:55.220 --> 3:12:01.140]  march the first in latin america the restrictions were some of the most stringent on the planet
[3:12:01.140 --> 3:12:08.020]  enforced by the military masks were made mandatory in public but by may two months in cases began to
[3:12:08.020 --> 3:12:13.540]  jump considerably and you look at the grass for all these european countries belgium italy spain
[3:12:13.540 --> 3:12:20.740]  france when they introduced the most draconian mask mandates including in countries like spain
[3:12:20.740 --> 3:12:27.700]  where you have to wear them outside never mind inside all the time the cases skyrocketed and yet
[3:12:27.700 --> 3:12:34.580]  they say that masks were it continues masks were made mandatory in public but by may two months in
[3:12:34.580 --> 3:12:41.140]  cases began to jump considerably this was despite the country doing everything right and right on
[3:12:41.140 --> 3:12:46.500]  time there was some easing of the lockdown from june onwards but social gatherings were still illegal
[3:12:46.500 --> 3:12:53.620]  in august by which point 200 people were dying per day then he talks about elsewhere in latin
[3:12:53.620 --> 3:13:00.580]  america argentina experienced a similar mid-lockdown explosion in cases and deaths its lockdown began
[3:13:00.580 --> 3:13:05.780]  on 20th of march and was supposed to be short and short just like we were told here in the uk it
[3:13:05.780 --> 3:13:12.180]  ended up becoming the longest continuous lockdown in the world in june time magazine hailed argentina's
[3:13:12.180 --> 3:13:18.660]  success in containing the virus but not long after cases began to surge the deadliest day of its
[3:13:18.660 --> 3:13:26.580]  pandemic was on day 145 of lockdown so again you see this process the media praises these
[3:13:26.580 --> 3:13:31.940]  countries for their swift draconian response and then when it's revealed that it had no effect
[3:13:31.940 --> 3:13:36.580]  whatsoever and in fact cases rise quicker than other countries and other areas they just don't
[3:13:36.580 --> 3:13:42.980]  report on it he continues lockdowns have become central to any discussion of covid 19 the assumption
[3:13:42.980 --> 3:13:48.980]  that lockdown is the only way to prevent covid deaths has become embedded in mainstream thinking
[3:13:48.980 --> 3:13:56.100]  and also in polls as a result of media hysteria for example you get 75 percent of brits thinking
[3:13:56.100 --> 3:14:00.500]  that there need to be harsher lockdown measures despite the fact that the lockdowns we've already
[3:14:00.500 --> 3:14:05.780]  had have completely failed he continues apparently the only permitted questions are if we are
[3:14:05.780 --> 3:14:11.620]  locking down early enough hard enough or for long enough lockdown has similarly become the default
[3:14:11.620 --> 3:14:16.980]  response to rises in cases though sometimes these now take local rather than national form
[3:14:16.980 --> 3:14:22.420]  but the conventional wisdom that more lockdown means fewer deaths simply does not hold true in
[3:14:22.420 --> 3:14:31.060]  the real world there is globally no association let alone causation between lockdowns and covid
[3:14:31.060 --> 3:14:38.100]  deaths and he links while making those claims to the lancet and to frontiers international
[3:14:38.100 --> 3:14:46.100]  to mainstream scientific organizations proving that there is no correlation no association
[3:14:46.100 --> 3:14:53.220]  between lockdowns and reducing covid deaths that reality is in the official statistics and yet the
[3:14:53.220 --> 3:14:58.980]  entire narrative that we still labor under is that the only thing that can stop this is harsher
[3:14:58.980 --> 3:15:05.700]  and harsher lockdowns and he goes on to talk about the economic impacts and a lot more an excellent
[3:15:05.700 --> 3:15:10.980]  article at spyped.com and again they're talking about they're talking about even more intense
[3:15:10.980 --> 3:15:16.900]  lockdowns here in the UK we have this headline out of Sputnik UK facing near lockdown to avert
[3:15:16.900 --> 3:15:22.340]  catastrophe amid new phase of pandemic as warnings have been issued for the UK government to consider
[3:15:22.340 --> 3:15:28.660]  bringing in tighter coronavirus lockdown rules to avert a surging death we're already under lockdown
[3:15:28.660 --> 3:15:34.900]  how can it get even tighter everything's closed the shops are closed apart from the
[3:15:34.900 --> 3:15:40.660]  was depart from the massive transnational corporate retailers who are making vast profits
[3:15:41.220 --> 3:15:45.220]  while small businesses go to the wall those are the only shops that are open
[3:15:45.940 --> 3:15:51.460]  we're not allowed to see anyone the government permits us our daily exercise how is it different
[3:15:51.460 --> 3:15:56.260]  from any other lockdown how can it get worse how can it get more draconian
[3:15:57.300 --> 3:16:02.340]  Andrew Hayward a leading epidemiologist who sits on the government's new and emerging respiratory
[3:16:02.340 --> 3:16:09.140]  virus threats advisory group nerve tag told radio four of the urge to need to impose more tough
[3:16:09.140 --> 3:16:16.100]  restrictions he says tier four restrictions are likely to be necessary or even higher than that
[3:16:17.700 --> 3:16:23.140]  everybody's like most of the populations in tier four they can't see their friends they can't see
[3:16:23.140 --> 3:16:30.260]  their family they can't go anywhere apart from to buy groceries what is tier five
[3:16:30.260 --> 3:16:37.300]  so they're going to be drones circulating people's houses checking if they leave at the wrong time
[3:16:38.260 --> 3:16:43.540]  what can tier five and tier six be if tier four is already basically full lockdown
[3:16:44.980 --> 3:16:49.460]  professor Hayward is who's also the director of the usales institute for epidemiology
[3:16:49.460 --> 3:16:53.780]  added that the following situation suggested the country might be staring at a near lockdown
[3:16:53.780 --> 3:16:59.140]  as he advised lessons be learned from the first lockdown what is a near lockdown we're already
[3:16:59.140 --> 3:17:07.220]  in full lockdown tier four is full lockdown how can it get any more intense absolutely incredible
[3:17:08.260 --> 3:17:12.660]  meanwhile escape from verbi a hundreds of british tourists flee in the night after being
[3:17:12.660 --> 3:17:18.580]  forced to quarantine at swiss ski resort hotels so they retroactively said they needed to go under
[3:17:18.580 --> 3:17:25.140]  quarantine these brits on holiday in switzerland expected them to stay in their hotels for the
[3:17:25.140 --> 3:17:30.980]  next two weeks and not even leave and the response was hundreds of them just fled and went home so
[3:17:30.980 --> 3:17:36.100]  that's a good example of resistance against this insanity summit don't use don't go away
[3:17:37.860 --> 3:17:42.740]  it's not a secret why and leftist controlled cities all over the world not just the us
[3:17:42.740 --> 3:17:46.980]  they encourage people to live in tents cities is homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and
[3:17:46.980 --> 3:17:52.660]  engage in petty crime it's because the globalists admit under agenda 21 agenda 2030 of course the
[3:17:52.660 --> 3:17:58.420]  gray reset they want to lower expectations they don't want you to think of having sanitary systems
[3:17:58.420 --> 3:18:01.700]  everywhere they don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better they want you
[3:18:01.700 --> 3:18:06.660]  to think of civilization that gets progressively worse the globalists fly around in private jets
[3:18:06.660 --> 3:18:12.500]  they have huge private mistakes they are separate from us their children go to private tutors they
[3:18:12.500 --> 3:18:18.900]  admit this now they want us locked down telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually
[3:18:18.900 --> 3:18:24.340]  out physically building a pro-human infrastructure the infrastructure that's left under 5g is
[3:18:24.340 --> 3:18:29.780]  meant to control robot autonomous cars and trucks this is all their admitted plan the public's
[3:18:29.780 --> 3:18:34.660]  finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta it's gone operational it's a post human

[3:20:40.420 --> 3:20:43.060]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:43.060 --> 3:20:58.660]  live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:21:02.180 --> 3:21:06.420]  now i'm going to get into some of the uh little punishments that are being handed out to people
[3:21:06.420 --> 3:21:11.780]  in who refuse the vaccine in different countries also going to get into football fans refused
[3:21:11.780 --> 3:21:16.900]  entry without negative covid tests completely pointless what they're going to do start testing
[3:21:16.900 --> 3:21:22.500]  for every potential illness before allowing you in a venue that's coming but first we're
[3:21:22.500 --> 3:21:27.620]  going to go to this clip obviously in the last segment i talked about how lockdowns do not work
[3:21:27.620 --> 3:21:33.380]  it's proven that the countries the areas with the highest infection rates the most deaths
[3:21:33.380 --> 3:21:39.060]  belgium in particular and obviously california experiencing similar to that as well the countries
[3:21:39.060 --> 3:21:44.900]  with the most draconian mask mandates the most draconian lockdown mandates suffer the worst
[3:21:45.540 --> 3:21:51.940]  lockdowns don't work and then in regard to this clip our government many other governments
[3:21:51.940 --> 3:21:59.620]  refuse to release the statistics the studies on how many deaths lockdown itself is going to cause
[3:21:59.620 --> 3:22:05.460]  and indeed if that's going to cause eventually as many experts have said more deaths than the virus
[3:22:05.460 --> 3:22:12.180]  itself here's majeed nawaz on his radio show breaking this down let's roll the clip uh so
[3:22:12.180 --> 3:22:17.140]  throat clearing measure number one what i'm about to say is not covid denial it's lockdown
[3:22:17.140 --> 3:22:24.100]  skepticism throat clearing point number two vaccines are important this does not mean vaccines
[3:22:24.100 --> 3:22:28.980]  are not important it does not mean indeed that vaccines and when they are eventually rolled out
[3:22:28.980 --> 3:22:36.020]  will help with the herd immunity situation so again that's just out of the way before i am straw
[3:22:36.020 --> 3:22:40.980]  manned endlessly as as regularly seems to happen third point this does not mean what i'm about to
[3:22:40.980 --> 3:22:46.820]  say that all lives are not important every single life including my grandmother who passed away
[3:22:46.820 --> 3:22:51.220]  with covid off covid by covid through covid who knows because we're not being given those figures
[3:22:51.220 --> 3:22:55.860]  but every single life including my father who's shielding who hasn't seen his own grandchild
[3:22:55.860 --> 3:23:04.100]  um since even before right and through christmas every single life is important what i'm about to
[3:23:04.100 --> 3:23:08.500]  say does not mean i value one life over another now with that throat clearing out the way let
[3:23:08.500 --> 3:23:15.300]  me say the following lockdown kills it's as simple as that and that's what the data is telling us
[3:23:15.300 --> 3:23:20.340]  and i'll explain to you why the government according to the times and you can look this up
[3:23:20.340 --> 3:23:25.220]  has a dossier from the office for national statistics that tells them the data of what
[3:23:25.220 --> 3:23:29.860]  we're calling now an impact assessment that i had when i had the alternative sage member gabriel
[3:23:29.860 --> 3:23:34.180]  professor gable scally on it called me stupid for asking him a question that wasn't indeed stupid
[3:23:34.180 --> 3:23:38.660]  because a whole bunch of tory and backbench mps proceeded afterwards to demand this information
[3:23:38.660 --> 3:23:43.620]  of government and it's the following question how many people that by the way that clips on the lbc
[3:23:43.620 --> 3:23:47.620]  website you can check it out for yourselves it's actually quite interesting to watch because what
[3:23:47.620 --> 3:23:53.540]  he reveals himself to be is projecting stupidity onto a person asking him a question that he didn't
[3:23:53.540 --> 3:24:00.740]  know the answer to and the question is you're saying we need to save lives well okay how many
[3:24:00.740 --> 3:24:05.540]  lives will die through the lockdown measures compared to how many lives you will save through
[3:24:05.540 --> 3:24:12.180]  lockdown now that's a simple question that should be quite easy to respond to if your government
[3:24:12.180 --> 3:24:16.820]  because you have something called the office for national statistics which collects all of that
[3:24:16.820 --> 3:24:22.100]  data and when the backbench mps in the conservative party demanded that data from government the
[3:24:22.100 --> 3:24:27.860]  response was government refused to answer and didn't release the data the times then recently
[3:24:27.860 --> 3:24:32.660]  discovered that they do indeed have this information in a quote unquote secret dossier that they
[3:24:32.660 --> 3:24:39.940]  refuse to release and so it comes back down to that simple question do we know how many people
[3:24:39.940 --> 3:24:47.060]  would die because of lockdown compared to how many people will die if we do not lock down and if we
[3:24:47.060 --> 3:24:55.780]  don't know that answer then are we just grabbing trying to clutching at straws in the dark and the
[3:24:55.780 --> 3:25:01.060]  key thing here is actually that evidence hasn't been published by government and so anyone claiming
[3:25:01.060 --> 3:25:05.300]  that they follow experts and evidence has no right whatsoever and no basis to say they're following
[3:25:05.300 --> 3:25:09.540]  evidence that lockdown works because they haven't seen the evidence we now know the government
[3:25:09.540 --> 3:25:14.260]  refuses to publish the evidence as to whether lockdown kills more people than not locking down
[3:25:14.260 --> 3:25:18.900]  but i'll tell you who has published an impact assessment it's the only one available uh when
[3:25:18.900 --> 3:25:23.700]  it comes to this particular question of whether lockdowns work or not and that's professor philip
[3:25:23.700 --> 3:25:30.580]  thomas from bristol university now why is he important uh because he happens to have done
[3:25:30.580 --> 3:25:36.740]  an impact assessment on whether lockdown kills more people or not and it's the only one available
[3:25:36.740 --> 3:25:42.500]  so if you claim to follow evidence and data then what you should do is look at that evidence
[3:25:42.500 --> 3:25:47.860]  because there is no other evidence published on that question now his evidence and he's a professor
[3:25:47.860 --> 3:25:51.860]  of risk management at bristol so you kind of think you'd know what he's talking about when it comes
[3:25:51.860 --> 3:25:56.340]  to risks of certain actions being taken and modeling for those risks and what he said and
[3:25:56.340 --> 3:26:00.500]  i'll tell you exactly where it where you can find this it's an article by steven adams who's the
[3:26:00.500 --> 3:26:07.140]  medical editor for the mail on sunday and it was published uh on the 8th of november 2020 this year
[3:26:07.140 --> 3:26:12.900]  and what he says this is the headline lockdown will claim the equivalent of 560 000 lives because
[3:26:12.900 --> 3:26:18.820]  of the health impact of the deep and prolonged recession it will cause um he in his impact
[3:26:18.820 --> 3:26:25.220]  assessment covered covered exactly this question as to how many people die if we don't lockdown
[3:26:25.940 --> 3:26:31.460]  through covid and he said only 10 percent of the figure quote unquote only every death is too many
[3:26:31.460 --> 3:26:40.260]  only 10 percent of the figure of the total that will die because of lockdown 560 000 only 10 percent
[3:26:40.260 --> 3:26:45.700]  of that number will die through covid by the lockdown measures that are there to protect lives
[3:26:46.900 --> 3:26:52.660]  you have a 90 increase in death rates because of lockdown that's what that's what the only
[3:26:52.660 --> 3:26:58.500]  impact assessment ever done on this question and published is telling you so if you claim you're sick
[3:26:58.500 --> 3:27:04.260]  of people telling you don't listen to the experts as you talk about with brexitas and michael goes
[3:27:04.260 --> 3:27:10.340]  infamous interview then please please a don't straw man me when i give you this evidence and b
[3:27:11.140 --> 3:27:15.300]  practice what you preach and follow the evidence i am sick and tired of people saying one thing
[3:27:15.300 --> 3:27:19.540]  and doing another because it's literally killing people out there as the evidence is indicating
[3:27:19.540 --> 3:27:24.900]  to us and it's not just this 560 000 lives we're talking of because that's in britain then you
[3:27:24.900 --> 3:27:28.580]  look at what the head of the un said hundreds of thousands of children would die this year alone
[3:27:28.580 --> 3:27:35.620]  because of the economic harm of lockdown globally now if the evidence is telling us this then why
[3:27:35.620 --> 3:27:43.380]  oh why why is the public being scared and bumped into put into supporting another lockdown well
[3:27:43.380 --> 3:27:47.380]  another topic for another day and i promise you i will address this is the conflict of interests
[3:27:47.380 --> 3:27:52.420]  involved in those advocating lockdown now whether you talk about matt hancock and his mate a former
[3:27:52.420 --> 3:27:57.700]  pub landlord who got a multimillion pound contract for ppe never having provided pp to anyone before
[3:27:57.700 --> 3:28:02.900]  his expertise was running a pub right but his friend a pub landlord got multimillion pound
[3:28:02.900 --> 3:28:08.820]  contracts now whether it's that or whether it's wishy sunak's um uh uh hedge fund that he founded
[3:28:08.820 --> 3:28:13.940]  with the majority share in vaccine companies there are major conflicts of interest just go to the bmj
[3:28:13.940 --> 3:28:18.740]  the british medical journal look up camera and our basi the executive editor look up the editorial he
[3:28:18.740 --> 3:28:25.780]  wrote on this it is absolutely damning he's he uses the word criminal uh uh weaponization of science
[3:28:27.220 --> 3:28:31.860]  now don't blame me if you're not being told this stuff i am screaming from the rooftops about it
[3:28:31.860 --> 3:28:36.500]  every opportunity i've got but if you genuinely claim to believe in evidence and experts please
[3:28:36.500 --> 3:28:41.220]  look it up for yourselves and actually follow the evidence and i will put to you one challenge
[3:28:41.220 --> 3:28:49.380]  where is the evidence that lockdown saves more lives than not locking down
[3:28:50.260 --> 3:28:56.100]  and again this is never a discussion that has any place on sky news on bbc news there's no
[3:28:56.100 --> 3:29:00.340]  discussion of the fact that according to the studies that have taken place lockdown could end
[3:29:00.340 --> 3:29:08.260]  up killing at least 10 times more people than the virus itself of course now we move on to the
[3:29:08.260 --> 3:29:14.020]  punishments that are being handed out to people who are locked down skeptics in the main because
[3:29:14.020 --> 3:29:20.420]  they refuse to take a vaccine especially if you're healthy and have a 99.5 chance of surviving
[3:29:20.420 --> 3:29:24.500]  corona virus you're more likely to take your chances with that than take the vaccine
[3:29:25.060 --> 3:29:30.820]  headline out of rt spain to keep lists of people who refuse covid-19 vaccination and share data
[3:29:30.820 --> 3:29:35.780]  with european partners but they've promised it's going to remain private and you can trust them
[3:29:35.780 --> 3:29:41.140]  because there's never any scandals on data breaches regarding governments is there spain's
[3:29:41.140 --> 3:29:46.180]  health minister said authorities will keep a list of people who declined to get vaccinated
[3:29:46.180 --> 3:29:53.380]  and share it with other european countries so basically an interpol european wide database
[3:29:53.380 --> 3:29:58.900]  of vaccine refuse nicks oh but they're going to protect your privacy don't worry we will have
[3:29:58.900 --> 3:30:04.340]  a registry of people who have been offered the vaccine and have simply rejected it adding that
[3:30:04.340 --> 3:30:10.180]  the list will be shared with european partners he explained it would avoid confusion of why
[3:30:10.180 --> 3:30:16.580]  some people are not being vaccinated so basically in spain they're going to invite people one by one
[3:30:16.580 --> 3:30:22.500]  i guess by official government decree to take the vaccine and then create a database of everyone
[3:30:22.500 --> 3:30:28.340]  who refuses to do so and they're just going to keep that data and do nothing whatsoever with it
[3:30:28.340 --> 3:30:34.660]  and those people who refuse it won't be discriminated in the future at all you can trust them
[3:30:34.660 --> 3:30:41.140]  and trust them don't go away we'll be right back the year 2021 is almost here and so we're launching
[3:30:41.140 --> 3:30:45.860]  our new year's specials right now we've got two different big sales we've got supermobile

[3:32:01.940 --> 3:32:07.460]  and control and that they're not even worried about covid-19 that's what claus swan with others
[3:32:07.460 --> 3:32:12.420]  have said think about how insane that is oh and big tech's got to track you they've got to trace you

[3:32:22.500 --> 3:32:28.660]  give your ability to cancer or heart attack this is their takeover imagine on america's
[3:32:28.660 --> 3:32:34.100]  death certificate killed by the fear of the common cold yeah that's fear monitoring that's mind
[3:32:34.100 --> 3:32:42.500]  control we are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare the united nations the
[3:32:42.500 --> 3:32:46.980]  big corporations the globalists big tech and big pharma are all pushing the coven's most deadly
[3:32:46.980 --> 3:32:52.820]  thing in history even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold but if you are deficient
[3:32:52.820 --> 3:32:56.820]  then you can actually die from it that's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes
[3:32:56.820 --> 3:33:01.860]  meanwhile all these top scientists and and researchers and former phyzer head medical
[3:33:01.860 --> 3:33:07.220]  officers have come out and said that the coven 19 vaccine especially mRNA ones are basically
[3:33:07.220 --> 3:33:12.100]  bio weapons that are super deadly and now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically
[3:33:12.100 --> 3:33:16.420]  when they take it just like newborn babies they give vaccines they have to resuscitate them all
[3:33:16.420 --> 3:33:20.740]  the time or a lot of times they just let them die and that's on the record it does that geon
[3:33:20.740 --> 3:33:25.460]  berets narcolepsy cancer all these other diseases but they tell you save and effective no one's
[3:33:25.460 --> 3:33:30.660]  getting hurt it's a conspiracy theory and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly
[3:33:30.660 --> 3:33:34.420]  so they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous
[3:33:34.420 --> 3:33:40.740]  because the media says it's safe they do it you must guard your humanity you must guard your
[3:33:40.740 --> 3:33:46.180]  children's humanity you must guard the very genetic code of the planet the globalists have set
[3:33:46.180 --> 3:33:51.140]  themselves up as the guardians of this world but they are the ones that are overriding every
[3:33:51.140 --> 3:33:56.900]  genetic system poisoning the planet they are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover
[3:33:56.900 --> 3:34:02.980]  of every human on earth to the GMO crops and now they've moved on to their main target
[3:34:03.620 --> 3:34:09.540]  to mad at me with the mRNA vaccines which are not vaccines they are recombinant DNA
[3:34:10.500 --> 3:34:18.020]  from aborted cloned fetuses were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's
[3:34:18.020 --> 3:34:25.460]  symptoms go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned
[3:34:25.460 --> 3:34:30.420]  this is the equivalent of an alien takeover whether it's interdimensional whether it's
[3:34:30.420 --> 3:34:34.580]  little green men the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and over

[3:36:28.660 --> 3:36:35.220]  vaccination in a database basically to spy on them the government in the uk have said that
[3:36:36.020 --> 3:36:40.660]  they're not going to make it mandatory but then we've had all these venues we've had ticket master
[3:36:41.220 --> 3:36:46.980]  and others suggesting that they would make taking the vaccine mandatory as a means of
[3:36:46.980 --> 3:36:52.420]  basically engaging in custom with you now we have this headline football fans refused entry
[3:36:52.420 --> 3:36:58.260]  without negative covid tests football fans in liverpool uk have been mandated to take covid
[3:36:58.260 --> 3:37:03.620]  tests before attending a match those who do not will be refused entry even if they have bought
[3:37:03.620 --> 3:37:09.220]  tickets fans of everton fc were warned by the club that they must produce negative test results
[3:37:09.220 --> 3:37:14.340]  issued no more than 36 hours previously will be barred from entering the stadium to see the team
[3:37:14.340 --> 3:37:20.900]  play against manchester city now the irony of this was that the game was cancelled four hours before
[3:37:21.540 --> 3:37:27.220]  because manchester city claimed that some of their players had tested positive for covid
[3:37:27.220 --> 3:37:34.180]  by the way these covid tests which i almost had to get one simply to leave the country turned out
[3:37:34.180 --> 3:37:39.540]  to be fruitless because they banned everyone from leaving the country set up internal borders while
[3:37:39.540 --> 3:37:46.580]  keeping the external borders wide open in some cases they can cost 100 and 150 pounds now people
[3:37:46.580 --> 3:37:52.500]  have already had their holiday christmas plans ruined they're not getting refunded by the airlines
[3:37:52.500 --> 3:37:59.140]  now they're having to fork out a not insignificant amount of money to get a negative covid test
[3:37:59.140 --> 3:38:05.620]  simply to go and see a football match and you can bet your bottom dollar if these great reset
[3:38:05.620 --> 3:38:11.380]  globalists get their way this will ultimately be the vaccine the vaccine passport which we've
[3:38:11.380 --> 3:38:16.820]  talked about will not just be used for travel it will be used for basically engaging in any kind
[3:38:16.820 --> 3:38:22.980]  of entertainment or social life unless we resist it and they're going to get hit in the pocket by
[3:38:22.980 --> 3:38:27.940]  the way because the polls show that about 40 percent of the population isn't going to take
[3:38:27.940 --> 3:38:33.780]  the vaccine so you're going to lose 40 percent of your custom you look with that there's live a
[3:38:33.780 --> 3:38:37.460]  pool as thus far escaped complete lockdown like much of the rest of the country and therefore
[3:38:37.460 --> 3:38:42.660]  some sports fans are allowed to attend events several fans pointed out that the tests are
[3:38:42.660 --> 3:38:48.660]  highly inaccurate that's why we've got so many positive cases because these PCR tests produce
[3:38:48.660 --> 3:38:54.180]  so many false positives and that a negative result from a day or two ago means little
[3:38:55.540 --> 3:39:00.100]  someone responded to Everton FC on twitter using lateral flow tests with 50 percent
[3:39:00.100 --> 3:39:05.140]  accuracy you'd be as well asking them to guess heads or tails correctly to gain entrance
[3:39:06.420 --> 3:39:11.460]  someone else said well utter BS I could have a negative test and then contract it five minutes
[3:39:11.460 --> 3:39:18.100]  later when I touch a surface then my face it's a complete false another twitter user responded
[3:39:18.100 --> 3:39:24.020]  by saying can you please list all the other illnesses asymptomatic aka healthy fans should
[3:39:24.020 --> 3:39:31.620]  be tested for TB polio the flu again completely pointless it's a completely empty gesture but
[3:39:31.620 --> 3:39:37.300]  it's about making people submit to any directive and it's about creating the precedent for people
[3:39:37.300 --> 3:39:44.100]  having to take the vaccine to engage in any kind of social life whatsoever and on that same subject
[3:39:45.140 --> 3:39:50.660]  report travel insurers likely to make vaccination a requirement yet another sector of the travel
[3:39:50.660 --> 3:39:54.180]  industry has signaled that it could mandate vaccination against coronavirus to provide
[3:39:54.180 --> 3:39:59.620]  services to travelers according to a report that notes insurers may demand to see proof of
[3:39:59.620 --> 3:40:05.860]  vaccination before covering those wish to go on holiday so not only have the airlines some of
[3:40:05.860 --> 3:40:11.220]  them at least come out and said that they're going to require vaccination passports which by the UK
[3:40:11.220 --> 3:40:15.780]  by the way the UK government is now developing having lied to us and say they said they wouldn't
[3:40:15.780 --> 3:40:23.940]  come now insurers as well as airlines are talking about mandating a covid vaccination because we
[3:40:23.940 --> 3:40:30.020]  had another article a couple of weeks ago where hotels were starting to talk about maybe they
[3:40:30.020 --> 3:40:36.100]  should ask for proof that you had the vaccination before allowing you to stay out of France we
[3:40:36.100 --> 3:40:42.020]  had the proposal where public transport operators would require proof of vaccination that was
[3:40:42.020 --> 3:40:47.140]  thankfully shot down and most of this is unenforceable and that that's what goes in our favour
[3:40:47.780 --> 3:40:52.660]  the fact that there are so many people especially when you think about trains and people piling
[3:40:52.660 --> 3:40:59.380]  onto trains and buses how is that operationally going to work where each person has to prove
[3:40:59.380 --> 3:41:05.140]  that they've been vaccinated meanwhile if you live in Australia you can't kiss or hug anyone on
[3:41:05.140 --> 3:41:10.100]  New Year's Eve according to the government Australian authorities ban New Year's Eve kissing
[3:41:10.100 --> 3:41:16.420]  and hugging to stop covid again totally unenforceable it's just about them creating the precedent to
[3:41:16.420 --> 3:41:22.820]  micro manage your personal behaviour it's about the threat of it not the actual enforcement of it
[3:41:22.820 --> 3:41:30.180]  it's about enlisting compliance authorities in Victoria Australia have banned kissing and hugging
[3:41:30.180 --> 3:41:36.420]  on New Year's Eve but there have been no new cases of covid 19 in two months the Victorian
[3:41:36.420 --> 3:41:40.340]  government said just as Christmas was a little different this year New Year's Eve will be two
[3:41:40.980 --> 3:41:45.860]  don't share drinks with others kisses and hugs should only be shared with those in your immediate
[3:41:45.860 --> 3:41:53.380]  family again completely unenforceable what is enforceable though is this a headline out of
[3:41:53.380 --> 3:41:59.140]  zero hedge organizer of London anti lockdown protest could be fine 10 000 pounds obviously this
[3:41:59.140 --> 3:42:04.900]  is a massive disincentive that they put out there to prevent people from organising the organiser
[3:42:04.900 --> 3:42:10.980]  of an anti lockdown protest in London is facing a prospect of a 10 000 pound fine the Matt police
[3:42:10.980 --> 3:42:15.140]  said on Monday of course if you say you're protesting for black lives matter they'll bow down
[3:42:15.140 --> 3:42:20.580]  and kiss your feet but if you're an anti lockdown protester they'll find you 10 grand and they'll
[3:42:20.580 --> 3:42:26.900]  arrest you on the spot just like they did Piers Corbyn the Matt said the officers were called
[3:42:26.900 --> 3:42:30.980]  on Sunday afternoon to find about 100 people gathering in Southwark and what appeared to be a
[3:42:30.980 --> 3:42:37.700]  pre planned protest acting inspector David Smith said this sort of gathering is specifically
[3:42:37.700 --> 3:42:42.900]  prohibited under tier tier four restrictions brought in following the recent rapid rise of
[3:42:42.900 --> 3:42:49.940]  cases again if they'd taken a cardboard placard that said BLM on it they would have been worshipped
[3:42:49.940 --> 3:43:00.500]  as saints moving on football club demands fans who booed BLM undergo re-education courses before
[3:43:00.500 --> 3:43:05.780]  being allowed back now of course they were always going to have this problem when they allowed fans
[3:43:05.780 --> 3:43:11.780]  back into the stadiums after completely banning them during lockdown because Premier League
[3:43:11.780 --> 3:43:17.380]  football is some of the same ones by the way who have sponsorships deals with Nike which literally
[3:43:17.380 --> 3:43:25.940]  traffics in slave labour from China oh but they're so woke they take a knee still god knows why
[3:43:25.940 --> 3:43:32.740]  what six months after the George Floyd incident they're still taking a knee when the referee blows
[3:43:32.740 --> 3:43:39.460]  the whistle at kickoff again George Floyd happened 2000 miles away in a different country there's
[3:43:39.460 --> 3:43:45.620]  literally been like one police killing of a black person unfairly over the past 20 years in the UK
[3:43:46.180 --> 3:43:52.260]  but all these multi-millionaires have to kneel before every game they have massive banners in
[3:43:52.260 --> 3:43:59.460]  the stands where all these empty seats are saying BLM on Sky Sports the football broadcaster
[3:44:00.340 --> 3:44:06.980]  they flash up BLM as a graphic at the top of the screen during every game it's getting a bit
[3:44:06.980 --> 3:44:12.660]  insidious but now Cambridge United Football Club is demanding fans who booed players taking a knee
[3:44:12.660 --> 3:44:20.660]  for BLM undergo re-education lessons or face a stadium ban after a handful of fans voiced their
[3:44:20.660 --> 3:44:24.820]  displeasure before a December 15 game against Colchester the club reacted by launching an
[3:44:24.820 --> 3:44:30.660]  investigation and then they said that anybody who basically refuses to undergo this diversity
[3:44:30.660 --> 3:44:36.660]  re-education is not going to be allowed back into the stadium now this controversy started
[3:44:36.660 --> 3:44:43.140]  a couple of weeks prior to that in the first instance of fans booing players and this happened
[3:44:43.140 --> 3:44:50.580]  at a Millwall game by the way Millwall's twice star player of the year who was voted for by fans
[3:44:50.580 --> 3:44:57.780]  is black but apparently because they're booing Black Lives Matter a marxist violent revolutionary
[3:44:57.780 --> 3:45:03.940]  movement that means they hate black people well now it probably has something to do with the fact
[3:45:03.940 --> 3:45:10.260]  that BLM rioters over the past six months in the UK have desecrated war memorials set fire to the
[3:45:10.260 --> 3:45:16.020]  union jack flag vandalize the Winston Churchill monument and violently attacked police that's
[3:45:16.020 --> 3:45:21.700]  probably why they're getting booed by fans when they take a knee for that organization that's
[3:45:21.700 --> 3:45:28.260]  going to wrap it up war room is coming up next coming up news always mountain patriot in Colorado
[3:45:28.260 --> 3:45:33.060]  thank you for holding how you doing Alex man i'm just working as hard as i can we're in such a
[3:45:33.060 --> 3:45:39.380]  critical time brother how are you i love you man i want to uh make a quick plug that dna force i love
[3:45:39.380 --> 3:45:44.100]  it i've been using it quite a while and i just went looked at the ingredients again the other day
[3:45:44.100 --> 3:45:50.500]  and i see that it contains quercetin which according to some published studies that dr
[3:45:50.500 --> 3:45:57.780]  mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the
[3:45:57.780 --> 3:46:03.620]  zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look at that the all i know is with dna force
[3:46:03.620 --> 3:46:09.060]  we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't
[3:46:09.060 --> 3:46:13.060]  prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive products
[3:46:13.060 --> 3:46:17.700]  and it was really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands
[3:46:17.700 --> 3:46:21.460]  together and that's what produced this so thanks thanks for the plug
[3:46:21.460 --> 3:46:28.740]  the plug
[3:46:28.740 --> 3:46:32.260]  anybody listening to my voice simply searchings in the term
[3:46:32.260 --> 3:46:39.540]  devos group technocracy we're technocrats you will get claus schwaab and john codd
[3:46:39.540 --> 3:46:46.900]  yunker and all the new order globalists like ggp saying that they no longer want elected leaders
[3:46:46.900 --> 3:46:52.340]  over governments but they want businessman technocrats over it and that's who claus schwaab
[3:46:52.340 --> 3:46:57.140]  is you might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the covet 19 lockdowns to bankruptcy
[3:46:57.140 --> 3:47:02.500]  and make you poor you might want to find out who this super villain is you see he believes because
[3:47:02.500 --> 3:47:07.220]  he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it that he has a right to do it to you
[3:47:07.220 --> 3:47:12.100]  you might want to find who he works for he works directly for prince charles he developed since the
[3:47:12.100 --> 3:47:18.260]  eighties the plan for global sustainability that means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works
[3:47:18.260 --> 3:47:22.900]  so you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take
[3:47:22.900 --> 3:47:26.420]  those shots you might just want to find out who this villain is all right
[3:47:26.420 --> 3:47:39.220]  you're listening to the alex jones show
