[08:17.420 --> 08:23.700]  into the jet debauging palphe murdler and how it's unraveling and we'll also be
[08:23.700 --> 08:28.460]  taking your phone calls in the second third and fourth hour today we do have
[08:28.460 --> 08:32.620]  Karen Johnson state senator Arizona exposing the fact that 9-11's an inside
[08:32.620 --> 08:38.180]  job popping in coming up in about 30 minutes but let me move quickly now with
[08:38.180 --> 08:43.860]  the news that I have in front of me that we need to cover on the debit gene
[08:43.860 --> 08:50.500]  at palphe front headline on prisonplanet.com 9-11 conspiracy connection to
[08:50.500 --> 08:56.220]  DC madam murder palphe told former NSA official that call girls had picked up
[08:56.220 --> 09:02.260]  information concerning for knowledge of attacks now palphe did act like a spy did
[09:02.260 --> 09:07.300]  behave like one fit the MO completely didn't embellish or add any info in
[09:07.300 --> 09:12.220]  fact was pretty close-lipped but she did admit that she believed their
[09:12.220 --> 09:17.220]  operation was being used as a hunting ground to collect data on high level
[09:17.220 --> 09:20.820]  military officers members of the Congress and others and then unbeknownst to
[09:20.820 --> 09:27.020]  her that info was being used in blackmail them well who knows if that's
[09:27.020 --> 09:32.540]  really the truth I tend to not believe that and what I do believe is what we're
[09:32.540 --> 09:36.860]  being told by Wayne Madsen who of course was with naval intelligence to an
[09:36.860 --> 09:42.260]  analyst with the national security agency who runs Wayne Madsen report.com
[09:42.260 --> 09:48.300]  he had met with her and her lawyer several times right before she died just
[09:48.300 --> 09:53.780]  the last month when she was last in DC and she told him she said you know this
[09:53.780 --> 09:58.220]  also could be about 9-11 and quote warnings beforehand that was some of
[09:58.220 --> 10:03.500]  the chatter because these old guys you know like to brag like to you know that's
[10:03.500 --> 10:07.540]  the MO they like to when they get drunk or on drugs to shoot their mouth off in
[10:07.540 --> 10:11.700]  front of these women though most these women were college students or college
[10:11.700 --> 10:16.820]  professors which is why the MO of the girl she ran was not the normal BEMBO
[10:16.820 --> 10:20.740]  MO these were girls there in Virginia there in McLean Virginia there in
[10:20.740 --> 10:26.740]  Maryland in and around the CIA who were professors and people give me a break
[10:26.740 --> 10:32.460]  they were spooks big time and Palfrey basically admitted that here on air and
[10:32.460 --> 10:37.060]  now we're hearing there's a 9-11 connection because I mean you can have
[10:37.060 --> 10:41.820]  thousands of visits by gay porn stars at midnight at the White House and that gets
[10:41.820 --> 10:47.140]  swept under the rug you can have you know literally it's what it's about half
[10:47.140 --> 10:51.820]  the Homeland Security state heads have been caught engaging pedophilia you've
[10:51.820 --> 10:56.060]  got to be in that club be part of that so this just old-fashioned the ones that
[10:56.060 --> 11:00.900]  happen to like women like Cheney and McCain and Bill Clinton I mean this is
[11:00.900 --> 11:04.780]  not that big of a deal in fact you got to the point where Clinton doesn't even
[11:04.780 --> 11:08.860]  have to whack women anymore that you know that speak up because it's just it's
[11:08.860 --> 11:16.260]  just so accepted unless there was something else being covered up but what
[11:16.260 --> 11:22.900]  we do know is that she told her landlord this came out over the weekend who she
[11:22.900 --> 11:26.860]  was friends with well by landlord he managed the condos where she lived she
[11:26.860 --> 11:31.180]  owned her condo but she was making sure that her six years was paid she was
[11:31.180 --> 11:34.760]  told she was gonna be going you know on average in about six years for the
[11:34.760 --> 11:37.820]  convictions that she got in fact that would be a steep sentence the average
[11:37.820 --> 11:41.660]  would be about two years so she was looking at about six years she said but
[11:41.660 --> 11:45.260]  there are guys following me I've got this box of evidence to protect me I
[11:45.260 --> 11:49.460]  think there's a contract out on me at the end she kind of started getting the
[11:49.460 --> 11:54.740]  idea could feel the wings of the angel of death flapping about her head she
[11:54.740 --> 11:57.780]  told her mother she wasn't gonna kill herself that she was gonna fight she
[11:57.780 --> 12:05.020]  was upbeat toughest nails operative big-time folks it just goes on and on it
[12:05.020 --> 12:11.420]  just goes on and on and on and on a staple of intelligence is hookers it is
[12:11.420 --> 12:17.180]  a staple because you can again compromise people blackmail people buy
[12:17.180 --> 12:23.860]  people that's how they get close to you not just hookers to you know super good
[12:23.860 --> 12:27.500]  looking women popping out of the sky wanting to you know go have a cup of
[12:27.500 --> 12:32.540]  coffee with you I'm told that happens to a lot of people who the government's
[12:32.540 --> 12:36.860]  trying to infiltrate not saying it's ever happened to me but the point here is
[12:36.860 --> 12:45.700]  watch your six anybody out there from this now that said you need to go up to
[12:45.700 --> 12:48.540]  prison planet dot com and read this story we're gonna be covering it more in
[12:48.540 --> 12:54.580]  detail in the second hour I'll even get Ellen watch take on it the another
[12:54.580 --> 12:58.580]  question I've gotten I mean I've gotten hundreds of emails hundreds of message
[12:58.580 --> 13:03.220]  board comments asking me you know how on earth at a raldo Rivera have you on well
[13:03.220 --> 13:07.980]  I can tell you quite a bit I got a call Thursday when they murdered her and we
[13:07.980 --> 13:12.340]  had a you know our clips on the web of past interviews with her saying no I'll
[13:12.340 --> 13:17.300]  never kill myself I'll never commit suicide and Fox News has set me up six
[13:17.300 --> 13:21.460]  seven eight times I forget for interviews and always cancelled me that's why
[13:21.460 --> 13:24.900]  when they called me last year and so we want to fly to New York to be in a
[13:24.900 --> 13:30.540]  special I said no and they said please will we'll even pay you and I said no
[13:30.540 --> 13:34.580]  and I said because you cancelled me every time and I'm certainly not gonna
[13:34.580 --> 13:38.460]  get on an airplane I mean I've been in the car going down to the satellite
[13:38.460 --> 13:42.140]  uplink here in Austin you know they send they always send a car to get you so
[13:42.140 --> 13:46.700]  they have you in their clutches to make sure you get there on time and then
[13:46.700 --> 13:52.700]  they've turned back and told me oh it's cancelled and I said no so I sent Kevin
[13:52.700 --> 13:57.300]  Smith who was my producer about a year ago I sent him he got on a plane flew
[13:57.300 --> 14:03.980]  there and got there and it really went on Fox so I thought well so this time I
[14:03.980 --> 14:08.820]  said okay sure I'll be there Saturday night if you want me so they come pick
[14:08.820 --> 14:12.700]  me up at the office drive down to Congress go do the interview couldn't
[14:12.700 --> 14:15.900]  believe it but but they also told me her all those producer oh yeah we know who
[14:15.900 --> 14:20.740]  you are I said you know who I am I said I got arrested six months ago bullhorning
[14:20.740 --> 14:27.140]  Geraldo he was flipping us off he goes I know Geraldo knows who you are and he
[14:27.140 --> 14:31.100]  wants to have you on you're the guy that got the interview and I said come on is
[14:31.100 --> 14:35.180]  this a sneak attack he said no Geraldo thinks it's suspicious well then
[14:35.180 --> 14:38.860]  Geraldo went on Thursday night and said Saturday I'll be covering this on
[14:38.860 --> 14:44.620]  Geraldo at large and there's some evidence that she was murdered he goes
[14:44.620 --> 14:48.500]  on agrees with me that she's probably murdered calls for an investigation by
[14:48.500 --> 14:53.940]  the governor has a former federal judge on and a former federal prosecutor on
[14:53.940 --> 14:59.180]  saying that they think she was murdered and they all agree with me he did intro
[14:59.180 --> 15:03.100]  it as I'm a conspiracy theorist and you know there's this one guy who she
[15:03.100 --> 15:06.860]  supposedly called this crime writer and she said oh I'll kill myself before I go
[15:06.860 --> 15:14.140]  to jail so they did put some spin in the intro but not in the main body of the
[15:14.140 --> 15:18.060]  five-minute to six-minute piece that we had it was well as part of two pieces
[15:18.060 --> 15:22.540]  about six minutes so you can go watch that up on info wars dot com or prison
[15:22.540 --> 15:27.420]  planet dot com the YouTube clip of that it's the whole two pieces together the
[15:27.420 --> 15:33.340]  two segments but some people are saying I shouldn't have gone on Fox I've said
[15:33.340 --> 15:38.100]  I'll go anywhere anytime anyplace and then when I refused to go on Fox a year
[15:38.100 --> 15:43.100]  ago I got called a chicken but that was after five six times I don't know it was
[15:43.100 --> 15:47.260]  a bunch of times them canceling I thought I'd fly there for no reason I
[15:47.260 --> 15:51.620]  thought it was a sick Fox news joke I didn't make Kevin go I said if you want
[15:51.620 --> 15:57.580]  to go you can go but I said if not it's canceled he said oh no I want to go so I
[15:57.580 --> 16:03.060]  said okay go ahead and go then and then he was on TV and that we go like a ten
[16:03.060 --> 16:07.540]  minute segment two segments I was well worth it to go talk to you know three
[16:07.540 --> 16:15.980]  million people that's about their average viewership is so because again it
[16:15.980 --> 16:19.860]  was me should I've driven 15 minutes knowing they could cancel it I was
[16:19.860 --> 16:25.740]  willing to do it should I've gone on of course I should have gone on judge the
[16:25.740 --> 16:32.620]  tree by its fruits I went on the show and we expose that she was murdered and
[16:32.620 --> 16:36.900]  believe me I got chills up now my spine I was talking about it I almost came out
[16:36.900 --> 16:45.300]  and say it said Wayne Madsen says that she was servicing Dick Cheney and that
[16:45.300 --> 16:49.540]  her girls were servicing Dick Cheney and of the Brandy Britain was that's why
[16:49.540 --> 16:55.380]  they killed her hung her to and women don't hang themselves and I almost you
[16:55.380 --> 16:58.380]  know throughout the McCain thing in fact I was gonna do it early on but I
[16:58.380 --> 17:02.580]  decided to convince them first and go over all the admitted evidence then I
[17:02.580 --> 17:08.900]  was gonna drop that bombshell there at the end but the segment ended but it's
[17:08.900 --> 17:12.660]  easy to talk the talk if you walk the walk I mean have you gone on national
[17:12.660 --> 17:16.140]  television and said the government's killing people have you gone on CNN and
[17:16.140 --> 17:20.700]  said the government carried out 9-11 I mean have you done that walk a mile in
[17:20.700 --> 17:24.500]  my shoes because people also e-mail me saying you should have said this you
[17:24.500 --> 17:28.260]  should have said that you try when three people are interrupting you to get
[17:28.260 --> 17:35.160]  anything out edgewise I did though get it out and I did a slam dunk thank God
[17:35.160 --> 17:41.940]  for the guidance and this is serious business but I'll tell you who's in
[17:41.940 --> 17:45.780]  danger and it's Wayne Madsen because what he's saying checks out this time he
[17:45.780 --> 17:49.300]  he named the lawyer it was a civil forfeiture lawyer and he named the
[17:49.300 --> 17:55.260]  dinners he had and I believe him and I can tell his he was hesitating I know
[17:55.260 --> 17:58.940]  how to gauge people he was a little freaked out when I talked to him Sunday
[17:58.940 --> 18:05.380]  morning and Madsen's for real and my gut my instincts tell me you know with the
[18:05.380 --> 18:10.180]  whole things well he basically said it he said he said I'm good government good
[18:10.180 --> 18:14.220]  section of the intelligence agencies trying to stop them from going

[24:17.340 --> 24:21.860]  courthouse the sealed off yesterday after an explosion San Diego federal
[24:21.860 --> 24:27.900]  courthouse is closed Monday today so repairs can be made after a pipe bomb
[24:27.900 --> 24:34.700]  exploded early Sunday the powerful blast that shattered a window a lot of a
[24:34.700 --> 24:40.140]  hype it wrecked the building's front entrance in the lobby area when that
[24:40.140 --> 24:44.460]  yeah spokesman said fortunately the explosion at Edward at J Swartz federal
[24:44.460 --> 24:50.620]  courthouse which occurred at 1 40 a.m. had no victims okay we're doing an
[24:50.620 --> 24:54.220]  article on this the Israelis the British and the US have all been caught
[24:54.220 --> 24:59.700]  admittedly staging bombing attacks on their front doors many times in the past
[24:59.700 --> 25:04.980]  and later admitting that they did it to quote increased security the last time
[25:04.980 --> 25:07.980]  they admitted they did it was just a few years ago in London the Israelis
[25:07.980 --> 25:11.900]  bombed their own embassy they said to make the British take their security
[25:11.900 --> 25:18.740]  more serious and give them more support in the street more police and notice
[25:18.740 --> 25:25.100]  this happened during a FEMA drill nationwide it's ongoing from the first
[25:25.100 --> 25:31.340]  until the 8th and they always bomb themselves during drills that way if
[25:31.340 --> 25:37.380]  the officer caught planting the bomb BATF tends to be who they used to bomb
[25:37.380 --> 25:41.060]  things at least with Oklahoma City we know they train with a rider truck a
[25:41.060 --> 25:47.220]  few months before tested bombs out in the desert time and time again these BATF
[25:47.220 --> 25:51.180]  is their bomb people because they're one of the most criminal groups sometimes
[25:51.180 --> 25:55.980]  they use actual military assets who've been a sheep dipped into intelligence but
[25:55.980 --> 26:01.540]  that's who I'd be looking at for these bombings both in Times Square I just go
[26:01.540 --> 26:05.300]  to who's done it in the same signature then they get to grandstand because
[26:05.300 --> 26:11.660]  there's no real terrorism it doesn't exist it's like a leprechaun or a unicorn
[26:11.660 --> 26:16.500]  or a chubacabra it doesn't happen outside people's imagination at least in
[26:16.500 --> 26:19.460]  the West there's a few real stabbings real bombings in the Middle East most of
[26:19.460 --> 26:22.860]  those are provocative to according to Herod's and Jerusalem post of the
[26:22.860 --> 26:25.620]  Israelis admit they staged most the attacks every time there's about to be
[26:25.620 --> 26:30.020]  a peace deal no one ever really sees a suicide bomber they just put a bomb on
[26:30.020 --> 26:36.220]  a bus and killed 50 people and then run around grandstanding but it's I mean
[26:36.220 --> 26:42.420]  it's the same thing over and over and over and over again and we got to give
[26:42.420 --> 26:45.140]  up our way alive we got to give up all of our freedoms give up all of our
[26:45.140 --> 26:49.500]  liberties they're talking about cities all over the country buying billions of
[26:49.500 --> 26:54.380]  dollars of terror insurance which is a payoff to the insurance companies for
[26:54.380 --> 26:59.420]  imaginary terror that'll never happen and you're gonna pay for that taxpayers
[26:59.420 --> 27:04.220]  now when somebody takes it out on a building though Larry Silverstein's
[27:04.220 --> 27:07.740]  bought the Sears Tower and taken out massive insurance that does make it a
[27:07.740 --> 27:13.500]  target County considers terror insurance it's cheap compared to other coverage
[27:13.500 --> 27:17.700]  because it's imaginary the actuaries on that or I would imagine the chances of
[27:17.700 --> 27:22.660]  an asteroid hitting along with the property wind and liability insurance
[27:22.660 --> 27:26.620]  Jackson County leaders will look Monday that terrorism insurance coverage on the
[27:26.620 --> 27:30.880]  county's 100 buildings it's relatively cheap we will definitely consider it said
[27:30.880 --> 27:33.980]  board of supervisors president John McKay it's cheaper than earthquake
[27:33.980 --> 27:38.340]  insurance yeah because earthquakes actually happen though not frequently in
[27:38.340 --> 27:42.340]  your area earthquake coverage was something the board kicked around before
[27:42.340 --> 27:45.700]  decided not to sign on because no matter how cheap it is there needs to be a
[27:45.700 --> 27:49.540]  certain amount of risk to make it worthwhile County leaders have said
[27:49.540 --> 27:54.420]  but if something ever seen happens and somewhere blew up the courthouse you're
[27:54.420 --> 27:58.820]  going who are who's gonna pay for it I said you got to love this man you got to
[27:58.820 --> 28:04.860]  love it you got to love it you got to love them by the way a judge has ruled
[28:04.860 --> 28:08.940]  that coroners and medical doctors are not allowed to say that tasers kill
[28:08.940 --> 28:17.980]  people that's right judges now they practice medicine and you can't make
[28:17.980 --> 28:23.020]  stuff up like this judge rules for taser cause of death decisions the judge
[28:23.020 --> 28:29.060]  decides it tasers now said they will sue the hundreds of doctors and medical
[28:29.060 --> 28:34.220]  examiners who say that tasers cause heart attacks now when one counting three
[28:34.220 --> 28:37.940]  people reportedly died after being tasered course and nothing to do with
[28:37.940 --> 28:42.900]  the taser they were just tasered and died and the judge has ordered the judge
[28:42.900 --> 28:47.020]  obviously in the hip pocket there taser international has fired a warning shot
[28:47.020 --> 28:51.100]  at medical examiners across the country that's right this is the new america
[28:51.100 --> 28:58.060]  where where the judge says so when your son or daughter or you die from a taser
[28:58.060 --> 29:02.220]  and they've had a few cops died during taser test taser didn't kill you you're
[29:02.220 --> 29:06.820]  alive before they tell you it's just incredible big federal report out big
[29:06.820 --> 29:10.380]  international report admitting incubators are frying babies I mean
[29:10.380 --> 29:13.860]  literally more than half the kids that were in an incubator open and shut
[29:13.860 --> 29:17.900]  tested it's hurting them bad they're not gonna stop a judge will just say you're
[29:17.900 --> 29:24.380]  not allowed to stop it's a new level of corruption the Scottsdale base stun gun
[29:24.380 --> 29:27.940]  manufacturer increasingly has targeted state and county medical examiners with
[29:27.940 --> 29:31.740]  lawsuits and lobbying efforts to reverse and prevent medical rulings that
[29:31.740 --> 29:35.620]  tasers contributed to someone's death that's right you don't like a ruling just
[29:35.620 --> 29:48.740]  sue him be right back we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and

[31:57.780 --> 32:00.660]  government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be
[32:00.660 --> 32:04.620]  the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years for the last three
[32:04.620 --> 32:07.980]  years the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce and it
[32:07.980 --> 32:11.540]  has now finally caught up with us in the US commodities such as flour and rice
[32:11.540 --> 32:14.740]  are already being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another
[32:14.740 --> 32:18.620]  four to five months it's fall in the southern hemisphere and many countries
[32:18.620 --> 32:21.260]  are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped
[32:21.260 --> 32:24.980]  exporting certain commodities altogether remember our trade deficit
[32:24.980 --> 32:28.500]  trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing
[32:28.500 --> 32:32.820]  in to buy our food production at any price by late summer if not early fall
[32:32.820 --> 32:36.420]  it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under

[33:05.020 --> 33:11.460]  just finishing up my comment on this taser situation you don't like what
[33:11.460 --> 33:16.020]  coroners and medical examiners and doctors are saying you just sue them oh
[33:16.020 --> 33:21.540]  you're saying my taser killed this guy oh three people in the county died when
[33:21.540 --> 33:27.460]  they were tasered it has nothing to do with that no see they were struck by
[33:27.460 --> 33:34.500]  lightning right after being tasered the lightning killed them not the 50,000
[33:34.500 --> 33:43.940]  volts so from now on I guess if Vioxx killed people I guess Vioxx that has
[33:43.940 --> 33:48.460]  just sued the medical examiners and doctors and then and then Merck pharmaceutical
[33:48.460 --> 33:53.540]  wouldn't have lost the lawsuit or I guess why not if you know let's say an
[33:53.540 --> 33:59.020]  airbag doesn't deploy over and over again and the different organizations that
[33:59.020 --> 34:03.340]  test that come out and say it's about airbag well how about Ford just sue the
[34:03.340 --> 34:09.820]  airbag testers and so they won't come out and say the airbags bad or you have
[34:09.820 --> 34:17.860]  somebody I mean this is just amazing this is just amazing that doctors come
[34:17.860 --> 34:25.580]  out and say tasers are killing people so the company sues them this is the
[34:25.580 --> 34:31.660]  mafia America this is how it operates this is how it works now shifting
[34:31.660 --> 34:36.740]  gears she made attention the last few weeks when local newspapers pretty much
[34:36.740 --> 34:42.380]  attacked her then she got an outpouring of support from all over the country and
[34:42.380 --> 34:50.060]  she's state senator Karen Johnson and I appreciate the senator coming on the
[34:50.060 --> 34:56.980]  show with us today for the next 25 minutes or so she is of course based in
[34:56.980 --> 35:04.860]  Scottsdale Arizona she is a member of a lot of great organizations like gun owners
[35:04.860 --> 35:10.580]  of America Arizona right to live concern women of America dr. James Dobbs and
[35:10.580 --> 35:15.900]  focus on the family family research council people for the USA on and on and
[35:15.900 --> 35:21.580]  on she is a mainline conservative but she knows that 9-11 is very very
[35:21.580 --> 35:26.700]  suspicious and has valiantly stood up and spoken out and joined Italian
[35:26.700 --> 35:30.540]  presidents number three in the Blair government a member of the cabinet
[35:30.540 --> 35:36.260]  German defense ministers CIA section chiefs now the list is just
[35:36.260 --> 35:40.020]  unbelievable the majority of victims families of course believe that it's an
[35:40.020 --> 35:43.540]  inside job we've interviewed the heads of those groups like Bill Doyle and
[35:43.540 --> 35:49.140]  others and so she joins a long line of valiant people and speaking out and I
[35:49.140 --> 35:53.940]  appreciate you coming on senator Johnson thank you thank you for having me
[35:53.940 --> 35:58.820]  Alex it's a privilege and a pleasure senator Johnson I mean when did you
[35:58.820 --> 36:02.980]  first question the story when did you first speak out what woke you up to
[36:02.980 --> 36:07.900]  question the official fable and I mean what was your awakening like or did you
[36:07.900 --> 36:13.020]  question it the first day or five years later what happened you know it's when I
[36:13.020 --> 36:17.100]  actually saw what was happening because of course it was on television and we
[36:17.100 --> 36:22.780]  were able to see the second plane hit man right away I'm sorry I've been a
[36:22.780 --> 36:28.860]  conspiratorious I guess for a long long time so I questioned immediately what is
[36:28.860 --> 36:33.780]  going on here is this another false flag like the Reichstag what's going on and
[36:33.780 --> 36:39.740]  really wanted to get to the bottom of it and as things proceeded less and less
[36:39.740 --> 36:43.540]  answers were were answered I mean questions were out there and the
[36:43.540 --> 36:48.580]  the government of course was not giving the right answers so it didn't take very
[36:48.580 --> 36:52.460]  long at all to figure out that something was happening and when they started out
[36:52.460 --> 36:58.100]  with some homeland security I mean that was like a chill going up the back I
[36:58.100 --> 37:03.380]  mean I thought hey this is not a homeland you know we're not Nazi Germany and then
[37:03.380 --> 37:07.180]  you know the Patriot Act was already written up and it was in the wings so
[37:07.180 --> 37:13.020]  there was a lot of things to question well you were very astute to believe
[37:13.020 --> 37:16.860]  that elements of government could be involved from the start because it would
[37:16.860 --> 37:21.260]  be obvious that the Arabs are going to get invaded they're going to get attacked
[37:21.260 --> 37:25.060]  they're going to get bombed and that the military industrial complex is going to
[37:25.060 --> 37:28.780]  get hundreds of billions of no bid contracts a year and liberties are
[37:28.780 --> 37:33.380]  going to be lost and when the government wants that to begin with they have the
[37:33.380 --> 37:37.220]  motive what does you think when you saw the PNAC documents and the vice
[37:37.220 --> 37:44.060]  president saying we need a terrorist attack in America oh gosh Alex I mean it
[37:44.060 --> 37:50.060]  it's just goes so far back you know I'm not sure how much to really say here but
[37:50.060 --> 37:55.940]  when you've got a cabal at the head of of our country and has been there for
[37:55.940 --> 38:00.380]  years pulling the strings behind the scenes I mean whatever it takes to get
[38:00.380 --> 38:06.300]  what they want is what they do and you know I guess I'm kind of into DVDs I've
[38:06.300 --> 38:11.940]  certainly watched your terror storm and endgame and Iraq for sale and different
[38:11.940 --> 38:15.180]  things like that which just are all parts of the puzzle that put everything
[38:15.180 --> 38:21.660]  together well you're absolutely right when did you first start to speak up
[38:21.660 --> 38:29.540]  publicly oh every chance I would get not to too many people seem to want to
[38:29.540 --> 38:35.340]  listen but there was not an occasion to speak kind of officially if you would
[38:35.340 --> 38:42.620]  about this particular issue until we had a piece of legislation come before the
[38:42.620 --> 38:47.340]  Senate here a couple of weeks ago that pertained to a monument that was being
[38:47.340 --> 38:51.620]  built on our they call it the West Bowland Plaza right there by the
[38:51.620 --> 38:59.620]  Capitol and this monument had been built and put up on that plaza by a bunch of
[38:59.620 --> 39:04.740]  people individually privately in other words the legislature did not fund it
[39:04.740 --> 39:10.700]  etc and what happened is the legislature decided to run a bill to remove
[39:10.700 --> 39:15.220]  some of the saying on this particular 9-11 monument because they thought they
[39:15.220 --> 39:18.980]  were a little anti-american or they didn't agree with them and they just
[39:18.980 --> 39:23.020]  assumed that all the conservatives would go along with doing that well I
[39:23.020 --> 39:28.260]  didn't do that because it wasn't our purview to interfere whether I liked it
[39:28.260 --> 39:32.900]  or not it wasn't right for us to do that and at that time so the legislature
[39:32.900 --> 39:37.460]  thought they could ban free speech well exactly you're exactly right I said this
[39:37.460 --> 39:41.860]  is this has to do with your first amendment right we did not you know put
[39:41.860 --> 39:45.900]  the monument up we didn't pay for it it was done by private individuals and I'm
[39:45.900 --> 39:49.220]  not going to vote to tell them that they have to take some of these things off
[39:49.220 --> 39:52.740]  of there and so there was a big controversy about that and I voted no
[39:52.740 --> 39:56.900]  and many of my conservative colleagues came over and said you can't you've got
[39:56.900 --> 40:01.260]  to change your vote this is anti-american you know and on and on they went but it
[40:01.260 --> 40:05.820]  was a matter of principle and at the same time I was able to say that we still
[40:05.820 --> 40:11.860]  have so many unanswered questions about 9-11 you know why would we be putting on
[40:11.860 --> 40:15.860]  or removing different things when we don't even have all the answers and
[40:15.860 --> 40:19.860]  that's what kind of kicked things off well look at how it's been used to
[40:19.860 --> 40:23.940]  totally change our way of life and then if you absolutely and then if we're to
[40:23.940 --> 40:28.980]  believe them that it's this outside threat they've done everything to allow
[40:28.980 --> 40:32.940]  record record numbers of foreigners to come in from the Middle East to leave
[40:32.940 --> 40:39.500]  our borders open our ports open but then they're running random checkpoints in
[40:39.500 --> 40:44.380]  the heartland of the country searching farmers saying well it's because of 9-11
[40:44.380 --> 40:49.380]  and creating all these new bureaucracies and regulations and local cameras that
[40:49.380 --> 40:53.460]  are federally funded to admittedly watch the locals I mean this is
[40:53.460 --> 40:57.340]  government's excuse as their own memos admit we have White House memos and
[40:57.340 --> 41:02.580]  others that say 9-11 has helped them silence political speech and take over
[41:02.580 --> 41:06.220]  domestically and I mean I would imagine Karen just talking to you for the first
[41:06.220 --> 41:09.980]  time I would imagine you sound pretty well informed that you knew about
[41:09.980 --> 41:15.180]  Oklahoma City being an inside job oh oh my gosh I mean all the way from Ruby
[41:15.180 --> 41:20.820]  Ridge to Waco to Oklahoma City I mean there's such a string of things I
[41:20.820 --> 41:26.340]  Alex I'm probably one of your biggest fans because it's so wonderful to find
[41:26.340 --> 41:31.540]  people on the internet and that do wonderful DVDs like you have that speak
[41:31.540 --> 41:36.340]  out and help inform people and boy we have shared those with many many folks
[41:36.340 --> 41:41.020]  now I seem to remember and it might have been you I'm going from memory like six
[41:41.020 --> 41:45.460]  seven years ago right after the Patriot Act there was there was somebody in
[41:45.460 --> 41:52.740]  government in in Arizona who it was a woman who came out and said that if
[41:52.740 --> 41:57.300]  martial laws declared or gun confiscation begins Arizona is gonna
[41:57.300 --> 42:06.820]  secede was that you know that was me oh my gosh I got excoriated for that yes I
[42:06.820 --> 42:11.940]  absolutely it was when Clinton his last year in office and I ran a bill that said
[42:11.940 --> 42:16.820]  if in fact you know Clinton declares a national emergency and suspends the
[42:16.820 --> 42:21.340]  Constitution and goes ahead and tries to confiscate our guns Arizona will
[42:21.340 --> 42:25.540]  secede from the Union okay so that happened right before Bush got in and
[42:25.540 --> 42:30.940]  right now people tried to laugh at that but the preparations Clinton made the
[42:30.940 --> 42:34.900]  executive orders and I went to urban warfare drills and I would imagine then
[42:34.900 --> 42:38.220]  I'm guessing you probably saw that video where the Marines were training for
[42:38.220 --> 42:43.420]  martial law absolutely yes I did see that oh good and and then I saw we had
[42:43.420 --> 42:46.860]  police chiefs on tape in San Antonio and other areas admitting they tried to
[42:46.860 --> 42:50.180]  bribe them and then we had emergency managers on saying yeah they're getting
[42:50.180 --> 42:54.460]  ready for martial law the point is they've taken the safety off over a decade
[42:54.460 --> 42:58.740]  ago are they gonna pull the trigger we don't know but we don't like having this
[42:58.740 --> 43:04.700]  gun put to our heads so so it was police state 2000 that helped spur you yes
[43:04.700 --> 43:10.420]  yes absolutely it did and you know we're in a situation here in Arizona that is
[43:10.420 --> 43:15.780]  just it is so critical because we have we have a governor that is absolutely out
[43:15.780 --> 43:21.820]  of control I mean she has practically made a borderless situation between us
[43:21.820 --> 43:27.220]  and the state of Sonora she signed agreements not only with Sonora which
[43:27.220 --> 43:31.940]  is unconstitutional for her to do as a governor but she signed also agreements
[43:31.940 --> 43:35.980]  with chair talk to put us in this pilot program you know for the real ID and
[43:35.980 --> 43:41.300]  we're running bills to try to opt Arizona out of the real ID kind of like
[43:41.300 --> 43:45.900]  Montana has done with with their governor up there wow he was pretty bold
[43:45.900 --> 43:50.460]  it's fantastic with champions like he and of course what you're doing
[43:50.460 --> 43:57.360]  senator now I remember going back about seven years ago Tucson having knock-and-
[43:57.360 --> 44:00.460]  talk where they come knock on the door predominantly in middle-class
[44:00.460 --> 44:03.620]  neighborhoods in the middle of the day intimidating women to let them into
[44:03.620 --> 44:09.420]  quote search and inspect guns a were you aware of that and be what can we do to
[44:09.420 --> 44:17.180]  stop that wow I was not aware of that Alex you know I I in Arizona this is not
[44:17.180 --> 44:22.700]  even constitutional but I'm complying you have to have a CCW permit you know a
[44:22.700 --> 44:27.620]  concealed weapons carry permit to carry and which I have had since the onset of
[44:27.620 --> 44:32.960]  that because I carry with me everywhere I carry into the capital into my office in
[44:32.960 --> 44:38.020]  the Senate and there's a lot of controversy about that but there does
[44:38.020 --> 44:41.140]  happen to be another woman that's a Democrat that does the same thing so
[44:41.140 --> 44:45.380]  they haven't been able to get on me too bad about it but boy I did not know
[44:45.380 --> 44:50.980]  about any you know checking for guns in Tucson well have you heard of the latest
[44:50.980 --> 44:53.980]  how they're doing in an Oakland how they're doing it in Dallas how they're
[44:53.980 --> 44:57.940]  doing it in DC Boston where they come and asked to come in and inspect your
[44:57.940 --> 45:01.540]  guns or asked to see if you've got illegal guns well my point is that
[45:01.540 --> 45:05.300]  actually started in Tucson and Dallas first time I saw it on the radar was
[45:05.300 --> 45:10.420]  about six seven years ago I have to pull the reports up but look how far we've
[45:10.420 --> 45:15.020]  come with the second amendment that it's weird that a state senator who's
[45:15.020 --> 45:19.300]  obviously under real threat by nuts and in criminals because that is who gets
[45:19.300 --> 45:23.260]  targeted that it's weird that you would have a gun but not that cops would have
[45:23.260 --> 45:26.980]  guns that's how domesticated we've got you know these these these chicken neck
[45:26.980 --> 45:31.340]  liberals these domesticated slaves they're not real liberals they see a
[45:31.340 --> 45:34.540]  citizen with a gun and they cower in fear but they see a guy in a black
[45:34.540 --> 45:38.860]  scheme asking a stormtrooper outfit and they feel safe what happened to you
[45:38.860 --> 45:44.580]  America your comments on that boy I tell you I don't know because I do know that
[45:44.580 --> 45:48.900]  we caused an extreme amount of controversy a little earlier this year in
[45:48.900 --> 45:54.180]  our legislative session I tried to run a bill that would have allowed anybody
[45:54.180 --> 45:58.660]  that comes on to a school campus from you know kindergarten all the way up
[45:58.660 --> 46:03.260]  through the university level if they had a ccw permit to be able to carry that
[46:03.260 --> 46:07.260]  because you know right now our school absolutely gun-free zones which is just
[46:07.260 --> 46:12.540]  an open invitation to all the nuts and oh my gosh you would have thought that I
[46:12.540 --> 46:17.500]  had started World War three I mean it was really something down here at the
[46:17.500 --> 46:22.060]  Capitol people came unglued about that and it got out of committee but it never
[46:22.060 --> 46:26.700]  did get to the floor we have very weak leadership in our Senate and they would
[46:26.700 --> 46:31.780]  not bring the bill to the floor because many Republicans would have to vote for
[46:31.780 --> 46:35.460]  it if it got up on the board but they didn't want to have to vote for it
[46:35.460 --> 46:39.420]  because it would have been tough for him on reelection well Karen you're just an
[46:39.420 --> 46:45.380]  amazing person and I just want to thank you and praise you for all you've done
[46:45.380 --> 46:49.660]  you've just had amazing courage I'm sad to hear that you're going to be
[46:49.660 --> 46:55.140]  retiring from the Senate oh Alex I appreciate that you know my husband and
[46:55.140 --> 46:59.780]  I have 11 children we're expecting our 34th grandchild wow I've got a lot of
[46:59.780 --> 47:03.420]  training and a lot of education to do with the kids I mean they're not where
[47:03.420 --> 47:08.500]  they need to be and and you know they're our future and I feel like I've got a
[47:08.500 --> 47:12.700]  lot of work there but 12 years in the legislature I've run out of patience
[47:12.700 --> 47:18.500]  Alex no but that is I totally understand I mean you're I would imagine a very
[47:18.500 --> 47:23.940]  powerful very you know assertive person very just wonderful so big mama needs to
[47:23.940 --> 47:29.660]  be there to make sure everybody grows up well we need the matriarch that's very
[47:29.660 --> 47:35.980]  kind but we'll keep involved in every way we can I I do a lot of work in Eagle
[47:35.980 --> 47:40.580]  Forum out here in Arizona and you know we have a lot of meetings and we're
[47:40.580 --> 47:46.620]  trying to reach and educate a lot of people what are you hearing from fellow
[47:46.620 --> 47:53.940]  members of Eagle Forum when you come out and question the official fable well I
[47:53.940 --> 47:58.340]  think there's a lot of the gals that our state chairman you know that I work
[47:58.340 --> 48:02.620]  with that probably have very strong feelings that way too and I'd like to
[48:02.620 --> 48:06.780]  see us get into a little bit more of that as an organization and I hope that
[48:06.780 --> 48:10.820]  we'll do so I mean some some of the ladies are a little bit tentative but
[48:10.820 --> 48:15.180]  we're not that way out here you won't find that in Nevada or Utah or Arizona
[48:15.180 --> 48:19.780]  or California I mean those Eagle Forum presidents in those states are pretty
[48:19.780 --> 48:24.540]  hardcore Alex well that's what we need in fact I've talked to a lot of Eagle
[48:24.540 --> 48:29.300]  Forum women across the land and you know the stereotype is that it's liberals
[48:29.300 --> 48:34.380]  who are who believe 9-11's an inside job but no I would say the most
[48:34.380 --> 48:40.300]  hardcore promoters of inside job information and false flag facts are the
[48:40.300 --> 48:45.260]  true conservatives of this country I mean how can how come the free republic
[48:45.260 --> 48:48.780]  crowd claim that they're conservative when they're supporting George Bush and
[48:48.780 --> 48:53.660]  carbon taxes and open borders and the rest of it absolutely absolutely I mean
[48:53.660 --> 48:58.380]  I guess what do they they call them neocons now or whatever but I mean I
[48:58.380 --> 49:05.380]  just sickening I mean Fox News is I've just never seen such a a ridiculous
[49:05.380 --> 49:11.860]  network it well all of it really is it's the internet and and programs like
[49:11.860 --> 49:16.740]  yourself and news with views and you know little bit world met daily used to be
[49:16.740 --> 49:21.380]  better but it still has some good things but anyway it's it you've got to go out
[49:21.380 --> 49:25.380]  and seek the information because it's out there and you can educate yourself if
[49:25.380 --> 49:30.700]  you truly have a desire to do so folks I give you out her congressional website
[49:30.700 --> 49:33.900]  the easiest thing to do is just say senator Karen Johnson and it comes up
[49:33.900 --> 49:38.420]  where would you like to see the 9-11 investigation go if the UN's talking
[49:38.420 --> 49:42.340]  about an investigation now and I think that's okay if it brings it out but I
[49:42.340 --> 49:47.900]  don't want them to claim jurisdiction over this country we need to have a an
[49:47.900 --> 49:53.700]  investigation by the states by the at the federal level it is not the purview I
[49:53.700 --> 49:57.980]  think of the UN to have an investigation oh Alex yeah I agree with you the UN
[49:57.980 --> 50:02.540]  that just always gives me the willing illy I would like to see I guess
[50:02.540 --> 50:09.140]  probably a grand jury maybe a state grand jury that they could call for a
[50:09.140 --> 50:13.380]  federal grand jury investigation I certainly don't want government
[50:13.380 --> 50:17.580]  appointees involved I mean we had enough of that you know with Keenan
[50:17.580 --> 50:22.220]  Hamilton and and some of those folks that even now are questioning the
[50:22.220 --> 50:26.860]  information that they received so I would hope that we could get some private
[50:26.860 --> 50:31.340]  individuals love to see some folks like the Jersey girls you know able to do
[50:31.340 --> 50:34.460]  some things with the information they've been able to get senator Karen
[50:34.460 --> 50:39.100]  Johnson stay there final segment with this amazing hero senator Karen Johnson

[54:29.860 --> 54:35.380]  well we appreciate Karen Johnson's continual service I thought it was her
[54:35.380 --> 54:39.620]  but that was going back eight years it was fighting the martial law takeover
[54:39.620 --> 54:43.100]  by the way when they have curfews in major cities for adults that's martial
[54:43.100 --> 54:46.460]  law when the cops are coming to your door want to quote look for legal guns
[54:46.460 --> 54:49.740]  that's martial law that a warrant when the police want to stop you and quote
[54:49.740 --> 54:53.620]  to a routine check that's martial law that means the bill of rights isn't
[54:53.620 --> 54:57.220]  enforced and I'm not against the police and military but I am angry at how
[54:57.220 --> 54:59.660]  you're letting the globalist these global corporations take over our
[54:59.660 --> 55:06.140]  country Karen in the time we've got left I mean give me your your thoughts on 9
[55:06.140 --> 55:10.420]  11 any other points I mean whatever you think is most important well I just
[55:10.420 --> 55:15.740]  think that we've got just a monumental amount of questions out there that are
[55:15.740 --> 55:22.180]  unanswered I've had some very nice visits with a professor Stephen Jones I've
[55:22.180 --> 55:27.980]  tried to attend a lot of different conferences like Dale Griffin was out
[55:27.980 --> 55:32.380]  here and Stephen Jones and there have been others that have come here to the
[55:32.380 --> 55:36.460]  Phoenix area and they've been very very well attended I've been just really
[55:36.460 --> 55:43.260]  encouraged by it was standing room only we had Ray McGovern here you know of
[55:43.260 --> 55:48.620]  several weeks ago and it was in a huge church and you could not even find a
[55:48.620 --> 55:54.460]  place to sit so people are waking up I really believe it now whether or not
[55:54.460 --> 55:59.420]  it's going to be in time or we can stop any of this I don't know but we've
[55:59.420 --> 56:03.420]  certainly got to try I mean that that's our destiny that's what we have to do
[56:03.420 --> 56:07.140]  we have to get out and try to stop all of this and return our government back
[56:07.140 --> 56:11.940]  to what our founding fathers intended it to be and and that that's my goal well
[56:11.940 --> 56:15.900]  I agree with you and I want everybody understand something the left is woken
[56:15.900 --> 56:19.580]  up to government evil under Bush but they need to know that Bush is just a
[56:19.580 --> 56:23.020]  puppet and under Hillary or Obama it's probably going to be the same or even
[56:23.020 --> 56:28.060]  worse each president gets worse because things are getting worse the globalist
[56:28.060 --> 56:32.260]  are making their move they're looting this country and people need to
[56:32.260 --> 56:37.300]  understand this is a bipartisan New World Order can I get your take on that
[56:37.300 --> 56:43.060]  senator oh you hit it right on hit the nail right on the head Alex you know by
[56:43.060 --> 56:47.500]  2010 is when they plan to have us moved into this North American Union you know
[56:47.500 --> 56:52.300]  which is a European Union for us with Canada and Mexico and and on and on and
[56:52.300 --> 56:56.940]  as far as the Democrats and Republicans I mean there's times when I'm ashamed to
[56:56.940 --> 57:02.240]  even say I'm a Republican because of the connection with the Bushites and those
[57:02.240 --> 57:05.780]  people the neocons that have been running things and destroying this country
[57:05.780 --> 57:10.740]  but your Democrats are just as culpable and I don't know why people think they
[57:10.740 --> 57:15.220]  have to choose between one or the other I mean we had a candidate we had Dr. Ron
[57:15.220 --> 57:20.620]  Paul a man that truly believes in this country and understands you know the
[57:20.620 --> 57:25.300]  federal reserve system how bad it is and and on and on the Constitution and yet
[57:25.300 --> 57:29.020]  the people rejected that I don't know whether it's because of course the
[57:29.020 --> 57:32.060]  controlled media never really got the information out the way it should have
[57:32.060 --> 57:38.180]  been but we've just got to keep working at it I agree senator can I keep you five
[57:38.180 --> 57:41.420]  more minutes or do you have to go oh sure five more minutes is fine we got a
[57:41.420 --> 57:45.580]  60 or actually 70 second break and we'll come back to you but we've still got
[57:45.580 --> 57:51.380]  some time now you know Ron Paul has won though I mean he got the word out yeah
[57:51.380 --> 57:55.900]  millions woke up I want the supporters to know that we've still had a big
[57:55.900 --> 58:00.980]  victory do you agree I do definitely let me tell you in here here in Arizona I
[58:00.980 --> 58:07.460]  was the co-chairman for his campaign here in Arizona and it was amazing the
[58:07.460 --> 58:11.980]  response that we got from the people here I mean oh my goodness we had him
[58:11.980 --> 58:16.820]  out here three or four different times in the early spring and as once again
[58:16.820 --> 58:20.900]  standing room only but the people just we had neighborhood meetings all over
[58:20.900 --> 58:26.140]  the place and the homes were just packed and it was very encouraging to see how
[58:26.140 --> 58:30.100]  how strong the people felt about what was happening to stay there stay there

[1:00:26.260 --> 1:00:29.140]  globalists are gonna do now that this is the biggest awakening it's
[1:00:29.140 --> 1:00:33.540]  exponential I can see that it's not gonna stop it's we've reached critical mass
[1:00:33.540 --> 1:00:38.780]  it's it's an exponential chain reaction now the new world order is gonna be more
[1:00:38.780 --> 1:00:42.780]  more confronted as they squeeze the people now know it's the federal reserve
[1:00:42.780 --> 1:00:46.220]  engineering the economic problems they now know the criminal elements of the
[1:00:46.220 --> 1:00:49.900]  government are behind terror attacks they now know that parts of the federal
[1:00:49.900 --> 1:00:54.220]  government ship in the majority of narcotics the people now know what do
[1:00:54.220 --> 1:00:59.780]  you see the establishment doing to try to block that I guess through the media
[1:00:59.780 --> 1:01:04.380]  there they're doing everything they can you know to try to lull the people back
[1:01:04.380 --> 1:01:11.140]  to sleep again Alex the people just have to really really be alert and they've
[1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:14.420]  got to wake up and they've got to keep doing what they're doing and pushing and
[1:01:14.420 --> 1:01:21.620]  pushing this back you know I'm I hate to say it but I'm afraid that that you know
[1:01:21.620 --> 1:01:26.300]  it could come to some very very bad situations in this country where we're
[1:01:26.300 --> 1:01:33.100]  gonna perhaps have to take up arms and defend ourselves I hate to say that I
[1:01:33.100 --> 1:01:37.020]  hope it doesn't come to that but I think we need to be prepared because I'm
[1:01:37.020 --> 1:01:41.620]  very I'm very fearful in many ways of what's coming down the pike oh they're
[1:01:41.620 --> 1:01:45.340]  not going to stop pushing I mean if we wake up and and now you've got the
[1:01:45.340 --> 1:01:48.820]  Commission creeping away saying there was a cover-up they know it's coming out
[1:01:48.820 --> 1:01:53.540]  it's Europe the UN is talking about it the establishment knows that we know
[1:01:53.540 --> 1:01:59.100]  that they carried out the attacks and I see him pulling anything bigger attacks
[1:01:59.100 --> 1:02:03.540]  wars and then I don't think that's gonna work for him either it's like they're a
[1:02:03.540 --> 1:02:08.620]  cornered creature but they're a cornered creature that keeps on a common so we
[1:02:08.620 --> 1:02:13.780]  have to keep fighting back I agree I I see very serious times ahead that's why
[1:02:13.780 --> 1:02:17.340]  the more people we wake up now the better because it'll just be over that
[1:02:17.340 --> 1:02:21.660]  much sooner and I'm begging police and military and others to wake up and stand
[1:02:21.660 --> 1:02:25.580]  with the Republic and not with the counterfeit government Senator Johnson
[1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:30.220]  enclosing what were one or two of the big smoking guns you know not just the
[1:02:30.220 --> 1:02:34.540]  motive in the history of you know who's done in the past but what else about 9
[1:02:34.540 --> 1:02:40.580]  11 made you question it well my gosh when you saw building seven go down I mean
[1:02:40.580 --> 1:02:45.340]  everybody should have gone what the hay is going on here my goodness you know
[1:02:45.340 --> 1:02:49.860]  building seven that hardly had much of a fire in it and I mean it it was a
[1:02:49.860 --> 1:02:54.540]  demolition I mean that would have been apparent to just about anybody but to
[1:02:54.540 --> 1:03:00.420]  have took the two twin towers just pancake down you know right on top of
[1:03:00.420 --> 1:03:05.220]  each other like that I mean there's no way if you have a plane striking the
[1:03:05.220 --> 1:03:11.020]  buildings where it the least occurs that is where you're going to see him
[1:03:11.020 --> 1:03:17.460]  leaning and it would have fallen you know in a crazy manner not just right
[1:03:17.460 --> 1:03:21.940]  down I mean it was very apparent at least to me that there had to be
[1:03:21.940 --> 1:03:26.860]  demolition or some something went on in that building beyond the plane striking
[1:03:26.860 --> 1:03:31.420]  the building that they never would have taken either one of those towers down by
[1:03:31.420 --> 1:03:35.340]  having a plane crash into them that way so that that was one of the big things
[1:03:35.340 --> 1:03:38.980]  I mean there's questions about shanks builders questions about the Pentagon
[1:03:38.980 --> 1:03:45.940]  you know the the calls the cell phone calls that were supposedly made you
[1:03:45.940 --> 1:03:50.180]  know high up in the air on those planes which were impossible at that time and
[1:03:50.180 --> 1:03:53.820]  then they try to abscond and say oh that was air phones but no they say they
[1:03:53.820 --> 1:03:58.820]  were independent non-airphones go ahead I mean it's just crazy and then also the
[1:03:58.820 --> 1:04:05.020]  tapes the tapes of I'm trying to think Muhammad was his last name Kalil
[1:04:05.020 --> 1:04:09.100]  Sheik Muhammad yes whoever he was that they they arrested and I mean they
[1:04:09.100 --> 1:04:14.620]  tortured the man they actually had tapes of all of that and the 9-11 Commission
[1:04:14.620 --> 1:04:18.020]  was not allowed to see the tapes they weren't allowed to even interrogate or
[1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:24.700]  talk to the interrogators of this Muhammad fella and now they're gonna have
[1:04:24.700 --> 1:04:28.900]  a show trial now they're gonna have a a show trial senator but but those were
[1:04:28.900 --> 1:04:33.660]  all destroyed the tapes were destroyed I mean you know what about that what is

[1:11:10.420 --> 1:11:14.260]  my films but other films we carry before we go down staying I want to put this
[1:11:14.260 --> 1:11:22.820]  thought out and then get his take out of the gates on this and that is that the
[1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:27.300]  globalists are into behavioral psychology they admit they are and they play
[1:11:27.300 --> 1:11:36.540]  out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 steps out on how societies operate out what people will
[1:11:36.540 --> 1:11:42.340]  do if a happens they even have plans a b and c with different things that could
[1:11:42.340 --> 1:11:46.980]  happen different domino effects that could develop where they stage a terror
[1:11:46.980 --> 1:11:50.380]  attack here terror attack there they get bigger and bigger they take more of our
[1:11:50.380 --> 1:11:54.420]  liberties they they bomb the first World Trade Center attack they bomb the
[1:11:54.420 --> 1:11:59.540]  Oklahoma City building they carry out 9 11 attacks then they launch wars that
[1:11:59.540 --> 1:12:02.860]  get us bankrupted and they come in with the banking takeover and give the
[1:12:02.860 --> 1:12:07.260]  federal reserve total governmental power they set up a domestic police state
[1:12:07.260 --> 1:12:11.980]  start pushes pushing us around framing us taking our property kidnapping our
[1:12:11.980 --> 1:12:16.300]  children engaging in every form of wickedness you can imagine tasering us
[1:12:16.300 --> 1:12:21.740]  murdering us on a daily basis and then we start fighting back they're already
[1:12:21.740 --> 1:12:26.300]  geared up to fight the non-existent al-qaeda terrorist they think we're
[1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:30.220]  gonna fight back so now they overnight say no longer is al-qaeda wearing
[1:12:30.220 --> 1:12:34.700]  turbans their blonde hair blue eyed they're everywhere any misdemeanor is an
[1:12:34.700 --> 1:12:38.420]  act of terror we're gonna have random sweeps of the public we're gonna search
[1:12:38.420 --> 1:12:44.580]  your homes for guns all crime is terror and so they're geared up with millions
[1:12:44.580 --> 1:12:47.980]  of cops ready but that's pretty sophisticated the cops don't get that
[1:12:47.980 --> 1:12:53.860]  that is in government documents that is admitted they're gonna take the water
[1:12:53.860 --> 1:12:57.620]  districts the schools the roads the pension funds they admit they're taking
[1:12:57.620 --> 1:13:01.260]  it all and the cops are standing there going why is the public hate us so much
[1:13:01.260 --> 1:13:05.940]  why are they getting all geared up and angry and then see as more cops get
[1:13:05.940 --> 1:13:09.140]  killed as people go off individually here and there and shoot them and that's
[1:13:09.140 --> 1:13:13.940]  happening all the time now choosing an old world war two vets the classic type
[1:13:13.940 --> 1:13:16.860]  they pull an old world war two vet over it's happened a couple times in Austin
[1:13:16.860 --> 1:13:20.340]  they were trying to take one guy's property so he shot the state police
[1:13:20.340 --> 1:13:23.940]  guy in the face and he told them that the last time they pulled him over he
[1:13:23.940 --> 1:13:26.420]  said look you're not getting my property they were trying to be they were
[1:13:26.420 --> 1:13:30.700]  involved in it state policeman was his next-door neighbor and he said don't
[1:13:30.700 --> 1:13:34.700]  pull me over again son the next time they did it was over and the guy said
[1:13:34.700 --> 1:13:38.620]  hey I'm 80 something years old go ahead and execute me I don't care you know
[1:13:38.620 --> 1:13:41.860]  yeah we don't want that to happen but as that happens the cops flip out more on
[1:13:41.860 --> 1:13:45.740]  the general public they taze old women for asking questions blind women in
[1:13:45.740 --> 1:13:48.620]  wheelchairs throwing people in wheelchairs out breaking their bones
[1:13:48.620 --> 1:13:53.900]  it's all on video and as that happens the police get more compacted together
[1:13:53.900 --> 1:13:58.940]  their psychology is more against us it's gang psychology the more abusive you
[1:13:58.940 --> 1:14:02.060]  get the more the public hates you the more you believe what you're being told
[1:14:02.060 --> 1:14:06.380]  about everybody hates you you got to stick together so that's how we're all
[1:14:06.380 --> 1:14:12.260]  being played together enough said I have laid out that bit of the rant let's go
[1:14:12.260 --> 1:14:18.820]  ahead now and go to Alan Stang the website is alanstang.com spelled S-T-A-N-G
[1:14:18.820 --> 1:14:23.540]  alanstang.com Alan thank you for coming on with us good to be with you Alex
[1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:28.500]  thanks for having me you are quite a mind quite a character and I love your
[1:14:28.500 --> 1:14:32.700]  comment about smirk tell us a little bit about Alan Stang and then you got the
[1:14:32.700 --> 1:14:35.740]  floor tell us what you think's most important today and then I'd like you
[1:14:35.740 --> 1:14:40.740]  to comment on what I was just saying well about me I've been in the battle for
[1:14:40.740 --> 1:14:50.580]  America Alex for close on to 50 years I started out working at NBC in New York
[1:14:50.580 --> 1:14:56.340]  where I wrote a radio show I worked at various 50,000 watt clear channel radio
[1:14:56.340 --> 1:15:02.260]  stations in New York I was one of Mike Wallace's original writers I wrote the
[1:15:02.260 --> 1:15:10.380]  show that sent Mike to CBS to CBS News and and the show that has made him
[1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:17.780]  famous I've written I guess about 17 books I think hundreds of magazine
[1:15:17.780 --> 1:15:24.060]  articles I've lectured around the world and of course my pieces that I do
[1:15:24.060 --> 1:15:28.540]  regularly appear around the world on various sites I couldn't tell you all
[1:15:28.540 --> 1:15:33.180]  I don't know myself where they appear they start out on my site they appear on
[1:15:33.180 --> 1:15:40.300]  newswithviews.com etherzone.com did I mention I've lectured around the
[1:15:40.300 --> 1:15:45.140]  world and now what I think is most important Alex is that what you were
[1:15:45.140 --> 1:15:51.340]  just talking about pick one or two or three or a dozen or two is the fact
[1:15:51.340 --> 1:15:58.460]  that the conspiracy for world government fronted right now by President
[1:15:58.460 --> 1:16:05.580]  Jorge W. Bush is conducting the dismemberment the dismantlement the
[1:16:05.580 --> 1:16:10.740]  abolition of the United States and the imposition of a totalitarian socialist
[1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:16.700]  dictatorship on the people of our country in which case our country would
[1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:21.300]  no longer exist it would simply be a wide spot in the road and part of the
[1:16:21.300 --> 1:16:27.420]  new nation that they are imposing upon us as we talk about it the merger of the
[1:16:27.420 --> 1:16:33.300]  United States Canada and Mexico and so this is what I believe is the most
[1:16:33.300 --> 1:16:39.140]  important aspect of what's going on the main front in the war for the world in
[1:16:39.140 --> 1:16:44.540]  the battle for America is right here not in Iraq not in Afghanistan those are
[1:16:44.540 --> 1:16:48.260]  fronts in the war but they are not the main front the main front is right here
[1:16:48.260 --> 1:16:52.980]  in the United States in Austin and everywhere that's right we're the prize
[1:16:52.980 --> 1:16:57.740]  if they can get this engine they've won that's what it's all about and that's
[1:16:57.740 --> 1:17:05.300]  why you see what what is happening here most Americans I find Alex do not have
[1:17:05.300 --> 1:17:11.820]  the the experience of living in a country that is not governed by the by
[1:17:11.820 --> 1:17:15.900]  emergency I've lived in a couple of other countries and so I have a
[1:17:15.900 --> 1:17:21.980]  perspective that most Americans said do not we live in government by emergency
[1:17:21.980 --> 1:17:27.660]  government dominated by the the old Marxist technique of dialectical
[1:17:27.660 --> 1:17:32.900]  materialism in which the conspiracy for world government controls both sides
[1:17:32.900 --> 1:17:39.300]  and they they manipulate us between those sides in the direction they want us to
[1:17:39.300 --> 1:17:44.540]  go and so that is why so much of what you see is is confusing if you do not
[1:17:44.540 --> 1:17:50.860]  understand dialectical materialism but it is possible to live I I'm old enough
[1:17:50.860 --> 1:17:55.460]  to remember living in our own country when it was still the greatest country
[1:17:55.460 --> 1:18:00.580]  on earth before the the constant application of the rule of emergency you
[1:18:00.580 --> 1:18:04.980]  notice always there is some emergencies that there's there's a war on this
[1:18:04.980 --> 1:18:08.620]  there's a war on that there's a shooting war there's a war on drugs there's a
[1:18:08.620 --> 1:18:15.940]  war on on obesity now but in other countries you can actually live day
[1:18:15.940 --> 1:18:19.860]  to day without this constant pressure of emergencies well I've talked to police
[1:18:19.860 --> 1:18:24.340]  and I've said you know we've got more people in prison than any other country
[1:18:24.340 --> 1:18:28.420]  we've got 35% of the world's prison population and we're only getting more
[1:18:28.420 --> 1:18:32.260]  and they say good that means we fight crime and I'm like no it means your
[1:18:32.260 --> 1:18:36.900]  bosses ship the drugs in and so that the dumb public takes the bait you
[1:18:36.900 --> 1:18:41.820]  literally hunt us and and and some cops still deny that their bosses bring the
[1:18:41.820 --> 1:18:45.900]  stuff in but I mean that's one example how it's problem reaction solution
[1:18:45.900 --> 1:18:52.820]  explain the dialectic to people well the the conspiracy for world government
[1:18:52.820 --> 1:18:57.580]  recognizes that it is going to meet opposition as they advance toward their
[1:18:57.580 --> 1:19:02.420]  goal of complete world totalitarian dictatorship their realists they're
[1:19:02.420 --> 1:19:06.500]  practical they know they're going to meet opposition and so they've devised
[1:19:06.500 --> 1:19:12.620]  the technique to handle it what they do is they could create their own
[1:19:12.620 --> 1:19:18.300]  opposition that they can control and manage and the way they do that is that
[1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:24.020]  they either infiltrate established organizations and take control of them
[1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:29.420]  and pervert them or they create their own organizations out of whole cloth and
[1:19:29.420 --> 1:19:37.380]  run them as as manipulated and managed opposition stay there speaking of Mike
[1:19:37.380 --> 1:19:41.180]  Wallace you know he got beat up by the cops and all the witnesses said they
[1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:45.020]  beat him up they beat up an 89 year old man and Wallace says that's because
[1:19:45.020 --> 1:19:55.500]  America is down the tubes it is a big idea a new world order in the near
[1:19:55.500 --> 1:20:01.380]  future earth is dominated by a powerful government it's known as the builder
[1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:07.100]  bird but their objective being world domination for thousands of years their
[1:20:07.100 --> 1:20:12.140]  dark-order group now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great
[1:20:12.140 --> 1:20:18.260]  dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[1:20:18.260 --> 1:20:23.500]  for the first time in history the elites plan for world government is blown

[1:24:00.020 --> 1:24:02.660]  the office we're doing some work where they was telling me a story about his
[1:24:02.660 --> 1:24:06.540]  buddy Marine Corps sergeant came back in front of all these witnesses the cops
[1:24:06.540 --> 1:24:09.380]  were checking IDs on the side of the street he said hey it's a free country
[1:24:09.380 --> 1:24:14.180]  I'm gonna show you my ID they put him in a coma and they found out those guys
[1:24:14.180 --> 1:24:19.660]  were all former military back from Iraq they're on drugs they're crazy we're
[1:24:19.660 --> 1:24:23.220]  talking about him he mentioned Mike Wallace so I Google Mike Wallace I was
[1:24:23.220 --> 1:24:28.300]  just thinking about Mike Wallace of CBS 89 years old and I remember when it came
[1:24:28.300 --> 1:24:32.700]  out and I've got the news article here he just questioned police harassing his
[1:24:32.700 --> 1:24:36.740]  driver so they beat you know they they manhandling beat him up a bit and then
[1:24:36.740 --> 1:24:39.660]  the witnesses all said yeah mr. Wallace didn't touch them they tried to lie and
[1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:43.460]  claim that but then they had witnesses this is all part of it I mean this
[1:24:43.460 --> 1:24:49.620]  country is gone a Bears football player Cedric Benson former top UT running back
[1:24:49.620 --> 1:24:53.500]  was out on Lake Travis and it said he refused to breathalyzer so they
[1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:58.580]  arrested him and then I saw the police photo he's all beat up I mean this is
[1:24:58.580 --> 1:25:03.380]  that land of the free home of the brave mr. Sting where it's just crazy
[1:25:03.380 --> 1:25:07.060]  military goons running around beating us up I mean is that what freedom is
[1:25:07.060 --> 1:25:14.820]  about it's gone Alex pretty much gone and the next step that I can see I wish
[1:25:14.820 --> 1:25:20.540]  I did not believe this I constantly try to convince myself otherwise I can't do
[1:25:20.540 --> 1:25:27.340]  it the next step is going to be up and the next provocation similar to 9-11
[1:25:27.340 --> 1:25:33.980]  which will provide the excuse for the federal government fronted by Jorge
[1:25:33.980 --> 1:25:41.300]  Doblyou Bush to impose martial law total government control total police
[1:25:41.300 --> 1:25:46.460]  control on the American people as the so-called solution to the problem that
[1:25:46.460 --> 1:25:52.860]  they will create themselves I cannot see any other step coming than that and of
[1:25:52.860 --> 1:25:58.100]  course that would be and then the penultimate step that would propel us
[1:25:58.100 --> 1:26:02.180]  into a total regional and then world government you don't think you know you
[1:26:02.180 --> 1:26:06.740]  don't think that they're gonna pass the baton to a fresh runner like Obama or
[1:26:06.740 --> 1:26:10.900]  Hillary and that I mean we know they're gearing up the martial law grid but you
[1:26:10.900 --> 1:26:14.580]  think they're gonna try it when Bush is here well it's it's I don't know it's
[1:26:14.580 --> 1:26:20.660]  possible Bush could precipitate it for political reasons and for example right
[1:26:20.660 --> 1:26:24.820]  now aren't we reading that they are tightening up the border that they are
[1:26:24.820 --> 1:26:31.580]  doing something at last to prevent the illegal alien invasion that Bush has
[1:26:31.580 --> 1:26:34.660]  been running they're not really doing that they built like 50 miles and the
[1:26:34.660 --> 1:26:37.340]  illegal aliens they're not really doing it but the illegal aliens are building
[1:26:37.340 --> 1:26:42.540]  it right they're not really doing it but it's probably it has yielded I just
[1:26:42.540 --> 1:26:45.980]  read this morning before we went on the air and associated press story that says
[1:26:45.980 --> 1:26:50.060]  they're tightening up at the border all right in preparation so they're acting
[1:26:50.060 --> 1:26:53.660]  like they're acting like acting like right it's it's a it's a token it's a
[1:26:53.660 --> 1:26:58.500]  token it isn't the real demonstrate exercise it's a demonstration it's a
[1:26:58.500 --> 1:27:03.260]  token and so that they can get these stories out of AP and the rest of the
[1:27:03.260 --> 1:27:06.380]  establishment and you see that as a sign they're about the stage something
[1:27:06.380 --> 1:27:09.260]  because now they're at least acting like they're doing something it's possible
[1:27:09.260 --> 1:27:16.460]  it's pop but but they could pass it along either to Hillary or to Obama or to
[1:27:16.460 --> 1:27:24.180]  McCain if all of these people are front men and so it really doesn't matter who
[1:27:24.180 --> 1:27:29.900]  does it all of them are factotums of the conspiracy for world government but
[1:27:29.900 --> 1:27:35.620]  well what I'm saying is that Bush could precipitate it as for political reasons
[1:27:35.620 --> 1:27:40.340]  and of course that that wouldn't make any difference to the conspiracy for a
[1:27:40.340 --> 1:27:45.860]  world government above all of them let's expand on that give the definition
[1:27:45.860 --> 1:27:52.380]  for that dialectic the definition well I mean I mean earlier you said for those
[1:27:52.380 --> 1:27:55.660]  that don't understand what they're doing don't understand the definition give it
[1:27:55.660 --> 1:28:02.380]  to them dialectical materialism is the is the Marxist tactic that the
[1:28:02.380 --> 1:28:08.420]  favorite Marxist tactic in which Marxism in which the the conspiracy for
[1:28:08.420 --> 1:28:14.780]  world government at the top uses both sides of every issue creates its own
[1:28:14.780 --> 1:28:20.220]  opposition infiltrates organizations that already exists that already exist
[1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:26.700]  and perverts them or if necessary creates its own organizations that they can use
[1:28:26.700 --> 1:28:31.820]  and manipulate in order to regulate manage their opposition that they are
[1:28:31.820 --> 1:28:35.700]  they are very practical and realistic they know they are going to meet
[1:28:35.700 --> 1:28:40.740]  opposition and so the way they control they create a false paradigm exactly
[1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:46.100]  now you can see that in the media for example you see we have the communist
[1:28:46.100 --> 1:28:50.660]  media in our country I call it the left communist media and the right communist
[1:28:50.660 --> 1:28:55.300]  media so for example in the left communist media you have the communist
[1:28:55.300 --> 1:28:59.980]  broadcasting system you have the communist news network for example you
[1:28:59.980 --> 1:29:04.620]  have the national bureau of communism and so on and then the right communist
[1:29:04.620 --> 1:29:12.100]  media would consist of Rush Limbagg would consist of a shallow Sean
[1:29:12.100 --> 1:29:16.980]  Hannah twit a loopy Laura people like that that would be the right communist
[1:29:16.980 --> 1:29:21.220]  stay there let's talk more about this now the CIA some of their analysts early
[1:29:21.220 --> 1:29:25.620]  on before they got taken over admitted that that's what the communist model was
[1:29:25.620 --> 1:29:29.260]  but against the bankers creating a model not really communist where it's like the
[1:29:29.260 --> 1:29:33.460]  Sims or these games you play well that's all the news and things are it's all
[1:29:33.460 --> 1:29:37.260]  controlled they have fake debates about fake issues amongst themselves while the
[1:29:37.260 --> 1:29:42.160]  real world goes on all around you they're right back we're on the march the

[1:33:56.300 --> 1:33:59.940]  next hour about the Devil Jean Palfrey murder yes I was on her all over
[1:33:59.940 --> 1:34:04.420]  there Saturday yes it was bizarre to get a call and go home that show but they
[1:34:04.420 --> 1:34:07.700]  had to agree that she's been murdered and he called for an investigation by the
[1:34:07.700 --> 1:34:11.300]  governor of Florida the problem is that's like going to be Elsie Bob and
[1:34:11.300 --> 1:34:16.180]  asking him to investigate Lucifer it's the same entity and that's how they do
[1:34:16.180 --> 1:34:20.860]  it they give you false choices it's like if they say hey you can take a drink out
[1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:25.300]  of any one of these 10 cops but all 10 of them have cyanide in them doesn't
[1:34:25.300 --> 1:34:30.740]  matter and they teach the cops their God they teach the bureaucracies their God
[1:34:30.740 --> 1:34:35.300]  they violate the Bill of Rights the Constitution in every way every day while
[1:34:35.300 --> 1:34:38.140]  they run around saying they're here to defend America and its liberty and
[1:34:38.140 --> 1:34:45.140]  freedom now are all the police bad no but that's because they're individually
[1:34:45.140 --> 1:34:51.180]  good people the system is bad the system is rotten and if you think it's bad to
[1:34:51.180 --> 1:34:54.740]  be the most imprisoned most regulated population in the world we're about to
[1:34:54.740 --> 1:34:59.860]  be the most taxed most regulated times 10 and they're gonna create all these

[1:35:05.020 --> 1:35:10.980]  governmental enforcers with tasers and guns and basically they're gonna show
[1:35:10.980 --> 1:35:15.940]  you they're gonna show you who's boss and then as they destroy the economy you

[1:36:20.420 --> 1:36:25.300]  telling you what to do and if you don't like it they're into being tough and
[1:36:25.300 --> 1:36:29.820]  tough means taser in you and beating you and now they don't even cover it up
[1:36:29.820 --> 1:36:35.060]  I mean I remember that footage two weeks ago with that football player no
[1:36:35.060 --> 1:36:38.100]  criminal record wasn't one of the gang banger times they said get out of your
[1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:40.980]  car he gets out they start yelling at him he says what's wrong officer in a
[1:36:40.980 --> 1:36:45.820]  nice voice he puts his hands here and he says please everything's okay like he's
[1:36:45.820 --> 1:36:49.740]  talking to a child and the cop shoves him and says don't make fist at me and he
[1:36:49.740 --> 1:36:54.340]  said I didn't he starts pleading again please sir please so they taser him and
[1:36:54.340 --> 1:36:58.180]  then charge him and it's all on video that they assaulted him and tased him
[1:36:58.180 --> 1:37:02.940]  that is enough you're getting charged with resisting and again I don't hate
[1:37:02.940 --> 1:37:08.420]  the police but good Lord that Fox News in Georgia would show it and say that the
[1:37:08.420 --> 1:37:12.380]  football player was bad when the video it's it's like the Houston police kill
[1:37:12.380 --> 1:37:16.540]  this guy on video and they say he was bad he reads for something and he clearly
[1:37:16.540 --> 1:37:21.100]  didn't Alan I know you're on the show about the whole new owner system and I'm
[1:37:21.100 --> 1:37:26.140]  bringing up the police it's just that it's getting crazier and crazier and I
[1:37:26.140 --> 1:37:29.380]  can't drive anywhere now without seeing cops pull people over they're just
[1:37:29.380 --> 1:37:35.220]  everywhere and I mean I I don't like this country and I've been a third world
[1:37:35.220 --> 1:37:38.020]  nations and I don't see this many cops and they don't act like this I mean this
[1:37:38.020 --> 1:37:42.020]  country is really going down and they're just hiring more and more of them
[1:37:42.020 --> 1:37:51.780]  Alan you know you remind me for example we lived in Costa Rica in Costa Rica the
[1:37:51.780 --> 1:37:58.980]  police don't care what you do I mean as long as you don't do something crazy
[1:37:58.980 --> 1:38:04.620]  commit some real crime as long as you don't try to overthrow their government
[1:38:04.620 --> 1:38:13.020]  they leave you alone now it's true if you I use the example if you strangled
[1:38:13.020 --> 1:38:20.220]  your wife and hung her body on a rope outside the wall of your house in a
[1:38:20.220 --> 1:38:23.420]  couple of weeks the police would come around very politely they'd say well
[1:38:23.420 --> 1:38:28.740]  and as an order is there anything wrong here any problem and you said well why
[1:38:28.740 --> 1:38:32.540]  do you well I see you've got a woman hanging here by a rope outside is it
[1:38:32.540 --> 1:38:36.820]  was there any problem but if you didn't do that you would never hear from them
[1:38:36.820 --> 1:38:44.540]  you would just live so when exactly I'm tired of hearing from you I want to live
[1:38:44.540 --> 1:38:49.020]  my life get out of my business and stop passing more laws with your kangaroo
[1:38:49.020 --> 1:38:53.380]  legislatures to get my business I don't want to see you I don't want to smell
[1:38:53.380 --> 1:38:59.220]  your bad breath state trooper like this one that had green teeth so but the
[1:38:59.220 --> 1:39:03.020]  message that I think we should be delivering to your listeners here Alex
[1:39:03.020 --> 1:39:08.740]  is that if you are serious ladies and gentlemen when you say you're upset when
[1:39:08.740 --> 1:39:13.860]  you hear what Alex tells you every day you better get started doing something
[1:39:13.860 --> 1:39:19.380]  right now as soon as the show ends you better get get busy get cracking get
[1:39:19.380 --> 1:39:24.820]  organized and get moving because if you don't every day it's going to get
[1:39:24.820 --> 1:39:29.780]  harder and harder and harder to resist and the result of this is going to be a
[1:39:29.780 --> 1:39:37.220]  situation that would make the the the total control of a Hitler or a Maut
[1:39:37.220 --> 1:39:41.860]  Saint Paul or a Stalin seem like like him like him let me stop you thought
[1:39:41.860 --> 1:39:45.060]  for the liberty let me copy the federal government Al Gore they're all
[1:39:45.060 --> 1:39:50.580]  creating multi-million and 10 million man tattletale youth armies even with
[1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:54.700]  uniforms to go around bossing us and I got news for the system this isn't
[1:39:54.700 --> 1:39:59.460]  Russia or China there's still people I mean everybody I know is like not in a
[1:39:59.460 --> 1:40:02.900]  bragger not in a bragging way I mean they're actually got guns they're
[1:40:02.900 --> 1:40:06.460]  oiling them and I'm telling people hold back don't do it I don't think the
[1:40:06.460 --> 1:40:11.620]  establishment realizes that people are sick of it now you you had a
[1:40:11.620 --> 1:40:17.860]  report just recently that I came across this morning someone sent it to me in
[1:40:17.860 --> 1:40:23.420]  which you were talking with Jack Mclam my my old friend Jack Mclam about the
[1:40:23.420 --> 1:40:30.380]  fact that the conspiracy is now buying up the ammunition companies to control the
[1:40:30.380 --> 1:40:33.780]  ammunition so you will not be able to get ammunition and there already are
[1:40:33.780 --> 1:40:40.500]  ammunition shortages and it's real it's real it's real so so again ladies and
[1:40:40.500 --> 1:40:45.500]  gentlemen if you believe what Alex tells you every day and I don't see how you
[1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:49.260]  cannot because already you are experiencing this in your own private
[1:40:49.260 --> 1:40:52.900]  lives you don't have to read about it you don't have to hear about it on the
[1:40:52.900 --> 1:40:57.940]  radio as you travel around you can see that what what he and I are telling you
[1:40:57.940 --> 1:41:03.260]  is true you better get going right now I'm how much longer are you going to let
[1:41:03.260 --> 1:41:08.820]  this continue before you will take the necessary action well listen I mean I
[1:41:08.820 --> 1:41:12.420]  had state police pull me over who were nice I've had a wreck before a nice
[1:41:12.420 --> 1:41:17.980]  state trooper showed up were fans of the show but then on highway 37 I got pulled
[1:41:17.980 --> 1:41:21.260]  over we're going six miles over the speed limit and they were waiting over a
[1:41:21.260 --> 1:41:25.540]  hill where you forget and let it go fast even if you know and the guy comes
[1:41:25.540 --> 1:41:29.940]  over his breath stinks he's got a woman with him and she starts looking at my
[1:41:29.940 --> 1:41:33.740]  kids and asking if they're my kids and what kind of seat they're in like a
[1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:37.500]  hungry wolf and I almost flipped out I mean I can't handle it anymore folks
[1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:41.700]  they look like criminals this woman looked like scum I mean my instincts for
[1:41:41.700 --> 1:41:46.460]  this is a bad person and I just can't handle all these fruit cakes they're
[1:41:46.460 --> 1:41:50.420]  coming back from war who got a problem who are bullies who want to have power
[1:41:50.420 --> 1:41:58.020]  messing with me and I just can't handle it staying well I appreciate your
[1:41:58.020 --> 1:42:04.620]  sentiment and and there are millions of people like it like us you and me around
[1:42:04.620 --> 1:42:11.580]  the country and again the thing is coming to a head I I suspect that they
[1:42:11.580 --> 1:42:17.980]  are trying to provoke violence in order to create the excuse that they would
[1:42:17.980 --> 1:42:23.800]  need it's interesting to speculate by the way Alex what would they do to
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:28.340]  provoke the incident or series of incidents that they would need to impose
[1:42:28.340 --> 1:42:33.380]  the martial law one thing they could do of course would be a financial collapse
[1:42:33.380 --> 1:42:40.860]  which is already in progress as we speak another thing would be food riots
[1:42:40.860 --> 1:42:46.820]  which already are building around the world the propaganda to support such a
[1:42:46.820 --> 1:42:51.700]  development is already well well developed another thing they could do
[1:42:51.700 --> 1:42:56.540]  would be a terrorist incident another terrorist incident like the one that
[1:42:56.540 --> 1:43:04.260]  they are implicated in and on 9-11 as some kind of a nuclear incident my
[1:43:04.260 --> 1:43:10.300]  favorite my personal favorite is an epidemic because with an epidemic you
[1:43:10.300 --> 1:43:13.700]  you can't figure out yourself what happened I mean if somebody drops a bomb
[1:43:13.700 --> 1:43:16.820]  on you you know you've been attacked but with an epidemic you know people get
[1:43:16.820 --> 1:43:20.900]  sick without a conspiracy you don't even know you're under attack they've also
[1:43:20.900 --> 1:43:24.380]  been killing all the microbiologists and key government weapons programs who
[1:43:24.380 --> 1:43:28.500]  could identify the signature of where it came from exactly by the way cops you're
[1:43:28.500 --> 1:43:32.420]  not gonna when you're dying from this remember your bosses did it not us go
[1:43:32.420 --> 1:43:40.900]  ahead so any one of these and could be the the incident that provokes the
[1:43:40.900 --> 1:43:46.060]  imposition of the the martial law that's already been set in place through all
[1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:51.020]  of the legislation that they've that they've said in place the Patriot Act
[1:43:51.020 --> 1:43:55.980]  that the congressmen were not allowed to read at Patriot Act 2 and that they
[1:43:55.980 --> 1:43:59.860]  denied the existence of until it was exposed I guess you were one of the
[1:43:59.860 --> 1:44:04.060]  people who exposed the existence of of Patriot Act 2 and then they lied and
[1:44:04.060 --> 1:44:06.860]  said it didn't exist and then later admitted it how many times have they
[1:44:06.860 --> 1:44:11.660]  even caught lying I mean this government is illegitimate it's it's it's it's I
[1:44:11.660 --> 1:44:16.460]  mean it's ridiculous we even have to say that it's totally criminal and they
[1:44:16.460 --> 1:44:20.660]  staged the terror attacks knowing we're waking up to enslave us that's their
[1:44:20.660 --> 1:44:25.020]  excuse that's their smoke screen to set it up and I will tell you one of the
[1:44:25.020 --> 1:44:30.220]  though the biggest obstacles to the restoration of the Constitution and our
[1:44:30.220 --> 1:44:34.460]  freedoms Alex one of the biggest obstacles maybe the biggest is the
[1:44:34.460 --> 1:44:41.260]  Republican Party and because the Republican Party poses as the the
[1:44:41.260 --> 1:44:47.540]  institution the entity that is as you said during our conversation that is
[1:44:47.540 --> 1:44:52.580]  defending our freedom that is working for the Constitution when in fact it's
[1:44:52.580 --> 1:45:00.980]  its main purpose today is to keep the lid on to impose all of these totalitarian
[1:45:00.980 --> 1:45:06.420]  Nazi communist controls yeah that's it all they do is act like they're fighting
[1:45:06.420 --> 1:45:11.340]  the liberals and then just put out kind of a good fairy tale on issues that
[1:45:11.340 --> 1:45:15.380]  aren't important they never get to hard of the matter it's all a big pipe dream
[1:45:15.380 --> 1:45:19.460]  it's all a big distraction all misdirection and then I can't believe
[1:45:19.460 --> 1:45:22.460]  that Michelle Malkin and Free Republic and all these fake conservative sites
[1:45:22.460 --> 1:45:26.260]  they go in there and really call us liberal and really say the NAU isn't
[1:45:26.260 --> 1:45:29.820]  real and really say there isn't none control happening I mean how do their
[1:45:29.820 --> 1:45:34.700]  members not know that it's totally fake because it's that the Republican Party
[1:45:34.700 --> 1:45:40.660]  that keeps the lid on these zombie Republicans and in this sense it would
[1:45:40.660 --> 1:45:44.940]  be less dangerous for them I know this sounds incredible maybe ladies and
[1:45:44.940 --> 1:45:49.980]  gentlemen if you're hearing this for the first time it would be less dangerous to
[1:45:49.980 --> 1:45:56.540]  the country if Hillary or Obama were elected than if McCain were elected
[1:45:56.540 --> 1:46:01.580]  because typically when one of these phony Republicans is elected the people
[1:46:01.580 --> 1:46:06.660]  say well we finally won the battle let's go fishing and that allows the
[1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:12.300]  establishment to impose more and more of these totalitarian controls while if
[1:46:12.300 --> 1:46:17.740]  if a liberal Democrat is elected why then you've got the Republicans up in
[1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:21.700]  arms where we've got to protect the Constitution and that doesn't mean by
[1:46:21.700 --> 1:46:26.500]  the way I literally want to go fishing and I I can't go fishing for 12 15
[1:46:26.500 --> 1:46:31.140]  years but I understand why they want to believe the lie you want to believe
[1:46:31.140 --> 1:46:35.780]  everything's okay but it's not okay well of course you don't want to
[1:46:35.780 --> 1:46:41.020]  believe this I understand that I sympathize with that sentiment but if you
[1:46:41.020 --> 1:46:45.060]  do not face what you are looking at if you do not face what's right in front of
[1:46:45.060 --> 1:46:49.780]  you what you know is happening ladies and gentlemen you are literally going to
[1:46:49.780 --> 1:46:55.060]  be destroyed I wish I were exaggerating I'm not well that's the thing I mean
[1:46:55.060 --> 1:46:59.660]  these globalist they're not just running prostitutes and drugs and laundering
[1:46:59.660 --> 1:47:03.700]  money and inflating the currency to tens of trillions so they can buy up real
[1:47:03.700 --> 1:47:07.860]  infrastructure at our expense leaving us holding the bill I mean there's no
[1:47:07.860 --> 1:47:12.380]  future financially I mean that's the best part of it they mean of all the
[1:47:12.380 --> 1:47:17.300]  horrible panopticon of bad things Alan as you know that is the best that you
[1:47:17.300 --> 1:47:21.100]  know that's the least worse here I mean they the globalists really are you
[1:47:21.100 --> 1:47:25.060]  Genesis they really do put cancer viruses in the vaccines they really do
[1:47:25.060 --> 1:47:31.020]  put poison in our water they really are the the champions of evil I mean they
[1:47:31.020 --> 1:47:35.820]  are so evil it's hard for me to even consciously grasp the admitted documents
[1:47:35.820 --> 1:47:40.460]  we have I mean that's one of the things they have going for them you know if
[1:47:40.460 --> 1:47:46.500]  you if you say well so-and-so is convicted of embezzlement well all
[1:47:46.500 --> 1:47:50.780]  right you wouldn't embezzle yourself but it's a crime you can understand it's
[1:47:50.780 --> 1:47:58.260]  which within the realm of possible human experience but when you hear that
[1:47:58.260 --> 1:48:03.540]  these people want to eliminate a few billion not million but a few billion
[1:48:03.540 --> 1:48:08.020]  people exterminate them if this is something you cannot get your mind
[1:48:08.020 --> 1:48:15.780]  around that the the the the fact that the bald fact is too unbelievable and
[1:48:15.780 --> 1:48:19.900]  another aspect of this I think is worth mentioning is these people are almost
[1:48:19.900 --> 1:48:26.420]  universally charming they are typical psychopaths and so most of them are
[1:48:26.420 --> 1:48:34.220]  silver-toned silver-toned take a take an example here everybody remembers we're Ted Bundy Ted Bundy
[1:48:34.220 --> 1:48:40.220]  I've investigated Ted Bundy a little bit huh this is a man who killed well they
[1:48:40.220 --> 1:48:44.420]  never will know how many women he killed that they think they know that he killed
[1:48:44.420 --> 1:48:48.820]  30 some odd women but there are so many other women who disappeared that Ted
[1:48:48.820 --> 1:48:52.100]  Bundy may have killed they will never be able to establish this it was
[1:48:52.100 --> 1:48:57.420]  obviously many more women than than 30 he could even trick the judge to like him
[1:48:57.420 --> 1:49:02.100]  exactly now how could he do that he would he would meet these women and they
[1:49:02.100 --> 1:49:07.980]  would go with him why the man was apparently infinitely charming and was
[1:49:07.980 --> 1:49:12.980]  able to to deceive these women into going off with him to a place where he
[1:49:12.980 --> 1:49:19.460]  could murder them well thank God thank God Ted Bundy didn't have any political
[1:49:19.460 --> 1:49:25.180]  aspirations he could have wound up as secretary of state president well as you
[1:49:25.180 --> 1:49:30.820]  know as you know in advanced criminology and in advanced psychology but in 101
[1:49:30.820 --> 1:49:34.660]  when you look at psychopaths they do seek the the they call them more
[1:49:34.660 --> 1:49:39.220]  intelligent more dangerous time and this is 101 it's a big secret they seek
[1:49:39.220 --> 1:49:44.540]  law enforcement and government power and that's where they are and that's the
[1:49:44.540 --> 1:49:49.860]  thing they own and run everything they like to kill us it's fun take a look at
[1:49:49.860 --> 1:49:58.460]  we saw Hillary lie boldly about running for cover under sniper fire notice her
[1:49:58.460 --> 1:50:05.420]  reaction when she's exposed if you and I had told a lie so blatant and were caught
[1:50:05.420 --> 1:50:10.700]  we would be mortified humiliated our faces would turn red her reaction is
[1:50:10.700 --> 1:50:16.540]  well yeah you caught me all right on to the next lie this is this is basically
[1:50:16.540 --> 1:50:21.860]  basically her reaction and the public is being acclimated to just accept evil
[1:50:21.860 --> 1:50:28.140]  from our government exactly exactly they are being we are being programmed to
[1:50:28.140 --> 1:50:31.620]  accept whatever the government it's like the news last night they admitted they
[1:50:31.620 --> 1:50:36.380]  said well he didn't do a breathalyzer so they pepper sprayed him and beat him up
[1:50:36.380 --> 1:50:40.740]  and they work but it's like that's good there's no law you've got to do their
[1:50:40.740 --> 1:50:45.380]  breathalyzer we'll be right back stay there it's just I'm sick of it don't

[1:54:55.820 --> 1:55:00.660]  back to Alan staying Alan you are such a treasure during the break I was just
[1:55:00.660 --> 1:55:05.660]  thinking again about how they keep calling us land of the free home of the
[1:55:05.660 --> 1:55:09.580]  brave this was land of the free home of the brave we did have the most patents
[1:55:09.580 --> 1:55:12.700]  and were the toughest and were the meanest and other countries wrote books
[1:55:12.700 --> 1:55:17.980]  about us and agreed now we are hated we're fat we're unhealthy we've got the
[1:55:17.980 --> 1:55:22.940]  lowest test scores we have the most people in prison I mean I'm not on a
[1:55:22.940 --> 1:55:27.820]  high horse here I'm fat and unhealthy the point is is that this is not freedom
[1:55:27.820 --> 1:55:35.020]  face-scanning cameras you know homeland security overrun nation I mean we are
[1:55:35.020 --> 1:55:42.060]  now a globalist enclave Alan staying let me make a point here on a crucially
[1:55:42.060 --> 1:55:48.580]  important element that we must mention here is is the church you have in in
[1:55:48.580 --> 1:55:55.140]  these teams there they are all training thousands of preachers to be part of
[1:55:55.140 --> 1:55:59.980]  these teams that will come down the street when you are taken away in the
[1:55:59.980 --> 1:56:05.900]  buses to the relocation camps to calm you down to make sure that that you do
[1:56:05.900 --> 1:56:11.620]  not react in any way that you go along peaceably without protesting I've
[1:56:11.620 --> 1:56:16.380]  actually seen I'm sure you have to Alex I but I think it's worth mentioning I've
[1:56:16.380 --> 1:56:22.460]  actually seen them interviewing preachers who talk about the fact yes
[1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:26.900]  they are being trained to do this as part of these teams and the preachers are
[1:56:26.900 --> 1:56:30.860]  quite that I've seen being interviewed quite the light with this role oh yeah
[1:56:30.860 --> 1:56:34.900]  then we have preachers all over the country video of them saying do what
[1:56:34.900 --> 1:56:38.900]  the government says being a slave is good let them take your children let
[1:56:38.900 --> 1:56:43.580]  them take your guns 26,000 of them used to the truck drivers didn't like the
[1:56:43.580 --> 1:56:46.860]  police now they've recruited half a million of them just tattle tails
[1:56:46.860 --> 1:56:53.020]  everywhere quote looking for terrorism isn't this a hallmark of every
[1:56:53.020 --> 1:56:58.260]  totalitarian dictatorship we know of Hitler Stalin Cuba the neighborhood
[1:56:58.260 --> 1:57:03.060]  watch you have spies in your block isn't this what we've been told for years is
[1:57:03.060 --> 1:57:06.500]  a hallmark of a totalitarian. Well they've now federalized they've now they
[1:57:06.500 --> 1:57:10.100]  send out letters to all the neighborhood watches and the people go and they say
[1:57:10.100 --> 1:57:13.340]  you're here to fight terror now let's get down to business does your neighbor
[1:57:13.340 --> 1:57:16.580]  have plants that look like this in their backyard do you see someone spanking your
[1:57:16.580 --> 1:57:20.460]  child and the feds they then call the police on them it's literally turning
[1:57:20.460 --> 1:57:23.980]  them into spies they just get them there under the name of terror then once they
[1:57:23.980 --> 1:57:27.540]  get there they say you're spying on your neighbor we're fighting crime crime is
[1:57:27.540 --> 1:57:33.300]  terror go ahead exactly they have perverted all of these issues and
[1:57:33.300 --> 1:57:39.220]  remember it all started with the war on drugs most people forget that years ago
[1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:43.860]  in the 70s in the 70s we were told we're fighting drugs for the children well
[1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:47.260]  golly if it's for the children we have to do it I mean if you don't do this
[1:57:47.260 --> 1:57:51.740]  you're against the children so we were fighting the drugs we were told and that
[1:57:51.740 --> 1:57:55.340]  led to all of these and again the government had to fight drugs and knock
[1:57:55.340 --> 1:58:01.900]  out their competition to ensure they jacked up the price I used to think
[1:58:01.900 --> 1:58:06.180]  that we fought World War two because we hated commune communism and
[1:58:06.180 --> 1:58:11.860]  Hitlerism and now I find out no it's that we love the Hitlerism and fascism so
[1:58:11.860 --> 1:58:16.220]  much we wanted a monopoly no that's it stay there Alan Stang we're gonna do

[2:00:02.180 --> 2:00:21.540]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[2:00:25.300 --> 2:00:30.180]  Alan Stang as our guest for the next five minutes Alan been on this for about
[2:00:30.180 --> 2:00:34.260]  an hour and the five minutes we've got left always like to ask a guest what are
[2:00:34.260 --> 2:00:38.260]  other key points you want to make other issues you want to impart to our
[2:00:38.260 --> 2:00:45.860]  worldwide audience one thing I think is very important to be aware of ladies
[2:00:45.860 --> 2:00:54.140]  and gentlemen is the only reason I see that we still have some viability that
[2:00:54.140 --> 2:00:58.860]  we can fight back that we can can expose all this the only reason that that
[2:00:58.860 --> 2:01:05.180]  very encouragingly so many Americans are are now waking up is the is the
[2:01:05.180 --> 2:01:09.980]  presence of the Internet without the Internet there would be no Alex Jones
[2:01:09.980 --> 2:01:15.020]  you never would have heard of him the Internet is a tool remember that that
[2:01:15.020 --> 2:01:24.060]  got out of control it got out of out of the the hands of the conspirators who
[2:01:24.060 --> 2:01:30.060]  devised it it originally was intended to be a technique a method of
[2:01:30.060 --> 2:01:34.500]  communicating among themselves the universities the government and the
[2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:40.420]  big institutions the foundations it got out of control I believe they never
[2:01:40.420 --> 2:01:48.100]  expected that it could become what it has become and so it's it's it's the now
[2:01:48.100 --> 2:01:53.340]  the only tool that we have to communicate to inform you about what's
[2:01:53.340 --> 2:01:57.980]  going on and that tells me that that the conspiracy for world government is
[2:01:57.980 --> 2:02:04.980]  going to do something to try to destroy it I I don't know yet what they will try
[2:02:04.980 --> 2:02:08.780]  to do that there have been various techniques they've tried but one thing
[2:02:08.780 --> 2:02:14.500]  that that worries them no doubt is the fact that if they try to destroy the
[2:02:14.500 --> 2:02:20.780]  Internet the many Internet experts the so-called nerds around the country who
[2:02:20.780 --> 2:02:28.500]  can who can hack the DOD website they they they have broken into DOD I'm sure
[2:02:28.500 --> 2:02:33.020]  that the conspirators are afraid of them so they have that they have a quandary
[2:02:33.020 --> 2:02:37.380]  that they have to solve but this is something I think we should all be
[2:02:37.380 --> 2:02:41.500]  aware of because if they destroy the Internet you're not going to have any
[2:02:41.500 --> 2:02:45.620]  more Alex Jones you're not going to have any more of these programs well you
[2:02:45.620 --> 2:02:49.060]  wouldn't have an Alan stang either because right now all of my pieces
[2:02:49.060 --> 2:02:54.460]  appear regularly on the Internet so I'm sure that they're going to do something
[2:02:54.460 --> 2:03:00.220]  to try to destroy it and I would warn you ladies gentlemen to be on a special
[2:03:00.220 --> 2:03:06.220]  alert for such an attempt I have no doubt that it will come well I agree
[2:03:06.220 --> 2:03:12.020]  with you and they admittedly have a plan to kill the web and there are this new
[2:03:12.020 --> 2:03:16.380]  government report that was just put out and there's a new book out where the
[2:03:16.380 --> 2:03:19.820]  head of the Kissinger group is bragging about how they're going to shut the
[2:03:19.820 --> 2:03:24.780]  web down and create world government I mean he doesn't even mince words and
[2:03:24.780 --> 2:03:27.620]  they admit it's Internet to they're going to let the old Internet die not up
[2:03:27.620 --> 2:03:32.020]  keep it not updated and then force you on Internet to where your track trace
[2:03:32.020 --> 2:03:36.100]  regulated controlled and where speeches controlled because it's quote private
[2:03:36.100 --> 2:03:39.260]  corporate and well it's private you don't have a right to free speech in a
[2:03:39.260 --> 2:03:43.340]  private area so see it's it's that's what they do they let us build something
[2:03:43.340 --> 2:03:48.100]  and pay for it with our tax money and our and our IP fees and our connection
[2:03:48.100 --> 2:03:53.060]  fees and then they just take it away from us exactly exactly and this is what
[2:03:53.060 --> 2:03:57.260]  we need to be especially aware of because again consider ladies and
[2:03:57.260 --> 2:04:02.220]  gentlemen you have no other way of finding out what's happening you
[2:04:02.220 --> 2:04:06.260]  certainly can't depend on on shallow Sean Hannah to it to tell you what's
[2:04:06.260 --> 2:04:08.940]  happening have you ever heard him mention any of the things that we've
[2:04:08.940 --> 2:04:15.100]  discussed here in this this hour Alex and I know I and you certainly can't
[2:04:15.100 --> 2:04:18.900]  depend on the communist broadcasting system or the communist news network

[2:08:28.660 --> 2:08:34.100]  part of the newscast when I was live with a raldo Rivera Saturday night here it
[2:08:34.100 --> 2:08:38.380]  is me now from Austin Texas the well-known radio host himself the
[2:08:38.380 --> 2:08:41.940]  conspiracy theorist and documentary filmmaker alex jones alex interviewed
[2:08:41.940 --> 2:08:45.700]  Deborah palfrey in March of this year when she told him what you just heard
[2:08:45.700 --> 2:08:49.900]  that she would never commit suicide so alex welcome what do you think do you
[2:08:49.900 --> 2:08:55.100]  believe this to be as the authorities say it is her old of first off thanks for
[2:08:55.100 --> 2:08:59.460]  having me on she was a very nice lady a very genteel there's no doubt in my mind
[2:08:59.460 --> 2:09:02.860]  that she was murdered let me just go through some of the basic evidence she
[2:09:02.860 --> 2:09:06.660]  told me repeatedly on my radio show and those interviews are posted in full wars
[2:09:06.660 --> 2:09:10.260]  dot com in full that she would never kill herself that she wasn't planning to
[2:09:10.260 --> 2:09:13.620]  kill herself I pressed her during breaks in front of the board ops I said
[2:09:13.620 --> 2:09:18.500]  listen this is dangerous you've got to say who these people were you know do you
[2:09:18.500 --> 2:09:21.820]  know and she said well I'm not gonna say I just want this all to end and I said
[2:09:21.820 --> 2:09:25.540]  you've got to say who it was you're not safe she said listen I'll never kill
[2:09:25.540 --> 2:09:30.060]  myself if they claim that I was murdered so we have a tape of her saying she
[2:09:30.060 --> 2:09:34.940]  wouldn't commit suicide now NBC in Florida where she had a condo was
[2:09:34.940 --> 2:09:38.540]  reporting that one of her friends who was the manager of the high-rise condos
[2:09:38.540 --> 2:09:43.260]  and he's on tape saying two days before she was killed before she died she left
[2:09:43.260 --> 2:09:47.220]  to her mothers and said look I'm being followed I think there's a contract out
[2:09:47.220 --> 2:09:51.740]  on me I'm not gonna kill myself this is on tape then you look at Brandy
[2:09:51.740 --> 2:09:57.500]  Britton she was facing six months in jail last year shot her mouth off miss
[2:09:57.500 --> 2:10:01.220]  Palfrey said that EC madam said and said I'm gonna talk about who my Johns are
[2:10:01.220 --> 2:10:05.100]  this is hypocritical she was a professor you know she had a psychology
[2:10:05.100 --> 2:10:08.100]  degree she was saying this is hypocritical I'm gonna tell who my Johns were
[2:10:08.100 --> 2:10:11.340]  and then she hangs herself number one her all though you've covered a lot of
[2:10:11.340 --> 2:10:15.020]  criminology you know women don't normally hang themselves first one of her
[2:10:15.020 --> 2:10:21.300]  through girls kills herself now she kills himself take pills exactly and on
[2:10:21.300 --> 2:10:25.340]  top of it her in fact 90% of women take pills that's why they do it now now men
[2:10:25.340 --> 2:10:29.140]  shoot themselves and hang themselves now on top of it her mother said she was
[2:10:29.140 --> 2:10:33.620]  happy saying she was gonna fight it let me take a break standby right there I
[2:10:33.620 --> 2:10:42.140]  have Judge Pirro and Kim Gilpoir also right back just a second before I
[2:10:42.140 --> 2:10:47.260]  continue our discussion on the death of Debra Jean Palfrey the so-called DC
[2:10:47.260 --> 2:10:53.060]  madam who the authorities say committed suicide but some have doubts Alex Jones
[2:10:53.060 --> 2:10:58.940]  the popular radio host who interviewed Debra Jean Palfrey had been saying just
[2:10:58.940 --> 2:11:04.580]  before the the commercial break that she the DC madam was a happy person want
[2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:09.020]  to finish that thought out and I get on to our other guests well her all though
[2:11:09.020 --> 2:11:12.820]  it's just that she told her mother she told the person that managed the condos
[2:11:12.820 --> 2:11:16.580]  where she lived and she was friends with everybody that she was gonna go on and
[2:11:16.580 --> 2:11:20.620]  gonna fight others that knew her said that she was gonna write a book when
[2:11:20.620 --> 2:11:25.340]  she got out in about six to seven months could have been as many as 70
[2:11:25.340 --> 2:11:30.100]  months but certainly not 50 years as some were saying and you have two women
[2:11:30.100 --> 2:11:35.220]  hanging themselves I mean this is ridiculous with these supposed you know
[2:11:35.220 --> 2:11:40.380]  very wealthy very powerful Johns I think this is quote taking out the garbage
[2:11:40.380 --> 2:11:44.900]  somebody trying to get rid of evidence I hear you I hear you know an election
[2:11:44.900 --> 2:11:50.660]  your problem okay Alex Jones let's Alex has a reputation sometimes of being you
[2:11:50.660 --> 2:11:55.500]  know flamboyant than his opinions let's say I don't know that to be the case
[2:11:55.500 --> 2:12:01.980]  about you at all what do you say well you know I had the opportunity her all
[2:12:01.980 --> 2:12:05.620]  though to interview Debra Jean about a year ago and I talked to her about
[2:12:05.620 --> 2:12:09.500]  Brandi Britain and her suicide and what she said to me is they don't just come
[2:12:09.500 --> 2:12:13.820]  and get you they terrorize you and but she made it very clear that she was not
[2:12:13.820 --> 2:12:17.740]  made of that and I agree with you Alex not made of that means she was not
[2:12:17.740 --> 2:12:23.100]  suicidal she was a woman who had a very strong core she was a fighter from the
[2:12:23.100 --> 2:12:27.820]  get-go and one of the things she said to me her all though was that look this
[2:12:27.820 --> 2:12:32.740]  isn't about madams this isn't about prostitution this is about me suggesting
[2:12:32.740 --> 2:12:36.540]  that there was no government program to take down prostitutes if there was a
[2:12:36.540 --> 2:12:41.500]  program she believed to take her down think about it you've got a top state
[2:12:41.500 --> 2:12:45.580]  department official you've got a military strategist a United States senator
[2:12:45.580 --> 2:12:50.540]  you've got all of these individuals lobbyists paying for prostitutes at the
[2:12:50.540 --> 2:12:53.300]  same time you've got the head of the Maryland state police who's being
[2:12:53.300 --> 2:12:57.380]  indicted and convicted for using the executive protection unit to move the
[2:12:57.380 --> 2:13:02.020]  prostitutes around you've got a federal prosecutor at that time who was murdered
[2:13:02.020 --> 2:13:06.620]  and who yet his case is unsolved you've got all kinds of corruption going on
[2:13:06.620 --> 2:13:10.620]  it's a Jonathan Luna and indeed I have the book the midnight ride of Jonathan
[2:13:10.620 --> 2:13:14.540]  Luna for anyone interested everything raises a death in Billy Gilford
[2:13:14.540 --> 2:13:18.300]  as the lineup as a former prosecutor right away when I heard that this was an
[2:13:18.300 --> 2:13:22.420]  apparent suicide I couldn't believe it I was doubtful from the get-go if I was a
[2:13:22.420 --> 2:13:26.140]  prosecutor on this case I would make sure and investigate it very thoroughly I
[2:13:26.140 --> 2:13:30.340]  think it's far too coincidental that the two women involved in this would both
[2:13:30.340 --> 2:13:34.060]  hang themselves right there I think it is cause for suspicion is the Justice
[2:13:34.060 --> 2:13:38.420]  Department sealing the names of the Johns when they could very easily be
[2:13:38.420 --> 2:13:44.740]  indicting them let me start this way Alex I want to thank you because you really have shined some
[2:13:44.740 --> 2:13:48.780]  important light on this case I just want to say one thing here I call on
[2:13:48.780 --> 2:13:53.780]  Governor Charlie Christ who's a great guy an honest guy a straight shooter to
[2:13:53.780 --> 2:13:58.220]  have his attorney general investigate the apparent suicide of Deborah Jane
[2:13:58.220 --> 2:14:02.580]  Palfrey because if these three people are all agreed and I tend to agree with
[2:14:02.580 --> 2:14:09.060]  them this is too perfect this is too stinky to pass this thing there's more
[2:14:09.060 --> 2:14:12.620]  Alex you've got to tell me another time because I got a million things to talk
[2:14:12.620 --> 2:14:15.900]  about on the show but she was paid up six months she wanted to make sure that
[2:14:15.900 --> 2:14:21.700]  her good point of here investigate this it does not all right and then it ended
[2:14:21.700 --> 2:14:26.180]  with him to call the governor for an investigation and I tried to throw in and
[2:14:26.180 --> 2:14:29.220]  I messed up there then because they're interrupting you know I wasn't six months
[2:14:29.220 --> 2:14:38.380]  she was paid up on her fees for six years she she told him I'm paying up for
[2:14:38.380 --> 2:14:44.460]  six years I'm gonna be out in six years I'm paying my fees for my condo she
[2:14:44.460 --> 2:14:47.700]  didn't sign the condo over to her mother she didn't make preparations for that
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:51.740]  she was there to help her mother out financially hadn't even gotten those
[2:14:51.740 --> 2:14:57.940]  those preparations completed yet the only child her mother ill live you know
[2:14:57.940 --> 2:15:01.540]  people made fun of Palfrey saying oh look she's rich her mother's in a trailer
[2:15:01.540 --> 2:15:05.100]  it was actually a pretty nice trailer in a pretty nice area one of those double
[2:15:05.100 --> 2:15:09.820]  wides with a shed and the rest of it built on to it had a lot of folks live
[2:15:09.820 --> 2:15:12.940]  there because your house gets destroyed all the time from hurricanes why should
[2:15:12.940 --> 2:15:16.700]  you build something fancy that's kind of a something you see there in Florida but
[2:15:16.700 --> 2:15:21.180]  but I'm I'm digressing she was upbeat to her mother she was saying she was gonna
[2:15:21.180 --> 2:15:28.220]  appeal it she was gonna expose them her mother said that the the manager of the
[2:15:28.220 --> 2:15:32.220]  high-rise condos I'm gonna repeat said she was said she was being followed she
[2:15:32.220 --> 2:15:38.460]  thought there was a contract hit out on her now to be clear off air with her
[2:15:38.460 --> 2:15:43.220]  during several interviews I would say listen you better name names if it's
[2:15:43.220 --> 2:15:50.300]  Dick Cheney like Wayne Madsen saying this is dangerous he said look she goes I
[2:15:50.300 --> 2:15:53.420]  know they're listening right now I don't want any trouble I just want to retire
[2:15:53.420 --> 2:15:58.180]  this isn't fair what they're doing to me I don't want to name names and I'm
[2:15:58.180 --> 2:16:03.340]  like yeah but they're not gonna stop cuz you know who they are this is another
[2:16:03.340 --> 2:16:06.860]  person that just can't get through their head that they're going to kill you
[2:16:06.860 --> 2:16:10.220]  people can't believe that they're gonna be killed people think they're bullet
[2:16:10.220 --> 2:16:14.460]  proof you are not bullet proof believe me I know I'm not bullet proof when I
[2:16:14.460 --> 2:16:18.220]  tell a story about about being stabbed or a story about somebody pulling a gun
[2:16:18.220 --> 2:16:22.340]  on me or a story about some guy at a party for no reason putting a knife up
[2:16:22.340 --> 2:16:26.180]  to my neck and saying he was gonna kill me so hard blood was coming out that is
[2:16:26.180 --> 2:16:32.980]  it to act tough that really happened so I've been in a bad car wreck where you're
[2:16:32.980 --> 2:16:36.980]  all broke up and you know I've been in a you know and I'm I've been saying I'm a
[2:16:36.980 --> 2:16:41.020]  tough guy the point is I know I'm fragile I've seen friends die I've seen
[2:16:41.020 --> 2:16:44.260]  other people die I've seen people die on the side of the highway right in front
[2:16:44.260 --> 2:16:50.860]  of me and I think the general public is delusional and doesn't realize how easy
[2:16:50.860 --> 2:16:56.380]  people break how soon death comes to us all it's kind of like Christmas time when
[2:16:56.380 --> 2:16:59.820]  you were a kid you'd wait and wait and waited it would never come and pretty
[2:16:59.820 --> 2:17:08.060]  soon it came and then as you're an adult decades just flashed by and that's how
[2:17:08.060 --> 2:17:12.500]  life is you're gonna wake up 90 years old on your deathbed or you're gonna
[2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:18.740]  wake up in slow motion as a car runs a red light and t-bones you and kills you
[2:17:18.740 --> 2:17:24.380]  and your children in your car some of you out there listening
[2:17:28.180 --> 2:17:34.940]  and so I mean I'm telling people call me a conspiracy theorist why do we almost
[2:17:34.940 --> 2:17:38.420]  always get the big story and nobody else does in this movement well I mean I
[2:17:38.420 --> 2:17:43.340]  knew Deborah Jean Palfrey was big there in Virginia in DC in Maryland tied in I
[2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:47.380]  know they don't raid these escort services unless there's some political
[2:17:47.380 --> 2:17:51.820]  reason I knew it was hypocritical when when when all these big names came out
[2:17:51.820 --> 2:17:56.460]  I said oh I better interview her and so nobody else thought to ask her hey don't
[2:17:56.460 --> 2:18:01.380]  you think they're gonna kill you I mean I'm in the real world that's why I
[2:18:01.380 --> 2:18:07.060]  asked her that that's why I got the quotes that's why I'm on the news because
[2:18:07.060 --> 2:18:14.860]  I know how things work I'm realistic I do think 3, 4, 5, 6 steps ahead and I'm
[2:18:14.860 --> 2:18:22.180]  not even that smart it's that I am thinking a few steps ahead you can all
[2:18:22.180 --> 2:18:27.140]  do that too here's an example I told people a decade ago that they take your
[2:18:27.140 --> 2:18:30.740]  blood at birth for any legal federal database it's mainstream news this
[2:18:30.740 --> 2:18:38.660]  weekend Bush signs bill to take all newborn DNA at birth now why are they
[2:18:38.660 --> 2:18:42.420]  doing that why did they pass a law saying you get NSA spy on people without
[2:18:42.420 --> 2:18:45.820]  warrants retroactively because he and others in the telecommunications
[2:18:45.820 --> 2:18:51.140]  companies we're gonna go to prison and so they had to retroactively pass a law
[2:18:51.140 --> 2:18:56.340]  for crimes they committed it's the same thing here we for a decade have had
[2:18:56.340 --> 2:19:00.460]  congressmen on experts on we've called for lawsuits lawsuits have been started
[2:19:00.460 --> 2:19:08.180]  Bush says hey I'll just sign a bill saying we take your blood at birth is
[2:19:08.180 --> 2:19:11.260]  that land of the free home of the brave and by the way it goes into Homeland
[2:19:11.260 --> 2:19:17.900]  Security health council Ron Paul war new lock and pave the way for national
[2:19:17.900 --> 2:19:25.100]  DNA database pave the way we've had one for 35 years that's why I'm always ahead
[2:19:25.100 --> 2:19:30.180]  of the curve because I'm not reading conspiracy websites folks I'm reading
[2:19:30.180 --> 2:19:34.700]  think tank documents I'm reading university studies I'm in source
[2:19:34.700 --> 2:19:39.460]  documents I spend about four hours a day doing and I'm addicted to it and I
[2:19:39.460 --> 2:19:43.620]  know exactly what they're gonna do I know they've implanted you with cancer

[2:25:04.340 --> 2:25:07.340]  I'm Alex Jones your host for the next two hours
[2:25:07.340 --> 2:25:21.580]  we've got Alan Watt researcher author musician we're honored to have him on
[2:25:21.580 --> 2:25:29.180]  with us today I had a lot of news items I want to bring up to him but before we do
[2:25:29.180 --> 2:25:32.820]  that let's just ask him in this short segment what he'd like to talk about in
[2:25:32.820 --> 2:25:37.860]  the next two hours with us today Alan Watt thanks for coming on yes a pleasure
[2:25:37.860 --> 2:25:42.260]  to be here yeah what what is most on your mind today what do you want to break
[2:25:42.260 --> 2:25:46.020]  down for my audience today I mean I want to get into the behavioral psychologists
[2:25:46.020 --> 2:25:50.340]  the false paradigm the reality we're in how to break out of that solutions for
[2:25:50.340 --> 2:25:54.420]  people to deprogram themselves where you see things going in the next step in
[2:25:54.420 --> 2:25:59.780]  their phase but those are some of the issues I want to raise but what do you
[2:25:59.780 --> 2:26:04.940]  think is most important to talk about today Alan Watt I think it's the even
[2:26:04.940 --> 2:26:09.020]  bigger picture because well all of this is going on all of this is really
[2:26:09.020 --> 2:26:15.540]  happening and society has been altered drastically quickly in so many areas all
[2:26:15.540 --> 2:26:21.020]  of it all of its facets in fact to make up culture even global society that
[2:26:21.020 --> 2:26:26.220]  you're finding the rushing ahead with the genetic research which is all to do
[2:26:26.220 --> 2:26:32.860]  with the the old old plan of protecting society the way they want to perfect it
[2:26:32.860 --> 2:26:38.460]  meaning to bring in a good class of servant slaves playing God so so they're
[2:26:38.460 --> 2:26:41.620]  already talking about designer babies they're already looking at the genetics
[2:26:41.620 --> 2:26:44.740]  and having social workers putting two-year-olds for as little as for at
[2:26:44.740 --> 2:26:50.140]  least three years in England Canada on databases a crime because of your
[2:26:50.140 --> 2:26:55.780]  genetics made up quackery as they play God yes and even Bush and the rest of
[2:26:55.780 --> 2:27:00.220]  the signed the bills for all newborn babies to have their DNA collected at
[2:27:00.220 --> 2:27:03.940]  birth and this is nothing to do with the health of those children as the parents
[2:27:03.940 --> 2:27:07.780]  see it is to do to see if you recalculate you carry with what they
[2:27:07.780 --> 2:27:12.860]  call recessive genes genes which are throwbacks to previous racial
[2:27:12.860 --> 2:27:17.620]  mixtures and and so on and of course you aren't listening earlier were you no
[2:27:17.620 --> 2:27:21.820]  I didn't think you were always on the same page it seems I was covering how
[2:27:21.820 --> 2:27:25.900]  Bush signed bill to take all newborns DNA now they admit this program's been
[2:27:25.900 --> 2:27:29.540]  at really going on for 35 years they're just now having to do this because it
[2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:33.880]  got exposed and they were being sued so he's retroactively trying to give them
[2:27:33.880 --> 2:27:38.340]  liability protection but they admit and I've spent days reading University of
[2:27:38.340 --> 2:27:42.980]  Texas runs it in the US they have universities globally doing it in each
[2:27:42.980 --> 2:27:47.380]  country and they admit in there that it's used for homeland security and
[2:27:47.380 --> 2:27:51.300]  criminal database it's used for genetic engineering and it's given to the
[2:27:51.300 --> 2:27:55.020]  insurance companies your complete map and they admitted that they are looking
[2:27:55.020 --> 2:27:59.900]  for certain key racial traits just like the human genome project is run by the
[2:27:59.900 --> 2:28:04.700]  eugenicists for making specific bio weapons to kill some of us but also to
[2:28:04.700 --> 2:28:08.900]  use traits for the elite in their life extension well there's no doubt about
[2:28:08.900 --> 2:28:14.100]  this this goes all the way back to the 1800s when they set up the first
[2:28:14.100 --> 2:28:19.740]  censorship or census collection databases with the Carnegie Institute and the
[2:28:19.740 --> 2:28:24.620]  backing of Congress and Charles Davenport was behind that in 1890 and
[2:28:24.620 --> 2:28:29.460]  they wanted from then on everyone to have an 11-digit number they could track
[2:28:29.460 --> 2:28:33.700]  you down through your family history and follow your offspring and collect the
[2:28:33.700 --> 2:28:39.300]  medical data that was the most important stuff they wanted all medical data to do
[2:28:39.300 --> 2:28:44.940]  with what problems you carried in your genes and this is still going on
[2:28:44.940 --> 2:28:49.660]  today this is an old old plan run by the same big foundations in Cahouts
[2:28:49.660 --> 2:28:55.500]  with the global elitists but now it's 2008 and we're going to get to see it
[2:28:55.500 --> 2:28:59.980]  come to fruition there's no doubt there's no doubt at all and that they're
[2:28:59.980 --> 2:29:04.380]  also talking now about creating the new chimeras even the Catholic Church has
[2:29:04.380 --> 2:29:08.740]  got into it on behalf of the scientists strangely enough if you look at it from
[2:29:08.740 --> 2:29:14.140]  a different perspective and they say that the anyone with a part human genome
[2:29:14.140 --> 2:29:19.620]  any creature at all is therefore human in all full respects that's exactly what
[2:29:19.620 --> 2:29:24.180]  the scientists want stay there Alan Watt for listeners that are listening on the
[2:29:24.180 --> 2:29:28.900]  infowars.com streams we're going to continue the discussion for everybody
[2:29:28.900 --> 2:29:32.900]  else will be back in three minutes
[2:29:37.180 --> 2:29:46.540]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:29:46.540 --> 2:29:51.820]  wake up Protestant America there is an ecumenical movement now being planned
[2:29:51.820 --> 2:29:55.820]  to join church and state this confederation of evangelicals Catholics
[2:29:55.820 --> 2:29:59.580]  and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting block their
[2:29:59.580 --> 2:30:03.540]  agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation our
[2:30:03.540 --> 2:30:06.940]  forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom
[2:30:06.940 --> 2:30:10.220]  liberty of conscience history and the Bible proved to them that these two
[2:30:10.220 --> 2:30:14.420]  systems church and state must be kept separate it must be our love of God and
[2:30:14.420 --> 2:30:18.500]  of country that prompts or constrains us this will change the character not
[2:30:18.500 --> 2:30:22.220]  civil enforcement from history we saw that when church and state united known
[2:30:22.220 --> 2:30:25.980]  as papal Rome religious intolerance resulted this union would go directly
[2:30:25.980 --> 2:30:29.940]  contrary to the great principles of our nation America and papal Rome are
[2:30:29.940 --> 2:30:34.220]  uniting in this agenda Protestant America awake before it is too late the

[2:33:15.820 --> 2:33:19.500]  50 minutes very honored to have him you about his website and other contact
[2:33:19.500 --> 2:33:24.580]  points throughout the hours Alan I want to get into the whole genetic
[2:33:24.580 --> 2:33:29.220]  engineering angle and how they're playing God but first I want to make the
[2:33:29.220 --> 2:33:33.180]  statement that driving to work you look at the people acting more sheepish
[2:33:33.180 --> 2:33:37.820]  acting more and more stupid looking more and more dull don't even talk to their
[2:33:37.820 --> 2:33:41.540]  neighbors don't talk to each other they don't really interact they simply a
[2:33:41.540 --> 2:33:45.460]  spectator's watch television the language being reduced everyone being
[2:33:45.460 --> 2:33:49.140]  dumbed down the test scores dropping and dropping by design in their own
[2:33:49.140 --> 2:33:53.700]  declassified documents and so the elites they see they're all a bunch of dumb
[2:33:53.700 --> 2:33:57.660]  animals they deserve to die they say it's prima facie evidence that the
[2:33:57.660 --> 2:34:02.980]  population deserves to be reduced and exterminated and cold because they
[2:34:02.980 --> 2:34:06.940]  you know if they were the fittest they would be fighting back or at least
[2:34:06.940 --> 2:34:10.500]  joining the elite when you really study the global elite they actually say they
[2:34:10.500 --> 2:34:16.260]  want to catch people at birth and use genetic screening to target what they
[2:34:16.260 --> 2:34:21.700]  call kind of rogue elites they so this really I mean it's evil enough to say
[2:34:21.700 --> 2:34:25.500]  they want to dump everybody down and enslave them and kill them because that's
[2:34:25.500 --> 2:34:29.140]  what they're doing for the species but it's even worse when you really find out
[2:34:29.140 --> 2:34:33.100]  they're trying to mutate humanity dumb humanity down and that they have
[2:34:33.100 --> 2:34:38.940]  accentuated and created a feedback loop to to really turn the public into the
[2:34:38.940 --> 2:34:44.900]  self-propelled stomachs that literally can hardly think or talk so it's so
[2:34:44.900 --> 2:34:49.220]  diabolical and I want the public to know from all the gauges I have we're
[2:34:49.220 --> 2:34:53.700]  just five ten years off maybe even closer at current growth of them releasing
[2:34:53.700 --> 2:34:57.340]  the mass bioplegs they've just got to have a few more staged events to fully
[2:34:57.340 --> 2:35:02.980]  get us locked down and then they can really start the job of culling 85 to
[2:35:02.980 --> 2:35:06.300]  90% of us depending on which globalist document you see and they've done
[2:35:06.300 --> 2:35:09.180]  everything else they said they would do that's the thing we're not saying this
[2:35:09.180 --> 2:35:13.100]  for effect here they really are going to do this and they really are going to
[2:35:13.100 --> 2:35:16.060]  carry this out they really are going to kill most of you listening right now
[2:35:16.060 --> 2:35:20.980]  they're saying they're not joking they have to be taken serious Alan want your
[2:35:20.980 --> 2:35:25.100]  comments on that subject then back into and into their main push genetic
[2:35:25.100 --> 2:35:30.300]  engineering yet there's no doubt about it even to do with their ideas that came
[2:35:30.300 --> 2:35:35.420]  out within the 1800s and you had Galton in England and you had Davenport in the
[2:35:35.420 --> 2:35:40.660]  US by the Carnegie Institute and the Congress at the time they set up this
[2:35:40.660 --> 2:35:45.620]  whole eugenics experiment at Cold Springs Harbor and they called it for
[2:35:45.620 --> 2:35:50.260]  the station for experimental evolution it's a major tenet of their belief
[2:35:50.260 --> 2:35:55.940]  system is evolution and they had already come to believe at the top that some
[2:35:55.940 --> 2:36:01.180]  big leap forward had occurred in the past and that they being the elite of the
[2:36:01.180 --> 2:36:06.340]  day were the natural products of that and everything else beneath them was an
[2:36:06.340 --> 2:36:10.940]  inferior type of human and now we've seen all the headlines we've seen BBC and
[2:36:10.940 --> 2:36:16.260]  Reuters showing the superhuman and the subway dwarf goblin now they're now
[2:36:16.260 --> 2:36:21.060]  saying and and the joke is they're now saying we're the subway dwarf goblin
[2:36:21.060 --> 2:36:26.220]  and we do kind of look like that and act like that mm-hmm that's correct and the
[2:36:26.220 --> 2:36:31.700]  they said that this is another basic part of their whole philosophy is that you
[2:36:31.700 --> 2:36:37.340]  can't breed people up from the bottom and you'll bring the top down if you
[2:36:37.340 --> 2:36:41.180]  try to mix genes with with the so-called better class and inferior class and
[2:36:41.180 --> 2:36:47.220]  therefore their whole idea as far back as the 1800s was to gradually eliminate
[2:36:47.220 --> 2:36:52.100]  at the bottom class and then through understanding what became to be known as
[2:36:52.100 --> 2:36:58.900]  genetics they would create a new type of slaves to serve them but they also knew
[2:36:58.900 --> 2:37:03.580]  and Lord veteran Russell stated this that they'd have to catch children at
[2:37:03.580 --> 2:37:09.780]  school young men very early on who had leadership abilities and intellect but
[2:37:09.780 --> 2:37:14.540]  whom they knew because of the genetic lineages and by studying the parents
[2:37:14.540 --> 2:37:18.980]  and grandparents and personality types they knew they wouldn't conform and serve
[2:37:18.980 --> 2:37:22.460]  the elite they could rebel against them and therefore they'd have to pick them
[2:37:22.460 --> 2:37:27.500]  out and if necessary they'd have to to eliminate them and by the way that is in
[2:37:27.500 --> 2:37:33.700]  hundreds of government PhD documents and let me give sources now Dr. Dennis
[2:37:33.700 --> 2:37:36.540]  Cuddy of course worked at the Department of Education highest levels
[2:37:36.540 --> 2:37:40.900]  he's written several books on the subject the number two at Department of
[2:37:40.900 --> 2:37:44.820]  Education in the 80s Charlotte Isherby whose dad with skull and bones and
[2:37:44.820 --> 2:37:48.980]  Bohemian Grove East Coast elite they brought her in and she'd been in the
[2:37:48.980 --> 2:37:52.260]  Foreign Service and they put her in charge and said okay and she has a phone
[2:37:52.260 --> 2:37:56.700]  book size book that we sell by the way at info wars.com where they said
[2:37:56.700 --> 2:38:02.580]  they are meant to dumb everybody down further but also single out the
[2:38:02.580 --> 2:38:06.940]  leadership males put them on drugs to brain damage them but then take some
[2:38:06.940 --> 2:38:10.740]  select ones and make sure they're recruited into elite circles so that's
[2:38:10.740 --> 2:38:14.660]  official US government policy. That's why your little boys are
[2:38:14.660 --> 2:38:18.700]  that's why your boys are targeted go ahead. Yeah Bertrand Russell stated that
[2:38:18.700 --> 2:38:24.820]  in the 50s and 60s he said that the ones they couldn't sway over would accept
[2:38:24.820 --> 2:38:29.140]  the scholarships and some of them would have to be literally be eliminated
[2:38:29.140 --> 2:38:35.860]  destroyed but also the alternative was to as you say get them on drugs which
[2:38:35.860 --> 2:38:39.860]  would alter their brain patterns and we know that Ritalin and all the rest of
[2:38:39.860 --> 2:38:43.740]  it shrinks the brain gives them tremendous problems and it's primarily
[2:38:43.740 --> 2:38:50.020]  young men young males who are kicked out for this. Yeah a little do they know
[2:38:50.020 --> 2:38:53.180]  that their DNA's already been tested by the government decades ago they're
[2:38:53.180 --> 2:38:56.220]  already in a file everything they're doing is being tracked and then they
[2:38:56.220 --> 2:38:59.900]  make sure they destroy them and that's all official that's your loving
[2:38:59.900 --> 2:39:04.140]  government helping you you know running checkpoints to keep you safe from
[2:39:04.140 --> 2:39:08.780]  al-Qaeda. Let's get into the genetic engineering because this is important for
[2:39:08.780 --> 2:39:15.340]  those that don't know a decade ago the major scientific papers reported I
[2:39:15.340 --> 2:39:21.820]  remember reading them that they had human bovine human cow cross species
[2:39:21.820 --> 2:39:26.700]  creatures but they would kill them in the embryonic phase they had humanzies
[2:39:26.700 --> 2:39:30.860]  then the Washington Post five years ago reported that Latin American countries
[2:39:30.860 --> 2:39:36.380]  do have laboratories with humanzies you have human or part human part chimpanzee
[2:39:36.380 --> 2:39:40.860]  and then now they admit that human genes are put in the food we eat insect
[2:39:40.860 --> 2:39:45.020]  genes part spider part goat that's been around for 20 years
[2:39:45.020 --> 2:39:51.260]  remote control cockroaches robo rat that's what they've told us about and now
[2:39:51.260 --> 2:39:55.060]  they're just now introducing it to the public which means we're even more
[2:39:55.060 --> 2:39:59.780]  advanced so Alan want breakdown what we know they've got then what your sources
[2:39:59.780 --> 2:40:03.940]  have told you they really do have and then why they're hoarding this for
[2:40:03.940 --> 2:40:10.100]  themselves yeah they do have a new breed basically they can bring on at any time
[2:40:10.100 --> 2:40:14.900]  they want a new breed of servant class and I often wonder if they've not already
[2:40:14.900 --> 2:40:19.460]  introduced them to some higher levels of bureaucracies to be honest with you
[2:40:19.460 --> 2:40:24.820]  perfect servant who will not question whatever they're told to do they have no
[2:40:24.820 --> 2:40:29.940]  human qualms about things but it's still have built in fail safes to serve their
[2:40:29.940 --> 2:40:34.540]  masters it's almost like a breeding psychopaths with fail safes in them to
[2:40:34.540 --> 2:40:38.940]  serve the master that's the only difference between them really and the
[2:40:38.940 --> 2:40:44.780]  creators you might say the elite who already do exist these psychopaths can
[2:40:44.780 --> 2:40:48.380]  cooperate at the top because they're all in the same group well they don't even
[2:40:48.380 --> 2:40:51.300]  need to produce those though we know there's been programs to produce the
[2:40:51.300 --> 2:40:55.940]  super soldier they just put 100% of the troops in and they know about 30% are
[2:40:55.940 --> 2:41:00.780]  gonna come back with psychopathic breaks who already had sociopathic sadistic
[2:41:00.780 --> 2:41:05.380]  tendencies who have now been perfected into a psychopath or they can find the
[2:41:05.380 --> 2:41:07.940]  one psychopath out of a hundred that already exists but they already have
[2:41:07.940 --> 2:41:11.260]  ways to produce them and then they and then they put them into law enforcement
[2:41:11.260 --> 2:41:16.340]  well they've already started up a school I think it's in Delaware it just got to
[2:41:16.340 --> 2:41:20.700]  go ahead to go ahead for the first time under Homeland Security and it's going
[2:41:20.700 --> 2:41:23.820]  to be school to work of the only difference being that we're creating
[2:41:23.820 --> 2:41:27.580]  children from school to be going into SWAT teams something going to the
[2:41:27.580 --> 2:41:30.980]  military some oh yeah all over the country they already have that they call
[2:41:30.980 --> 2:41:34.900]  it law enforcement sixth seventh grade they write cattle tell reports on their
[2:41:34.900 --> 2:41:39.540]  parents I have video of it in my films mm-hmm road to tyranny that's seven I
[2:41:39.540 --> 2:41:42.700]  mean that's almost seven years old and you're right here in Austin but go ahead
[2:41:42.700 --> 2:41:47.420]  yeah so that they're rushing ahead with this degree and use of society while
[2:41:47.420 --> 2:41:51.540]  the adults play themselves and entertain themselves and are distracted by
[2:41:51.540 --> 2:41:58.100]  trivia and these characters remember work intergenerationally we are short term
[2:41:58.100 --> 2:42:02.620]  thinkers and planners we think in one lifespan only and we don't realize that
[2:42:02.620 --> 2:42:07.140]  these characters will go through three generations of four or more however long
[2:42:07.140 --> 2:42:11.540]  it takes to achieve their objectives and they have big foundations which outlive
[2:42:11.540 --> 2:42:15.780]  all of them and you can keep going intergenerationally and complete their
[2:42:15.780 --> 2:42:20.300]  part of their part in an agenda it's that simple they've been doing this for a
[2:42:20.300 --> 2:42:25.700]  century well if you look at who is in the 3000 CFR that really runs this
[2:42:25.700 --> 2:42:29.820]  country they're all grandsons or great-grandsons under you know the
[2:42:29.820 --> 2:42:34.860]  other family name of the Rockefellers the Carnegie's the Asters take Tucker
[2:42:34.860 --> 2:42:42.740]  Carlson take Anderson Cooper he's an aster the heir to the billions I mean
[2:42:42.740 --> 2:42:48.660]  if you look at who runs the UT CI recruiting you know who openly writes
[2:42:48.660 --> 2:42:51.300]  articles in the papers saying get rid of all freedom in America
[2:42:51.300 --> 2:42:56.820]  Mr. Bobbitt is the nephew of LBJ I mean literally it is just a few families
[2:42:56.820 --> 2:43:01.740]  it's family than it is and it's been that way for a long long time and same
[2:43:01.740 --> 2:43:06.100]  in every other country in Europe too by the way you'll find all interrelated
[2:43:06.100 --> 2:43:10.420]  these characters have been selecting their mates for centuries or having them
[2:43:10.420 --> 2:43:15.060]  done for them and they're making it up purely for their offspring and for their
[2:43:15.060 --> 2:43:20.100]  background heritage but really it's giving them health problems and not even
[2:43:20.100 --> 2:43:24.180]  advanced intelligence a lot of the time what it's actually making them do is
[2:43:24.180 --> 2:43:28.460]  is as we saw with the Pharaoh's and the Caesar's is that their psychopaths
[2:43:28.460 --> 2:43:32.780]  interbraining causes all sorts of mental illness yeah and and the
[2:43:32.780 --> 2:43:39.140]  psychopathy is an interesting topic because it isn't a normal mental illness
[2:43:39.140 --> 2:43:44.020]  as such as like Plato said thousands of years ago speaking on behalf of the
[2:43:44.020 --> 2:43:48.940]  psychopaths of that day he said that he being a member of the aristocracy had
[2:43:48.940 --> 2:43:53.740]  been specially bred as all aristocracy was specially bred and he said just like
[2:43:53.740 --> 2:43:59.620]  animals domesticated animals you can breed equality in or out and for those
[2:43:59.620 --> 2:44:04.540]  who rule over the lesser people you don't want to breed in someone that with
[2:44:04.540 --> 2:44:09.340]  emotional tendencies so you breed out the emotional tendencies and you end up
[2:44:09.340 --> 2:44:15.380]  with these these very very cold and calculating and cunning people but they
[2:44:15.380 --> 2:44:20.940]  have no human empathy for other others around them but I also noticed the type
[2:44:20.940 --> 2:44:24.580]  who they're very cold-blooded they're very neurotic they're very obsessive
[2:44:24.580 --> 2:44:28.300]  compulsive you know reading about David Rockefeller Prince Philip all of them
[2:44:28.300 --> 2:44:31.580]  even being around really wealthy and I mean really wealthy people is that every
[2:44:31.580 --> 2:44:34.780]  the yard's got to be cut right every light bulbs got to be in the bank
[2:44:34.780 --> 2:44:38.740]  accounts got to be perfect and it is that attention to detail and complex
[2:44:38.740 --> 2:44:42.620]  things that allows them to maintain control but they also enjoy the cold
[2:44:42.620 --> 2:44:47.660]  crushing of beauty they are very envious of beautiful young people they are very
[2:44:47.660 --> 2:44:52.300]  jealous of happy independent people they have a real pleasure in murdering
[2:44:52.300 --> 2:44:56.780]  masses of people it's it's it's a power trip it's a power thing and that
[2:44:56.780 --> 2:45:01.220]  control even at the obsessional control you mentioned in compulsive behavior is
[2:45:01.220 --> 2:45:06.980]  part of control anything at all even something in a house that's out of place
[2:45:06.980 --> 2:45:11.780]  or a picture that's kind of squint on the wall that will distract them and they
[2:45:11.780 --> 2:45:15.460]  have to have it rectified because everything must be correct as they'll
[2:45:15.460 --> 2:45:18.820]  say but they really mean is everything must be in order and they're also
[2:45:18.820 --> 2:45:23.140]  breeding that new row sees into their minions the police and bureaucrats where
[2:45:23.140 --> 2:45:26.420]  oh we you know you're at the baseball game you ordered lemonade for your son
[2:45:26.420 --> 2:45:30.460]  we brought you a hard lemonade but it looks like a lemonade bottle he takes a
[2:45:30.460 --> 2:45:34.420]  drink we instantly take your kid your life's over and we say we know you did
[2:45:34.420 --> 2:45:39.340]  it on accident the order must be followed and and so it's just and just in
[2:45:39.340 --> 2:45:43.060]  like oh you didn't instantly comply with me I'm gonna put you in a coma now I'm
[2:45:43.060 --> 2:45:47.220]  gonna beat your head in yes I mean it really is getting to that stage
[2:45:47.220 --> 2:45:51.780]  where you're stopped for just about anything I was stopped in town a few
[2:45:51.780 --> 2:45:55.620]  weeks ago I was tailed through town actually and then stopped eventually on
[2:45:55.620 --> 2:46:00.100]  a pretext of course but I'd flicked a cigarette butt out the window and I
[2:46:00.100 --> 2:46:04.100]  happen to smoke and I I said is it this one here I had a cigarette in my hand
[2:46:04.100 --> 2:46:08.500]  I said well it could not be that it must be in the ash you said oh you can get a
[2:46:08.500 --> 2:46:12.580]  hundred dollar fine for that he said and then of course he proceeded to go
[2:46:12.580 --> 2:46:16.060]  through all the papers and all the rest of it but I get tilled around I'm sure
[2:46:16.060 --> 2:46:23.140]  you do too don't these guys know that that that this isn't freedom I mean don't
[2:46:23.140 --> 2:46:28.340]  they understand that this is bad hmm but when you have people who've been
[2:46:28.340 --> 2:46:35.580]  transitioned from a peacekeeping and and to law enforcement and I mean brought up
[2:46:35.580 --> 2:46:43.300]  with 20 25 years of cop shows and and TV dramas and SWAT teams and so on and
[2:46:43.300 --> 2:46:47.900]  video games which were meant for the military you have a militarized mentality
[2:46:47.900 --> 2:46:52.380]  amongst young people who would never get a job in anywhere else especially then
[2:46:52.380 --> 2:46:56.900]  to let their hiring no they can't all they've done is exactly and they think
[2:46:56.900 --> 2:47:00.660]  it's manly to just crack heads and beat people up and they've simulated murder
[2:47:00.660 --> 2:47:04.500]  millions of times on the video games and now they're gonna do it for real did you
[2:47:04.500 --> 2:47:08.020]  hear about taser international they went into a county where three people died
[2:47:08.020 --> 2:47:12.300]  after being tasered and they they're suing the doctors and coroner saying
[2:47:12.300 --> 2:47:16.340]  you're not allowed now and the judge is telling them you're not allowed to ever
[2:47:16.340 --> 2:47:21.900]  say tasers could hurt someone they're telling doctors now now what what their
[2:47:21.900 --> 2:47:28.100]  medical rulings can be I mean I mean look at the control of that yes but what
[2:47:28.100 --> 2:47:32.820]  you but we are in this kind of totalitarian system right now this
[2:47:32.820 --> 2:47:38.500]  happened in Nazi Germany when the order went out for racial hygiene and they
[2:47:38.500 --> 2:47:41.700]  were in the hospitals and there's lots of documentaries you can still pull out
[2:47:41.700 --> 2:47:46.340]  where they taught it in school and try to convince the children in the 30s the
[2:47:46.340 --> 2:47:50.460]  ones who were growing up and who would be the guards etc. they were showing
[2:47:50.460 --> 2:47:55.140]  these videos on mental deficiency and they reworded it and retitled it and so
[2:47:55.140 --> 2:47:59.700]  on so that there wasn't really a human being anymore so through the change of
[2:47:59.700 --> 2:48:04.940]  words and law you couldn't see what murder was murdered you couldn't see
[2:48:04.940 --> 2:48:09.780]  genocide was genocide it was ruled illegal to do so so it's the same thing
[2:48:09.780 --> 2:48:13.980]  that's happening now they're telling the doctors put down anything on that
[2:48:13.980 --> 2:48:18.420]  certificate cardiac arrest whatever but I mean they're the exactly they're the
[2:48:18.420 --> 2:48:22.700]  doctor you know it's their profession they are supposed to make the ruling and
[2:48:22.700 --> 2:48:27.300]  then they say oh they didn't die because you tasered them I'm the judge and then
[2:48:27.300 --> 2:48:31.380]  now taser says they're going to sue any doctor or any medical examiner that says
[2:48:31.380 --> 2:48:35.860]  cause of death was taser preemptively threatening them and you know to their
[2:48:35.860 --> 2:48:39.860]  credit the different associations are freaking out saying you know you can't
[2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:44.940]  you can't do that I mean here it is right here judge rules for taser in case
[2:48:44.940 --> 2:48:50.740]  of death decisions Arizona Republic chief medical examiner Lisa Kohler said
[2:48:50.740 --> 2:48:54.940]  the examiners rightly concluded taser contributing to the deaths and said
[2:48:54.940 --> 2:48:59.380]  county lawyers will appeal the judge's ruling and it and it goes on to say it
[2:48:59.380 --> 2:49:04.860]  is dangerous dangerously close to intimidation says Jeff Jetson president
[2:49:04.860 --> 2:49:09.100]  of the National Association of medical examiners at this point we adamantly
[2:49:09.100 --> 2:49:12.660]  reject the fact that people can be sued for medical opinions that they make I
[2:49:12.660 --> 2:49:17.060]  mean this is pure intimidation I mean everybody knows the tasers are killing
[2:49:17.060 --> 2:49:22.660]  everybody but they say no we'll sue you if you say that because they admit that
[2:49:22.660 --> 2:49:27.420]  they're training cops to shoot us with real guns this is about torture go ahead
[2:49:27.420 --> 2:49:32.140]  well that's true it is torture and I think it's probably another reason for it
[2:49:32.140 --> 2:49:35.500]  to that they're even pushing up the stories and allowing us to hear them
[2:49:35.500 --> 2:49:40.540]  because they're going to bring in even more futuristic weapons which can can
[2:49:40.540 --> 2:49:45.340]  do the same kind of damage even even worse damage without the use of wires
[2:49:45.340 --> 2:49:50.540]  and without being within a certain range either well you're in Canada where
[2:49:50.540 --> 2:49:53.780]  they admittedly it came out in the news that if they if you don't have your
[2:49:53.780 --> 2:49:57.740]  ticket on you they taser you for punishment and the paper said
[2:49:57.740 --> 2:50:00.700]  that and people didn't believe it and then the police she came out and said
[2:50:00.700 --> 2:50:05.780]  yes it's your punishment I mean now judge jury you're gonna be tortured with
[2:50:05.780 --> 2:50:10.100]  something that has a good chance of killing you I mean that is just off the
[2:50:10.100 --> 2:50:14.140]  chart and they're being told it's to keep doing it yeah that make a major
[2:50:14.140 --> 2:50:21.180]  shift between using techniques of restraint etc and to techniques of
[2:50:21.180 --> 2:50:27.660]  coercion they're using it as a tool to make someone comply a compliance tool
[2:50:27.660 --> 2:50:31.380]  rather than something there's only to be used in the emergency so they're
[2:50:31.380 --> 2:50:37.660]  gradually changing the meaning of words they say and into law to allow
[2:50:37.660 --> 2:50:42.540]  themselves to use this kind of weaponry Alan wants stay there we'll be right
[2:50:42.540 --> 2:50:53.260]  back after this quick break it is a big idea a new world order in the near

[2:54:23.100 --> 2:54:28.900]  Ellen one I want to get your take on this they've got thousands of
[2:54:28.900 --> 2:54:33.380]  laboratories with gene guns firing genetics into different species it's
[2:54:33.380 --> 2:54:37.500]  admittedly already given rise to super viruses super bacteria they've got
[2:54:37.500 --> 2:54:43.260]  giant superconducting super colliders cyclotrons hundreds of top physicists and
[2:54:43.260 --> 2:54:47.580]  quantum mechanics experts engineers are saying it could blow the planet up
[2:54:47.580 --> 2:54:51.780]  create a strange lid I mean this is the same equations that you know created a
[2:54:51.780 --> 2:54:57.020]  bombs and hydrogen bombs 60 years before they had them 50 years before they
[2:54:57.020 --> 2:55:00.780]  had them we know that people like h.g. Wells are writing about it so the the
[2:55:00.780 --> 2:55:04.100]  elite also are very reckless I mean they're not gods they're not invincible
[2:55:04.100 --> 2:55:08.060]  and I really think that they're out of control I mean they've got control of
[2:55:08.060 --> 2:55:13.180]  us but I think they're getting very nihilistic very psychopathic and a lot
[2:55:13.180 --> 2:55:17.100]  of their own writings admit that they're getting very very decadent and very very
[2:55:17.100 --> 2:55:20.820]  evil and you know the new thrill to them is playing with things that could
[2:55:20.820 --> 2:55:25.380]  destroy themselves can you comment on that yeah they go through cycles of this
[2:55:25.380 --> 2:55:29.900]  down through history you'll find this happening every 50 years or so they
[2:55:29.900 --> 2:55:35.500]  they've got to have some big bloodletting almost the the rise to an
[2:55:35.500 --> 2:55:41.420]  incredible degree of even more wealth of more power and then they become rather
[2:55:41.420 --> 2:55:44.620]  careless in the way they handle themselves and what they say to the
[2:55:44.620 --> 2:55:49.180]  public it's only after wars they retreats and they're careful what they
[2:55:49.180 --> 2:55:53.340]  say they play politics then but when they really believe they're on the verge of
[2:55:53.340 --> 2:55:57.380]  conquering something with a new era they come out into the open and start to
[2:55:57.380 --> 2:56:01.420]  boast that's also a trait of the psychopath because they have tremendous
[2:56:01.420 --> 2:56:06.340]  egos they cannot keep their mouths shut well psychopaths I mean just a run of
[2:56:06.340 --> 2:56:09.820]  the mill kidnapping people and killing them at first they'll kill one person a
[2:56:09.820 --> 2:56:13.420]  year then one person every six months and one person a month and one person
[2:56:13.420 --> 2:56:17.220]  every day and by the end of it they're drunk driving with two dead bodies in
[2:56:17.220 --> 2:56:22.940]  the car looking for trouble age I mean and notice it's always a local police
[2:56:22.940 --> 2:56:29.380]  commissioner or I mean it's just craziness yes and also a psychopath once
[2:56:29.380 --> 2:56:35.340]  they're caught regardless of their mass murderers or serial killers they'll then
[2:56:35.340 --> 2:56:39.580]  love to tell you the world how they did it because they truly believe they're so
[2:56:39.580 --> 2:56:44.100]  clever and they think they'll impress the world by revealing how clever they've
[2:56:44.100 --> 2:56:47.180]  been in with their techniques well here's another example since you raised
[2:56:47.180 --> 2:56:52.460]  that super class the global power elite in the world they are making David
[2:56:52.460 --> 2:56:57.620]  Rothkoff and he's he just says here in the book that they're gonna take the
[2:56:57.620 --> 2:57:01.060]  internet away how they're gonna enslave us how they're increasing the police how
[2:57:01.060 --> 2:57:03.820]  they're gonna take our freedoms how we're gonna have a world government
[2:57:03.820 --> 2:57:07.460]  whether we like it or not I mean they are and he's the head of Kissinger and
[2:57:07.460 --> 2:57:11.980]  associates mm-hmm yeah that's right yeah they're becoming very open now they
[2:57:11.980 --> 2:57:17.100]  truly believe they're the almost in fact some of them do believe that they've
[2:57:17.100 --> 2:57:21.500]  taken over the world already it's a matter of just getting the few remaining
[2:57:21.500 --> 2:57:26.300]  public who can still think to accept it and that's only problem that they have
[2:57:26.300 --> 2:57:30.620]  that they do studies all the time on the general population to keep the pulse of
[2:57:30.620 --> 2:57:36.580]  the population all the time and they know how Joe average is going to accept
[2:57:36.580 --> 2:57:41.140]  whatever and it's true what Aristotle said that revolutions never happen from
[2:57:41.140 --> 2:57:44.980]  that from the base people at the bottom they need leadership that comes from a
[2:57:44.980 --> 2:57:49.060]  middle class and they're so constant of wiped out pretty well most of the
[2:57:49.060 --> 2:57:54.820]  major middle class the rest they do keep tabs on under children's I say the
[2:57:54.820 --> 2:57:58.500]  dumb dumb dumb with Ritalin and so on and that they're pretty sure they can pull
[2:57:58.500 --> 2:58:02.100]  all of this off without any problems from the general public who will simply
[2:58:02.100 --> 2:58:07.700]  go along with anything at all and it's a cold-blooded it's a cold-blooded way
[2:58:07.700 --> 2:58:13.420]  of extincting any resistance in the future to just completely destroy the
[2:58:13.420 --> 2:58:17.740]  middle class and then dumb down the few that are left and then go ahead and in
[2:58:17.740 --> 2:58:21.900]  orderly fashion exterminate the majority of us and a lot of you yuppies think
[2:58:21.900 --> 2:58:24.780]  you're part of the elite you're not that's another mechanism they use we'll

[3:00:02.260 --> 3:00:07.780]  you know I am somebody who doesn't claim to be the nicest person or the best
[3:00:07.780 --> 3:00:13.420]  person in the world I just have instincts human instincts normal instincts
[3:00:13.420 --> 3:00:20.540]  I like to see people do well I feel good for a neighbor when they've got a fancy
[3:00:20.540 --> 3:00:27.620]  car or a good-looking wife I admire beautiful women I admire handsome men I
[3:00:27.620 --> 3:00:32.900]  admire people that have beautiful horses or people who paint beautiful
[3:00:32.900 --> 3:00:36.780]  paintings and I growing up thought that that was normal I thought everybody
[3:00:36.780 --> 3:00:42.740]  else was like that and so when kids would be mean to me or people would beat
[3:00:42.740 --> 3:00:47.940]  me up when I was a little kid for no reason or when I found out that the cops
[3:00:47.940 --> 3:00:50.940]  dealt the drugs where I grew up and then and then would still put kids in jail
[3:00:50.940 --> 3:00:55.180]  for using drugs that their associates sold them it would really freak me out
[3:00:55.180 --> 3:00:58.980]  and then I found out there were evil people in the world but but I still
[3:00:58.980 --> 3:01:02.660]  thought that everybody else thought like I did and now I've learned growing up
[3:01:02.660 --> 3:01:09.140]  the elite have given us their view it's totally envy driven it's totally it's
[3:01:09.140 --> 3:01:13.660]  totally about cutting everybody else down it's totally about being hyper
[3:01:13.660 --> 3:01:19.260]  competitive but we all fight with each other while the elite basically rule
[3:01:19.260 --> 3:01:25.500]  over us now I've gone from the extreme of not wanting to compete with people and
[3:01:25.500 --> 3:01:29.580]  always turn to the other cheek tour now I realize so much of the public scum to
[3:01:29.580 --> 3:01:33.820]  protect myself I have to want somebody makes a move on me I've got to go ahead
[3:01:33.820 --> 3:01:36.980]  and beat them and dominate them and try to knock them out if they keep going
[3:01:36.980 --> 3:01:41.980]  after me just to protect myself but that's done out of defense and so I can
[3:01:41.980 --> 3:01:45.220]  see the psychology of the elite they say look we have to go ahead and done
[3:01:45.220 --> 3:01:49.580]  everybody down there a bunch of scum backstabbing rabble but it's more than
[3:01:49.580 --> 3:01:55.380]  that they actually accentuate all of that and use our weaknesses to bring down
[3:01:55.380 --> 3:01:59.700]  society so they can manage us and control us and then finally get rid of us
[3:01:59.700 --> 3:02:03.580]  Alan want your comments on that statement yeah well what you find and
[3:02:03.580 --> 3:02:09.180]  studies done on this we're very good studies even amongst the old Communist
[3:02:09.180 --> 3:02:12.940]  Block they found their leaders had much the same traits as the leaders of the
[3:02:12.940 --> 3:02:17.380]  West being psychopaths in other words as the conclusions they came to but they
[3:02:17.380 --> 3:02:21.180]  also went through history and found out that psychopaths always tend to get to
[3:02:21.180 --> 3:02:27.340]  the top in a monetary system based on commerce because you can get your tails
[3:02:27.340 --> 3:02:33.540]  together you can monopolize whole areas of commerce and once you do that you
[3:02:33.540 --> 3:02:37.620]  can hold or even create a society that's now held at ransom because you
[3:02:37.620 --> 3:02:42.500]  dominate the essentials for what they need that's what's happened today they
[3:02:42.500 --> 3:02:46.100]  went after all the resources of the world they've gone after the food they have
[3:02:46.100 --> 3:02:49.740]  five agribusinesses taken over for the food and that now they're after the
[3:02:49.740 --> 3:02:54.180]  water supply to get the whole world at their mercy however psychopaths also
[3:02:54.180 --> 3:02:59.740]  give you a culture which we will adopt and it's based on competition at the
[3:02:59.740 --> 3:03:05.700]  bottom so we compete and compete with each other like some ancient games that
[3:03:05.700 --> 3:03:10.620]  they held in Greece and of course those who get up there showing psychopathic
[3:03:10.620 --> 3:03:16.020]  qualities and basically eliminating all competition on their way up regardless
[3:03:16.020 --> 3:03:20.580]  of how they did it they are accepted into the higher circles they've proven
[3:03:20.580 --> 3:03:25.860]  their worth is to say and so we are trying to emulate the psychopath let me
[3:03:25.860 --> 3:03:28.660]  stop you and just say that I've been around a lot of elitists and I would
[3:03:28.660 --> 3:03:32.700]  imagine you may have Alan and they actually openly say we respect you that
[3:03:32.700 --> 3:03:36.980]  fighters we respect but listen one day you're gonna want to join us because the
[3:03:36.980 --> 3:03:40.980]  scum is so dumb out there they don't even want your help I mean I've had the
[3:03:40.980 --> 3:03:45.940]  elite time and time again openly say that to me yes oh yes and I've had the
[3:03:45.940 --> 3:03:50.860]  offers to to join some of the associations even with the United Nations
[3:03:50.860 --> 3:03:55.060]  and other big organizations and I've turned them down but that's exactly
[3:03:55.060 --> 3:03:59.860]  what to say if you don't fit in there you don't belong with those people those
[3:03:59.860 --> 3:04:04.140]  people will tear you to shreds because they don't want to hear the bad news
[3:04:04.140 --> 3:04:09.620]  and unfortunately to an extent they are right however yeah but they I mean
[3:04:09.620 --> 3:04:13.660]  listen they're running child kidnapping rings as you know you know the point is
[3:04:13.660 --> 3:04:17.500]  they've got all their arguments but when it gets to the final equation if we just
[3:04:17.500 --> 3:04:22.500]  say go ahead be evil where does it end well it doesn't end I mean it's an
[3:04:22.500 --> 3:04:25.620]  acquiesce it stay there Alan I want to talk to you during the break for people
[3:04:25.620 --> 3:04:28.540]  listening to the info wars dot com streams you go over there we're gonna

[3:05:48.780 --> 3:05:53.020]  America is one of the two most talked about nations in the Bible it's only
[3:05:53.020 --> 3:05:57.580]  because we don't know our roots our origins before we settle North America
[3:05:57.580 --> 3:06:03.420]  that ministers and their flocks cannot identify America in Bible prophecy that
[3:06:03.420 --> 3:06:07.980]  knowledge is essential if we are to understand who Jesus is and why he came
[3:06:07.980 --> 3:06:13.300]  into human form he came to confirm the promises made to the fathers of Israel

[3:08:19.060 --> 3:08:24.060]  graciously 20 minutes into the next hour Alan before we go any further give
[3:08:24.060 --> 3:08:29.340]  out your website the great audiobooks the videos the work you've done is I was
[3:08:29.340 --> 3:08:32.660]  asked on National British Radio a few months ago who I thought one of the best
[3:08:32.660 --> 3:08:36.380]  leading minds in this fight was who doesn't put out bull but actually covers
[3:08:36.380 --> 3:08:40.580]  what's you know what he can prove and I and I plugged Alan Watt and I mean that
[3:08:40.580 --> 3:08:44.740]  you're a real treasure you know when I mean in full wide spectrum analysis of
[3:08:44.740 --> 3:08:49.940]  enemy operations tell us about some of the things some of the books and videos
[3:08:49.940 --> 3:08:53.660]  you have a lot most of us for free but people should also buy some of the
[3:08:53.660 --> 3:08:59.820]  things you produced because you deserve support yeah it's cutting through the
[3:08:59.820 --> 3:09:05.740]  matrix.com as the website and you can see Alan Watt sent in sentinel.eu as
[3:09:05.740 --> 3:09:10.820]  well for transcripts but I do have some books to to sell that I've written and
[3:09:10.820 --> 3:09:15.780]  CDs as well going through the histories even to ancient times on at these
[3:09:15.780 --> 3:09:19.940]  particular elitist families and how they created religions to control how they
[3:09:19.940 --> 3:09:24.140]  use those religions always towards the same agenda they knew it were going a
[3:09:24.140 --> 3:09:29.800]  long time ago and I put it together from as best I can through talks and the
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:35.320]  also DVDs they can buy where I give special talks on the so-called occultic
[3:09:35.320 --> 3:09:40.420]  side or hidden side of this as well to do with the belief themselves that they
[3:09:40.420 --> 3:09:44.380]  need to hold and they do have their own little belief structure there their own
[3:09:44.380 --> 3:09:48.940]  inner religion there's no doubt about that. When we go into overdrive in the
[3:09:48.940 --> 3:09:54.740]  next hour let's spend some time on that after calls right now I want to get more
[3:09:54.740 --> 3:10:00.340]  into the genetic engineering not just what they're doing to to to have no
[3:10:00.340 --> 3:10:04.220]  doubt all the cures going back over 30 years that they have for every type of
[3:10:04.220 --> 3:10:08.980]  cancer you can imagine while at the same time in planting us with the cancers I
[3:10:08.980 --> 3:10:12.740]  mean it's admitted I had guessed on last week about it hundreds of different
[3:10:12.740 --> 3:10:18.060]  cancer viruses one in 33 having cancer 50 years ago now one in three I mean it's
[3:10:18.060 --> 3:10:24.140]  like getting a cold now as this gets more and more horrific I see as a real
[3:10:24.140 --> 3:10:27.220]  chink in their armor if you can explain to the cops and have them go see the
[3:10:27.220 --> 3:10:30.860]  documents that their mother or their son or their daughter or they are going to
[3:10:30.860 --> 3:10:35.220]  die or have already died from what their masters gave them maybe that'll have
[3:10:35.220 --> 3:10:40.420]  them maybe that'll make them wake up. Yes true the younger you are the more
[3:10:40.420 --> 3:10:44.060]  difficult is to believe they'll ever die that's part of the problem the ones you
[3:10:44.060 --> 3:10:47.140]  have to target are the ones who are married a bit older they've thought
[3:10:47.140 --> 3:10:51.140]  about life and death itself and including their own one day and that's when
[3:10:51.140 --> 3:10:56.100]  you start to think and realize that you are more than just a human being I
[3:10:56.100 --> 3:11:00.260]  think every human being is to an extent sacred and that they start to think
[3:11:00.260 --> 3:11:04.580]  about the first and last causes of life but they're very young of course that's
[3:11:04.580 --> 3:11:09.380]  why they recruit the young for the military no no no young personally
[3:11:09.380 --> 3:11:12.700]  going to the military thinking that he or she was going to be killed they would
[3:11:12.700 --> 3:11:17.700]  never believe it. In fact these big tough guys when their arms and legs are blown off
[3:11:17.700 --> 3:11:21.420]  you know they cry for mommy and they and they cry and can't believe they're
[3:11:21.420 --> 3:11:26.020]  dying they're so afraid. Yeah it's an impossibility and that's why they've
[3:11:26.020 --> 3:11:30.540]  always used young children they tried this out in World War I when they were
[3:11:30.540 --> 3:11:34.740]  trying to really reduce the population and bring in the League of Nations as a
[3:11:34.740 --> 3:11:38.860]  world government that was the purpose of World War I well written about by those
[3:11:38.860 --> 3:11:44.860]  behind the scenes after the war and they were putting in men in their forties
[3:11:44.860 --> 3:11:49.140]  eventually they're running out of young young people after sending wave after
[3:11:49.140 --> 3:11:54.300]  wave into machine gun fire. A average regiment would last 50 minutes in the
[3:11:54.300 --> 3:11:58.740]  field and they found... And it turned out they knew that areas weren't even you know
[3:11:58.740 --> 3:12:02.580]  being defended or areas didn't even need to be taken the French and Germans
[3:12:02.580 --> 3:12:06.700]  would just send wave after wave after wave and they found that a 30 40 year old
[3:12:06.700 --> 3:12:10.500]  wasn't they were cowards they would at least try to avoid the machine gun fire
[3:12:10.500 --> 3:12:15.620]  whereas the 12-year-old child wouldn't. Yes and they also came to an understanding
[3:12:15.620 --> 3:12:19.140]  on both sides of the trenches because even the Germans were putting young
[3:12:19.140 --> 3:12:23.700]  older guys in too and and they were too mature they realized it was all a far
[3:12:23.700 --> 3:12:27.580]  to begin with. They'd fire a few shots over the lines over the heads of the
[3:12:27.580 --> 3:12:31.260]  enemy every day just to keep their officers happy. And then you had
[3:12:31.260 --> 3:12:34.740]  psychological tests that came out and then publicly they started having the
[3:12:34.740 --> 3:12:39.140]  paper targets in the 30s and 40s pop up to habitualize you to shoot the image of
[3:12:39.140 --> 3:12:43.260]  a person then they pioneered the video games and they've gone from 90% not
[3:12:43.260 --> 3:12:48.820]  killing somebody up close to now 95% will kill somebody up close and now
[3:12:48.820 --> 3:12:53.220]  they're your cops and now they'll kill you. Go ahead. And they've had 20 years of
[3:12:53.220 --> 3:12:57.620]  playing on video games where the only object is to kill as many of the enemy as
[3:12:57.620 --> 3:13:02.180]  possible. Murder simulators. Murder simulators. Absolutely. This was all
[3:13:02.180 --> 3:13:05.740]  planned this way. All planned this way. They admit it's all planned that way. I mean
[3:13:05.740 --> 3:13:11.020]  that's the thing. This is so diabolical. Yeah they needed a generation that would
[3:13:11.020 --> 3:13:16.700]  do this. A generation from the 60s they would not do it but so they created a
[3:13:16.700 --> 3:13:20.980]  generation who would do it. The purpose made the design the generation to do
[3:13:20.980 --> 3:13:30.180]  exactly this today. Getting into genetic engineering. What's your info on why
[3:13:30.180 --> 3:13:34.540]  they're so madly doing pure research that's so dangerous and why they're
[3:13:34.540 --> 3:13:38.420]  putting GMO food on all the store shelves that they know is killing people
[3:13:38.420 --> 3:13:43.020]  in mass. Killing all of the lab animals that are fed it. I mean is that just part
[3:13:43.020 --> 3:13:46.460]  of the population control? I mean is that part of the power trip? Because we
[3:13:46.460 --> 3:13:50.340]  know that all the elitists are obsessed on their own farms, filter their water.
[3:13:50.340 --> 3:13:54.140]  I mean I guess that's just another little friendly thing they do. It's
[3:13:54.140 --> 3:13:59.660]  definitely to do with making us secured to die earlier and to die faster. The
[3:13:59.660 --> 3:14:03.660]  death rate now as you see is skyrocketing with all these illnesses and
[3:14:03.660 --> 3:14:08.740]  diseases. It wasn't enough to have all the viruses in the various vaccines
[3:14:08.740 --> 3:14:12.580]  we were given. So they're simply speeding up the process and they're
[3:14:12.580 --> 3:14:15.940]  teaching, it's what's interesting, they're teaching doctors who are just
[3:14:15.940 --> 3:14:20.940]  coming out of medical school that one and two dying of cancer is now normal.
[3:14:20.940 --> 3:14:26.460]  They have not given any history even 40 years ago of particular cancers and how
[3:14:26.460 --> 3:14:32.820]  rare meant most of these cancers were. So they've trained them too to think it's
[3:14:32.820 --> 3:14:37.140]  all natural and that's the beauty of intakes in university. You can train every
[3:14:37.140 --> 3:14:42.020]  generation a completely different bunch of theories and fake history if you
[3:14:42.020 --> 3:14:46.100]  want and they won't question it. They think it's all true. There's no reason to
[3:14:46.100 --> 3:14:51.220]  question it really and so they accept it as well. And they love their cancer.
[3:14:51.220 --> 3:14:55.420]  They love their government. The government couldn't be giving me
[3:14:55.420 --> 3:14:59.140]  cancer. I'm a member of the government. I'm an officer. They love me. I'm a good
[3:14:59.140 --> 3:15:02.980]  doctor. I help people. I follow the AMA guidelines and of course the doctor's
[3:15:02.980 --> 3:15:06.300]  not involved in that. They don't know the Rockefellers in the 20s, spend hundreds
[3:15:06.300 --> 3:15:10.180]  of millions of dollars studying where cancer came from. I mean I remember
[3:15:10.180 --> 3:15:14.580]  getting on the air 12 years ago and saying most cancer is viral and having
[3:15:14.580 --> 3:15:20.540]  top scientists on and people wouldn't believe me. Now they're teaching you,
[3:15:20.540 --> 3:15:25.980]  yo, most cancer is viral but we have vaccines that will protect you and then
[3:15:25.980 --> 3:15:30.540]  you find out that actually the cancer vaccine massively increases getting
[3:15:30.540 --> 3:15:35.700]  cancer. It says on the insert but they'll never read that. Yes and also if
[3:15:35.700 --> 3:15:40.900]  you're going to CBC that's the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation archive.
[3:15:40.900 --> 3:15:49.220]  That's org.org.ca. Look at the special report that was done on Dr. Salk. It's
[3:15:49.220 --> 3:15:55.060]  old footage they showed on television a few years ago and in the footage Dr.
[3:15:55.060 --> 3:16:00.420]  Salk says, oh yeah, we knew that the Simeon 40 virus and many other cancer
[3:16:00.420 --> 3:16:05.340]  causing viruses were in each shot of polio but we outweighed the risks and
[3:16:05.340 --> 3:16:09.660]  went ahead anyway. He said it was worth it. Then he talked to his other technicians
[3:16:09.660 --> 3:16:14.740]  who also knew that they were basically condemning a whole generation to
[3:16:14.740 --> 3:16:20.340]  rapidly growing cancers. And by the way he's the inventor of the polio vaccine
[3:16:20.340 --> 3:16:23.260]  which we know was a government bio weapon itself. That's now been admitted.
[3:16:23.260 --> 3:16:27.620]  He was also the top eugenicist for this the whole American and British
[3:16:27.620 --> 3:16:31.780]  Association. He was the man who was writing books before the polio vaccine
[3:16:31.780 --> 3:16:36.660]  on the necessity to bring down the population by any means possible and he
[3:16:36.660 --> 3:16:39.660]  comes out as the savior. Well that's what I was going to say is it's funny you
[3:16:39.660 --> 3:16:44.500]  mentioned that. We actually played that clip from the CBC last week on the show
[3:16:44.500 --> 3:16:49.780]  and he's laughing. He's going hundreds of viruses and he goes you know what we did?
[3:16:49.780 --> 3:16:54.460]  We took the monkeys from the bio weapons labs and then we grew the vaccine from
[3:16:54.460 --> 3:16:58.980]  them and he starts laughing and the people with him go and they all start
[3:16:58.980 --> 3:17:03.900]  laughing. Oh it's because hey having a big house is in power. Having a fancy car
[3:17:03.900 --> 3:17:09.540]  is in power. Killing all those people. You know I'll never forget a PBS
[3:17:09.540 --> 3:17:14.220]  documentary probably it'll be 14 years ago. I wasn't even on area and I'm
[3:17:14.220 --> 3:17:18.660]  visiting over my parents house. This is longer than that. I was in college.
[3:17:18.660 --> 3:17:25.340]  That had to be 15 years ago and I'm over at their house. PBS is on and it's a show
[3:17:25.340 --> 3:17:29.820]  about Jack of Orchie before he went to jail. It was him in New York at a art
[3:17:29.820 --> 3:17:35.420]  showing and I wish somebody'd find this tape and it said Tom Cruise was there and
[3:17:35.420 --> 3:17:38.500]  showed all these supermodels and these beautiful women were walking and going
[3:17:38.500 --> 3:17:43.420]  oh my giggling and like rubbing on his jacket and he was like a rock star and
[3:17:43.420 --> 3:17:46.460]  they were looking at his paintings and he was saying I painted this in my own
[3:17:46.460 --> 3:17:51.140]  blood. This is oil. This is blood and it was demons eating babies as they came
[3:17:51.140 --> 3:17:54.780]  out of women's wombs and it was shocking art. It made me step back. I mean it was
[3:17:54.780 --> 3:18:01.820]  it was very powerful art and they were all going jump it. Is it so much? I mean
[3:18:01.820 --> 3:18:05.900]  it's just fun. It's fun that they did this to my grandmother who's on crutches
[3:18:05.900 --> 3:18:09.940]  at 84 years old that it ate most of her nerves and that she almost died and was
[3:18:09.940 --> 3:18:14.020]  in there with an iron lung. It's fun isn't it? Isn't it fun Alan?
[3:18:14.020 --> 3:18:23.020]  It's just amazing. It's amazing. And also it's a resurgence of the art that was shown
[3:18:23.020 --> 3:18:29.100]  in the 1930s for it's called the new man and all the western countries including
[3:18:29.100 --> 3:18:32.700]  Germany were part of that and they had they were pushing what they called the
[3:18:32.700 --> 3:18:37.580]  new man at that time the man to come the Superman and it didn't start in

[3:19:02.420 --> 3:19:06.820]  going to bring in the future it would be self replicating a form of
[3:19:06.820 --> 3:19:13.060]  hermaphrodite and all the enough I was reading in the paper just today that some
[3:19:13.060 --> 3:19:17.460]  scientists have just done that that very thing that actually created a

[3:24:40.620 --> 3:24:48.940]  959-9231. Allen brought up how they're brainwashing the young, how they're
[3:24:48.940 --> 3:24:53.540]  training them for law enforcement in school. It starts with betraying your
[3:24:53.540 --> 3:24:58.140]  parents. I have it on video. What's in mommy and daddy's cabinet? Medicine
[3:24:58.140 --> 3:25:02.460]  cabinet. What do the guns look like? Right as... I mean, parents send your
[3:25:02.460 --> 3:25:07.420]  children to a predatory demon government. And the cops think it's normal now to do
[3:25:07.420 --> 3:25:11.420]  that. But the Soviets were bad 20 years ago because they did, right? Charter
[3:25:11.420 --> 3:25:17.020]  School will focus on homeland security, the first high school dedicated to
[3:25:17.020 --> 3:25:20.540]  preparing students for the front lines, the front lines, and the nation's home
[3:25:20.540 --> 3:25:26.780]  land security has gone from theory to planning in Wilmington. The project
[3:25:26.780 --> 3:25:31.700]  manager for the Delaware Academy of Public Safety and Security, Newcastle
[3:25:31.700 --> 3:25:36.140]  Anthony Thomas Little signed a contract with innovative schools, a
[3:25:36.140 --> 3:25:40.100]  professional firm which will coordinate the mechanisms preparing the school for
[3:25:40.100 --> 3:25:44.700]  its eventual opening. Now, before 9-11, they already had Secure Corps, Division
[3:25:44.700 --> 3:25:49.300]  of AmeriCorps, training the kids with M-16s, weapons, everything in public
[3:25:49.300 --> 3:25:53.780]  schools in Philadelphia to, quote, do warrants, service, roundups. That was in
[3:25:53.780 --> 3:25:58.340]  the news. So they always tell the town, you're the first to do this. There's also
[3:25:58.340 --> 3:26:02.340]  that feeling of elitism. I would go to town after town that had Delta Force there,
[3:26:02.340 --> 3:26:05.700]  bribing them and getting them ready for martial law. And I'd go into the SWAT team
[3:26:05.700 --> 3:26:08.460]  commander and say, let me guess, they gave you your card and said you were the
[3:26:08.460 --> 3:26:12.140]  first, right? Well, here's a video of them 10 years ago and that would really
[3:26:12.140 --> 3:26:15.060]  freak them out that I knew everything they told them because they talked to
[3:26:15.060 --> 3:26:19.900]  you like little children. Alan, what? Oh, they do. They do talk to their children.
[3:26:19.900 --> 3:26:25.540]  They're given lectures on what to say to the public. Every division of every
[3:26:25.540 --> 3:26:30.940]  governmental department today has a PR team and their job is to soften everything
[3:26:30.940 --> 3:26:35.580]  in a childlike fashion and decide how much you will be told and what you
[3:26:35.580 --> 3:26:39.260]  will not be told. And that goes for even for your local police. Everyone goes
[3:26:39.260 --> 3:26:44.100]  through PR spokesman today. There are basically lawyers. Yeah. Well, here's an
[3:26:44.100 --> 3:26:47.180]  example. I went down to the SWAT team's office because I'd already been at the
[3:26:47.180 --> 3:26:50.100]  county commissioners and they had one of their guys coming and threatened me. So
[3:26:50.100 --> 3:26:53.620]  I'd set a caloring. I went right to the commander and said, don't do that. I'm
[3:26:53.620 --> 3:26:56.820]  allowed to come in here and speak. I'm not intimidated. And he said, oh, look,
[3:26:56.820 --> 3:27:01.100]  we're all good guys. I'm a Vietnam vet and he had Oklahoma City bombing video on
[3:27:01.100 --> 3:27:04.460]  the shelf behind him. And I said, Delta Force will be here soon for a
[3:27:04.460 --> 3:27:07.820]  martial law takeover drill. They want to co-opt you and give you money. And he
[3:27:07.820 --> 3:27:11.780]  said, no, they're not. That's illegal. And laughed at me. Two years later, he
[3:27:11.780 --> 3:27:14.540]  calls me in his office and says, here's their card. Everything you said is true.
[3:27:14.540 --> 3:27:18.420]  Guess what? They were, they had him bugged or something. He was fired two
[3:27:18.420 --> 3:27:24.020]  weeks later. Yes. Oh, yeah. And that's a standard too. You see, you'll find that
[3:27:24.020 --> 3:27:27.660]  the club of Rome, one of the big think tanks that to the mix up policy for the
[3:27:27.660 --> 3:27:30.940]  future. They're the guys who dreamed up the global warming scam and admitted it
[3:27:30.940 --> 3:27:34.620]  in their own book, the first global revelry. Oh, yeah. They just republished that
[3:27:34.620 --> 3:27:39.900]  though two months ago where Haas says it's all fake, but we use it to quote,
[3:27:39.900 --> 3:27:44.900]  make humans the enemy. Yes, that's correct. And so mankind is the enemy to
[3:27:44.900 --> 3:27:49.020]  the environment. And they said during warfare, people do with their tolls
[3:27:49.020 --> 3:27:53.540]  they're more cohesive and we can get our agenda through them. We work together
[3:27:53.540 --> 3:27:58.900]  in a wartime situation so that they get a global type war going. So they use
[3:27:58.900 --> 3:28:04.380]  these techniques for sure. And it never really fails the way it's put over. They
[3:28:04.380 --> 3:28:09.220]  use Madison Avenue. They use the big marketing companies to market ideas
[3:28:09.220 --> 3:28:14.780]  via the news, via news clips and so on. They even pay newspapers to write
[3:28:14.780 --> 3:28:20.540]  pro-active as they call them talks or PC. Oh, yeah. They take our money. They take
[3:28:20.540 --> 3:28:25.380]  hundreds of billions a year and put it into fake news. Oh, yes. They soften
[3:28:25.380 --> 3:28:29.060]  everything and they must sell it to the public. They've just been told in fact
[3:28:29.060 --> 3:28:34.180]  from Bush to start writing positive success stories on NAFTA and
[3:28:34.180 --> 3:28:39.700]  integration of the Americas. So find the good few stories. There is a problem
[3:28:39.700 --> 3:28:44.020]  though. There is a problem though. And that's that the public isn't
[3:28:44.020 --> 3:28:47.460]  sophisticated and doesn't know how they're being lied to, but they all know
[3:28:47.460 --> 3:28:50.820]  the government's criminal. They all know it's dangerous. Everybody has this
[3:28:50.820 --> 3:28:55.260]  feeling of danger. The psychological warfare experts know that we have a six
[3:28:55.260 --> 3:28:58.740]  cents and so an instinctive survival mechanism. Everybody knows we're in
[3:28:58.740 --> 3:29:02.980]  danger. So they try to put in front of that and say, you feel upset because of
[3:29:02.980 --> 3:29:07.100]  al-Qaeda and people feel the fear and they go, yeah, there's something real.
[3:29:07.100 --> 3:29:10.060]  But they don't understand is their fear is of the globalist. You understand what
[3:29:10.060 --> 3:29:13.380]  I'm saying, Alan? Yeah, it's called transference, the two transference. Stay
[3:29:13.380 --> 3:29:16.340]  there. I want to know about transference during the break. And then I promise your

[3:29:48.420 --> 3:29:52.380]  victims of identity theft each year. The crime of identity theft occurs every
[3:29:52.380 --> 3:29:57.500]  3.5 seconds costing the victims an average of $8,000. If you own a PC,

[3:30:47.820 --> 3:30:52.180]  high price of gasoline. It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though
[3:30:52.180 --> 3:30:55.940]  we're paying record prices at the pump. I have run across a company called SFR
[3:30:55.940 --> 3:31:00.060]  who has developed two products that improve gas mileage. Instead of paying a
[3:31:00.060 --> 3:31:04.140]  mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete
[3:31:04.140 --> 3:31:09.060]  fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving
[3:31:09.060 --> 3:31:12.540]  mileage and only one tank full. Protect an engine treatment not only reduces
[3:31:12.540 --> 3:31:16.660]  friction, but it extends the life of your engine. Let's face it, with the high
[3:31:16.660 --> 3:31:20.540]  price of gasoline, it's time to take action. Purchase a protective fuel system
[3:31:20.540 --> 3:31:25.740]  treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95
[3:31:25.740 --> 3:31:31.420]  value free. Call triple eight, use SFR1. That number again is triple eight, use

[3:33:34.500 --> 3:33:42.060]  every one of us the DNA implantations that will give us cancer. It's very
[3:33:42.060 --> 3:33:49.980]  painful to know that they've robbed me of my innocence and I'm here to rob you
[3:33:49.980 --> 3:33:58.060]  of yours because if you continue to be in denial, they're gonna be able to have
[3:33:58.060 --> 3:34:05.340]  their way with you. So I'm sorry that childhood is now ending, but I need you
[3:34:05.340 --> 3:34:10.140]  to consciously break your conditioning now. I need you to consciously realize
[3:34:10.140 --> 3:34:18.020]  that very serious people have you in their crosshairs. I'm tired of all the
[3:34:18.020 --> 3:34:23.740]  autistic children having their lives ruined. I'm tired of watching the
[3:34:23.740 --> 3:34:27.860]  globalists have their way with us. I want to change it. That's why I'm risking my
[3:34:27.860 --> 3:34:33.460]  life. Just sitting about having my name being known. It's not about being a big
[3:34:33.460 --> 3:34:40.900]  shot. It's not about being a filmmaker. It's about survival. It's about me
[3:34:40.900 --> 3:34:45.020]  being a natural human being that resists tyranny and an attack on my
[3:34:45.020 --> 3:34:50.060]  species and an attack to alter my species and to experiment on my species by a
[3:34:50.060 --> 3:34:55.180]  malfunctioning subgroup who are like a cancer. They are a cancer. They think
[3:34:55.180 --> 3:34:57.780]  they're dominant. They're controlling because they're willing to take over,
[3:34:57.780 --> 3:35:02.580]  dominate societies, feed on societies. They think it's their right to rule us.
[3:35:02.580 --> 3:35:07.300]  They think they're the elite because they can race through the body politic. No,
[3:35:07.300 --> 3:35:10.700]  it's because they're malfunctioning. It's because they are psychopathic that
[3:35:10.700 --> 3:35:14.420]  they're able to do this because the rest of us have default switches against
[3:35:14.420 --> 3:35:17.940]  doing what they do because we're part of the species, not this aberrant
[3:35:17.940 --> 3:35:22.980]  malfunction. Alan Watt, I'm going to go back to Will and others. Yes, well it's true.
[3:35:22.980 --> 3:35:28.700]  There's no doubt about it. This is one of the things that Davenport prudent
[3:35:28.700 --> 3:35:33.500]  charge of this particular Cold Spring Harbor investigation said. He said,
[3:35:33.500 --> 3:35:39.740]  until we deal with the eradication of inferior types, he said, he said,
[3:35:39.740 --> 3:35:44.380]  unless we do this, he says they will eventually take over and they will take
[3:35:44.380 --> 3:35:48.140]  control of the world and we shall lose control. That's what he said in his own
[3:35:48.140 --> 3:35:52.740]  writings. And Dr. Watson, the head of the Human Genome, just had to leave for
[3:35:52.740 --> 3:35:57.020]  making similar comments. There's no doubt. They're all part of, never changed,
[3:35:57.020 --> 3:36:01.340]  never ever changed any of their thinking on this whole agenda and the
[3:36:01.340 --> 3:36:05.540]  reasons why they think they must do it. There's not one part of it with the soft
[3:36:05.540 --> 3:36:08.940]  and the tall. I want to go back to the calls. Will, you had another comment. Go
[3:36:08.940 --> 3:36:12.660]  ahead. We're going to go to AJ. Go ahead. Yes, in the recent book that's been
[3:36:12.660 --> 3:36:17.500]  published called Dr. Mary's Monkeys, Dr. Mary Sherman was the cancer research
[3:36:17.500 --> 3:36:26.340]  scientist in the 60s that was working on, apparently working on them. They were
[3:36:26.340 --> 3:36:32.020]  using a particle accelerator somewhere in New Orleans to make this a fast
[3:36:32.020 --> 3:36:37.980]  acting monkey virus cancer formula cocktail that they want to supposedly use
[3:36:37.980 --> 3:36:45.740]  on Castro at that time. And she was mysteriously murdered and found in her
[3:36:45.740 --> 3:36:53.100]  apartment with her arm burnt off. And well, anyway, the book is very
[3:36:53.100 --> 3:36:58.220]  interesting. It gives a lot of theory and a lot of information. They talked
[3:36:58.220 --> 3:37:03.660]  about the monkey viruses that were used in the sock and the saving vaccine. The
[3:37:03.660 --> 3:37:07.820]  author makes it sound like, you know, by accident because of sloppy research. Yeah,
[3:37:07.820 --> 3:37:10.940]  hundreds of millions of Americans accidentally got SV 40, but when you
[3:37:10.940 --> 3:37:14.820]  listen to sock and read the research and I see the studies, like all the time
[3:37:14.820 --> 3:37:18.620]  you'll hear, oh, a vaccine was contaminated and that's because it,
[3:37:18.620 --> 3:37:21.660]  you know, would accidentally go ahead and just kill you or make you have a
[3:37:21.660 --> 3:37:25.940]  convulsion who was too obvious. They recall it. Then you can read the rundown on
[3:37:25.940 --> 3:37:29.220]  what the regulators said was in there and it'll be, you know, just in one
[3:37:29.220 --> 3:37:34.100]  vaccine, 27 different cancer viruses. Then it'll say, I mean, I mean, there are
[3:37:34.100 --> 3:37:38.180]  cancers now that are like purple yogurt that spill out of your nose. There are
[3:37:38.180 --> 3:37:41.660]  cancers that, you know, eat your liver. There are cancers that, I mean, it's
[3:37:41.660 --> 3:37:45.900]  thousands of new ones, cancers that didn't exist are now spreading everywhere.
[3:37:45.900 --> 3:37:49.180]  Yeah. I mean, Alan, what you want to comment on this?
[3:37:49.180 --> 3:37:54.860]  There's no doubt at all about this. As I say, during World War II, they had so
[3:37:54.860 --> 3:37:59.660]  many of these particular viruses perfected. They could grow them in an hour
[3:37:59.660 --> 3:38:05.980]  from scratch and introduce them in various means and they'd also could
[3:38:05.980 --> 3:38:11.020]  target when in your age group that would eventually come out and manifest in you,
[3:38:11.020 --> 3:38:16.740]  depending on your hormonal level, etc. So if they want you to die at 40, as soon as
[3:38:16.740 --> 3:38:21.380]  your hormones start to decline, this would kick in and take over. So that
[3:38:21.380 --> 3:38:24.900]  actually had them time released to an extent according to your physiology.
[3:38:24.940 --> 3:38:28.940]  Yeah. By the way, I've played Clibs of Dr. Salk and all of this and people want
[3:38:28.940 --> 3:38:33.700]  quote evidence. Just Google it, start searching it. But I remember reading six,
[3:38:33.700 --> 3:38:36.700]  seven years ago when I really researched this, I'd always heard it and seen
[3:38:36.700 --> 3:38:41.980]  pieces where the Rockefeller Foundation in the 20s and 30s cornered a cancer
[3:38:41.980 --> 3:38:47.420]  treatment and then literally isolated it was viruses and then had them spread,
[3:38:47.420 --> 3:38:51.140]  had them put in the vaccines, had them put in water supplies. I mean, these
[3:38:51.140 --> 3:38:52.420]  are bastards, folks.
[3:38:53.020 --> 3:38:56.860]  It's even worse than that because I've been through the history of the Rothschild
[3:38:56.860 --> 3:39:02.740]  family and the two children at the beginning, the turn of 1900, both had
[3:39:02.740 --> 3:39:08.340]  written small booklets on the ways to spread contagious diseases amongst the
[3:39:08.340 --> 3:39:13.780]  poor. They were fascinated by how diseases were transmitted by parasites
[3:39:13.780 --> 3:39:19.780]  and so on, like lice and all that. And here's two children, 12 years old and
[3:39:19.780 --> 3:39:23.900]  10 years old, writing books on this. And they just happened to be Rothschilds.
[3:39:23.900 --> 3:39:27.300]  Now, what was the fascination until you go into understanding, these are the
[3:39:27.300 --> 3:39:30.700]  economists of the world. They're not just bankers. They project the future,
[3:39:30.940 --> 3:39:32.740]  many generations into the future.
[3:39:32.740 --> 3:39:36.220]  They're the great architects. They are the architects. They design the whole
[3:39:36.220 --> 3:39:41.300]  hell world we live in. Yeah, they look upon the whole human haired. And that's
[3:39:41.300 --> 3:39:45.620]  what they call it, the human haired. And as a farmer looks upon his
[3:39:46.060 --> 3:39:49.820]  That's why I want the police to know you are the biggest joke to them. They
[3:39:49.820 --> 3:39:54.420]  hate you. They don't care about you. The military. Let's go to AJ in Arizona.
[3:39:54.420 --> 3:39:55.740]  Thanks for holding AJ. Go ahead.
[3:39:56.380 --> 3:40:00.460]  Hey, thanks, Alice. Great. Great to speak to you and Alan both, but I just
[3:40:00.460 --> 3:40:05.740]  wanted to weigh in on the mind control. In the early 90s, 1993, I was part of
[3:40:05.740 --> 3:40:11.820]  the Hermes test program for NLP. And the problem with that program was it
[3:40:11.820 --> 3:40:16.740]  backfired on them. And it was all pivotable around the pillar three of
[3:40:16.740 --> 3:40:21.500]  NLP. Anybody who studies and understands NLP knows there's four pillars. And
[3:40:21.500 --> 3:40:27.900]  what what they didn't count on was that we would all at that time, we were
[3:40:27.900 --> 3:40:30.700]  all classified as eagles. In other words, we took our oath to the
[3:40:30.700 --> 3:40:34.060]  Constitution. And that's, we believe, we honestly believe that we were
[3:40:34.060 --> 3:40:39.020]  protecting, you know, the Constitution. And what NLP enabled us to do was
[3:40:39.020 --> 3:40:45.380]  actually create a crossover matching group. And in November of 1994.
[3:40:45.380 --> 3:40:48.100]  Explain explain to listeners what that term means.
[3:40:48.780 --> 3:40:53.140]  Well, the crossover matching was basically we became a mastermind of
[3:40:53.140 --> 3:40:58.820]  truth. And so what they didn't implement in it was all the black ops and
[3:40:58.820 --> 3:41:01.460]  any of the go back to the other term you were using.
[3:41:01.460 --> 3:41:08.420]  Which one, Alex? The NLP? Neuralistic programming. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I
[3:41:08.420 --> 3:41:12.740]  should back up then. Neuralistic programming. Neuralistic programming is
[3:41:12.740 --> 3:41:16.980]  just a, it's a manner of organizing your thoughts and being in control of your
[3:41:16.980 --> 3:41:21.460]  own mind. If you will, Alex, it's the basic form. No, I mean, I understand what
[3:41:21.460 --> 3:41:24.780]  it is. But for the listeners out there, they teach them this in advanced, you
[3:41:24.780 --> 3:41:28.380]  know, Olympic level sports. It's like preparing your mind, you know, setting
[3:41:28.380 --> 3:41:31.860]  different parameters, trying to focus and control and literally give your
[3:41:31.860 --> 3:41:36.700]  brain orders so that you can then carry out the task. And then that gets, but
[3:41:36.700 --> 3:41:40.380]  really that's the first step in to mind control. For those that don't know,
[3:41:40.500 --> 3:41:44.020]  we've had General Stubblebine on who ran this, one of the projects where they
[3:41:44.020 --> 3:41:48.140]  tried to kill goats with their minds at Fort Bragg and mind control. And he
[3:41:48.140 --> 3:41:51.060]  thought it was for good, but Stubblebine, I think was there a little bit
[3:41:51.060 --> 3:41:54.260]  before you were there in 93. Is that the program you're talking about?
[3:41:54.260 --> 3:42:00.980]  Yes. And it all came to a head. And this is key is in November of 1994, when
[3:42:00.980 --> 3:42:07.220]  our operational detachment was sent to Kuwait to bolster Saddam's southern
[3:42:07.220 --> 3:42:13.460]  movement. President Clinton came to give a speech. And they actually grounded
[3:42:13.460 --> 3:42:17.540]  every all American forces and troops. And I believe it was because there was a
[3:42:17.540 --> 3:42:22.660]  potential mutiny at the time, and he was actually booed off stage. And I think
[3:42:22.660 --> 3:42:29.620]  once the generals realized that in the fall of 94 and actually in the spring
[3:42:29.620 --> 3:42:34.340]  of 95, they began a genocide of eagles in the speck ops. And that's why you
[3:42:34.340 --> 3:42:40.220]  see. Well, I mean, we know they killed the top admiral in his office, shot him
[3:42:40.220 --> 3:42:43.580]  in the chest. They killed a bunch of other officers. I know there was a
[3:42:43.580 --> 3:42:49.620]  rebellion in 94, 95, 96. They killed a bunch of people. But also now that's
[3:42:49.620 --> 3:42:53.060]  why they hire the former Latin American death squads. That's why they hire
[3:42:53.100 --> 3:42:56.060]  aggravated felons. I'm sure you know about that now, how they're just
[3:42:56.060 --> 3:42:59.860]  bringing in the foreigners, not as foreign divisions of troops, but
[3:42:59.860 --> 3:43:04.180]  integrating them into the force. That's true. But what they failed to to
[3:43:04.180 --> 3:43:09.140]  realize is that all those eagles were just became emboldened. I mean, you
[3:43:09.140 --> 3:43:13.060]  know, when you talk about a mindset, look at Luke, we are changed. What
[3:43:13.060 --> 3:43:16.900]  doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And we are here. And what I'm trying to
[3:43:16.900 --> 3:43:21.740]  tell you, Alex, is that people can empower themselves with NLP. And if
[3:43:21.740 --> 3:43:24.980]  they would just take a look at those four pillars, once you make it to
[3:43:24.980 --> 3:43:29.820]  pillar four, nothing, nobody can stop you. If you if you don't understand NLP
[3:43:29.820 --> 3:43:34.460]  when you're watching CNN and all the news programs, if you don't actually
[3:43:34.460 --> 3:43:38.500]  plug your ears, you're actually being codect. Whenever they repeat their
[3:43:38.500 --> 3:43:42.820]  question three times to a public official, and he repeats the question three
[3:43:42.820 --> 3:43:46.740]  back three times that third time, if you don't plug your ears, you're
[3:43:46.740 --> 3:43:50.060]  codecking it into your brain. Yeah, let me explain this to people out there
[3:43:50.060 --> 3:43:53.540]  that don't know at the University of Texas, down the street, what I was
[3:43:53.540 --> 3:43:57.060]  allowed to see by a friend of mine that's very high level there. I'll just
[3:43:57.060 --> 3:44:00.660]  say that he wouldn't let me into the monkey control rooms or other things
[3:44:00.660 --> 3:44:04.620]  where it was hooked into cameras across town and out in Bastrop out the
[3:44:04.620 --> 3:44:10.700]  monkey farm. But entire on entire floor was just how to flicker TV sets for
[3:44:10.700 --> 3:44:14.660]  primates. And he's and it was DARPA documents. He showed it to me. He said,
[3:44:14.660 --> 3:44:19.300]  I'm allowed to show you this, Alex. This in the program was publicly how to
[3:44:19.300 --> 3:44:23.660]  flicker the TV to control our mind, put you in a mesmerized state, then repeat
[3:44:23.660 --> 3:44:28.540]  the questions. Alan, what comment on this? This was known as when they first
[3:44:28.540 --> 3:44:32.180]  give television to the people. And that's why it was given that particular
[3:44:32.180 --> 3:44:36.860]  sequence of flicker rate. And they found initially the people who were
[3:44:36.860 --> 3:44:41.500]  potential epileptics and perhaps had never had a seizure before would have
[3:44:41.500 --> 3:44:47.300]  seizures when they start to do that roll over. Remember, Pokemon? Pokemon in the
[3:44:47.300 --> 3:44:51.980]  mid-1990s causing hundreds of thousands to have convulsions globally? Yes, and then
[3:44:51.980 --> 3:44:56.820]  it was admitted to that the men who designed that particular game worked
[3:44:56.820 --> 3:45:01.340]  for the military industrial complex. So there was a test on the minds of
[3:45:01.340 --> 3:45:06.660]  young children. Everything that we are given electronically really today has an
[3:45:06.660 --> 3:45:11.380]  out to your purpose. That's crossover matching, Alex. That is, that's the
[3:45:11.380 --> 3:45:14.700]  implementation of crossover matching. Just like when you've got a police
[3:45:14.700 --> 3:45:18.580]  officer that approaches you on a stop. If he's calm, cool, and collected, what
[3:45:18.580 --> 3:45:23.100]  he's trying to do is he, you know that he has evil intent. But if you've got a
[3:45:23.100 --> 3:45:29.100]  cop that kind of is running up on you and he is ostentatious and he's
[3:45:29.100 --> 3:45:34.740]  definitely has a confrontation set in mind, the best thing that you can do
[3:45:34.740 --> 3:45:38.700]  is actually just stay calm, cool, and collected and you can cross over match
[3:45:38.700 --> 3:45:43.620]  and actually control his mind. And I know plenty of cops myself, Alex, and let
[3:45:43.620 --> 3:45:47.860]  me tell you, I'm waking them up. Not by one or two or three. I'm talking of
[3:45:47.860 --> 3:45:53.100]  hundreds right now. So I just wanted to call and let you guys know. Kudos, keep
[3:45:53.100 --> 3:45:58.740]  keep moving, and definitely we have Eagles everywhere. Oh, I know that, but the
[3:45:58.740 --> 3:46:01.980]  globalists understand that. That's why there's no telling what they're going to
[3:46:01.980 --> 3:46:08.100]  do. You're going to see a major change over in and a lot of the security
[3:46:08.100 --> 3:46:11.340]  companies as well. And you're going to see a lot of foreigners come in. I think
[3:46:11.340 --> 3:46:16.940]  you're picking up on that, but you know, we all want it to happen overnight. This
[3:46:16.940 --> 3:46:21.140]  country wasn't built overnight and it's going to take it. We're not going to take
[3:46:21.140 --> 3:46:25.460]  it back overnight. So, well, I know a lot of people in the military. I mean,
[3:46:25.460 --> 3:46:30.860]  76% or 77%, I forget, of the donations to Republican candidates went to Ron
[3:46:30.860 --> 3:46:36.300]  Paul. I mean, we know the, I mean, the police say 98% in polls or pro-second
[3:46:36.300 --> 3:46:40.980]  amendment, but they'll still take somebody to jail because the vendor gave
[3:46:40.980 --> 3:46:45.900]  the guy, you know, liquor lemonade for his kid on accident. I mean, you know, I
[3:46:45.900 --> 3:46:50.460]  mean, the cops say they know, but they still follow orders. So true. And they
[3:46:50.460 --> 3:46:55.740]  should have also arrested that vendor that distributed alcohol to a minor as
[3:46:55.740 --> 3:46:59.940]  well. My point is, is that there's no, they've somehow conditioned government
[3:46:59.940 --> 3:47:04.940]  people to like switch off their own thinking process. Right. And exactly.
[3:47:04.940 --> 3:47:08.500]  And in the early nineties, they just made us too smart. And so I think they
[3:47:08.500 --> 3:47:14.020]  realized that, but they were thousands of troops too late at that point. And so I
[3:47:14.020 --> 3:47:16.660]  think that's why the Clinton administration failed. Well, I mean, for
[3:47:16.660 --> 3:47:19.180]  those that don't know, I mean, this is mainstream news for people listening who
[3:47:19.180 --> 3:47:22.820]  don't believe this went on. It's a huge program. And I know it was cut back in
[3:47:22.820 --> 3:47:26.140]  the mid nineties. I mean, I mean, what were they doing? Like hooking you up to
[3:47:26.140 --> 3:47:30.300]  computer screens, virtual reality, different programs. Were they using drugs
[3:47:30.300 --> 3:47:34.460]  in the program you were in? There was no drugs. It was actually all mind
[3:47:34.460 --> 3:47:37.620]  control. And we talk about crossover matching. That's where you actually
[3:47:37.740 --> 3:47:41.860]  monitor the heart rate and you monitor the body movements and you go through
[3:47:41.860 --> 3:47:47.340]  repetitive repetitive motion. If for lack of better words, it's like synchronized
[3:47:47.340 --> 3:47:52.420]  dancing only synchronized fighting and killing at that point. And so once you
[3:47:52.420 --> 3:47:57.660]  implement a person committing a crime or committing a death at that point,
[3:47:57.660 --> 3:48:02.340]  which is a huge threshold, probably the biggest indoctrination into at that
[3:48:02.340 --> 3:48:06.620]  time in that program was the ability to actually kill somebody that people don't
[3:48:06.620 --> 3:48:13.300]  realize, uh, cycle psychologically and morally and soul. Most people have a
[3:48:13.300 --> 3:48:17.820]  exactly. Yeah, most people have a built in even like large elephants fighting
[3:48:17.820 --> 3:48:21.420]  bull males. It's in all mammals. They hold back a little because it would be
[3:48:21.420 --> 3:48:25.860]  bad for the species to be always killing each other. And then, uh, with predator
[3:48:25.860 --> 3:48:29.420]  species, especially with your own species, even sharks tend to have a
[3:48:29.580 --> 3:48:33.100]  disconnect with attacking each other to go over that point and kill your own.
[3:48:33.140 --> 3:48:39.380]  It's not that you're a wimp. Your brain has a governor and the natural born
[3:48:39.380 --> 3:48:43.260]  killers don't have that governor. I might even say in their psychopath, but
[3:48:43.260 --> 3:48:46.780]  people who get in a fight who immediately like anybody, even a scrawny guy walking
[3:48:46.780 --> 3:48:49.500]  down the street, if they totally unleashed on you would kill you pretty
[3:48:49.500 --> 3:48:52.580]  quick. Whereas most people hold back. Is that what you're saying?
[3:48:52.900 --> 3:48:56.900]  That's true. And once you harness the mind, it's the most powerful weapon in
[3:48:56.900 --> 3:49:01.140]  the universe. And then, and, and I know that you drive this home every day is
[3:49:01.140 --> 3:49:05.020]  that there's definitely a war on your four. There's a war going on every day
[3:49:05.020 --> 3:49:09.380]  for everyone's minds. And once you can actually, uh, implement true freedom,
[3:49:09.380 --> 3:49:13.620]  which is control over your mind to make decisions and process information, um,
[3:49:13.660 --> 3:49:18.020]  then you're just a slave. You're just a slave to the system. You might just
[3:49:18.020 --> 3:49:22.220]  wear earplugs everywhere you go and blinders because you will be controlled.
[3:49:22.260 --> 3:49:25.620]  That's it. I appreciate your call. Yeah, I always say, folks, only your children
[3:49:25.620 --> 3:49:29.100]  watch TV. You better indoctrinate him or the government is people say, well,
[3:49:29.100 --> 3:49:32.100]  I'm not going to indoctrinate my children. Well, if you don't, somebody else
[3:49:32.100 --> 3:49:35.820]  is, if you don't program that brain like you're supposed to somebody else and
[3:49:35.820 --> 3:49:39.740]  you got to program it to recognize programming. And yeah, that's why I
[3:49:39.740 --> 3:49:44.100]  don't watch TV because it's so upsetting. The programming is so angering. It
[3:49:44.100 --> 3:49:47.420]  has the opposite effect with me. Alan, can you watch television? Does it make
[3:49:47.420 --> 3:49:51.460]  you get upset? Oh, I can't watch it. I can't watch it. It's so obvious to me
[3:49:51.460 --> 3:49:54.980]  what they're doing. It doesn't matter what you turn on. It's very obvious
[3:49:54.980 --> 3:49:58.860]  immediately what they're doing. Yeah. But I mean, I mean, does it agitate you
[3:49:58.860 --> 3:50:02.060]  like it does me or you just don't? It does. It does, especially when you
[3:50:02.060 --> 3:50:06.420]  haven't watched it for years. And you realize that they're actually giving
[3:50:06.420 --> 3:50:10.460]  this towards what now we're an adult audience. And yet I would have to say
[3:50:10.460 --> 3:50:14.060]  I'd be a child if I accepted what they were telling me in that fashion.
[3:50:14.060 --> 3:50:17.980]  They're talking down to the public now as other children. But most of the
[3:50:17.980 --> 3:50:20.740]  public don't know they've watched television every day and haven't noticed
[3:50:20.740 --> 3:50:26.100]  the changes. They've been habitualized. Yeah. All right. We've got another 30
[3:50:26.100 --> 3:50:30.260]  minutes or so with Alan Watts. Give out his website on the other side. Stay
[3:50:30.260 --> 3:50:33.580]  with us. We're going to continue our discussions during this break right
[3:50:33.580 --> 3:50:37.420]  now. If you're listening on the info wars.com streams, you'll need to listen
[3:50:37.420 --> 3:50:40.300]  there during the overdrive to hear the show. We'll be right back with Alan
[3:50:40.300 --> 3:50:52.100]  Watts. It is a big idea. A new world order in the near future. Earth is
[3:50:52.100 --> 3:50:57.940]  dominated by powerful government is known as the builder bird. But their
[3:50:57.940 --> 3:51:02.500]  objective being world domination or thousands of years, their dark order
[3:51:02.500 --> 3:51:07.820]  group. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of
[3:51:07.820 --> 3:51:15.780]  exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the
[3:51:15.780 --> 3:51:20.020]  elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the

[3:51:27.220 --> 3:51:30.140]  after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's

[3:52:44.220 --> 3:52:48.300]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in
[3:52:48.300 --> 3:52:52.620]  a pH balanced alkaline environment. But as you know most people are overly acidic
[3:52:52.620 --> 3:52:57.620]  due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of
[3:52:57.620 --> 3:53:01.580]  energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease. People
[3:53:01.580 --> 3:53:04.900]  who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar,
[3:53:04.900 --> 3:53:09.100]  mental clarity, and loss of weight. It was intended for human beings to drink
[3:53:09.100 --> 3:53:13.500]  alkaline water. But due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic. The
[3:53:13.500 --> 3:53:17.380]  fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment. Fat
[3:53:17.380 --> 3:53:21.140]  accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't
[3:53:21.140 --> 3:53:26.260]  neutralize it. Do your part. Alkalize and supercharge your body now. Alcovision
[3:53:26.260 --> 3:53:30.540]  plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the
[3:53:30.540 --> 3:53:35.580]  pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops. Order your bottle
