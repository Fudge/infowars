[00:00.000 --> 00:12.380]  Society's don't change. Whether it was the Roman Empire or Nazi Germany, the population
[00:12.380 --> 00:20.400]  is obsessed with sports and petty celebrities. And the United States is no different. MSNBC,
[00:20.400 --> 00:25.280]  the New York Times are all reporting that we are going into a depression, one of the
[00:25.280 --> 00:30.600]  greatest depressions in world history. And our deconant, slob-like public, and that's
[00:30.600 --> 00:35.720]  not everyone, but large percentages of the public, could care less. They're not involved
[00:35.720 --> 00:41.280]  in their communities. We've got 46 states on the verge of bankruptcy. The government's
[00:41.280 --> 00:47.680]  raising taxes on every level. The border with Mexico is collapsing. Mexico has collapsed.
[00:47.680 --> 00:51.840]  And the public doesn't care because the media has set the agenda. And they tell you to care
[00:51.840 --> 00:57.520]  about LeBron James and his decision. And he's playing into it and is going to announce his
[00:57.520 --> 01:03.560]  stupid decision. It doesn't matter what basketball team he goes to. This is a distraction by
[01:03.560 --> 01:10.240]  design. We have the governor of the state he's currently living in in a bizarre We Are LeBron.
[01:10.240 --> 01:25.040]  We are the world literal worship fest with hundreds of celebrities. This is sickening.
[01:25.040 --> 01:32.680]  Imagine the Ohio government begging and pleading on television and serenading LeBron James
[01:32.680 --> 01:37.440]  with hundreds of other celebrities. When Ohio is one of the states slated to go completely
[01:37.440 --> 01:44.160]  bankrupt, we're going into a depression. They're about to launch World War III with Iran openly.
[01:44.160 --> 01:49.840]  Fox News is reporting as if it's a good thing in New York state and Illinois that troops
[01:49.840 --> 01:54.760]  have helped arrest thousands of citizens and are doing gun sweeps in people's homes and
[01:54.760 --> 02:00.680]  searching people's cars. We're going in to martial law. Offshore banks have overthrown
[02:00.680 --> 02:04.800]  the U.S. They've stolen tens of trillions of dollars like we're some third world country
[02:04.800 --> 02:08.640]  they're looting. Everything's going to hell in a handbasket. So if you want to know why
[02:08.640 --> 02:11.560]  your children have no future, if you want to know why you're bankrupt, if you want to
[02:11.560 --> 02:15.640]  know why you're in debt, if you want to know why you have no future and have lost your
[02:15.640 --> 02:21.040]  job or getting your pay cut, it's because your priorities are wrong. It's because you
[02:21.040 --> 02:26.480]  let that idiot box the television program use since the days that your mother and father
[02:26.480 --> 02:31.120]  set you in front of the TV for 12 hours a day in your crap filled diapers. It's not
[02:31.120 --> 02:37.880]  too late to admit we're a sick, decadent, degenerate society crumbling. We are Rome.
[02:37.880 --> 02:42.000]  It's 410. We're about to collapse, ladies and gentlemen. I know you won't know. You
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.160]  know about LeBron James. You don't know 410 is when Rome completely fell to Alaric, the
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.480]  Visigoth leader. You better learn history. This is dangerous. Don't say you weren't
[02:50.480 --> 02:56.440]  warned. The globalist engineers, the globalist social engineers look at you and how pathetic
[02:56.440 --> 03:01.840]  you are and how the whole world is waiting to see where LeBron James goes. The social
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.400]  controllers look at you and see how you're obsessed with LeBron James and they decide
[03:06.400 --> 03:10.320]  we've got a bunch of schmucks. We've got a bunch of idiots. We've got a bunch of morons
[03:10.320 --> 03:14.560]  right where we want them. Let's destroy their society. Let's loot it. Let's pass carbon
[03:14.560 --> 03:18.920]  taxes. Let's expand NAFTA and GATT. Let's announce an end to the dollar as the global
[03:18.920 --> 03:23.040]  reserve currency. Do you know what that means? We've already lost almost all our industry.
[03:23.040 --> 03:26.800]  We're already in a depression when they get rid of the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.160]  Your life, as you know it, is officially over. You're going to be a third world slave like
[03:31.160 --> 03:35.280]  they are in Mexico or Nigeria. And you know what? Those people down there at least know
[03:35.280 --> 03:39.640]  why they're slaves. You are so stupid and so focused on crap, you'll probably still
[03:39.640 --> 03:44.080]  be talking about Lindsay Lohan when you're living as a homeless person on the street.
[03:44.080 --> 03:49.000]  My friends, we've got to set our priorities and set them now. Liberty or tyranny. You've
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.440]  got to wake up and decide what is important to you. Saving our republic, stopping the
[03:53.440 --> 03:59.220]  globalist takeover, or knowing all the mindless trivia about LeBron James and Lindsay Lohan.
[03:59.220 --> 04:05.040]  There isn't much more time. I'm begging you to ask yourselves to look in the mirror and
[04:05.040 --> 04:09.880]  really realize how sick this is. It's not bad like a basketball game, but it is mentally
[04:09.880 --> 04:14.920]  ill and sick to buy into this manufactured hype and to have government officials that
[04:14.920 --> 04:19.560]  should be working for the people sitting there in these disgusting media spectacles
[04:19.560 --> 04:25.360]  worshiping somebody. Our role models, our icons, the people that our children look up
[04:25.360 --> 04:31.480]  to and model themselves after are not inventors and scientists and trailblazers anymore. That's
[04:31.480 --> 04:36.120]  why America has gone from the greatest to the most pathetic in every statistical analysis
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.140]  you look at. And it's only getting worse. We've still got a lot of great people in this country.
[04:40.140 --> 04:46.640]  But with Pete Rose and LeBron James and Michael Vick being our heroes, we're a joke. We're
[04:46.640 --> 04:52.240]  clowns. They've taken our heroes and our role models away. Ladies and gentlemen, you have
[04:52.240 --> 04:58.480]  been warned and this whole LeBron James decision means absolutely nothing. This obsession with
[04:58.480 --> 05:04.600]  petty issues of little or no significance. The fall of America and the western world
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.680]  is an all new 10 hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one. In this film you will

[07:14.560 --> 07:20.480]  is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control.
[07:20.480 --> 07:25.320]  The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the
[07:25.320 --> 07:30.480]  world. Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth
[07:30.480 --> 07:35.560]  for centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I believe first of all that we
[07:35.560 --> 07:40.480]  now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global governance
[07:40.480 --> 07:44.960]  with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then
[07:44.960 --> 07:50.360]  everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else. Invisible Empire. Secure your

[08:23.440 --> 08:36.120]  See a broadcast coming up at the 33 minute mark today for prisonplanet.tv viewers. Okay.
[08:36.120 --> 08:39.720]  Every day we start the broadcast and I make the point that there is a quickening. There
[08:39.720 --> 08:45.800]  is an acceleration in tyranny worldwide, in oppression, in the private offshore banking
[08:45.800 --> 08:56.760]  cartels, bankrupting nations by design, preparing to launch new wars. And we're going to be
[08:56.760 --> 09:03.360]  discussing it all today. But I just want to point out again at the start of the broadcast
[09:03.360 --> 09:22.120]  that what we discuss here is so real, so pertinent, so amazingly vital. Our world is being suffocated,
[09:22.120 --> 09:27.440]  is being enslaved and we must speak out against it. We must all say no to the system. The
[09:27.440 --> 09:34.520]  good news is the awakening is turbocharged. People are concerned. They are beginning to
[09:34.520 --> 09:40.840]  basically engage in a crash course of research to discover how the world really works and
[09:40.840 --> 09:49.080]  who controls our planet and what this criminal power structure is up to. But this morning
[09:49.080 --> 09:59.120]  I saw a story up on infowars.com that completely blew me away. Now I knew this was coming,
[09:59.120 --> 10:08.800]  but to know something is coming and then to actually see it unfold is another thing entirely.
[10:08.800 --> 10:15.360]  And to see the lives and manipulation and how they're rolling this program out against
[10:15.360 --> 10:27.920]  the public. Well, that's the rest of the story. What am I talking about? Fighting gangsters,
[10:27.920 --> 10:36.640]  LA police teach Marines tactics to take down Taliban, train Afghan police, Fox News. Here's
[10:36.640 --> 10:45.240]  another one, MSNBC. Cops show Marines how to take on the Taliban. Can't pendle the Marines
[10:45.240 --> 10:51.280]  went to one of LA's toughest neighborhoods and they helped run checkpoints and pulled
[10:51.280 --> 10:57.400]  citizens over. Now when you read these articles, these are written to sell you on a Marine
[10:57.400 --> 11:05.840]  Corps, regular Marine Corps presence on your streets. When you've been following this for
[11:05.840 --> 11:15.000]  13 years, I've been on air 15, but I really became aware of this about 13 years ago. I
[11:15.000 --> 11:22.600]  became aware of a secret strategic long term program going on since at least the late 1980s
[11:22.600 --> 11:30.680]  with Marines, regular Marines. This is completely illegal. Secretly raiding gun dealers, shops
[11:30.680 --> 11:38.240]  and homes in Virginia and other areas. I then discovered secret programs of regular Army
[11:38.240 --> 11:44.520]  training with emergency managers and county police for gun confiscation. I interviewed
[11:44.520 --> 11:51.960]  emergency managers, police chiefs who discovered it when they were told this was happening.
[11:51.960 --> 11:57.680]  LA Philippus, the police, the chief of police of San Antonio, military veteran himself was
[11:57.680 --> 12:04.120]  approached by Delta force for a secret martial law takeover plan. Thomas Sanchez, the head
[12:04.120 --> 12:11.240]  of emergency management himself, a highly decorated Army officer in Vietnam. They approached
[12:11.240 --> 12:17.440]  him under PDD 25 and said these drills were going to conduct in the county of taking over
[12:17.440 --> 12:26.040]  the city council, the county courthouse and police facilities were for martial law takeover
[12:26.040 --> 12:35.680]  drills of the states. Of course, we have the congressional hearings from the 1980s, 1986
[12:35.680 --> 12:41.220]  with Rex 84, a secret federal program to overthrow the states and take over local governments.
[12:41.220 --> 12:47.800]  This is on record that this has been going on, but they have exponentially expanded the
[12:47.800 --> 12:56.320]  training and the acclamation in California, in Illinois, in Iowa, New York, Massachusetts,
[12:56.320 --> 13:05.160]  Florida, Arizona. We have sent camera men to Maryland, Illinois, the list goes on and
[13:05.160 --> 13:12.440]  on. I have traveled to California. I have witnessed Marines training to take over our
[13:12.440 --> 13:18.440]  cities with role players playing the part of American gun owners being put into processing
[13:18.440 --> 13:24.040]  centers and being face scanned and thumb printed and then being divided up into different areas
[13:24.040 --> 13:31.080]  of the camps. We have documented that the federal government is training now over 50,000
[13:31.080 --> 13:36.720]  prominent preachers and at least a six year old program now called the clergy response
[13:36.720 --> 13:43.160]  team to teach their flocks, their congregations to accept martial law, force denoculations,
[13:43.160 --> 13:48.400]  gun confiscations and processing into camps. What are camps? Your local sports stadium
[13:48.400 --> 13:56.200]  in all the drills. They can turn it into a camp in one hour or less. This is all on record.
[13:56.200 --> 14:02.920]  This is not a conspiracy theory and this is what I cover in my film, police state for
[14:02.920 --> 14:10.080]  the rise of FEMA, 15 years of research all condensed into two hours, 24 minutes. The
[14:10.080 --> 14:16.080]  latest information, whether it's the Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby, you see National
[14:16.080 --> 14:22.240]  Guard out armed with 45s as security. Somebody runs out on the field after the race. They
[14:22.240 --> 14:29.520]  run out and beat them up in front of everyone. I go to New York. It's in my film in game.
[14:29.520 --> 14:35.200]  Troops run across the street when I'm videotaping them armed and begin screaming and cussing
[14:35.200 --> 14:47.600]  at me in America telling me not to tape them. This has nothing, zero, big zero, zip, nada,
[14:47.600 --> 14:56.920]  nil, nothing to do with turban to men in Afghanistan on the CIA payroll, zero. And now it's not
[14:56.920 --> 15:02.960]  once a month I read about a gun confiscation drill in Arcadia, Iowa. It's not once a month
[15:02.960 --> 15:08.120]  I see a governor or the legislature of Illinois calling for National Guard to take part in
[15:08.120 --> 15:14.040]  gun confiscation door to door sweeps. It's not once a month I get footage of National
[15:14.040 --> 15:19.520]  Guard in the middle of nowhere in Oregon, in the middle of farmland, searching people's
[15:19.520 --> 15:26.520]  cars at checkpoints. It is now every single day. They are massively increasing this and
[15:26.520 --> 15:34.440]  we have two years ago, the Army Times reporting brigade homeland, 4,000 battle hardened regular
[15:34.440 --> 15:39.760]  Army troops, the best troops they've got in their own words, training to quote, this is
[15:39.760 --> 15:44.020]  in the Army Times, pull triggers on America. They said we don't like it, but we're trying
[15:44.020 --> 15:50.480]  to pull triggers. That was a quote. Then after a month of me harping on it, the Army Times
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.760]  that not before we saved it at info wars dot com. It's why we do that on key articles.
[15:54.760 --> 16:00.440]  They took the part about pulling triggers out. They excised it. They didn't retract it.
[16:00.440 --> 16:05.280]  They didn't put a blurb and say we were mistaken. They removed those key areas. You read the
[16:05.280 --> 16:11.000]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 concurrently passed the next three years.
[16:11.000 --> 16:18.400]  They say we're training the military to take on states to take over governorships. Now
[16:18.400 --> 16:23.200]  they've set up the 10 member governors council appointed by the president so they can claim,
[16:23.200 --> 16:29.760]  oh, look, we still represent the states. It's the governor's council. Not your governor,
[16:29.760 --> 16:35.560]  not all 50 governors, but 10 hand picked. And then you read the psyops all over the
[16:35.560 --> 16:45.120]  news today. Fox, MSNBC, NBC, AP, all going, oh, the Marines are out doing weapons sweeps.
[16:45.120 --> 16:49.840]  And yeah, they're stopping people at checkpoints, but it's only part of a drill. But remember
[16:49.840 --> 17:00.160]  two years ago, this isn't just the local news. I actually have the chip news. Basin area
[17:00.160 --> 17:14.280]  office, 29 Palms Highway, Joshua Tree, California, contact officer Rob McLeod 760 358 3707 for
[17:14.280 --> 17:21.520]  immediate release December 10th, 2008, chip to conduct sobriety driver license checkpoint
[17:21.520 --> 17:27.880]  with regular US Marines. And then it happened armed Marines went out all over the county
[17:27.880 --> 17:34.240]  pulling citizens over at checkpoints. These are not drills. These are training exercises
[17:34.240 --> 17:41.240]  for full military occupation of the United States by the treacherous treasonous federal
[17:41.240 --> 17:46.600]  government now suing Arizona trying to block the state from simply trying to conduct law
[17:46.600 --> 17:51.360]  and order. Oh, you can have a Marine Corps checkpoint to warrantly search citizens, but
[17:51.360 --> 17:57.120]  you don't have a first contact under law and probable cause when you pull illegal over
[17:57.120 --> 18:01.520]  for speeding or drunk driving and they don't have an ID and they're an illegal alien, you're
[18:01.520 --> 18:06.520]  not to take them to jail. You are to let them go. But if you're a citizen, the book gets
[18:06.520 --> 18:11.360]  thrown at you and the media and the federal government run these giant hoaxes telling
[18:11.360 --> 18:15.200]  you they're going to round up anybody who's Hispanic in America when that's complete
[18:15.200 --> 18:21.520]  boulder dash in these southwestern states more than half the population is Hispanic
[18:21.520 --> 18:25.440]  and more than half the cops are Hispanic. You think Hispanic Americans are going to
[18:25.440 --> 18:31.240]  arrest Hispanic Americans? No. No, they're going to arrest illegal aliens, ladies and
[18:31.240 --> 18:37.960]  gentlemen when they pull them over for drunk driving. So we are witnessing high treason
[18:37.960 --> 18:44.720]  and now they're doing gun sweeps, you name it. And I never even got to this Friday.
[18:44.720 --> 18:54.960]  We have the article up on prisonplanet.com by Steve Watson. 2000 plus arrest aided by
[18:54.960 --> 18:59.880]  the National Guard and that's in the local Fox News newscast in the part two of their
[18:59.880 --> 19:04.320]  report. We covered part one on Thursday where they said, oh, yeah, they have scanners and
[19:04.320 --> 19:07.920]  x-ray scanners for your cars and it shows people driving their cars through them. They
[19:07.920 --> 19:11.000]  show one scanner where they load it in the truck and roll it through the others is where
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.480]  you drive through. And then I said, oh, look, we're also looking for weapons. We've helped
[19:15.480 --> 19:25.240]  seize illegal weapons in New York. And then in the part two, I'm told a part three aired.
[19:25.240 --> 19:29.280]  We covered part one on Thursday that aired Wednesday. We got to some of what happened
[19:29.280 --> 19:32.280]  with part two on Friday that aired Thursday. I'm told a part three aired. I haven't seen
[19:32.280 --> 19:37.280]  it yet. There's so much intel coming in. I can't even watch it all. But in part two,
[19:37.280 --> 19:44.000]  they said, oh, we helped arrest 2000 people, National Guard arresting people with the police.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.680]  This is the federal government engaged in high treason. This is completely illegal.
[19:48.680 --> 19:54.000]  Oh, they whittled down Posse Commentatus, but they didn't get rid of them. And so they're
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.520]  getting ready, ladies and gentlemen, this is really happening. And here's the worst part.
[19:57.520 --> 20:02.360]  They're openly trading with foreign troops. We'll cover that when we get back. It's the
[20:02.360 --> 20:08.400]  number one reason for slow and clogged bathrooms. That's right, hair and the number one way
[20:08.400 --> 20:14.880]  to open drains plugged with hair, the drain claw. Stop standing in dirty bathwater. Stop
[20:14.880 --> 20:20.320]  using dangerous chemicals. Just push the drain claw past the pop up in your sink or tub, twist
[20:20.320 --> 20:25.320]  and pull. You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain. The drain
[20:25.320 --> 20:30.800]  claw has over 100 tiny hooks that claw through hair, toothpaste and shampoo that slows and

[21:03.720 --> 21:09.280]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[21:09.280 --> 21:16.080]  I started survivalistseeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and
[21:16.080 --> 21:25.080]  a single rotating banner ad on prisonplanet.com. Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds
[21:25.080 --> 21:30.520]  of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public. The majority of
[21:30.520 --> 21:38.880]  our customers are Alex Jones listeners. Now I'm offering 50 all organic garden varieties,
[21:38.880 --> 21:45.840]  10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your

[22:02.360 --> 22:06.360]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier
[22:06.360 --> 22:11.040]  gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it. You wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.080]  that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions
[22:15.080 --> 22:19.360]  of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there for you. That's not
[22:19.360 --> 22:24.920]  what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation,
[22:24.920 --> 22:29.000]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure. If all
[22:29.000 --> 22:33.360]  looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold. For the realist, there have never
[22:33.360 --> 22:38.920]  been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001, the US dollar index has
[22:38.920 --> 22:44.800]  tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%. Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their
[22:44.800 --> 22:49.440]  portfolios. You should, too. Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons

[24:06.240 --> 24:12.360]  Think about it. The Pentagon has taken over hundreds of countries. They have financed
[24:12.360 --> 24:20.240]  the overthrow of more than 50, using dictators, rebel groups, bordering nations to go in and
[24:20.240 --> 24:26.360]  overthrow countries that they don't like, or countries whose resources they want to
[24:26.360 --> 24:32.560]  steal and give to globalist corporations. And we have fit the bill as the American people
[24:32.560 --> 24:40.160]  for all of this. I remember in 2001, seeing mainstream news reports in Reuters and the
[24:40.160 --> 24:46.880]  Toronto Star, where agreements were signed as part of the SPP to use Canadian and Mexican
[24:46.880 --> 24:54.880]  troops, quote, to fight American terrorists. We witnessed U.S. troops being used in Canada
[24:54.880 --> 25:03.960]  to, quote, help with security at the Olympic Games just a few months ago. And you see the
[25:03.960 --> 25:12.400]  same thing in England, the same thing in Europe, the same thing in the United States, everywhere.
[25:12.400 --> 25:20.120]  We see the same slow, incremental conditioning of the police being federalized and of foreign
[25:20.120 --> 25:25.000]  troops being used in the United States. Then we had in L.E.O.9 last year with troops from
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.640]  14 countries, quote, training to take on American terrorists, and also, quote, helping with
[25:31.640 --> 25:39.000]  digital surveillance of the American people, wiretapping. These are giant war games against
[25:39.000 --> 25:45.480]  us, but now it's not just war games. It's real army, real National Guard, real bonafide
[25:45.480 --> 25:53.120]  regular Marines, not Marine reserves, out searching Americans armed. That came out in the California
[25:53.120 --> 25:58.680]  papers. We started reporting on and off the press release back in 2008, and then several
[25:58.680 --> 26:06.620]  local papers went out and confirmed armed Marines in some cases by themselves at checkpoints
[26:06.620 --> 26:11.920]  searching citizens and arresting citizens. And then they had, of course, other PR releases
[26:11.920 --> 26:16.280]  in the Army Times, other publications saying, well, the Army is going to be out helping
[26:16.280 --> 26:21.800]  with care flight. You've had a bad car wreck. What's wrong with the army? You know, they're
[26:21.800 --> 26:27.400]  going to help fly you out to safety. Oh, we're going to have, you know, army with jaws of
[26:27.400 --> 26:33.840]  life cutting you out of the vehicle. Oh, and now I've got reports. Oh, the military is
[26:33.840 --> 26:40.760]  going to help do blood draws at DWI checkpoints. Now you have to ask yourself, why has there
[26:40.760 --> 26:50.840]  been a 20 plus year secret program to have Marines raiding gun dealers homes in almost
[26:50.840 --> 26:55.080]  every case? That's what their main target is. This is in road to tyranny that I made
[26:55.080 --> 27:01.680]  eight and a half years ago. We show you the documents. I interview a Marine Corps officer.
[27:01.680 --> 27:11.400]  This is totally illegal. And why did the Marine Corps officer call me in 2000? It was a local
[27:11.400 --> 27:18.200]  TV report at the time I put it in the film in 2002 because he was driving a by 35 from
[27:18.200 --> 27:24.800]  San Antonio and came up to a army checkpoint searching people's vehicles just south of
[27:24.800 --> 27:29.220]  Austin. And he got so upset. He'd been listening to my show and he knew that he'd been part
[27:29.220 --> 27:34.840]  of secret programs that were completely illegal. And then here he was with a national guard
[27:34.840 --> 27:40.080]  wanting to search his vehicle. And so the average person is just carrying all the Marines
[27:40.080 --> 27:44.680]  are training for Afghanistan. You know, when I went to urban warrior with thousands of
[27:44.680 --> 27:52.200]  Marines and troops from at least six foreign nations, Czech Republic, Poland, Israel, England,
[27:52.200 --> 27:57.000]  Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, France. I don't know how many is that? That's more
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.360]  than six. And I witnessed them with the role players going, I'm an American. No, not the
[28:02.360 --> 28:05.880]  camp and them saying, where did you get this helmet? Where'd you get this gun? Well, I
[28:05.880 --> 28:11.720]  got it in San Francisco. Then I went home to my hotel room that night and turned on
[28:11.720 --> 28:20.760]  singing and they'd been there and they said troops are training for Serbia and Macedonia.
[28:20.760 --> 28:25.720]  Total lie. I interviewed Colonel Love of the Marines, one of the commanders. He admitted
[28:25.720 --> 28:32.580]  it was for international and domestic. That's all in police state 2000. They have a huge
[28:32.580 --> 28:38.680]  covert secret program on record to take your guns and they're training with foreign troops.
[28:38.680 --> 28:44.560]  And then what a month ago, I sent Rob do and Jason Douglas. They filed a 25 minute report
[28:44.560 --> 28:57.040]  at prisonplanet.tv. They filed a 25 minute special report. That story should be mega
[28:57.040 --> 29:02.880]  viral right now. They went up to Illinois and witnessed Polish troops and other Eastern
[29:02.880 --> 29:10.840]  block troops with the army, National Guard and regular army all over the surrounding
[29:10.840 --> 29:15.200]  area of Chicago. And then the day they left and had to catch their flight, they're at
[29:15.200 --> 29:18.640]  the drill and they said, oh, there's an unscheduled drill you guys can come to. We're going to
[29:18.640 --> 29:24.640]  be at the local sports stadium doing a civil unrest drill. But the guys already had their
[29:24.640 --> 29:28.760]  tickets and had to get on the plane and leave. The point is there was even more scheduled
[29:28.760 --> 29:34.120]  with foreign troops. And the guys didn't call me. I'd have told them just ditch the thousand
[29:34.120 --> 29:38.120]  dollars in tickets or so and stay there. But of course they've been away from their families
[29:38.120 --> 29:42.600]  five days, but they got most of it. It's just it's always worse than you can imagine. Foreign
[29:42.600 --> 29:47.240]  troops and regular army and Marines are training to take your guns and put you in concentration
[29:47.240 --> 29:56.120]  camps. Do you understand this is real? We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex
[29:56.120 --> 30:03.660]  Jones and the GCN radio network. Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. You've heard me talk

[31:01.120 --> 31:06.040]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[31:06.040 --> 31:11.840]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution which
[31:11.840 --> 31:16.640]  protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on
[31:16.640 --> 31:21.080]  what's for dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children,
[31:21.080 --> 31:27.280]  our education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[31:27.280 --> 31:33.080]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the facts. We
[31:33.080 --> 31:37.360]  have the constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law. Knowledge is power,
[31:37.360 --> 31:41.600]  ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise
[31:41.600 --> 31:46.040]  of the Republic. Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American
[31:46.040 --> 31:52.480]  people is rising. A new tool in the Info War. Don't Tread on Me. Order it at infowars.com

[31:59.920 --> 32:00.920]  films.
[32:00.920 --> 32:05.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[32:05.560 --> 32:09.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:09.920 --> 32:14.240]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[32:14.240 --> 32:19.320]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[32:19.320 --> 32:21.280]  grid technology is coming.
[32:21.280 --> 32:25.600]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[32:25.600 --> 32:30.600]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[32:30.600 --> 32:34.800]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their
[32:34.800 --> 32:36.800]  power from weather-related onages.
[32:36.800 --> 32:41.560]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[32:41.560 --> 32:45.280]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[32:45.280 --> 32:46.680]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[32:53.600 --> 33:19.760]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:19.760 --> 33:25.080]  Thank you for joining us, my friends. We are live here on the radio and we're simulcasting
[33:25.080 --> 33:33.400]  the balance of the broadcast at prisonplanet.tv. Coming up at 1 o'clock Central Standard Time
[33:33.400 --> 33:39.320]  today, Peter Schiff will be joining us. He is, of course, an author, businessman, financial
[33:39.320 --> 33:45.000]  commentator, economic advisor to Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign and 2010 candidate
[33:45.000 --> 33:52.120]  for the United States Senate. He will be joining us coming up in the last hour today and we're
[33:52.120 --> 33:57.200]  also going to be opening the phones up when he joins us.
[33:57.200 --> 34:04.000]  I specifically want to open the phones up for listeners to talk about the economy, to
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.040]  give me your take on the fact that they are now admitting that Marines are helping run
[34:10.040 --> 34:15.200]  checkpoints all over California, but the mainstream media is spinning it, saying it's for training
[34:15.200 --> 34:21.480]  overseas. When we have their actual press releases, that it is for domestic operations.
[34:21.480 --> 34:25.960]  It is completely illegal. Also, there's a Senate bill to make airport body scanners
[34:25.960 --> 34:33.760]  mandatory federal law so that you couldn't refuse these. They now admit, depending on
[34:33.760 --> 34:38.760]  the scanner, type 20 to 50 times the cancer risk. They had previously said they are recording
[34:38.760 --> 34:44.200]  your naked body. Also, it made big national news on the Drudge Report and quite a few
[34:44.200 --> 34:48.600]  newspapers picked up and reported over the weekend on my little five and a half minute
[34:48.600 --> 34:52.960]  video about LeBron James and the fact that people are obsessed with issues of little
[34:52.960 --> 34:57.080]  or no significance. I have an article I want to read that Paul Watson wrote about that
[34:57.080 --> 35:02.480]  today dealing with the brainwashing that's going on and how the mainstream media tries
[35:02.480 --> 35:08.360]  to set the agenda to be issues of little or no significance so that the public fills
[35:08.360 --> 35:13.880]  their mind with mindless fluff instead of actually being involved in real issues. Chicago has
[35:13.880 --> 35:18.400]  now passed their new law. It says if you take five hours of training and the government
[35:18.400 --> 35:23.480]  decides you can have a firearms permit, you can jump through all these hoops and pay a
[35:23.480 --> 35:28.520]  fee and basically take psychological testing as part of the five hours. And then if they
[35:28.520 --> 35:33.040]  decide you can have the privilege, then you can have a gun locked up in your house but
[35:33.040 --> 35:39.960]  can't even have it on your porch or take it outside your home. And now nationally, this
[35:39.960 --> 35:46.720]  is what the Supreme Court is saying our Second Amendment means, a highly restricted privilege.
[35:46.720 --> 35:50.720]  That's the same way they basically went from guns being completely legal in New York in
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.760]  the last 60 years to being completely illegal in New York City. Oh, there's still a route
[35:55.760 --> 36:01.080]  to get a concealed permit or a gun license in New York, but very few are able to get
[36:01.080 --> 36:07.520]  it. So we'll also be discussing that key issue. And we're also seeing a big push for the
[36:07.520 --> 36:14.320]  carbon tax once again. In fact, there's a Stan Cox article in the Washington Post today
[36:14.320 --> 36:20.120]  in the heat wave, the case against air conditioning. And they go on to say that the 100 plus degree
[36:20.120 --> 36:26.680]  weather must be global warming when the East Coast routinely goes above 100 degrees. And
[36:26.680 --> 36:32.800]  then they continued to say that we need to ban air conditioners. And I see articles in
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.480]  the New York Times last week calling for a one-child policy here in the United States.
[36:37.480 --> 36:42.800]  In fact, the BBC is reporting global population study launched by Royal Society calling for
[36:42.800 --> 36:47.560]  a global population reduction to stop the carbon that humans exhale. And here's another
[36:47.560 --> 36:54.280]  one, UN World Population Day 2010, Beijing announces measures to stop unauthorized births,
[36:54.280 --> 36:59.880]  including forced abortion and accelerated infanticide. So we're going to be breaking
[36:59.880 --> 37:13.520]  that down as well today. The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231-1800-2599-9231
[37:13.520 --> 37:19.440]  to discuss any of these issues. I also want to get into what's happening with the states.
[37:19.440 --> 37:28.960]  Like this Fox News headline, struggling states seek more aid from Washington. And it says
[37:28.960 --> 37:35.760]  governors hamstrung by the sluggish economy rebound in their states, sluggish rebound,
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.840]  are bound to balance their own budgets, are passing and pressing anew for Washington to
[37:40.840 --> 37:47.040]  step up more help. Some say it means adding to the nation's red ink. You got to love that.
[37:47.040 --> 37:51.640]  The states are where the tax money comes from. The feds take it, give most of it to the offshore
[37:51.640 --> 37:55.280]  banks that have bought off the federal government, and then send a little bit of money back with
[37:55.280 --> 38:00.400]  strings attached. And I see all these newscasts with locals from all over the country saying,
[38:00.400 --> 38:04.800]  we need the army on the streets of Schenectady, New York. You know, we need them to carry
[38:04.800 --> 38:10.800]  out police work. We need martial law in Schenectady. We need martial law in Illinois. We need
[38:10.800 --> 38:17.720]  martial law in Iowa. The feds have got all the free money. I mean, they're not having
[38:17.720 --> 38:22.640]  mayors suddenly all over the country. Every week I see another mayor calling for, quote,
[38:22.640 --> 38:26.800]  martial law. They're even using that term. I saw one of the city council members last
[38:26.800 --> 38:33.400]  year in Milwaukee call for martial law. They're just, that'll fix it. Let's just have troops.
[38:33.400 --> 38:37.840]  And all over the country, mayors say there's now a daytime curfew. We're going to be searching
[38:37.840 --> 38:46.160]  cars city-wide and asking why you're out at 12 noon in Arkansas and Oklahoma. And we
[38:46.160 --> 38:49.840]  need to inspect your home gardens to make sure you're not growing marijuana. You're
[38:49.840 --> 38:54.840]  guilty until proven innocent. We know what authoritarianism is. We know what it looks
[38:54.840 --> 39:01.160]  like. It's here. And the states are saying, oh, feds, please give us money. Meanwhile,
[39:01.160 --> 39:07.720]  the illegal aliens, especially in the Southwestern states, are the main deciding factor bankrupt
[39:07.720 --> 39:13.320]  investing state budgets, the free healthcare, the free births of babies, the jail and prison
[39:13.320 --> 39:21.240]  populations in many cities in the Southwest are over half illegal alien. But God forbid,
[39:21.240 --> 39:26.440]  we actually stem the tide of illegals pouring in predominantly from Latin America that's
[39:26.440 --> 39:30.640]  in its own depression. I mean, it's worse than a depression to Mexico. No, no, no. We
[39:30.640 --> 39:36.080]  need to have more red ink and raise taxes even more when that only further stalls the
[39:36.080 --> 39:40.840]  economy, which then again bankrupts the states to a greater extent. And then the feds themselves
[39:40.840 --> 39:46.840]  globalized, they come in and take over the states. And their answer is Marines and army
[39:46.840 --> 39:53.840]  and police at checkpoints. Here's the headline New York National Guard involved in mass arrest
[39:53.840 --> 39:57.840]  of U.S. citizens. I'm going to play a clip of this in the next hour. Here's another one,
[39:57.840 --> 40:05.200]  Fox News. This is out on Sunday, yesterday, July 11th, fighting gangsters. LA police teach
[40:05.200 --> 40:10.640]  Marines tactics to take down Taliban train Afghan police, but actually have the police
[40:10.640 --> 40:17.520]  press releases here. They admit in these press releases that they're actually arresting people.
[40:17.520 --> 40:23.200]  This is real. This is illegal. This is tyranny. This is so incredible. And I kept telling you
[40:23.200 --> 40:28.600]  this was coming and they're just rolling it out now everywhere. But we can't have troops
[40:28.600 --> 40:33.240]  on the border. Oh, Marines can set up checkpoints and search citizens all over the country.
[40:33.240 --> 40:37.520]  But God forbid if you pull over a drunk driver and then they're an illegal alien, whether
[40:37.520 --> 40:42.800]  they be from Russia or Mexico or wherever else, you're not allowed to arrest them. You're
[40:42.800 --> 40:45.440]  not allowed to even ask for their ID. If they don't have an ID, you're supposed to let
[40:45.440 --> 40:50.440]  them go. This is a sick joke. Oh, yes, the government are a bunch of civil libertarians.
[40:50.440 --> 40:55.000]  They care so much about the illegal aliens rights. Nobody's violating their rights.
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.320]  Here it is cops show Marines how to take on Taliban. But then you actually read what
[40:59.320 --> 41:11.600]  they're doing. This is a scythe. And of course, here's our article from years ago. Marine
[41:11.600 --> 41:18.160]  presence confirmed. Again, there we are two years ago covering it. And now here it is
[41:18.160 --> 41:27.720]  in Fox News and NBC LA two years later or a year and a half later, I guess December 2008
[41:27.720 --> 41:37.680]  this year and a half. And the crazy thing is Steve Watson and Paul Watson wrote this
[41:37.680 --> 41:46.160]  article New York National Guard involved in mass arrest of US citizens. And somebody
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.080]  made a YouTube video about this. We haven't made one. And I just happened to happen across
[41:50.080 --> 41:55.160]  it and saw the comments that were clearly psyops going, Alex is a liar. You know, the
[41:55.160 --> 42:02.880]  National Guard isn't out there doing gun confiscation. Why they assisted in 2000 drug arrest in this
[42:02.880 --> 42:09.160]  one area of New York state. And then you go watch part one and part two of the newscast.
[42:09.160 --> 42:15.160]  They admit they're doing gun arrest, gun sweeps. Mayors are calling for martial law in those
[42:15.160 --> 42:23.280]  cities likes connectivity. And they did help arrest 2000 people. That's the headline. And
[42:23.280 --> 42:28.560]  they're going after guns as well as part of that. But but people are in denial. You know,
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.000]  these same people would deny that the military was already being used in law enforcement
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.120]  activities a few years ago. Now that it's all admitted mainstream news, they say, okay,
[42:37.120 --> 42:40.760]  that's fine. But Alex, you're a liar. What am I lying about? What have we been wrong
[42:40.760 --> 42:45.200]  about? We told you derivatives 11 years ago would cause the country to go bankrupt by
[42:45.200 --> 42:52.800]  design. Now it's all admitted. We told you they lied about WMDs in Iraq. Now it's admitted.
[42:52.800 --> 42:57.640]  We told you that the CIA was protecting the Taliban in Al Qaeda and growing the opium.
[42:57.640 --> 43:02.520]  Now it's admitted. I mean, what else do you have to see come true that we discuss? I know
[43:02.520 --> 43:07.360]  what I'm talking about. You can know what you're talking about. You can become just
[43:07.360 --> 43:12.520]  as informed as I am if you'll actually start researching history and how the Pentagon has
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.800]  taken over countless nations. What's the number one danger in history, whether it was Rome
[43:17.800 --> 43:26.480]  2,000 years ago or Babylon 2,500 years ago? What was the greatest threat in Alexander
[43:26.480 --> 43:33.520]  the Great's time? His father was killed in a coup d'etat. He was only a Macedonian king,
[43:33.520 --> 43:37.720]  not one of the full kings, you know, from southern Greece. They had regional kings at
[43:37.720 --> 43:45.400]  the time and his father at a military inspection, one of the Greeks who supported another rival
[43:45.400 --> 43:49.240]  family there when he was inspecting thousands of troops because they were in the middle
[43:49.240 --> 43:55.120]  of a war through a javelin through the heart of Alexander the Great's father. And there
[43:55.120 --> 44:00.040]  was a military coup. But then they fought that off and Alexander got back into control
[44:00.040 --> 44:04.840]  and then realized that he had to go ahead and conquer all of Greece to secure his area
[44:04.840 --> 44:09.520]  because there were rival clans always trying to overthrow Macedonia. What's the number
[44:09.520 --> 44:12.720]  one threat in the third world? What are you always hearing about in Africa and poorer
[44:12.720 --> 44:16.640]  areas of Asia and Latin America? Every couple of months you hear about a military coup.
[44:16.640 --> 44:23.600]  I mean, they're going on constantly because if you've got a group with the weapons and
[44:23.600 --> 44:27.880]  you've got a group that's in control of the intelligence and you've got a group that's
[44:27.880 --> 44:31.920]  got the funding, they're going to overthrow your government. But it's more sophisticated
[44:31.920 --> 44:36.800]  than that here. You've got this offshore corporate group that's engaged in all these
[44:36.800 --> 44:43.120]  takeovers. They use our military as their muscle. They've brainwashed the troops. They
[44:43.120 --> 44:48.200]  have gotten their Rhodes scholars and their Council on Foreign Relations and their Woodrow
[44:48.200 --> 44:53.400]  Wilson School of International Affairs Generals. Look at where McChrystal and look at where
[44:53.400 --> 45:01.360]  Betrayus, Betrayus and all of these people are calling Betrayus so much now that's his
[45:01.360 --> 45:07.960]  actual name in my mind. They all go to these special schools. They become a general, a
[45:07.960 --> 45:14.320]  one-star general, then they disappear for two to four years into one of five global training
[45:14.320 --> 45:20.160]  schools that are above PhD level that openly call for world government and then they come
[45:20.160 --> 45:25.340]  out and are put into a higher position of power and they end up being on the Joint
[45:25.340 --> 45:31.760]  Chiefs of Staff or the Heads of SENTCOM or NORTHCOM or SOUTHCOM or AFRICON, AFRICORE,
[45:31.760 --> 45:36.840]  all of this. This is how they govern. This is how they control. And so they know the
[45:36.840 --> 45:41.320]  American people. They know the only threat to this global corporate illegitimate criminal
[45:41.320 --> 45:45.720]  treasonous treacherous takeover of our country that is the New World Order is the American
[45:45.720 --> 45:51.320]  people taking their states back and getting control of the federal government that way.
[45:51.320 --> 45:54.760]  That's why they can't let Arizona fix the problem with the open borders and the crime
[45:54.760 --> 45:59.680]  wave. That's why they want the states bankrupt under federal control. That's why they want
[45:59.680 --> 46:04.040]  the states always with unfunded mandates to not be able to pay their bills, federally
[46:04.040 --> 46:10.400]  unfunded mandates. That's the goal. That's how they took down all these third world countries.
[46:10.400 --> 46:15.560]  We have the IMF World Bank plans from 2002, how they done this to countless nations and
[46:15.560 --> 46:20.640]  how they were planning it in Europe, the United States, England, Australia, New Zealand, Canada.
[46:20.640 --> 46:25.200]  And now it's happening. I mean, if I have their actual blueprints, if I have their actual
[46:25.200 --> 46:32.240]  battle plans, how am I not supposed to come up here and warn you? I'm not that smart.
[46:32.240 --> 46:36.880]  I've learned history. I've studied history. How governments operate. How elites operate.
[46:36.880 --> 46:42.280]  How they do it. And the number one threat is any corrupt elite coming in and buying off
[46:42.280 --> 46:47.400]  your government, buying off your military, promising them even more power if they help
[46:47.400 --> 46:52.000]  have a overthrow of the country. And if you look at England, if you look at Australia,
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.400]  if you look at Canada, look at the United States, it's all the same. You see the same
[46:55.400 --> 47:04.120]  articles. Oh, to help with security and to bolster security right now at the G20 or in
[47:04.120 --> 47:12.400]  Toronto or in Illinois or in California. Oh, we're going to have army out at checkpoints.
[47:12.400 --> 47:17.240]  And you see the same stories written the same way everywhere. And they're shaken back
[47:17.240 --> 47:24.800]  articles. No matter how many times you buy the same pancake mix and it says take two
[47:24.800 --> 47:31.520]  eggs and this much milk and stir it up and then put it on the griddle. These articles
[47:31.520 --> 47:38.440]  are like box pancakes. It doesn't matter if it's Australia, England, Northern Ireland,
[47:38.440 --> 47:45.560]  the United States, Germany. It's the same report over and over and over and over again.
[47:45.560 --> 47:50.320]  The names are changed. The names of the towns are changed. This is a strategic creeping
[47:50.320 --> 48:03.560]  death takeover of our society. Now I want to go to Joe and John and Redneck and Vic and
[48:03.560 --> 48:16.040]  JG and others here in just a moment. And we're going to take calls to the bottom of the next
[48:16.040 --> 48:25.040]  hour and then I'm going to cover governor's voice grave concern over immigration, the latest
[48:25.040 --> 48:29.840]  on the immigration developments and the states rights fight in Arizona. I'm going to get
[48:29.840 --> 48:35.840]  into the economy. I'm going to get into LeBron Nation. Americans hypnotized as country collapses.
[48:35.840 --> 48:45.240]  Key new article by Paul Watson up on prisonplanet.com. Then I'm going to get into these newscasts
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.440]  from around the country where they openly roll out martial law by stealth. They're not
[48:49.440 --> 48:55.840]  going to announce martial law overnight. They're just going to incrementally do it. You understand
[48:55.840 --> 49:02.840]  that in the late 90s, I interviewed on air Thomas Sanchez, emergency manager, LA Philippus,
[49:02.840 --> 49:08.680]  chief of police San Antonio, countless people and we would send camera men or I would go
[49:08.680 --> 49:15.640]  and I would have Marines and army walk up to me and my camera men would with their guns
[49:15.640 --> 49:22.680]  in Main Street, USA and say you turn your camera off. I've had the army with Marines
[49:22.680 --> 49:31.680]  do it in Belton, Texas. I've witnessed our camera guys in Brooksville, Florida. This
[49:31.680 --> 49:39.680]  happened to us. I have got the footage of it happening in Hebron, Maryland in Swansboro.
[49:39.680 --> 49:44.400]  The list goes on and on. You haven't experienced the tyranny till you've been there. I mean
[49:44.400 --> 49:50.120]  I tried to cover Brooksville, Florida and announced I was going to cover an urban warfare
[49:50.120 --> 49:55.360]  takeover drill because people inside the army had told me that this was a practice takeover
[49:55.360 --> 50:02.760]  drill of the airport, the local municipal airport with the local police, a roundup drill
[50:02.760 --> 50:06.280]  and I got there and we interviewed people. This is in police state to the takeover and
[50:06.280 --> 50:09.640]  I'm walking around in neighborhoods in Brooksville, Florida and women come out and go, yeah, are
[50:09.640 --> 50:15.120]  you Alex Jones? The army came and knocked on my door and said, don't talk to you that
[50:15.120 --> 50:24.560]  you are a dangerous cook and then I'm sitting there trying to videotape through the municipal
[50:24.560 --> 50:29.600]  airport fence at night totally legal and they have a special forces guy jump out of the
[50:29.600 --> 50:35.000]  bushes and start trying to light fires blaming me for it and I've got to start stomping them
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.120]  out and I've got to physically begin restraining the person from doing it. I mean these people
[50:40.120 --> 50:45.360]  are jumping out with lighters. Troops in plain clothes jumping out with lighters lighting
[50:45.360 --> 50:49.400]  fires. These are terrorists, ladies and gentlemen. They have been trained to engage in black
[50:49.400 --> 50:55.240]  ops against the American people because they're going to take your pension funds. They're
[50:55.240 --> 51:02.640]  going to loot this country. We're being militarily conquered. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[51:02.640 --> 51:06.120]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water
[51:06.120 --> 51:10.240]  filtration. As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands

[52:06.280 --> 52:12.640]  in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution
[52:12.640 --> 52:17.520]  which protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting
[52:17.520 --> 52:22.040]  on what's for dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children,
[52:22.040 --> 52:28.280]  our education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate. Somebody
[52:28.280 --> 52:34.280]  is going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the facts, we have

[54:26.400 --> 54:31.640]  to make it clear. A lot of people say, I don't care if they have military checkpoints. I
[54:31.640 --> 54:37.140]  don't care if they search my car, I have nothing to hide. Ladies and gentlemen, I see reports
[54:37.140 --> 54:41.600]  every week where police pull somebody over with guns in their trunk, even in places like
[54:41.600 --> 54:45.200]  Texas and they're not illegal, and the cops just go ahead and arrest you and take the
[54:45.200 --> 54:52.720]  guns, you never even get them back. Even when you sue them, remember Katrina. Remember
[54:52.720 --> 55:01.560]  what happened there. The establishment hasn't had a 20-plus year secret program to merge
[55:01.560 --> 55:07.840]  the police and the military and to train them to work together against the people for nothing.
[55:07.840 --> 55:11.000]  The globalists took over the society a long time ago and they said, why don't we just
[55:11.000 --> 55:16.080]  use the U.S. as an engine for global domination? They said, well, why don't we just start robbing
[55:16.080 --> 55:19.880]  the people blind? Well, they'll get angry, they'll get upset, they could take the states
[55:19.880 --> 55:27.040]  back, we'll just get the states in debt, buy them off, we'll federalize local police by
[55:27.040 --> 55:32.360]  stealth, and then we'll stage terror attacks as a pretext to clamp down on the public,
[55:32.360 --> 55:36.480]  and the public will be told we're doing this for their safety. Okay, let's do it just as
[55:36.480 --> 55:40.840]  long as we don't get caught. Just as long as we're in control. We're in control. Let's
[55:40.840 --> 55:45.720]  do it. Hell, look how many countries we've overthrown using this army. We'll do it here
[55:45.720 --> 55:57.320]  in the U.S. That's the new world order in a nutshell. And none of us are safe, my friends.
[55:57.320 --> 56:02.080]  None of us are safe. It is time to wake up to these realities. It's time to wake up to
[56:02.080 --> 56:11.880]  these facts now and understand just how serious, just how serious this really is. I want to

[59:55.160 --> 01:00:07.160]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:15.440]  Another mainstream media government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:23.560]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:31.240]  It's hour number two on this Monday, the 12th day of July 2010. And we are going to be going
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.800]  to your phone calls momentarily here at the bottom of the hour. I'm going to start going
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:42.560]  over a ton of economic news, police state news, land grabbing news, but also a lot of great
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:48.600]  people are starting to counter all of this. But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.000]  Let's go ahead and speak to Joe in Texas. Joe, welcome.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  Hello, Alex. Are you sir? Good.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.680]  Alex, I just think gunsmith up your fellow country. Remember, I wanted to get, you know,
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:10.560]  the Bible says, and two witnesses, confirmation. And because of you, I use a lot of discernment.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.640]  My sister has bought some property up here in the Hill Country, lives in Beaumont. The
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:22.520]  reason I called Alex is she had direct TV installation installed. And the man who installed
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:29.280]  it just got back, had been back for three months from Iraq, had done three years. Communication
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:35.120]  specialist. The man told me, we were talking, we were sharing war stories. I was telling
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:42.080]  him about simple in South America, Manuel Noriega, all of that. He was telling me that
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:50.400]  he was that a lack is under martial law, his words. He also said that two of his friends
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:56.680]  were in this stop loss thing. They got back and they turned around and sent them to Afghanistan.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:03.320]  The man who spent three years with him, in Iraq, is now back and is in the National Guard
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:09.800]  Reserve. He called him. He's quoted to me this three days ago. I'm sorry, it was on
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:19.640]  Thursday, Alex, last week, that his friend stated to him, they are gearing up for martial
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:28.680]  law and from Texas City to Florida, they already have the tents confirming what you said about
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:35.960]  putting these tents in stadiums, his words, that they are talking about evacuation from
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:43.800]  the coastline, 50 miles inland. They are geared up for his friend's words and confirmed
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:49.120]  that. He also stated to me that, of course, you already know, Alex, from your VESCA work
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:55.960]  that all calls that are called from or to the United States has monitored anything said
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.160]  about the government, commanding officers, things of that nature. They are cut off from
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:08.000]  their family and phone conversation, but they do have the tents in trucks. His friend stated
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.920]  to him in the service, the man's name is Greg. I have his home phone number. Really nice,
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:19.240]  man. Said that they do have tents in place to put in stadiums. Well, by the way, by the
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.600]  way, it's not that I'm psychic. I've been to countless urban warfare drills. The guys
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.920]  were just in Chicago. In fact, cold doing here, I forget the name of the stadium, but
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.320]  they use the big stadium as a drill to lock people down in it and put them in a camp.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:37.200]  So people keep asking where the camps are. That's why the feds always push for bond
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.720]  proposals at the state and county and city level. The sports stadiums are the FEMA camps.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.800]  The sports stadiums are the FEMA camps hidden in plain view, but what I'm going to do is
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:53.040]  after I take this round of calls, come on in, do what sports stadium was that they had
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:59.560]  the, the, uh, civil unrest in, in Chicago, Toyota park and also doing stuff at a giant
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.840]  uh, uh, soldier field, soldier field was another one, but Toyota park was where we
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.080]  were at and filmed. Yeah. Thank you. And I mean, they just admit this. So, uh, I mean,
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.280]  I've been there and I read all the press releases by the military. They train with foreign
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:16.920]  troops to take your families, take your kids. They put the women in one area, the men in
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:22.400]  another, they take your kids, the CPS has their way with them. The military just, folks,
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:26.800]  and we're so trained to worship the military, the military. It's like Nazi Germany. The,
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.080]  the German soldiers by and large weren't bad, but their leader Adolf Alois Hitler was bad.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.880]  I'm sure the Russian army wasn't bad, but Stalin was bad. And I mean, I'm sorry, a Russian
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:41.000]  soldier tries to take, I mean, what else did he say? I mean, did he say his friend was
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.800]  concerned about this job? Uh, he said, Alex, that it's from Texas city, excuse me, but
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:54.120]  Texas city to Florida in all stadiums, local county stay there, stay there, Joe. I'm going
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:05:03.000]  to come back to you because I want to break this down.

[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:09.720]  to wait.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:48.580]  It's already martial law when they say it's a federal felony to videotape the police
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:53.380]  and military and you have the general, the admiral in charge of the Coast Guard saying
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:58.160]  that a week and a half ago. We read the quotes, we played the clips. That is martial law.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.600]  They just don't tell you it's martial law. Martial law is rolling up to a checkpoint
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.200]  and Austin police taking blood without warrants. That's in the news today and they say they're
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.840]  going to videotape while they take your blood. And that's a federal grant. Your police being
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:17.520]  under federal control is martial law, but it's a continuum. Martial law is a graph,
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.720]  okay? And that's that article I wrote with Ed Holman 12 years ago. Martial law is here
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.880]  and it's a three on the Richter scale. That guy's Googled that article. See, we can pull
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.400]  it up. It's in an old info wars format. Martial law and it's a three on the Richter scale.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:39.520]  And I show army checkpoint, regular army in Belton. And then again, years later in 2000,
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:43.440]  I went up there and the troops came up and said, you were here before. Get out of here.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:49.720]  And then Marines came over and they started trying to threaten us. I mean, they're training
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:55.200]  to take over and they use PR things like, oh, bomb disposal training. Oh, anti-drunk driving
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:01.040]  checkpoints. And then now, oh, we're here to fight terrorist. And so, yes, all over the
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.880]  country, they've got old military bases. They refurbished that they admit in the National
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:12.800]  Centers Act they will use as FEMA camps. But the main thing that they have set up,
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.280]  the main thing that they've deployed is battle plans in every city and even small towns to
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:24.560]  use your soccer field, your football stadium, these Walmart distribution centers. I was
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.120]  told that many years before I then saw mainstream articles. You know, you get intel, you don't
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.000]  know if it's real, but you file it. And then you see an article Walmart says during a
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  flu outbreak, they've done a deal with Homeland Security to use distribution centers as places
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.920]  for people to be held. I mean, you just do this day after day, you get a very clear
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.920]  crystal clear picture. But now I don't have to have a crystal clear picture for my own
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:56.080]  intel. It's all out in the open. Now, let me say this. This is so important. And please
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:03.920]  listen to me carefully. Please remember in January of last year, we had the interview
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:09.040]  with the emergency manager from Indiana. It came out in several newspapers there that
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.560]  emergency managers in Illinois and Indiana didn't know why they were being told flu will
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:21.920]  be horrible this year. Millions will die. There will be martial law. This was in 2009.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:27.360]  Now this is two plus months before in the middle of April, the out of season wrong hemisphere,
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.040]  wrong time of year, flu showed up and you're going to, I'm going to connect this in a moment.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:37.760]  In the wrong time of year, wrong hemisphere, everything, this novel flu with no
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:46.960]  genealogy, with no family tree because flu has a genetic history, just shows up out of nowhere.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:52.480]  The media admits that this was engineered, that this was manufactured somehow. Now let's go back.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:00.080]  I get intel out of Indiana, then I get intel out of California, then I get intel out of Arizona,
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:06.640]  then I get intel out of New York. And that was the last key piece I got when I went red level on
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:11.520]  air and started saying emergency, emergency, emergency in January and February and March
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.560]  and then into April. So three months before. You remember every day I said red alert, red alert,
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.960]  flu is coming, flu is coming. We don't know if this is going to be a real flu. We don't know
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:26.800]  if it's going to be a binary weapon or a tracker simulant because I'd seen documents about them
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:33.920]  having an H1N1 simulant, attenuated virus that they had quote released to track how flu would
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:39.680]  spread. We weren't sure, but we had all these key pieces and we knew that all over the country police
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:45.920]  were being trained for martial law and for millions dead. I mean, they said look for a million dead
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:52.160]  out of Chicago alone being buried over the border in that area of Indiana. And we had those interviews
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.280]  here on air with the emergency manager protecting his name. And then we had other reporters on
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.680]  from mainstream publications who had also confirmed the man's identity here on air
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.000]  because this journalist, we can't tell you a secret source's name, but if I can have a
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.080]  mainstream reporter on as well to confirm that they know who their name is, they've interviewed
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:16.640]  them as well. That's a double proof for you. But then we got the key piece of intel. We got the
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:24.000]  Bureau of Cemetery. In fact, the headline from Aaron Dykes was, because he wrote a story about it,
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.320]  was mass grave preparation confirmed. And you guys did a great job pulling up the martial law
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:33.200]  on it's number three on the Richter scale article. I try to pull up Aaron's headline. It was infowars.com.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:40.480]  Believe that one was by March. We had confirmed it and it was mass grave plans confirmed.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.000]  And we, because you can read with phone numbers and names, you can call them
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:53.600]  a bureau of cemeteries, department of cemeteries plan in New York state for millions of dead.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.760]  They were going to all the main cemeteries and saying, can you bury 100,000 here from flu?
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.960]  Can you bury a half million from flu here? There it is. Plans for mass graves confirmed,
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.520]  government survey, cemetery readiness for flu outbreak. And guys, scroll down and click on
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.000]  the actual documents for prisonplanet.tv viewers. If you're a radio listener, you can just search
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.080]  engine that term. Division of cemeteries. Okay, I was calling it bureau going from memory. State of
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:24.640]  New York department of division of cemeteries. Okay, so that's preparing for mass flu outbreaks
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:31.600]  and mass death. Okay. And then I off air talked to sources in several other states confirming
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:37.360]  they'd received these letters in 2007, eight and nine, but in nine, they told them we are
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.800]  going to have this. This is going to happen. Flu will break out this year. Now this is much
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.520]  before this novel flu out of left field just shows up and pops up. Okay.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:57.040]  Now I said on air, I said, I don't know if this is going to be a real outbreak. I don't know how
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:03.280]  deadly it's going to be. But in the training they're doing with local police, they're having them
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:09.680]  harden their police stations, harden their sheriff's departments, harden their emergency
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:16.160]  management centers and fire departments for IED attacks and terror attacks. Now, why would small
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.120]  towns be needing to do this? Well, this is a society completely collapses, which the banks
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:26.000]  have done by design. 90% of people were self-sufficient in the Great Depression. At least seven million
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.040]  starved to death conservatively in university studies over that decade. Now 90% are urban,
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.720]  less than less than the 10% than a rural around half of those are self-sufficient.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:42.640]  So we had millions starving to death and dying and grapes of wrath with 90% self-sufficient.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.600]  Now with 90 plus percent that aren't self-sufficient, what's going to happen? You understand what's
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:53.200]  being set up here. Now this is being looked at. This is a current battle plan they've got,
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:16:00.240]  but that doesn't mean this will be implemented. And I said they're using this flu as a martial law
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:07.440]  takeover screen, as a martial law template, rationalization, a cover story, an excuse.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.680]  I've learned how they operate. And then when the flu popped up, we said, we don't know if this is
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.240]  going to be deadly or not, but they went in and told doctors nationwide and state emergency managers
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.400]  that it was going to be all these hundreds of thousands dead and was going to be martial law
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:26.800]  to further hype the fear in April. But because we exposed the fact that it was a manufactured flu,
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:32.160]  because we, because we pointed out that the people were not really getting sick and this was
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.720]  manufactured hype, because we pointed out the fact that most people dying had already had the
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:41.280]  regular seasonal flu shot and that that was what was killing them, because that information
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:48.320]  got out. They had to back off the program and didn't go ahead with it. Now, if you analyze this oil
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:55.200]  spill and the way they gave orders to the well operators that they knew would cause it to come
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:00.640]  in early and fail and the way they block the response in the Gulf the last 83 days, now 84
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:08.080]  days today, and the way they wouldn't let locals deal with it and the way that they've been blocking
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:15.520]  any coverage of it. And now the intel is flooding in from Marines and Army people that indeed this
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:24.800]  is true and that martial law is being prepared in the Gulf States. And then that will be the
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:30.800]  perfect cover story with this hysteria, with this breakdown of society going into the November
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:36.160]  election for Obama to make everybody forget about government takeover of health care and
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.880]  forget about the Arizona situation and forget about everything that's happening and so they
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:46.720]  can launch a war with Iran so they could perhaps even suspend the election or use it as a smoke
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:51.680]  screen to divert people during the election if they use the electronic voting machines in
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:57.840]  nationwide that have been proven to be fraudulent. But if we get the word out about what's happening
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.080]  there's a good chance they may back off because they're listening with the NSA. They're tracking
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.400]  what citizens are saying and doing. They know if the public's going to buy into something or not.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.400]  So clearly this is a staged event in the Gulf. Clearly the martial law is already in effect
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:17.600]  there. The Washington Post and others are talking about forced mass evacuations. Now Joe you got a
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:21.280]  minute and a half we're going to come back with our calls but finish up any other points that
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:27.520]  this source told you. The only other thing they said Alex was like every one of these facilities
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:33.920]  in these stadiums would be they would be tents would be in there they would have medical facilities
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:42.720]  inside of medical tents inside the the stadiums and that what what started the whole conversation
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:49.920]  with this veteran fellow veteran Alex was he said that they've got martial law in Iraq and he said
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:54.000]  just like they're going to do here and I said well what do you mean and that's when he told me
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:01.280]  about his fellow army buddy that had he had talked to that stated this to them and they
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:08.960]  would be they are on standby right now and that they would be having live ammunition on
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:14.720]  and that's what and what concerns me Alex is that it's uh I'm looking at this whole old thing
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:21.760]  as a big front just like you do and I don't think you're a psychic Alex but I will say this brother
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:27.840]  you do have spiritual discernment and I'm grateful for that brother and and that's about
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:34.160]  really all the man had told me but he lives in San Antonio Texas his name is Greg and he did state
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:39.360]  this to me because uh and it has me concerned because I don't think it's over the old spell Alex
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:46.960]  well that's that's amazing and he told me to tell my sister she better go ahead and sell her house
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:58.880]  in Beaumont Texas amazing well again they may just be using this hype I'll explain when we come

[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:31.920]  people are about to attack you during a flu collapse in the months before they launched the fake
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:38.560]  flu attack out of mexico last year they may not declare martial law with the troops or they may
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:46.400]  not actively implement it in a wider area right now it's just on the coastline and it is martial
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:51.680]  law when they come up and tell you don't videotape police don't videotape national guard don't videotape
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.200]  the relief effort that is the first amendment being suspended that's the heart of martial law
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.640]  they may just use all this fear in the gulf to artificially drive down property values they may
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:10.160]  use it as a pretext to have a military presence there or they may be going for martial law as
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:16.240]  the gulf being the kickoff during a financial collapse and blame the financial collapse on
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:22.400]  the gulf it's certainly a contributing factor but it's almost like just a complication infection
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:30.480]  from the main disease now i'm going to talk to redneck vick jg angie and david but then when
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:35.680]  those calls are gone because we got peter shift coming up we're almost out of time as soon as these
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:39.600]  callers are gone or as soon as i hang up on each caller it's your chance if you're in the military
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:45.280]  but you do need to call from a pay phone uh or you need to call or if you're out of the military
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:52.000]  and just got out you can do it uh or you can call from skype uh i guess we should just get past the
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.080]  fear i'm just saying that they are listening to everything that's admitted and a lot of people
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:01.040]  are scared to call i've been told that on the street by military uh but are you being told
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.440]  you're preparing for martial law we've gotten so much intel with the people's names and the rest of
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:10.720]  it but they say we can't use their names uh but but i would specifically like to hear from you
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:17.440]  about if you're being trained for martial law in the gulf we know snipers we know civil unrest
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:25.120]  mps are being sent to the gulf that's confirmed but i'd like to get your calls on that 800-259-9231
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:32.400]  so when i finish up with these five callers uh we're going to leave the phones open for military
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:37.840]  only uh or police who've got any intel on this they're keeping it highly compartmentalized but
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:43.040]  this is important and this may be the crisis that the obama handlers are going to use because
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:50.240]  their entire agenda is collapsing and so they may use a new war martial law you name it stage terror
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:55.520]  attacks as a pretext to keep their agenda going uh let's talk to redneck in mississippi go ahead
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.720]  redneck hey what's going on mr jones how you doing this afternoon good worldwide broadcast what's on
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:06.480]  your mind well i tell you i got a little solution that people can think into as far as uh how this
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.840]  economy is going in the down spiral here um old technology called gasification have you ever
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:18.320]  heard about it or familiar with it yes but why don't you fill us in all right well i know back
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:24.400]  in world war two europe was basically a wood gas fired uh area of the world you know because the
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:33.600]  oil shortage is whatnot and basically it's uh very simple is uh you pyro you threw pyrolysis
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.720]  without actually burning the wood you actually heat it up and draw off carbon monoxide
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:46.240]  methane hydrogens stuff like that and you can use that gas on internal combustion engines uh
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:54.640]  uh heating boilers well sir i mean they could make fuel for cars out of coal there's there's so many
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:59.440]  resources it's ridiculous but the washington post is talking about banning air conditioners
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:05.840]  here's the headline in the heat wave the case against air conditioning this is the globalist
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:11.680]  seizing all forms of energy and making it illegal for you to be self-sufficient this is siege but i
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:17.200]  appreciate your call redneck yes there are many ways for us to power our society and all of it

[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:26.400]  and they're going to use this oil spill to try to nationalize the oil companies

[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:31.040]  and understanding that this radio show in our work is a major affront to their operations
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:35.280]  and they've not wanted to kill me in the past because they don't want to underline my work
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:40.880]  they don't want to highlight it like that they understand that i'm becoming more focused and
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:46.080]  that my analysis is really having a big effect and that i think we're all entering a danger zone so
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:53.600]  your prayers are needed but whatever god's will is that will be what happens we're on the march

[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:26.720]  martial law but anybody who's carried out in iraq or other areas knows what it is it's just you
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:33.360]  have no rights you're in a total police state that's what martial law is and the greatest extension
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:37.600]  of that is don't come outside your doors and the secret police going around and arresting
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:42.160]  people and putting bags over their heads and whether it's england canada or the united states
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:47.120]  every time they have an urban warfare drill uh or a special event like g20 they actually have
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:52.960]  private security people in plain clothes in front of news cameras grabbing people putting bags over
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:57.120]  their heads and putting them in vehicles and they're doing that just to acclimate you do yeah
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:01.600]  i've seen that on the news what's the big deal private people putting bags over your heads

[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.840]  and again that's starting to come out in the news they may do this when the oil comes ashore
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:30.560]  but the oil is going to come in in waves not all at once it can be cleaned up if they let
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:35.760]  them clean it up i don't think an evacuation is needed maybe a few miles inland but you know
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:42.000]  they're going to use this crisis to the maximum effect now let's go ahead and go to uh jg in
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.360]  california you're on the air oh good morning alex uh some of my background has been in federal
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:52.400]  law enforcement you know alex and in years past we never had heard any idea of this kind of trees
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:58.720]  and you know being peddled amongst federal or military and some but some of my colleagues years

[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:10.240]  down there you know cubans and chinese looking like military troops but i just can't believe
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:16.160]  that you're saying already that the marines alex are the marines in california resting gun owners
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.880]  carrying it unloaded safely which is legal in california uh carrying in their trunks
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:29.280]  yes sir we have confirmed nationwide that police military national guard and i've got newscast
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:37.040]  from fox in in in uh new york state where they are running cars through an x-ray machine going
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:43.200]  oh look we got a rifle we're going to make a rest absolutely they are i mean you see it in the news
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:48.480]  all the time where somebody carries a deer rifle out of their car the police get called the police
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:53.360]  arrest them because they find 10 guns in their garage that are legal i mean this is this is
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:59.840]  going on constantly i've got video of them arresting people for a pocket constitution i've heard you
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:06.000]  talk about these things but you know the the fact that you know like i myself alex i i call ahead
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.880]  you know to the state that i may travel through that i don't have a ccw and call ahead how to
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:16.880]  carry the weapon legally and for the last 10 years i've had no problem but this this lately uh you
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:22.160]  know like i'm near vegas now okay have you heard anything any problems in nevada and uh eastern
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:28.080]  california where uh citizens are carrying weapons are the marines in their fort urwin and uh 29
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:35.760]  poms doing this yes they're arresting citizens yeah let me uh show you in fact guys can i have a
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:41.120]  document cam shot please yeah let me just show you a state highway patrol press release even if
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.960]  you're listening on the radio you can watch this at prism planet dot tv chip news and then when you
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:53.200]  read the chip news uh it says they're running dw i checkpoints and they're armed and they search
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:37:00.480]  the vehicles and yes they are uh in these reports harassing gun owners uh and if they decide that
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:05.120]  you've got a gun that they think might be illegal they go ahead and just take you on into jail so
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:11.280]  yes they are training also for gun confiscation i mean i had a kernel on last year in arcadia
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:15.920]  iowa where they were doing gun confiscation drills in the town but but the point is just
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:22.160]  having marines at checkpoints for dwis against citizens that is illegal and then here is the
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:30.000]  news articles from fox news and out of nbc la cop show marines how to take on taliban
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.480]  but then when you read deeper into this and we have reports of this confirmed two years ago
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:39.680]  they're engaged in law enforcement action with the police so they're openly merging them now sir
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:44.000]  yeah well those citizens that are carrying them legally alex i don't see how they can take it
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.240]  upon themselves i mean i hear you talk about the cops in southern texas and you know i can
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:53.120]  understand that down there with those kind of cops but the northeast and and you know in the west
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:58.160]  in the west coast i haven't ever heard of such tyranny and parasitic you know trampling on our
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:02.720]  what did you hear about the woman the housewife no criminal record they reported she was my
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:07.200]  i've got glenn beckon alex jones listener she got pulled over with a rifle in her trunk and they
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:15.120]  went ahead and arrested her and are investigating her for terrorism i wasn't loaded no yeah yeah
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.960]  i'm believing all this alex coming out of you and a couple other of my colleagues uh i mean
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:27.760]  no i mean look look look sir sir i remember law enforcement technology magazine five or six years
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.560]  ago said officer if you see someone with a get us out of the un sticker on their car
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:39.360]  and you can go pull this up i'm paraphrasing but it said go ahead and arrest them and police chiefs
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:42.240]  don't get mad at your officers you need to go ahead and bring these people in
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.320]  and interrogate them because they might be terrorist i mean have you seen the mayak
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:50.400]  and homeland security report where they tell the police the number one threat is returning veterans
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:55.760]  with guns i'm a veteran alex but no but what i'm saying is i mean this is what they're being
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:03.200]  trained yes it's illegal yes it's unlawful it's illegal to have troops of the kentucky derby
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:09.680]  arresting people they're just acclimating everyone i appreciate your call i mean it's illegal
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:13.520]  that they blocked food and water for five days wouldn't let the national guard bring the food
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:18.000]  into the super dome people set up for five days begging for it through the barbed wire but then
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.560]  they sent them into the dry areas into wealthy homes and took their guns i mean that really happened
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.760]  this is what the military is training to do this is what's happening let's go ahead and take another
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:34.560]  call i appreciate your call uh angie in texas you're on the air hi i live here in brownsville
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:39.600]  yes and i wanted to let you know a couple of things that went on during hurricane alex
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:48.240]  the first thing was that there was a newscast report saying how you know how they're gonna
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:54.720]  process people into the shelters and i said oh my gosh because i thought back to your commercial
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:02.400]  about the bracelets and it popped up again right now they were showing how they process people
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:09.040]  how they give them the bracelets and how they have to give them certain information um then they
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:16.320]  give them these yellow bracelets that they can scan yes man and again each time it gets more
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:22.320]  extreme it's because they know it's hard to beat incrementalism and they then put people in these
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:28.720]  camps and you're not allowed to go out at night and sometimes they'll break up families and bust
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:34.960]  different people to different areas the cps is there uh you're looking for bruises on your children
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:40.240]  to try to take them this is what goes on it's just incrementally they're ratcheting it up
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:46.080]  take the public schools warrantless checkpoints id cards thumb printing to get school lunches to
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:51.920]  get library books being trained to tattle on their parents we're all being immersed in classical
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:59.600]  authoritarianism yes exactly and um down here i mean last night and my husband were driving home
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:06.960]  and it was just amazing i have never seen that many state troopers and cops all over the expressway
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:12.640]  all over the road it was just like wow what's going on is there anything special going on here
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:17.760]  they tripled the number of police in the last 15 years and they've basically federalized them
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:23.520]  and it's we're in a lot of trouble and i see reports every few days where they'll lay off half
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.160]  or more of sheriff's deputies or police and then they're in the news saying and the officers we've
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:33.040]  got are for revenue generation we're not going to respond to most crime you better buy a gun
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:38.960]  which is actually an honest statement uh but uh i mean this country is going into a full collapse
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:44.240]  by design and the feds are going to try to use the collapse for a total takeover i appreciate your
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:51.760]  call uh let's talk to anonymous who is us military and now again i'm only taking calls till we go to
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:59.920]  break and until peter schiff comes on in about 25 minutes specifically specifically for military
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.960]  or police they're not going to march in is that we're getting ready for martial law it's like
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:09.040]  this is a security situation in the gulf we are preparing for uh massive evacuations if the main
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:15.760]  oil comes ashore most of its offshore 99 they estimate of 150 plus that number two weeks old
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:21.280]  god knows what it is it's hundreds of millions of gallons it's it's off-gassing benzene other
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:27.200]  toxic chemicals uh methane gas you know if this comes ashore we may have a crisis so we're gearing
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:34.080]  up for that so you know prepare to have a lockdown situation what is your intel on this let's talk to
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:41.600]  anonymous us military give us your take well yes sir okay um i just want to first say i'm
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:48.000]  had a little risk talking here but uh first i just want to ask you something about uh
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:53.040]  that have you heard of the society called the oath keepers yes of course we've heard about
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:59.040]  oath keepers yes sir and do you believe that's a good organization and like constitutional soldiers
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:05.600]  willing to to separate from tyrannical yes sir we were the first major radio show to interview
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.880]  oath keepers i've made a mini documentary about it steward roads i mean their code of conduct is
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:14.960]  just simply the constitution the bill of rights what you sworn an oath to so i think it's a good
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:23.360]  organization okay well that i i own i'm currently trying to get into a membership with them well
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:30.640]  listen most people aren't members it's just a code for people to go look at uh and so again that's a
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:35.840]  separate issue but but uh you're in the military do you have any information about marshal law in
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:42.800]  the gulf not in the gulf necessarily but as i'm speaking i know someone who is training right
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:49.280]  now a friend of mine who's also in the military and uh i have this website that you can go to
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:54.720]  and you think they're overly training with police and they have pictures and videos of firemen and
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:00.560]  police and national guardsmen training together can you write it down are you ready yes sir i mean
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:05.200]  i've been to literally dozens of these events i'm i'm fully aware of that uh but go ahead and give
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:19.840]  it to us okay it's m utc dot i n dot ng so that a little bit slower okay m utc dot i n dot ng dot
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:25.920]  m i l well the best thing for you to do sir is give me the headline on the first article
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:32.880]  that's the best way to search is not long URLs okay okay us army north analysis field training
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:39.760]  exercise vibrant response 10.2 oh absolutely i'm aware of that yes that's that's brigade homeland
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:46.240]  that they want to get up to 400 000 troops strength by 2011 it's reportedly over 100 000 domestic
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:51.200]  operatives right now and that's just the public intel we are the enemy the american people are the
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:56.320]  enemy so we're never given the full picture neither are the troops uh but they say it's over 100 000
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:01.200]  right now yes sir i'm aware and there's photos on the on those sites of of citizens with their
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:09.120]  hands behind their heads with troops aiming m16s at them yes yes yes sir i am aware uh of that
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:15.040]  so what does your associate who's training in this tell you it's four uh well he's in a command
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:19.440]  position i'm not going to reveal his name or rank yeah don't do that just just give us the info
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:29.840]  well they're training it in a sense to just just be able to disable eyes gun owners and people who
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:38.560]  people who are declared unlawful and are really not in the sense yeah and by disable or neutralize
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:45.120]  that means uh lining up against the wall and shoot you yeah by the way i have this on video
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:49.920]  they wouldn't let me into a certain marine corps training drill in urban warrior they kept keeping
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:55.600]  me away but we were able to slip uh someone in as a quote tourist because they were allowing
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:00.240]  citizens to have tours and the marines were practicing putting citizens on their knees
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.800]  and shooting them in the back of the head and that's in police state 2000 they said hey now
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:10.080]  you're going to get to see an execution and the marine says don't tape this and they practice taking
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.000]  the people out of their apartment setting them down on their knees and shooting them right in the
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.120]  back of the head and so your your friend says that he's part of this training as we speak right now
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:26.560]  he's in indiana training oh india is the main epicenter i tell you we get so many intel hits on
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:33.200]  that that are confirmed it is bad news because they think illinois is going to flee i really and the
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:37.920]  cfr said this too and they like to brag about what they're planning they said chicago is the next big
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.920]  main nuke target because i don't know the bankers want to nuke themselves even with small nuke in
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:48.560]  new york but chicago um and let me tell you that's in the car it's anything else uh i just want to
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:55.280]  say that that to anyone listening that these the military people who you see running these check
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:00.160]  points in california they're they're just following orders they're not they're not necessarily think
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:05.760]  what they're doing is necessarily right and if it's training they don't understand that
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:12.560]  that a lot of young privates don't understand the big picture of things that are going on and how
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:17.840]  this could change the way they're their neighbors and they're everybody around them well the point
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:23.200]  is is that america has been overthrown by foreign banks it wasn't the russians it wasn't the chai
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:27.120]  comms though the globalists used china to deindustrialize us they're part of the globalist team
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:32.240]  we've been overthrown and now they're about to come take everything and shut our industry completely
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:38.240]  off to break us to to make us slaves i mean that's their own statements the end of the industrialized
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:44.160]  society we're going into bondage just like israel every time they became evil you know god sent
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:49.680]  them into bondage foreign captivity and uh this is what happens to every country rome became decadent
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.720]  and fell heaven help us i appreciate your call i remember talking to the marine court commander
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:48:05.600]  in fact his names in this chips press release uh but uh it says the
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:10.240]  basin office of the california highway patrol chip in conjunction with the san bernadino county
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:15.600]  sheriff's department and the usmc military police will conduct a joint sobriety driver's checkpoint
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:21.120]  on friday december 12 2008 this is just one of them and it was just dozens of these and i called
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:26.720]  and talked to the commander the guy that was over this and he knew exactly who i was he was real arrogant
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:30.560]  and he's like we're stopping drugs what's your problem with that and i was like well why don't
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:34.080]  you just i should have recorded it but i said well why don't you just come on and tell us how
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:39.520]  this is good i don't have time for this i'm not coming on your show and i know who you are
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:47.680]  you know you need to be pro-military we're working hard you know the red coats in 1775 act in the
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:52.160]  same way you know when the british citizens were saying we're calling us but we have the same rights
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:55.920]  you're taking our freedoms you're pushing us around you're confiscating our guns
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:02.640]  shut up you traitor i'm just doing my job all right do we have any other military people that
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:12.880]  want to comment on this 800 259 9231 what john i'm leaving the phones wide open 1 800 259 9231
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:20.080]  are we men or are we mice i mean are we so afraid as military people so that's why they kind of
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.000]  admit the nsa's listening to everything now that we're being tracked and they let the troops know
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.960]  everything you do talking to your families being recorded and then that gets nsa people used to just
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:35.520]  listening to people without warrants you know the same way they bathe the military and tyranny and
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:40.160]  the police and tyranny they bathe us they wash our minds that's what brainwashing is they wash
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:47.280]  out what was there your old morals and they give you new ones but they can't stop us all i mean okay

[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:23.200]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:33.760]  well ladies and gentlemen we are into this third hour of worldwide broadcast senatorial candidate
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:40.640]  peter chef will be joining us we're gonna open the phones up if you'd like to talk to him 800
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:49.200]  259 9231 uh look at this asa cola headline i hope i'm pronouncing that right out of
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:59.040]  iowa this is out of the sue journal sue city journal federal judge orders county sheriff to
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:04.400]  issue gun permit and the article is incredible to paraphrase it in the interest of time this person
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:09.280]  wrote a letter to the editor critical of the government and critical of the sheriff's anti
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:16.080]  gun stance so the sheriff told him in the town you are banned from getting a gun permit and see
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:21.680]  that's your new gun right folks is you go get a permit from the government and then they deny it
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:27.200]  if they want that's based with the supreme court ruling is said but a lower level federal court
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:33.520]  has ordered a us district judge walter w bennett has ordered the county sheriff douglas l webber
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:37.760]  to issue a gun permit to a resident and to complete a college level courts involving the first
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:46.240]  amendment the court finds a tsunami a maelstrom of avalanche of direct uncontroverted evidence
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:51.680]  in sheriff webber's own testimony conclude beyond all doubt that he unquestionably violated the
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:58.800]  first amendment right of at least paul door bennett wrote in his ruling and uh he told him
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:11.680]  because he protested once and sent a letter to the editor that uh the um he called the uh gun
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:19.760]  owner a wacko delusional a nut job a spook and a narcissist and just said i don't allow you to own
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:25.600]  a gun this is the government being god you can't have prior restraint when somebody commits a crime
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:32.560]  with a gun then they're held accountable i mean that's the essence of freedom we've seen chicago
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:37.520]  we've seen new york we know where they ban guns crime rates explode and i've gone over the new
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:44.320]  chicago gun law it's basically impossible to get a gun and uh they're calling it uh your privilege
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:51.120]  and that they're permitting you to have a gun uh that mafia runs city uh but overall i guess the
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:58.160]  ruling's good and then it does say that at least there is some right to own firearms uh in this
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:05.040]  country shifting gears into another subject governor's voice grave concerns over immigration
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:09.280]  new york times in a private meeting with white house officials this weekend democratic governor's
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.600]  voice deep anxiety about the obon administration suiting against terra zone is new immigration law
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.680]  and this is really galvanized people like nothing i've seen worrying that it could cost a valuable
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:25.760]  democrat party that could cost a vulnerable democratic party in the fall elections while the
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:30.320]  weak economy dominated the official agenda at the summer meeting here on the national governor's
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:37.120]  association concern over immigration policy uh pervaded the closed-door session about democratic
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:41.440]  governors and white house officials and simmered throughout the three-day event because the states
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:45.920]  know they're going bankrupt they know there's a crime spree by illegal aliens they know mexico's
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:50.480]  imploded into crime and lawlessness and they know that it's democratic voters that are upset as well
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:58.160]  but what does the white house say oh well they're going to sue on racial profiling issues even
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:04.000]  the law doesn't say racial profiling it says after first contact for suspicion of another crime drunk
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.400]  driving speeding whatever it is if you don't have an id and you're an illegal alien they're
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:13.360]  going to rush you for that too now that's what the stinking bell says not what the media hoax says
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:17.840]  just like they have a media hoax saying you're a racist if you're against government run health
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:23.920]  care what does that have to do with it nothing holder floats possibility of racial profiling suit
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:31.680]  on top of the new suit us might launch second suit against arizona immigration law holder says
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:36.320]  this is only illustrating to everybody that we have a government involved in high treason
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:41.520]  against the republic and they are not going to get away with it and that is such exciting news
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:45.920]  that they're being forced to come out in the open and show everybody just how treacherous
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:50.160]  and unamerican and hateful they are our federal government is run by globalist
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:55.520]  it is a corporate takeover they use the united states like a throwaway whore it's that simple

[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:10.160]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:15.200]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:20.800]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:25.920]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:31.200]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:35.840]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:41.200]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and

[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:18.400]  network
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:36.480]  ladies and gentlemen we are back alive and peter schiff running for the u.s senate
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:41.920]  uh is our guest of course is a businessman financial commentator economic advisor to
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:47.840]  ron paul's 2008 presidential campaign and uh 2010 candidate uh for the united states senate
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:51.280]  in the state of connecticut and peter schiff it's good to have you here with us for the
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:56.880]  balance of the hour thanks alex for having me on well so much has happened so much has uh
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:02.240]  developed in the last eight nine months since we last had you on uh before we get into your
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:07.680]  run for the senate uh as a guy who's you know predicted what would happen in the economy
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:13.680]  breakdown what what you see happening well unfortunately the politicians who poisoned
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:20.480]  the well with their subsidies and regulations and cheap money the government stimulus is simply
[02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:25.200]  more of the problem you know we got into this economic mess because we stimulated the economy
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:30.560]  with low interest rates and government guarantees uh uh consumers spend too much money because of
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:34.800]  government subsidies we bought houses and cars that we couldn't afford we imported products that
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:39.360]  we couldn't afford uh the government spent money it didn't have that's how we dug our way into
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:44.320]  this hole and now they're threatening to turn it into the grand canyon of holes uh you know they're
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:48.800]  trying to restimulate the problem and they are succeeding we're now deeper into debt than we
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:54.160]  were before the government is much larger than it was it's distorting the economy with even more
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:59.520]  regulations we've given the fed more power we've given fha more power the fanny and freddy more
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:05.920]  power uh we are in doctrine or you know enshrining future bailouts into law now instead of admitting
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:10.960]  we shouldn't have bailed out anybody now we're committing future taxpayers to endless uh a wall
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:17.120]  street bailouts we've done everything wrong and i think we're now catering on the brink of a depression
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:21.200]  not because the government didn't do it not but because it did too much i think it's going to be
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:26.240]  an inflationary depression and i you know i want to be in washington to put an end to it before it's
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:35.040]  too late well i mean peter uh ron paul myself many others get called conspiracy theorists when
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:40.640]  we read imf world bank plans going back 20 years to establish a global currency where this private
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:45.840]  group of banks set uh you know the value of currencies worldwide where we pay carbon taxes
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:51.520]  to them now that's all out in the open and the very same big central banks and the very same
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:57.360]  governments that have bankrupted our economy that have created 600 trillion or more in fraudulent
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:02.640]  derivatives they're now saying we've got to raise all these taxes the imf saying we've got to raise
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:08.240]  the income tax they're saying we've got to have a value added tax we've got to cut social security
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:13.120]  we don't need to cut any of that if we just cut government you know spending and bailouts to
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:18.960]  bankers but my issue is the budget gets bigger but then we've got to supposedly have austerity
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:24.400]  at the same time i don't think that our leaders are smart enough to have conspired to cause this
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:29.040]  i think it's their own incompetence that did it and their own uh you know all they care about
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:33.760]  is their own reelection and so to further their own political campaigns uh careers they do things
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:37.760]  they're detrimental to the country but they certainly take advantage of a crisis even if
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:42.000]  they're the ones that caused it so i know that brock obama and his buddies in washington are a
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.200]  bunch of socialists they don't think the market works anyway and when their policies destroy it
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:51.440]  you know they take credit they basically say it's the free it's capitalism doesn't work its freedom
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:56.240]  it doesn't work and the solution is more government so they certainly don't waste the crisis it's like
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:01.520]  they set a fire and then they go to put it out with gasoline and when it gets bigger they take
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:06.400]  credit for trying to put it out but then they pour more gasoline on it so it's great for them
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:11.520]  because it means more government your bureaucracy we surrender more of our liberties the weaker the
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:16.400]  economy gets the more poverty government creates the bigger the role for government in their eyes
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.360]  and the only way that we can end this cycle is to someone to go to washington and take away the
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:27.360]  gasoline and let's you know and then the fire can go out well peter uh you know i agree with you on
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:32.800]  that point but i mean there is some organization to this we see the timber wool females where
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:38.000]  they're saying this stuff is crap but let's sell it to our customers and then we'll make money on
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:44.080]  both sides of it we see uh rama manual saying don't let a good crisis uh go to waste we know
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:49.280]  washington wants to bankrupt the states so they can just further federalize them i mean they know
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:53.680]  that's what they're doing with health care i mean they have set up this new obama care
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:58.640]  basically what is this is going to do ultimately is destroy private health care is going to destroy
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:02.560]  the insurance industry because it can't work and then when the whole thing falls apart
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:07.200]  they're going to say you see we need to we need a single payer plan i mean the government gets in
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:12.080]  and creates the problem it's death and a fail it's like the camels nose under the tent and that's
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:19.040]  what this thing is it's a camels nose of socialized medicine well sure and then they screw up health
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:23.280]  care even more and their answer is more government to fix it right of course the only reason that
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:27.760]  health care is so expensive is because of all the government involvement if we actually had
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:33.760]  a free market in health care the way we do in let's say cell phones or laptop computers or
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:38.000]  stuff like that if we had a free market with market forces and competition and the federal
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.560]  government stayed out of it you know health care would be getting less expensive every year we would
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:47.760]  even have a health care crisis just like we don't have crisis in computers you know they would be
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:52.400]  getting less expensive people would have more health care for less it'd be great but the government
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.520]  comes in with their subsidies and their mandates and their rules and regulations and it prevents
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:02.800]  the free market from working so instead of market forces bringing prices down you have government
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:10.560]  bureaucracy forcing prices up well peter look at obama he got conservatively four times the
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:17.600]  wall street money john mccain did wall street has gotten trillions of dollars in the aggregate out
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:24.480]  of these bailouts from that and you know my whole issue is a lot of the interest on wall street
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:29.360]  want crony capitalism they want to deal with the government so when people say obama is a
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:35.840]  socialist i agree that you know his wife and hillary and all these people and kagan wrote their
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:41.680]  thesis on socialism and and they themselves are socialist but the big banks and the big you know
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:47.600]  monopoly men they want a socialist model to socialize our wealth and give it to them wall street
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:52.480]  is not just monolithic i mean i am part of wall street and i didn't want a single bailout i wanted
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:57.040]  those firms to fail there are a lot of smaller firms that are not politically connected that
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:01.920]  don't benefit from the bailouts and the large rest but you have a handful of large firms
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:06.640]  that basically have bought their way into the government and i blame the government more than
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:11.280]  i blame uh the businesses i mean yes they're trying to make a buck and the fact that we have a corrupt
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:15.920]  government that they can bribe uh you know it's the fault of the no i totally agree with you i
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:22.000]  totally agree with you corporate corruption needs a big government to give them government power
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:28.080]  to engage in market rigging and oligopoly if we if we take away the power from the bureaucrats then
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:32.160]  there's no reason to try to bribe them because they have nothing to give you and you've got this
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:37.120]  conspiracy i don't want it's not really a conspiracy but it's a cooperation between big
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:42.000]  government and wall street and it's bleeding the country dry and it's got an end and it starts with
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.440]  the federal reserve the federal service is feeding these companies cheap money uh they make riskless
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:52.240]  profits you've got government backstopping everything so when they can make all these risky
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:57.680]  bets and when the bets pay off they win and when the bets lose they win again because we bail them
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:02.080]  out that is the problem and it's not going to stop until we change the players in washington
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:07.040]  until we send a senator there they can't be bought and we're going to talk about your campaign and
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:11.920]  how people can get involved in that uh here in a moment but but going back to this for a minute
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:17.920]  uh i mean i totally agree with you government is the main vector government is what allows
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:23.920]  this to happen my only issue is i found with the left if you go out and explain to them
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:29.440]  that the health care plan was written by a consortium of insurance companies to lower care
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:35.440]  and raise taxes and ensure that 30 something million people had to buy overpriced cruddy care
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:40.560]  from their plans i mean the left is now actually starting to discover that i'm seeing them go what
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:45.280]  i don't get a free lunch i don't get some free health care this doesn't cover pre-existing conditions
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:50.160]  this does set up these federal panels that cut the quality of care i mean that do lead to death
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:55.520]  panels i mean i just see it when we approach it from the classic libertarian perspective
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:17:00.560]  it doesn't seem to telegraph through because it's so nuanced i mean here's another example yeah i mean
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:06.160]  here you've got an industry that is now through government force compelling people to buy their
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:12.000]  products whether they want them or not i mean what the beauty of the free market is a business
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:17.040]  has to win me as a customer i have to voluntarily buy their product which means i have to want it
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:20.640]  i have to think it's better than the competition now you have the government saying that you've got
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:27.600]  no choice you've got to buy this no matter how crappy it is you know all right now now i i i want
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:32.080]  to get into your campaign and get your stance on issues for listeners out there so they know
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:36.720]  where you come from because most people know who you are but some may not but but going back to the
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:42.640]  banking reform bill even the head of the texas banking association uh wrote a story a few months
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:47.680]  ago breaking it down he said the big mega banks that created the derivatives that have a sweetheart
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:51.920]  deal with the government who have almost every regulatory position they have written this to
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:57.760]  shut us down and take us over and take down smaller wall street firms ron paul concurred here
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:02.560]  two weeks ago on the show saying that's exactly what it does but the media is running a hoax
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:07.600]  saying oh this banking reform bill it's going to get jp morgan chase and goldman sacks what's
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:11.440]  your take on that absolutely not i mean there's no way that's gonna happen i mean i know that
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:16.560]  whenever wall street screws up and they get their buddies in government to write regulations it punishes
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:22.400]  the smaller firms that compete with them you see these big firms like goldman sacks or jp morgan
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:26.480]  they have economies of scale they don't care how much rules and regulations they have an army of
[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:31.600]  lawyers on staff they got you know they can handle it it's little firms like me you know my compliance
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:36.800]  costs have gone through the roof i now have an eight person compliance department whereas 10 years
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:42.080]  ago i did it all myself you know and and i'm spending millions of dollars a year on compliance it is
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:47.120]  worthless the tatured act has killed me the anti-money lottery stuff this you know it is i've now
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:52.480]  been turned into an untate irs informant spying on all my customers it costs me a fortune to do it
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:56.480]  and i hate to do it but if i don't do it they're gonna shut me down like i can't even be in business
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:01.360]  anymore but all the stuff that happened in the in the nasdaq bubble the sarbanes oxley the rules
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:06.880]  that we got after i didn't participate in any of those problems yet i had to bear the the costs
[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:12.160]  of all the the screw-ups and the big firms that's what's gonna happen again all this is gonna do is
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:18.320]  add more unnecessary rules and regulations that add costs that put up barriers and it's all gonna be
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:23.200]  selectively enforced because the big six banks literally have all the regulators oh yeah as their
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:28.400]  former alumni in their back pocket just like marnie marnie made off did i mean you know i mean you
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:32.160]  had all these guys bought off he married off it you know that his daughter went to one of the
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:37.040]  regulators and they bribed these guys but yeah i mean a lot of firms aren't gonna get started a
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:42.240]  lot of smaller firms are gonna go out of business because they can't survive the regulatory onslaught
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:46.560]  and all of this is music to the ears of these big too big to fail firms that are gonna get a lot
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:51.280]  bigger and make a lot more money off the backs of the american people yeah this is veritas that's
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:56.000]  the heart of it and you explain that to some socialist liberal they'll actually understand that
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:20:01.040]  we'll be right back with peter ship our guest running for senate in canada can stay with us

[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:25.360]  campaign on the economy and he of course predicted a lot of what has now unfolded i want him before he
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:31.200]  leaves us then in the 35 minutes left with him uh get back into how he sees uh the situation with
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:35.520]  the uh with the economy unraveling i mean they're now starting to admit we're in a depression
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:40.960]  not just a double dip recession so we'll get his uh take on that in fact let's just get your take
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:45.680]  more on the economy right now because that's what you're really an expert on uh where do you see
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:50.240]  things going i mean they're now not just calling it a double dip recession well i've been calling it
[02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:54.880]  a depression since it began and it's going to be an inflationary depression that's going to make it
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:25:00.960]  that much more depressing for for most americans and it's not because of reasons but paul corgman
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:05.120]  is saying he says we're going to have a depression because the government isn't doing enough it's
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:09.200]  it's that it's doing too much that's what we're going to have a depression the government is
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:14.160]  starving the economy of the resources that it needs to grow and produce and provide employment
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:19.520]  opportunities you see we can't try to return to the ways things were while the bubble was inflating
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:25.520]  that was the problem we have to return to an economy based on underconsumption savings
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:32.320]  production capital investment entrepreneurship um but that can't be uh you know that happened as
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:36.320]  long as the government is stimulating the government is trying to get us to spend more well we're
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:40.800]  broke you know all the stimulus is we'll get you to get americans to buy more cars we can't even
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:46.240]  afford the cars we own we have you know big buy more houses why we bought too many houses
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:49.680]  you know we're not in trouble because we didn't spend enough we're in trouble because we didn't
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:53.920]  save enough we spent too much so we've got to save our money so that businesses can invest
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:57.760]  and grow the economy but the government won't let that happen the government is borrowing
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.360]  everything you know people say the banks aren't loaning their whole they're sitting on the money
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:05.040]  they are loaning it they're loaning it to the government they're borrowing from the federal
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:09.840]  reserve and practically nothing and then buying treasuries and earning a spread on on money they
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:14.640]  don't even have but the credit is funding the growth of government which is undermining our
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:20.320]  economy it's making our economy less productive uh less able to compete it's destroying opportunities
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:26.400]  well peter peter peter i mean you say that they don't know what they're doing but when california
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:32.160]  raised taxes in the last few years and tax receipts went down that's 101 they know kennedy
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:38.640]  uh cut taxes in certain brackets up to 50 percent uh in 61 and tax receipts doubled they know carbon
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:43.840]  taxes kill jobs they know every government job takes two private sector jobs they know green
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:49.440]  jobs in spain stalled their economy so what's their answer more government more taxes well as i said
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:54.400]  before you know they do the state they the government wants to perpetuate poverty and
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:59.280]  dependency because that's how they feed uh they're like a parasite that's what they live off of our
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:04.320]  misery because if they can keep us broke then they can keep getting our votes if they can dole out
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:09.280]  money that we depend on then they can then they can have our votes because you're gonna vote against
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:14.240]  anybody who wants to take away that free lunch but the reality is without all this government
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:19.040]  help we'd all be better off it's like harry brown used to say the government is an expert at crippling
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:24.400]  you then handing you a crotch and saying see without me you couldn't walk well you did say four or five
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:28.720]  years ago we were going into a depression you did say two and a half years ago this is a depression
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:34.320]  so you've been dead on so i'm asking you sir with your own financial planning with your own research
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:39.520]  where do you see america in six months a year out two years out how bad is this depression going to
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:44.080]  get well you know right now we're still drinking the government alcohol the stimulus alcohol so
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:48.480]  for a while you know it we don't feel the ill effects of what we're doing as we go deeper into
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:52.880]  debt but i think sometime soon i don't know if it's in six months or a year or two but we're
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:57.360]  going to see a collapse in the dollar uh you know we just saw a downgrade today of us government
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:02.320]  debt by a lending by rating agencies in china we're going to start to see an aversion to us
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:06.480]  government debt around the world and the dollar is going to plunge interest rates are going to
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:11.920]  soar and then the this recession is going to kick into our depression a higher gear and at that
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:16.960]  point the government is going to be forced with a very very uncomfortable choice to create massive
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:23.200]  inflation or default on its promises and my fear is that we will choose the inflation route because
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:27.520]  it's more politically expedient and then we will have a runaway inflation we will destroy the value
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:33.280]  of our money and that we will create misery on a scale never experienced before in this country
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:37.600]  something worse than our grandparents endured during the great depression and we don't have a
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:41.200]  lot of time to head this off i mean that you know otherwise i wouldn't be running for the united
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:46.080]  states senate if i didn't think the situation with that dire believe me i there are better things i
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:52.000]  i could do with my time and then try to convince 99 you know senators uh you know to change course
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:58.480]  well i want to talk about the campaign give us some of the key dates coming up for you to be able
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:03.440]  to win the senate in connecticut well the big key date is the primary which is august 10th if i don't
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:08.000]  win the republican a primary then i'm not part of the election i'm not going to run as an independent
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:13.520]  or a libertarian i'm if i can't win the republican nomination i'm not going to run and so it's a three
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:19.120]  person race right now i'm inferred but you know i can win i mean you know if you look at the polls
[02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:24.480]  you know if you look at the polls uh my favorables are 10 times my unfavorables nobody else is close
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:28.720]  the only reason i'm not winning is because enough people don't know who i am the people who know who
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:33.600]  i am overwhelmingly support me so that's where your audience can help out there's two things that

[02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:33.520]  see anti incumbent candidates being elected everywhere winning primaries winning special
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:37.840]  elections we're going to talk about the political realignment in a moment and we'll talk about some
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:42.560]  of peter schiff's views but i wanted to hit a few headlines here this is a paul joseph watson
[02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:50.000]  story up at gcnlive.com former contractor bp not interested in cleaning up oil spill what an amazing
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:56.720]  story and we've got that video clip also posted in the article former high-level bp contractor
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:03.600]  army special uh operation soldier adam dillon told a new orleans television station that british
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:07.440]  petroleum is not interested in cleaning up oil spill because the company is run by cutthroat
[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:12.400]  individuals who only care about money and it goes on from there that's just one of the stories
[02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:19.600]  that's up at gcnlive.com another article that's up there uh dealing with the viral video i put
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:27.440]  out thursday lebron nation americans hypnotized as country collapses program zombies get hysterical
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:32.160]  about basketball while their future is being destroyed because that's what's valuable to them
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:38.400]  they know all about football basketball all about hollywood stars all about the latest controversy
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:44.720]  but nothing about what's happening uh in this nation uh so that's also up at gcnlive.com
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:50.240]  in prismplanet.com there's also been six killed four injured including the gunman after shooting
[02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:55.680]  spree and albuquerque uh company and they say it's not terror related and his wife worked there
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:35:01.120]  and he previously worked there so uh more more stress out there in society our prayers go out
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:06.960]  to those that have been killed okay peter i'd like to run through your where you stand but first
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:12.880]  off your chance of winning we've seen a lot of patriot uh type candidates come from nowhere and
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:19.680]  win uh and we see again everywhere whether it's specter uh or the person that rand paul was running
[02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:26.320]  against being a neocon or whatever we see these establishment people uh losing to patriots uh
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:33.120]  everywhere and almost every uh primary or special election we've seen so i think that's why your
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:38.000]  candidacy is extremely viable what's your view on that i think i'm i'm very viable with people
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:42.880]  know me my story is very compelling i mean if you go to the website shift for senate dot com
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:47.120]  and just watch the four-minute video who is peter ship that's on the home page
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:53.200]  because people find my story the one guy that was warning about the financial crisis on television
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:58.400]  nobody would listen to him everybody laughed at him i mean it's perfect we have an economic crisis
[02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:02.800]  on our hands yet the people who caused it are still in charge why not send one of the only people
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:08.480]  that predicted to washington my business background i mean i it makes perfect sense that's why when
[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:13.280]  people know about me they support me but that you know the republican party establishment is afraid
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:18.480]  of my winning this campaign so they're doing whatever they can to try to marginalize me to ignore me
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:23.520]  in the campaign but you know it's a small state there's only going to be about let's say a hundred
[02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:28.560]  thousand people we're going to vote in the republican primary and you know we can get to those people
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:32.400]  you know i've got there's two ways that people that are listening to this show can help me one they
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:38.800]  can go to shippercent.com and make a donation we need a lot of money now to to be able to afford
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:44.000]  the media that we need to win in the closing weeks of the primers so i need donations so you can
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:48.240]  donate personally you can talk to your friends about donating but if you're you know once you
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:53.760]  donated all that you can if you can donate some of your time every day for the next month to my
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:59.040]  phone banking system right on the front page of my website there's a big liberty ballot flashes
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:04.240]  back and forth for filing if you click on that and follow the instructions you can phone bank
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:09.040]  you can call it 800 number from the landline and then it's totally free all the long-distance
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:14.080]  charges are taken by the campaign and you don't even have to dial the program will dial for you
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:20.240]  and it's only dialing registered republicans in the state of connecticut and if a voicemail picks
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:25.600]  up you just push a button and it will leave a message from me about my campaign if a live
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:30.960]  person answers then you just talk you tell them about petership and then you go on to the next call
[02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:36.720]  there are some people one person made over 800 calls uh themself on saturday you know i'm giving
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:41.120]  out prizes every day free autograph copies of my book for the people who make the most calls
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:48.000]  yesterday's winner made 310 calls but on saturday we had over 400 people we made over 6 000 calls
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:55.040]  to register republicans my goal is to have 1 000 people making an average of 50 calls a day that
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:38:01.440]  would be 50 000 calls a day we would call every single registered republican several times and so
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:06.880]  we can win this thing and if i win the nomination i can win the general election it will be a huge
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:11.680]  publicity for me to come from behind to beat the establishment to beat linemik man's money
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:16.880]  and and dick blumenthal who's our attorney general he's vulnerable i can beat that guy especially
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:21.200]  if i debate him you know we had a debate initially when there were the three of us were there and i
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:26.720]  beat everybody so badly the press said that i won nobody came in second i can't nobody will debate
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:31.040]  me anymore well let me let me throw out some quick questions i want to go to calls in the time
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:36.160]  we have here peter uh but so people basically get where you stand on things but but let me bring up
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:42.080]  the toughest issue first but but i want to have the caveat up front i have watched the mainstream
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:47.840]  media who loved having you on about economics ignore your senate campaign because they are
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:52.720]  scared of you and you have been for abolishing the federal reserve and that's why i like you
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:57.440]  and support you and i think you're a great mind now expanding on that and i know your family
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:03.120]  going back years has done important work fighting this whole corrupt system but expanding on that
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:10.000]  i think it hurts you six eight months ago and and perhaps now you'd like to fill my listeners in
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:15.600]  on this when you said this is where we think those weapons are you need to let our inspectors in
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:22.320]  there if they don't let us in we just blow the place up speaking about iran uh and and and
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:26.960]  reported weapons sites so i mean obviously you don't have to be a carbon copy of ron paul for
[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:32.800]  people to support his son is a bit more hawkish than he is i would say you're a lot more hawkish
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:38.080]  from the statements i've seen but perhaps those are out of context because people really don't want
[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:42.880]  to have a war with iran that could lead to world war three and so people love you on economics and
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:48.080]  love you on the middle of rights and your stance there a lot of people that were really hot on
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:52.320]  your campaign you know and they called me wanting me to bash you i didn't do it you know i've been
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:57.600]  neutral on this because i know you are better than the people that are you know running against you
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:02.320]  right now and so i understand this isn't a perfect world i mean i wouldn't be a perfect main problem
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:08.240]  that ron paul had in the campaign and i think again you know i i think the criticism was not
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:13.120]  warranted of ron but they were like i love them on the economy but i just can't vote for him because
[02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:18.800]  he's he's choosing his defense is national security so i've got a winner republican primary so i can't
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:25.280]  appear as if i don't want any national defense okay and what i said in that one interview again
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:30.320]  and and people spun it all out of proportion they said what they did i gave me a hypothetical question
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:36.560]  what if iran was developing nuclear weapons what would you do if they had nuclear weapons i said well
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:41.120]  first i want to verify that they actually have them all right i mean if they have nuclear weapons
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:48.000]  we need to find some method of diplomacy to verify if our intelligence is accurate it is is iran
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:53.040]  building nuclear weapons if they are building nuclear weapons that is something that i as an
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:58.800]  american take as a serious threat i do not think that we should allow iran to build nuclear weapons
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:04.880]  and what i said is if diplomacy fails and we have credible intelligence that says here is a facility
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:09.520]  where they are developing nuclear weapons i am not against using a military action
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:15.280]  to neutralize that facility to bomb that facility i said i am not in favor of invading and occupying
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:22.000]  the country i don't want to do that but i do want to use our might to prevent a nuclear weapon from
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.480]  being developed in a potential hostile part of the world i don't want to wait for them to launch it
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:33.600]  and watch millions of people die and then retaliate if we can simply and um you know decisively
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:38.720]  uh and surgically remove that kind of threat then that's what we need to do and that's what
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:43.520]  americans want they don't they don't they don't want their leaders to sit by and watch the atomic
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:48.640]  bomb be built by rand and wait for them to drop it in an american city and then do something we
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:53.280]  can act preventively to protect ourselves but i don't want to build an empire i want to end
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:58.240]  wars in iraq and i ran i want to bring our troops home from western europe and japan i want national
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:02.720]  defense to be the top priority of the federal government but i want to spend a lot less money
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:06.320]  to the defense department because i think it's all a bunch of pork well peter so the stuff that
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:10.480]  we're doing peter that's all let's say i mean that's very eloquently said the issue is we have a
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:16.320]  federal government that lied to us about wmds in iraq premeditatedly yellow cake aluminum
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:22.960]  tubes so we've seen all this before and now and now even remember alex i was against in real time
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:27.760]  going into iraq i criticized the president bush for going into iraq no no peter i understand that
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:30.960]  what i'm trying to get across to you now you're a smart guy but for the audience here this as well
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:37.920]  is that now we have a lot of republicans coming out saying afghanistan is obama's war we have the
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:44.960]  head of the republican party still saying that we have rohrbacher saying that most house republicans
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:50.320]  think we shouldn't have gone to iraq now i'm just simply saying that i think ron paul's right about
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:56.560]  iran and even if they were to get a nuclear weapon which their system is peaceful uh that we then if
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:43:01.680]  they were to attack us we turn them into a glass parking lot we don't just sit there and say well
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:07.360]  just because we think you're developing a nuke we're going to blow your factory up now now again
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:11.920]  i understand you wouldn't be the president if you were in the senate and certainly the system is
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:16.480]  ignoring you or attacking you so that shows that they don't want you to be senator that's why i've
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:20.880]  got you here and i support you i'm just telling you that i will probably be attacked you know for
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:24.560]  saying peter schiff is better than these other candidates and so i was putting that out there
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:30.720]  on the table because i am against attacking iran i mean i am against preemptive strikes on countries
[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:36.560]  people peter wants to evade iran i don't want to attack iran the question was if we knew for sure
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:41.600]  that they were developing a nuclear weapon would i be in favor of stopping that from happening and
[02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:46.960]  the answer is yes i don't think a nuclear iran is something that we should allow now ron paul's
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:51.280]  position has looked to soviet union had all these news and they didn't fire them because they were
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:55.840]  more rational all right the terrorists are not rational they're willing to die for a cause they
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:44:01.040]  don't care if we fire back it's not like mutually assured destruction they don't care if they get
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:06.720]  destroyed and so if we're gonna say okay yes i think we should take action if we know for sure
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:11.760]  for sure that they're developing a nuclear weapon obviously they're developing and to use it so we
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:17.040]  peter we have a government we have a government to lie to us if somebody doesn't want to support me
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:22.080]  and they'd rather have linemig man or they'd rather have um take blooming fall who are going to be
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:25.920]  far far worse who are going to be for preemptive wars who are going to help destroy this country
[02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:29.600]  see that's the thing you're never going to find a candidate that you can agree with
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:35.520]  on 100 of the issues if you find somebody that you agree with 99 out of 100 you're going to say oh
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:40.240]  here's one thing i disagree with oh i'm not going to support him at all i mean that's crazy no i
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:44.880]  no i agree with you but peter you're a well-spoken intelligent guy who's made a lot of accurate
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:53.360]  predictions and i'm only saying that with the grassroots with the ron paul base i think you
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:45:00.480]  would have seen the you know the type of rand paul level support uh if you wouldn't have made that
[02:45:00.480 --> 02:45:06.800]  hawkish statement but i understand your view i don't agree with it because i can't believe this
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:14.400]  government to give accurate intelligence and i agree with ron paul on his view about the fact
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:19.680]  that if we actually tried to be friends with iran a government we've overthrown before uh and
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.840]  worked with the softliners like they had five years ago instead of always trying to start a war
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:29.520]  with them uh that that this even wouldn't be an issue and i'll tell you one thing though i would
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:34.240]  tell you one thing if i was going to take the position that a nuclear iran was okay with me
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:37.760]  then there'd be no point in my even asking for volunteers because i couldn't win in the state
[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:42.480]  of connecticut so if i actually adopted that position it wouldn't matter how many people worked
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:48.560]  for my campaign i couldn't get elected so people have to decide is there enough positive things i
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:52.000]  want to go there and shut down the government i want to stop the depths of spending i want to
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:56.400]  restore sanity you know i don't want to see this country collapse and that's what i'm going to do
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:46:00.640]  and and and and if you and if people are going to see g peter some kind of warm auger i mean if
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:06.800]  you think i'm going to wash it in to start a war i mean you're crazy computer no body look i'm not
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:10.960]  saying that but i know there were some people that did and and your implication is gee i would have
[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:16.240]  had a lot more support if it wasn't for that well you know if i had answered if i if i had come out
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:20.880]  for what they want as i said there'd be no reason to support me because i couldn't win and so you
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:25.520]  know what do we want hallow victory do you want i think i think the statement is if i ran develop
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:29.920]  nuclear weapons and there was provable intelligence that they were going to try to deploy it and we're
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:34.640]  putting out rhetoric like they would use it you know then and i think people would understand
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:39.120]  that more than just saying blow the place up but i understand blow the place up i didn't say blow
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:44.480]  the country up you can blow up the facility drop leaflets tell people to get out of there no i was
[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:48.000]  just reading your quote and i understand i understand you're saying the place with the
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:52.960]  weapons but i was quoting just blow the place up i don't mean i ran it's it's it's weird and that's
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:57.680]  if we know that they're there it's such a i'm trying to do the absolute minimum and then there are
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:02.640]  people don't know we don't even want to do that we want to wait until i ran actually drop the
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:07.680]  nuclear weapon smuggled it into a major american city murders millions of people and then we'll
[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:12.720]  respond that is not the credible policy for a senate candidate i don't think
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:18.400]  a peter let's go for me and i'll allow a nuclear weapon to be blown up in your backyard i don't
[02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:24.080]  have to picture i'm not so well look but believe me that's what my opponents would say if that was
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:28.240]  my position no i understand i was just getting the issue out there because i mean as you know
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:32.240]  that was raised quite a bit and it's i i hope you beat those other candidates that's why we've got
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:36.960]  you here i i mean i think you'd be a great guy that really pushed through the audit of the fed and
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:41.040]  i'd love to see you grilling them and banking committee meetings it'd be wonderful and i think
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:45.280]  you've got a shot at it so people should certainly support uh i just would be remiss if i didn't
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:49.360]  raise that let's jam in a few calls here and then at the end i want to ask you about your view on
[02:47:49.360 --> 02:47:55.440]  the arizona situation and the borders uh let's talk to ken in uh california go ahead ken you're on
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:48:04.000]  the air oh hi thank you elix uh this is my question uh walmart had record profits for several years
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:10.080]  and uh they got sued all by counties all over the united states because they would provide no
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:17.840]  health insurance for 90 percent of their workers then after this health care bill came out all these
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:25.440]  lawsuits have been disappeared or dropped and here's my question um would you be willing to
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:33.520]  write a bill that overturns the health care bill and would you be willing to like investigate
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:40.400]  a company like walmart that has caused all this debt to these counties because they're making
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:44.400]  their workers go to the county walmart's had unfair trade advantage with its inside deals with
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:48.000]  china that's where the issue is what would you do with health care peter shift right while writing
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:52.640]  a bill to repeal it is is useless at this point because it's not going to get passed and obama's
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:58.560]  not going to sign it what i want to do is defund it i want to i want to lead the filibuster in the
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:04.000]  senate against raising the debt ceiling that's something that i can do and if i can convince
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:09.520]  40 other republicans to stand with me and refuse to sign an increase in the debt ceiling then the
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:14.320]  borrowing stops and if they can't buy no more bailouts and no more bailouts you mean you pledge
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:19.280]  no more bailouts either there's there's no more any if right now the government is borrowing
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:25.040]  60 cents uh you know it collects a dollar in taxes it spends a dollar 60 so 60 cents of every
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:30.720]  dollar 60 is borrowed so if i can stop them from raising the debt ceiling they can't spend that 60
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:36.320]  cents all right got a jam and another call in in in uh england you're on the air with peter shift
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:44.880]  yeah go ahead um thank you alex um good to speak to you and mr schiff um one of the things i mean
[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:51.680]  i was going to burden out more um regarding the um the the dollar obviously being the uh
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:59.920]  international monthly um system and uh what what influence do you think that there's going to be
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:05.840]  with regards to that because it took two world wars to break britain from the uh the end as being
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:11.040]  the international reserve currency yeah that's a good question what happens when we lose the
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:15.360]  dollar is the world reserve currency oh i mean it's not a question that can we it's just when we
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:20.160]  and you know will it happen next year in two years from now you know it's going to happen i mean you
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:25.040]  can't we became the world's reserve currency because the dollar was backed by gold because we
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:29.200]  were the world's biggest creditor nation we had the least amount of government regulations and the
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:33.680]  lowest taxes we were flooding the world with with with with investment capital and manufacturing
[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:39.040]  goods i mean we have nothing in common with the america uh that that was able to secure the dollars
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:42.160]  of world reserve currency we're now the world's biggest debtor we have huge straight deficits
[02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:47.120]  current account deficit we have no domestic so he's saying how do you see it dying it is going to die
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:52.000]  because world central banks stop supporting it i mean people they won't buy our debt anymore it's
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:56.960]  coming we are living in the final days of the dollars reserve currency i just i don't know how
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:51:00.320]  many days stay there peter final segment peter she had more calls straight ahead

[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:31.600]  and on arizona well you know i think protecting the borders is one of the few things this federal
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:34.800]  government should be doing and it's not doing it because it's doing so many things that it
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:38.800]  shouldn't be doing so i do want to crack down an illegal immigration but i want to make it easier
[02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:42.560]  for people who want to work at the immigration of the country but you know i'm more concerned
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:46.560]  about immigration i think if we don't do the right thing waves and waves americans are going to be
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:51.520]  fleeing the country to escape oppressive taxation regulation and inflation and i want to make sure
[02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:56.720]  that young americans stay here and don't leave the country well mexico needs to fix its house instead
[02:54:56.720 --> 02:55:01.200]  of letting their whole system collapse into the united states i mean this is ridiculous uh the
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:04.800]  second amendment where do you stand on that i stand right behind it and you know it's not about
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:09.680]  hunting and it's not about a militia it's about preserving liberty keeping the government in check
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:14.800]  americans need to be armed they you know to preserve liberty and of course for crime i mean if you
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:19.280]  have if you have gun control all you do is take the guns away from law-abiding citizens and you
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:25.920]  empower the criminals uh because they know they're been victims or defenseless chef for senate.com our

[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:14.720]  preserve the constitution restore freedom restore liberty embrace the principles that made us wealthy
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:21.600]  don't follow the principles that impoverished other nations let's go ahead thank you caller let's go
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:28.800]  ahead and talk to jim and illinois has a question about mortgages go ahead jim oh yes peter i'm sick
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:34.720]  of the old battle cry of people that uh got mortgages they couldn't afford i was able to afford
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:42.080]  buying that was 10 years ago my income has been cut in half i'm self-employed i don't get unemployment
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:47.600]  insurance that's a big net you haven't addressed i haven't heard anyone address what are i supposed
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:54.560]  to do about what where do i turn well you're not saying you deserve to lose your mortgage i mean
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:58.640]  that there's too many taxes at first of all we got to get the government out of the mortgage
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:02.960]  business people should not be buying houses that they can't afford and if you need a government to
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:07.200]  guarantee the mortgage then you can't afford that house you know if you don't have a 20 down payment
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:11.920]  you can't afford that house we need to have a free market in house well government money in housing
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:16.400]  peter as you know is what drove up prices yes i know we got to get the government out of that we
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:20.800]  need no more subsidies we have to have a free market in housing and of course it's going to mean lower
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:25.040]  housing prices which is going to benefit people who want to buy houses because they'll be a lot less
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:29.840]  expensive yeah jim the answer is if they wouldn't have put these trillions of dollars in a government
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:34.000]  money you wouldn't have had all the flipping of houses and your house wouldn't be too expensive i
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:38.800]  appreciate your call matthew in canada last caller quick question for peter shiff yes hello mr
[02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:45.200]  shiff uh my question is uh i'm again the citizen and um i was just wondering how do you see the
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:50.160]  state of the canadian economy uh given the fact that the american economy is going down to drain
[02:57:50.800 --> 02:57:55.040]  i think it's much better you know i've invested quite a bit of money in canadian securities
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:59.520]  i think canada kind of got its its a fiscal house in order over a decade ago when they were having
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:04.080]  some problems it's not a paradise up there in canada but compared to us they are and i think
[02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:08.400]  you know we're having problems with immigration from south of our border pretty soon the canadiens
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:12.080]  are going to have the same problem with americans but i think that they will embrace us i think as
[02:58:12.080 --> 02:58:18.560]  american refugees uh flee america uh for uh you know freer planes up in canada i think they will
[02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:23.200]  welcome americans i think unfortunately a lot of americans are going to find uh you know canada to
[02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:28.080]  be their home i mean it's a little colder up there yeah we're out of time uh canada is rated
[02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:32.320]  number one in the world right now for economies but that doesn't mean much when it's a worldwide
[02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:36.640]  depression peter shiff i appreciate you joining us we'll talk to you again right ahead of the
