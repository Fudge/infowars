[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:30.580]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.580 --> 00:37.020]  there is a veritable orgy of over-the-top important news and information the cover
[00:37.020 --> 00:44.700]  today on the 17th day of August 2015 Monday broadcast I'm your host Alex
[00:44.700 --> 00:50.940]  Jones we're simulcasting via the radio and TV at info wars.com forward slash
[00:50.940 --> 00:55.220]  show and on over a hundred and seventy AM and FM affiliates across the United
[00:55.220 --> 01:01.300]  States global shortwave WWCR satellite and many other platforms again thank you
[01:01.300 --> 01:06.980]  for joining us there is a ton of huge news today obviously I'm gonna be
[01:06.980 --> 01:12.700]  plowing back in to Donald Trump coming out against Hillary and saying she
[01:12.700 --> 01:17.900]  should step down and that basically she's a criminal that is not the actions
[01:17.900 --> 01:26.900]  of somebody who is working for the Clintons and when he piled on you can
[01:26.900 --> 01:32.100]  definitely say that that was the straw that broke the camel's back and if you
[01:32.100 --> 01:37.260]  look at drudgereport.com today there's the Washington Post Bob Woodward of
[01:37.260 --> 01:43.500]  Naval Intelligence he was sent to bring down Nixon not saying Nixon was good but
[01:43.500 --> 01:47.940]  it was a governmental coup over the executive branch now we have that same
[01:47.940 --> 01:52.420]  corporate coup over all the branches that's what globalism is there's a
[01:52.420 --> 01:58.500]  corporate takeover but Woodward now firing at the Clintons something he's
[01:58.500 --> 02:04.500]  never done and when that starts happening we are now approaching the point
[02:04.500 --> 02:10.220]  where I think it's about a 90% chance the Clintons are gonna be destroyed they
[02:10.220 --> 02:13.380]  know where the dirt is they know where the bodies are buried they know where
[02:13.380 --> 02:18.380]  the skeletons are they know what closets to look in but the whole systems
[02:18.380 --> 02:23.620]  lining up against them right now and they are in what I believe a terminal
[02:23.620 --> 02:30.100]  spiral they may just scurry off like Pope Benedict to you know Gandolf Castle
[02:30.100 --> 02:39.740]  figuratively into abstentia you know into some type of purgatory but they are
[02:39.740 --> 02:45.060]  critically politically wounded Clinton looks like he's dying that may have
[02:45.060 --> 02:50.100]  something to do with it Bill Clinton looks like he is a couple steps from the
[02:50.100 --> 02:56.300]  grave Bob Woodward he says reminds me of the Nixon tapes talking about Hillary
[02:56.300 --> 03:04.620]  and the erased emails again last week when the FBI raided her offices they
[03:04.620 --> 03:07.500]  spun it that oh they just came and picked up hard drives no they raided
[03:07.500 --> 03:14.260]  Hillary's offices and her staff and then the entire chain to show the
[03:14.260 --> 03:19.700]  obstruction of justice Holder has left he's put somebody in who's continuing the
[03:19.700 --> 03:26.580]  persecution via the IRS of Liberty groups so I don't know what to say at this
[03:26.580 --> 03:31.460]  point but there is a major battle going on in government I've got a pretty good
[03:31.460 --> 03:35.420]  idea exactly what's going on we'll break it down today but I want to go out to
[03:35.420 --> 03:40.540]  break with this clip we played yesterday it's been airing since Friday with

[04:49.780 --> 04:53.300]  not that she's a criminal totally legitimate just let her do whatever she

[08:49.900 --> 09:00.100]  central as well details at info wars news.com or prisonplanet.tv let me
[09:00.100 --> 09:03.420]  mention just some of the big news we're gonna be covering today some of the
[09:03.420 --> 09:07.860]  guests that are coming up and then I will plow into the latest on Donald Trump
[09:07.860 --> 09:15.980]  and how serious the situation is getting for the establishment my gut tells me
[09:15.980 --> 09:20.460]  not to completely trust Donald Trump but also not to completely judge him and
[09:20.460 --> 09:27.740]  say that he's an operative completely and now I've moved from 50-50 on Trump to
[09:27.740 --> 09:31.700]  60-40 towards him
[09:31.700 --> 09:42.620]  because what he's doing is hurting the establishment and I could see all the
[09:42.620 --> 09:48.620]  angles of how he ends up helping Hillary in fact we have a piece Paul Watson did
[09:48.620 --> 09:53.340]  last week for info wars nightly news I never aired on the radio I want to play
[09:53.340 --> 10:00.780]  that with his perspective on how Trump's bad at the bottom of the hour but
[10:00.780 --> 10:07.660]  then I'm gonna go over why Trump may be good and I want to be clear I'm not
[10:07.660 --> 10:15.380]  endorsing Donald Trump I'm simply just not going to be the ultimate cynic
[10:15.620 --> 10:25.500]  ultimate critic I'm gonna wait until he sells people out and then not just my
[10:25.500 --> 10:28.900]  self but tens of millions of others are gonna make sure he's politically and
[10:28.900 --> 10:34.540]  financially punished and Trump's not stupid that's why I've looked at every
[10:34.540 --> 10:41.860]  angle and something big's going on here and it's beyond Trump that's coming up
[10:41.860 --> 10:46.780]  now let's get to the most important news that's bigger than this country bigger
[10:46.780 --> 10:52.260]  than Donald Trump bigger than this election this is the one in telegraph
[10:52.260 --> 10:56.740]  this is not info wars but they're saying exactly what we're saying after we
[10:56.740 --> 11:01.180]  been saying it doomsday clock for global market crash strikes one minute to
[11:01.180 --> 11:07.740]  midnight as central banks lose control that's coming up that's on info wars
[11:07.740 --> 11:14.300]  dot com right now Ron Paul fed may need hike because everything is vulnerable
[11:14.300 --> 11:19.780]  China's mood to devalue its currency roiled the markets last week and stuck
[11:19.780 --> 11:24.940]  new fears about the health world's third largest economy China has the second
[11:24.940 --> 11:30.580]  largest company did you know that the US no longer has any strategic grain
[11:30.580 --> 11:36.260]  reserves at all yeah and the food banks are running out of food and I mean at a
[11:36.260 --> 11:42.820]  record level you got a hundred million people on food assistance 100 million
[11:42.820 --> 11:49.980]  like 101 mil right at 46 to 49 depending on the month on direct digital food
[11:49.980 --> 11:56.580]  stamp Greek government on its last legs while Angela Merkel faces growing
[11:56.580 --> 12:04.660]  rebellion in Berlin deep wounds within the ruling party are growing disquiet in
[12:04.660 --> 12:09.220]  Berlin threatened to derail political support before the new 86 billion Greek
[12:09.220 --> 12:15.860]  rescue is secured even the next bank or snack that they admit won't even get
[12:15.860 --> 12:20.820]  out of debt so that's some of the news on that front hundreds of casualties in
[12:20.820 --> 12:26.740]  air raids on Syrian market and the media is demonizing the Syrian
[12:26.740 --> 12:29.500]  government saying how dare they it looks like a bunch of civilians got killed
[12:29.500 --> 12:34.860]  because al Qaeda ISIS as they always do base their head base in the city they
[12:34.860 --> 12:38.340]  taken over this is admitted in the middle of the market because there's
[12:38.340 --> 12:44.500]  buildings within the market Syria has now turned the tide against the rebels
[12:44.500 --> 12:49.340]  two years ago now they've had the tide turn against them the rebels hold more
[12:49.340 --> 12:54.060]  than 60% of the country they're taking major towns and cities every week Russia
[12:54.060 --> 12:58.900]  is basically starting to withdraw support from Syria it looks like it's
[12:58.900 --> 13:04.140]  going to fall to al Qaeda and they are going to murder every Christian and Jew
[13:04.140 --> 13:08.540]  they get their hands on and then you'll hear our media go gee Syria so failed
[13:08.540 --> 13:19.380]  they're killing everyone it's so sad just like Libya so the UA condemned Syrian
[13:19.380 --> 13:25.020]  market attack as witnesses tell of corpses everywhere the United States was
[13:25.020 --> 13:31.380]  attacked by Japan and four years later dropped to atomic bombs on Hiroshima and
[13:31.380 --> 13:36.100]  Nagasaki you can question that in hindsight but the United States was
[13:36.100 --> 13:43.780]  fighting for its life at one point and so morally historically we probably went
[13:43.780 --> 13:48.300]  overboard but you can still say doesn't matter we need to start the fight it's
[13:48.300 --> 13:51.620]  like if some guy starts a fight with you and you fight back and he falls down and
[13:51.620 --> 13:58.180]  hits his head on the pavement goes into a coma and dies from a sub dermal hematoma
[13:58.180 --> 14:02.540]  they might even take you to jail for it but the grand jury says no indictment
[14:02.540 --> 14:09.820]  because the witnesses come in and say mr. Smith attacked mr. Johnson or mr.
[14:09.820 --> 14:14.140]  mr. Jones attacked mr. Sanchez
[14:15.140 --> 14:20.380]  Syria is fighting for its life al Qaeda bases itself in the middle of civilian
[14:20.380 --> 14:22.700]  areas
[14:25.220 --> 14:28.540]  Syria has not been targeting civilians but now they're fighting for their life
[14:28.540 --> 14:35.820]  they've got to take out al Qaeda and these towns and cities that have markets
[14:35.820 --> 14:40.420]  and let al Qaeda sit there and be based in their town I mean what do you expect
[14:40.420 --> 14:45.220]  to happen because here's the deal Syria is fighting for its life and this could
[14:45.220 --> 14:49.660]  go on for a couple more years it's over 350,000 people now dead almost all of
[14:49.660 --> 14:56.020]  them killed by the al Qaeda forces and our media is just really getting off on
[14:56.020 --> 15:02.780]  demonizing Syria right now and I'm sad for the civilians that are dead but Syria
[15:02.780 --> 15:05.740]  didn't start this
[15:06.500 --> 15:12.300]  where's the media when al Qaeda and ISIS the first three four years was doing
[15:12.300 --> 15:14.780]  this they wouldn't even cover they called them the wonderful rebels and
[15:14.780 --> 15:19.060]  John McCain went and met with them the main new group that the US has spent a
[15:19.060 --> 15:24.820]  year training 10,000 plus troops just swore allegiance to ISIS and al Nazareh
[15:24.820 --> 15:28.980]  last Friday curtain Emma wrote about it it was in Reuters as well but it's an
[15:28.980 --> 15:35.300]  info wars.com where is the coverage of that they kill hundreds of thousands of
[15:35.300 --> 15:40.100]  people they rape and murder women they rape women to death how do you do that
[15:40.100 --> 15:46.580]  they'll have like 300 guys rape and beat a woman was in the news just this
[15:46.580 --> 15:50.100]  weekend how they rape women to death until they die
[15:50.100 --> 15:57.900]  I just type ISIS rapes woman to death and they don't even do it for the sex
[15:57.900 --> 16:04.380]  they do it to torture what about you weird freaks rapes bad enough but my
[16:04.380 --> 16:10.340]  goodness hundreds of men keeping a woman up for three four days beating her and
[16:10.340 --> 16:13.420]  raping her to death
[16:13.420 --> 16:19.060]  Tyler Muller was raped by ISIS leader before her death say officials London

[16:23.260 --> 16:29.820]  saw they raped her to death and nothing's gonna be done about that I mean
[16:29.820 --> 16:36.940]  Jeb Bush is saying bomb Assad to stop ISIS what Trump's come out against him
[16:36.940 --> 16:42.380]  saying he's a puppet we're gonna get to all that Apollo 14 astronaut claims
[16:42.380 --> 16:48.060]  peace-loving aliens prevented nuclear war on earth Edgar Mitchell says flying
[16:48.060 --> 16:51.820]  saucers followed their ships on the moon that was kept classified for decades
[16:51.820 --> 16:55.540]  but Australian radio technicians were able to pick it up that's how we have
[16:55.540 --> 16:59.140]  the recordings there's a lot of weird stuff going on folks I don't even get
[16:59.140 --> 17:05.060]  into it but we're gonna be covering that inflatable space elevator invented by
[17:05.060 --> 17:09.380]  scientists that's really important new report massive immigration surge from
[17:09.380 --> 17:15.420]  Mexico taking place two white sorority video slam for being racially
[17:15.420 --> 17:21.060]  homogeneous just you know it's bad if you happen to be a predominantly white
[17:21.060 --> 17:24.740]  fraternity well why they're totally black fraternities totally Hispanic
[17:24.740 --> 17:27.260]  fraternities I mean I'm gonna do a piece where I'm gonna go out to some of
[17:27.260 --> 17:30.700]  these black bars in East Austin I'm gonna walk in with a camera I'm not
[17:30.700 --> 17:34.140]  kidding I have the time I'll do it or my reporters ought to I'm not scared to do
[17:34.140 --> 17:39.340]  it folks will laugh I think it's funny but I'm gonna go into a totally black
[17:39.340 --> 17:43.500]  bar there's a whole bunch of them in East Austin I'm gonna go why is this so

[17:54.900 --> 18:00.860]  and have a beer the point is is that it's not racist that if you grow up around a
[18:00.860 --> 18:03.980]  bunch of people and that's what you're used to that's what you do they got
[18:03.980 --> 18:07.300]  Japanese fraternities there's not Chinese in them they're Japanese they got
[18:07.300 --> 18:13.100]  Chinese fraternities there's not Mexicans in them because it's the culture it's
[18:13.100 --> 18:16.420]  what it is it's that if you hate other people and then don't want to work with
[18:16.420 --> 18:22.100]  them that's racist but we're gonna get to that it's all coming up now briefly

[24:20.980 --> 24:26.340]  for being racially homogeneous so if you ever see a rap video with nothing but
[24:26.340 --> 24:31.900]  black people in it or you ever see a Hispanic group of people out of the park
[24:31.900 --> 24:37.900]  go up and say why are you so racist why are there 300 Hispanic people at this
[24:37.900 --> 24:42.220]  park barbecuing where are the black people where the white people racist
[24:42.220 --> 24:49.940]  racist racist no what's racist is implying that being white or being black or
[24:49.940 --> 24:55.260]  being Hispanic is inherently bad and the feminist group is complaining about this
[24:55.260 --> 25:00.260]  doesn't like it because it's a bunch of really good-looking women and as we know
[25:00.260 --> 25:03.380]  modern feminists for whatever reason they have international studies out are
[25:03.380 --> 25:08.700]  three times fatter and on beauty scales much lower and it turns out they want
[25:08.700 --> 25:13.860]  to dominate women and tell women what to do and I'm not against lesbians or
[25:13.860 --> 25:18.220]  anything but let's face it predominantly a lot of hardcore feminists are lesbians
[25:18.220 --> 25:24.340]  who just want to pimp women and hey I'm more power Joe I mean I'm being
[25:24.340 --> 25:28.780]  sarcastic but I mean I am impressed by some of the dog ugly women I see wearing
[25:28.780 --> 25:32.540]  you know blue jeans they got a chain on their wallet short haircut and they're
[25:32.540 --> 25:36.340]  dressing down their hot blonde girlfriend you know who's got her nails done
[25:36.340 --> 25:40.140]  just right looks like Marilyn Monroe and I hear about the police reports where
[25:40.140 --> 25:44.500]  you got the lesbians beating up their girlfriends and their wives I mean you'll
[25:44.500 --> 25:48.380]  feel like some giant you know fat woman with tattoos everywhere she's got a
[25:48.380 --> 25:52.780]  girlfriend looks like she's gonna be the centerfold next week's playboy and
[25:52.780 --> 25:58.060]  that's just how they roll and the women bow down and they follow their daddy I
[25:58.060 --> 26:04.060]  mean I'm sorry that's what this is really all about and of course Gloria
[26:04.060 --> 26:07.700]  Steinem also tells you that you shouldn't have any kids but she's got a
[26:07.700 --> 26:11.540]  whole bunch of them so a lot of them are just traditional women as well they
[26:11.540 --> 26:18.500]  just want to tell women what to do that's a big market not me I just want
[26:18.500 --> 26:22.460]  to empower women I got two daughters and you know that's why they're starting to
[26:22.460 --> 26:26.740]  take martial arts and learn how to shoot and I'm teaching them you know that if
[26:26.740 --> 26:30.820]  somebody attacks them how to kick them in the groin and they're learning how to
[26:30.820 --> 26:34.140]  defend themselves and that's something feminists wouldn't do because they want
[26:34.140 --> 26:40.140]  women domesticated and families broken up so that woman can be alone at 45 and
[26:40.140 --> 26:43.580]  can't have kids and doesn't have a man around so they can be comfortably
[26:43.580 --> 26:49.980]  euthanized at 65 and that's the actuary plan so we're gonna get into that coming
[26:49.980 --> 26:58.500]  up but you gotta admit it's a great con game it's a great confidence game by
[26:58.500 --> 27:03.740]  Hillary and all the rest of her types that they are the men now and they
[27:03.740 --> 27:07.540]  dress like men they talk like men they've taught men to be subservient back
[27:07.540 --> 27:11.740]  like little boys and they get all the girls Hillary gets all the girls for
[27:11.740 --> 27:16.620]  herself and she should be proud of that I mean you think these Mac daddy rapper
[27:16.620 --> 27:20.620]  guys got a bunch of girls in their videos Hillary's got it for real rolling in
[27:20.620 --> 27:27.300]  the crib she got the drugs everything party time baby and Bill likes the girls
[27:27.300 --> 27:31.220]  too they we got Larry Nichols coming on tell us all about it former Clinton
[27:31.220 --> 27:34.060]  insider even the New York Times admits that's who Clinton worries about at
[27:34.060 --> 27:37.740]  night worked about the fall of Hillary Clinton and Bill coming up it looks like
[27:37.740 --> 27:44.820]  it might be happening but speaking of the devil let's go to this clip of
[27:44.820 --> 27:52.060]  Hillary talking about how Vladimir Putin is like the guy from House of Cards
[27:52.060 --> 27:56.340]  now Vladimir Putin's former KGB and a tough guy and reportedly was an assassin
[27:56.340 --> 28:03.820]  and but he rules by straight shooting and has an 87% approval rating he's a
[28:03.820 --> 28:09.380]  strong man publicly House of Cards guy is a manipulating crook who acts like a
[28:09.380 --> 28:15.020]  sweet non-threatening person that's you Hillary so here she is saying Putin is
[28:15.020 --> 28:22.540]  House of Cards you talk about distorting reality here it is finally just let me
[28:22.540 --> 28:26.100]  quickly say Putin and Russia
[28:26.100 --> 28:36.020]  troubling how many of you've seen the last season of House of Cards I mean
[28:36.020 --> 28:41.980]  he's a lot taller than Putin but the actor playing him based on my experience
[28:41.980 --> 28:50.220]  negotiating with and being with Putin is right on the money it's really quite
[28:50.220 --> 28:54.620]  remarkable this woman is working with Soros with five billion to overthrow
[28:54.620 --> 28:59.060]  Ukraine did that they're attacking Russia they're trying to bankrupt Russia
[28:59.060 --> 29:07.060]  which will then hurt Europe and hurt the US she's a total crook a lying fraud and
[29:07.060 --> 29:12.620]  then she says Putin operates like that Putin operates the opposite a classic
[29:12.620 --> 29:18.420]  Russian strongman straight shooting but he will not sit there and sell his
[29:18.420 --> 29:26.660]  country up and so Hillary hates his guts she's the gangster making jokes about
[29:26.660 --> 29:30.460]  disappearing her emails making jokes about she came to Libya and Gaddafi died
[29:30.460 --> 29:37.380]  if it will cue that up that's House of Cards crap I mean basically House of Cards
[29:37.380 --> 29:41.180]  is based on a Democrat based on the Clintons so it's just a sick joke and
[29:41.180 --> 29:48.420]  everybody knows in Hollywood that's based on the Clintons a Southern politician we're
[29:48.420 --> 29:56.900]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.060 --> 30:02.340]  wire is reporting that hackers can disable a sniper rifle or change its
[30:02.340 --> 30:06.300]  target in two weeks at the Black Hat hacker conference a pair of researchers
[30:06.300 --> 30:10.660]  plan on presenting results of a year's worth of hacking a pair of $13,000
[30:10.660 --> 30:14.100]  tracking points self-aiming rifles the hacker couple has developed a set of
[30:14.100 --> 30:17.780]  techniques that could allow an attacker to compromise the rifle via its Wi-Fi
[30:17.780 --> 30:21.580]  connection and exploit vulnerabilities in its software their tricks can change
[30:21.580 --> 30:25.060]  variables and the scope's calculations make the rifle miss its target
[30:25.060 --> 30:28.900]  permanently disable the scope computer or even prevent the gun from firing the
[30:28.900 --> 30:33.060]  rifle maker tracking point launched in 2011 sold more than a thousand of its
[30:33.060 --> 30:36.500]  Linux powered rifles with a self-aiming system the scope allows you to
[30:36.500 --> 30:39.380]  designate a target and dial in the variables like wind temperature and
[30:39.380 --> 30:42.500]  weight of the ammunition being fired the result is a weapon that can allow
[30:42.500 --> 30:46.940]  even a gun novice to reliably hit targets as far as a mile away but like
[30:46.940 --> 30:50.460]  everything else tied to the grid these two researchers are showing that it can

[34:12.740 --> 34:19.620]  much for your support I want to get into the huge economic news that continues
[34:19.620 --> 34:25.500]  to get more dire and a lot of people say oh be confident that'll fix things
[34:25.500 --> 34:30.700]  that's what's maneuvered us into this position there are ways to turn our
[34:30.700 --> 34:37.140]  economies back on cut taxes and cut government spending and there will be
[34:37.140 --> 34:43.940]  some pain but if we don't it'll be much worse historical mathematics common
[34:43.940 --> 34:51.780]  sense it all says it there's no debate and we're coming to the end of the line
[34:53.420 --> 34:59.980]  who does that song Tom Petty at the end of the line at the end of the line
[34:59.980 --> 35:04.940]  it'll play that coming up the start of the next segment because we're coming to
[35:04.940 --> 35:09.860]  the end of the line and I want there to be something decent at the end of the
[35:09.860 --> 35:13.180]  line the line we're going down here on this train goes to a very bad place
[35:13.180 --> 35:19.420]  there's a few spurs there's a few other switch points we could go somewhere else
[35:19.420 --> 35:27.820]  coming up but already earlier turns that were a lot better we've gone past those
[35:27.820 --> 35:33.820]  and in the future the train only goes forward so we've got to exit here quick
[35:33.820 --> 35:40.140]  we got to pick the right exit and so that's why I'm getting in to the problems
[35:40.140 --> 35:45.540]  he is not to scare people but to admit the problems we have so we can do
[35:45.540 --> 35:52.380]  something about them so many people criticize this broadcast saying man it's
[35:52.380 --> 35:59.020]  just gloom and doom it's so negative he just wants to scare you and I guess it
[35:59.020 --> 36:07.660]  really is a fundamental difference in philosophies because if my house is
[36:07.660 --> 36:13.260]  being robbed and my neighbors across the street while I'm asleep and sees the
[36:13.260 --> 36:19.940]  person breaking in my back door and my neighbor calls up and says hey Alex looks
[36:19.940 --> 36:24.580]  like somebody's breaking in your back door I've called 9-1-1 well thank you
[36:24.580 --> 36:32.140]  Bill and I'm gonna grab my handgun out of the instance access safe I have and
[36:32.140 --> 36:40.620]  I'm going to then proceed to the stairway and I'm gonna wait till that
[36:40.620 --> 36:50.060]  person tries to come up and I'm gonna shoot him and it's not because I'm
[36:50.060 --> 36:54.580]  afraid it's just it's an instinct that I've got to take action to defend my
[36:54.580 --> 37:04.420]  family and I'm not mad at my neighbor if they call and tell me the bad news so
[37:04.420 --> 37:07.900]  many times in my life I've had crew members great people that didn't want
[37:07.900 --> 37:12.460]  to tell me about something bad that had happened and over the years I've gotten
[37:12.460 --> 37:16.020]  folks to stop doing that or some of the people aren't here anymore who would
[37:16.020 --> 37:20.380]  keep things from me I'm not one of these people that doesn't want to know the
[37:20.380 --> 37:24.060]  bad news I want to know the whole of the truth to make preparation for it to
[37:24.060 --> 37:27.420]  quote Patrick Henry
[37:30.700 --> 37:35.420]  exposing the FEMA camps and that the fact that they're clandestinely setting
[37:35.420 --> 37:39.940]  them up is what will stop them being able to roll it out exposing the
[37:39.940 --> 37:43.420]  scariness that they admit they put fluoride in the water to lower fertility
[37:43.420 --> 37:50.540]  in dumbestown that's what's getting them to remove it exposing the fact that
[37:50.540 --> 37:54.500]  under black budget programs trillions have been siphoned off to build a
[37:54.500 --> 37:58.540]  parallel government that isn't to make people think it's invincible and above
[37:58.540 --> 38:02.220]  the law and we can't defeat it it's to point out it's illegitimate to bring it
[38:02.220 --> 38:08.580]  down and that's what history shows happens the elite don't want to talk
[38:08.580 --> 38:11.860]  about these negative things that they're doing because they want to keep us in the
[38:11.860 --> 38:19.860]  dark I mean this is all elementary just like politicians are told by the
[38:19.860 --> 38:24.100]  media and the pundits don't get aggressive don't be confident don't
[38:24.100 --> 38:30.220]  attack your enemies be nice be milk toast have the nicest hair and the nicest
[38:30.220 --> 38:35.980]  tie you know that's not really what people are looking for they love Donald
[38:35.980 --> 38:42.580]  Trump with a baseball cap on and no tie they love the fact that he doesn't
[38:42.580 --> 38:50.260]  apologize they love the fact that he is arrogant because they're sick of
[38:50.260 --> 38:59.860]  beady-eyed people like John Boehner and Obama up there BSing people now before
[38:59.860 --> 39:04.660]  I get into the economic news and all the rest of it in detail and before Larry
[39:04.660 --> 39:07.820]  Nichols the big Clinton insider joins us to get into what could be the fall of
[39:07.820 --> 39:11.900]  Hillary Clinton we've been praying for and why that's so important and before
[39:11.900 --> 39:15.260]  Gerald Salente joins us on the world economic markets we're going to take
[39:15.260 --> 39:23.020]  calls as well I wanted to get more into Trump I've talked about Trump's
[39:23.020 --> 39:27.380]  background the casinos the giving to both parties the fact that I don't trust
[39:27.380 --> 39:31.420]  him completely that doesn't mean I'm demonizing him because saying the
[39:31.420 --> 39:37.420]  things he's saying are true and their important debates he's triggering the
[39:37.420 --> 39:41.900]  mainstream media clearly attacked him to build him up or to destroy him I'm not
[39:41.900 --> 39:49.500]  sure which it's backfired they tried to have the Republicans and the Democrats
[39:49.500 --> 39:55.180]  destroying people are supporting him out of a protest vote by the way as you guys
[39:55.180 --> 39:59.900]  get Watson's clip I want to play that coming up his analysis on Trump I sent
[39:59.900 --> 40:09.980]  this morning good we're gonna play that coming up here in a few minutes but
[40:09.980 --> 40:15.500]  also there's something called separation of powers and that is we have three
[40:15.500 --> 40:19.300]  branches of government knowing powerful personalities would end up battling with
[40:19.300 --> 40:23.020]  each other and that there would be territorial issues that's why we have
[40:23.020 --> 40:27.420]  jurisdictions so that you don't get one power that takes over everything it's
[40:27.420 --> 40:31.660]  like firewalls in a building or bulkheads in a ship to stop water or
[40:31.660 --> 40:38.780]  fire national sovereignty states county cities this divides things up so we
[40:38.780 --> 40:43.900]  don't get one gang one road warrior group led by the man on the white horse
[40:43.900 --> 40:50.940]  humongous to come in and say just give me the gas we spare your lives has been
[40:50.940 --> 40:59.660]  too much pain just leave the gas that big fat hog of a truck and go we spare
[40:59.660 --> 41:04.420]  your lives he sounds like a reasonable man I'm going out there you go out there
[41:04.420 --> 41:12.140]  and you get killed that's why we have our own divide and conquer against the
[41:12.140 --> 41:17.460]  elites they use it against us to keep us from getting together but we use the
[41:17.460 --> 41:20.900]  divide and conquer against them and Trump might really want to be president
[41:20.900 --> 41:25.860]  Trump makes his money off of a fat economy off of service he's service
[41:25.860 --> 41:31.860]  based predominantly and so he sees his profits going down he thinks he can do
[41:31.860 --> 41:36.140]  a better job it's good that he's a narcissist this attack on narcissism
[41:36.140 --> 41:40.060]  there's different types of it I know there's narcissistic rage and things
[41:40.060 --> 41:45.420]  like that that are real problems but just to say that somebody a leader is
[41:45.420 --> 41:49.100]  confident and wants to build something that message whether he means that or
[41:49.100 --> 41:55.260]  not is a true message in that the truth lives in its own statement it doesn't
[41:55.260 --> 42:04.660]  even matter if a liar says it and I'm not saying Trump's a liar and so you've
[42:04.660 --> 42:08.820]  got Hillary floundering around and you've got Trump piling on and that was
[42:08.820 --> 42:12.380]  the final signal when he said she's basically a criminal she should step
[42:12.380 --> 42:16.260]  down on meet the press and told CNN she's got a big problem it's criminal
[42:16.260 --> 42:26.020]  probe now Bob Woodward has come out and said that it reminds him of the Nixon
[42:26.020 --> 42:30.060]  tapes and there's video that we're gonna be playing coming up in the next
[42:30.060 --> 42:36.140]  segment and now there's a second server we learn about and now Trump it goes
[42:36.140 --> 42:41.460]  even further ahead in the polls and states where he was at number one that's
[42:41.460 --> 42:47.540]  up on info wars calm prison planet calm and drugs report calm but let's go
[42:47.540 --> 42:50.740]  through the real arrogance of Hillary I just played her you know basically
[42:50.740 --> 42:55.780]  saying that Putin is worse than Frank Underwood in House of Cards when that
[42:55.780 --> 42:59.980]  character is pretty much based on Bill Clinton and Hillary the team I mean
[42:59.980 --> 43:03.620]  that's admitted by the writers so that's the arrogance inverting reality yet
[43:03.620 --> 43:11.980]  again here's Hillary on her servers and on snapchat again here's her arrogance
[43:11.980 --> 43:17.580]  on that front so I am delighted delighted to be here with you and with my
[43:17.580 --> 43:23.140]  fellow candidates and I know that people across the country are following us on
[43:23.140 --> 43:30.700]  social media as well by the way you may have seen that I recently launched a
[43:30.700 --> 43:41.820]  snapchat account I love it I love it those messages disappear all by
[43:41.820 --> 43:49.140]  themselves and look at the arrogance if you're not watching us on TV the free
[43:49.140 --> 43:53.740]  feed is at info wars.com forward slash show add some depth to the radio it just
[43:53.740 --> 43:58.780]  augments it and she just has a Joker-esque face I mean she looks more
[43:58.780 --> 44:04.020]  joker-ish than Jack Nicholson in Batman she's a scary witch her actions are a
[44:04.020 --> 44:11.820]  creepy freak now here's Trump on one of the Sunday news shows talking to a
[44:11.820 --> 44:17.500]  Clinton operative and you know here they are discussing it there's a whole bunch
[44:17.500 --> 44:24.700]  of these clips up on info wars.com and prison planet.com I don't even know
[44:24.700 --> 44:29.820]  which one to start with here but let's just go ahead and go to him breaking
[44:29.820 --> 44:34.780]  this down. Republican why is it so hard? Because I'm not prepared to close that
[44:34.780 --> 44:38.540]  door yet but I wouldn't be surprised if someday in the not too distant future
[44:38.540 --> 44:42.900]  it happens they're treating me very well I just want to be treated fairly and you
[44:42.900 --> 44:46.340]  know I'm a person that believes in leverage I'm a natural business person
[44:46.340 --> 44:51.540]  I believe in leverage I would say that it's highly unlikely that I would do
[44:51.540 --> 44:55.780]  it but I just don't want to close that door yet I'm running as a Republican I'm
[44:55.780 --> 45:01.180]  leading as a Republican I will win I think I'm gonna get the nomination and
[45:01.180 --> 45:04.460]  if I get the nomination I think I'll be president and if I'm president we're
[45:04.460 --> 45:07.780]  gonna have a great country and then we will really have better than Reagan
[45:07.780 --> 45:11.540]  better than anybody we will make America great again that's what it's all about.
[45:11.540 --> 45:14.060]  What do you tell conservatives who say you and the Clintons are in cahoots?
[45:14.060 --> 45:17.620]  Well it's totally false first of all nobody's been tougher on Hillary Clinton
[45:17.620 --> 45:21.900]  than me and when Bill Clinton called me I had already made up my decision you
[45:21.900 --> 45:24.980]  know just so you understand he called me long after I had made a decision and
[45:24.980 --> 45:28.620]  everyone knew I was running so it wasn't like that and I think he's very
[45:28.620 --> 45:31.980]  disappointed that I'm running because I'm the one person that's gonna beat her
[45:31.980 --> 45:35.140]  now I think she may not be able to run to be honest because this whole email
[45:35.140 --> 45:38.980]  thing is a horrible thing General Petraeus his life has been destroyed and
[45:38.980 --> 45:44.020]  he did five percent of what she did so assuming she's able to run which would
[45:44.020 --> 45:48.740]  be absolutely to me a miracle at this point I will beat her and I don't see
[45:48.740 --> 45:53.100]  the other people that are running against me currently. You regularly call her the
[45:53.100 --> 45:57.460]  worst secretary of state. I think she's the worst secretary of state in the
[45:57.460 --> 46:00.580]  history of our country look what happened. Well it begs the question I'm a history
[46:00.580 --> 46:03.980]  buff who was the worst before her then in your mind. Well I'll tell you who's the
[46:03.980 --> 46:08.100]  worst after her Kerry because of what I mean. Who do you believe is the worst before her?
[46:08.100 --> 46:11.740]  I don't want to get into names. Well no because that's good. Now here's the next
[46:11.740 --> 46:17.860]  clip where he tells CNN the audio is not that clear but he tells CNN this
[46:17.860 --> 46:21.940]  happened what last Friday that she's got a big problem and it doesn't matter
[46:21.940 --> 46:25.740]  Republicans are trying to score political points because it is what it is.
[46:25.740 --> 46:29.460]  Well the Republicans, Boehner and others aren't doing anything on this. They've
[46:29.460 --> 46:34.300]  been protecting the Clintons that run the Obama White House and allowing them to
[46:34.300 --> 46:40.180]  power grab and giving them political cover on the borders, on war, on funding
[46:40.180 --> 46:49.460]  ISIS, on all of it. Obamacare, you know I want to hear Trump say he wants to
[46:49.460 --> 46:53.860]  repeal Obamacare. I know he wants to cut taxes by 40% and again regardless
[46:53.860 --> 46:58.220]  talking about these issues injects him out there, makes the other candidates talk
[46:58.220 --> 47:03.420]  about it. If he doesn't run third-party
[47:03.420 --> 47:10.220]  and if he stays in he can really win and I guess we're all gonna find out
[47:10.220 --> 47:18.860]  whether he's for real or not. Here's the next clip. But Trump on CNN and then
[47:18.860 --> 47:35.620]  we'll continue here with the transmission today.
[47:48.860 --> 48:15.540]  It doesn't matter because she did it and that's the end of it. And then her
[48:15.540 --> 48:19.100]  response is to be arrogant and make jokes about things disappearing off
[48:19.100 --> 48:23.220]  servers when they've done that with Fast and Furious, IRS, Gate, all of it. Then we
[48:23.220 --> 48:26.780]  finally get some of the emails and it's Lois Lerner talking about how she's
[48:26.780 --> 48:33.580]  gonna go after Republicans. Well of course she did. You gave one tax exemption
[48:33.580 --> 48:37.700]  the last three plus years to a conservative group and over 10,000
[48:37.700 --> 48:42.420]  Democrats. The power to tax is the power to destroy. They're just shutting off
[48:42.420 --> 48:49.500]  their competition. Power plants that aren't on the inside, you're off.
[48:50.940 --> 48:57.340]  Borders open. Special interest running rampant. Special interest exempt from
[48:57.340 --> 49:02.860]  Obamacare. It's outrageous. Now in fairness I'm not normally double-minded
[49:02.860 --> 49:05.660]  about things and I guess that's why they say I've been a successful talk show
[49:05.660 --> 49:09.580]  host is one aspect of it is you got to be clear you got to be concise and not a
[49:09.580 --> 49:14.780]  flip-flopper. And I'm not really a flip-flopper on this. It's just I don't
[49:14.780 --> 49:18.620]  like casinos. You can see some good shows there. It's not that I just like casinos
[49:18.620 --> 49:23.300]  themselves. I think gambling at an industrial level is a chump's game. I
[49:23.300 --> 49:25.900]  mean if you go out to a football game with your friends, want to have a bet,
[49:25.900 --> 49:29.740]  whatever, like to play some poker, you know, fine. It makes the game more
[49:29.740 --> 49:36.620]  interesting. But when you go into these rigged events and you go along with their
[49:36.620 --> 49:41.900]  system, I think it's in a moral business. I'm not judging you. You can do what you
[49:41.900 --> 49:44.540]  want. I'm a libertarian. Doesn't mean I have to agree with it. So that's my
[49:44.540 --> 49:50.300]  biggest problem with Trump and some of his past activities. But we need to hold
[49:50.300 --> 49:54.660]  his feet to the fire and it is pressure. You notice the Obama-Clinton
[49:54.660 --> 49:58.900]  operative Chuck Todd brought up. Hey, conservatives say you might be a plant of
[49:58.900 --> 50:03.020]  the Clintons and so then he goes after Hillary. Well regardless, if we can make
[50:03.020 --> 50:07.380]  Trump who's so popular attack Hillary and it helps give cover to other people to
[50:07.380 --> 50:11.180]  come out and attack her because she's dangerous, then everybody can join in and
[50:11.180 --> 50:16.460]  it's bye-bye Clintons. So I don't care how we get rid of them, they're a danger.
[50:16.460 --> 50:20.540]  They've been attacking the free press forever. It's disgusting. So here's Paul
[50:20.540 --> 50:25.980]  Joseph Watson's breakdown of Donald Trump. The video we're also going to tweet
[50:25.980 --> 50:35.740]  out at real Alex Jones and ask folks their take on Paul Watson's analysis.
[50:35.740 --> 50:41.540]  Here it is. Donald Trump is a stooge for Hillary Clinton. He's a plan. He's a
[50:41.540 --> 50:46.260]  ringer to sink the chances of Republican candidates who actually have a chance of
[50:46.260 --> 50:51.060]  defeating Hillary. We're a bunch of fools and we're being led by a fool. Hillary
[50:51.060 --> 50:55.140]  has already been chosen by the political elite to be the next president.
[50:55.140 --> 51:00.540]  Trump has no chance of defeating Hillary. That's why he's been catapulted to
[51:00.540 --> 51:05.060]  become the front-runner in the GOP race. Shortly before Trump announced his
[51:05.060 --> 51:09.580]  decision to run, he received a mysterious phone call from Bill Clinton. I
[51:09.580 --> 51:13.900]  didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race. Did any of
[51:13.900 --> 51:17.180]  you get a phone call from Bill Clinton? I didn't. Maybe it's because I hadn't
[51:17.180 --> 51:22.020]  given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign. As the
[51:22.020 --> 51:26.100]  Hills Brent Badowski writes, if that phone call was about how Trump could act as
[51:26.100 --> 51:31.540]  a spoiler for the GOP race, Clinton would have told Trump to do everything that
[51:31.540 --> 51:36.780]  he's done since. Personally attacking other GOP candidates, alienating Hispanics,
[51:36.780 --> 51:42.380]  drowning out the message of new and fresh candidates, check, check, check. Now look
[51:42.380 --> 51:46.500]  at the polls. Even at the height of his popularity while Clinton is under FBI
[51:46.500 --> 51:52.700]  investigation, Trump trails Hillary 36 to 48 percent. He's still way behind, whereas
[51:52.700 --> 51:57.020]  other GOP candidates like Scott Walker are tied in a hypothetical head-to-head
[51:57.020 --> 52:01.380]  with Hillary, but they're not going to get a chance to take her on. Until
[52:01.380 --> 52:06.740]  recently, Trump praised the Clintons, his longtime personal friends, every chance
[52:06.740 --> 52:10.340]  he got. Hillary Clinton, I think, is a terrific woman. I mean, I'm a little
[52:10.340 --> 52:14.820]  biased because I've known her for years. You support her? I don't want to get into
[52:14.820 --> 52:19.180]  this because I'll get myself into trouble. But I just like her. I know. I just like
[52:19.180 --> 52:22.940]  her. I like her and I like her husband. Hillary's always surrounded herself with
[52:22.940 --> 52:26.740]  very good people. I think Hillary would do a good job. That's not surprising given
[52:26.740 --> 52:30.700]  his generous donations to Clinton's Senate campaigns and to the Clinton
[52:30.700 --> 52:38.420]  Foundation. Actually, it was vintage Trump, you know. He has been, believe it or not,
[52:38.420 --> 52:43.060]  uncommonly nice to Hillary and me. He thought Hillary was a good senator for
[52:43.060 --> 52:48.220]  New York after 9-11. Right. And he is, actually, he's one of the many Republicans
[52:48.220 --> 52:54.420]  who supported our foundation before they got the memo. Not only has Trump bank
[52:54.420 --> 52:58.620]  rolled Hillary, he's also supported Democrats like Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid
[52:58.620 --> 53:03.300]  and Anthony Weiner, amongst others. Now look at last night's debate. Everyone is
[53:03.300 --> 53:09.220]  attacking Fox News, calling them bias, pervading Trump. Really? Fox just gave
[53:09.220 --> 53:14.180]  Trump the opportunity to do what he does best. Fire back with witty retorts and
[53:14.180 --> 53:19.460]  turn the whole spectacle into the Donald Trump show. Trump got way more talktime
[53:19.460 --> 53:24.540]  than anyone else and more than double the time that Rand Paul got. Trump is the
[53:24.540 --> 53:29.740]  Teflon candidate. His support only increases when he's attacked. Meg and
[53:29.740 --> 53:34.020]  Kelly handing Trump the chance to make politically incorrect statements only
[53:34.020 --> 53:39.780]  boosted his populist street cred. Notice how Fox failed to nail Trump on his key
[53:39.780 --> 53:45.460]  weakness, the fact that he's flip-flops on just about every issue imaginable. Well,
[53:45.460 --> 53:52.220]  I'm very pro-life and I feel strongly about it. I'm very pro-choice. It was
[53:52.220 --> 53:56.620]  left to Carly Fiorina to call Trump out during the earlier debate that hardly
[53:56.620 --> 54:02.260]  anyone even watched. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and
[54:02.260 --> 54:06.060]  on abortion, I would just ask what are the principles by which he will govern.
[54:06.060 --> 54:10.820]  And yes, in many ways Trump is likeable. He's a great public speaker. He makes
[54:10.820 --> 54:15.420]  populist statements that other politicians are afraid to say. But I think
[54:15.420 --> 54:20.220]  we've been down that road before and it didn't turn out so good. Yes, we can.
[54:20.220 --> 54:25.620]  Trump's whole shtick is posing as an anti-establishment candidate, but his cozy
[54:25.620 --> 54:30.500]  relationship with the Clintons clearly suggests he's the opposite of that. And
[54:30.500 --> 54:35.940]  he's serving to eclipse the campaign of the only real anti-establishment candidate
[54:35.940 --> 54:44.620]  in the race, Rand Paul. He buys and sells politicians of all stripes. He's already
[54:44.620 --> 54:49.980]  hedging his bet on the Clintons, okay? So if he doesn't run as a Republican, maybe
[54:49.980 --> 54:54.340]  he supports Clinton or maybe he runs as an independent. Okay. But I'd say that he's
[54:54.340 --> 54:58.260]  already hedging his bets because he's used to buying politician. Well, Trump is
[54:58.260 --> 55:02.620]  also the only candidate who refuses to rule out going third party. Just as
[55:02.620 --> 55:08.340]  Ross Perot's third party run in 1992 ended up helping, you guessed it, the
[55:08.340 --> 55:14.180]  Clintons. The message is clear for conservatives. If you want Hillary Clinton
[55:14.180 --> 55:20.460]  to become the next president, then carry on supporting Donald Trump. How do we let
[55:20.460 --> 55:47.340]  him get away with it, folks?
[55:50.620 --> 55:57.500]  That said, I don't know how he's pro-life. Now, when 10 years ago, he was very
[55:57.500 --> 56:02.780]  pro-choice. See, I believe it. If 10 years ago, he was like, I don't know. I see
[56:02.780 --> 56:06.900]  women's right, but it's also the unborn. We ought to ban partial birth, but keep
[56:06.900 --> 56:10.140]  it until, you know, in the first trimester, then I believe he's become more
[56:10.140 --> 56:17.740]  conservative. He's very slick. He's very confident. And right now, it doesn't
[56:17.740 --> 56:21.940]  really matter because he is piling on, hurting the Clintons and promoting tax
[56:21.940 --> 56:26.740]  cuts. The big question is, will he drop out later or run third party and deliver
[56:26.740 --> 56:33.900]  it to Hillary? Well, will that matter if she's been indicted? And she's being
[56:33.900 --> 56:39.900]  hurt by all this. She's been involved in dozens and dozens of cover-ups, but
[56:39.900 --> 56:45.820]  finally, it's really has an effect. There's more an air of impeachment than
[56:45.820 --> 56:53.540]  there was back when we were trying to impeach Clinton in the late 90s, and
[56:53.540 --> 56:57.220]  people are just so sick of Hillary. They're so sick of the Clintons. They're
[56:57.220 --> 57:01.900]  so sick of the Bushes. This is not the climate to run these dinosaurs. And I
[57:01.900 --> 57:06.140]  think the establishment understands this is not going to fly. So I think there's
[57:06.140 --> 57:09.420]  some major reshuffling going on behind the scenes with the different power
[57:09.420 --> 57:12.540]  grips, and we're going to see some major changes. But I think there's a very good
[57:12.540 --> 57:21.260]  chance that Hillary may recede into the shadows if she's lucky. I think 85, 90%
[57:21.260 --> 57:24.660]  chance this is the end of the Clintons as we know it. We'll find out from Larry
[57:24.660 --> 57:29.060]  Nichols coming up in the next hour. And we'll get into the economy. Huge news on

[1:00:29.660 --> 1:00:35.980]  Videos up on infowars.com. Bob Woodward. Clinton emails remind me of the
[1:00:35.980 --> 1:00:39.140]  Nixon-Tage veteran Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward on Monday
[1:00:39.140 --> 1:00:42.620]  compared the email controversy in Gulfic Democratic presidential candidate
[1:00:42.620 --> 1:00:46.940]  Hillary Clinton to the downfall of President Richard Nixon. On MSNBC's
[1:00:46.940 --> 1:00:51.820]  Morning Joe run by the Clintons, Woodward, who through his reporting help
[1:00:51.820 --> 1:00:57.300]  break open the Watergate scandal, said it at least suspicious the Clinton emails
[1:00:57.300 --> 1:01:02.220]  from her tenure as Secretary of State were wiped away from the server she owned
[1:01:02.220 --> 1:01:05.900]  privately. Really, you think it's suspicious? Follow the trail here, Woodward
[1:01:05.900 --> 1:01:10.100]  said. There are all these emails. Well, they were sent to someone or someone sent
[1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:14.780]  them to her. So if things have been erased here, that's a way to go back to
[1:01:14.780 --> 1:01:19.220]  these emails who received them from Hillary Clinton. So you've got a massive
[1:01:19.220 --> 1:01:23.540]  amount of data in a way. Reminds me of the Nixon-Tage, thousands of hours of
[1:01:23.540 --> 1:01:30.460]  secular recorded conversations that Nixon thought were exclusively his. She is in a
[1:01:30.460 --> 1:01:35.860]  lot of trouble. News broke earlier this year that Clinton relied on a private
[1:01:35.860 --> 1:01:41.100]  email address and server rather than a government-owned one when she served at
[1:01:41.100 --> 1:01:47.620]  the State Department. And that brought down, again, the head of the EPA who was
[1:01:47.620 --> 1:01:53.020]  caught with another separate email and code names just like Hillary. So Hillary
[1:01:53.020 --> 1:01:56.620]  is going the way of the EPA head. Here's the clip.
[1:01:56.620 --> 1:02:01.460]  Allowed to happen in the first place and that they didn't immediately see, we've
[1:02:01.460 --> 1:02:04.100]  been talking about this for a couple of days, they're all asking the same
[1:02:04.100 --> 1:02:09.580]  questions. Why did they allow Hillary Clinton and David Kendall, her lawyer, to
[1:02:09.580 --> 1:02:14.620]  decide whether they were going to turn over those classified information or
[1:02:14.620 --> 1:02:20.540]  not? This is, I think this is unprecedented. Well, it certainly is, but I
[1:02:20.540 --> 1:02:26.460]  mean, follow the trail here. You know, there are all these emails. Well, they
[1:02:26.460 --> 1:02:33.100]  were sent to someone or someone sent them to her. So if things been erased
[1:02:33.100 --> 1:02:41.020]  here, there's a way to go back to who originated these emails or who received
[1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:48.820]  them from Hillary Clinton. So you've got a massive amount of data. It in a way
[1:02:48.820 --> 1:02:55.540]  reminds me of the Nixon tapes. Thousands of hours of secretly recorded
[1:02:55.540 --> 1:03:02.620]  conversations that Nixon thought were exclusively hers. He is that he was not
[1:03:02.620 --> 1:03:07.700]  going to get them. Hillary Clinton initially took that position. I'm not
[1:03:07.700 --> 1:03:11.980]  turning this over. There's going to be no cooperation. Now they're
[1:03:11.980 --> 1:03:21.180]  cooperating, but this is this has to go on a long, long time. And the answers
[1:03:21.180 --> 1:03:25.380]  are probably not going to be pretty. They're not going to be pretty. Yeah, and
[1:03:25.380 --> 1:03:28.140]  they're trying to run the clock until she's president and then can pardon
[1:03:28.140 --> 1:03:33.780]  herself or have Obama do it. They're running the clock. And then they're not
[1:03:33.780 --> 1:03:37.540]  complying though, Woodward. They gave up the servers a year after they were
[1:03:37.540 --> 1:03:46.260]  subpoenaed and then they're wiped. And so the FBI raids and those are wiped. So
[1:03:46.260 --> 1:03:49.660]  that's what's going on. And it's only because the government's being so
[1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:54.220]  embarrassed that it's having to go through the motions and dragging the feet
[1:03:54.220 --> 1:03:58.060]  because this is run by the Clintons. They run the Obama administration.
[1:03:58.060 --> 1:04:02.620]  For all intents and purposes. But there are personalities between the
[1:04:02.620 --> 1:04:07.180]  Clintons, between Trump, between even Boehner, where if Boehner ever got the
[1:04:07.180 --> 1:04:10.540]  political cover where he's not being blackmailed, I think Boehner's probably
[1:04:10.540 --> 1:04:15.500]  not an evil person. I think he's probably mentally ill because I cry ever
[1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:18.500]  once in a while and think about dead family or horrible things that are
[1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:21.740]  happening. But I don't just constantly break down like every time I'm on
[1:04:21.740 --> 1:04:26.500]  camera or half the time. Something's wrong with Boehner. And so we need to have
[1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:31.380]  him removed as the head of the House, the Speaker of the House. We've got that
[1:04:31.380 --> 1:04:34.780]  whole movement we're pushing when Congressman Jones from North Carolina.
[1:04:34.780 --> 1:04:40.060]  Vacate the chair. That video is up on infowars.com as well. Well, the
[1:04:40.060 --> 1:04:43.100]  consummate Clinton Insider, the person the New York Times says Bill Clinton's
[1:04:43.100 --> 1:04:50.460]  afraid of, Larry Nichols battling cancer, lung cancer, joins us on air. Stay
[1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:58.100]  with us. We'll be right back.
[1:04:58.100 --> 1:05:01.660]  You've heard about bootcamps for juvenile delinquents here in the United States.
[1:05:01.660 --> 1:05:05.620]  Well, now a similar system is looking at being installed in the UK. That's right.
[1:05:05.620 --> 1:05:08.660]  Jobless young people will be made to attend bootcamps and return for
[1:05:08.660 --> 1:05:12.620]  benefits as part of a new conservative drive to bring a no-excuse culture to
[1:05:12.620 --> 1:05:15.980]  youth employment. Under the plan, anyone under 21 who is out of work and on
[1:05:15.980 --> 1:05:19.140]  benefits will have to take part in a three-week intensive course to help
[1:05:19.140 --> 1:05:22.700]  them find employment or training. The changes will come into force in April
[1:05:22.700 --> 1:05:25.860]  next year and form part of the government's wider drive to ensure that
[1:05:25.860 --> 1:05:29.580]  all young people are in a job, apprenticeship, traineeship, or unpaid
[1:05:29.580 --> 1:05:33.700]  work experience. Currently, UK's youth unemployment rate is hovering around 15%.
[1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:38.820]  In the United States, it's around 12%. But all the youth need not worry. In 10
[1:05:38.820 --> 1:05:42.900]  years, 130 jobs will be taken over by robots. And since you've been conditioned
[1:05:42.900 --> 1:05:45.860]  to go to camps anytime the government is there to help, Hillary Clinton has an
[1:05:45.860 --> 1:05:52.460]  idea for adults. I have decided we really need camps for adults. That's right. FEMA
[1:05:52.460 --> 1:05:56.420]  camps coming soon to a dystopic future near you. For more reports, go to the

[1:08:56.660 --> 1:09:01.060]  Clinton Chronicles. People were killed that were involved in that film. More
[1:09:01.060 --> 1:09:06.260]  than 150 people were Arkansas-ed in the state of Arkansas or now the state of
[1:09:06.260 --> 1:09:10.300]  Arkansas, as it's known, and the Clinton's medical examiner would certify
[1:09:10.300 --> 1:09:16.620]  people with their arms and legs cut off in trash bags as suicide. Of course,
[1:09:16.620 --> 1:09:22.180]  that's impossible. And he has been warning of what Hillary would do all
[1:09:22.180 --> 1:09:29.100]  along and giving us the inside scoop, LarryNichols.com. He's going to be
[1:09:29.100 --> 1:09:33.300]  joining us. But before we talked to him about could this be the fall of Hillary?
[1:09:33.300 --> 1:09:38.460]  What's he really think about Donald Trump who previously said he loves Hillary? Now
[1:09:38.460 --> 1:09:42.820]  he says she should step down and not run for office. Is he double crossing her? Or
[1:09:42.820 --> 1:09:48.060]  is the fix in to cover up the other candidates? Or he runs third party and
[1:09:48.060 --> 1:09:53.020]  mainly conservatives vote for him because he's Balkanized Democrats and
[1:09:53.020 --> 1:10:00.420]  minorities not to vote for him. And then he delivers 2016 to Hillary. We're going
[1:10:00.420 --> 1:10:04.420]  to find out. I don't know his answer yet, but I respect LarryNichols take. I've
[1:10:04.420 --> 1:10:11.260]  been interviewing LarryNichols since 1996. So LarryNichols joins us here in a
[1:10:11.260 --> 1:10:15.660]  moment. Former state house whistleblower, government insider, service of
[1:10:15.660 --> 1:10:20.460]  political confidant, advisor to Bill Clinton for more than 10 years and help
[1:10:20.460 --> 1:10:23.580]  Bill Clinton get elected and reelected as governor of Arkansas. That's that's
[1:10:23.580 --> 1:10:26.980]  admitted the New York Times that Clinton quote is afraid of LarryNichols. Mr.
[1:10:26.980 --> 1:10:31.860]  Nichols is unrestrained by political correctness and was specifically
[1:10:31.860 --> 1:10:36.180]  mentioned by Bill Clinton in his memoir. And of course he knew well and worked
[1:10:36.180 --> 1:10:43.940]  with a lot of the other big Clinton operatives that are famous as well and
[1:10:43.940 --> 1:10:48.740]  can speak to that whole situation. But before we do that, here's some of
[1:10:48.740 --> 1:10:52.580]  Hillary's arrogance trying to put on the face that she's invincible. Again, here
[1:10:52.580 --> 1:10:56.900]  she is last Friday making jokes about Snapchat that automatically erases the
[1:10:56.900 --> 1:11:02.700]  videos. It's mainly used for folks to send each other, you know, sex videos and
[1:11:02.700 --> 1:11:05.940]  then implying that haha, you know, she erased the emails to which her
[1:11:05.940 --> 1:11:12.140]  constituents praise the Nixonian activity. Here it is. So I am delighted,
[1:11:12.140 --> 1:11:16.900]  delighted to be here with you and with my fellow candidates. And I know that
[1:11:16.900 --> 1:11:23.780]  people across the country are following us on social media as well. By the way,
[1:11:24.380 --> 1:11:34.580]  you may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account. I love it. I
[1:11:34.580 --> 1:11:43.340]  love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves. The Joker smile, the evil
[1:11:43.340 --> 1:11:49.700]  smile could be the cover of a supervillain movie. I mean, she really is a
[1:11:49.700 --> 1:11:54.540]  piece of work. Here she is. A week after they killed Gaddafi and drug him to the
[1:11:54.540 --> 1:11:58.060]  street, the country failed. Al-Qaeda took over. They now admit it's the worst
[1:11:58.060 --> 1:12:02.780]  place in Africa. Women are been enslaved. Tens of thousands of blacks have been
[1:12:02.780 --> 1:12:07.260]  killed by the racist Islamists. And they go, Oh, it was an accident. No, they
[1:12:07.260 --> 1:12:11.220]  wanted to fail the country and break it into multiple parts, which they're now
[1:12:11.220 --> 1:12:16.220]  doing. So here she is bragging about, she came, she saw, she conquered, he died,
[1:12:16.700 --> 1:12:22.180]  quoting Julius Caesar. So I mean, that is the land of unconfirmed. Yes, we came,
[1:12:22.460 --> 1:12:24.220]  we saw, he died.
[1:12:25.980 --> 1:12:30.180]  Do you have anything to do with your visit? I'm sure it did. You know, there's
[1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:35.740]  nothing sicker than a woman that probably couldn't deadlift 100 pounds, bragging
[1:12:35.740 --> 1:12:42.900]  about killing somebody with other foppish, sycophantic women. And I'm not
[1:12:42.900 --> 1:12:48.180]  attacking women themselves, but I know a lot of former special forces, current
[1:12:48.180 --> 1:12:54.860]  special forces, Delta Force, Army Rangers, Navy Shields. I've had a lot of family
[1:12:54.860 --> 1:12:59.860]  in black ops. I've had family that were on international hit teams, stuff like
[1:12:59.860 --> 1:13:05.780]  that. They never talk about any of it. And if they hear somebody and it's
[1:13:05.780 --> 1:13:09.500]  unbecoming when I have flashbacks about fistfights or something, it's not
[1:13:09.500 --> 1:13:12.700]  manly in that circle to just tell stories, but I tell stories about my
[1:13:12.700 --> 1:13:16.180]  experiences all the time. Shocking stuff, funny stuff. I mean, I just what I do, I
[1:13:16.180 --> 1:13:19.620]  tell you what I'm thinking. No teleprompters here just streaming consciousness.
[1:13:20.140 --> 1:13:25.700]  But it's unbecoming even me as a man to shoot my mouth off sometimes. Even though
[1:13:25.700 --> 1:13:28.580]  I'm the first person to have had my butt kicked, I've been in the hospital with
[1:13:28.580 --> 1:13:32.180]  a bone sticking out of my leg. I mean, let me tell you, I could fight and fight
[1:13:32.180 --> 1:13:35.900]  hard. We tell you, a lot of other men can too. So I don't claim to be the baddest
[1:13:35.900 --> 1:13:40.180]  guy around. What I do claim is you get in a fight with me, you're going to get
[1:13:40.180 --> 1:13:47.100]  attacked 110%. So good luck. But to have Hillary Clinton who's done nothing but
[1:13:47.100 --> 1:13:51.980]  order a lot of killings, it's really gross. You know, Larry Nichols has been
[1:13:51.980 --> 1:13:55.180]  in black ops and secret operations for the government. He won't talk about it,
[1:13:55.180 --> 1:13:58.900]  but it's been admitted by the New York Times. I'm sure he won't say anything
[1:13:58.900 --> 1:14:02.660]  about it. To have Hillary constantly bragging about killing people and
[1:14:02.660 --> 1:14:07.820]  constantly laughing like the Joker when the woman can't even probably push her
[1:14:07.820 --> 1:14:17.260]  own grocery cart. It's just so icky and so disgusting to know what a gangster she
[1:14:17.260 --> 1:14:23.420]  is and that she constantly brags about it. And she goes after her political
[1:14:23.420 --> 1:14:29.660]  enemies. And this is just a really unseemly group of people that have never
[1:14:29.660 --> 1:14:37.660]  even gotten their hands dirty. And they are just manifestly archetypally evil.
[1:14:37.660 --> 1:14:43.460]  They're absolutely out of control. And I can't believe this nation is run by them.
[1:14:43.460 --> 1:14:48.260]  What does it say about us and the type of people that the ruling financial
[1:14:48.260 --> 1:14:53.620]  elites want in power, who they can destroy anytime they want? And are we reaching
[1:14:53.620 --> 1:14:57.820]  that point with different power groups getting ready, sick of the Clintons
[1:14:57.820 --> 1:15:02.180]  throwing their weight around, blackmailing powerful people? Are we nearing the end of
[1:15:02.180 --> 1:15:07.020]  Hillary and Bill Clinton? Bill Clinton looks like he's died. I mean, you know,
[1:15:07.020 --> 1:15:10.380]  Larry Nichols has got lung cancer. He's on chemotherapy. He looks pretty
[1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:13.100]  healthy. You can tell he's lost a lot of weight. We're about to go to him in
[1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:20.620]  video Skype. You can watch it at infowars.com forward slash show. But sitting
[1:15:20.620 --> 1:15:25.140]  here looking at Clinton play golf last weekend at Martha's Vineyard, he looks
[1:15:25.140 --> 1:15:30.020]  like a reanimated corpse show. Does the system know that the fall of the
[1:15:30.020 --> 1:15:34.660]  Clintons is upon us? Could that great day be actually here? And I'll tell you, I
[1:15:34.660 --> 1:15:37.860]  got some self-interest in this. They've tried to kill Larry Nichols. They've
[1:15:37.860 --> 1:15:40.580]  killed a bunch of people in Arkansas, including folks that were in the film.
[1:15:40.580 --> 1:15:46.420]  The Clinton Chronicles one and two. Bottom got beat up. You name it. I'm on
[1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:49.740]  their enemies list. I've been messed with by the Clintons, specifically on
[1:15:49.740 --> 1:15:52.260]  Waco. And I was getting physically attacked by five guys once in a
[1:15:52.260 --> 1:15:56.900]  parking lot. They said, shut up about Waco and the Clintons. I was fired from
[1:15:56.900 --> 1:16:01.100]  my first big hit radio job, number one in the city. I was told, stop talking about
[1:16:01.100 --> 1:16:06.260]  the Clintons. And I wouldn't. They said, you're fired. And they were told, do not
[1:16:06.260 --> 1:16:11.060]  talk about the Clintons. So they, I'm sick of these bullies is what I'm getting
[1:16:11.060 --> 1:16:14.900]  at. Larry, I'm ranting larrynichols.com. Thank you for joining us for the first
[1:16:14.900 --> 1:16:18.820]  time via video Skype. Good to have you. Hope you get better buddy. We're praying
[1:16:18.820 --> 1:16:21.980]  for you. You heard my whole rant about Hillary. What do you have to say about
[1:16:21.980 --> 1:16:27.020]  that? And are we at the point of the fall of the Clintons? Well, first off, you
[1:16:27.020 --> 1:16:31.100]  pointed out lung cancer and that'll sick them on me big time, but we'll leave it
[1:16:31.100 --> 1:16:34.940]  at not quite lung cancer, but whatever they're going to come at me anyway they
[1:16:34.940 --> 1:16:40.180]  can. And we've been trying to keep it kind of down. But let me tell you something
[1:16:40.180 --> 1:16:45.020]  Alex, these people will get you. You know they will. I don't have to tell you.
[1:16:45.020 --> 1:16:48.780]  Good Lord. I get what you're saying. That'll be clear. If you already are sick,
[1:16:48.780 --> 1:16:52.140]  then they can whack you and claim you just out of that. Exactly. That's right.
[1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:55.700]  That gives them a legitimate way for me just to disappear and say, Oh, bless
[1:16:55.700 --> 1:16:59.860]  his heart. He, you know, you just have to be careful with these guys. If you know
[1:16:59.860 --> 1:17:05.260]  what I know, Alex, the list goes on and on. People don't realize it, but let's
[1:17:05.260 --> 1:17:12.620]  see the guy, the cameraman for the Clinton Chronicle, dead, 50 some odd
[1:17:12.620 --> 1:17:16.940]  people that I worked with that were fixing to testify against Hillary in
[1:17:16.940 --> 1:17:22.500]  court for whitewater dead. I mean, you're talking about guys that get up on the
[1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:26.660]  roof. I think it's in Kansas City, get up on the roof, jump off the roof and
[1:17:26.660 --> 1:17:31.460]  kill yourself, which is fine. I can live with that. The problem is you couldn't
[1:17:31.460 --> 1:17:36.540]  get through that door except from the outside. How did he do it? So it's
[1:17:36.540 --> 1:17:40.940]  loaded with that kind of stuff. Now, I guess more importantly today, what's
[1:17:40.940 --> 1:17:46.740]  going on with Hillary? I'm one of two things that's happening, Alex, right
[1:17:46.740 --> 1:17:54.020]  now. Either Hillary and her campaign with Bill, they're either getting this
[1:17:54.020 --> 1:17:59.620]  stuff out now on purpose, because one of the rules we have when you run for
[1:17:59.620 --> 1:18:04.420]  office, Alex, is you've got to be the underdog. Of course, she screwed up the
[1:18:04.420 --> 1:18:09.580]  last time running against Obama. She came in as this anointed one that was
[1:18:09.580 --> 1:18:15.620]  going to be guaranteed to get it. That's against the system. This time she's
[1:18:15.620 --> 1:18:19.100]  doing it right. This time she went out, she cleared the field. You're going to
[1:18:19.100 --> 1:18:22.860]  notice there's nobody running against her except what's his name, the
[1:18:22.860 --> 1:18:28.780]  socialist. She drew down all the money out there, so if somebody does get in,
[1:18:28.780 --> 1:18:34.140]  where are they going to get the money? She's playing the system exactly. Now, at
[1:18:34.140 --> 1:18:39.220]  this point, I want to tell you, one of two things is going on. Alex, either this
[1:18:39.220 --> 1:18:43.940]  is the Clintons getting this out so that she becomes one of the underdogs, which
[1:18:43.940 --> 1:18:50.940]  she has to do to win, or two, she's got Obama. Remember what we said
[1:18:50.940 --> 1:18:54.460]  last time, Alex, the best friends we got in this country are Bill and Hillary
[1:18:54.460 --> 1:18:59.740]  Clinton right now, because as you know, Obama would love nothing better than to
[1:18:59.740 --> 1:19:06.180]  have some riots all around the country. Then he gets to bring in and kick in
[1:19:06.180 --> 1:19:11.500]  the FEMA provisional government, which we know to be martial law, and then he's
[1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:15.820]  king. Well, there's only two people powerful enough to stop him, and that's
[1:19:15.820 --> 1:19:21.860]  Bill and Hillary. So I wonder if this new impetus that's being put on these
[1:19:21.860 --> 1:19:27.460]  emails is coming from Obama to take them out of the game. And I guess there is a
[1:19:27.460 --> 1:19:31.820]  third one, all of this that we're seeing might be real. It'll be the first time
[1:19:31.820 --> 1:19:35.460]  we've seen anything having to do with the Clintons or national politics, it's
[1:19:35.460 --> 1:19:42.580]  real. So that's where we stand, but I can assure you that I don't believe the
[1:19:42.580 --> 1:19:48.980]  emails will get Hillary. As I understand, correct me if I'm wrong, Alex, I think the
[1:19:48.980 --> 1:19:53.940]  emails that they have found that have been top secret are not slated top
[1:19:53.940 --> 1:20:00.500]  secret on her server. Now, if that's the case, if they don't say top secret, she's
[1:20:00.500 --> 1:20:06.300]  held harmless. Prove anything you want, you're not gonna get her. But we've got
[1:20:06.300 --> 1:20:12.140]  something that I gave you, which is probably not a favor to you, but we've
[1:20:12.140 --> 1:20:19.860]  got a document that I have, the original of, that will get her and get her bad,
[1:20:19.860 --> 1:20:24.020]  and it's going to be broken today. We're gonna put it out, I hope, if you
[1:20:24.020 --> 1:20:30.660]  choose to. Yes, we have. It's the memo on Vince Foster. It is indeed. Now, folks,
[1:20:30.660 --> 1:20:36.500]  what that memo says, and I know it's hard to read, the bottom line to that memo,
[1:20:36.500 --> 1:20:44.380]  it said, the body of Vincent Foster, White House Chief Counsel, was found in
[1:20:44.380 --> 1:20:52.100]  his car in the Fort Morrissey Park parking lot, with a wound to his head.
[1:20:52.100 --> 1:20:58.220]  38 caliber Rebaba was found in the car with him, along with a six-pack of
[1:20:58.220 --> 1:21:02.380]  Bartlett and James Winecooners, of which he had drank one. The others were not
[1:21:02.380 --> 1:21:10.780]  open. Then it also says in the back seat, the Magic Briefcase is there. Now, guys,
[1:21:10.780 --> 1:21:15.460]  see that number bottom right down there? What is that? Alex, I can't see from here
[1:21:15.460 --> 1:21:21.780]  that 620. Oh, yes. Well, no, I'm sorry. Look at the top of this. Look at the top
[1:21:21.780 --> 1:21:30.220]  of it, 2551. There it is. Now, folks, that means this document right here, I place
[1:21:30.220 --> 1:21:34.700]  that in Kenneth Starr's evidentiary file. There it is. That's the official
[1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:42.380]  evidentiary stamp. Now, how did this, Alex, go and talked about? I mean, we're not
[1:21:42.380 --> 1:21:46.780]  talking, Alex, about a typo here. Look at that. It speaks with
[1:21:46.780 --> 1:21:54.180]  specificity. This Foster, they say, the park police, and they told the Secret
[1:21:54.180 --> 1:21:59.180]  Service at the White House. This is the first notification to the Secret Service
[1:21:59.180 --> 1:22:04.860]  that Vince Foster had been found. The story, as we're told, is he walked, got out
[1:22:04.860 --> 1:22:10.620]  of his car in that parking lot, walked 200 yards on a dirt trail, went to a burn,
[1:22:10.620 --> 1:22:15.980]  sat down by a Civil War cannon, stuck a pistol in his mouth, and shot himself in
[1:22:15.980 --> 1:22:21.980]  the head. Now, when you look at the autopsy, it's odd. You know, Alex, that man
[1:22:21.980 --> 1:22:27.420]  walked 200 yards on a dirt trail in the heart of July, and didn't get a
[1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:34.860]  microscopic speck of dust on his shoes, pants, socks, belt, nowhere. The only
[1:22:34.860 --> 1:22:42.540]  thing, the only thing they found on him were multi-color, long, shag carpet
[1:22:42.540 --> 1:22:48.700]  fibers. Why is this important? I guess the audience is wondering, this is old news,
[1:22:48.700 --> 1:22:56.460]  Vince Foster's dead. Well, no, no. Right there, Alex, you have in your hand the
[1:22:56.460 --> 1:23:01.340]  evidence that Hillary's been afraid of. That's why they're afraid of me. And
[1:23:01.340 --> 1:23:04.780]  that's why they told the New York Times they're afraid of you. Is this the
[1:23:04.780 --> 1:23:10.700]  first time the Secret Service memo has been seen? Yes, sir. I weighed it and held
[1:23:10.700 --> 1:23:14.860]  it out here. The National Enquirer was going to do a story on it, but I kept
[1:23:14.860 --> 1:23:20.140]  holding them down. This is it. This is where it comes right here. And Alex, how
[1:23:20.140 --> 1:23:23.900]  were you able to get this and give this to the special prosecutor from the
[1:23:23.900 --> 1:23:31.340]  Clinton impeachment? I stole it. I just stole it. I stole it from the FBI guys that
[1:23:31.340 --> 1:23:36.860]  had got it. And I got it before Star did, and I put it in the file. That's the
[1:23:36.860 --> 1:23:40.620]  real deal. There's nothing fake about that, folks. You can go and grab it. Now, you're
[1:23:40.620 --> 1:23:46.380]  covering for the FBI agents, aren't you? You were given this memo. Yeah. Well, let me
[1:23:46.380 --> 1:23:51.420]  take that back because I don't get them in trouble. My mailbox got that. Just one
[1:23:51.420 --> 1:23:57.580]  day I woke up and there was a mailbox of mine and that was in it, along with a
[1:23:57.580 --> 1:24:03.580]  whole bunch of other documents. Alex, when we get through, you and I, if you want
[1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:09.580]  to call a cause, this stuff's important because there's no statute of limitations
[1:24:09.580 --> 1:24:13.020]  on murder. Now, dump it all. We've already gotten enough trouble. You might as well
[1:24:13.020 --> 1:24:18.540]  sign our John Hancock's big. I'm going to dump it all. I'm going to dump it right
[1:24:18.540 --> 1:24:24.460]  here, but I hope y'all forgive me for one little thing. With all the pain, the
[1:24:24.460 --> 1:24:28.700]  Clintons have called people, called people, with all the lying and all the
[1:24:28.700 --> 1:24:32.300]  hurting and all the people. Now, remember, I'm not saying Bill and Hillary have
[1:24:32.300 --> 1:24:38.300]  killed souls, not them. I'm not saying they've even ordered it, but I do know
[1:24:39.020 --> 1:24:43.900]  as to you, Alex, more people died around Bill and Hillary Clinton than any other
[1:24:43.900 --> 1:24:49.820]  president in history, in history, even in wartime presidents.
[1:24:49.820 --> 1:24:54.060]  And she just announced she's running. What do you find, Alex? You find their
[1:24:54.060 --> 1:25:03.420]  chef back in that day, goes to New Mexico, goes on a hike, then they find him
[1:25:03.420 --> 1:25:11.100]  drowned, starting all over again. And they're tying up Lucins, Larry Nichols,
[1:25:11.100 --> 1:25:15.100]  big-time Clinton insider, the guy behind the Clinton Chronicles, all the big
[1:25:15.100 --> 1:25:19.820]  stories, and the guy that they just said last year they're afraid of, obviously,
[1:25:19.820 --> 1:25:22.780]  and we need to pray for him because he is on chemotherapy. You might have
[1:25:22.780 --> 1:25:25.660]  forgotten. You did kind of halfway announce it last time you were on, so I
[1:25:25.660 --> 1:25:29.500]  wasn't. No, but I understand you don't want to talk about how sick you are, but
[1:25:29.500 --> 1:25:32.700]  you look pretty good. We're praying for you, buddy. But I want to shift ears back
[1:25:32.700 --> 1:25:37.660]  to her, then. Why does she love to brag about killing people? I mean, you heard
[1:25:37.660 --> 1:25:40.220]  me make the whole point about how unseemly that is. Before we go back into
[1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:45.100]  Vince Foster, the three points. Trump could be for real. This could all be
[1:25:45.100 --> 1:25:48.140]  really happening. The country's fed up. The power structure is sick of the
[1:25:48.140 --> 1:25:51.820]  Clintons. Even Bob Woolworth's come out and said it looks like, you know, Nixon.
[1:25:52.700 --> 1:25:58.540]  Or, and I thought of this too, but never said it on air, this could be Obama
[1:25:59.180 --> 1:26:03.660]  getting rid of his political controllers so he can go for the big power grab
[1:26:04.620 --> 1:26:08.780]  instead of letting them have their shot. And it could be the camp that backs
[1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:13.100]  Obama. And he has been double crossing with the Islamists, the Saudi
[1:26:13.100 --> 1:26:18.780]  Arabians. He clearly has a bigger power play here, like nothing I've ever seen.
[1:26:18.780 --> 1:26:22.700]  And so could he be planning something and not pardon the Clintons? Could he be
[1:26:23.420 --> 1:26:29.740]  getting ready to set them up? You know, Alex, I've feared this since day one.
[1:26:29.740 --> 1:26:34.540]  You know, we're at a point in history with the United States of America.
[1:26:34.540 --> 1:26:37.340]  We're in the end game. So they're going to start stabbing each other in the back.
[1:26:37.340 --> 1:26:44.060]  That's right. And everybody is buying to be the last president, the last president,
[1:26:44.060 --> 1:26:51.260]  because then when this country falls, the last president becomes essentially a king.
[1:26:52.220 --> 1:26:56.780]  The FEMA provisional government, which you've talked about, Alex, for years.
[1:26:56.780 --> 1:26:59.900]  And by the way, Putin's done that. He's the last president in Russia.
[1:26:59.900 --> 1:27:07.020]  He is. So what they're doing is we're in a power struggle for the one that's going to be the
[1:27:07.020 --> 1:27:14.300]  last president who then therefore becomes king, virtually the Euro style, 16th century type
[1:27:14.300 --> 1:27:22.780]  government. And so yeah, that's why I think about Obama. Of course, under he, he knows what I know.
[1:27:22.780 --> 1:27:30.940]  He knows Bill and Hillary will move on him, stop him if they can. And I believe he wants it.
[1:27:30.940 --> 1:27:36.940]  And I believe Obama is moving to take over this country, be king. And the minute he gets
[1:27:36.940 --> 1:27:42.220]  it, Alex, this is conjecture on my part. But I believe the minute he gets that,
[1:27:42.220 --> 1:27:47.100]  what's going to happen is he's going to open up and say, I'm really a Muslim and we are now
[1:27:47.100 --> 1:27:53.900]  an Islamic caliphate. Then let me stand on that. Could Trump be working for Obama
[1:27:54.700 --> 1:28:00.220]  to knock out Hillary and to basically get all this prepared and shut up?
[1:28:00.220 --> 1:28:07.980]  I think in my way of looking, there's two things Trump can be doing. Number one,
[1:28:08.620 --> 1:28:17.260]  he can be a ringer for Hillary. He is following eerily exactly the pattern they used with Ross
[1:28:17.260 --> 1:28:23.900]  Perot. And I've got the state troopers that were Clinton security guards of that day,
[1:28:23.900 --> 1:28:30.460]  and they talk and have gone public telling that every day Bill Clinton and Ross Perot talked
[1:28:30.460 --> 1:28:35.500]  when they were supposedly running against each other. So he could be setting Hillary up.
[1:28:36.540 --> 1:28:43.580]  Well, you know what? He could be real. He could be real. And I guess you could look at the third
[1:28:43.580 --> 1:28:50.380]  that he might be working for Obama, but I've never heard Trump in anything that I can recall.
[1:28:50.380 --> 1:28:55.500]  Maybe you have. I haven't heard anything he said that I can recall that would ingratiate
[1:28:55.500 --> 1:29:00.220]  him with Obama. No, I agree with you, except he helped push the whole Kenya birth certificate
[1:29:00.220 --> 1:29:05.260]  deal when we actually knew he's the son of Frank Marshall Davis. And that whole story they wanted
[1:29:05.260 --> 1:29:10.700]  us to say was from Kenya is why they said when he was the head of the Harvard Law Review that he
[1:29:10.700 --> 1:29:15.420]  was born there, his wife said in speeches, they put out a fake birth certificate on purpose,
[1:29:15.420 --> 1:29:20.460]  we buy it. Trump pushes the birth certificate. And the truth is he's the son of a famous communist
[1:29:20.460 --> 1:29:25.740]  pornographer who he admits he lived with as a kid. I mean, it's just you see how these
[1:29:25.740 --> 1:29:30.940]  intelligence operatives operate. Bottom line, things are shaking up big time. Larry Nichols is
[1:29:30.940 --> 1:29:37.340]  going to give you the data dump on what was really in the impeachment of Clinton round one. And is
[1:29:37.340 --> 1:29:43.020]  this the fall of the Clintons or a power struggle between Obama and the Clintons or could Trump
[1:29:43.020 --> 1:29:49.260]  be working for Jeb Bush? Who knows, we got to look at every angle. We're on the march,
[1:29:49.260 --> 1:30:14.620]  the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[1:32:55.500 --> 1:33:05.100]  and I salute you, our supporters. You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth. A lie. No man is obsolete. You have
[1:33:05.100 --> 1:33:10.780]  no function, Mr. Wordsworth. You're an anachronism like a ghost from another time. I am nothing more
[1:33:10.780 --> 1:33:17.100]  than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages. You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth,
[1:33:17.100 --> 1:33:23.340]  a crawling insect, an ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning. I
[1:33:23.340 --> 1:33:29.820]  am a human being. You're a librarian, Mr. Wordsworth. You're a dealer in books and two-cent
[1:33:29.820 --> 1:33:35.180]  finds and pamphlets and closed stacks on the musty insides of a language factory that spews
[1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:42.380]  out meaningless words on an assembly line. Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no
[1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:48.220]  dimension, like air, like the wind, like a vacuum that you may believe has an existence by
[1:33:48.220 --> 1:33:54.620]  scribbling index numbers on little cards. I don't care. I tell you, I don't care. I'm a human being.
[1:33:54.620 --> 1:34:01.660]  I exist. And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my
[1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:10.300]  grave. Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth, delusions that you inject into your veins with printer's ink,
[1:34:10.300 --> 1:34:17.580]  the narcotics that you call literature, the Bible, poetry, essays of all kind, all of it,
[1:34:17.580 --> 1:34:23.180]  and opiates to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all. You have nothing
[1:34:23.180 --> 1:34:28.060]  but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind.
[1:34:34.300 --> 1:34:38.060]  You'll waste our time, Mr. Wordsworth, and you're not worth the waste.
[1:34:38.060 --> 1:34:53.980]  Instruct him. Romney Wordsworth, step back to await the finding of this board. Yes, sir.
[1:34:53.980 --> 1:34:55.820]  How do you find, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:34:55.820 --> 1:35:06.620]  Obsolete. Obsolete. Obsolete. Obsolete. I concur. Romney Wordsworth, step forward.
[1:35:09.820 --> 1:35:12.460]  The board finds you obsolete.
[1:35:12.460 --> 1:35:27.980]  The truth is the words we speak do go on forever as long as humans keep records of it,
[1:35:27.980 --> 1:35:33.580]  and that's our connection to the past and the future. Larry Nichols is our guest.
[1:35:35.020 --> 1:35:39.580]  That was not a mistake earlier, and Larry's agreed that I can talk about it.
[1:35:39.580 --> 1:35:44.220]  And I want to talk about, especially so you can get some real support and try to stay alive longer,
[1:35:44.220 --> 1:35:48.380]  because he's exhausted his estate. He is battling lung cancer, same thing killed his dad.
[1:35:49.020 --> 1:35:53.020]  He said he knows they can kill him in the hospital. They've tried to kill him before.
[1:35:53.580 --> 1:35:56.300]  He says every time they come in with the injections, he puckers.
[1:35:57.500 --> 1:36:01.100]  He is, you know what, hoping that it didn't his last, because they love to do that.
[1:36:01.100 --> 1:36:04.220]  Look, they already have databases. They already know what's wrong with him.
[1:36:04.220 --> 1:36:08.860]  It came out last time briefly, and so I think it's more important than ever we pray for Larry
[1:36:08.860 --> 1:36:12.460]  Nichols, and he didn't ask us to do this, but I'm going to do it. Let's put up his P.O. Box
[1:36:13.340 --> 1:36:19.180]  here on screen whenever we get a chance, and we will give people that P.O. Box
[1:36:20.060 --> 1:36:25.580]  so that you can donate to him so he gets some good medical care. He lost his career so much more
[1:36:25.580 --> 1:36:29.100]  when he was at the heights of state government working with the Clintons, because he wouldn't
[1:36:29.100 --> 1:36:36.620]  be part of the narcotics trafficking. So when we do get that P.O. Box up on screen, I will give you
[1:36:36.620 --> 1:36:49.980]  that address so that you can do that, but it is so important that we stand up and that we support
[1:36:51.980 --> 1:36:58.700]  folks that have told the truth, that have taken action. And again, we'll put it on screen for
[1:36:58.700 --> 1:37:03.980]  TV viewers later in the broadcast. I can bring Larry Nichols up, and he can verbally give us
[1:37:03.980 --> 1:37:08.700]  his address on air so that he can get some treatment. He does have
[1:37:11.500 --> 1:37:15.340]  cancer, advanced cancer, and we just want to pray for him and keep him alive as long as possible,
[1:37:15.340 --> 1:37:20.620]  and good medical care could do that. Larry, I mean, it's out there, so we should get out there
[1:37:20.620 --> 1:37:24.220]  all the way, because I agree with you, it's dangerous obviously, but we need to get it out
[1:37:24.220 --> 1:37:29.900]  there. What is your P.O. Box for folks that want to support you? I don't have the P.O. Box. I've
[1:37:29.900 --> 1:37:41.100]  got my address, number 28, Kensington Drive, Conway, Arkansas, 72034. And the cause of your
[1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:47.660]  program, I had a PayPal thing set up. I don't know much about it, but you can go to PayPal,
[1:37:47.660 --> 1:37:56.540]  and it's NicholsLive at AOL.com. And Alex, you know, I don't need anybody thinking that what I'm
[1:37:56.540 --> 1:38:00.780]  saying is just about money. I know you never even asked for it, and then when you were on a few
[1:38:00.780 --> 1:38:05.420]  months ago, I said, how are you doing? You said I'm broke, I got cancer, same way my dad went,
[1:38:06.300 --> 1:38:09.900]  and I just want to be able to live long enough to try to see these people go down.
[1:38:09.900 --> 1:38:13.980]  And so I said, let's put your home address out or your address so folks can support you.
[1:38:13.980 --> 1:38:18.540]  Then I told you you should get a PayPal so you can get, you know, better donations that way. People
[1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:25.500]  can go to LarryNichols.com and link through on there and find your address and more, LarryNichols.com.
[1:38:25.500 --> 1:38:29.180]  Now I want to do the data dump here on the Clintons. That's really important,
[1:38:29.180 --> 1:38:34.380]  but I appreciate your courage to talk about this. But do you want to tell folks medically where you're
[1:38:34.380 --> 1:38:41.820]  at? No, not really, but I'll say this, folks, please don't worry. I'll be alive long enough,
[1:38:41.820 --> 1:38:48.380]  Alex, to get them. I know they don't want to hear that, but you've got my word, folks. I'm not going
[1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:56.540]  anywhere, nowhere, until we stop this madness. What about Bill? How does he look to you?
[1:38:58.300 --> 1:39:03.500]  Like you said, death won't over. I mean, I know I look hollowed out and I know I look bad,
[1:39:04.060 --> 1:39:12.620]  but my God, Bill looks like he's already been dead. And you're exactly right, but we will stay the
[1:39:12.620 --> 1:39:18.460]  course. This is coming. And the thing about the documents that we're going to be laying out to
[1:39:18.460 --> 1:39:23.980]  you, Alex, this stuff's real, this stuff, they can't get rid of it. We've got this evidence.
[1:39:23.980 --> 1:39:31.100]  And like I said, like I said, guys, there's no statute of limitation on murder and suicide is
[1:39:31.100 --> 1:39:37.420]  a murder. The reason it got covered up in the first place, folks. So, you know, why would they go
[1:39:37.420 --> 1:39:43.980]  to the trouble to move the body, even if he did kill himself? It's because had they not have moved
[1:39:43.980 --> 1:39:54.300]  his body, where he died would have fallen under the DC police and they would have surely have gotten
[1:39:54.300 --> 1:40:02.300]  to the part that Hillary and Bill, Hillary and Vince had a long standing affair. And had that
[1:40:02.300 --> 1:40:08.300]  have come out, then Hillary wouldn't be running for president now. They had to cover it up and
[1:40:08.300 --> 1:40:13.980]  they had to move it into the park police jurisdiction, which gave them the cover.
[1:40:14.700 --> 1:40:19.820]  Sure. The Clintons were about to fall because of all this in 95. And then magically Oklahoma City
[1:40:19.820 --> 1:40:24.220]  took place right next door to your state in Oklahoma. And Clinton told on Air Force One,
[1:40:24.220 --> 1:40:28.460]  the whole press corps, you know, one year later that he owed his reelection to Oklahoma City.
[1:40:28.460 --> 1:40:34.380]  Like you're talking, let me go let that damn dog out or you're not going to hear me at all.
[1:40:34.380 --> 1:40:37.820]  I understand. Go ahead. Hey, bring the dog on screen. We want to see it.
[1:40:37.820 --> 1:40:42.620]  He's an English bulldog and he's stubborn. He kind of, he's kind of like his master,
[1:40:42.620 --> 1:40:46.220]  little bit of a stubborn bulldog. All right, I'll be right.
[1:40:46.780 --> 1:40:51.820]  All right. All right. He just unplugged his mic. What a character Larry Nichols is.
[1:40:51.820 --> 1:40:54.940]  We are going to send a crew up there to interview Larry Nichols. I've been a little
[1:40:54.940 --> 1:41:03.900]  short of manpower, but I do want to send Josh Owens and Jakari Jackson or whoever else wants to go
[1:41:04.460 --> 1:41:09.820]  up to Arkansas to interview Larry Nichols. That needs to happen sooner rather than later.
[1:41:09.820 --> 1:41:13.740]  And again, I wasn't throwing him under the bus folks. He had mentioned the cancer,
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:21.500]  said it last time he was on just, and then once it started coming out, I'm like, Larry,
[1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:26.700]  you got to go ahead and just say it all. And he's like, yeah, but the Clintons will know.
[1:41:26.700 --> 1:41:31.980]  I mean, obviously the Clintons already know. That was embarrassing.
[1:41:32.380 --> 1:41:36.620]  That is not, it's real radio. It makes it even better slash TV. Okay. In the 20 minutes we've
[1:41:36.620 --> 1:41:41.100]  got left for 25 minutes. I'll hold you into the next segment after that. Let's get into
[1:41:41.100 --> 1:41:47.180]  the data dump. I mean, this is a big deal that, that the prosecution of Clinton in the house and
[1:41:47.180 --> 1:41:51.980]  the Senate, well, they voted to start the investigation and the trial in the Senate in the house.
[1:41:51.980 --> 1:41:56.460]  And then you have the fact that Vince Foster's in the car. They've obviously had the park police
[1:41:56.460 --> 1:42:01.900]  and others dragging him off. Why were they trying to cover that up? And how could they cover it up?
[1:42:01.900 --> 1:42:09.180]  It's so obvious. Well, again, the reason they covered it up was simply to keep the fact that
[1:42:09.180 --> 1:42:17.180]  Hillary would be then, if they'd have stayed in the DC police, there is no doubt the affair between
[1:42:17.180 --> 1:42:23.020]  Vince and Hillary would come up as a mitigating circumstance. That would have meant Hillary
[1:42:23.020 --> 1:42:30.620]  would have been the first, first lady in history to be caught having an affair. Now today, Alex,
[1:42:30.620 --> 1:42:36.700]  that might not have that kind of impact, but it would have been devastating back then. You know,
[1:42:36.700 --> 1:42:42.540]  we've dropped so far in our morals that I don't even know what matters now, but I promise you that
[1:42:42.540 --> 1:42:49.580]  would have been devastating then. And so what they're doing is they're trying to keep that under
[1:42:49.580 --> 1:42:56.460]  the cover. That's why they're afraid of me. They know what I've got. Let me give another example
[1:42:56.460 --> 1:43:04.140]  of what I possess. The autopsy report. The autopsy report. The autopsy report, folks,
[1:43:04.140 --> 1:43:11.100]  guarantees you metaphysically that Vince Foster didn't die the way they said he did.
[1:43:11.660 --> 1:43:17.100]  When they, when the medical examiner went over and did the autopsy, they found whole
[1:43:17.100 --> 1:43:24.620]  meat and potatoes in his stomach. And I don't mean to be gross. That's significant because
[1:43:25.740 --> 1:43:31.020]  it takes three hours approximately, and I don't mean approximately like it could be five hours.
[1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:38.060]  I mean, it's three hours, maybe three and a half hours tops, but the body turns whole food
[1:43:38.060 --> 1:43:43.180]  into a liquid form. And that's how it's digested and sent through the system.
[1:43:44.140 --> 1:43:50.300]  So we know from Linda Tripp that she got him a hamburger and french fries,
[1:43:51.100 --> 1:43:57.660]  and he took it from her between 1215 and 1230. So if you extrapolate,
[1:43:57.660 --> 1:44:09.500]  that means he had to have died. His, his life had to have ended before 3 or 3.30 in the afternoon.
[1:44:10.220 --> 1:44:20.460]  It was 94 to 96 degrees that day in Washington. Now imagine, and he didn't get found by the way,
[1:44:20.460 --> 1:44:28.140]  folks, until 615, 615 is the first time the medical examiner's laid eyes on him. And they made two
[1:44:28.140 --> 1:44:34.940]  comments that were significant. They said, well, he didn't look dead. You know, he didn't look dead.
[1:44:34.940 --> 1:44:41.580]  Well, let me tell you, anybody that has seen Roadkill on the highway will know. If you lay out
[1:44:41.580 --> 1:44:48.300]  in the hot sun for three hours, it's going to be bloated city. It's going to blow up the gases
[1:44:48.300 --> 1:44:55.820]  you're going to build up. They didn't in him. The next thing they said, which is really weird,
[1:44:55.820 --> 1:45:00.540]  they said they put their hands in his pocket looking for the car keys.
[1:45:01.820 --> 1:45:07.580]  As you can imagine, somebody that been out there in that hot sun, you couldn't,
[1:45:07.580 --> 1:45:12.060]  it looked like his britches are painted on him. You're not going to get your hands in his pocket.
[1:45:12.060 --> 1:45:20.460]  Now, they also, and this is the first responders, they said there was no blood at the scene.
[1:45:22.060 --> 1:45:26.540]  There was just a little trickle coming out his nose and went down on his shirt pocket.
[1:45:27.900 --> 1:45:34.300]  Well, Alex, you've been around. I know you have seen head wounds in suicide. It's not
[1:45:34.300 --> 1:45:39.980]  a pleasant thing to see. But one thing that happens when you receive a head wound like that,
[1:45:39.980 --> 1:45:48.220]  there is a lot of blood. There was no blood on the ground. They didn't find anything.
[1:45:49.020 --> 1:45:53.180]  It looked like he had just fallen asleep. Well, I mean, clearly they covered up what really
[1:45:53.180 --> 1:45:56.300]  happened to him. Do you believe he committed suicide or was murdered? If he just committed
[1:45:56.300 --> 1:46:02.300]  suicide, why covered it up? Well, the reason to cover it up was to keep that from getting out
[1:46:02.300 --> 1:46:05.900]  about the affair. That's all it was. You know, when I was with Bill,
[1:46:05.900 --> 1:46:12.540]  you know, that was one of the problems we always had. We could take something that looks bad,
[1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:17.660]  but if you just leave it alone now, it's going to go away. But we always had a problem of Bill
[1:46:17.660 --> 1:46:22.220]  forcing it. They were so busy trying to cover stuff up that they'd make it worse.
[1:46:22.940 --> 1:46:29.100]  They should have left it alone. The reason they didn't is because a man named Eric Laskock found
[1:46:29.100 --> 1:46:36.700]  out from me and we found out that Vince Foster and Larry Wallace, an attorney here in Arkansas,
[1:46:36.700 --> 1:46:43.100]  a big friend of Bill's, and with Vince, they had rented a house from the old Louisiana
[1:46:43.100 --> 1:46:48.620]  senator who had retired. He still had the house. They rented that for a cat house
[1:46:49.260 --> 1:46:56.060]  for Bill to slip away from the White House and have his parties. Now, that house, if you walked
[1:46:56.060 --> 1:47:01.660]  out on the back porch and you threw a rock, if you could throw a rock a hundred yards, you'd hit
[1:47:01.660 --> 1:47:09.100]  the burn where they found him. Straight line, hit the burn. When I went to visit that house,
[1:47:09.100 --> 1:47:15.820]  just to check it out, and this was very soon after the debt, I get there into my chagrin.
[1:47:16.540 --> 1:47:25.020]  There's a carpet laying truck there. I go up and I said, buddy, you're replacing the carpet.
[1:47:25.020 --> 1:47:29.180]  You see the other room. We've got to replace the carpet in. I said, well, can I see the carpet?
[1:47:29.180 --> 1:47:33.980]  He said, well, that's weird. The carpet's already gone. They'd already taken it up,
[1:47:33.980 --> 1:47:39.340]  but then he led me into the room and he said, well, I tell you what's crazy. Look at this.
[1:47:39.340 --> 1:47:42.460]  And in the middle of room, it looks like somebody bled a hog out,
[1:47:43.820 --> 1:47:47.580]  but they had taken the carpet. So I'm going, well, I guess that.
[1:47:47.580 --> 1:47:52.620]  So he shot himself in the whore pad and they had to cover that up because they didn't want an
[1:47:52.620 --> 1:47:58.460]  investigation of the whorehouse. That's right. They didn't want it by the DC police. Remember,
[1:47:58.460 --> 1:48:03.260]  that's the key thing. The park police, as you know, that's right. They're always finding the
[1:48:03.260 --> 1:48:08.540]  debt interns drug onto the park land. Yeah. That way they can cover it up. The park police have
[1:48:08.540 --> 1:48:15.740]  been the fixers for politicians for years and years and years. So I go in, there's the stain
[1:48:15.740 --> 1:48:20.540]  in the floor, obviously. And I say to the guy, well, God, I wish there'd have been so in that
[1:48:20.540 --> 1:48:24.140]  carpet. I need as well. I don't tell you what kind of carpet it was. Now folks, this is his
[1:48:24.140 --> 1:48:29.740]  exact words. Come over here and you looked at the tack and strip. He said, look, pulled up a piece
[1:48:29.740 --> 1:48:38.300]  of, he said, it's long, multicolored, charred carpet. Exactly what matches the autopsy. Exactly.
[1:48:39.100 --> 1:48:46.940]  But remember, don't worry about that. It's all in the documents that we had that autopsy report
[1:48:46.940 --> 1:48:53.180]  Alex is a killer. It's a killer because now you're dealing with science, metaphysics.
[1:48:53.180 --> 1:48:57.980]  They can call me a liar. They can call you a liar. They can do whatever. But that's the autopsy report.
[1:48:59.100 --> 1:49:05.420]  So when that comes out, we'll break it out of here. And the point to all of this is the American
[1:49:05.420 --> 1:49:10.860]  people need to hear the truth about the real Hillary Clinton. Well, Larry, I'm going to say
[1:49:10.860 --> 1:49:16.380]  this right now. It is amazing having you via video Skype. Your phone quality is not good.
[1:49:16.380 --> 1:49:23.100]  I would like to invite you up later this week to really go over even more. Just bam, bam, bam.
[1:49:23.100 --> 1:49:26.620]  When we come back, though, I really want to specifically get in
[1:49:27.260 --> 1:49:30.220]  to what else you think they're going to pull, where you think they're going.
[1:49:30.860 --> 1:49:39.020]  What does your gut tell you? Is this Obama waging war against the Clintons or is Trump for real?
[1:49:39.020 --> 1:49:42.780]  Because if he was a show for Hillary saying she's a crooked, she'll step down.
[1:49:42.780 --> 1:49:48.060]  That's something that even if he flip-flops later is damaging her. I don't see him making
[1:49:48.060 --> 1:49:51.500]  statements like that if he's still under her control. What do you think?
[1:49:52.380 --> 1:49:56.860]  Well, I think there's a chance Trump's real. I hope he's real. But now Alex,
[1:49:56.860 --> 1:50:01.340]  do you want me to burst everybody's bubble about Trump? Go ahead. Remember, guys,
[1:50:01.340 --> 1:50:05.500]  the reason the Clintons had me around, which is because I was putting good old country strategy
[1:50:05.500 --> 1:50:11.100]  just when it came to politics. Now I want all of you to take Donald Trump's numbers,
[1:50:11.100 --> 1:50:18.220]  take Carl Fiorini's numbers, take Ben Carson's numbers, and take Ron Paul,
[1:50:18.220 --> 1:50:26.060]  Ron Paul's numbers, add those up, and come primary day in the RNC primary. That's what
[1:50:26.060 --> 1:50:31.260]  Trump's going to end up with. Now, let's take another candidate for Zemp opportunity.
[1:50:31.900 --> 1:50:37.020]  Stay there. Explain to us the numbers from political strategy. Again, you're one of the
[1:50:37.020 --> 1:50:43.420]  admitted brain experts on Clinton's successful gubernatorial rhymes and one of his fixers
[1:50:43.420 --> 1:50:47.980]  until it got into narcotics trafficking and you wouldn't be part of it. Larry Nichols is our guest.
[1:50:49.020 --> 1:50:53.340]  I can't believe it's deja vu. We're back to battling the Clintons. They just never go away
[1:50:53.340 --> 1:50:55.820]  like her piece. I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[1:50:59.020 --> 1:51:02.140]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates,
[1:51:02.140 --> 1:51:06.060]  while our U.S. politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.

[1:55:25.100 --> 1:55:29.340]  Clintons today. I mean, he was their big confidant, but he would not be part of the death of teenagers
[1:55:29.340 --> 1:55:32.780]  that saw the drug dealing, the flying the drugs in. He just wouldn't be part of it.

[1:55:55.580 --> 1:56:01.020]  supposed to take and put it in water. I do it at lunch, like I'm doing right now.
[1:56:01.020 --> 1:56:04.540]  And then every couple of days, I don't do it every day because I just go ahead and take
[1:56:04.540 --> 1:56:09.260]  a full squirt. I'm supposed to take less than that a day. I just do it every few days. I take
[1:56:09.820 --> 1:56:17.660]  the X-Tube and I had a spoon here. Here it is. The nation iodine from infowarslife.com

[1:56:35.500 --> 1:56:43.580]  but I've lost 65 pounds in the last few years, gotten a lot healthier. And it's been a game changer
[1:56:43.580 --> 1:56:48.220]  in your purchase of these amazing nutraceuticals. There's 14 different ones we've developed now
[1:56:48.220 --> 1:56:53.820]  at infowarslife.com, funds this operation. Here's what James and Toronto Canada had to say,
[1:56:53.820 --> 1:56:56.860]  improve quality of my life, well work the money. I would recommend it.
[1:56:57.900 --> 1:57:01.660]  Supermell Vitality. Here's another one. This is from Sweet Lou in Connecticut.
[1:57:02.380 --> 1:57:05.900]  Just finishing my first bottle, I've already ordered and received my second bottle. I am
[1:57:05.900 --> 1:57:09.180]  using this with several other products, drinking purified water. I quickly felt the difference
[1:57:09.180 --> 1:57:13.180]  in my energy levels and alertness, especially at the end of the day, when I would normally
[1:57:13.180 --> 1:57:17.500]  be more tired than I am now. Yes, someone's got to go work at like midnight on some like coast
[1:57:17.500 --> 1:57:22.300]  to coast. I'll just drink a bunch of it. Very impressed with products sold by infowars.
[1:57:23.660 --> 1:57:27.420]  I would normally be more tired than I am now. Well, thank you. And that's just the latest.
[1:57:27.420 --> 1:57:34.780]  There's over 500 reviews on third party review site right there at infowarslife.com. Larry,
[1:57:34.780 --> 1:57:39.260]  we got a final five minutes coming up. And as usual, you and I are both from the south. We
[1:57:39.260 --> 1:57:43.900]  babble a lot. We talk over each other. Well, you know, we, we, we tell stories into tale.
[1:57:43.900 --> 1:57:49.180]  What's the other big dirt that you've got on the Clintons? Obviously, we need to get this out
[1:57:49.180 --> 1:57:52.700]  quickly. So we should get you back on the next few days via video Skype. I want to thank you
[1:57:52.700 --> 1:57:56.540]  for hooking it up, but briefly tell us what's coming up in the next final segment. Go ahead
[1:57:56.540 --> 1:58:01.900]  and get it out there. What's the other intel you got on the Clintons? Well, the most important thing,
[1:58:01.900 --> 1:58:10.860]  of course, is the autopsy. But the other stuff that I've got coming out has to do with Alaskan
[1:58:10.860 --> 1:58:16.940]  fisheries. Alaskan fisheries. Now, if you don't think that's important, folks, it got Ron Brown
[1:58:16.940 --> 1:58:27.100]  killed. Ron Brown, the Secretary of Commerce, Alex, the, the stuff is there. When Vince Foster died,
[1:58:28.380 --> 1:58:34.860]  it was all there the whole time. Kenneth Starr claimed to me that he wasn't going to get into,
[1:58:34.860 --> 1:58:38.540]  if he wasn't murdered. Hold on back at 70 seconds. This is a bombshell. I'm going to write to you
[1:58:38.540 --> 1:58:44.140]  at 70 seconds. Larry Nichols. Then we've got the economic breakdown coming up with Joe Salente.

[1:59:21.500 --> 1:59:26.060]  months. You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of

[2:00:08.300 --> 2:00:16.780]  Cover-offs. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:00:16.780 --> 2:00:24.540]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. All right, Larry Nichols, we've got five minutes
[2:00:24.540 --> 2:00:28.780]  left. I want to invite you back up on Thursday or Friday if you can do it, sir, to really get into
[2:00:28.780 --> 2:00:34.700]  more of this and take phone calls. Clinton inside are joining us. Finish up. You've got five minutes.
[2:00:34.700 --> 2:00:38.140]  Also get into Trump. You never had a chance to talk about that. How he
[2:00:38.140 --> 2:00:44.620]  conversed our bubble. Go ahead. Well, Ron Brown is going to be significant. By the way,
[2:00:44.620 --> 2:00:49.980]  back to the autopsy of Clinton, I mean, Vince Foster. Oh, she got to realize the doctor that
[2:00:49.980 --> 2:00:56.940]  did the autopsy, they brought him out of retirement, Alex. The last, that guy did the autopsy on
[2:00:56.940 --> 2:01:03.820]  John F. Kennedy. He was retired and they brought him out of retirement to conduct the autopsy on
[2:01:03.820 --> 2:01:12.540]  Vince Foster. Number one. Now back to Ron Brown. When Ron Brown died, he had come out and say,
[2:01:12.540 --> 2:01:19.180]  I had broken a story about Alaskan fisheries where Ron Brown had said Alaskan fisheries had come up
[2:01:19.180 --> 2:01:23.580]  with this boat that could catch fish and process fish at the same time on the boat.
[2:01:24.300 --> 2:01:28.780]  Ron Brown passed an order and said it was illegal to do that. So they had to stop
[2:01:28.780 --> 2:01:34.940]  catching fish and processing them on the boat. But when he did that, Alaskan fisheries stock
[2:01:35.500 --> 2:01:43.180]  plummeted to like, God, 25 cents a share for $8.90 a share. Well, Clinton, long time friend and
[2:01:43.180 --> 2:01:51.820]  supporter, Don Tyson goes in and buys out Alaskan fisheries stock. All of it. 30 days after he buys
[2:01:51.820 --> 2:01:59.020]  it, Ron Brown changes the ruling and makes it okay now again to do, to, you know, to process the
[2:01:59.020 --> 2:02:05.580]  fish on the same ship that catches them. Now, when that happened, I mean, this is a huge profit
[2:02:05.580 --> 2:02:13.020]  for Tyson. Well, I got ahold of it and I started pressing on it. Now the media actually got ahold
[2:02:13.020 --> 2:02:17.980]  of that and started querying Ron Brown and it looked like we were getting some congressional
[2:02:17.980 --> 2:02:22.700]  investigations. And Brown said, if I go down, everybody goes down. You got it, Alex. When he
[2:02:22.700 --> 2:02:29.340]  said that, I think you and I talked about it. I said, he won't be around long. We did. Well,
[2:02:29.340 --> 2:02:34.860]  then he goes on a junket into Germany and his plane flies into the side of the mountain. Well,
[2:02:34.860 --> 2:02:39.740]  folks, here's where that story gets weird. I had two captains or majors that came to me from the
[2:02:39.740 --> 2:02:44.540]  Air Force that actually did the autopsy. You were the one that released to the Washington Times,
[2:02:44.540 --> 2:02:50.220]  right? I remember where they, they did the, the unofficial one when he, the intake and he had
[2:02:50.220 --> 2:02:55.660]  a bullet hole in his head, right? A 45 bullet. The exact bullet hole in the top of his head,
[2:02:55.660 --> 2:03:01.180]  exact the same, exactly the size of the 45 caliber bullet, which is what the military carried in
[2:03:01.180 --> 2:03:07.420]  that day. And then there was a stewardess, which was really a sergeant, Sergeant Kelly. When they
[2:03:07.420 --> 2:03:12.620]  got to the crash site, folks, she was sitting on the stump crying. She walked to the helicopter.
[2:03:12.620 --> 2:03:17.580]  And as you remember, Alex, when she landed at the base with the helicopters, she's dead on a
[2:03:17.580 --> 2:03:24.460]  rifle. They show me the X-ray and that lady's brainstem had been completely set. Special forces,
[2:03:24.460 --> 2:03:28.700]  broker neck. We're out of time. I want to have you back in a couple of days. You can do it to
[2:03:28.700 --> 2:03:33.180]  take calls and flesh more of the South bombshell. Thank you for your courage. Briefly, what's the
[2:03:33.180 --> 2:03:37.980]  problem with Trump? He, he doesn't go as well against Hillary in a general election. He doesn't,
[2:03:37.980 --> 2:03:42.460]  he doesn't go well at all because what's going to happen in the primary, that's where they'll beat him.
[2:03:42.460 --> 2:03:46.940]  But there's stuff we need to talk about about that. What he says when he says he's not going to
[2:03:46.940 --> 2:03:52.220]  swear, he won't switch it to an independent is because of the dirty tricks that he knows the
[2:03:52.220 --> 2:03:57.900]  RNC will pull on him and get him kicked out of the race in five or six states. And therefore,
[2:03:57.900 --> 2:04:03.420]  he can't win. That's what he's saying. If they pull those stunts, he will switch parties.
[2:04:03.420 --> 2:04:09.340]  And Alex, by the way, we don't have enough time but to tell all the dirty tricks, but there is a
[2:04:09.340 --> 2:04:14.780]  company because of the last show I did with you. They're putting out the genies out of the bottle,
[2:04:14.780 --> 2:04:20.300]  which is simply a book that tells you all of the tricks and it's listenupaudiobooks.com.
[2:04:20.300 --> 2:04:25.500]  They're doing it. I'm not, you need to get that book and it'll tell you Alex play by play what
[2:04:25.500 --> 2:04:30.540]  Hillary's doing right now and what she'll do in the future. Well, it's great having you be a video
[2:04:30.540 --> 2:04:34.540]  Skype and I'm going to send the crew up. I'm going to not procrastinate. We're going to have Rob do
[2:04:34.540 --> 2:04:39.020]  call you if it's okay at about 15 minutes, give you a break. And I want to send a crew up to just
[2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:44.780]  let you dump it all on us, show the documents, everything up there to Arkansas. Okay. You bet,
[2:04:44.780 --> 2:04:49.180]  Alex. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, Larry. And we're praying for you. Everybody say a prayer.
[2:04:49.180 --> 2:04:53.900]  Larry Nichols, a real patriot exposing evil. We appreciate you, buddy. We'll be back with our
[2:04:53.900 --> 2:05:00.700]  next guest on the world financial meltdown. You've heard about boot camps for juvenile delinquents
[2:05:00.700 --> 2:05:05.100]  here in the United States. Well, now a similar system is looking at being installed in the UK.
[2:05:05.100 --> 2:05:09.340]  That's right. Jobless young people will be made to attend boot camps and return for benefits as
[2:05:09.340 --> 2:05:13.900]  part of a new conservative drive to bring a no excuse culture to youth employment under the plan
[2:05:13.900 --> 2:05:18.380]  anyone under 21 who is out of work and on benefits will have to take part in a three week intensive
[2:05:18.380 --> 2:05:23.260]  course to help them find employment or training. The changes will come into force in April next year
[2:05:23.260 --> 2:05:27.500]  and form part of the government's wider drive to ensure that all young people are in a job,
[2:05:27.500 --> 2:05:32.700]  apprenticeship, traineeship or unpaid work experience. Currently, UK's youth unemployment rate is
[2:05:32.700 --> 2:05:38.380]  hovering around 15%. In the United States, it's around 12%. But all the youth need not worry.
[2:05:38.380 --> 2:05:43.500]  In 10 years, 130 jobs will be taken over by robots. And since you've been conditioned to go to camps
[2:05:43.500 --> 2:05:48.860]  anytime the government is there to help, Hillary Clinton has an idea for adults. I have decided
[2:05:48.860 --> 2:05:55.020]  we really need camps for adults. That's right. FEMA camps coming soon to a dystopic future near you.

[2:08:02.140 --> 2:08:08.300]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future. Not a future that will
[2:08:08.300 --> 2:08:16.140]  be but one that might be. This is not a new world. It is simply an extension of what began in the old
[2:08:16.140 --> 2:08:22.140]  one. It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot
[2:08:22.140 --> 2:08:28.780]  on the pages of history since the beginning of time. It has refinements, technological advances,
[2:08:28.780 --> 2:08:34.940]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom. But like every one of the
[2:08:34.940 --> 2:08:47.180]  super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule. Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[2:08:47.180 --> 2:08:54.380]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on Earth. He's a citizen of the state but will
[2:08:54.380 --> 2:09:01.980]  soon have to be eliminated because he is built out of flesh and because he has a mind. Mr. Romney
[2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:06.060]  Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[2:09:11.900 --> 2:09:19.900]  We are live. Clashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[2:09:19.900 --> 2:09:29.820]  network. That's right we're live on this Monday the 17th day already of August 2015. Joining us
[2:09:29.820 --> 2:09:35.340]  is Gerald Salente, one of our most popular gas good friend of mine. And I want to cover the
[2:09:35.340 --> 2:09:44.700]  waterfront from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton to Japan nuclear utility. Reactivating a nuclear
[2:09:44.700 --> 2:09:49.980]  reactor and one month after they turned it on, the first new one to be turned on, they turned
[2:09:49.980 --> 2:09:55.980]  them all off since the Fukushima disaster four years ago and a volcano started erupting right
[2:09:55.980 --> 2:10:01.820]  next to it. That's in Reuters. I shouldn't laugh it's not funny. The winds blow this way.
[2:10:02.860 --> 2:10:09.980]  Also new report massive immigration surge from Mexico. Latin America is continuing to degenerate
[2:10:09.980 --> 2:10:13.820]  and fall apart. There's a worldwide depression. Africa is collapsing. The Middle East is in
[2:10:13.820 --> 2:10:19.740]  turmoil and they're telling us everything's wonderful here. Greece has got big problems.
[2:10:20.300 --> 2:10:24.700]  We're going to cover all of that. I haven't gotten to this yet too. I want to get Gerald
[2:10:24.700 --> 2:10:30.300]  Salente's take on the attempt to stir up racial problems in the country, clearly by the White
[2:10:30.300 --> 2:10:37.260]  House. We've got two white sorority video slam for being racially homogeneous, but only because
[2:10:37.260 --> 2:10:41.420]  it's white and homogeneous. It's okay for any other group to be in a group. I mean it's just
[2:10:41.420 --> 2:10:46.620]  amazing how they push this. Black lives matter activists wipe their butts with Confederate flag,
[2:10:46.620 --> 2:10:48.940]  group wave communist flags during their confrontation.
[2:10:48.940 --> 2:10:56.380]  This is like all these fake phony victories that political correctness gives people where you obsess
[2:10:56.380 --> 2:11:00.540]  over stuff that doesn't matter and then all of our basic freedoms are being taken. Our dollars
[2:11:00.540 --> 2:11:07.420]  being devalued or being spied on. We've got the IRS persecuting people. Nixon got in trouble good,
[2:11:07.420 --> 2:11:13.260]  but what Hillary and others have done is much worse. It's just incredible. So that's all coming
[2:11:13.260 --> 2:11:21.580]  up. But the main reason I wanted to get Gerald Salente on with us is because he has been accurately
[2:11:21.580 --> 2:11:29.100]  predicting for a decade that by 2014, 2015, we would see a world financial meltdown. It's looking
[2:11:29.100 --> 2:11:34.300]  at derivatives, the trends, because here when the dollars devalued or currencies are devalued,
[2:11:34.940 --> 2:11:38.940]  it just means you can't go on as many vacations even if you're working class or whatever. You
[2:11:38.940 --> 2:11:44.060]  have trouble paying your bills. When you start spending 50% or more of your discretionary income
[2:11:44.060 --> 2:11:48.460]  on food as they do in most of the world, riots start. All hell breaks loose.
[2:11:51.180 --> 2:11:57.100]  And now we see this headline on the one in Telegraph. Doomsday clock for global market crash
[2:11:57.100 --> 2:12:03.100]  strikes one minute to midnight as central banks lose control. That's not info wars.com. That's
[2:12:03.100 --> 2:12:10.460]  not trendsresearch.com. We've said it before, of course, that's the London Telegraph. China
[2:12:10.460 --> 2:12:15.260]  currency devaluation signals in game, which is exactly what our guests have said the last week,
[2:12:16.380 --> 2:12:20.940]  is leaving the equity markets free to collapse under the weight of impossible
[2:12:20.940 --> 2:12:30.460]  expectations. Yes, false earnings, overvalued stocks, huge debts, derivatives. When the banking
[2:12:30.460 --> 2:12:35.180]  crisis crippled global market seven years ago, central bankers stepped in as leaders of last
[2:12:35.180 --> 2:12:42.780]  resort of lenders, profligate private sector loans were moved onto the public sector balance sheet,
[2:12:44.060 --> 2:12:50.380]  and vast money printing gave the global economy room to heal. No room for it to be even worse.
[2:12:52.300 --> 2:12:55.180]  Rats chewed our legs off, so they just gave us morphine.
[2:12:55.180 --> 2:13:01.500]  Time is now rapidly running out from China to Brazil, the central banks have lost control,
[2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:05.740]  at the same time the global economy is grinding to a halt. It is only a matter of time before
[2:13:05.740 --> 2:13:10.620]  stock market collapses under the weight of their lofty expectations and record valuations.
[2:13:11.180 --> 2:13:18.220]  And the 2.2 quadrillion we've been signed onto, that isn't our debt. The FTSE 100 has now erased
[2:13:18.220 --> 2:13:23.180]  its gains for the year, but there are signs things could get a whole lot worse. People say, well,
[2:13:23.180 --> 2:13:28.940]  a correction of 10-20% is not a big deal globally because it's overvalued. But even the overvaluation
[2:13:28.940 --> 2:13:35.340]  can't prop up the derivatives and the debt. Do you understand? So if they cut interest rates
[2:13:35.340 --> 2:13:44.540]  anymore, it's impossible because they're already zero. It causes inflation. If they don't, it causes
[2:13:44.540 --> 2:13:49.820]  the economy to shut down even faster. And then this excellent article goes over it all. The
[2:13:49.820 --> 2:13:54.140]  difference is Gerald Solente, Dr. Paul Kirk Roberts, who works with him at the Trends Journal,
[2:13:54.140 --> 2:13:59.420]  former Wall Street Journal editor, the editor, former head of policy at the Treasury for Reagan,
[2:13:59.420 --> 2:14:02.140]  has been saying the same thing. Mr. Dent's been saying the same thing.
[2:14:03.100 --> 2:14:07.100]  Chef's been saying the same thing. We have the guests on. There's not many of them, but we have
[2:14:07.100 --> 2:14:14.940]  them who are more accurate than mainstream media. Mainstream media is trying to deceive the public
[2:14:14.940 --> 2:14:19.500]  while they themselves run to the hills and dig in like all hell's about to break loose.
[2:14:19.500 --> 2:14:25.980]  Here's another article. Ron Paul, Fed may not hike because everything is vulnerable.
[2:14:27.660 --> 2:14:32.140]  Did you know that the U.S. no longer has any strategic grain reserves at all?
[2:14:32.140 --> 2:14:36.220]  That's a Michael Schneider report, economic collapse blog, infowars.com.
[2:14:36.220 --> 2:14:41.100]  Greek government on its last legs while Angela Merkel faces growing rebellion in Berlin.
[2:14:42.060 --> 2:14:45.980]  Yeah, because no amount of bailouts will fix the debt. It's just more to the very bankers.
[2:14:45.980 --> 2:14:50.860]  We loaned them the money to bail them out and then we're in debt to them. So that's some of the
[2:14:50.860 --> 2:14:55.020]  news on the economic front. I've got a whole nother stack we'll go over with Gerald Salente,
[2:14:55.020 --> 2:15:01.660]  but Gerald, everything seems to be spiraling out of control. Escalations and military operations,
[2:15:01.660 --> 2:15:07.340]  trying to topple Assad for ISIS, escalating military conflict with Russia on its border.
[2:15:08.220 --> 2:15:11.580]  This is the stuff we saw before World War I and World War II. As you said,
[2:15:11.580 --> 2:15:17.100]  when the economy goes down, they take you to war historically to divert attention
[2:15:17.100 --> 2:15:21.900]  so the crooks don't go to jail. Hillary is on the verge of maybe getting indicted.
[2:15:21.900 --> 2:15:27.020]  Woodward signals this by saying it's Nixonian and it's not going to look good when it comes out.
[2:15:27.580 --> 2:15:30.940]  Trump now turns against her. What do you think is going on, Gerald Salente?
[2:15:31.740 --> 2:15:35.900]  Well, on the economic front, I mean, you really summed it up because it all ties together.
[2:15:35.900 --> 2:15:42.780]  I think you began with these immigration wave coming over and when you go south of the border,
[2:15:42.780 --> 2:15:50.300]  even below Mexico away, it's currency crisis after currency crisis, commodity crash after
[2:15:50.300 --> 2:15:56.780]  commodity crash. Current events form future trends. What happened yesterday over in Brazil?
[2:15:56.780 --> 2:16:01.180]  Well, they had a wonderful time. About a half a million people turned out to protest against
[2:16:01.180 --> 2:16:06.940]  the government. How come? Well, they're in a recession. Inflation is skyrocketing and the
[2:16:06.940 --> 2:16:13.660]  currency is plummeting. Take a look over there in Chile, not too far away. Hey, you want some really
[2:16:13.660 --> 2:16:20.540]  hot real estate? I can get you in a real good deal on some commercial stuff, just built. I could
[2:16:20.540 --> 2:16:26.220]  rent it to you for almost nothing because copper prices have collapsed. They're at their six-year
[2:16:26.220 --> 2:16:32.380]  lows. Go back to Brazil. They're not exporting natural resources the way they were before
[2:16:32.380 --> 2:16:39.820]  because you also talked about China. China gobbles up over 50 percent of most of the world's
[2:16:39.820 --> 2:16:47.660]  exports of raw materials each year. And we saw their numbers come out for July. What was exports
[2:16:47.660 --> 2:16:55.980]  down? Almost 9 percent. Keep going. Mexico? Hey, how about that peso? Yeah, it's back to what? Oh,
[2:16:55.980 --> 2:17:02.860]  when they revalued it in 1993, those levels? Yeah, those levels. You think you're going to see
[2:17:02.860 --> 2:17:09.020]  immigration? Hey, how about Colombia? Oh, it's wonderful with those slumping gas prices and oil
[2:17:09.020 --> 2:17:15.500]  prices. They're not exporting either. You think they want to leave there? So you go after country,
[2:17:15.500 --> 2:17:22.860]  after country, from South America, go to, from Africa, South Africa. Hey, how about those gold
[2:17:22.860 --> 2:17:34.620]  prices, Canadian prices? How about Australia, Rio Tinto? How about Anglo-American? How about them
[2:17:34.620 --> 2:17:44.620]  Anglo-American firing 53,000 people because they're not producing? Where are they going?
[2:17:44.620 --> 2:17:50.620]  You mentioned the wars in Libya brought to us by our Nobel Peace Prize winner,
[2:17:50.620 --> 2:17:56.700]  Hillary Clinton, Samantha Powers, and Susan Rice. Total disarray. When Gaddafi was in there,
[2:17:56.700 --> 2:18:03.660]  they weren't flooding out of the shores of Tripoli into, into Italy, into... Hundreds die a week
[2:18:03.660 --> 2:18:12.220]  going across the med just to Italy. One island in Greece, Lesbos, has 156,000 refugees on one
[2:18:12.220 --> 2:18:19.020]  tiny island. This is the collapse of the world. But our media tells us everything's fine, and Gerald
[2:18:19.020 --> 2:18:25.500]  Salenta and Alex Jones are fear porn dealers. Yeah, well, again, we just stick with the facts.
[2:18:25.500 --> 2:18:30.700]  They suck up to the people that pay them their money. So what you're looking at is a global
[2:18:30.700 --> 2:18:35.900]  collapse. Oh, I forgot about Yemen. Yeah, the United States and our allies, the Piedras in
[2:18:35.900 --> 2:18:42.700]  chief. How many things slaughter so far beheaded in Saudi Arabia this year? I think it's up to 127.
[2:18:42.700 --> 2:18:48.780]  ISIS has a long way to go to catch up to them. They're slaughtering people in the poorest country
[2:18:48.780 --> 2:18:54.620]  in the Middle East, Yemen. Where are they flooding to? They're flooding into Greece. They're flooding
[2:18:54.620 --> 2:19:00.620]  into Italy, Afghanistan. You mentioned Greece, flooding into Greece. You look at what's going
[2:19:00.620 --> 2:19:05.900]  on in Egypt. You look what's going on in Iraq. You look what's going on in Somalia, Sudan.
[2:19:07.820 --> 2:19:18.380]  It's chaos. The global economy has collapsed. Commodity prices are down to 2002 levels.
[2:19:18.380 --> 2:19:24.700]  We were in a recession in 2002. And Gerald, I looked it up. Since they created the National
[2:19:24.700 --> 2:19:31.020]  Grain Reserves in World War II, it's never been empty. The government has exhausted the grain.
[2:19:31.020 --> 2:19:37.820]  I mean, they've never done that. And you look, look at, look at, as I said, commodity prices, corn
[2:19:38.620 --> 2:19:45.420]  from corn to coal to copper to iron ore. Everything has collapsed. China's not buying this stuff.
[2:19:45.420 --> 2:19:50.220]  Look at the data. Look what just came out today. Stay there. Stay there. Gerald Salente,

[2:21:55.100 --> 2:22:03.500]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinovets. I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold. By now,
[2:22:03.500 --> 2:22:07.020]  you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[2:22:07.020 --> 2:22:11.020]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials
[2:22:11.020 --> 2:22:15.820]  started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[2:22:15.820 --> 2:22:19.340]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[2:22:19.340 --> 2:22:24.860]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S. passports, hotel room keys,
[2:22:24.860 --> 2:22:30.140]  and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID. It was then I formed ID Stronghold to
[2:22:30.140 --> 2:22:34.780]  share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world. There are a lot of misconceptions
[2:22:34.780 --> 2:22:38.940]  out there today about RFID. I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.

[2:24:01.020 --> 2:24:06.780]  What you don't know, can and will hurt you in many cases. That's why we're here trying to
[2:24:06.780 --> 2:24:12.700]  follow exactly what's happening. It's kind of like Japan building nuclear reactors right down
[2:24:12.700 --> 2:24:21.100]  the mountain from a quasi-active volcano. It's not a good idea. Well, letting private banks
[2:24:21.100 --> 2:24:27.740]  and brokerage firms create 2.2 quadrillion in the last few decades of fake money and then letting
[2:24:27.740 --> 2:24:35.580]  themselves leverage that to buy up the world and then have us sign on to it. That doesn't sound
[2:24:35.580 --> 2:24:41.900]  like a very good idea. And then siphon off production, raise taxes to the point that
[2:24:41.900 --> 2:24:47.740]  civilization starts to crumble with 7.5 billion people. It's a time bomb. And if you look at the
[2:24:47.740 --> 2:24:54.460]  footage of the illegals in Europe coming in on boats and running across into the fences by the
[2:24:54.460 --> 2:24:59.500]  thousands at a time, now we have footage like that in the United States. And then the incentive to
[2:24:59.500 --> 2:25:05.820]  bring people here and get free stuff, it is a ticking time bomb. A total ticking time bomb.
[2:25:07.660 --> 2:25:12.220]  And this is about the political takeover of this country. Gerald Solente, this is a short
[2:25:12.220 --> 2:25:16.220]  segment, long segment coming up. Again, thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:25:16.220 --> 2:25:23.820]  Gerald Solente from trendsresearch.com. Continue. You were getting into the world melting down around
[2:25:23.820 --> 2:25:28.940]  us. People now know it's like Trump says make America great again. Well, I thought we're already
[2:25:28.940 --> 2:25:33.740]  great according to mainstream media. Are people waking up to the fact that we are not in this
[2:25:33.740 --> 2:25:38.780]  wonderful economy like they've been saying? Oh, absolutely. You know, the polls all show it.
[2:25:38.780 --> 2:25:43.260]  And as I was saying, the current events are forming future trends. You know,
[2:25:43.260 --> 2:25:48.380]  I just look at what the numbers that came out of Japan, their second quarter GDP,
[2:25:48.380 --> 2:25:57.260]  it was down 1.6%. This is after pumping in trillions, trillions of yen under the guise
[2:25:57.260 --> 2:26:04.860]  of abenomics. You remember they did it by the way, just as the Fed announced that they were
[2:26:04.860 --> 2:26:12.860]  going to end quantitative easing three days later back in October a year ago, the Japanese
[2:26:12.860 --> 2:26:18.540]  pulled the stunt that they were going to dump in more money into abenomics and it boosted up
[2:26:18.540 --> 2:26:25.100]  the economy fake. It only boosts up the equity markets as all this cheap dough is done. The
[2:26:25.100 --> 2:26:32.380]  facts are right before us. You have the yen sinking in value and they still can't export
[2:26:32.380 --> 2:26:41.580]  enough stuff to have a positive GDP. This is simply basic. The number is right there.
[2:26:41.580 --> 2:26:46.300]  What does it do with the yuan being driven down and is it doomsday clock
[2:26:46.300 --> 2:26:50.060]  for global market crash one minute to midnight like the telegraph says?
[2:26:50.060 --> 2:26:55.980]  Well, again, you know what I say. Everybody knows a little bit about history. Try this one on.
[2:26:56.540 --> 2:27:03.420]  Currency wars, trade wars, world wars. That was World War II. You're looking at the facts over
[2:27:03.420 --> 2:27:12.060]  here in New York. They just had the manufacturing index come out. Alex, it's down 15%. What a
[2:27:12.060 --> 2:27:19.020]  recovery. I guess it's the cold winter, huh? Well, look, I mean, it's a hot summer. Look,
[2:27:19.020 --> 2:27:25.820]  it numbers are in front of us. We're looking at numbers. That index, by the way, it's the lowest
[2:27:25.820 --> 2:27:34.700]  since April of 2009. Go back two months ago. The IMF came out and forecast that growth in 2015
[2:27:34.700 --> 2:27:40.940]  is back to 2009 levels. And then you're looking, as I said, the commodity prices. Hey, you're
[2:27:40.940 --> 2:27:46.460]  over there in Texas. You remember all those boom towns everywhere from North Dakota. Why are you
[2:27:46.460 --> 2:27:52.460]  every boom boom with the shell? What's going on now? Last week is sort of what was it?
[2:27:52.460 --> 2:27:59.980]  Sampson's over there bankruptcy in Oklahoma. Oh, the fall, the fall, the fracking industry
[2:27:59.980 --> 2:28:03.820]  and the domestic drilling is going to just devastate at least six, seven states. It's going
[2:28:03.820 --> 2:28:08.780]  to be much bigger than the subprime crisis in my view. Well, look again, look at the facts. You
[2:28:08.780 --> 2:28:14.060]  saw all of these, these hedge funds and all of these private equity groups and speculators and
[2:28:14.060 --> 2:28:22.220]  banks dumping tons of money into their boosting up their industry and the junk bonds in the United
[2:28:22.220 --> 2:28:33.260]  States 15% to 20% are in the energy industry. It doesn't take a genius to figure this one out.
[2:28:33.260 --> 2:28:40.300]  The thing is collapsing in front of everybody's eyes. The facts are all there. They cannot be
[2:28:40.300 --> 2:28:46.300]  covered up. Can they be manipulated? Of course they can. You know, we talk about gold prices,
[2:28:46.300 --> 2:28:52.620]  by the way, they're moving back up. What brought gold prices down? Hey, how about over there in China
[2:28:52.620 --> 2:29:01.820]  when the Shanghai gold index shorted gold in two minutes in August in July, rather,
[2:29:01.820 --> 2:29:09.340]  when the Japanese markets were closed, they usually trade about 16 tons a day in two minutes
[2:29:09.340 --> 2:29:21.260]  on the Shanghai gold exchange. They shorted 33 tons. So the collapse is here, but the crooks,
[2:29:21.260 --> 2:29:27.580]  criminals, cowards, liars, freaks and fools called the Federal Reserve and the governments around
[2:29:27.580 --> 2:29:34.380]  the world will do anything to manipulate it as they did with the market today in the United States.
[2:29:34.380 --> 2:29:39.260]  Stay there. Let's talk about that when we come back. Stay there. We come back. Long segment will get into
[2:29:39.980 --> 2:29:44.860]  how they're manipulating and skimming off the top as they sink the ship and as they run
[2:29:44.860 --> 2:29:49.260]  to their armored bunkers. I mean, what are they thinking? Stay with us. We're on the march,
[2:29:49.260 --> 2:29:54.620]  the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:58.860 --> 2:30:03.980]  Scientists develop GMO painkillers using rat DNA and yeast, reports Anthony Gucciardi from
[2:30:03.980 --> 2:30:08.940]  Infowars.com. Stanford scientists have developed a new way of creating painkiller components like
[2:30:08.940 --> 2:30:14.460]  hydrocodone by injecting 23 different engineered genes from plants, bacteria and rats into yeast.
[2:30:14.460 --> 2:30:18.140]  The result is the beginning of the journey towards GMO painkillers and another entrance
[2:30:18.140 --> 2:30:21.740]  into the world of genetically modified pharmaceuticals, a world that far expands
[2:30:21.740 --> 2:30:26.300]  beyond the tinkering of Monsanto's GMOs. This new advancement places into perspective the
[2:30:26.300 --> 2:30:30.620]  depths to which the booming industry of DNA alteration will take us. Currently, this new
[2:30:30.620 --> 2:30:34.940]  yeast based system is not strong enough to replace traditional painkillers made from poppies,
[2:30:34.940 --> 2:30:39.900]  but this technology is just in its infancy. America is currently in a painkiller epidemic.

[2:36:17.420 --> 2:36:24.300]  or infowarsstore.com Alabama Eddie and Auburn Alabama says started with one a day for a few days
[2:36:24.300 --> 2:36:29.260]  saw slight changes in focus then one with breakfast another mid morning that's when I
[2:36:29.260 --> 2:36:33.740]  could tell the difference it's becoming more profound as time progresses I'm on the waiting
[2:36:33.740 --> 2:36:41.820]  list for more inwards kudos well more is back in Alabama Eddie so thank you so much for believing
[2:36:41.820 --> 2:36:47.260]  us that it's high quality getting it using it it's got two ingredients that are prescription in Europe
[2:36:49.100 --> 2:36:53.580]  so research it for yourself find out that comparable formulas are twice as much or more
[2:36:53.580 --> 2:37:01.820]  brain force infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and that funds our operation also the nightly news
[2:37:01.820 --> 2:37:06.540]  is subscriber really making some very big announcements the next two weeks about that
[2:37:06.540 --> 2:37:10.780]  it's gonna be free to air on satellite everywhere but still that cost me 40 grand a year because
[2:37:10.780 --> 2:37:17.740]  federally you got to do 10 grand a month 40 grand a month uh 10 grand a month of that is just a
[2:37:17.740 --> 2:37:22.220]  close capturing that's the cheapest we could get whereas it's federal law it's a person doing it
[2:37:22.220 --> 2:37:27.500]  four hours a day 10 grand a month for that then like all together it's about $40,000 a month to
[2:37:27.500 --> 2:37:33.100]  put us up on main satellite so TV, UHF, VHF cable wherever could pick it up we've already
[2:37:33.100 --> 2:37:37.260]  got them lining up and picking it up without even announcing it I guess I just did announce it it's
[2:37:37.260 --> 2:37:42.300]  already up but I'm gonna kind of formalize it make the big announcement I can't ever I'm not the
[2:37:42.300 --> 2:37:46.860]  guy that likes us coming up we're gonna cover this and then I'll say no we'll do it now but
[2:37:46.860 --> 2:37:52.780]  I'll lay the full thing out soon it's just that's very inexpensive way to get on satellites covering
[2:37:52.780 --> 2:37:58.300]  all of North America from Mexico up to Alaska from out in the Atlantic Ocean over to the Pacific
[2:37:59.020 --> 2:38:03.420]  and if we able to launch it and successful I'll put us on satellites in Europe everywhere else
[2:38:03.420 --> 2:38:08.940]  but you add it all together when you buy the products it helps fund the operation
[2:38:09.500 --> 2:38:13.580]  and that's what our goal is to get more reporters more writers and then kind of round it out with
[2:38:13.580 --> 2:38:17.420]  two or three more reporters a couple more camera people and editors a couple more writers and we're
[2:38:17.420 --> 2:38:21.340]  going to be done because I just it's too hard to try to go out and make the money to fund all this
[2:38:21.340 --> 2:38:25.980]  but you've you've helped us so I'd rather spend all my time on news and information and you've
[2:38:25.980 --> 2:38:29.980]  been helping us and supporting us so I've been able to do some of that so thank you we've also
[2:38:29.980 --> 2:38:34.460]  done it by bringing you great products so it's a win-win for everybody and then it's important
[2:38:34.460 --> 2:38:40.060]  to support folks and get us free updates you can sign up via email but trendsresearch.com
[2:38:40.060 --> 2:38:45.900]  or sign up for the quarterly magazine invaluable information to read yourself but give to friends
[2:38:45.900 --> 2:38:52.380]  and family at trendsresearch.com all right Gerald Salente you got cut off by the break
[2:38:53.260 --> 2:38:58.380]  you were getting into where you see all this going and then I want to shift gears into
[2:38:58.380 --> 2:39:03.660]  some of the culture control and ask you what you think the elite's in game is but they're literally
[2:39:04.380 --> 2:39:09.900]  counting their money up on the deck of the Titanic as it's listing they're not even smart enough to
[2:39:09.900 --> 2:39:15.420]  get in the lifeboats first I guess some elites are how close are we to the big event or is it just
[2:39:15.420 --> 2:39:21.660]  still this slow slide and like Baghdad Bob is US tanks for two miles away and fighter jets are
[2:39:21.660 --> 2:39:26.620]  flying behind him bombing he's going the Americans have been kicked out of Iraq they're not even in
[2:39:26.620 --> 2:39:31.420]  the country I mean it seems like that's what they're doing denying what's happening in the economy
[2:39:32.060 --> 2:39:37.420]  yeah well they are I just want to comment though also that how important it is that
[2:39:37.420 --> 2:39:42.700]  the listeners support the products and buy the products that you're selling because of the highest
[2:39:42.700 --> 2:39:50.620]  quality and to put their money where their mind is because if they don't support people like yourself
[2:39:50.620 --> 2:39:58.220]  the trends journal and others that are putting out this information that you can't find anywhere
[2:39:58.220 --> 2:40:05.020]  else they're really stopping the progress of freedom because for us to make freedom ring
[2:40:05.020 --> 2:40:10.700]  you know we're in a capitalist society and there's nobody behind the curtain giving us this dough
[2:40:10.700 --> 2:40:16.300]  to make it happen and I know how hard you work you know how hard we work to make it happen so I
[2:40:16.300 --> 2:40:22.700]  really urge everyone to do the best you can to spend the most you can in supporting enterprises
[2:40:22.700 --> 2:40:28.540]  like prisonplanet.com and the products that they have those high quality products and of course
[2:40:28.540 --> 2:40:35.820]  the trends journal so in looking at where the real money is putting their money it's flooding
[2:40:35.820 --> 2:40:42.140]  out of China they're dumping out of there as quick as they can because they know the collapse is
[2:40:42.140 --> 2:40:48.220]  underway you look at also in the United States you're looking at exodus is coming in a lot of the
[2:40:48.220 --> 2:40:54.380]  equity markets they're getting their dough out a lot of people expect it to happen but they're only
[2:40:54.380 --> 2:41:01.020]  keeping the suckers in it's like what they did in China you know some 80 percent of that Shanghai
[2:41:01.020 --> 2:41:05.980]  index was supported by the government promoting it to the little people hold on a minute I'm
[2:41:05.980 --> 2:41:10.220]  gonna give you the floor but I want to go back here because I live in Austin one of the only boom
[2:41:10.220 --> 2:41:15.340]  towns in the United States and it's so politically correct I don't say this meanly I'm making an
[2:41:15.340 --> 2:41:22.140]  observation when I do go to nice areas of Austin or go to a nice outdoor mall or something just so
[2:41:22.140 --> 2:41:30.300]  happened to be near luxury places there's just rich Chinese in $200,000 Mercedes and Ferraris
[2:41:30.300 --> 2:41:38.380]  and their kids are driving Ferraris or brand new $100,000 Audi's and it's like all the rich
[2:41:38.380 --> 2:41:41.900]  Mexicans seem to have moved Austin which you know fine with me you know that makes it more
[2:41:41.900 --> 2:41:46.540]  prosperous the rich Chinese are like parachuting in you were talking about that a few years ago
[2:41:46.540 --> 2:41:51.740]  that the rich Chinese were leaving that shows they know what's going under so now they're trying to
[2:41:51.740 --> 2:41:57.100]  just pump it up with the general public and that's what's so scary so the Chinese and Mexicans
[2:41:58.220 --> 2:42:03.740]  are running to the US but the banker robber barons are running to New Zealand and to armored
[2:42:03.740 --> 2:42:11.340]  redoubts in the Ozarks doesn't that really signify the the big crisis is almost here sorry yes I
[2:42:11.340 --> 2:42:16.380]  believe the crisis is going to happen before the end of the year and you know we're putting you
[2:42:16.380 --> 2:42:21.900]  know it's it's a forecast you know could we be wrong of course we can and and you know the trends
[2:42:21.900 --> 2:42:28.460]  journals 54 pages full color there's not one advertisement in there so what I have to say
[2:42:29.420 --> 2:42:34.780]  is has nothing to do with people paying me to say it because we're getting advertising money
[2:42:34.780 --> 2:42:42.940]  and and so I am bullish on gold I said it when gold was down you know another $50 lower than it is
[2:42:42.940 --> 2:42:50.140]  now that I believe that the bottom of gold was around 1110 50 and I still believe that's the
[2:42:50.140 --> 2:42:57.500]  bottom the upside potential to me is well over 2000 and you're seeing it going back up because
[2:42:57.500 --> 2:43:03.500]  all of a sudden they lump gold in as another commodity that was going down no gold is a
[2:43:03.500 --> 2:43:10.700]  safe haven commodity and no gold is not pegged to the dollar in the sense that with a dollar gold
[2:43:10.700 --> 2:43:16.380]  goes gold goes the only reason the dollar has any strength at all is because of all these other
[2:43:16.380 --> 2:43:22.780]  economies I was talking about that are collapsing look what's going on in in Russia the GDP is
[2:43:22.780 --> 2:43:30.460]  now at 4.5% look what's going on in China as I mentioned you have a GDP that most experts believe
[2:43:30.460 --> 2:43:38.700]  is around 4% it already where it is at 7% with their official number that's down to two decades low
[2:43:38.700 --> 2:43:46.380]  so gold is the safe haven commodity you don't peg it at least I don't to whether it is going to be
[2:43:46.380 --> 2:43:51.660]  inflation whether it's no it has nothing to do with that to me it has to do with here I'll give
[2:43:51.660 --> 2:43:59.260]  you an example suppose you lived in Brazil suppose you see your Brazilian real now going back what
[2:43:59.900 --> 2:44:06.860]  to 16 year lows and gold is pegged on a dollar and all of a sudden you see your currency crashing
[2:44:06.860 --> 2:44:13.580]  against the dollar what if you own gold wouldn't you be better off hey you don't even have to go
[2:44:13.580 --> 2:44:21.980]  that far take a trip up to Canada yeah look there in a recession take a look at the Canadian dollar
[2:44:21.980 --> 2:44:31.180]  oh wow the loonies losing it it's down to 2004 levels hey how come ah cost a lot of money doesn't
[2:44:31.180 --> 2:44:37.660]  it to produce that oil out of those tar sands and oil prices are way down don't oh you talked about
[2:44:37.660 --> 2:44:46.380]  New Zealand watch that one go down Alex as milk prices and dairy prices are plummeting again
[2:44:46.380 --> 2:44:52.300]  it's commodities across the board New Zealand's not doing so well anymore so you're going to look
[2:44:52.300 --> 2:45:00.940]  at the Aussie dollars six year lows I mentioned Anglo-American Rio Tinto whether it's Royal Dutch Shell
[2:45:00.940 --> 2:45:07.340]  layoffs by the tens no you're right you predicted that that the 2008 thing wouldn't work and within
[2:45:07.340 --> 2:45:11.580]  10 years 7 to 10 years it would fall apart and the media just keeps saying no everything's fine
[2:45:11.580 --> 2:45:16.860]  everything's wonderful 2 plus 2 equals 5 or 20 or whatever whatever Obama says it is today
[2:45:16.860 --> 2:45:24.620]  let's look at now other areas of this looking at China looking at Japan looking at Europe
[2:45:24.620 --> 2:45:29.900]  looking at Greece looking at all the things that are happening the elite go into Gaddafi who was
[2:45:29.900 --> 2:45:34.380]  investing most of the country's money in building up an infrastructure in Africa that the global
[2:45:34.380 --> 2:45:39.340]  is sitting in control they blew it up destabilized the whole continent same thing with Syria
[2:45:40.380 --> 2:45:46.060]  overthrowing our allies in Egypt shutting down our power plants here only giving central
[2:45:46.060 --> 2:45:54.380]  inside guys the free money from the banker bailouts the free interest money clearly the
[2:45:54.380 --> 2:46:00.220]  globalists are trying to destroy the economy of the world while exempting themselves from their own
[2:46:00.220 --> 2:46:06.060]  rules and regulations to consolidate it but then they destroy the planet that they're stealing
[2:46:06.060 --> 2:46:11.580]  at the same time but they can't seem to help their predatory instinct where does all this end
[2:46:11.580 --> 2:46:17.340]  up going well they'll try to create sectarian divide and conquer vulcanization they'll say a
[2:46:17.340 --> 2:46:22.940]  sorority video showing a bunch of white girls is racist but you know it's okay to have a black bar
[2:46:22.940 --> 2:46:27.820]  Hispanic bar or whatever they will have people wiping their butts with confederate flags is
[2:46:27.820 --> 2:46:32.780]  distraction you know just goes on and all these little petty issues while all of us lose our
[2:46:32.780 --> 2:46:39.900]  freedoms how do we cut through that fog and let people realize that this is a crisis and
[2:46:39.900 --> 2:46:45.020]  then here's my other question I kind of alluded to it is there a method to the white shoe boys
[2:46:45.020 --> 2:46:49.580]  as you call the madness because they clearly want to destabilize and make everybody else
[2:46:50.460 --> 2:46:56.460]  bankrupt they don't control don't they get they're screwing over the markets that allow them to
[2:46:56.460 --> 2:47:04.460]  operate no they're ruthless and they're driven they don't have that they don't have the morality
[2:47:04.460 --> 2:47:11.980]  to think past money and power so it's not even you know again you just look by their deeds you
[2:47:11.980 --> 2:47:17.180]  shall know them so they don't understand that destroying the earth is destroying their lives
[2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:23.980]  as well this is who they are and on this racial issue a good friend of mine a justice past weekend
[2:47:23.980 --> 2:47:29.740]  had an issue where she was trying to back out and a bunch of black people surrounded a car and
[2:47:29.740 --> 2:47:34.860]  saying you know colored people count and this is a woman you know she's the first thing for a racist
[2:47:34.860 --> 2:47:40.140]  you ever want to say and and so what they're doing is they're using that divide and conquer
[2:47:40.140 --> 2:47:47.740]  if african-americans have anybody to point their finger at with hate and disgust it should be at
[2:47:47.740 --> 2:47:54.700]  the president of the united states this isn't the racist nation they're making it one let's make this
[2:47:54.700 --> 2:48:00.540]  really clear if this was a racist nation are they racist in the nation of course there are
[2:48:00.540 --> 2:48:04.940]  hey there are people that don't like italians don't like hispanics don't like jews you're always
[2:48:04.940 --> 2:48:11.740]  going to find ignorant people but a racist nation would never have elected a black president plus
[2:48:11.740 --> 2:48:16.780]  everybody wouldn't be trying to get here we're not perfect but we've been a really cool country
[2:48:16.780 --> 2:48:20.940]  and they're just diverting getting us all fighting with each other because the globalists are robbing
[2:48:20.940 --> 2:48:28.220]  us it's so stupid and and alex just to keep making the point if it was a racist nation we would not
[2:48:28.220 --> 2:48:36.540]  have had the top guy ahead of law as a black man eric holder and now loretta lynch another black
[2:48:36.540 --> 2:48:43.820]  woman we would not have the head of the united nations it was susan rice you would not have a
[2:48:43.820 --> 2:48:51.980]  secretary of state as condoleezza rice or or colon powell or others so let's not call it a racist
[2:48:51.980 --> 2:49:00.140]  nation if you want to point the finger point it at obama point it at holder point it at that low
[2:49:00.140 --> 2:49:10.140]  life man who never convicted one head of the white shoe boys to white fear eric you're afraid of
[2:49:10.140 --> 2:49:20.460]  them eric as you're putting all the other people of color in jail hey eric hey miss lynch yeah lynch
[2:49:20.460 --> 2:49:31.500]  how about you how about you who convicted five banks oh excuse me six of felonies convicted
[2:49:31.500 --> 2:49:41.980]  of felonies for reading the library and the forex market and did not did not prosecute one so if
[2:49:42.700 --> 2:49:49.980]  african americans have a problem with the government why don't you call it what it is
[2:49:49.980 --> 2:49:58.620]  your own people have sold you out for the white shoe boys well absolutely a white president couldn't
[2:49:58.620 --> 2:50:03.500]  get away with doubling the black unemployment it's not even an issue the black people are getting
[2:50:03.500 --> 2:50:09.340]  totally screwed over by every metric and so of course obama's screaming race all day as a diversion
[2:50:09.340 --> 2:50:17.580]  and it's working as i said they're lynching us that's who lynches lynching she won't lynch the
[2:50:17.580 --> 2:50:25.180]  boys on wall street they only go after we the little people hey the fb guy got a couple in
[2:50:25.180 --> 2:50:34.780]  mrs sippy that was gonna go to syria and join ices what are you kidding me oh why big deal that's
[2:50:34.780 --> 2:50:44.460]  who they're going after they make a big deal out of little news as they give their guys a free ride
[2:50:44.460 --> 2:50:52.060]  and they're causing hate and division among us and it's terrible and and it's going to continue
[2:50:52.060 --> 2:50:59.340]  unless we the people bring morality and justice absolutely stay there stay there gerald so i say
[2:50:59.340 --> 2:51:03.180]  the market lunch look you know i keep hearing from the government that you know they're worried

[2:54:21.900 --> 2:54:28.860]  generation the freedom disappears now we're hitting the wall here's an article at info wars dot
[2:54:28.860 --> 2:54:36.620]  com it's amazing there's video little terror airport security confiscates kids fart blaster toy
[2:54:36.620 --> 2:54:44.380]  from the movie minions and it looks like a purple ray gun speaker machine doesn't even look like a
[2:54:44.380 --> 2:54:53.500]  gun anymore on can tell that this is a toy but this is the idea of the nanny state this is how
[2:54:53.500 --> 2:54:58.300]  horrible it is so i'm going to commit a thought crime right now and actually show the hypothetical
[2:54:58.300 --> 2:55:16.780]  fart gun inaction from the movie despicable me here it is and here of course is the new weapon you ordered
[2:55:18.540 --> 2:55:24.620]  oh yes because i was wondering under what circumstances would we use this but anyway
[2:55:24.620 --> 2:55:31.180]  um i can't believe hillary clinton stars in that show as the mad scientist you know hillary's in
[2:55:31.180 --> 2:55:37.180]  that uh getting back to jerry salento trends research uh jerald you were uh getting into
[2:55:37.180 --> 2:55:43.980]  something very important as we uh hit that break uh in summation you say you see us hitting a major
[2:55:43.980 --> 2:55:48.380]  bump in the rub by the end of the year a lot of folks are saying that now i hope you're wrong i hope
[2:55:48.380 --> 2:55:55.420]  i'm wrong but the indicators are there ron paul saying it uh how long can this go on and and how
[2:55:55.420 --> 2:56:01.900]  what are the what's the main scenario you see well when we you talk we're talking about the
[2:56:01.900 --> 2:56:07.020]  racial divide that's going to really pit people against each other so it's going to become very
[2:56:07.020 --> 2:56:14.860]  ugly uh unless we have somebody that's leading us that brings morality back into the show and uh
[2:56:14.860 --> 2:56:19.660]  you know ron paul was the last person that was out there that was really doing anything
[2:56:19.660 --> 2:56:25.580]  across the board of of making something like that happen and i just don't see that happening now
[2:56:25.580 --> 2:56:30.940]  so the racial divide will worsen you're going to have a lot of social unrest and it's global as i
[2:56:30.940 --> 2:56:35.340]  said there's there were half a million people yesterday in brazil it's happening all over the
[2:56:35.340 --> 2:56:41.100]  world so they're going to divide and conquer is going to be the scenario oh and you mentioned about
[2:56:41.100 --> 2:56:46.300]  a homeland security i believe the head of that is a black person too so how about that
[2:56:46.300 --> 2:56:51.500]  for a racist country you know we've got a guy like that resting little kids before well it turns out
[2:56:51.500 --> 2:56:58.940]  nancy polosi has her staff out running this even in dc who lives in the lap of luxury i mean imagine
[2:56:58.940 --> 2:57:02.860]  you're just pulling out your car and people surround you chanting at you because you're white
[2:57:02.860 --> 2:57:07.420]  don't they understand that's the opposite of what martin Luther king said they have no idea what you
[2:57:07.420 --> 2:57:13.900]  stand for but it's because you're white you must have done something because msnbc said so again
[2:57:13.900 --> 2:57:18.460]  that's the way they're selling it so there's a divide in conquer it's a very going to be a very
[2:57:18.460 --> 2:57:25.020]  it's going to be a very difficult time coming and again as you know alex we're launching occupy peace
[2:57:25.580 --> 2:57:32.300]  over here in colonial kingston and here is the the photo but it's more than just peace overseas
[2:57:32.300 --> 2:57:38.460]  it's to stop this mindset it's to bring peace back to the united states that's why it's occupied
[2:57:38.460 --> 2:57:44.300]  peace dot us because if we don't have it we're going to lose it and we're doing everything we can
[2:57:44.300 --> 2:57:50.060]  to make that happen because they're just dividing us more and more it's clear something big is coming
[2:57:50.060 --> 2:57:58.860]  because the weaponization of cnn msnbc the most obvious clan level race baiting uh it is just so
[2:57:58.860 --> 2:58:05.100]  dirty so nasty so transparent but it's working like a charm well just like what happened when they
[2:58:05.100 --> 2:58:09.980]  killed a kid what north carolina south carolina that didn't do anything and he was white they
[2:58:09.980 --> 2:58:15.900]  don't they don't show that they you know so that they so they're doing it they're making it a racial
[2:58:15.900 --> 2:58:20.620]  issue when it's much bigger than that yeah there are some out of control militarized psycho cops
[2:58:21.340 --> 2:58:26.140]  and it's a terrible situation but killing each other and surrounding an old white lady's car
[2:58:26.140 --> 2:58:31.180]  isn't going to fix it's going to maybe turn her into a racist if she wasn't one jerald great job

[2:59:52.460 --> 3:00:06.220]  alex jones show from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[3:00:06.220 --> 3:00:13.820]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network i covered most of the news today there's
[3:00:13.820 --> 3:00:19.180]  a lot of important stuff i didn't get to i'll make sure to special report just for the nightly news
[3:00:19.180 --> 3:00:25.020]  tonight seven o'clock because of it you know gerald has been on the show for i don't know about
[3:00:27.180 --> 3:00:32.060]  10 11 now about 12 years been on the show since about 2003 or four
[3:00:32.060 --> 3:00:38.220]  and he's never really gotten too worried about the whole balkanization racial divide but you
[3:00:38.220 --> 3:00:44.620]  hurt him up in kingston new york i mean it's happening all over the country uh because you're
[3:00:44.620 --> 3:00:49.900]  white you get chanted at you get yelled at you get people saying things to you i i experienced a
[3:00:49.900 --> 3:00:59.180]  little bit of this in the in the in the 80s in dallas but now i've experienced it in east austin
[3:00:59.180 --> 3:01:09.900]  and i've been i've been living here 24 years and it's just bizarre um it's really bad and
[3:01:09.900 --> 3:01:14.060]  but it's because mainstream media that has credibility with democrats especially
[3:01:15.420 --> 3:01:19.420]  is saying that white people are sneaking around out to get you and they hate you another reason
[3:01:19.420 --> 3:01:26.140]  you don't have jobs and again some old random white person or some kid is out to get you
[3:01:26.140 --> 3:01:32.940]  a while a bunch of offshore banks loot us and and overthrow countries and kill people and
[3:01:32.940 --> 3:01:40.220]  and it's classic divide and conquer and i look at how they make it this big victory to dig up
[3:01:40.220 --> 3:01:43.900]  confederate generals i mean i don't care if you do that but the point is you think you're having
[3:01:43.900 --> 3:01:49.580]  this big victory black lives matter activists wipe their butts with confederate flag group
[3:01:49.580 --> 3:01:55.500]  waves communist flags during confrontation the photos and news articles are linked to the article
[3:01:55.500 --> 3:02:00.940]  about poll Joseph Watson and i'm going to show some of this viewer discretion advice we're going to
[3:02:00.940 --> 3:02:06.940]  scroll down people basically have american flags crammed in their rear ends flipping people off
[3:02:06.940 --> 3:02:13.100]  and it only degrades them i guess this is a new movement to crown american flags up your rear
[3:02:13.100 --> 3:02:17.580]  end and i'm sorry to talk about this but it's a medical mental illness issue in my opinion
[3:02:18.380 --> 3:02:23.420]  and always a bunch of white liberal commies waving the red flags with black people marching with them
[3:02:23.420 --> 3:02:33.260]  i mean it's just despicable it's so stupid and then yeah you got some white sorority it's not
[3:02:33.260 --> 3:02:38.380]  officially white but it's all a bunch of rich white girls i bet if you're poor you're not invited
[3:02:38.380 --> 3:02:43.260]  i'm not knocking the sorority that's just how they are there's some elite sorority of richie rich
[3:02:43.260 --> 3:02:49.500]  daughters two white sorority videos slamper being racially homogeneous so you can have an
[3:02:49.500 --> 3:02:53.820]  Hispanic group black groups where you have their fraternities but if a group looks like it's almost
[3:02:53.820 --> 3:02:58.700]  completely white why it's evil and and that's a double standard that's wrong but it's all part of
[3:02:58.700 --> 3:03:05.500]  this balkanization the university of alabama sorority recruitment video was slammed as being
[3:03:05.500 --> 3:03:10.060]  racially homogeneous and objectifying women because it features a number of attractive
[3:03:10.060 --> 3:03:15.580]  thin white girls the video shows a group of mostly white women partying and dancing to promote the
[3:03:15.580 --> 3:03:25.100]  alpha pie who are based in the particular campus however the clip set up a firestorm of criticism
[3:03:25.100 --> 3:03:33.500]  from al.com writer al bailey asserting that the video was worse for women than donald trump
[3:03:34.780 --> 3:03:42.780]  it's also racially and aesthetically homogeneous and forced so hyper feminine so reductive so
[3:03:42.780 --> 3:03:50.380]  objectifying and so stepford wife i don't know if it was a group of hot Hispanic women or black
[3:03:50.380 --> 3:03:54.140]  women dancing around the house it doesn't look too objectifying to me much it looks like a bunch
[3:03:54.140 --> 3:03:58.300]  of girls having fun by the way all the really successful women are like that and then they
[3:03:58.300 --> 3:04:03.500]  also wear suits and are successful in other ways but they get the power of feminism of true
[3:04:03.500 --> 3:04:12.940]  femininity feminism itself is a fake projection on the women to destroy their power and it's disgusting
[3:04:12.940 --> 3:04:18.220]  but that's the type of stuff that's going on i mean the media says it's great to stick american
[3:04:18.220 --> 3:04:24.700]  flags in the crack of your pants and act like an idiot because it's you know straight out of mac
[3:04:24.700 --> 3:04:31.660]  daddyville when that's not even black culture blacks were some of the most sharp-dressed people
[3:04:31.660 --> 3:04:38.380]  50 60 years ago in this country now mtv takes a particular punk type dress from prisons meaning
[3:04:38.380 --> 3:04:44.620]  that you're the sex slave they put it out and and and all the white kids i see uh a lot of them seem
[3:04:44.620 --> 3:04:48.700]  to think it's fun to have their pants hanging around their ankles or you know hanging down over
[3:04:48.700 --> 3:04:54.860]  their butts all that means is you're a punk i mean it's all a sick joke you see these young people
[3:04:54.860 --> 3:05:02.620]  i'm like man why are you dressed like a punk
