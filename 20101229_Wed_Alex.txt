[00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:10.027]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.027 --> 00:00:11.608]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:13.149]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:17.351]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:21.413]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.730]  Well, this year is almost over.
[00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.772]  It is Wednesday, the 29th day of December, 2010.
[00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:53.994]  We have an absolutely jammed-packed broadcast for you today.
[00:00:53.994 --> 00:01:00.097]  We have Webster Griffin, Tarpley, and Attorney Phil Berg joining each other simultaneously, coming up in T-minus 32 minutes from now.
[00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:25.214]  And they're going to be discussing the huge new developments on the birther birth certificate issue the new Governor-elect who will be in office in just a few weeks early next year of Hawaii says that he's going to release the original blueprint with the signatures the actual birth certificate and we've seen this flip-flop from Chris Matthews and others who said
[00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:27.514]  They've released the birth certificate.
[00:01:27.514 --> 00:01:29.035]  This is the birth certificate.
[00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:35.636]  Now they admit, oh, you actually couldn't get in the CIA with a receipt of birth certificate.
[00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.677]  You have to show your blueprint.
[00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:41.878]  You have to show the original with the signatures.
[00:01:41.878 --> 00:01:43.718]  So this is a big deal.
[00:01:43.718 --> 00:01:46.419]  And have they manufactured one?
[00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:48.019]  Or is it a bluff?
[00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:49.420]  Are they going to really release it?
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.720]  Why didn't they do this two years ago?
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.661]  And people for over two years have been demanding it.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.980]  I think so.
[00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:16.173]  That is coming up.
[00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:18.034]  Webster Tarpley and Phil Berg.
[00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:28.904]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, editor of Natural News, with key information dealing with the bills to take over the family farm, the family ranch.
[00:02:28.904 --> 00:02:40.715]  It's more than that, and he excises out the subsections of a new article detailing how it's really part of a global enforcement of Codex Alimentarius, with the United States trying to empower that UN program by stealth.
[00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:49.438]  Kind of like Obama was in the news this morning saying, yeah, we're going to go ahead with carbon taxes, federal home inspections, federal zoning, total control.
[00:02:49.438 --> 00:02:51.279]  I don't care if Congress didn't pass it.
[00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.000]  I'm ordering the bureaucracy to move forward.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.161]  He also went ahead and announced, hey, guess what?
[00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:57.901]  The death panels are still there.
[00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:59.002]  We're going to cut your health care.
[00:02:59.942 --> 00:03:01.763]  Because we're liberal and loving.
[00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:04.745]  And Bill Gates is out teaching folks how great it is as well.
[00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:06.046]  So Mike Adams coming on.
[00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:16.993]  Porter Stansbury will be popping in for 30 minutes to continue with his prediction and why he's predicting that the dollar in next year, sometime during 2011, will officially not be the World Reserve currency anymore.
[00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:19.955]  That's already starting to happen with China and Russia no longer dealing in dollars.
[00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:36.206]  And then of course, former Dallas Cowboy, all-star guy, Mark Stepnoski will be joining us with one of the architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, who of course really helped wake up Geraldo Rivera and others on Fox News.
[00:03:36.206 --> 00:03:46.093]  They'll be joining us to talk about 9-11 Truth in the last hour and some big announcements on that front with the Building What campaign that we launched here a few months ago.
[00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:51.576]  I guess six months ago or so that's now had such a big effect in New York City.
[00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:56.079]  So jam-packed broadcast for you today.
[00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.060]  I'm gonna attempt...
[00:03:59.121 --> 00:04:00.542]  Of course, I didn't do this yesterday.
[00:04:00.542 --> 00:04:01.323]  I covered some of it.
[00:04:01.323 --> 00:04:06.107]  I'm going to attempt to just graze through at least the surface.
[00:04:06.107 --> 00:04:07.509]  I don't have 100 plus articles.
[00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.972]  I've only got about 50 or so, and we'll probably cover two or three.
[00:04:10.972 --> 00:04:15.896]  But they're all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:20.440]  And just so much information on those sites.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.646]  Great job that the overall internet crew is engaged in at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:26.646 --> 00:04:31.411]  And great job to the listeners out there spreading the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:35.815]  They just continue to break records in people visiting them.
[00:04:36.936 --> 00:04:42.300]  The two twin sites, Liberty and Justice, up there fighting hard.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:55.009]  The reason we're having so much success reaching more people with this vital message of liberty, exposing the tyranny of the New World Order, is because of you, the listeners, of the syndicated radio broadcast simulcast via video at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:55.809]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:56.690]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.751]  Key transmission straight ahead.
[00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:06.362]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:06.362 --> 00:05:15.223]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:15.223 --> 00:05:19.844]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:19.844 --> 00:05:30.666]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:31.306 --> 00:05:40.809]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:46.251]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:53.734]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:53.734 --> 00:05:56.495]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:01.617]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:01.617 --> 00:06:08.561]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:11.103]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:16.486]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:16.486 --> 00:06:19.528]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:21.589]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:28.094]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:28.094 --> 00:06:31.476]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:37.241]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:38.902]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:38.902 --> 00:06:40.183]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:40.183 --> 00:06:42.865]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:42.865 --> 00:06:47.088]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:47.088 --> 00:06:49.710]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.691]  End of America 3.com.
[00:06:51.691 --> 00:06:54.293]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:06:54.293 --> 00:06:58.156]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:58.156 --> 00:06:59.236]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:07:02.284 --> 00:07:04.026]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:04.026 --> 00:07:09.753]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:07:09.753 --> 00:07:14.499]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:18.263]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[00:07:18.263 --> 00:07:20.286]  They have two holiday price packs.

[00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.933]  The first is a six-month bulk supply in tin cans.
[00:07:28.933 --> 00:07:35.940]  And the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy to fix meals including delicious bakery items shipped in heavy tote bags.

[00:07:47.744 --> 00:07:50.145]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:03.828]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.828 --> 00:08:07.174]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:24.702]  Jam-packed transmission today.
[00:08:24.702 --> 00:08:31.927]  Webster Tarpley and Phil Berg joining us in about 25 minutes on the huge developments on Obama's birth certificate.
[00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:33.928]  We'll give you the latest on that coming up.
[00:08:33.928 --> 00:08:44.055]  Mike Adams on the fact that they're having, quote, a flu pandemic over in Europe, over in England, despite the fact that it's being triggered by the flu vaccine itself, which is admitted.
[00:08:45.237 --> 00:09:05.734]  Porter Stansbury pops in with more on dollar devaluation and we're also going to have former Dallas Cowboy lineman star Dallas Cowboy Mark Stepnoski on with an engineer with the latest 9-11 developments in a program that they're launching that'll be announced here on the broadcast today coming up in about two hours from now.
[00:09:06.835 --> 00:09:09.036]  Okay, let me just do this.
[00:09:09.036 --> 00:09:22.160]  I always try to do it and then I don't, but let me just read to you some of the headlines I've got here that are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now on this live 29th day of December 2010.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.120]  It's about to be 2011.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.800]  Then it'll be 2012.
[00:09:26.887 --> 00:09:31.770]  In 2013, and our lives go by like the twinkling of an eye.
[00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:53.544]  This happened over the holidays when I was out of town, and I've mentioned this before, because it's actually come out before, that when we get all these internal FBI, Homeland Security reports, I mean the latest a few months ago was in Pennsylvania, they didn't just have Homeland Security, they had Israelis spying on the legislature.
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.161]  Wiretapping, you name it.
[00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:57.041]  They had the U.S.
[00:09:57.041 --> 00:09:57.742]  Army involved.
[00:09:57.742 --> 00:10:01.103]  I mean, again, this is a criminal government.
[00:10:01.103 --> 00:10:02.524]  They're spying on the Congress.
[00:10:02.524 --> 00:10:04.485]  They're spying on the legislature.
[00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:05.586]  It's not the government.
[00:10:05.586 --> 00:10:07.567]  The government is the legislature.
[00:10:07.567 --> 00:10:09.327]  The government is the Congress.
[00:10:09.327 --> 00:10:15.911]  The illegitimate, rogue bureaucracy that works for the offshore banks is the enemy.
[00:10:17.062 --> 00:10:28.966]  Why do you think these different agencies going back more than 60 years, every time you turn around, get caught running secret torture centers, secret biological, chemical, radiological testing centers?
[00:10:28.966 --> 00:10:32.887]  It's not about testing the chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals.
[00:10:32.887 --> 00:10:37.109]  They can test those on guinea pigs and get the exact same ratio.
[00:10:37.109 --> 00:10:42.970]  Okay, if it kills a rat, or a guinea pig, or a rabbit, or a dog, or a pig, it's gonna kill a human.
[00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.231]  It works the exact same way.
[00:10:46.223 --> 00:10:47.443]  Plus it's immoral.
[00:10:47.443 --> 00:10:48.924]  That's a side issue.
[00:10:48.924 --> 00:10:56.647]  They have created armies of cadres of people that will put a baby in a radiation chamber and murder them.
[00:10:56.647 --> 00:11:00.208]  That will fly over our troops during a drill and nerve gas them.
[00:11:00.208 --> 00:11:04.349]  And then they practice how to cover it up.
[00:11:04.349 --> 00:11:05.370]  I said I'd get into the news.
[00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.371]  It's just this morning I was jogging and it just really hit me again.
[00:11:09.795 --> 00:11:15.158]  Just how evil these people are and how much danger we're all in if we don't resist them.
[00:11:15.158 --> 00:11:18.780]  Because they're trying to totally take over every facet of society.
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:29.366]  I was sent more internal FBI manuals and internal fear-mongering propaganda that they give local businesses.
[00:11:29.366 --> 00:11:37.031]  They're going to the gun shops, they're going to the tattoo parlors, the haircutting places, the Walmarts, the farmer supply facilities.
[00:11:38.387 --> 00:11:39.228]  I've got it right here.
[00:11:39.228 --> 00:11:44.032]  Communities Against Terrorism, Potential Indicators of Terrorist Activity.
[00:11:44.032 --> 00:11:46.434]  And it says, what should I consider suspicious?
[00:11:46.434 --> 00:11:51.519]  First thing, new customer who is not from local area, and it goes on from there.
[00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:58.826]  And the first thing the FBI people say when they come in and talk to the different businesses is, do you want to stop a new Oklahoma City?
[00:11:59.943 --> 00:12:02.406]  Well, you're going to be our little agent now.
[00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:03.968]  Our little informant.
[00:12:03.968 --> 00:12:06.592]  And then the next meeting it's, do you know about gun owners?
[00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:09.416]  Do you know about people criticizing the government in your area?
[00:12:09.416 --> 00:12:12.179]  I mean, I have this confirmed literally hundreds of times.
[00:12:12.179 --> 00:12:14.042]  And we have their internal documents.
[00:12:14.042 --> 00:12:16.065]  The MIAC, the Homeland Security, the list goes on and on.
[00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:26.055]  So again, they tell you, oh, we're here to stop Al Qaeda, then it's, oh, we're here to stop Tim McVeigh, and then it's, oh, we're here to stop the Ron Paul people.
[00:12:26.055 --> 00:12:28.437]  We're here to stop the folks that want us out of the UN.
[00:12:28.437 --> 00:12:31.379]  We're here to stop the people that want to cut the size of government.
[00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:38.144]  What was in the Pennsylvania information that got leaked out, and the head of Homeland Security in that state had to step down?
[00:12:38.144 --> 00:12:41.446]  But it was all under federal auspices, it was all under federal directives.
[00:12:44.598 --> 00:13:01.683]  In the manuals that we published, in the internal reports that we published and local newspapers in Pennsylvania published, it said right there, they're protesting, and these members of the legislature are protesting, higher taxes.
[00:13:01.683 --> 00:13:03.884]  And that threatens the infrastructure of the government.
[00:13:05.356 --> 00:13:12.163]  I mean, they actually sit there in FBI and Homeland Security meetings and say, these states want to cut government.
[00:13:12.163 --> 00:13:13.144]  That'll cut our pay.
[00:13:13.144 --> 00:13:14.646]  That'll cut our positions.
[00:13:14.646 --> 00:13:15.967]  That's a threat to government.
[00:13:15.967 --> 00:13:21.033]  See, it's government now against the people.
[00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:25.237]  And so, wiretap these people in the legislature.
[00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:25.738]  Follow them.
[00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:30.637]  This member of the legislature is running a pro-gun group.
[00:13:30.637 --> 00:13:32.818]  He's a potential terrorist!
[00:13:32.818 --> 00:13:38.103]  And then they couldn't get the state police to spy on the members of the legislature, so they brought Israelis in!
[00:13:38.103 --> 00:13:39.484]  And it's all on record!
[00:13:39.484 --> 00:13:40.625]  It's all illegal!
[00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:43.367]  And nobody goes to jail!
[00:13:43.367 --> 00:13:45.008]  What came out four or five years ago?
[00:13:45.008 --> 00:13:48.972]  That MI6 and MI5 spy on every member of the Parliament in England.
[00:13:48.972 --> 00:13:51.654]  The Parliament is the supposed government!
[00:13:51.654 --> 00:13:54.897]  What is the rogue police agencies doing?
[00:13:54.897 --> 00:13:56.218]  That's what happened in Nazi Germany!
[00:13:58.493 --> 00:13:59.893]  That's who Hitler went out and recruited.
[00:13:59.893 --> 00:14:06.636]  He went out and recruited the cops, the law enforcement, the military people, and then a bunch of street thugs and criminals to back him up.
[00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:08.016]  What was in the news two days ago?
[00:14:08.016 --> 00:14:15.159]  All over the country, the Army and National Guard is recruiting felons out of prisons as their backup.
[00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:20.200]  They introduced it to the public that, oh, it's for disasters, but when you read the fine print, and civil unrest.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.001]  What did Stalin do?
[00:14:21.001 --> 00:14:21.941]  He opened up the prisons.
[00:14:23.424 --> 00:14:27.707]  Who did they use to enforce on the police and the military if they didn't follow orders?
[00:14:27.707 --> 00:14:32.350]  Hardcore brigades of hardened murderers.
[00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.031]  Who brought Hitler to power?
[00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:34.692]  The SA.
[00:14:34.692 --> 00:14:40.596]  If you look up the statistics, more than half of them were hardcore criminals.
[00:14:43.908 --> 00:14:50.451]  Now, the hardcore criminals need to know that after the full tyranny is brought in, you're going to be put in prison or killed.
[00:14:50.451 --> 00:14:51.712]  It's done everywhere.
[00:14:51.712 --> 00:14:59.116]  Soviet Union, Communist China, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, Hitler.
[00:14:59.116 --> 00:15:00.056]  You need to know this.
[00:15:00.056 --> 00:15:05.539]  I mean, they're following an exact blueprint we've seen repeated over and over again.
[00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:07.540]  Julius Caesar used the mob.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:12.203]  He used criminals as his main enforcers in Rome.
[00:15:13.885 --> 00:15:15.465]  This is not new.
[00:15:15.465 --> 00:15:19.066]  We know exactly the case of tyranny we've got, and it's a nasty one.
[00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:21.227]  It's the nastiest I've ever studied.
[00:15:21.227 --> 00:15:23.887]  And we're watching it live-time unfold, and it is bad.
[00:15:23.887 --> 00:15:33.690]  So, you know, you might want to call the FBI, as we've done live on air, and tell them, if they want to investigate Oklahoma City, I mean, we have their own internal FBI memos that have been gotten through four-year lawsuits.
[00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.812]  And in one lawsuit, they blacked out part.
[00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:39.194]  Another lawsuit, years later, they blacked out the other.
[00:15:39.194 --> 00:15:46.600]  So the lawyers were able to put both together, and the feds and Southern Poverty Law Center were running the op out of Elohim City.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.724]  As police officers told us, but of course they were murdered shortly after, Terence Yakey, Cop of the Year, and others.
[00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:58.070]  They tortured them for something fierce, but I guess it's terrorism to expose the ATF bombing that building.
[00:16:00.165 --> 00:16:05.015]  But continuing, um, ATF even tested blowing up a Ryder truck a few months before.
[00:16:05.015 --> 00:16:07.600]  That's on record, but ah, nothing suspicious.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.366]  They even tested it out in the desert on record.
[00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.199]  I mean, they think you're so stupid.
[00:16:15.199 --> 00:16:19.682]  And they think the rest of you that are awake are going to be cowards and go, well, it's true, but I'm not going to speak out against them.
[00:16:19.682 --> 00:16:20.743]  They might get me.
[00:16:20.743 --> 00:16:21.923]  They've already got us.
[00:16:21.923 --> 00:16:25.125]  All we can do is stand up against this crew of murderers.
[00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:31.008]  So, FBI, you're running all over getting everybody ready for the white Al Qaeda, telling them Tim McVeigh is about to hit.
[00:16:31.008 --> 00:16:32.869]  That means your bosses are about to hit.
[00:16:32.869 --> 00:16:37.292]  Or maybe some Brits or Israelis you're going to hire, or Germans.
[00:16:37.292 --> 00:16:38.733]  We know we've used all those groups.
[00:16:40.285 --> 00:16:44.427]  We know our government has done that, but it's not our government.
[00:16:44.427 --> 00:16:47.508]  So, I just thought I'd mention this story that we never got to last week.
[00:16:47.508 --> 00:16:51.170]  I mean, it was on InfoWars and Prison Planet, but I didn't, I wanted to hear.
[00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.811]  Florida Fusion Center surveilled Ron Paul's campaign for liberty.
[00:16:54.811 --> 00:16:59.453]  Well, good folks inside the Army leaked to us over almost two years ago that in late 2008,
[00:17:02.298 --> 00:17:14.031]  Well, in the Fed Day, in Texas, our group up in Dallas and Ron Paul in Houston, the Army was there in plain clothes and it said, do not let them know you're Army, they may kill you, they're terrorists.
[00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:17.615]  Ron Paul may just pull out six shooters and just start blasting.
[00:17:17.615 --> 00:17:20.638]  I mean, they do it with a straight face.
[00:17:20.638 --> 00:17:21.059]  Okay?
[00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:23.141]  Because Ron Paul knows who the enemy is.
[00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:24.763]  And Alex Jones knows who's the enemy.
[00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:38.081]  So every few years when I'm in a Target parking lot or in a dark parking lot at night, they like to have army guys and, you know, when suits come up and get around me and tell me I better watch myself.
[00:17:38.081 --> 00:17:39.662]  It's all just letting me know.
[00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:41.543]  Just letting me know I'm not in a free country.
[00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:50.325]  So they can ship in their narcotics and kidnap little kids all over the world and have black sites where they torture people because they like it!
[00:17:50.325 --> 00:17:53.127]  They build a world so they can have their party!
[00:17:53.127 --> 00:17:59.191]  The average good, well-meaning person that joins the military is compartmentalized, has no idea this is going on.
[00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:08.056]  But it's in the hundreds now of Army, Marine Corps, Navy investigators that do do their job with corruption all over the world and they always get killed.
[00:18:08.056 --> 00:18:09.617]  How many people got to get killed here?
[00:18:10.984 --> 00:18:16.027]  You see, and by the way, they're not going to be satisfied with all the power and raping and corruption.
[00:18:16.027 --> 00:18:17.628]  They want more!
[00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:21.671]  That's why they're out in the open going, yeah, we got black sites, yeah, we torture people.
[00:18:21.671 --> 00:18:29.716]  White House puts out memos saying you can bury people alive, you can torture their children in front of them, and then the Army report comes out and they admit that that's what's going on.
[00:18:29.716 --> 00:18:32.577]  Because they like it!
[00:18:32.577 --> 00:18:33.838]  They like it!
[00:18:33.838 --> 00:18:34.839]  You figure that out yet?
[00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:35.759]  They like it!
[00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:36.320]  And smart
[00:18:37.245 --> 00:18:44.188]  Murderers and psychos, they don't go around just grabbing women off the side of the street in their yellow Volkswagen.
[00:18:44.188 --> 00:18:47.130]  They go and they get into power.
[00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.291]  And that's basic criminology.
[00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:55.974]  They're called highly intelligent, high operation level psychopaths.
[00:18:59.076 --> 00:19:02.560]  Highly functioning psychopaths is the actual term.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.981]  And they run the world.
[00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:06.303]  And they're building a giant torture center.
[00:19:06.303 --> 00:19:09.266]  Just a giant Disney World for themselves.
[00:19:09.266 --> 00:19:11.048]  And it's their Valhalla.
[00:19:11.048 --> 00:19:12.029]  It's their heaven.
[00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:22.160]  And every time a Hitler or Stalin gets to build their Disneyland, it's just mass death, black uniforms, raping, people being stomped to death, burning cities, just...
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.462]  And then it runs like a disease and burns itself out.
[00:19:25.462 --> 00:19:27.302]  But the globalists call it the final revolution.
[00:19:27.302 --> 00:19:30.384]  In all their white papers, they say, we're not going to let that happen.
[00:19:30.384 --> 00:19:34.046]  With our high-tech system, we're going to manage it all, and it's going to get even better.
[00:19:36.946 --> 00:19:42.010]  I mean, they just can't wait to rape your wife and blow your children's heads off and torture your children in front of you.
[00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:42.951]  They love it.
[00:19:42.951 --> 00:19:45.393]  And that's why it came out in mainstream news yesterday.
[00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.995]  They're training law enforcement in the U.S.
[00:19:46.995 --> 00:19:51.799]  to, quote, kill whole Muslim families in the U.S., including their children, in cold blood.
[00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:54.241]  And the cops, when questioned, said, we're ready to do it.
[00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:57.523]  Of course, they're going to say, now it's not the Muslims.
[00:19:57.523 --> 00:19:59.385]  Go get that family on that farm.
[00:19:59.385 --> 00:19:59.785]  Get them!
[00:19:59.785 --> 00:20:00.066]  Get them!
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.521]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:03.862]  How would that make you feel?
[00:20:03.862 --> 00:20:05.583]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[00:20:05.583 --> 00:20:08.124]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:15.688]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[00:20:15.688 --> 00:20:17.189]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[00:20:17.189 --> 00:20:19.930]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:25.233]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[00:20:25.233 --> 00:20:30.296]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[00:20:30.456 --> 00:20:35.582]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:20:35.582 --> 00:20:38.004]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[00:20:38.004 --> 00:20:39.326]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:48.055]  I did not expect this at all.
[00:20:48.055 --> 00:20:52.759]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Hardened Body Extract.
[00:20:52.759 --> 00:21:00.185]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Hardened Body Extract.
[00:21:00.185 --> 00:21:01.366]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:21:01.366 --> 00:21:07.532]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:21:08.312 --> 00:21:10.874]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:21:10.874 --> 00:21:16.298]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:21:16.298 --> 00:21:19.241]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:21.562]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:21:21.562 --> 00:21:27.847]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:21:27.847 --> 00:21:31.250]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:36.774]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:21:37.034 --> 00:21:38.695]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:21:38.695 --> 00:21:40.016]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:21:40.016 --> 00:21:42.698]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:21:42.698 --> 00:21:46.941]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:51.504]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:21:51.504 --> 00:21:54.106]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:06.456]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.456 --> 00:22:14.584]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:22.431]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:22.731 --> 00:22:27.832]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:27.832 --> 00:22:33.054]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.054 --> 00:22:37.395]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:37.395 --> 00:22:38.475]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:38.475 --> 00:22:42.516]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:42.976 --> 00:22:47.880]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.883]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:50.883 --> 00:22:52.664]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.664 --> 00:22:52.905]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.905 --> 00:22:53.205]  Pure Water.
[00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:56.007]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:57.088]  And who better to help you give them
[00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:11.560]  We're good to go!
[00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:40.942]  I think so.
[00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:18.799]  We're not going to fix this country with half measures.
[00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:27.565]  Okay, let's just admit how evil and out of control and illegitimate the criminals are that have taken over the unelected bureaucracy.
[00:24:27.565 --> 00:24:29.887]  We've got links to mainstream news articles.
[00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:37.570]  To the Orlando Sentinel, to all these reports in Kurt Nemo's article from last week.
[00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:41.633]  Florida Fusion Center surveilled Ron Paul's campaign for liberty.
[00:24:41.633 --> 00:24:52.602]  They didn't just list them, if you got an American flag on your car, get us out of the UN sticker on your car, or if you're flying the Gadsden flag, or you like Bob Barr, Ron Paul.
[00:24:52.602 --> 00:24:57.085]  I mean, these are upstanding, respected people.
[00:24:57.085 --> 00:25:00.568]  That you may be a terrorist, now they're going in, they're surveilling.
[00:25:02.694 --> 00:25:11.461]  Public Intelligence, an international consortium of independent researchers, reports that a fusion center in Florida snooped on Ron Paul supporters and other political groups.
[00:25:11.461 --> 00:25:15.445]  See, and that's now been admitted in the last year by Napolitano and others.
[00:25:15.445 --> 00:25:21.070]  Over 95% of their operations are against real Americans.
[00:25:22.082 --> 00:25:33.508]  I mean, if you're really what this country was founded on, if you are a good, decent person that doesn't want foreign banks robbing us, and doesn't want to lose your liberty, and don't want the dollar destroyed, you're the enemy!
[00:25:33.508 --> 00:25:36.490]  Haven't people gotten this yet?
[00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.392]  The government is bad!
[00:25:39.392 --> 00:25:42.293]  And it's not going to get fixed just with some Republicans up there in Congress.
[00:25:42.293 --> 00:25:46.756]  Now, if you take over all the state houses through the legislative system, which is what they're really worried about,
[00:25:48.581 --> 00:25:56.124]  That's who they're surveilling, trying to get dirt to feed it out to local cops and the threat fusion centers to set you up.
[00:25:56.124 --> 00:25:59.345]  But we've got to have courage, we've got to be bold.
[00:25:59.345 --> 00:26:02.646]  But I've said it many times, it's not really courage.
[00:26:02.646 --> 00:26:05.447]  For people that aren't informed, they have to have courage to stand up.
[00:26:05.447 --> 00:26:15.991]  But when you know that these people are basically trying to set something up worse than Stalin and Hitler, then, I mean, there's nothing you can do.
[00:26:18.339 --> 00:26:22.001]  I mean, you think somebody's happy when they go open up their business at 7 a.m.
[00:26:22.001 --> 00:26:27.445]  in the morning and there's people in there robbing it, and they've got to go out to their car, get their gun, and go in and shoot them?
[00:26:27.445 --> 00:26:28.485]  No, it's just got to be done!
[00:26:28.485 --> 00:26:32.067]  And it's the same thing here in the info war.
[00:26:32.067 --> 00:26:33.948]  You think I'm happy this is going on?
[00:26:33.948 --> 00:26:35.509]  I've got to risk my life?
[00:26:35.509 --> 00:26:36.490]  No!
[00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.051]  But it's got to be done!
[00:26:38.051 --> 00:26:40.933]  They're there, they're doing it, we know they're crooks, we know they're sick!
[00:26:41.926 --> 00:26:43.287]  I mean, these are really sick.
[00:26:43.287 --> 00:26:50.154]  This isn't, look, if this was just boss hog corruption, I would know that it would take decades to lead to something worse.
[00:26:50.154 --> 00:26:52.196]  And I wouldn't be as worried.
[00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:54.118]  I'd be speaking out against it.
[00:26:54.118 --> 00:26:57.241]  This is not boss hog corruption.
[00:26:57.241 --> 00:27:00.524]  This is not Sheriff Pico Train or whatever his name is.
[00:27:00.524 --> 00:27:01.645]  Roscoe Pico Train.
[00:27:02.847 --> 00:27:06.868]  You know, writing tickets to folks that don't deserve it, making a little extra money being corrupt.
[00:27:06.868 --> 00:27:08.329]  That's bad and that's wrong.
[00:27:08.329 --> 00:27:11.630]  This is really nasty devilish stuff.
[00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.771]  This is wicked upon wicked.
[00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:17.012]  This is quadruple wicked.
[00:27:17.012 --> 00:27:20.253]  It's so wicked I can't even believe they're this wicked.
[00:27:20.253 --> 00:27:24.554]  But you notice they're operating out in the open now.
[00:27:24.554 --> 00:27:26.895]  Telling you secret arrest and torture's good.
[00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:29.396]  Admitting they're surveilling all of us without warrants and it's illegal.
[00:27:34.585 --> 00:27:41.893]  Florida Fusion Center surveilled Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty.
[00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:44.076]  The event spanned the spectrum.
[00:27:44.076 --> 00:27:46.819]  They got this through a FOIA request.
[00:27:46.819 --> 00:27:53.526]  From a summit hosted by Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty to anti-war protests conducted by Code Pink and Veterans for Peace.
[00:27:54.548 --> 00:28:07.004]  While the documents make no mention of specific threats arising from the events, they do indicate that the Fusion Center monitors political activity in a variety of forms and sometimes requests law enforcement officers to report on constitutionally protected activities.
[00:28:09.718 --> 00:28:16.722]  And it goes on to how the Central Florida Intelligence Exchange was established with an $850,000 Department of Homeland Security grant.
[00:28:16.722 --> 00:28:19.343]  Then they build them in all your local towns with more money.
[00:28:19.343 --> 00:28:21.164]  Here's another one by Curt Nemo.
[00:28:21.164 --> 00:28:32.750]  The day after this last story from last week, on December 24th, Tennessee Fusion Center puts ACLU on terrorist list.
[00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.091]  Oh yeah, the ACLU, they're real terrorist.
[00:28:35.091 --> 00:28:36.672]  I may not like them promoting abortion,
[00:28:37.665 --> 00:28:40.046]  I may not like the fact that they won't defend the Second Amendment.
[00:28:40.046 --> 00:28:43.228]  They're certainly progressive socialist types.
[00:28:43.228 --> 00:28:45.389]  But the ACLU are not terrorists.
[00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:51.092]  In fact, they've got some good branches and some good members and some good work is done by them.
[00:28:51.092 --> 00:28:54.514]  And the ACLU is what we make it.
[00:28:54.514 --> 00:29:01.838]  And the ACLU has fought the Patriot Act and all the rest of it and they're standing up against the airport grope downs.
[00:29:01.838 --> 00:29:02.939]  Well, what happens to them?
[00:29:04.835 --> 00:29:09.736]  On Thursday, we reported on a Florida fusion center snooping on Ron Paul and Campaign for Liberty.
[00:29:09.736 --> 00:29:14.697]  Now we discover a fusion center in Tennessee has put the ACLU on a terror list.
[00:29:14.697 --> 00:29:18.398]  As terrorists!
[00:29:18.398 --> 00:29:30.240]  The Chattanooga Free Press reported that Tennessee anti-terrorism officials, officials, not servants, officials, placed the legislative lobbying organization on an internet map detailing terrorism entities and other suspicious activity.
[00:29:32.714 --> 00:29:37.536]  And the group warns schools to ensure holiday celebrations are inclusive.
[00:29:37.536 --> 00:29:42.357]  Gotta watch out about that.
[00:29:42.357 --> 00:29:43.878]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:43.878 --> 00:29:44.378]  Stay with us.
[00:29:44.378 --> 00:29:48.320]  We've got bombshell intel on Barry Sitaro, a.k.a.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.121]  Barack Obama, the birth certificate.
[00:29:51.121 --> 00:29:52.521]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.521 --> 00:29:55.042]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.042 --> 00:29:57.723]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.592 --> 00:30:05.135]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:05.135 --> 00:30:06.055]  Number 1.
[00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:09.478]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.478 --> 00:30:10.338]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.338 --> 00:30:15.241]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.241 --> 00:30:15.982]  It's true.
[00:30:15.982 --> 00:30:20.845]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.845 --> 00:30:21.685]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.685 --> 00:30:25.268]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.268 --> 00:30:28.970]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:29.951]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.951 --> 00:30:32.713]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.713 --> 00:30:36.396]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.396 --> 00:30:37.197]  Number 5.
[00:30:37.197 --> 00:30:41.341]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:46.105]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:33:00.534 --> 00:33:06.556]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:33:06.556 --> 00:33:09.117]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:10.228 --> 00:33:29.467]  Before I go to Attorney Phil Berg and Doctor of History, Webster Griffin Tarpley, expert on Barack Hussein Obama, real name Barry Sitaro, with big developments on the birth certificate issue, huge developments, and before they leave us we'll play part of a Chris Matthews clip from just yesterday.
[00:33:31.832 --> 00:33:43.022]  I was covering Tennessee Fusion Center puts ACLU on terror list, and they put them on the list for telling schools to make the holiday season inclusive.
[00:33:43.022 --> 00:33:45.144]  Now, that's political manipulation.
[00:33:45.144 --> 00:33:54.252]  They know in the polls, and I've seen national polls of above 75% outraged by banning Christmas, banning red and green in schools.
[00:33:54.252 --> 00:33:54.833]  That's going on.
[00:33:55.919 --> 00:34:03.182]  So they do little politically correct things that are seen as politically correct by conservatives to make it look legitimate.
[00:34:03.182 --> 00:34:06.023]  Meanwhile, they're spying on Ron Paul, liberals.
[00:34:06.023 --> 00:34:09.664]  They spy on everybody.
[00:34:09.664 --> 00:34:11.605]  That's how this political correctness works.
[00:34:11.605 --> 00:34:13.566]  So I just wanted to add that final point.
[00:34:13.566 --> 00:34:15.747]  You know, that sounds reasonable to conservatives.
[00:34:15.747 --> 00:34:17.548]  Yeah, the ACLU are terrorists.
[00:34:17.548 --> 00:34:19.288]  They want to restrict Christmas.
[00:34:19.288 --> 00:34:20.909]  This is all part of a PSYOP.
[00:34:22.421 --> 00:34:26.923]  Now, we've got Mike Adams coming up for 30 minutes in the next hour.
[00:34:26.923 --> 00:34:34.887]  Then Porter Stansbury on the fact that the dollar is moving towards losing its World Reserve currency status.
[00:34:34.887 --> 00:34:45.591]  We've got former top Dallas Cowboy lineman Mark Stepnoski and an engineer coming on to talk about new 9-11 truth developments and an operation they're launching.
[00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:48.933]  So that news will be broken here coming up in the last
[00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:52.731]  I'm
[00:35:14.796 --> 00:35:31.224]  Recently talking about this new governor and now the governor Democrat Neil Abercrombie has vowed to release the birth certificate So that's the new development and and the big change here is the full clips up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com It's about eight minutes long.
[00:35:31.224 --> 00:35:39.427]  We're supposed to play a minute or two several times Matthew says you could you get in the CIA with just a receipt of birth certificate?
[00:35:39.427 --> 00:35:42.309]  They finally admitted that it's a
[00:35:43.189 --> 00:35:54.111]  Receipt, not the birth certificate, not the blueprint, not the photostat, not the one with the signatures and the feet print like all of us have.
[00:35:54.111 --> 00:35:58.472]  It's a receipt of it, okay?
[00:35:58.472 --> 00:36:07.753]  And you can't get in the FBI with one of those, you can't get in the CIA with one of those, you certainly can't be president with one of those, and it's the Constitution.
[00:36:07.753 --> 00:36:11.494]  Now, I don't know if he was really born in Kenya or not, the evidence shows he was.
[00:36:12.978 --> 00:36:16.419]  But I know he gave up his citizenship in Indonesia and became Barry Sotero.
[00:36:16.419 --> 00:36:18.780]  And then now there's another name we find out about.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.421]  So, that right there under law means he can't be president.
[00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:23.822]  But I'm about to go to both these men briefly for the rest of the hour.
[00:36:23.822 --> 00:36:27.543]  But here is the clip of them basically panicking.
[00:36:27.543 --> 00:36:30.184]  Some polls show 60%, some 50%.
[00:36:30.184 --> 00:36:32.645]  The poll they cite is only 20-something percent.
[00:36:32.645 --> 00:36:36.686]  Don't believe he's really an American or natural born.
[00:36:36.686 --> 00:36:41.808]  So, here they are going from stonewalling for over two years and saying, you've got the birth certificate.
[00:36:42.694 --> 00:36:45.536]  Is this going to help if we get more documentation?
[00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:50.860]  And second question, why has the president himself not demanded that they put out the initial documents already?
[00:37:03.609 --> 00:37:08.932]  The president's got more important things to do, thank goodness that he's more focused on that.
[00:37:08.932 --> 00:37:15.075]  Governor Abercrombie himself says that, and points out that it is he, the governor, who's bringing this issue up.
[00:37:15.075 --> 00:37:15.676]  Alright, pause.
[00:37:15.676 --> 00:37:18.858]  For just a second, I'm going to finish the clip.
[00:37:18.858 --> 00:37:24.941]  You can make a phone call and write a letter, and in about a month, a copy of your original birth certificate comes.
[00:37:24.941 --> 00:37:27.923]  I know, because I lost mine once and had to get it.
[00:37:27.923 --> 00:37:28.143]  Okay?
[00:37:29.551 --> 00:37:33.972]  And they don't take a receipt of a birth certificate to get a new passport or driver's license.
[00:37:33.972 --> 00:37:36.193]  They want the original.
[00:37:36.193 --> 00:37:36.853]  Okay?
[00:37:36.853 --> 00:37:39.814]  Or to get in school, they want the original.
[00:37:39.814 --> 00:37:45.515]  So he was too busy to have one of his thousands of employees get it, and this has been an issue even during the campaign.
[00:37:45.515 --> 00:37:48.296]  Huge issue, he just has got more important things.
[00:37:48.296 --> 00:37:49.556]  Let's continue.
[00:37:49.556 --> 00:37:56.318]  He saw Obama as a baby, and he is tired of people literally lambasting Obama's parents for
[00:37:56.938 --> 00:37:58.479]  No good reason.
[00:37:58.479 --> 00:38:01.682]  And so he wants to try to put this to rest.
[00:38:01.682 --> 00:38:08.647]  Of course, it won't work because the birthers aren't interested in evidence that Obama was born a U.S.
[00:38:08.647 --> 00:38:09.488]  citizen.
[00:38:09.488 --> 00:38:12.070]  They only want to hear evidence that he was not.
[00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.471]  And that's not going to happen.
[00:38:14.127 --> 00:38:19.491]  Well, what about going to that 20% or 23% we showed in the New York Times, Paul, that doesn't know?
[00:38:19.491 --> 00:38:21.273]  They just want evidence.
[00:38:21.273 --> 00:38:24.095]  Is that a group that has a right to get more documentation?
[00:38:24.095 --> 00:38:27.158]  And would Robert Crombie's position here be the right one?
[00:38:27.158 --> 00:38:28.018]  David.
[00:38:28.018 --> 00:38:30.360]  Well, listen, there's enough evidence out there already.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.422]  There's the certificate that you're holding up.
[00:38:32.422 --> 00:38:37.266]  But perhaps even more importantly, there are two birth announcements in Honolulu newspapers.
[00:38:37.726 --> 00:38:48.493]  Imagine the conspiratorial mind that would have to, at the time of his birth, it was in 1961, plant those things so that one day he could become President of the United States.
[00:38:48.493 --> 00:38:51.575]  So there's already plenty of information out there.
[00:38:51.575 --> 00:38:53.397]  Not become President of the U.S.?
[00:38:53.397 --> 00:38:54.938]  This is routine.
[00:38:54.938 --> 00:39:01.322]  Get the kid back in the country, falsify that he was born here so he could be a natural born and get all those benefits.
[00:39:01.322 --> 00:39:05.465]  And more than half the family are on record being CIA and big foundation operatives.
[00:39:06.656 --> 00:39:20.170]  And then finally, I'm not going to play the whole clip because we're running out of time here, but Matthews goes on and says, well, you couldn't get in the CIA with this receipt, you know, and he holds up a copy of his that is the photostat and says, we need to see this.
[00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:25.395]  So, I want to bring up Phil Berg and Webster Tarpley.
[00:39:25.395 --> 00:39:30.758]  Phil Berg, going back two and a half years, he was the first to really question things.
[00:39:30.758 --> 00:39:38.622]  Tarpley looked into it, began questioning it, has written books on the subject, and this whole thing is very, very suspicious.
[00:39:38.622 --> 00:39:49.387]  But briefly from both of you, a two-minute statement from you, Phil Berg, attorney at law, on what you think this signifies, then a two-minute statement from Tarpley on this, and then I've got other questions.
[00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:50.773]  Sure, thanks.
[00:39:50.773 --> 00:39:52.215]  This is Phil Berg.
[00:39:52.215 --> 00:39:53.035]  I appreciate it.
[00:39:53.035 --> 00:39:59.881]  I filed my first lawsuit August 21st, 2008, before he was even nominated to the Democratic National Committee.
[00:39:59.881 --> 00:40:06.307]  And I sued Obama and the Democratic National Committee, but they were cohorts together.
[00:40:06.947 --> 00:40:09.169]  Um, I think there's significance to this.
[00:40:09.169 --> 00:40:10.309]  First off, I agree with you.
[00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:15.753]  The birth certificate issue is really not the issue because he was adopted in Indonesia.
[00:40:15.753 --> 00:40:19.536]  And whatever citizenship he had in the United States, he lost at that time.
[00:40:19.536 --> 00:40:21.797]  He could have renewed it between the ages of 18 and 21.
[00:40:21.797 --> 00:40:24.139]  There's no evidence he ever did.
[00:40:24.139 --> 00:40:26.400]  There's no evidence he ever changed his name.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.242]  I believe his legal name was Barry Sotoro.
[00:40:29.242 --> 00:40:34.085]  Where you can use an alias, you can use an alias, but not for fraudulent purposes.
[00:40:34.085 --> 00:40:35.106]  And that's what he's doing.
[00:40:35.106 --> 00:40:36.567]  And that's why everything's so sealed.
[00:40:37.187 --> 00:40:43.931]  Right, and I think the significance with Chris Matthews saying it, I think he's falling into a trap, which is wonderful.
[00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:51.734]  I think Abercrombie really believes that Obama was born in Hawaii, and he wants records released, and he's going to have a rude awakening.
[00:40:51.734 --> 00:40:54.836]  You don't see Obama just saying, okay, I'll release it, because
[00:40:55.581 --> 00:41:00.185]  Up until one point, they only said out there, we looked at his vital record.
[00:41:00.185 --> 00:41:02.927]  They never said we looked at his birth certificate.
[00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:18.599]  And I think the significance of that is that I think they have the Kenya birth certificate locked up there in Hawaii, which they perhaps did when they got a short form or the document, like the document they produced.
[00:41:18.599 --> 00:41:20.981]  It's just, it's outrageous, but I think now,
[00:41:22.663 --> 00:41:23.803]  It's coming our way.
[00:41:23.803 --> 00:41:25.264]  More and more people are coming our way.
[00:41:25.264 --> 00:41:27.424]  Obama's dropping in the polls.
[00:41:27.424 --> 00:41:29.965]  His real name is Sotaro.
[00:41:29.965 --> 00:41:32.425]  I have one case significant still going.
[00:41:32.425 --> 00:41:34.305]  We just need to raise the money for it to the U.S.
[00:41:34.305 --> 00:41:35.406]  Supreme Court.
[00:41:35.406 --> 00:41:37.946]  Well, we have the school records that it's Sotaro.
[00:41:37.946 --> 00:41:40.687]  And you were laughed at two years ago about that.
[00:41:40.687 --> 00:41:42.247]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:41:42.247 --> 00:41:46.028]  They've been trying to psychologically inoculate people to this now.
[00:41:46.328 --> 00:41:47.729]  Just a year ago, we were kooks.
[00:41:47.729 --> 00:41:50.031]  Now it's, oh, his name is Barry Sotaro.
[00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:54.574]  He did worship at the Muslim mosque.
[00:41:54.574 --> 00:41:57.977]  His mother didn't like it, but he said, I'm a Muslim.
[00:41:57.977 --> 00:41:59.878]  And I'm not saying it's bad that he's a Muslim.
[00:41:59.878 --> 00:42:01.379]  The point is he lied about it.
[00:42:01.379 --> 00:42:06.203]  Now all of that's coming out in the newspapers, but they're spinning it like it's cute and sweet.
[00:42:06.203 --> 00:42:07.524]  Let's get Tarpley's take on that.
[00:42:08.493 --> 00:42:09.893]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:42:09.893 --> 00:42:14.295]  I think that the big issue behind all of this is the blackmail of Obama.
[00:42:14.295 --> 00:42:22.978]  That whatever you think about this one way or the other, it's clear that he is blackmailed, that he cannot produce a birth certificate for whatever reason.
[00:42:22.978 --> 00:42:26.999]  They won't release high school, college, they seal it all, they act like it's... Quite right.
[00:42:27.579 --> 00:42:34.566]  But especially on this constitutional issue of the natural-born citizen, it seems to me that there's a cartel.
[00:42:34.566 --> 00:42:46.037]  Foreign intelligence agencies, you can just go through a list of countries, maybe groups in the Pentagon, certainly groups in Wall Street, are blackmailing Obama to kingdom come.
[00:42:46.037 --> 00:42:49.361]  And there's a very significant vested interest in this.
[00:42:50.021 --> 00:42:56.707]  If you look at, you know, the Rupert Murdoch news media, they don't seem to be that interested in the birth certificate issue.
[00:42:56.707 --> 00:43:02.453]  I think the main reason is that Rupert Murdoch and his cohorts are blackmailing Obama to a fairly well.
[00:43:02.453 --> 00:43:05.536]  Look at this tax monstrosity that just went through.
[00:43:05.536 --> 00:43:07.137]  Tax cuts for the rich.
[00:43:07.137 --> 00:43:09.880]  Tax cuts for Paris Hilton.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:15.485]  As Mitch McConnell, the Republican, said, when they had Bush and control of two houses of Congress,
[00:43:15.905 --> 00:43:22.768]  The Republicans could not get the deal on the estate tax that they just got from Obama with a Democratic majority.
[00:43:22.768 --> 00:43:27.529]  Well, Webster, you know I disagree with your big government views, but I want to talk about this issue.
[00:43:27.529 --> 00:43:30.551]  This is Obama betraying his own base.
[00:43:30.551 --> 00:43:31.631]  No, I understand that.
[00:43:31.631 --> 00:43:33.332]  The guy was financed by Wall Street.
[00:43:33.332 --> 00:43:33.932]  What do you expect?
[00:43:34.512 --> 00:43:39.555]  It's a better deal than the Republicans got, even under Bush.
[00:43:39.555 --> 00:43:43.537]  This, I think, indicates the dimensions of blackmail, right?
[00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:50.101]  Endless war in Afghanistan, these sellouts on the home front, all calculated to enrage his Democratic base.
[00:43:50.101 --> 00:43:52.843]  Now, the other side is the Republicans are coming to town.
[00:43:53.643 --> 00:43:56.566]  All eyes here in Washington are on Daryl Issa.
[00:43:56.566 --> 00:44:02.690]  Daryl Issa is going to be the head of the House Government Operations Committee.
[00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:11.878]  And it normally would be up to Daryl Issa to step up and say, I'm the Congressman from California, I'm the head of this new committee here, and I just want to see Obama's
[00:44:12.498 --> 00:44:13.259]  We're good to go.
[00:44:42.558 --> 00:44:47.264]  Obama ran on saying, I'm not Bush, and now with his tax bill he says, I am Bush!
[00:44:47.264 --> 00:44:47.804]  Surprise!
[00:44:47.804 --> 00:44:48.946]  I really am Bush!
[00:44:48.946 --> 00:44:50.868]  So this is, this is political suicide.
[00:44:50.868 --> 00:44:56.114]  But Webster, let me go back here and have you finish up your comment, and then go back to Berg, and then we'll come back to you.
[00:44:57.455 --> 00:45:12.437]  My question for you is, and I didn't have time to play the whole clip, what does it signify to have them change course in the middle of the stream and go from stonewalling and calling this receipt of a certificate
[00:45:13.712 --> 00:45:19.015]  A certificate, and now admitting that we haven't seen his real birth certificate.
[00:45:19.015 --> 00:45:21.396]  It is a test, I think, and a test.
[00:45:21.396 --> 00:45:23.697]  It says that we have on deposit someplace else.
[00:45:23.697 --> 00:45:25.238]  This is not the document.
[00:45:25.238 --> 00:45:26.298]  It's the idea behind it.
[00:45:26.298 --> 00:45:28.159]  Well, two things.
[00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:41.566]  One is, it could be the Clinton machine or some other Democratic machine that is beginning to soften him up, beginning to encourage somebody to come forward to challenge him in the Democratic primaries, which is, I think, absolutely essential.
[00:45:42.066 --> 00:45:42.927]  Well, Tarpley, I mean, you predict...
[00:46:03.643 --> 00:46:04.043]  We're good to go.
[00:46:18.769 --> 00:46:23.393]  No, I think you really see a change, and I think it's significant.
[00:46:23.393 --> 00:46:37.024]  I think perhaps you're right on the Clinton thing, because there's word that she's going to step down as Secretary of State, and that could be setting up for her to run for President to get out of the administration right now.
[00:46:37.024 --> 00:46:37.925]  But the big thing is,
[00:46:38.545 --> 00:46:46.989]  There's so many people in this country that agree with us that Obama is a fraud, a phony, he's the biggest hoax against the United States of America in our history.
[00:46:46.989 --> 00:46:48.429]  He's an imposter!
[00:46:48.429 --> 00:46:55.852]  And think about it, when he first took office, he insisted on having his BlackBerry, which you see on his belt as he's walking around, because as
[00:46:57.373 --> 00:47:02.697]  Webster stated, I believe he's being blackmailed by the power to be in this country.
[00:47:02.697 --> 00:47:05.279]  The power to be are money people.
[00:47:05.279 --> 00:47:07.181]  And he's told what to do.
[00:47:07.181 --> 00:47:09.943]  Most of his speeches are off the teleprompter.
[00:47:09.943 --> 00:47:11.264]  They're written by someone else.
[00:47:11.264 --> 00:47:12.385]  He delivers a good speech.
[00:47:12.745 --> 00:47:13.365]  We're good to go.
[00:47:31.694 --> 00:47:32.294]  False.
[00:47:32.294 --> 00:47:35.436]  They'd be after me, they'd be suing me, but they haven't done that.
[00:47:35.436 --> 00:47:36.757]  And we're on the right track.
[00:47:36.757 --> 00:47:40.819]  And I just mentioned briefly, it's real significant, the case I have getting ready for the U.S.
[00:47:40.819 --> 00:47:48.825]  Supreme Court, because it was turned down, I'm claiming that Obama is not only not natural born, he's not naturalized, and therefore his term as U.S.
[00:47:48.825 --> 00:47:53.588]  Senator was fraud, and therefore the salary and benefits of a million dollars should go back to U.S.
[00:47:53.588 --> 00:47:54.408]  Treasury.
[00:47:54.408 --> 00:47:55.729]  Obviously, if he couldn't be a U.S.
[00:47:55.729 --> 00:47:57.030]  Senator, he can't be President.
[00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:01.153]  And everything he's signed, everything he's signed is null and void.
[00:48:01.153 --> 00:48:09.798]  And whether it's from the left perspective or the right perspective, anyone who looks at that health care bill knows it was written by insurance companies.
[00:48:09.798 --> 00:48:11.139]  It's a scam.
[00:48:11.139 --> 00:48:15.122]  Even if you're a socialist out there, you know, it's not what you were asking for.
[00:48:15.122 --> 00:48:16.603]  We need to get rid of it.
[00:48:16.603 --> 00:48:19.465]  And so, Tarpoli, is this not good news, though?
[00:48:19.465 --> 00:48:24.088]  If Obama is brought down because then so much of what he's done is discredited?
[00:48:24.875 --> 00:48:28.377]  Certainly to get Obama out now would be a public service.
[00:48:28.377 --> 00:48:37.542]  To have this issue come to the fore finally, to have Phil Berg's work of many years now put back in the public spotlight.
[00:48:37.542 --> 00:48:40.544]  Because otherwise it's going to be a disaster from every point of view.
[00:48:40.544 --> 00:48:44.406]  And again, if you are blackmailed in this way, you can't be president.
[00:48:44.406 --> 00:48:47.127]  You can't carry out the constitutional office.
[00:48:47.127 --> 00:48:52.030]  If you're constantly blackmailed by virtually every secret intelligence agency in the world,
[00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:56.531]  Wall Street and God knows what other cliques are doing this.
[00:48:56.531 --> 00:49:10.596]  So, unfortunately, it's a painful process, but I'm afraid this is the situation we're now in, and the path of, what can we say, least damage to the country and the Constitution is for Obama to be removed from office.
[00:49:10.596 --> 00:49:17.558]  And again, I would like to see Daryl Issa, if he's such a fire-breathing guarantor of the public interest,
[00:49:18.058 --> 00:49:21.200]  How about a quick subpoena for a birth certificate?
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.720]  Let's get to the bottom of this.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.401]  That could be done next week.
[00:49:24.401 --> 00:49:26.422]  Republicans take over next week.
[00:49:26.422 --> 00:49:28.903]  So Darrell Issa, where's the subpoena?
[00:49:28.903 --> 00:49:29.324]  That's right.
[00:49:29.324 --> 00:49:39.889]  If they don't move directly to demand the birth certificate, which is just a fact-finding mission, then we know they're wanting to hold this back there to continue the blackmailing.
[00:49:40.089 --> 00:49:40.729]  Exactly.
[00:49:40.729 --> 00:49:47.310]  Because it's a very lucrative thing, and they think that they're going to get a lot more things that they want over the next two years.
[00:49:47.310 --> 00:50:01.673]  Again, that tax bill is the first attack on Social Security in terms of the old age pensions, and I think there are people, Peter Peterson and the Koch brothers and all sorts of people... And they're selling it, just like in New Jersey, that this will fix the deficit.
[00:50:01.673 --> 00:50:06.954]  If you don't get rid of the debt black hole, the fractional reserve banking, and the derivatives, you could cut everything.
[00:50:06.954 --> 00:50:08.074]  It's not going to pay anything off.
[00:50:08.274 --> 00:50:15.116]  Yeah, the lesson of history is the more you cut, the bigger the deficit is in the out years when you come back in the following year.
[00:50:15.116 --> 00:50:17.757]  So, this makes no sense.
[00:50:17.757 --> 00:50:21.278]  So, nothing but terrible tragedy with Obama.
[00:50:21.278 --> 00:50:29.941]  So, any hack politician, a normal hack bureaucrat politician would be better than Obama, and there's a broad array.
[00:50:29.941 --> 00:50:32.502]  So let's get to the bottom of this fast.
[00:50:32.502 --> 00:50:34.523]  And the heat is on the Republicans now.
[00:50:34.523 --> 00:50:35.903]  They made big promises.
[00:50:35.903 --> 00:50:36.884]  Let's see what they're made of.
[00:50:38.144 --> 00:50:45.413]  First we want the birth certificate in the public domain, and then we want this other issue on the naturalization in Indonesia.
[00:50:45.413 --> 00:50:52.180]  Yeah, and if the Republicans don't do that, notice Glenn Beck admonishes his audience almost every day, do not go after the birth certificate.
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.302]  Do not go after it.
[00:50:53.302 --> 00:50:55.864]  Because they want to keep using that card.
[00:50:55.864 --> 00:50:56.846]  We want to play the card.
[00:50:56.846 --> 00:50:58.768]  We'll be right back with Phil Berg and Webster Tarpley.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:06.061]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:59.558 --> 00:52:01.900]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:08.864]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:52:08.864 --> 00:52:11.446]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:52:11.446 --> 00:52:16.629]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:19.771]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:52:19.771 --> 00:52:22.113]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:52:22.113 --> 00:52:28.399]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:52:28.399 --> 00:52:31.801]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:52:31.801 --> 00:52:37.606]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:52:37.606 --> 00:52:39.267]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:52:39.267 --> 00:52:40.588]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:52:40.588 --> 00:52:43.251]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:52:43.251 --> 00:52:44.672]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:52:44.872 --> 00:52:45.433]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.389 --> 00:53:03.610]  This is not a drill.
[00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:06.112]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:53:06.112 --> 00:53:08.014]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:53:08.014 --> 00:53:15.239]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:53:15.239 --> 00:53:19.623]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:53:19.623 --> 00:53:29.911]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:53:30.131 --> 00:53:31.772]  Under any circumstance.
[00:53:31.772 --> 00:53:38.978]  These and other closely guarded gun cashing secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:53:38.978 --> 00:53:39.679]  But listen up.
[00:53:39.679 --> 00:53:45.924]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:53:45.924 --> 00:53:47.765]  Go to HideYourGuns.com.
[00:53:47.765 --> 00:53:49.947]  That's HideYourGuns.com.
[00:53:49.947 --> 00:53:50.447]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:53:50.447 --> 00:53:52.269]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:53:52.269 --> 00:53:52.929]  HideYourGuns.com.
[00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:53.510]  Right now.
[00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:22.816]  We're almost out of time with Webster Tarpley and Phil Berg.
[00:54:22.816 --> 00:54:30.162]  In closing, gentlemen, not what you want to happen, but what do you in your gut see happening with Obama?
[00:54:30.162 --> 00:54:34.525]  The lowest approval rating in history for a president at this point.
[00:54:34.525 --> 00:54:36.947]  The fastest continual dropping in history.
[00:54:36.947 --> 00:54:41.230]  I mean, in another year or so, this guy, I can't see him with above a 20 point
[00:54:43.812 --> 00:54:45.574]  Approval rating.
[00:54:45.574 --> 00:54:46.195]  I agree with you.
[00:54:46.195 --> 00:54:46.896]  He's a puppet.
[00:54:46.896 --> 00:54:55.487]  Get him out of there so that we can, you know, actually engage the globalists instead of them just blaming everything on their minion.
[00:54:55.487 --> 00:54:58.330]  In closing, Phil Berg, how do you see this ending?
[00:54:59.111 --> 00:55:01.172]  Well, I've been hopeful since 2008.
[00:55:01.172 --> 00:55:04.053]  I think we need to spread the word.
[00:55:04.053 --> 00:55:05.434]  You do a terrific job on that.
[00:55:05.434 --> 00:55:07.035]  We have to get more and more people involved.
[00:55:07.035 --> 00:55:10.596]  We have to put pressure on the Republicans, on Isaac, to do it.
[00:55:10.596 --> 00:55:14.218]  Or we'll see that Clinton and others are going to try to do away.
[00:55:14.218 --> 00:55:16.099]  Clinton would have a lot of control.
[00:55:16.099 --> 00:55:18.540]  And he could do that and get them exposed.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.361]  But we have to do it because it's a disaster what's going on.
[00:55:21.361 --> 00:55:25.443]  If we get him out of office, everything he's done is void or voidable.
[00:55:25.443 --> 00:55:26.984]  It's voidable, so it would be void.
[00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:31.587]  And we have to do it, and my website is obamacrimes.com.
[00:55:31.587 --> 00:55:34.668]  If they go there, they can check the latest of my lawsuit, which is going to the U.S.
[00:55:34.668 --> 00:55:35.809]  Supreme Court.
[00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:40.032]  And I think that's a shot we have, but the courts have not been with us.
[00:55:40.032 --> 00:55:48.977]  They've been in the pocket of Obama, but perhaps now things will change, because the powers that be may want to change, and they'll go our way.
[00:55:48.977 --> 00:55:50.358]  So keep our fingers crossed.
[00:55:50.899 --> 00:55:52.200]  Thank you so much, Phil Byrd.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.161]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[00:55:53.161 --> 00:55:54.542]  Have a good New Year.
[00:55:54.542 --> 00:55:55.762]  Thank you.
[00:55:55.762 --> 00:56:02.887]  Webster, from the beginning, I thought they were building Obama up as messianic to later destroy him.
[00:56:02.887 --> 00:56:12.254]  I predicted that over a year and a half ago in the Obama deception, when his approval rating was still at about 70 points when that film came out, or above 70.
[00:56:12.254 --> 00:56:15.136]  I believe this has all been scripted.
[00:56:15.136 --> 00:56:16.417]  Do you have a different view of that?
[00:56:16.417 --> 00:56:18.218]  A, and B, how do you see it ending?
[00:56:18.738 --> 00:56:37.652]  Well, it's inevitable that when Obama ran for president with all of these messianic promises, utopian delusions, you know, the Messiah and all this, that there would be a very severe letdown, which would be much more severe than the usual disillusionment with the president when they
[00:56:38.272 --> 00:56:47.503]  When they begin to break their promises with Obama, this is very, very significant because here the mistaken identity case was very severe.
[00:56:47.503 --> 00:56:50.066]  Now, there are two things that could happen now.
[00:56:50.066 --> 00:56:57.675]  One is Daryl Issa and these Republicans take their constitutional responsibilities seriously and there's some chance that they might
[00:56:59.122 --> 00:57:03.765]  And they delve into this, get that birth certificate out there.
[00:57:03.765 --> 00:57:11.790]  The chances are, though, as you mentioned, if Glenn Beck says, stay away from the issue, that means Rupert Murdoch is saying, stay away from the issue.
[00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:19.955]  That means the Rupert Murdoch, George Shultz, Koch brothers faction in the ruling class, they say, we want two more years of blackmail.
[00:57:19.955 --> 00:57:23.637]  And we want to guarantee that the Republicans
[00:57:24.897 --> 00:57:25.838]  It's worse than that.
[00:57:25.838 --> 00:57:31.080]  Karl Rove is attacking anybody who may run against Obama and the Democrats everywhere.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.721]  He wants six more years.
[00:57:33.721 --> 00:57:35.061]  Right.
[00:57:35.061 --> 00:57:40.983]  So, one is Darrell Issa does something that would be a surprise to me.
[00:57:40.983 --> 00:57:51.087]  The other one is maybe the Clintons, if they see that Obama is hemorrhaging and collapsing into the springtime and maybe into the early summer, they may then
[00:57:51.827 --> 00:57:55.369]  Do you like Russ Feingold because he voted against the Patriot Act?
[00:58:23.217 --> 00:58:26.879]  He has some signs in his resume that he's an independent figure.
[00:58:26.879 --> 00:58:29.340]  And again, I don't really care who it is.
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:32.222]  Structurally, the important thing is somebody should do it.
[00:58:32.222 --> 00:58:33.162]  It doesn't really matter who.
[00:58:33.162 --> 00:58:35.383]  Yeah, because Obama is a complete puppet.
[00:58:35.383 --> 00:58:37.224]  All right, Webster, have a great New Year coming up.
[00:58:37.224 --> 00:58:38.545]  We'll be right back with a second hour.
[00:58:38.545 --> 00:58:40.806]  Stay with us.
[00:58:40.806 --> 00:58:42.867]  The GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:42.867 --> 00:58:45.748]  Providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:58:45.748 --> 00:58:48.130]  GCN.
[00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:50.311]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:58:52.984 --> 00:58:54.724]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[00:59:00.446 --> 00:59:05.187]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[00:59:05.187 --> 00:59:08.928]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:56.210]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.210 --> 01:00:05.555]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.555 --> 01:00:06.855]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.855 --> 01:00:08.636]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.636 --> 01:00:09.797]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.797 --> 01:00:11.978]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.978 --> 01:00:13.899]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.899 --> 01:00:17.701]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:21.783]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:36.225]  Well, I really enjoyed having him in studio a few months with us, a few months ago with us, and I look forward to having him back in studio.
[01:00:36.225 --> 01:00:40.668]  But for the next 30 minutes, he joins us via telephone.
[01:00:40.668 --> 01:00:43.429]  He, of course, is the editor of NaturalNews.com.
[01:00:43.429 --> 01:00:47.332]  We post a lot of their great reports at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:48.661 --> 01:00:56.728]  I want to get in this short segment into a swine flu pandemic outbreak sweeping through Britain.
[01:00:56.728 --> 01:01:06.817]  Even though 70% were vaccinated last year, you have the Canadian studies and government studies in Europe showing that it lowers your immunity by about 50%.
[01:01:06.817 --> 01:01:12.502]  When you take the H1N1 shot to the regular seasonal flu, now you don't have a choice, they're combining both.
[01:01:13.343 --> 01:01:16.364]  And so I wanted to talk just briefly with Mike Adams about that.
[01:01:16.364 --> 01:01:19.745]  Then we're going to come back with the big story here.
[01:01:19.745 --> 01:01:22.466]  Homeland Security and U.S.
[01:01:22.466 --> 01:01:26.847]  Treasury are involved with a food safety bill invoking codex, that's U.N.
[01:01:26.847 --> 01:01:32.429]  takeover, harmonization and grants, FDA authority to police food safety of foreign nations.
[01:01:32.429 --> 01:01:34.530]  Kind of like we just discovered that the
[01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:41.944]  Drug Enforcement Agency is running around as a global spy agency, non-drug related.
[01:01:41.944 --> 01:01:44.425]  This is a global corporate government with a U.S.
[01:01:44.425 --> 01:01:45.646]  taxpayer fit in the bill.
[01:01:45.646 --> 01:01:47.067]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:47.067 --> 01:01:50.168]  But let's look at flu season first.
[01:01:50.168 --> 01:01:59.614]  Obviously record low numbers of people took it here last year because of your work and others exposing it as dangerous, which has now been proved by the British Medical Journal, the EU Medical Board and others.
[01:01:59.614 --> 01:02:02.855]  But Mike, now they're back fear-mongering.
[01:02:02.855 --> 01:02:03.536]  Tell us about that.
[01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:05.154]  Well, they are.
[01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:07.158]  They are fear-mongering as usual, Alex.
[01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:08.560]  You're right on target.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.732]  Even though about 70% of the over 65 population was vaccinated last year in the UK.
[01:02:15.891 --> 01:02:20.215]  They're already saying that there's a new pandemic sweeping through the country.
[01:02:20.215 --> 01:02:23.818]  Several hundred people are in hospitals now suffering from swine flu.
[01:02:23.818 --> 01:02:26.900]  But there's a number that they never tell you.
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:33.826]  They never say how many of those sick people were vaccinated either this year or last year.
[01:02:33.826 --> 01:02:37.729]  Because there's something that I call the reinfection rate.
[01:02:37.729 --> 01:02:39.010]  And it's a very high number.
[01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:41.472]  We don't know how high it is because they won't release the number.
[01:02:41.472 --> 01:02:42.573]  They won't do the studies on this.
[01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:52.761]  People who are vaccinated have a weakened immune system when they face future exposure to infectious disease.
[01:02:52.761 --> 01:02:55.723]  So, I'm sure your listeners are on board with this.
[01:02:55.723 --> 01:02:56.904]  They're well informed.
[01:02:56.904 --> 01:02:58.225]  They already know this.
[01:02:58.225 --> 01:03:02.188]  But the mainstream conventional medical community denies this.
[01:03:02.188 --> 01:03:06.451]  They try to imply that if you're vaccinated, it's 100%.
[01:03:06.451 --> 01:03:09.233]  You know, you take the shot, you won't get sick.
[01:03:09.233 --> 01:03:10.534]  Well, that's a fraud.
[01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:12.548]  In fact, it's marketing fraud.
[01:03:12.548 --> 01:03:25.757]  If the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, actually enforced, you know, false marketing regulations against the drug companies, they would go after them for making those claims because vaccines don't work 100%.
[01:03:25.757 --> 01:03:37.485]  In fact, if you look at the science, and I have, and I've written about it, and you have too, they're about 1% effective if you believe the drug company's own studies.
[01:03:37.485 --> 01:03:40.187]  So for every 100 people who are vaccinated,
[01:03:40.928 --> 01:03:44.490]  You're going to reduce flu symptoms in about one person.
[01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:46.491]  But that's on the benefit end.
[01:03:46.491 --> 01:03:58.098]  When you look at the negative effects, as you know, but for those that don't, every major study out there shows vaccines lower overall immunity, including to the things that they're supposedly protecting you from.
[01:03:58.098 --> 01:04:04.302]  And the anecdotal on the street is it's common knowledge that I took the flu shot and got the flu.
[01:04:04.302 --> 01:04:05.503]  I mean, it's common sense.
[01:04:06.483 --> 01:04:07.504]  Well, exactly.
[01:04:07.504 --> 01:04:09.805]  There are dangerous chemicals in these vaccines.
[01:04:09.805 --> 01:04:19.993]  There are chemical adjuvants, which are designed to cause an inflammation response of the immune system, but it also causes inflammation of the nervous system.
[01:04:19.993 --> 01:04:23.295]  So it's linked to all kinds of nervous system problems.
[01:04:23.295 --> 01:04:27.638]  Now, here's the big untold story about vaccines is the miscarriages.
[01:04:28.539 --> 01:04:31.542]  Women who are getting vaccinated when they have a child.
[01:04:31.542 --> 01:04:33.123]  And that's in the Australian news.
[01:04:33.123 --> 01:04:33.483]  Stay there.
[01:04:33.483 --> 01:04:34.945]  I want you to recap that.
[01:04:34.945 --> 01:04:36.466]  Get into the miscarriages.
[01:04:36.466 --> 01:04:38.608]  The Australian government's been admitting it.
[01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:39.909]  They're trying to cover it up here.
[01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:45.174]  The British government admits a tenfold increase in seizures in children taking it and they suspended it.
[01:04:46.445 --> 01:04:51.849]  Then the government and the media and these pharmacies put out fact sheets.
[01:04:51.849 --> 01:04:54.411]  They print up saying, no danger.
[01:04:54.411 --> 01:04:57.914]  But then if you ask for the actual insert, it says this stuff can kill you.
[01:04:57.914 --> 01:04:59.154]  We'll be right back with Mike Adams.
[01:04:59.154 --> 01:04:59.555]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.799 --> 01:05:04.641]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:05:04.641 --> 01:05:08.903]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:05:08.903 --> 01:05:14.225]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:05:14.225 --> 01:05:19.567]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:05:19.567 --> 01:05:23.209]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:05:23.209 --> 01:05:26.611]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:05:29.327 --> 01:05:34.872]  I'm looking for America.
[01:05:34.872 --> 01:05:36.493]  We're American and be proud.
[01:05:36.493 --> 01:05:39.455]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:05:39.455 --> 01:05:43.619]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:05:43.619 --> 01:05:47.702]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:05:55.296 --> 01:06:00.523]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:05.089]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:09.415]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.415 --> 01:06:09.896]  Number two,
[01:06:10.276 --> 01:06:15.158]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.158 --> 01:06:15.899]  It's true.
[01:06:15.899 --> 01:06:20.781]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.781 --> 01:06:21.601]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.601 --> 01:06:25.183]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.183 --> 01:06:29.104]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.104 --> 01:06:29.885]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:32.666]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.666 --> 01:06:36.328]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.328 --> 01:06:36.568]  Number 5.
[01:06:37.108 --> 01:06:41.270]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:46.312]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.312 --> 01:06:50.493]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.493 --> 01:06:52.274]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:56.876]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:01.274 --> 01:07:16.744]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:16.744 --> 01:07:20.427]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:21.434 --> 01:07:34.204]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:34.204 --> 01:07:41.470]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:52.541]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:56.465]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:07:56.465 --> 01:07:59.569]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:08:05.731 --> 01:08:10.553]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:12.133]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.133 --> 01:08:13.674]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.674 --> 01:08:17.876]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.876 --> 01:08:24.058]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:27.459]  You know, we see the headlines, but they don't get the attention.
[01:08:27.459 --> 01:08:28.660]  London Guardian comes out.
[01:08:29.844 --> 01:08:35.490]  British government admits tenfold increase in seizures of children that took the H1N1 shot.
[01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:40.056]  They admit it's causing, with the adjuvants, an autoimmune response, brain swelling.
[01:08:40.056 --> 01:08:42.038]  Big studies linking it to pancreas failure.
[01:08:42.038 --> 01:08:44.921]  It's more than just the corn syrup making the pancreas go out.
[01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:47.344]  It's causing autoimmune problems.
[01:08:47.344 --> 01:08:51.148]  And in key organs, like the brain, the pancreas, the liver, it's bad news.
[01:08:52.249 --> 01:08:56.770]  But now it's actually being admitted in Australia, the massive miscarriages.
[01:08:56.770 --> 01:09:00.451]  If you go back just two years ago, they always said, don't give flu shots to women.
[01:09:00.451 --> 01:09:01.691]  Now they say, who are pregnant.
[01:09:01.691 --> 01:09:04.292]  Now it's, oh, more important if you're pregnant.
[01:09:04.292 --> 01:09:06.852]  They're just practicing murdering people out in the open.
[01:09:06.852 --> 01:09:12.613]  Mike Adams, the editor of Natural News, the health ranger, is going to be joining us to talk about that.
[01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:15.014]  But the main issue is this food safety bill.
[01:09:15.874 --> 01:09:19.597]  That's the opposite of a food safety bill, and it ties into the UN.
[01:09:19.597 --> 01:09:23.941]  We're going to get where that bill's at, what's happening with it, with Mike Adams.
[01:09:23.941 --> 01:09:37.271]  Then we've got a two-time Super Bowl winner, five-time Pro Bowler, I forget, Mark Stibnoski coming on with a big 9-11 truth announcement, along with an engineer who was on Geraldo Rivera and convinced Geraldo that 9-11 could be an inside job.
[01:09:38.286 --> 01:09:42.249]  Also, Judge Andrew Napolitano is now saying he doesn't buy the official story.
[01:09:42.249 --> 01:09:43.790]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:46.893]  But we'll go back to Mike Adams here in just a moment.
[01:09:46.893 --> 01:09:52.877]  Before I go any further here today, I want to thank efoodsdirect.com.
[01:09:52.877 --> 01:09:57.801]  High quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid food.
[01:09:57.801 --> 01:09:59.022]  It's made fresh every week.
[01:10:00.171 --> 01:10:03.454]  It's all from here in America, except for the bananas.
[01:10:03.454 --> 01:10:05.175]  Obviously, you can't really grow those here.
[01:10:05.175 --> 01:10:08.759]  And if you don't own a farm, you need to have storable food.
[01:10:08.759 --> 01:10:12.222]  But it's the old-fashioned farmers that have storable food on top of it.
[01:10:12.222 --> 01:10:13.743]  I mean, look in New York.
[01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:18.467]  Women begging for help in department stores for nine hours, having a baby on the floor.
[01:10:18.467 --> 01:10:19.928]  The police don't come because of the snow.
[01:10:20.789 --> 01:10:22.591]  I mean, government can't and won't help you.
[01:10:22.591 --> 01:10:24.353]  Going into this, you need to have storable food.
[01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:28.396]  The place to get it is efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:10:28.396 --> 01:10:28.757]  800-409-5633.
[01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:32.460]  This is where I got my food.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.883]  I bought it at other places and it was horrible.
[01:10:34.883 --> 01:10:36.184]  There might be other good people out there.
[01:10:36.184 --> 01:10:37.065]  I haven't found them.
[01:10:37.065 --> 01:10:38.106]  This is the place.
[01:10:38.106 --> 01:10:38.706]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:10:38.706 --> 01:10:38.766]  800-409-5633.
[01:10:38.766 --> 01:10:39.147]  And finally,
[01:10:43.971 --> 01:10:50.076]  By the way, the guy we got on with us gave him the 2009 Best Superfood Award, and he's not funded or sponsored by them.
[01:10:50.076 --> 01:10:50.737]  I am.
[01:10:50.737 --> 01:10:52.298]  They're patriots.
[01:10:52.298 --> 01:10:58.162]  They're friends with good old George Humphrey here in Austin, though they're out in Colorado.
[01:10:58.162 --> 01:11:00.685]  Wonderful people, InnerFood, a whole line of superfoods.
[01:11:01.465 --> 01:11:06.529]  E-N-E-R-F-O-O-D dot com, innerfood.com, 866-762-9238.
[01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:10.052]  Give them a call.
[01:11:10.052 --> 01:11:11.993]  They've got Alex Jones specials and combos.
[01:11:11.993 --> 01:11:16.677]  Just ask about it or look for it when you're on the site, or click on their banners on infowars.com.
[01:11:16.677 --> 01:11:20.139]  Again, innerfood.com or 866-762-9238.

[01:11:30.427 --> 01:11:33.988]  And lastly, don't forget that we run this every year.
[01:11:33.988 --> 01:11:35.648]  Now, this is our seventh year doing it.
[01:11:35.648 --> 01:11:43.230]  We run this every year, where you can get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv in the month of December, end of the new year.
[01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:48.591]  That special's about to end, and your $5.95 a month, if it's a monthly membership, funds our operation.
[01:11:48.591 --> 01:11:54.172]  Plus, you get the live video streaming of the radio show, not just the radio, the archives, a higher quality audio podcast.
[01:11:55.086 --> 01:12:00.731]  My book that's out of print, Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, The New World Order Out of Print.
[01:12:00.731 --> 01:12:06.477]  We're flying all over the country interviewing everybody, Mike Adams, you name it, in person, putting it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:06.477 --> 01:12:12.042]  Two or three new videos a week, and we've got just literally 50, 60, 70 more.
[01:12:12.042 --> 01:12:13.764]  I'm even going back to stuff I never put out.
[01:12:13.764 --> 01:12:14.805]  It's all going to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:16.306 --> 01:12:25.391]  An armory of resistance, any subject you want, download it, burn it to disk, give it to who you know, share your passcode with friends, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:12:25.391 --> 01:12:33.875]  And the, uh, we're gonna get five months free right now, that special's about to end, and we have the online video bookstore as well for hard copies of everything at InfoWars.com.
[01:12:33.875 --> 01:12:35.316]  Okay, I'm gonna try to shut up now.
[01:12:35.876 --> 01:12:39.499]  Just filling the gas tank there of our B-2 bomber attacking the New World Order.
[01:12:39.499 --> 01:12:40.820]  We need the funds.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:45.484]  Going back to Mike Adams, one of the leading alternative health experts out there.
[01:12:45.484 --> 01:12:46.805]  Very respected.
[01:12:46.805 --> 01:12:50.528]  Recapping what you're recovering with the 2010 flu hoax.
[01:12:50.528 --> 01:12:54.451]  Maybe we should briefly look at the 2009 and then that miscarriage information.
[01:12:54.451 --> 01:12:56.152]  We're trying to save some lives here.
[01:12:56.152 --> 01:13:01.917]  Then we'll shift gears into the UN angle of the food enslavement bill.
[01:13:01.917 --> 01:13:02.217]  Sure.
[01:13:02.217 --> 01:13:05.420]  Well, you've got to realize that the drug companies, the vaccine manufacturers,
[01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:11.657]  They have to fabricate an emergency every year in order to try to get people to take these shots.
[01:13:12.265 --> 01:13:15.346]  And so, this year, that has failed for the most part.
[01:13:15.346 --> 01:13:17.267]  People were not getting vaccinated.
[01:13:17.267 --> 01:13:18.948]  People learned their lesson from last year.
[01:13:18.948 --> 01:13:21.769]  You know, the big twine flu hoax, crash and burn.
[01:13:21.769 --> 01:13:33.754]  And also, people who didn't take the shot, who instead took vitamin D, and who took superfoods like your sponsor, Enterfood, and other good foods out there, and who took care of their health, they were fine.
[01:13:33.754 --> 01:13:35.054]  They didn't get sick.
[01:13:35.054 --> 01:13:39.036]  And they, a lot of them woke up, and they realized, gee, we don't need the vaccine.
[01:13:39.036 --> 01:13:40.677]  We're going to be healthier without it.
[01:13:40.677 --> 01:13:41.057]  So now,
[01:13:41.949 --> 01:13:45.211]  Because their propaganda is failing, they have to push it.
[01:13:45.211 --> 01:13:46.892]  And that's what they're doing now in the UK.
[01:13:46.892 --> 01:13:47.992]  They're pushing it.
[01:13:47.992 --> 01:13:53.976]  There are a couple hundred people in the hospitals who are suffering from swine flu, and they're saying everybody needs to get vaccinated.
[01:13:53.976 --> 01:14:06.543]  Now they're saying we've got to revisit the vaccinations for children under five years old, because they pulled those vaccines previously for children under five in the National Health Service because of the potential risk.
[01:14:06.543 --> 01:14:10.105]  But now they're saying, well, because of this pandemic breaking out,
[01:14:10.868 --> 01:14:12.589]  We've got to vaccinate all those kids.
[01:14:12.589 --> 01:14:20.033]  And in the U.S., as you hinted, they're now saying we've got to vaccinate pregnant women, too, so that their children can be, quote, protected.
[01:14:20.033 --> 01:14:30.898]  And by the way, I also saw an article recently saying that they're promoting chemotherapy for pregnant women, saying it's safe to have chemo even when you have a child inside you.
[01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:36.546]  This is medical insanity!
[01:14:36.546 --> 01:14:40.570]  They're setting the precedent to get away with mass murder, and they know what they're doing.
[01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:47.977]  They're turning health purely into a death camp, a eugenics camp, as Ted Turner and Bill Gates have admitted.
[01:14:47.977 --> 01:14:49.118]  They mean business.
[01:14:49.118 --> 01:14:53.782]  And for those that don't know, I remember just a few years ago, it always said in the inserts
[01:14:54.423 --> 01:15:07.792]  And I've had medical doctors on that have pointed this out, that you never give a pregnant woman a vaccine, because they know it causes autoimmune inflammation, not just in the brain, but in the fetus, and triggers massive increases in miscarriages.
[01:15:07.792 --> 01:15:14.757]  This time they said women who have babies in their uterus, you're the one that really needs this.
[01:15:14.757 --> 01:15:18.139]  I mean, what an outrageous thing they did, and I've seen it.
[01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:24.103]  The only country to be admitting it is Australia, where they're admitting this is causing the death of babies.
[01:15:24.783 --> 01:15:29.285]  Well, it's astonishing in all this if you look across the government bureaucracy.
[01:15:29.285 --> 01:15:37.950]  And, you know, you had Rand Paul on a couple of weeks ago talking about how these bureaucrats create laws themselves, especially by creating regulations.
[01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.491]  They're unelected, but they create regulations.
[01:15:41.044 --> 01:15:44.466]  Like the FDA and the TSA and the DEA and so on.
[01:15:44.466 --> 01:15:49.128]  These government bodies, they now, they just blatantly lie.
[01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:51.109]  They don't even care about telling the truth.
[01:15:51.109 --> 01:15:53.170]  They don't even care if they're caught in a lie.
[01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:56.972]  They just keep lying because most people keep buying it.
[01:15:56.972 --> 01:16:00.113]  So they throw out the evidence of harm for vaccines.
[01:16:00.113 --> 01:16:05.836]  You know, uh, the TSA tried to dismiss any of these complaints about, you know, people breaching down their pants and so on.
[01:16:05.836 --> 01:16:07.337]  They say, oh, it's for your own good.
[01:16:07.337 --> 01:16:09.678]  I mean, you've been all over that issue, so you know what I'm talking about.
[01:16:10.447 --> 01:16:16.590]  Every agency now is just running rampant across our freedoms and across the Constitution.
[01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:21.673]  And now, with the Food Safety Bill, which I know we're going to talk about here, our food is at risk.
[01:16:21.673 --> 01:16:23.154]  They want to control our food.
[01:16:23.154 --> 01:16:27.656]  They want to reach into our refrigerators the same way the GSA has been reaching down our pants.
[01:16:27.656 --> 01:16:28.717]  That's what's happened.
[01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:29.977]  That's what's coming our way now in 2011.
[01:16:32.498 --> 01:16:33.058]  Incredible.
[01:16:33.058 --> 01:16:36.859]  Let's get into the Homeland Security tie-in.
[01:16:36.859 --> 01:16:45.281]  It was admitted, even in the Wall Street Journal, a record $12 million given in the month of November to get the House to pass the draconian takeover.
[01:16:45.281 --> 01:16:51.523]  The $12 million was given completely by mega agribusiness to shut down their competitions.
[01:16:51.523 --> 01:16:53.423]  Let's go over it.
[01:16:53.423 --> 01:16:55.824]  Alright, well, let's set the frame here for your listeners.
[01:16:56.511 --> 01:17:00.792]  The bill proponents said that this is all about food safety.
[01:17:00.792 --> 01:17:04.352]  We're going to save 5,000 lives a year.
[01:17:04.352 --> 01:17:06.393]  You know, the FDA is a good agency.
[01:17:06.393 --> 01:17:09.413]  It's going to protect your food and protect your children and so on.
[01:17:09.413 --> 01:17:20.995]  Well, what they didn't tell you is, for example, did you know that E. coli, according to the CDC itself, only kills about 82 Americans a year through food transmission.
[01:17:20.995 --> 01:17:22.196]  82 people.
[01:17:22.196 --> 01:17:23.716]  More people are killed by lightning
[01:17:24.517 --> 01:17:26.799]  In America, that are killed by E. coli.
[01:17:26.799 --> 01:17:29.641]  And yet, they made this into a big scare story.
[01:17:29.641 --> 01:17:31.362]  And that's a CDC statistic, by the way.
[01:17:31.362 --> 01:17:33.903]  You can see it right on the government website.
[01:17:33.903 --> 01:17:39.727]  And then, they hid things in the bill, things that are just now starting to come out.
[01:17:39.727 --> 01:17:49.814]  I've been reading this bill, Alex, going through it with a fine-tooth comb, because you know how crazy these bills can get, where you have to reference this section and delete that phrase from that paragraph.
[01:17:49.814 --> 01:17:50.995]  They're really hard to read.
[01:17:51.963 --> 01:17:59.429]  But if you get to this and you actually read it, it turns out that this bill says that the FDA
[01:18:00.211 --> 01:18:08.674]  ...has to put forth, quote, recommendations on whether and how to harmonize requirements under Codex Alimentarius.
[01:18:08.674 --> 01:18:10.135]  It's right there.
[01:18:10.135 --> 01:18:13.936]  The open world government standardization.
[01:18:13.936 --> 01:18:18.878]  This is... Well, I mean, when you see the food safety bill, it's what's in Codex Alimentarius.
[01:18:18.878 --> 01:18:20.559]  It's global standardization.
[01:18:20.559 --> 01:18:22.739]  Now they're not even denying that.
[01:18:22.739 --> 01:18:29.202]  They're openly trying to bring us under this world government to shut down local farms and ranches because people
[01:18:29.882 --> 01:18:30.083]  Are you?
[01:18:49.344 --> 01:18:50.505]  Eating non-GMO.
[01:18:50.505 --> 01:18:52.386]  It's our duty to start gardens.
[01:18:52.386 --> 01:18:56.089]  It's our duty, even if they pass this, to literally rebel.
[01:18:56.089 --> 01:18:58.250]  And they're setting up the SWAT teams, everything.
[01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:07.257]  They're SWAT teaming the Amish to grow those tomatoes and then let them try to arrest you and further discredit these hordes of demons they've recruited.
[01:19:08.493 --> 01:19:09.253]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:09.253 --> 01:19:16.476]  The most patriotic thing that you could do, perhaps, right now, is to grow your own food and sell it at a local farmer's market.
[01:19:16.476 --> 01:19:17.816]  Sell it to your neighbors.
[01:19:17.816 --> 01:19:19.637]  Sell it to your community members.
[01:19:19.637 --> 01:19:23.198]  You know, grow some honest tomatoes and just sell them.
[01:19:23.198 --> 01:19:27.279]  And this is what the government precisely doesn't want you to do.
[01:19:27.279 --> 01:19:32.020]  And that's why they've created all of this dark, globalist language in this bill.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:32.961]  Let me give you some other examples.
[01:19:32.961 --> 01:19:33.361]  We'll stay there.
[01:19:33.361 --> 01:19:34.761]  We're going to come back and hit this.
[01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:36.562]  We've got to go to break, but think about it.
[01:19:37.808 --> 01:19:44.035]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the 1930s, Stalin couldn't crush the poor farmers.
[01:19:44.035 --> 01:19:48.860]  He wanted to collectivize them, like Mao later did and killed 60-plus million people.
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:55.247]  So he said, you can't grow your own gardens anymore, and starved 30-plus million people to death.
[01:19:55.247 --> 01:19:56.388]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[01:19:56.388 --> 01:19:57.609]  These are hardcore criminals.
[01:19:57.609 --> 01:19:58.150]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.283 --> 01:20:05.365]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.365 --> 01:20:09.867]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.867 --> 01:20:16.030]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:18.471]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.471 --> 01:20:24.414]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.554 --> 01:20:27.957]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.957 --> 01:20:29.838]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.838 --> 01:20:32.020]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:36.904]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:36.904 --> 01:20:37.705]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:37.705 --> 01:20:41.768]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:42.008 --> 01:20:50.030]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.770]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:51.611]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:21:01.972 --> 01:21:05.996]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:05.996 --> 01:21:09.240]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:14.025]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:14.025 --> 01:21:20.431]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.431 --> 01:21:22.674]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:21:23.194 --> 01:21:23.494]  Tim Geithner?
[01:21:23.494 --> 01:21:24.014]  Bernanke?
[01:21:24.014 --> 01:21:24.494]  They're arsonists!
[01:21:24.494 --> 01:21:25.355]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:25.355 --> 01:21:27.475]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.099 --> 01:21:49.382]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:23:00.151 --> 01:23:06.957]  One of the most potent ways to lower blood pressure is to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the body, also called ACE.
[01:23:06.957 --> 01:23:11.540]  In nature, there are a group of proteins found in unheated whey that inhibit the ACE enzyme.
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:14.743]  The most potent ACE inhibitor to date is Lactokinin.
[01:23:14.743 --> 01:23:25.172]  While Lactokinin does not have the inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in the treatment of hypertension, this naturally occurring whey peptide may be able to help keep blood pressure normal.
[01:23:25.672 --> 01:23:29.836]  The most powerful whey protein supplement on the market is One World Whey.
[01:23:29.836 --> 01:23:35.300]  One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:38.803]  One World Whey is easily digested and tastes delicious.
[01:23:38.803 --> 01:23:45.588]  Use One World Whey to support your exercise or weight loss goals, your optimal blood pressure, energy, endurance, and mood.
[01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:46.769]  To order, call 888-988-3325.

[01:24:16.255 --> 01:24:21.337]  All right, going back to Mike Adams, only got about five minutes left with him right now.
[01:24:21.337 --> 01:24:28.359]  Mike, continuing, I mean, you've got quoted in your article, it's up at naturalnews.com, it's up at InfoWars and Prison Planet, people want to read it.
[01:24:28.359 --> 01:24:34.782]  Food safety bill invokes Codex Harmonization and grants FDA authority to police food safety for foreign nations.
[01:24:34.782 --> 01:24:38.443]  I mean, this is the global government right here and they mention it's Codex Alimentarius.
[01:24:38.443 --> 01:24:40.624]  Tell folks what section 308 really means.
[01:24:41.766 --> 01:25:00.820]  Well, first of all, for those who are skeptical, and, you know, I encourage people to be critical thinkers and they want to see this for themselves, if you go to the Thomas government search engine, where you can search bills, and you put in HR 2751, because that's what this was passed under, and you bring up this PDF file, go to page 195.
[01:25:02.851 --> 01:25:04.772]  You'll see this language for yourself.
[01:25:04.772 --> 01:25:06.233]  And you'll also see Section 308.
[01:25:06.233 --> 01:25:10.256]  It's called the Foreign Offices of the Food and Drug Administration.
[01:25:10.256 --> 01:25:12.177]  Yes, we're not kidding.
[01:25:12.177 --> 01:25:18.501]  The FDA is going to set up enforcement offices in other nations, other countries.
[01:25:18.501 --> 01:25:27.166]  And they're going to dictate to these countries how they should run their food safety systems so that when they export food to the United States,
[01:25:27.811 --> 01:25:39.039]  It adheres to, quote, FDA standards, which, by the way, means that all your food should be dead, pasteurized, fumigated, or otherwise killed or nutritively destroyed.
[01:25:39.039 --> 01:25:44.062]  To the FDA, the only safe food is dead food.
[01:25:44.062 --> 01:25:47.885]  And they openly tell local farmers, get big or get out.
[01:25:47.885 --> 01:25:53.008]  We know they force the Iraqis to only take Monsanto GMO crops.
[01:25:53.008 --> 01:25:55.710]  I mean, this is a strategic military takeover.
[01:25:56.462 --> 01:26:03.245]  Well, yeah, and additional evidence came out in the WikiLeaks cables, which shows that Spain was involved with the U.S.
[01:26:03.245 --> 01:26:16.572]  ambassador to France and the GMO companies pushing GMOs into Europe, and they were creating a, quote, retaliatory target list of who to go after if they resisted GMOs.
[01:26:16.572 --> 01:26:18.133]  I mean, this is all in the cables.
[01:26:18.703 --> 01:26:27.169]  So we know there is a GMO global conspiracy, and it's not a theory, it's a real conspiracy that's happening right now.
[01:26:27.169 --> 01:26:37.135]  And now with this food safety bill, we know that the FDA is going to try to run the food safety programs of other nations and try to harmonize America with Codex.
[01:26:37.135 --> 01:26:38.716]  This is coming!
[01:26:38.716 --> 01:26:41.658]  You know, we've been talking about this for how many years, Alex?
[01:26:41.658 --> 01:26:43.640]  And it's coming now.
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.443]  It is now about to be signed by Obama and become law and be enforced.
[01:26:51.337 --> 01:26:51.937]  Absolutely.
[01:26:51.937 --> 01:26:53.678]  Continue, this is important what you're talking about.
[01:26:53.678 --> 01:26:58.040]  Alright, well, it also involves the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.061]  This language is right in the bill.
[01:27:00.061 --> 01:27:08.525]  It says that in developing this plan, the FDA is going to consult with these different departments, which they call stakeholders.
[01:27:08.525 --> 01:27:15.748]  The stakeholders in the food safety bill include the Department of Homeland Security and, get this, the U.S.
[01:27:15.748 --> 01:27:17.249]  Treasury.
[01:27:17.249 --> 01:27:20.030]  What is the Treasury doing in my kitchen?
[01:27:20.896 --> 01:27:25.199]  Why is the Treasury, why does it have its hands in the food supply issues?
[01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:29.042]  Well, you already know the answer, and I think your listeners probably do too.
[01:27:29.042 --> 01:27:42.350]  But the people voting on this bill, you know, the naive senators and members of the House who voted for this, they probably don't get it, or most of them don't, that this is all tied in with centralizing control.
[01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:50.316]  Control over security, control over the money supply, control over the food supply, and control over your health, or actually your sick care.
[01:27:50.936 --> 01:27:55.178]  So once they've got the control, then you don't have options.
[01:27:55.178 --> 01:27:59.580]  You don't have an option to go grow your own medicine in your backyard, because you can grow medicine.
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:03.281]  You know, natural herbal medicine and superfoods, you can grow them in your backyard.
[01:28:03.281 --> 01:28:16.487]  They don't want you to do that, because that way you are a slave to the medical system, where you have to go pay money for prescriptions, and you have to keep paying month after month, year after year, until you one day die bankrupt as another victim of big pharma.
[01:28:17.478 --> 01:28:40.340]  They have these systems of control, the grasp is getting worse, and thank goodness that there are still freedom fighters out there, like you Alex, like the health freedom organizations out there, who are trying to stand up, who are doing a good job actually, of standing up and bringing attention to this issue and helping us lead the fight to resist tyranny and restore the freedoms that we are supposed to be guaranteed under the United States Constitution.
[01:28:42.714 --> 01:28:46.637]  Mike, I couldn't say it any more focused or succinctly than that.
[01:28:46.637 --> 01:28:59.045]  And, you know, in closing, I just over the years see the mainstream media make fun of us about Codex Alimentarius, when all we're doing is covering what the private corporations of the UN and the World Trade Organization are announcing.
[01:28:59.045 --> 01:29:02.967]  And then now here it is in the bill, and there's no discussion of it.
[01:29:02.967 --> 01:29:04.228]  Thank God you found it in there.
[01:29:04.228 --> 01:29:05.129]  It's always changing.
[01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:09.147]  Like you say, they're hiding it in plain sight.
[01:29:09.147 --> 01:29:11.128]  You know, I hear you use that phrase quite a bit.
[01:29:11.128 --> 01:29:12.028]  You're exactly right.
[01:29:12.028 --> 01:29:13.249]  They hide it in plain sight.
[01:29:13.249 --> 01:29:14.389]  They put it right in there.
[01:29:14.389 --> 01:29:15.270]  It's a government record.
[01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:17.151]  That's a certified government document.
[01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:20.072]  If you open up that PDF, it's a certified government document.
[01:29:20.072 --> 01:29:21.593]  The language is right in there.
[01:29:21.593 --> 01:29:22.834]  Use the search function yourself.
[01:29:22.834 --> 01:29:23.534]  You can see it.
[01:29:23.534 --> 01:29:24.595]  You can read it.
[01:29:24.595 --> 01:29:27.336]  And you can bet the FDA is going to act on it.
[01:29:27.336 --> 01:29:28.857]  They're going to push this agenda.
[01:29:28.857 --> 01:29:30.878]  It's now about to become law.
[01:29:30.878 --> 01:29:31.859]  This is happening today.
[01:29:33.402 --> 01:29:33.962]  Amazing.
[01:29:33.962 --> 01:29:36.843]  Mike Adams from NaturalNews.com.
[01:29:36.843 --> 01:29:40.544]  He also authorizes us to post the wonderful material from that at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:40.544 --> 01:29:42.445]  We love the great work he's doing.
[01:29:42.445 --> 01:29:44.765]  Mike, I look forward to having you back in studio soon.
[01:29:44.765 --> 01:29:45.385]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:45.385 --> 01:29:46.266]  Always great to join you.
[01:29:46.266 --> 01:29:46.746]  Take care.
[01:29:46.746 --> 01:29:47.306]  Great having you on.
[01:29:47.306 --> 01:29:51.367]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.367 --> 01:29:52.767]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.767 --> 01:29:55.288]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.288 --> 01:29:57.969]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.956 --> 01:30:05.158]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:30:05.158 --> 01:30:11.562]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:30:11.562 --> 01:30:18.946]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:30:18.946 --> 01:30:23.829]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:30:28.772 --> 01:30:32.515]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:30:32.515 --> 01:30:34.796]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:30:34.796 --> 01:30:35.137]  Call us!
[01:30:48.266 --> 01:30:48.847]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:48.847 --> 01:30:55.372]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:08.843 --> 01:31:11.406]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:11.406 --> 01:31:16.790]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:19.833]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:22.135]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:22.135 --> 01:31:28.401]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:31:28.401 --> 01:31:31.564]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:31.764 --> 01:31:37.548]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:31:37.548 --> 01:31:39.189]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:40.490]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:43.152]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:43.152 --> 01:31:47.375]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:47.375 --> 01:31:52.018]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:31:52.018 --> 01:31:54.600]  That's End of America, the number three, dot com.

[01:32:04.281 --> 01:32:10.002]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:10.002 --> 01:32:14.764]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:32:14.764 --> 01:32:18.505]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[01:32:47.996 --> 01:32:50.397]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:33:14.673 --> 01:33:18.935]  Well, we had him on a few weeks ago, and he's back via popular demand.
[01:33:18.935 --> 01:33:26.359]  But unfortunately, we've only got a half hour with him, but I look forward to having him up for a full hour in the near future, perhaps to even take more of your phone calls.
[01:33:26.359 --> 01:33:28.360]  He's Porter Stansbury.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:35.303]  He's got a long bio, but he's made a lot of incredible predictions that Barron's has called and others have called a dire prophecy.
[01:33:35.303 --> 01:33:37.284]  Even the Wall Street Journal has written articles.
[01:33:37.284 --> 01:33:39.685]  We've got those linked up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:39.685 --> 01:33:42.767]  Amazed by how accurate his predictions are.
[01:33:43.607 --> 01:33:43.707]  And
[01:33:58.931 --> 01:34:05.874]  Folks understand what dollar devaluation and the de-pegging of the dollar, the world reserve currency, really means.
[01:34:05.874 --> 01:34:07.915]  I mean, people hear Glenn Beck talk about it.
[01:34:07.915 --> 01:34:09.216]  They hear people discuss it.
[01:34:09.216 --> 01:34:13.478]  They laughed at us a decade ago when they got rid of Glass-Steagall.
[01:34:13.478 --> 01:34:15.479]  And we warned people what was going to happen with Economist.
[01:34:15.959 --> 01:34:20.784]  I mean, this is really common sense, as Porter has said, but the media has tried to deny common sense.
[01:34:20.784 --> 01:34:24.928]  Now they're having to admit it, but they're still not telling people how serious this is going to be.
[01:34:24.928 --> 01:34:37.440]  Porter, from your deep research of this and the video, End of America, the number three dot com, that's one word, End of America, the number three dot com, to watch that free presentation that's so valuable and it's got a lot of solutions as well.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.302]  I mean, quantify what this means for people.
[01:34:40.933 --> 01:34:44.054]  Well, Alex, thanks for having me back on.
[01:34:44.054 --> 01:34:49.775]  One of the things I'm trying to do is just raise some awareness about the magnitude of this problem.
[01:34:49.775 --> 01:34:52.575]  Because I think people have heard this a couple times over the years.
[01:34:52.575 --> 01:34:59.536]  Remember back in the early 90s, the government shut down for a couple weeks and there were some issues about, oh, our debt's getting out of control.
[01:34:59.536 --> 01:35:01.037]  People were aware of the problem.
[01:35:01.037 --> 01:35:02.777]  But then it kind of goes on the back burner again.
[01:35:02.777 --> 01:35:07.158]  And now it's back on the forefront because the deficits are really soaring again.
[01:35:07.158 --> 01:35:08.218]  So now people are worried.
[01:35:08.898 --> 01:35:19.343]  But the problem is, from my point of view, Alex, is that the numbers have now gotten so large that there is no plausible way that we can ever repay the debt.
[01:35:19.343 --> 01:35:26.647]  And that leads our government to one solution, which is to print lots of new dollar bills to pay our obligations.
[01:35:26.647 --> 01:35:28.948]  The only way we can pay for them is by inflation.
[01:35:28.948 --> 01:35:30.709]  And just so you'll know the extent of the problem,
[01:35:31.429 --> 01:35:39.880]  If you look at the income tax and the corporate tax from the last year that was collected, that was the tax that the federal government got.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:46.689]  If you doubled that, if you increased the actual revenues by 100%, it still wouldn't have covered our deficit from last year.
[01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:52.673]  So, there is no way that we're going to be able to contain these deficits.
[01:35:52.673 --> 01:35:57.455]  And obviously, if you can't contain the deficits, you're never going to repay the principal.
[01:35:57.455 --> 01:36:13.583]  And the total liability today, right now, Alex, for all the government's debts, and for all of the things the government has promised to give people, like Medicare and Social Security, all of our future liabilities, the total bill per taxpayer is now over a million dollars.
[01:36:14.643 --> 01:36:21.628]  So how many of those taxpayers are actually going to ever be able to finance their million dollar obligation to the federal government?
[01:36:21.628 --> 01:36:24.410]  And how will any of that money ever actually get paid?
[01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:26.631]  And that's what I'm trying to warn people about.
[01:36:26.631 --> 01:36:30.193]  There is no way these debts can even be financed.
[01:36:30.193 --> 01:36:33.916]  And if you can't finance the debts, then you have to start printing money.
[01:36:33.916 --> 01:36:35.577]  And that's where we are right now today.
[01:36:38.735 --> 01:36:50.024]  And the cartel that controls our planet, these big financial institutions that have run us in the ground, the Madoff, Kinley types, I mean they can care less because they're going to be left with all the loot.
[01:36:50.024 --> 01:36:53.427]  We're going to be left with all the debt.
[01:36:53.427 --> 01:36:54.688]  I talked about quantifying it.
[01:36:55.649 --> 01:37:00.695]  You talk about it becoming clear that we've lost world reserve currency this year.
[01:37:00.695 --> 01:37:07.823]  A week after you were on, the Russians and Chinese officially started doing trade between each other in the Chinese currency.
[01:37:07.823 --> 01:37:10.166]  We see gold and silver rocketing back up.
[01:37:10.166 --> 01:37:11.868]  I mean, when do you see it?
[01:37:11.868 --> 01:37:14.631]  I mean, you've pointed out the dominoes have already fallen.
[01:37:15.732 --> 01:37:19.715]  It's kind of like a corpse that's cooling off right now, or starting to go into rigor mortis.
[01:37:19.715 --> 01:37:21.877]  But, I mean, how do you see those phases?
[01:37:21.877 --> 01:37:23.959]  How do you see it becoming more evident?
[01:37:23.959 --> 01:37:25.981]  I mean, what's it going to look like on the street?
[01:37:25.981 --> 01:37:29.784]  What does it mean to the average person to lose the dollar's World Reserve currency?
[01:37:29.784 --> 01:37:33.527]  I can't tell you how many people on the street have said, Alex, I see your show, I hear it.
[01:37:33.527 --> 01:37:37.110]  But, you know, I'm not in the stock market, or why should I care?
[01:37:37.110 --> 01:37:37.891]  Why should they care?
[01:37:38.496 --> 01:37:47.144]  Well, you know, Alex, a great example of how this affects people every day in their lives is look what's happened to the price of gasoline just in the last couple months.
[01:37:47.144 --> 01:37:51.848]  It's gone back above $3 a gallon, at least where I buy gas here on the East Coast.
[01:37:51.848 --> 01:37:53.749]  And I think that's probably true nationwide.
[01:37:53.749 --> 01:37:56.612]  On average, the gas is now above $3 a gallon again.
[01:37:57.192 --> 01:37:58.434]  How did that happen, Alex?
[01:37:58.434 --> 01:37:59.936]  Our economy hasn't grown.
[01:37:59.936 --> 01:38:02.619]  Demand for gasoline hasn't changed appreciably.
[01:38:02.619 --> 01:38:08.646]  And yet, the price of gas has gone from already from the low $2 range all the way back over to $3.
[01:38:08.646 --> 01:38:13.171]  Well, one of the top... I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Porter, but you're right.
[01:38:13.171 --> 01:38:16.595]  One of the top Shell execs said it's going to be $5 in the next year.
[01:38:17.256 --> 01:38:18.597]  It will be.
[01:38:18.597 --> 01:38:27.324]  What's funny, of course, is that the American people are going to rail against the oil companies, and they're going to blame them for higher gas prices.
[01:38:27.324 --> 01:38:31.488]  The oil companies have nothing to do with the global price of gasoline.
[01:38:31.488 --> 01:38:36.912]  That's set by the supply of oil, it's set by the value of the dollar, and it's set by the amount of refineries.
[01:38:36.912 --> 01:38:38.713]  They haven't built a refinery in the United States since 1975.
[01:38:43.117 --> 01:38:46.459]  A very large increase in the ability to convert oil to gas.
[01:38:46.459 --> 01:38:48.040]  That's one problem with the gas price.
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:52.222]  But by far the bigger problem is that the value of the dollar is collapsing.
[01:38:52.222 --> 01:38:54.823]  You see the price of gas go up by 50%.
[01:38:54.823 --> 01:38:57.505]  You see the price of gold double in two years.
[01:38:57.505 --> 01:38:59.826]  You see the price of silver triple in two years.
[01:39:00.266 --> 01:39:02.747]  When are people going to wake up and say, oh, you know what?
[01:39:02.747 --> 01:39:05.048]  There's some downside to all this quantitative easing.
[01:39:05.048 --> 01:39:12.211]  There's some downside to this creating trillions of dollars to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so that Americans can still have cheap mortgages.
[01:39:12.211 --> 01:39:17.434]  There are downsides to this government policy of runaway debts and money praying to pay for it.
[01:39:17.434 --> 01:39:22.296]  And the number one way it's going to affect people is in the grocery store and at the gas pump.
[01:39:22.296 --> 01:39:27.138]  And I promise you, you know, corn is at a new record price, and I'm sure the farmers think that's great.
[01:39:27.598 --> 01:39:28.740]  But you know what?
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:33.306]  There's going to be a big problem for a lot of people, especially the people who are in food stamps.
[01:39:33.306 --> 01:39:36.190]  Yeah, a lot of folks say, well I don't get ears of corn.
[01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:39.334]  Corn is a filler in almost every processed food.
[01:39:39.334 --> 01:39:39.875]  That's right.
[01:39:39.875 --> 01:39:41.036]  And think about this.
[01:39:41.036 --> 01:39:44.901]  There are 40 million Americans today, not in the future, today, on food stamps.
[01:39:45.602 --> 01:39:51.146]  What do you think they're going to do when the price of food doubles again next year and they can't afford to feed their families?
[01:39:51.146 --> 01:39:56.569]  You think they're just going to sit in their government-subsidized apartments calmly while they can't feed their children?
[01:39:56.569 --> 01:39:57.110]  No way!
[01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:58.351]  You know what's going to happen?
[01:39:58.351 --> 01:40:03.954]  There's going to be a huge problem with crime in the cities and with people rioting and demanding more money for food.
[01:40:03.954 --> 01:40:09.778]  By the way, Porter, I've got reports all over the country in major cities, doubling of rapes, doubling of robberies.
[01:40:09.778 --> 01:40:11.399]  I've got CNN articles today.
[01:40:11.399 --> 01:40:12.240]  It's already happening.
[01:40:13.223 --> 01:40:17.286]  Yeah, and you know, these things are really truly just the beginning.
[01:40:17.286 --> 01:40:22.830]  And people have still, they have no idea what has already been baked into the cake.
[01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:28.454]  I mean, you cannot, you cannot spend, if you're the federal government, next year you're planning to spend $4 trillion.
[01:40:28.454 --> 01:40:31.176]  $4 trillion you're planning to spend.
[01:40:31.176 --> 01:40:33.077]  You've only got taxes to cover about 25% of that.
[01:40:34.944 --> 01:40:39.906]  That's $3 trillion going to be added to our budget next year alone.
[01:40:39.906 --> 01:40:42.406]  Sooner or later, accreditors are going to go, forget it.
[01:40:42.406 --> 01:40:44.687]  We're not going to do this anymore.
[01:40:44.687 --> 01:40:48.828]  And then the only thing left to do is going to be totally to supply all that money by printing.
[01:40:48.828 --> 01:40:54.130]  Right now, the quantitative easing currently underway is $600 billion, which is a lot.
[01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:56.211]  That's why the prices of everything are going up.
[01:40:56.211 --> 01:41:03.793]  But when that $600 billion goes to $1 trillion of quantitative easing, or $2 trillion of quantitative easing, things are going to get out of control really quickly.
[01:41:05.819 --> 01:41:14.047]  Now, you also write extensively, and I'm reading over it, it's just excellent advice, about ways people can protect themselves.
[01:41:14.047 --> 01:41:20.093]  And I know you can't individually diagnose people, you can just give them general systems that have really, you know, worked in the past.
[01:41:20.093 --> 01:41:24.697]  You've got a wide range of, you know, deep newsletters and analysis and information.
[01:41:24.697 --> 01:41:28.281]  People can find out more by going to EndOfAmericaTheNumber3.com and
[01:41:29.682 --> 01:41:35.325]  Watching the free video or linking through on banners we have up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:41:35.325 --> 01:41:39.347]  But how do people protect themselves from this unraveling?
[01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:43.554]  Well, there's three things that you have to do.
[01:41:43.554 --> 01:41:46.978]  Number one, you have to own real money, which is gold and silver.
[01:41:46.978 --> 01:41:59.714]  You have to own real money because as the global monetary system collapses, because it's all based on the dollar, if that all falls apart, gold and silver are going to be the only things that really hold their value and will allow you to buy anything else you need.
[01:42:00.274 --> 01:42:01.535]  We're good to go.
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:26.904]  Shares of Monsanto, which is the big seed company that a lot of people don't like because they use genetic engineering in their seeds and some people are very afraid of that.
[01:42:26.904 --> 01:42:29.545]  I'm not commenting on whether or not that's a good or a bad idea.
[01:42:29.545 --> 01:42:34.186]  I'm commenting on the fact that farmers around the world buy that seed because it's very productive.
[01:42:34.186 --> 01:42:35.767]  Their share price has gone from $45 to almost $70.
[01:42:38.529 --> 01:42:38.749]  We're good.
[01:42:49.605 --> 01:42:57.807]  Well, all the financial experts and economists we've had on have been saying for two years that this inflation was going to accelerate right around 2010, 2011.
[01:42:57.807 --> 01:43:00.367]  And now I see the headlines.
[01:43:00.367 --> 01:43:05.728]  45% increase in rice, 50% in corn, 30% in this.
[01:43:05.728 --> 01:43:08.109]  I mean, it's going up across the board.
[01:43:08.109 --> 01:43:15.270]  And when I've studied hyperinflation throughout history, Porter, am I right in saying that the further you get along, the faster it moves?
[01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:24.213]  Exactly, because the only way to deal with, you know, these rising prices are now going to cause more credit problems.
[01:43:24.213 --> 01:43:26.234]  It's going to cause more deficit spending.
[01:43:26.234 --> 01:43:29.135]  It's kind of a cycle that builds on itself, Alex.
[01:43:29.135 --> 01:43:33.777]  And, you know, you can guarantee that the government is not going to say, no, we have to put a stop to this.
[01:43:33.777 --> 01:43:36.538]  We have to let companies go into default.
[01:43:36.838 --> 01:43:38.560]  We have to let banks fail.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:43.504]  We have to stop spending money we don't have in a democracy that's never going to happen.
[01:43:43.504 --> 01:43:50.411]  Because there is no political organization that stands for sound money and sound policies.
[01:43:50.411 --> 01:43:52.633]  You've got the Republicans who want to cut taxes.
[01:43:52.633 --> 01:43:54.475]  You've got the Democrats who want to spend.
[01:43:54.475 --> 01:43:58.258]  And if you look at the deal they just cut last month, you see what did they agree to do?
[01:43:58.258 --> 01:44:00.761]  They agreed to cut taxes and spend more.
[01:44:01.502 --> 01:44:06.472]  That's exactly the opposite of what we need to happen, and that's what's causing, that's the root of this problem.
[01:44:06.472 --> 01:44:11.242]  There is no political consensus in this country to have sound money and to have balanced budgets.
[01:44:13.683 --> 01:44:19.908]  Well still, if you talk to the average yuppie about having sound money, getting rid of the Federal Reserve, they laugh at you.
[01:44:19.908 --> 01:44:26.193]  It's a type of brainwashed, received knowledge to giggle at anyone that warns them.
[01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:30.416]  Again, even Glenn Beck gets attacked for warning people about this.
[01:44:30.416 --> 01:44:34.419]  And so, we're looking at some people that are really going to be helpless.
[01:44:34.419 --> 01:44:36.061]  What do you predict they're going to do?
[01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:37.302]  I'm worried about the government.
[01:44:38.168 --> 01:44:38.849]  We're good to go.
[01:44:48.679 --> 01:44:50.480]  I'm not saying that you're wrong about that, Alex.
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.220]  That might happen.
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.921]  But what I'm saying to you is that that will not solve the problem.
[01:44:53.921 --> 01:45:00.303]  If you doubled the tax revenues from last year, we still would have had a deficit.
[01:45:00.303 --> 01:45:04.025]  You cannot solve this fiscal problem by raising taxes.
[01:45:04.025 --> 01:45:05.385]  It cannot be done.
[01:45:05.385 --> 01:45:10.467]  The only way to solve this problem is by drastically reducing the government overhead.
[01:45:10.467 --> 01:45:17.550]  And we both know that'll never happen in this country because more than 50% of the people that vote don't pay taxes.
[01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:24.797]  So, there is no way this set of incentives, this structure we have right now in our government can survive.
[01:45:24.797 --> 01:45:29.943]  And the way that it will be destroyed is through a massive inflation that is underway right now.
[01:45:29.943 --> 01:45:35.649]  As far as the yuppies laughing about people saying we need to have sound money, we need to have money backed by gold and silver.
[01:45:35.649 --> 01:45:38.833]  Let me tell you what, it's the greatest lie that has ever been told.
[01:45:39.253 --> 01:45:47.435]  We convinced American people over the last 50 years that a piece of paper was more valuable and better than gold and silver.
[01:45:47.435 --> 01:45:49.616]  That is incredible.
[01:45:49.616 --> 01:45:56.058]  It's never happened before in history that the World Reserve currency was backed purely by nothing.
[01:45:56.058 --> 01:46:04.280]  And people are going to learn an enormously painful lesson, that you can't have money that's backed by nothing, because pretty soon all you're going to have is nothing.
[01:46:06.311 --> 01:46:09.692]  Well, I wish you were wrong, but history is replete with examples.
[01:46:09.692 --> 01:46:11.973]  Every economic indicator shows you're 100% right.
[01:46:11.973 --> 01:46:14.573]  And Porter, I have to agree with you.
[01:46:14.573 --> 01:46:23.056]  Not because, you know, your information is like some type of, you know, crystal ball prediction.
[01:46:23.056 --> 01:46:23.936]  It's as you've said.
[01:46:23.936 --> 01:46:25.377]  This is the facts.
[01:46:25.377 --> 01:46:26.377]  This is the reality.
[01:46:28.018 --> 01:46:30.519]  Yeah, I wish I was wrong, too.
[01:46:30.519 --> 01:46:41.585]  In fact, if your listeners want to look at the video I've made about all these issues to get to the details of it, you're going to see me saying repeatedly, look, this is the fact.
[01:46:41.585 --> 01:46:43.126]  I didn't make this number up.
[01:46:43.126 --> 01:46:45.147]  The U.S.
[01:46:45.147 --> 01:46:52.851]  federal spending really is $4 trillion, and total income tax and corporate tax revenue really is only $1 trillion.
[01:46:52.851 --> 01:46:56.353]  So all these numbers are there for people to consider.
[01:46:57.208 --> 01:47:14.833]  But the problem, as I see it, is that people don't realize that we have finally reached the point where you can't just kick the can down the road because the rate of increase of the size of these debts and the financing costs have become sort of parabolic.
[01:47:14.833 --> 01:47:19.894]  I mean, the total national government debt, the federal debt, has doubled since 2000.
[01:47:19.894 --> 01:47:22.895]  And as you know, Porter, that's only what's due right now.
[01:47:22.895 --> 01:47:23.915]  That's only what's due right now.
[01:47:23.915 --> 01:47:25.016]  Not obligations.
[01:47:26.176 --> 01:47:44.069]  For those that don't know, the website to see the free video is EndOfAmericaTheNumberThree.com and Porter Stansbury predicted the collapse of GM Fannie Mae years before it happened, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner General Growth Properties a few years ago.
[01:47:44.069 --> 01:47:47.291]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy and
[01:47:48.192 --> 01:47:54.614]  Again, even the Wall Street Journal, many other publications, Kitco, say this guy's got some of the most accurate predictions out there.
[01:47:54.614 --> 01:48:01.897]  But as Porter has said, this isn't one of his big, you know, complex predictions based on, you know, a whole bunch of data.
[01:48:01.897 --> 01:48:09.459]  This information is all right out there in the open for everyone who wants to know the truth.
[01:48:09.459 --> 01:48:11.280]  And I happen to agree with him.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:16.522]  There is not the political will or the education or the lobby out there.
[01:48:17.222 --> 01:48:20.584]  That wants to stand for saving our economy.
[01:48:20.584 --> 01:48:40.933]  These are cutthroat offshore corporations that are all greedy to consolidate their bottom line and out of crises, because they know what's coming, they're pre-positioned, they're going into all the raw materials for at least five years, into the farming stocks, into all these areas that we've been telling you to get into.
[01:48:41.753 --> 01:48:51.439]  And Porter, what's going to happen as things really start to unravel faster and finally the dumbed down masses figure out where the good investments are?
[01:48:51.439 --> 01:48:54.320]  Will those not create super bubbles?
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:49:08.068]  I tell you what Alex, my real fear, and I understand it sounds alarmist and I wish it didn't, but my real big fear actually relates to oil and gas prices and the federal food stamps programs.
[01:49:09.710 --> 01:49:14.055]  You know, I don't think it's going to be very long at all before gas is over $5 a gallon.
[01:49:14.055 --> 01:49:22.506]  And when people can't afford to drive to work anymore, and when people can't afford to buy groceries anymore with food stamps, you're not going to just have a financial problem.
[01:49:22.506 --> 01:49:24.990]  You're going to have a really big societal problem.
[01:49:25.590 --> 01:49:27.952]  And, you know, it's already happening in places like Atlanta.
[01:49:27.952 --> 01:49:32.956]  I don't know if you know this or not, but, you know, MARTA is the big public transport system in Atlanta.
[01:49:32.956 --> 01:49:40.101]  And because of the fiscal crisis, they've had to cut the number of routes and the availability of the public transportation.
[01:49:40.101 --> 01:49:42.983]  And that's resulted in a lot of people not being able to get to work.
[01:49:44.464 --> 01:49:44.824]  I think so.
[01:50:01.072 --> 01:50:04.155]  And by the way, it's 43 million people now on food stamps.
[01:50:04.155 --> 01:50:04.855]  I mean, it's growing.
[01:50:19.102 --> 01:50:31.474]  You know, this whole big lie, Alex, that we could all live at the expense of our neighbors, that somebody should pay for our mortgages, somebody else should pay for our food, somebody else should pay for our gas, all this stuff.
[01:50:31.474 --> 01:50:39.302]  I mean, it's just a giant lie, and it's all falling apart right now on the cold reality that we cannot finance our debts anymore.
[01:50:39.302 --> 01:50:41.063]  All right, I want to talk about, generally,
[01:50:41.804 --> 01:50:42.365]  We're good to go.
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:02.621]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.621 --> 01:51:08.225]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.225 --> 01:51:13.228]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.228 --> 01:51:18.272]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.812 --> 01:51:24.036]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.036 --> 01:51:26.337]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:26.337 --> 01:51:31.140]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:32.261]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.261 --> 01:51:35.043]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.043 --> 01:51:38.966]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.966 --> 01:51:42.148]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:42.148 --> 01:51:44.369]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:51:53.156 --> 01:51:58.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.382]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:52:39.889 --> 01:52:40.690]  This capitalism?
[01:52:40.690 --> 01:52:46.954]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:52:46.954 --> 01:52:47.815]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:52:47.815 --> 01:52:51.077]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[01:53:59.438 --> 01:54:11.348]  Folks, we're back live.
[01:54:11.348 --> 01:54:12.689]  We've got two-time
[01:54:14.673 --> 01:54:25.200]  Super Bowl champ from the Dallas Cowboys, Mark Stepnoski, joining us with a big announcement coming up in the next hour, along with an engineer to talk about some 9-11 issues.
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:32.565]  But I'm going to hold our guest five minutes into the next hour with us because it's impossible to have Porter Stansbury on for just 30 minutes.
[01:54:32.565 --> 01:54:34.366]  There's so much I can talk about with this guy.
[01:54:34.366 --> 01:54:36.748]  I had him on for an hour and a half a few weeks ago.
[01:54:36.748 --> 01:54:40.370]  But Porter, I was asking you during the break, what do you want to cover?
[01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:41.151]  Solutions?
[01:54:41.151 --> 01:54:44.113]  But I know those are so technical, folks should go check out the video.
[01:54:45.113 --> 01:54:46.874]  Uh, that's free at endofamerica3.com.
[01:54:46.874 --> 01:54:52.016]  Uh, or do you want to get into some of the things you see that are going to unravel?
[01:54:52.016 --> 01:54:54.437]  And you said, how about a little bit of both?
[01:54:54.437 --> 01:54:57.839]  Uh, let's get into the municipal, uh, situation.
[01:54:57.839 --> 01:55:01.020]  Those are already going bankrupt all over and it's only accelerating.
[01:55:01.957 --> 01:55:07.158]  Yeah, I don't think really people understand the scope of the municipal debt problem.
[01:55:07.158 --> 01:55:22.282]  I was talking with a guy whose name I can't share with you, it was a confidential interview, but I can tell you that he was the head of the Muni desk at Citigroup for the past 20 years, and he personally brokered $20-30 billion worth of high-yield municipal debt.
[01:55:22.922 --> 01:55:26.903]  I mean, if you want to talk to a guy who knows where all the bodies are buried, this is the guy.
[01:55:26.903 --> 01:55:32.345]  And what he told me was not surprising, really, but it clarified what the problem is going to be.
[01:55:32.345 --> 01:55:40.968]  The problem won't necessarily be with what they call the general obligation bonds of the states and the cities, because those bonds are going to be pretty well protected by tax revenues.
[01:55:41.508 --> 01:55:47.490]  But even though those are pretty safe, that's not even most of the debt that's out there.
[01:55:47.490 --> 01:56:03.635]  Most of the debt that's out there are these project bonds, where if a government wanted to build like a shopping center or a parking garage or a football stadium, something like that, they would issue these bonds that were not backed by the state.
[01:56:03.635 --> 01:56:06.076]  They were only backed by the revenue of that project.
[01:56:06.576 --> 01:56:08.397]  And all these bonds are defaulting.
[01:56:08.397 --> 01:56:12.298]  And it's kind of like the equivalent of subprime debt in housing.
[01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:16.380]  These project bonds that state and various municipalities issued.
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:17.821]  And they're going to be a huge problem.
[01:56:17.821 --> 01:56:18.481]  And here's what's funny.
[01:56:18.481 --> 01:56:19.641]  You'll get a kick out of this.
[01:56:19.641 --> 01:56:22.883]  A lot of these bonds have the same structure as actual subprime debt.
[01:56:22.883 --> 01:56:25.724]  Meaning that they have a variable interest rate component to them.
[01:56:25.724 --> 01:56:28.545]  So that as interest rates go up, all these bonds are going to default.
[01:56:29.305 --> 01:56:31.708]  And this is going to cause an enormous problem.
[01:56:31.708 --> 01:56:34.051]  That's a $3 trillion market.
[01:56:34.051 --> 01:56:36.454]  And so, you know, no one really knows what the solution is.
[01:56:36.454 --> 01:56:45.105]  But I can tell you this, if you are an investor in muni bonds, you have to know whether or not you have these project bonds in your portfolio.
[01:56:45.105 --> 01:56:47.328]  And there's really no good way to find out.
[01:56:47.748 --> 01:56:53.691]  And what does it mean for people that are retired firefighters, police, teachers, city workers?
[01:56:53.691 --> 01:56:59.014]  I mean this is gonna, it sounds like we haven't seen one one one hundredth of the crisis.
[01:56:59.625 --> 01:57:00.326]  No, we haven't.
[01:57:00.326 --> 01:57:01.767]  I'll give you a great example.
[01:57:01.767 --> 01:57:07.032]  You probably know that they built a huge new football stadium up in New Jersey in the Meadowlands Complex area.
[01:57:07.032 --> 01:57:07.672]  Yes!
[01:57:07.672 --> 01:57:07.913]  Okay?
[01:57:07.913 --> 01:57:09.574]  They just built a huge new stadium.
[01:57:09.574 --> 01:57:10.475]  Did you know this?
[01:57:10.475 --> 01:57:13.558]  They never paid for the old stadium.
[01:57:13.558 --> 01:57:17.301]  All of the debt that was outstanding to build the old stadium is still in place.
[01:57:17.301 --> 01:57:25.229]  Not a single penny of the principal was ever repaid, and the taxpayers of the state of New Jersey are still paying interest on the old stadium debt.
[01:57:25.894 --> 01:57:29.455]  So they built a new stadium without even finished paying for the old stadium.
[01:57:29.455 --> 01:57:37.597]  And this is a quintessential example of how municipal finance has gone on all across the country.
[01:57:37.597 --> 01:57:45.619]  And that's just one of tens of thousands of counties and cities and towns and all the debts they've racked up.
[01:57:45.619 --> 01:57:47.200]  I mean, we're in trouble.
[01:57:49.452 --> 01:57:52.496]  Next year, this is going to be the biggest financial story.
[01:57:52.496 --> 01:57:55.479]  And of course, it's just a prelude to what's going to happen.
[01:57:55.479 --> 01:57:58.182]  Because, Alex, you can know what's going to happen, right?
[01:57:58.182 --> 01:58:01.026]  The states are going to come in and guarantee all this project debt.
[01:58:01.026 --> 01:58:05.631]  Because if they don't, they're going to get completely excluded from the credit markets forever, and the state will go bankrupt.
[01:58:06.131 --> 01:58:08.192]  Sooner or later though, a state will go bankrupt.
[01:58:08.192 --> 01:58:09.333]  My bet is Illinois.
[01:58:09.333 --> 01:58:13.195]  And they're going to lose their credit rating, then the cost is going to go up.
[01:58:13.195 --> 01:58:15.336]  It's going to be a domino.
[01:58:15.336 --> 01:58:17.697]  And guess who's going to have to come in and save the states?
[01:58:17.697 --> 01:58:24.140]  Federal government, then they're going to lose the credit rating, then the cost of debt goes up even more, compounding it.
[01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:32.224]  Yeah, so guys like you and me are going to end up having to pay for all the idiocy of Chicago, and all the idiocy of New Jersey, and all the idiocy of California.
[01:58:32.224 --> 01:58:33.604]  Are we going to stand for it?
[01:58:35.782 --> 01:58:38.323]  We better not stay there, Porter.
[01:58:38.323 --> 01:58:40.344]  Man, I wish we had 10 hours with this guy.
[01:58:40.344 --> 01:58:41.465]  Unbelievable.
[01:58:41.465 --> 01:58:46.827]  On air, online, and on demand.
[01:58:46.827 --> 01:58:50.109]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:52.358 --> 01:58:56.379]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:56.379 --> 01:58:59.620]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:04.421]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:10.783]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.783 --> 01:59:13.044]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.584 --> 01:59:13.884]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.884 --> 01:59:14.405]  Bernanke?
[01:59:14.405 --> 01:59:15.185]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:15.185 --> 01:59:16.346]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:16.346 --> 01:59:18.587]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.475 --> 01:59:34.616]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.616 --> 01:59:39.760]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:54.089]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:54.089 --> 01:59:56.471]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.471 --> 01:59:59.253]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.819 --> 02:00:10.642]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.642 --> 02:00:12.224]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.224 --> 02:00:13.765]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.765 --> 02:00:17.968]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.968 --> 02:00:25.353]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.353 --> 02:00:33.458]  If you just joined us, we're talking to Porter Stansberry, an amazing financial analyst, and he's stating the facts.
[02:00:33.458 --> 02:00:35.260]  The states, the counties are already bankrupt.
[02:00:36.701 --> 02:00:41.806]  We haven't even seen but a very small portion of the iceberg.
[02:00:41.806 --> 02:00:44.428]  The federal government's bankrupt.
[02:00:44.428 --> 02:00:47.791]  It's already losing its AAA rating with the Chinese and others.
[02:00:47.791 --> 02:00:51.795]  When that becomes official, we'll be like Greece or Ireland.
[02:00:51.795 --> 02:00:53.836]  Then tomorrow we'll go up even more.
[02:00:54.801 --> 02:01:06.684]  And we will become like Argentina or Nigeria, and notice that Will Ferrell's new movie at the end of it, it's about corrupt bankers, says the answer is, tax the top 2%.
[02:01:06.684 --> 02:01:11.125]  They don't tell you that the top 2% are people making over $200,000 a year, most of them.
[02:01:11.125 --> 02:01:14.546]  Those are the people that actually still buy stuff, that still have employees.
[02:01:14.546 --> 02:01:18.447]  It's the mega-rich that are actually pushing all this against the middle class.
[02:01:18.447 --> 02:01:20.888]  Porter, you were talking about, will we stand for this?
[02:01:20.888 --> 02:01:21.728]  What's your take on it?
[02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:26.051]  You know, I don't have that answer.
[02:01:26.051 --> 02:01:30.832]  It's not just a financial problem, but the solution has to be political.
[02:01:30.832 --> 02:01:38.535]  And I don't know how you solve these problems when, again, more than half the people out there don't pay any federal taxes.
[02:01:38.535 --> 02:01:42.336]  So it's to their incentive to vote for more spending.
[02:01:42.336 --> 02:01:50.239]  And I don't know how you win a political contest, a popularity contest, by promising people they're going to get a lot less from the government.
[02:01:50.379 --> 02:01:58.206]  Well, in a republic this would be illegal, but in a democracy, two wolves and a sheep, the two wolves are going to vote to eat Porter Stansberry.
[02:01:58.206 --> 02:01:59.528]  That's right, that's right.
[02:01:59.528 --> 02:02:05.533]  I suggested in my newsletter recently that people should get as many votes as they have paid dollars in taxes.
[02:02:05.533 --> 02:02:09.397]  And that would change the incentives of the structure pretty tremendously.
[02:02:09.397 --> 02:02:16.063]  Of course, that will never happen, but it gives you a sense of how warped the incentives right now are in our democracy.
[02:02:16.704 --> 02:02:27.288]  Well, that's why we're in trouble, because the big money, the Hollywood people, are getting ready to burn the middle class, when it's the big mega elite that have actually gotten all the power out of this.
[02:02:27.288 --> 02:02:29.029]  It's just so frightening.
[02:02:29.029 --> 02:02:34.691]  I guess the only answer is, all we can do is try to inform people, but also protect ourselves.
[02:02:34.691 --> 02:02:37.513]  And you've got a huge team of experts and analysts.
[02:02:37.513 --> 02:02:44.515]  It's all covered in the free video, End of America, thenumber3.com, just, you know, the number three, End of America, thenumber3.com.
[02:02:46.457 --> 02:02:49.221]  And Porter, I should have asked you this earlier because we're almost out of time.
[02:02:49.221 --> 02:02:59.337]  Is there a number for people that aren't online if they want to call and find out about all the amazing research and different newsletters and information that Stansbury Research has available?
[02:02:59.975 --> 02:03:04.537]  Alex, I'm sorry, but no, you know, we really sell our stuff online.
[02:03:04.537 --> 02:03:06.738]  I don't have that number.
[02:03:06.738 --> 02:03:07.319]  I understand.
[02:03:07.319 --> 02:03:12.361]  Folks should get to the library then, or they should get to their neighbors, because this is invaluable info.
[02:03:12.361 --> 02:03:13.742]  Again, EndofAmerica3.com.
[02:03:13.742 --> 02:03:16.943]  End of America as we know it.
[02:03:16.943 --> 02:03:20.565]  Porter, in a minute and a half, what are some basic solutions for the average person?
[02:03:21.104 --> 02:03:23.565]  The most important thing to do, Alex, is real simple.
[02:03:23.565 --> 02:03:25.646]  You have to own some real money.
[02:03:25.646 --> 02:03:28.168]  And that means gold bullion and silver bullion.
[02:03:28.168 --> 02:03:29.769]  And, you know, you don't have to get fancy.
[02:03:29.769 --> 02:03:31.570]  You don't have to buy the rare coins.
[02:03:31.570 --> 02:03:34.751]  Just go buy some regular gold and silver bullion.
[02:03:34.751 --> 02:03:36.252]  Put it someplace safe.
[02:03:36.252 --> 02:03:44.717]  And then if you have a lot of assets, you want to do some investing, I highly recommend becoming a little bit of an expert in agriculture and energy.
[02:03:45.237 --> 02:03:53.180]  So that means a lot of the new gas resources, a lot of the new kind of oil companies that are beginning to produce onshore in the United States.
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:04:00.423]  And that means, of course, you know, large seed companies and other kinds of ag businesses that are well run and managed.
[02:04:00.423 --> 02:04:04.945]  And, you know, those are the focuses right now of the newsletter that I write for Stansberry Research.
[02:04:04.945 --> 02:04:08.546]  Well, I was reading stuff you wrote four years ago saying, get into agra.
[02:04:08.546 --> 02:04:09.867]  And that's been a great investment.
[02:04:09.867 --> 02:04:12.888]  One of the only things that's been good other than gold and silver.
[02:04:13.769 --> 02:04:20.814]  Yeah, it's been our focus for some time, because we've been afraid of the risk of this kind of inflation.
[02:04:20.814 --> 02:04:28.700]  And we've been following the numbers for a long time, as you know, that's what led us to avoid the disasters and the banks and with General Motors and stuff like that.
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:33.464]  But all this debt that was causing all those corporate problems has been shifted onto the U.S.
[02:04:33.464 --> 02:04:36.466]  Treasury, and it has never been repaid, and it's not going away.
[02:04:37.076 --> 02:04:39.919]  Porter Stansbury, I want to get you up for a full hour very soon.
[02:04:39.919 --> 02:04:42.982]  We really appreciate you coming on on short notice today.
[02:04:42.982 --> 02:04:49.168]  The website to see the free video is End of America, the number three, endofamericanumber3.com.
[02:04:49.168 --> 02:04:50.389]  Porter, have a great new year.
[02:04:50.389 --> 02:04:51.951]  We know it's going to be a crazy one next year.
[02:04:51.951 --> 02:04:52.792]  God bless you.
[02:04:52.792 --> 02:04:53.612]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[02:04:53.612 --> 02:04:54.794]  Thank you so much, Porter.
[02:04:54.794 --> 02:04:55.795]  That was Porter Stansbury.
[02:04:55.795 --> 02:04:56.615]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:56.615 --> 02:04:58.177]  Mark Stavnoski.
[02:04:58.177 --> 02:04:58.637]  Straight ahead.
[02:04:58.637 --> 02:04:58.998]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.237 --> 02:05:02.879]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.879 --> 02:05:06.242]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[02:05:21.417 --> 02:05:22.538]  Take my word for it.
[02:05:22.538 --> 02:05:25.201]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:05:25.201 --> 02:05:31.727]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:05:31.727 --> 02:05:33.229]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:05:53.292 --> 02:05:53.792]  Thank you!
[02:06:00.762 --> 02:06:05.325]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.325 --> 02:06:06.226]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.226 --> 02:06:09.648]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.648 --> 02:06:10.509]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.509 --> 02:06:15.412]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.412 --> 02:06:16.152]  It's true.
[02:06:16.152 --> 02:06:21.016]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.016 --> 02:06:21.856]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.856 --> 02:06:25.438]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.438 --> 02:06:29.141]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.341 --> 02:06:30.142]  Number 4.
[02:06:30.142 --> 02:06:32.905]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.905 --> 02:06:36.589]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:37.369]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.369 --> 02:06:41.514]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.514 --> 02:06:46.279]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.559 --> 02:06:50.726]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.726 --> 02:06:52.529]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:52.529 --> 02:06:54.792]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:06:54.792 --> 02:06:57.116]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:00.612 --> 02:07:04.453]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[02:07:04.453 --> 02:07:08.734]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:07:08.734 --> 02:07:13.376]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:07:13.376 --> 02:07:19.378]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:07:19.378 --> 02:07:23.019]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:07:23.019 --> 02:07:26.500]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:07:29.153 --> 02:07:34.680]  I'm looking for America.
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.322]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:07:36.322 --> 02:07:38.925]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:07:38.925 --> 02:07:43.550]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:47.274]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:07:55.106 --> 02:08:02.731]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:08:02.731 --> 02:08:09.356]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.356 --> 02:08:12.358]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:29.795 --> 02:08:42.625]  Well, Tony Zambotti, a mechanical engineer and part of Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth, now with over 1,200 members worldwide, is our guest, along with somebody else who really doesn't need any introduction.
[02:08:42.625 --> 02:08:45.027]  He's been a guest on this broadcast before.
[02:08:45.027 --> 02:08:58.417]  He's a great lover of liberty, former American football offensive lineman in the National Football League, Mark Stepnoski, career in the NFL, spent with the Dallas Cowboys, where he won, what, two Super Bowls, and, of course, five-time Pro Bowler.
[02:08:58.917 --> 02:09:00.399]  Doesn't get any better than that.
[02:09:00.399 --> 02:09:02.081]  And it's great having Mark with us.
[02:09:02.081 --> 02:09:08.970]  But I tell you, not only did I grow up in Dallas and a fan of the Dallas Cowboys growing up, I have to admit now that all I do is fight the Globalist.
[02:09:08.970 --> 02:09:10.933]  I can't even really enjoy a football game anymore.
[02:09:10.933 --> 02:09:12.915]  All I think about is this stuff.
[02:09:12.915 --> 02:09:14.137]  But I'm even a bigger fan of Mark.
[02:09:15.038 --> 02:09:24.507]  Not just for his determination on the football field, but how that same spirit translates into standing up many years ago when it wasn't as popular to talk about 9-11 truth.
[02:09:24.507 --> 02:09:26.589]  But he saw the evidence, he did it.
[02:09:26.589 --> 02:09:32.015]  And the same thing goes for our engineer friend, Mr. Zam Bode.
[02:09:32.015 --> 02:09:35.038]  Now, they're going to make a big announcement here today.
[02:09:35.038 --> 02:09:38.241]  Mark Stepnowski stepping up to the plate yet again.
[02:09:38.241 --> 02:09:39.001]  I'm honored that...
[02:09:39.662 --> 02:10:01.237]  Five six months ago they launched the building what campaign here on this show and my listeners Donated the lion's share of the original money to put the building what campaign dealing with building seven that nobody knows about on New York TV Since then it's been covered by hundreds of newspapers dozens and dozens of international TV networks Geraldo Rivera has now
[02:10:02.137 --> 02:10:19.661]  Had Mr. Zambotti and also one of the fathers of someone who died on his show and said that now he sees the 9-11 truth, Bob McElvenny, that now this should be investigated and that he's suspicious of Building 7.
[02:10:19.661 --> 02:10:30.323]  But even more, and this was covered by CNN even, this was covered by George Soros' people attacking this show and attacking him and calling for his firing, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[02:10:30.763 --> 02:10:48.195]  The co-host of Glenn Beck on his TV show, the guy with his own show on Fox Business with Lou Dobbs, came on this show without my prompting a month ago and said the official story of 9-11 is impossible and that it should be seen as the JFK assassination as a fraud.
[02:10:48.195 --> 02:10:54.639]  And the system has come after him and you notice he hadn't been fired because this is becoming the mainstream view.
[02:10:54.639 --> 02:11:00.263]  We have major polls like the New York Times, Angus and Reed, where 83% don't believe the official story.
[02:11:00.883 --> 02:11:14.353]  Kennedy assassination polls are upwards of 90% believe the official story is a lie and it's because of people's courage like Andres Fambulo, the former head of German defense coming out and saying it was an inside job.
[02:11:14.353 --> 02:11:16.495]  The former Italian president coming out.
[02:11:16.495 --> 02:11:21.118]  The number three in the Japanese government coming out on this show saying inside job.
[02:11:21.118 --> 02:11:28.284]  Because of so many family members and prominent people and emergency first responders and police officers that survived
[02:11:28.744 --> 02:11:30.185]  The evidence is coming out.
[02:11:30.185 --> 02:11:34.126]  Six of the 10 9-11 Commission are saying it's all a line of fraud.
[02:11:34.126 --> 02:11:39.288]  Mr. Farmer, the head lawyer, saying it's a quote criminal cover-up by the Pentagon.
[02:11:39.288 --> 02:11:42.649]  Ventura coming out, his show.
[02:11:42.649 --> 02:11:46.771]  I mean, and believe me, they've gone through a lot of harassment and intimidation over that.
[02:11:46.771 --> 02:11:48.591]  Homeland Security is trying to shut the show down.
[02:11:48.591 --> 02:11:53.653]  You heard Ventura two weeks ago break the news here that they have banned the Police State episode.
[02:11:53.653 --> 02:11:55.314]  I mean, this is a big issue.
[02:11:55.834 --> 02:11:57.876]  And it's about honor, it's about courage.
[02:11:57.876 --> 02:12:06.541]  And so, Mark Stepnoski, do you want to make the announcement here on the show today of what you've announced you're going to do this week?
[02:12:06.541 --> 02:12:07.482]  Certainly, yeah.
[02:12:07.482 --> 02:12:19.831]  I've pledged $10,000 to this second round of the Building What campaign in order to pay to have these commercials appear on the air again in New York City.
[02:12:19.831 --> 02:12:21.352]  So, you know, hopefully
[02:12:22.461 --> 02:12:43.389]  Your listeners will respond like they did before and be willing to put a little bit of their money into the pot and try to do what corporate television won't do and that's show this building collapse on TV so that people can get a look at some of them for the first time and maybe it'll affect their judgment about what happened that day.
[02:12:44.011 --> 02:12:48.394]  Now, Mark, and then I want to get Tony's take on this.
[02:12:48.394 --> 02:12:54.477]  For those that don't know, because we're on so many Eminem stations, there's new folks tuning in to this for the first time right now.
[02:12:54.477 --> 02:12:57.599]  What does the Building What campaign deal with?
[02:12:57.599 --> 02:13:00.161]  Why is it called Building What?
[02:13:00.161 --> 02:13:06.325]  It deals solely with Building 7, the third tower.
[02:13:06.325 --> 02:13:08.566]  It collapsed on 9-11 at about 5-20 in the afternoon.
[02:13:11.842 --> 02:13:24.393]  The people responsible for this campaign and for getting these television commercials on the air is NYC Can, New York City Coalition for Accountability Now.
[02:13:24.393 --> 02:13:32.580]  They attempted a couple years ago to have this issue considered by the City Council of New York.
[02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:37.485]  They wanted to present this issue, have witnesses, and
[02:13:38.382 --> 02:13:45.124]  Somehow spur a separate investigation by City Council in New York.
[02:13:45.124 --> 02:13:57.368]  And during that time period, when one of the members of NYC Can mentioned Building 7 while addressing the judge for the city, his comment was, Building what?
[02:13:57.368 --> 02:14:05.951]  Because, like many people, apparently he wasn't familiar with that building or the fact that it collapsed that day.
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:18.977]  That kind of, in a nutshell, crystallizes public opinion about this issue and the lack of information and the lack of awareness about what happened to Building 7.
[02:14:18.977 --> 02:14:21.401]  So, that is how it became the name of the campaign.
[02:14:22.486 --> 02:14:27.650]  Well, it's beautiful, and we're going to give folks the URL out in a moment to the Building What website.
[02:14:27.650 --> 02:14:29.771]  We're also going to play the original ad.
[02:14:29.771 --> 02:14:35.055]  But Mark, I'm telling you, this campaign was a lot more successful than I even thought it would be.
[02:14:35.055 --> 02:14:43.061]  When I asked my listeners, you know, if they believed in it to donate to it up front with that original seed money, then others joined in.
[02:14:43.061 --> 02:14:47.324]  I wasn't sure it would have any effect at all, but I knew that laying down
[02:14:48.384 --> 02:14:48.605]  I don't
[02:15:10.645 --> 02:15:15.229]  And it clearly spurred courage for Geraldo Rivera.
[02:15:15.229 --> 02:15:21.335]  I won't play it again because of time constraints, but he said, wow, I've now met with a family who lost their son.
[02:15:21.335 --> 02:15:24.798]  These engineers, building seven, very suspicious.
[02:15:24.798 --> 02:15:26.600]  This needs to be looked into.
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:27.480]  I'm suspicious.
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:28.661]  This is legitimate.
[02:15:28.661 --> 02:15:31.224]  And then Napolitano on Fox of all places,
[02:15:31.744 --> 02:15:35.246]  To step up with even more courage, and now they've tried to get him fired.
[02:15:35.246 --> 02:15:36.246]  Need to stand with him.
[02:15:36.246 --> 02:15:45.331]  I mean, this isn't a game here, but I'm really very surprised and very happy at just how effective the Building What campaign has been.
[02:15:45.331 --> 02:15:57.157]  So I want to salute everybody involved with it, and of course you, Mark, and Mr. Zamboni, and everybody else, because we're having an effect here, and the system's got to be scared.
[02:15:57.157 --> 02:15:58.238]  Mark, what's your take on that?
[02:15:59.403 --> 02:16:00.743]  Well, I agree.
[02:16:00.743 --> 02:16:05.045]  I think the people at NYC CAN deserve a lot of credit.
[02:16:05.045 --> 02:16:07.886]  They have worked hard on this issue for years.
[02:16:07.886 --> 02:16:11.327]  They have refused to let this issue die.
[02:16:11.327 --> 02:16:24.410]  That has mainly come about as a result of the dedication of not only the family members, the remaining family members who are involved with NYC CAN, but all the other institutions and all the other groups of people that are involved.
[02:16:24.410 --> 02:16:26.111]  The firefighters, the pilots,
[02:16:27.024 --> 02:16:34.388]  Like you mentioned, the architects and the engineers, former military and intelligence people.
[02:16:34.388 --> 02:16:38.590]  There's a whole lot of credibility behind this movement.
[02:16:38.590 --> 02:16:43.073]  And it's not, you know, you have all the different areas represented.
[02:16:43.073 --> 02:16:45.974]  You have people whose family members were involved.
[02:16:45.974 --> 02:16:49.436]  You have people whose background involves expertise in these areas.
[02:16:50.373 --> 02:16:57.307]  Everyone who has reason to be skeptical has joined forces in this group to come together.
[02:16:58.126 --> 02:17:04.729]  to kind of pierce the censorship bubble that has existed around, you know, the collapse of Building 7.
[02:17:04.729 --> 02:17:22.136]  As you mentioned earlier, internationally now, for several years, there has been quite a bit of skepticism about the official story of 9-11, and there have been people around the world in leadership positions who have spoken out and have expressed their skepticism.
[02:17:22.136 --> 02:17:27.638]  I think, fortunately, what this campaign has done here in New York
[02:17:28.797 --> 02:17:42.862]  It's kind of enabled that to happen to a certain extent in America because of the immediate blackout regarding some of the truths of September 11th.
[02:17:42.862 --> 02:17:52.146]  I think the public and certainly some politicians have been slow to react compared to what's going on in other countries.
[02:17:52.904 --> 02:18:07.608]  But fortunately, it looks like thus far, these commercials have served as an impetus to get people to kind of shrug off their apathy and address this issue and look at it with new eyes, so to speak.
[02:18:07.608 --> 02:18:10.649]  And, you know, hopefully try to do something about it.
[02:18:10.649 --> 02:18:19.971]  So it's almost like some big offensive lineman breaking open a hole so that the truth, that running back, can run right through and get a touchdown.
[02:18:19.971 --> 02:18:21.692]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:18:23.129 --> 02:18:28.894]  When you have the truth on your side, it's only a question of time before it comes out.
[02:18:28.894 --> 02:18:46.569]  I mean, if you have dedicated people who feel strongly about this issue, who are not going to go away, they have, like I said, for many reasons, a lot of people involved behind this campaign have a lot of incentive to see it succeed.
[02:18:47.430 --> 02:18:58.678]  And fortunately, all that dedication and years of hard work is yielding some results right now, which is very encouraging.
[02:18:58.678 --> 02:19:08.625]  And that's why I continue to be involved because, you know, in light of the effect that this has had, everybody who is a part of it would certainly like to see it continue.
[02:19:09.145 --> 02:19:15.729]  Well, we're going to come back with Mark Stepnoski and, of course, Mechanical Engineer Tony Zambotti.
[02:19:15.729 --> 02:19:17.189]  Just absolutely amazing.
[02:19:17.189 --> 02:19:32.437]  We'll also look back at Building 7 and why it's so important and the key to exposing the cover-up and the fraud that is 9-11 and how 9-11's now been used for the naked body scanners, the threat fusion centers, the police state, all these illegal wars.
[02:19:32.437 --> 02:19:35.119]  And we're the building what campaign is going next.
[02:19:35.919 --> 02:19:40.681]  It's had a huge effect, and we've never been making this much progress for 9-11 Truth.
[02:19:40.681 --> 02:19:42.961]  The system is really scared.
[02:19:42.961 --> 02:19:47.383]  We'll also talk to Mark and Tony about why they have the courage to go public.
[02:19:47.383 --> 02:19:48.543]  You know, why they're doing it.
[02:19:48.543 --> 02:19:49.744]  I mean, I know why deep down.
[02:19:49.744 --> 02:19:53.025]  I can answer their question for them, because they can't stand corruption.
[02:19:53.025 --> 02:19:54.525]  They can't stand lies.
[02:19:54.525 --> 02:19:56.086]  They have a sense of justice.
[02:19:56.086 --> 02:19:58.967]  We'll discuss it all with these patriots on the other side.
[02:19:58.967 --> 02:19:59.407]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.547 --> 02:20:02.848]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.848 --> 02:20:08.455]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.455 --> 02:20:13.460]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:18.506]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:19.026 --> 02:20:24.251]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:24.251 --> 02:20:31.378]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:31.378 --> 02:20:32.499]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.499 --> 02:20:38.865]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:39.165 --> 02:20:42.366]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:42.366 --> 02:20:44.587]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:44.587 --> 02:20:45.367]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.367 --> 02:20:45.667]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.667 --> 02:20:49.169]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:49.169 --> 02:20:50.889]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:01.769 --> 02:21:02.790]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:08.332]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:21:08.332 --> 02:21:08.873]  I get it.
[02:21:08.873 --> 02:21:18.497]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:21:18.497 --> 02:21:19.658]  That's not what's happening.
[02:21:19.898 --> 02:21:28.362]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:21:28.362 --> 02:21:31.764]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:21:31.764 --> 02:21:36.026]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:21:36.026 --> 02:21:37.626]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:21:37.626 --> 02:21:41.588]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:21:41.588 --> 02:21:45.190]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:21:45.390 --> 02:21:46.291]  You should too.
[02:21:46.291 --> 02:21:47.451]  Find out what they know.
[02:21:47.451 --> 02:21:50.753]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:21:50.753 --> 02:21:50.813]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:50.813 --> 02:21:51.133]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.133 --> 02:21:51.333]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:02.245 --> 02:22:06.269]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:22:06.269 --> 02:22:09.513]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:22:09.513 --> 02:22:14.318]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:22:14.318 --> 02:22:20.704]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:20.704 --> 02:22:22.947]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:22:23.467 --> 02:22:23.767]  Tim Geithner?
[02:22:23.767 --> 02:22:24.027]  Bernanke?
[02:22:24.027 --> 02:22:24.607]  They're arsonists!
[02:22:24.607 --> 02:22:25.408]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:25.408 --> 02:22:27.088]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:42.372 --> 02:22:49.657]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:23:06.319 --> 02:23:07.179]  Why Ali-C?
[02:23:07.179 --> 02:23:10.741]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[02:23:10.741 --> 02:23:18.426]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[02:23:18.806 --> 02:23:24.389]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:29.591]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[02:23:29.591 --> 02:23:33.293]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[02:23:33.293 --> 02:23:39.436]  Ali-C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[02:23:39.736 --> 02:23:44.538]  So boost your body's resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Ali-C.

[02:24:34.425 --> 02:24:35.385]  He's a patriot.
[02:24:35.385 --> 02:24:37.907]  Only news links on the Mews website.
[02:24:37.907 --> 02:24:41.150]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:24:41.150 --> 02:24:41.991]  I'm not bragging.
[02:24:41.991 --> 02:24:43.572]  I'm saying look at the effect.
[02:24:43.572 --> 02:24:47.876]  How many other great people of courage are stepping up and standing out?
[02:24:47.876 --> 02:24:54.161]  Matt Bellamy at concerts has talked about Inside Job, worn Terror Storm t-shirts promoting my film.
[02:24:54.161 --> 02:25:00.987]  As more and more prominent people, Willie Nelson, the list goes on and on, stand up with courage, it's over for the system.
[02:25:01.693 --> 02:25:02.853]  It's over!
[02:25:02.853 --> 02:25:15.697]  And more and more people can now have courage standing on the shoulders of people like Mark Stepnoski, again, two-time Super Bowl winner, five-time pro bowler, NFL Cowboy Center.
[02:25:15.697 --> 02:25:26.280]  We've also got Tony Zambotti, mechanical engineer, part of Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth, waking up Geraldo Rivera, chain reaction into Judge Knapp.
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:27.981]  Very exciting.
[02:25:27.981 --> 02:25:31.284]  In this brief segment, we're gonna hold you guys throughout the hour, and I appreciate your time.
[02:25:31.284 --> 02:25:36.348]  I wanna play the Building What ad, give out the website, it's buildingwhat.org.
[02:25:36.348 --> 02:25:46.857]  Running through to the end of the year, the next three days, today, Thursday, and Friday, he's giving 10,000, and he hopes to match those that give 10,000.
[02:25:46.857 --> 02:25:49.620]  I'm told our listeners gave about 30 the first time we did this.
[02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:51.321]  That sounds like a lot, it's not.
[02:25:51.321 --> 02:25:54.224]  But those few ads in New York, because the ad's effective,
[02:25:54.684 --> 02:25:56.145]  Well, I watched the Towers come down live at work.
[02:25:56.145 --> 02:26:02.027]  We were in a design review, and we heard that there was a first and a second plane hit, and at break time, of course, we went up to the cafeteria.
[02:26:19.850 --> 02:26:26.514]  And, uh, you know, most big companies have TVs in the cafeterias and we're watching the towers while they're burning.
[02:26:26.514 --> 02:26:31.498]  And, uh, you know, next thing you know, one comes down South Tower and then a half hour later to North Tower.
[02:26:31.498 --> 02:26:36.241]  And I'm just, I was shaking my head, uh, wondering where all the energy came from.
[02:26:36.241 --> 02:26:38.082]  I'm not saying I was suspicious.
[02:26:38.082 --> 02:26:40.223]  It just didn't seem right.
[02:26:40.223 --> 02:26:42.965]  And coming home from work that night, I heard about Building 7 and, uh,
[02:26:45.037 --> 02:26:47.579]  That just perplexed me.
[02:26:47.579 --> 02:26:49.681]  And I'm thinking it had to be right up next to the tower.
[02:26:49.681 --> 02:26:50.862]  It's been completely gutted.
[02:26:50.862 --> 02:26:53.925]  They said there was diesel fires in it they couldn't put out.
[02:26:53.925 --> 02:26:56.448]  It just didn't seem right.
[02:26:56.448 --> 02:26:58.970]  You know, knowing they described the size of the building.
[02:26:59.754 --> 02:27:04.378]  And in case anybody doesn't know, most people should know, but they really need to think about it.
[02:27:04.378 --> 02:27:08.221]  I use football field mark as an analogy here.
[02:27:08.221 --> 02:27:10.783]  Imagine being on a football field.
[02:27:10.783 --> 02:27:13.626]  That's how big that building was in plan, an area.
[02:27:13.626 --> 02:27:16.168]  Each floor is a football field in size.
[02:27:16.168 --> 02:27:21.052]  And you would have a large column every five yards on the perimeter.
[02:27:21.052 --> 02:27:23.574]  Then you'd have the same size columns.
[02:27:24.767 --> 02:27:31.709]  From the 20-yard line to the 20-yard line, and then three abreast, another 24 in the middle.
[02:27:31.709 --> 02:27:36.450]  And imagine that thing coming down at free-fall acceleration for 105 feet.
[02:27:36.450 --> 02:27:38.631]  This thing was 610 foot tall.
[02:27:38.631 --> 02:27:41.592]  It's immense, immense.
[02:27:41.592 --> 02:27:45.993]  I don't think people really fully appreciate it when they see the film, the immensity of this building.
[02:27:47.063 --> 02:27:48.824]  In most cities, it'd be the biggest.
[02:27:48.824 --> 02:27:52.126]  I mean, in Austin, it'd be the biggest.
[02:27:52.126 --> 02:27:54.428]  It'd be the second biggest building in Dallas.
[02:27:54.428 --> 02:27:57.370]  Well, they're saying in 33 states it would be the biggest building.
[02:27:57.370 --> 02:28:00.412]  Okay, but it's not just the height, Alex.
[02:28:00.412 --> 02:28:06.756]  It's the immensity, the size, the football field in width and length.
[02:28:06.756 --> 02:28:08.177]  And then 610 foot tall.
[02:28:08.177 --> 02:28:09.578]  That's a humongous building.
[02:28:10.319 --> 02:28:12.220]  It's absolutely immense.
[02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:18.905]  And for that to come down at freefall acceleration, it went into, it was like it went over a cliff.
[02:28:18.905 --> 02:28:23.408]  And it's not moving, and all of a sudden, boom, it goes into freefall acceleration.
[02:28:23.408 --> 02:28:24.289]  That's impossible.
[02:28:24.289 --> 02:28:30.993]  And by the way, NIST had denied for nine years, or eight and a half years at the time, that there was freefall.
[02:28:30.993 --> 02:28:37.698]  Now they've had to admit there was freefall, because under Newtonian physics, as you know as an engineer, it's impossible unless they blew it.
[02:28:38.291 --> 02:28:39.051]  That's right.
[02:28:39.051 --> 02:28:41.472]  They played a couple games.
[02:28:41.472 --> 02:28:43.173]  First of all, they only measured two points.
[02:28:43.173 --> 02:28:44.733]  They took an average.
[02:28:44.733 --> 02:28:51.435]  And David Chandler, a physicist from California, forced them to admit the free fall, which they admit to as part of it.
[02:28:51.435 --> 02:28:56.437]  They have this 5.4 seconds that they say their model comes out of.
[02:28:56.437 --> 02:29:03.159]  It comes down to the 29th floor, the first 18 stories you can see, and then it's cut off in the view because of a building in front of it.
[02:29:03.829 --> 02:29:11.475]  But they say that first 18 floors came down in 5.4 seconds, but in reality it was 3.9.
[02:29:11.475 --> 02:29:12.716]  So they were 40% over.
[02:29:12.716 --> 02:29:16.158]  And they did that because that's all they could get their model to come down in.
[02:29:16.158 --> 02:29:17.880]  So their model doesn't replicate the failure.
[02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:19.441]  Their model never goes into freefall.
[02:29:20.146 --> 02:29:29.975]  So, you know, it was whether it was an attempt at subterfuge or not, it was incorrect, and they did not replicate the failure.
[02:29:29.975 --> 02:29:39.303]  And if anybody that's seen, and they can see it in this model on the buildingwatch.org website, their model doesn't look like what you see in the video at all.
[02:29:39.303 --> 02:29:42.005]  There's tremendous deformation of the building at the
[02:29:42.265 --> 02:29:44.286]  All right, Tony, stay there.
[02:29:44.286 --> 02:29:44.886]  Mark, stay there.
[02:29:44.886 --> 02:29:50.268]  We're gonna come right back, play the Building 1 ad, ask folks to donate, get into a lot more.
[02:29:50.268 --> 02:29:51.588]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.588 --> 02:29:55.510]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:58.191]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.396 --> 02:30:05.137]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[02:31:01.036 --> 02:31:02.217]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:02.217 --> 02:31:09.141]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:09.141 --> 02:31:11.703]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.703 --> 02:31:17.086]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:17.086 --> 02:31:20.128]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:20.128 --> 02:31:22.189]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.429 --> 02:31:28.673]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.673 --> 02:31:32.055]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:32.055 --> 02:31:37.859]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.859 --> 02:31:39.480]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:40.780]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.780 --> 02:31:43.462]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.462 --> 02:31:44.863]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:31:45.163 --> 02:31:47.125]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.

[02:33:03.150 --> 02:33:12.685]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:33:12.685 --> 02:33:14.247]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:14.247 --> 02:33:17.933]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:20.054 --> 02:33:31.804]  A lot of people early on, when I was talking about 9-11 and how they were planning to blow up the World Trade Center two months before it happened, and then on the day that it happened, when I was talking about the controlled demolition, they said, it's so rude.
[02:33:31.804 --> 02:33:35.027]  It's, well, I mean, the truth isn't rude.
[02:33:35.027 --> 02:33:36.408]  The truth is the truth.
[02:33:36.408 --> 02:33:46.137]  Buying into a fable that is then used to destroy our republic and our freedoms and have an iron curtain of tyranny lower down over the planet, that is not
[02:33:47.805 --> 02:33:49.886]  Something that's obviously good for society.
[02:33:49.886 --> 02:33:53.309]  Only the truth will set us free.
[02:33:53.309 --> 02:34:01.294]  And the truth is, there are many governments, the Russians, our own, that it's been declassified as staged terror attacks.
[02:34:02.370 --> 02:34:09.032]  And regardless of who you think was really behind it, we know the official story is a lie, is a fraud.
[02:34:09.032 --> 02:34:18.174]  And if we don't expose this fraud, then the system is gonna continue to use it to bring in a new dark age of control.
[02:34:18.174 --> 02:34:21.095]  Talking to Mark Stipnoski, Mark, when did you first start?
[02:34:21.095 --> 02:34:28.897]  I mean, I think I first interviewed you like four or five years ago, but when did you first start to question the official fable of 9-11, and why did you decide
[02:34:29.457 --> 02:34:35.422]  You know, a guy who'd made tens of millions of dollars, very successful, successful in business, you know, great family.
[02:34:35.422 --> 02:34:40.045]  What made you decide to take that plunge and do something that you knew that you could be attacked for?
[02:34:40.045 --> 02:34:47.331]  I was skeptical of events the day it happened.
[02:34:47.331 --> 02:34:54.257]  I don't say that, you know, to try and sound like a know-it-all in retrospect, but I say that because leading up to that point,
[02:34:55.222 --> 02:35:07.265]  Throughout my life, I had read a lot about the Kennedy assassination, and the Iran-Contra affair, and the Murrah building blowing up in Oklahoma City.
[02:35:07.265 --> 02:35:12.326]  I'd read a lot about those historical events throughout my life.
[02:35:12.326 --> 02:35:24.649]  And, you know, I'd studied them, and kind of became aware of the inconsistencies in all those stories, and how, you know, what the truth was was not something that was highlighted in corporate media.
[02:35:25.746 --> 02:35:33.869]  So, as I watched the events unfold that day in 2001, I felt much the way Tony did.
[02:35:33.869 --> 02:35:37.710]  Although, admittedly, I am no expert and don't claim to be.
[02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:48.194]  But just watching that second tower go down that day, looking at the television, I said to myself, that doesn't look like that's from any kind of fire.
[02:35:48.194 --> 02:35:54.396]  You know, I mean, just even myself, a lay person, right, a professional football player at the time,
[02:35:55.163 --> 02:35:59.927]  Just logic could tell you by watching that on TV that that was an explosion.
[02:35:59.927 --> 02:36:04.071]  That was a building disintegrating into powder in front of your eyes.
[02:36:04.071 --> 02:36:06.874]  That was obviously not from a fire.
[02:36:06.874 --> 02:36:15.622]  So my thinking was just to wait and see if the system would
[02:36:16.380 --> 02:36:19.163]  I would correct this issue.
[02:36:19.163 --> 02:36:35.561]  As time went on, and you'd like to think that any kind of structures within government that are built to detect and ferret out corruption and bring people to justice, you'd like to see those mechanisms go into effect.
[02:36:36.461 --> 02:36:50.191]  And it appeared to be that way when the 9-11 Commission was first put together, although it was obvious with how long it took and how little money was given to it that it was never really a serious attempt to get to the bottom of things.
[02:36:50.191 --> 02:36:58.097]  And then once the Commission was finished and the former members spoke out, that view was cemented and everybody realized that it was just a cover-up.
[02:36:59.381 --> 02:37:13.426]  So honestly, just having the misgivings that I originally had and knowing what I knew about previous events where the public was not told the truth, it got to the point where it became apparent that, you know,
[02:37:14.412 --> 02:37:20.154]  Certain mechanisms were not going to kick in, and the system was not going to correct itself.
[02:37:20.154 --> 02:37:33.960]  It became obvious that this corruption was going to go unpunished, and that, as you said, this event was going to be used as a pretext for a whole agenda that was put in place, you know, prior to September 11, 2001.
[02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:40.423]  So I just reached the point where, like many other concerned citizens who have donated far more time and effort than I have,
[02:37:41.836 --> 02:37:56.416]  After researching the event, reading about it online or in books, or going to see people give presentations, you know, speakers who don't believe in the official story,
[02:37:57.316 --> 02:38:02.662]  All this kind of added up to me just wanting to do something about it myself, just as any concerned citizen would do.
[02:38:02.662 --> 02:38:11.313]  You know, if you're somewhere, you know, you want your voice to be heard, you want to believe that you live in some semblance of a democracy,
[02:38:13.052 --> 02:38:15.933]  It was just a case of putting my money where my mouth is.
[02:38:15.933 --> 02:38:17.973]  Well, if you see something, say something.
[02:38:17.973 --> 02:38:24.015]  But it's like this airline pilot sees that the airports are wide open for everybody but the pilots and passengers.
[02:38:24.015 --> 02:38:25.555]  He puts out a video.
[02:38:25.555 --> 02:38:27.615]  They raid his house.
[02:38:27.615 --> 02:38:29.836]  Now there's going to be a congressional investigation.
[02:38:29.836 --> 02:38:32.477]  Now the feds are backing off the pilot's courage.
[02:38:32.477 --> 02:38:37.278]  We learn they only want us not trusting each other and spying on each other.
[02:38:37.278 --> 02:38:42.479]  They don't want us seeing buildings blown up in front of us to use our own common sense.
[02:38:42.939 --> 02:38:55.092]  But to use the football analogy, which I use a lot, not just when I have a two-time Super Bowl champ on with me, I can clearly say now that they were winning nine years ago.
[02:38:55.092 --> 02:39:01.419]  About three years ago, we began to fight back and started to turn the tide.
[02:39:01.419 --> 02:39:04.982]  But I have to say 9-11 Truth wasn't winning.
[02:39:05.683 --> 02:39:15.399]  Until about the last year or so, and now this buildingwhat.org campaign I think has really been a game changer, Mark.
[02:39:15.399 --> 02:39:16.200]  What's your take on that?
[02:39:17.264 --> 02:39:18.144]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:39:18.144 --> 02:39:29.251]  I think it's, you know, it's had a definite impact, and that's the reason why the people involved chose to continue, because they could see the effect that it was having.
[02:39:29.251 --> 02:39:42.358]  They were certainly getting bang for their buck, and they were accomplishing what they originally set out to do, which was to have this demolition shown on TV, I believe, on the day of September 11th.
[02:39:42.358 --> 02:39:44.319]  It was shown once and never shown again.
[02:39:45.217 --> 02:39:50.479]  Um, so it's just a case of getting it out there and educating the public.
[02:39:50.479 --> 02:40:05.466]  You know, people who have not seen this building go down, who some are not even aware of it, can now look back on it with a different perspective, with maybe a little bit less emotion clouding their judgment.
[02:40:06.394 --> 02:40:20.077]  Now that they're a little bit removed from that day and can respond and view something more with logic and less with just gut reaction, maybe people will be a little bit more willing to open their eyes.
[02:40:20.077 --> 02:40:22.277]  Well, here's the $64 million question.
[02:40:22.277 --> 02:40:29.618]  I want to throw it to you, Mark, and then, of course, to the engineer, Tony, who's here with us.
[02:40:29.618 --> 02:40:32.359]  But not just their overall agenda of global
[02:40:32.719 --> 02:40:33.499]  We're good to go.
[02:41:02.686 --> 02:41:06.208]  Well, that's true.
[02:41:06.208 --> 02:41:08.509]  I mean, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[02:41:08.509 --> 02:41:13.392]  And when you have people who, you know, they have the military hegemony that the U.S.
[02:41:13.392 --> 02:41:22.897]  has now throughout the world, when you have ownership of the corporate media and you can control the message and censor any information that might come out,
[02:41:24.497 --> 02:41:25.638]  And that's what you will get.
[02:41:25.638 --> 02:41:28.520]  You will have democracy being subverted.
[02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:40.829]  It is up to people like those in New York, in NYC can, and all the groups, you know, like I said, firefighters, pilots, architects, engineers, when I live in truth.
[02:41:40.829 --> 02:41:46.813]  It is up to those people to be involved in truly what is a citizen's movement.
[02:41:46.813 --> 02:41:51.357]  You know, this is, I'm proud to be involved because it's a grassroots movement.
[02:41:51.357 --> 02:41:51.717]  You know, it's
[02:41:52.441 --> 02:41:56.623]  I empathize with the people that have family members die that day.
[02:41:56.623 --> 02:41:58.324]  That could have been any one of us.
[02:41:58.324 --> 02:42:05.006]  Those people were just victims of circumstance, and now their family members are left with a bunch of unanswered questions.
[02:42:05.006 --> 02:42:06.647]  That could be any one of us.
[02:42:06.647 --> 02:42:10.829]  If any one of us was in that situation, we would be doing the same thing.
[02:42:10.829 --> 02:42:18.472]  You know, some people were, in a sense, bought off by the settlement money that was paid out to family, the remaining family members.
[02:42:19.625 --> 02:42:22.930]  But there's a small percentage that was not.
[02:42:22.930 --> 02:42:30.642]  They've continued to fight and to push this issue because they don't want to let it go because they know that they're being lied to.
[02:42:31.488 --> 02:42:36.513]  So it's just, like I said, I'm happy to be a part of it.
[02:42:36.513 --> 02:42:41.697]  And, you know, sometimes I get the attitude from people that, hey, you know, he's just an ex-football player.
[02:42:41.697 --> 02:42:42.918]  What does he know?
[02:42:42.918 --> 02:42:45.200]  And I tell people, fine, don't believe me.
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:46.201]  Don't listen to me.
[02:42:46.201 --> 02:42:54.569]  Because there are people far more educated in this area than I am who have every bit as much, if not more, skepticism than I do.
[02:42:54.569 --> 02:42:57.912]  If you don't want to believe me just because I'm a guy who used to play football, that's fine.
[02:42:58.092 --> 02:43:04.378]  Yeah, what about the former German defense minister, the former head of German intelligence, the former Italian president?
[02:43:04.378 --> 02:43:06.560]  What about all these thousands of architects and engineers?
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:12.545]  What about all the police and firemen I've talked to and medics who heard the Building 7 countdown?
[02:43:12.545 --> 02:43:16.268]  I mean, what about the police on video saying, get back, they're going to blow up 7?
[02:43:16.268 --> 02:43:18.050]  I mean, it's all right.
[02:43:18.510 --> 02:43:19.551]  They're in front of us.
[02:43:41.124 --> 02:43:42.505]  For a new investigation.
[02:43:42.505 --> 02:43:44.728]  They're at the city level of 9-11.
[02:43:44.728 --> 02:43:46.309]  And their petitions got thrown out.
[02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:49.132]  And the judge said, building what?
[02:43:49.132 --> 02:43:50.793]  When they brought up building 7.
[02:43:50.793 --> 02:43:54.677]  So that was the genesis of the building what campaign.
[02:43:54.677 --> 02:43:59.642]  Here is the public service announcement with family members of 9-11 victims.
[02:43:59.642 --> 02:43:59.942]  Here it is.
[02:44:00.242 --> 02:44:04.665]  I lost my son, my nephew, my uncle, my son on September 11th, 2001.
[02:44:04.665 --> 02:44:08.307]  Most people don't know that a third tower fell on September 11th.
[02:44:08.307 --> 02:44:12.550]  World Trade Center 7, a 47-story skyscraper, was not hit by a plane.
[02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:22.157]  Although the official explanation is that fire brought down Building 7, over 1,200 architects and engineers have looked into the evidence and believe there is more to the story.
[02:44:22.157 --> 02:44:27.700]  Bring justice to my son, my uncle, my nephew, my son, and thousands of others who died on September 11th.
[02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:29.602]  Go to buildingwhat.org.
[02:44:30.502 --> 02:44:31.583]  We're good to go.
[02:44:51.693 --> 02:44:54.754]  We have seen a huge effect, because this is very effective.
[02:44:54.754 --> 02:44:58.576]  At first it shows Building 7 falling, something most people haven't seen.
[02:44:58.576 --> 02:45:00.817]  The media never wanted to cover it then or afterwards.
[02:45:00.817 --> 02:45:03.818]  I mean, you never hear about Building 7 in the media.
[02:45:03.818 --> 02:45:05.499]  But it also shows victims.
[02:45:05.499 --> 02:45:10.681]  Now, I've had some of the heads of the biggest 9-11 victims' families on the show.
[02:45:10.681 --> 02:45:11.942]  I'll get them on about
[02:45:12.947 --> 02:45:14.629]  Other issues with 9-11.
[02:45:14.629 --> 02:45:19.413]  And in every case, I say what percentage of your group believe it's an inside job?
[02:45:19.413 --> 02:45:21.314]  And they say more than half.
[02:45:21.314 --> 02:45:23.696]  And I've been on the streets and had firemen and police
[02:45:24.753 --> 02:45:25.494]  Shake my hand.
[02:45:45.932 --> 02:45:55.256]  Well, I just wanted to say, I wanted to repeat what I said on Gerardo's show, that there's an absolute proof.
[02:45:55.256 --> 02:46:02.740]  You know, I tend to try to follow, and I think what the Building What Campaign is doing is, you know, the KISS principle.
[02:46:02.740 --> 02:46:05.421]  Keep it simple and straightforward.
[02:46:14.404 --> 02:46:17.107]  Um, and Building 7 does that.
[02:46:17.107 --> 02:46:27.518]  And like I said on Geraldo, it's impossible, it's absolutely impossible, I can't stress that enough, for that building to go into free-fall acceleration in a natural way.
[02:46:27.518 --> 02:46:31.923]  For 8 stories, 8 13 foot tall stories, or 105 feet.
[02:46:31.923 --> 02:46:35.867]  Because when columns, in a natural collapse, columns would have to buckle.
[02:46:36.943 --> 02:46:40.045]  And when they, when columns buckle, there's a minimum resistance.
[02:46:40.045 --> 02:46:42.306]  It's what we call asymptotic.
[02:46:42.306 --> 02:46:43.767]  You guys probably saw this in school.
[02:46:43.767 --> 02:46:49.490]  It's when the curve comes down and never drops down to the x-axis to the next y-graph.
[02:46:49.490 --> 02:46:53.192]  And in this case, the buckling resistance is significant.
[02:46:53.192 --> 02:46:55.133]  It's not even near zero.
[02:46:55.133 --> 02:46:58.294]  It's 10 to 25% of the intact strength.
[02:46:58.294 --> 02:47:02.937]  So what I want to say there, it's not just 10 to 25% of the resistance because you have a factor of safety.
[02:47:03.746 --> 02:47:09.409]  The columns in Building 7 were anywhere from 3 to 5 was the factory safety.
[02:47:09.409 --> 02:47:16.614]  In other words, they could support a load above them that was 300 to 500 percent greater than what they actually had on them.
[02:47:16.614 --> 02:47:20.556]  So when I say it retained 10 to 25 percent of its impact strength, that means
[02:47:21.346 --> 02:47:29.533]  Even if they were buckling, completely scissor-folded, they could still support a load that was 30 to 75 percent of the load that was on them.
[02:47:29.533 --> 02:47:31.875]  That means it can never go to freefall.
[02:47:31.875 --> 02:47:32.935]  It's completely impossible.
[02:47:32.935 --> 02:47:34.837]  So let's say one level did buckle.
[02:47:34.837 --> 02:47:43.043]  It wouldn't have been symmetrical, A. B, you would have had it collapsing in chunks.
[02:47:43.043 --> 02:47:46.066]  It would have taken time for each floor to collapse.
[02:47:46.466 --> 02:47:54.593]  And there's another area that I know you can quantify, I forget the exact term they use, but the pile was too short.
[02:47:54.593 --> 02:48:01.138]  These things had been blown into manageable sections, just like a controlled demolition.
[02:48:01.138 --> 02:48:11.726]  A lot of people say that, but what this tries to say is that they had an internal failure on the east side, the east penthouse went down, and that internal collapse progressed from east to west.
[02:48:12.651 --> 02:48:13.471]  Completely!
[02:48:13.471 --> 02:48:19.574]  And then all of a sudden the entire exterior shell, which was standing on its own prior to that, comes down in free fall.
[02:48:19.574 --> 02:48:24.756]  Well, that's impossible, because they try to say, Alex, that it's a multi-story buckle.
[02:48:24.756 --> 02:48:34.480]  That's very, very unlikely to have happened with that complete sheet, because those column connections on the outside columns were moment-resistant.
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:37.041]  The whole face is not going to buckle, and in addition to that,
[02:48:37.839 --> 02:48:48.043]  Well, if the east side was coming down inside and the outside and the whole thing came down, why wouldn't the east side perimeter come down before the west side?
[02:48:48.043 --> 02:48:52.685]  Why wait for the whole building, the whole interior was down before the whole building to come down?
[02:48:52.685 --> 02:48:54.065]  That's not what happened.
[02:48:54.065 --> 02:49:02.609]  What really happened, find that east penthouse came down a little, that was dropped for some reason, but then the whole interior was dropped just a split second.
[02:49:03.329 --> 02:49:16.595]  And you watch the top, the HVAC area, the parapet up on top, the heat exchangers, that area just dips in the middle, it goes a little past the middle of the building, then the whole exterior drops.
[02:49:16.595 --> 02:49:18.036]  It goes into a sudden collapse.
[02:49:18.462 --> 02:49:30.427]  Well, sir, from structural engineers I've talked to, and then I've seen the Las Vegas implosions, with that design of a building, you want to blow the central columns first, so that when you blow the others, it doesn't fall out and damage other buildings.
[02:49:30.427 --> 02:49:30.727]  That's right.
[02:49:30.727 --> 02:49:40.991]  You want to lean into the center, so it drags in, it just puts a little force on the outside, pulls it inward a little bit, so that everything comes down with a little bit of an inward pull, and then comes straight down.
[02:49:41.631 --> 02:49:43.294]  That's exactly why it's done.
[02:49:43.294 --> 02:49:46.700]  What you just said is exactly why it's done.
[02:49:46.700 --> 02:49:54.172]  It was, in fact, the largest classical or traditional controlled demolition in history.
[02:49:55.209 --> 02:49:56.130]  It was a masterpiece.
[02:49:56.130 --> 02:49:58.872]  They tried to blow up the Intel building here in Austin.
[02:49:58.872 --> 02:50:02.054]  It was a modern building that never finished because Intel had financial problems.
[02:50:02.054 --> 02:50:06.377]  They built it in 99, blew it up just a few years ago, and they failed.
[02:50:06.377 --> 02:50:10.601]  Mark, I mean, again, it's just, it's hidden in plain view, Mark.
[02:50:10.601 --> 02:50:15.845]  Yeah, I'd like to get back to something that Tony said about just keeping it simple.
[02:50:15.845 --> 02:50:20.248]  There's never been a building collapse due to fire, ever.
[02:50:20.248 --> 02:50:24.391]  You know, when you look at what NIST is trying to say and, you know, everything else,
[02:50:25.664 --> 02:50:31.066]  They're trying to get people to accept an impossibility.
[02:50:31.066 --> 02:50:32.907]  It's physically impossible.
[02:50:32.907 --> 02:50:34.968]  You know, Tony can back me up on this.
[02:50:34.968 --> 02:50:37.149]  I'm sure with a much more educated opinion, but...
[02:50:38.522 --> 02:50:42.764]  Diesel fires that we're burning in Building 7 are carbon-based fires.
[02:50:42.764 --> 02:50:46.425]  The carbon-based fires cannot get hot enough to melt steel.
[02:50:46.425 --> 02:50:48.046]  It's physically impossible.
[02:50:48.046 --> 02:50:49.026]  You're absolutely right, Mark.
[02:50:49.026 --> 02:50:49.386]  Stay there.
[02:50:49.386 --> 02:50:50.067]  Final segment.
[02:50:50.067 --> 02:50:51.707]  Man, this hour has gone fast.
[02:50:51.707 --> 02:50:53.888]  Folks, be part of this history-making event.
[02:50:53.888 --> 02:50:55.949]  Join the team for liberty and the truth.
[02:50:55.949 --> 02:50:58.070]  Donate at buildingwhat.org.
[02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:59.590]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:50:59.590 --> 02:51:01.231]  We'll be back with Mark Skipnosky and others.
[02:51:01.795 --> 02:51:05.876]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.876 --> 02:51:10.378]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.378 --> 02:51:16.540]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.540 --> 02:51:18.961]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.961 --> 02:51:24.923]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:25.063 --> 02:51:28.467]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.467 --> 02:51:30.349]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.349 --> 02:51:32.532]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.532 --> 02:51:37.417]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:37.417 --> 02:51:38.238]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:38.238 --> 02:51:42.283]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:42.503 --> 02:51:50.547]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:50.547 --> 02:51:51.287]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:51:51.287 --> 02:51:52.107]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:52:01.215 --> 02:52:03.597]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.597 --> 02:52:05.918]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.918 --> 02:52:09.120]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.120 --> 02:52:14.223]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.223 --> 02:52:18.426]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.726 --> 02:52:21.087]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.087 --> 02:52:23.968]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.968 --> 02:52:26.890]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.890 --> 02:52:34.493]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.813 --> 02:52:40.218]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.218 --> 02:52:43.060]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.060 --> 02:52:46.763]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.763 --> 02:52:47.824]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.824 --> 02:52:49.165]  You're everyone else.

[02:54:06.018 --> 02:54:08.299]  Well, it's our last segment.
[02:54:08.299 --> 02:54:10.340]  We've had so many guests on today.
[02:54:10.340 --> 02:54:21.426]  Coming up, when we go into retransmission, it's Webster Tarbley Filberg, Mike Adams, Porter Stansbury, Mark Stipnoski, and Tony Zambotti, engineer.
[02:54:21.426 --> 02:54:23.368]  You got cut off by the break.
[02:54:23.368 --> 02:54:27.610]  You had another point you wanted to make, Mark, about the Magic Bullet.
[02:54:28.581 --> 02:54:42.265]  Well, yeah, I just, um, as far as, you know, being told to believe a physical impossibility, you know, the linchpin... I'm glad you brought up the Kennedy assassination, because the linchpin of that argument is the magic bullet theory.
[02:54:42.265 --> 02:54:45.486]  And that's an absurd theory.
[02:54:45.486 --> 02:54:50.367]  A bullet cannot behave the way that bullet was described to behave.
[02:54:50.367 --> 02:54:57.309]  So, you know, if you're going to believe the official story of the Kennedy assassination, you're asked to believe a physical impossibility.
[02:54:58.115 --> 02:55:02.918]  And the same thing holds true for Building 7 and 9-11 in general.
[02:55:02.918 --> 02:55:07.221]  You know, a steel building has never collapsed from fire.
[02:55:07.221 --> 02:55:16.607]  If you go online, you can see examples of other buildings in different countries throughout the world that have burned for hours and hours and not come down.
[02:55:16.607 --> 02:55:18.488]  That's why they build buildings out of steel.
[02:55:18.488 --> 02:55:18.989]  That's why
[02:55:19.972 --> 02:55:28.021]  Your fireplace is made out of steel, because you put wood in there, wood is a carbon-based fire, and it can't get hot enough to burn steel.
[02:55:28.021 --> 02:55:35.949]  So, to be told that this building just got hot enough from, you know, diesel fires and collapsed,
[02:55:37.182 --> 02:55:39.903]  It is a modern-day magic bullet theory.
[02:55:39.903 --> 02:55:41.804]  It's like the magic building theory.
[02:55:41.804 --> 02:55:42.824]  Ooh, I love that!
[02:55:42.824 --> 02:55:44.525]  The magic building theory!
[02:55:44.525 --> 02:55:59.690]  You're asked to believe that this thing came down, but in reality, you know, whether it's jet fuel or wood or anything that was burning in that building, diesel, fuel, that's a carbon-based fire and it cannot get hot enough to melt steel.
[02:56:01.750 --> 02:56:02.750]  It's just impossible.
[02:56:02.750 --> 02:56:06.771]  Let me back you up on that a minute, Mark, if you would.
[02:56:06.771 --> 02:56:12.192]  The reason a lot of people, when you tell people fire can't melt steel, a lot of people don't understand why.
[02:56:12.192 --> 02:56:17.353]  And scientifically, I just want to say real quick why.
[02:56:17.353 --> 02:56:22.094]  You can melt steel in a blast furnace, but that's because you have pure oxygen.
[02:56:22.094 --> 02:56:27.795]  A pure oxygen environment allows you to get to 3,000 degrees centigrade.
[02:56:29.835 --> 02:56:38.901]  But you're only, the byproducts are carbon, it's water, I think, carbon dioxide molecule, or monoxide.
[02:56:38.901 --> 02:56:46.305]  You're only heating up two additional molecules, which takes energy, if you have to heat them up.
[02:56:46.305 --> 02:56:52.009]  In air, you have one third of the oxygen you would normally have, or a little less, actually.
[02:56:52.009 --> 02:56:56.652]  And then you also have to heat up several molecules of nitrogen.
[02:56:58.825 --> 02:57:05.129]  Yeah, but everybody knows their stove doesn't melt when they cook stuff, and those flames are blue.
[02:57:05.129 --> 02:57:05.169]  No.
[02:57:22.119 --> 02:57:22.259]  Yeah.
[02:57:35.916 --> 02:57:37.837]  Tony, I hate to interrupt you.
[02:57:37.837 --> 02:57:39.959]  We're going to have to do, I guess, five minutes of overdrive.
[02:57:39.959 --> 02:57:41.440]  I'll let you both go at five after.
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:57.231]  We're about to end the official show, but most stations carry this next hour, but I'm only going to do five minutes into overdrive like I did yesterday, because I do want to spend some time, but I want you to be able to go back, both of you, on the science of this in the next little segment, but now I just want to give the website out.
[02:57:57.231 --> 02:57:58.572]  It's Building What?
[02:58:02.414 --> 02:58:04.556]  I know I'm putting you on the spot, Tony.
[02:58:04.556 --> 02:58:09.679]  Is there a phone number for folks that can't give online?
[02:58:09.679 --> 02:58:11.381]  I don't know of one right off, Alex.
[02:58:11.381 --> 02:58:13.142]  I can find that out.
[02:58:13.142 --> 02:58:14.443]  Well, there's probably one on the website.
[02:58:14.443 --> 02:58:20.787]  I should have asked you that before both of you guys came on, but Mark Stepnoski and Tony Zambotti.
[02:58:20.787 --> 02:58:22.589]  Can both of you stay five more minutes?
[02:58:22.589 --> 02:58:23.049]  Sure.
[02:58:23.049 --> 02:58:23.789]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:58:24.690 --> 02:58:27.713]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:51.435]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.435 --> 02:58:56.001]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:58:56.001 --> 02:59:00.326]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.326 --> 02:59:05.733]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:06.073 --> 02:59:06.814]  It's true.
[02:59:06.814 --> 02:59:12.518]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:12.518 --> 02:59:16.101]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:16.101 --> 02:59:20.805]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:20.805 --> 02:59:23.567]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.567 --> 02:59:26.930]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.230 --> 02:59:32.175]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:32.175 --> 02:59:37.240]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:37.240 --> 02:59:41.404]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.404 --> 02:59:43.206]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:43.206 --> 02:59:47.810]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:52.372 --> 02:59:55.957]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.957 --> 02:59:59.181]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.011 --> 03:00:22.281]  Mark Stepnowski, two-time Super Bowl champ, and of course five-time pro bowler, but what he's really known for in my book is having a lot of courage.
[03:00:22.281 --> 03:00:27.206]  Just as an aside, we have been contacted over the last five, six years by countless
[03:00:28.308 --> 03:00:31.271]  Former and current NFL stars.
[03:00:31.271 --> 03:00:32.913]  Mainly NFL for some reason.
[03:00:32.913 --> 03:00:34.775]  A few basketball players.
[03:00:34.775 --> 03:00:36.336]  And they always want to talk to me off air.
[03:00:36.336 --> 03:00:37.657]  And I'm a busy guy.
[03:00:37.657 --> 03:00:40.180]  I'm not a hot shot or big shot, but I'm busy.
[03:00:40.180 --> 03:00:45.665]  But I've called a few and they just want to thank me and buy a bunch of videos and, you know, sometimes donate.
[03:00:45.665 --> 03:00:46.246]  But they're scared.
[03:00:47.227 --> 03:00:47.407]  I don't
[03:01:06.379 --> 03:01:08.601]  If they don't stand up against this evil.
[03:01:08.601 --> 03:01:11.803]  If this evil isn't confronted, it's going to grow and grow and grow like cancer.
[03:01:11.803 --> 03:01:15.305]  We did find the phone number, and that brings up another issue.
[03:01:15.305 --> 03:01:31.414]  Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth is helping the operation out of New York with the PayPal and the website building and the infrastructure, and 5% of the donations go to them to fund the infrastructure, 5% to first responders.
[03:01:34.156 --> 03:01:35.997]  Well I'd just like to say thanks for having us on.
[03:01:35.997 --> 03:01:38.178]  I appreciate the time to talk about this and obviously
[03:02:03.271 --> 03:02:08.140]  Anyone who's listening, you know, I would urge them to vote with their pocketbook.
[03:02:08.140 --> 03:02:10.024]  That's one thing you can do nowadays.
[03:02:11.303 --> 03:02:16.446]  Your vote might not count for much as far as the Democratic or the Republican Party.
[03:02:16.446 --> 03:02:34.295]  Your vote might not count much if it's made on a computer, but if you want to feel like you can actually make a difference, then vote with your pocketbook and try to help get these ads put on TV so that more people can become educated and we can create further awareness about what really happened on September 11, 2001.
[03:02:37.304 --> 03:02:38.024]  That's a good question.
[03:02:38.024 --> 03:02:40.826]  I honestly don't know if I can give you a good answer.
[03:02:40.826 --> 03:02:41.806]  I'm glad to hear it.
[03:02:41.806 --> 03:02:47.730]  It's nice to know that other guys in my former profession may feel the same way I do.
[03:03:00.524 --> 03:03:05.868]  It's hard to really say why that is, but I'm thankful that that is the case.
[03:03:05.868 --> 03:03:07.609]  Yeah, I just wish they'd go public.
[03:03:07.609 --> 03:03:11.091]  I mean, it's one thing to say, hey, I appreciate what you're doing.
[03:03:11.091 --> 03:03:12.212]  I know the truth.
[03:03:12.212 --> 03:03:14.674]  Maybe NFL guys have contacted me because of you.
[03:03:14.674 --> 03:03:16.655]  I bet you've kind of led the way in that.
[03:03:16.655 --> 03:03:18.516]  I'm kind of answering my own question.
[03:03:18.516 --> 03:03:20.298]  By the way, we did find the number.
[03:03:20.298 --> 03:03:22.459]  It's to Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[03:03:22.459 --> 03:03:24.540]  If you want to donate by phone, it's 510.
[03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:28.063]  And I'm reading this from 10 feet away, guys, so make sure I'm saying this right.
[03:03:30.525 --> 03:03:32.987]  292-4710, 510-292-4710.
[03:03:32.987 --> 03:03:37.750]  I got a big screen TV across the room.
[03:03:37.750 --> 03:03:42.634]  They put websites up and I'm staring across the hall here.
[03:03:42.634 --> 03:03:45.216]  But I just want to thank you both for coming on.
[03:03:45.216 --> 03:03:54.764]  We're basically out of time to get into more engineering, but you guys have agreed to come back on together and say, you know, two, three months to look at phase three of what's going on.
[03:03:54.764 --> 03:03:56.806]  We've seen phase one, big victory.
[03:03:56.806 --> 03:03:57.947]  Now we're into the second quarter.
[03:03:58.587 --> 03:04:01.148]  I just like to thank Mark for his articulateness and I'm very impressed.
[03:04:01.148 --> 03:04:03.189]  I appreciate you speaking out from your position, Mark.
[03:04:03.189 --> 03:04:05.551]  Thanks for being on the show with me today.
[03:04:05.551 --> 03:04:06.571]  I wouldn't miss it for the world.
[03:04:25.407 --> 03:04:29.169]  Well, it's like Mark said, the truth will come out in the end.
[03:04:29.169 --> 03:04:36.473]  It was Victor Hugo that said if you try to bury the truth, it will explode with such force later, you know, to totally destroy the liars.
[03:04:36.473 --> 03:04:39.555]  And no army can stop an idea whose time has come, as Victor Hugo said.
[03:04:39.555 --> 03:04:42.636]  Let me say bye to you both here during the break, gentlemen.
[03:04:42.636 --> 03:04:45.158]  I salute you and appreciate everybody, especially the listeners.
[03:04:45.638 --> 03:04:50.561]  You have made buildingwhat.org TV ad campaign such a huge success.
[03:04:50.561 --> 03:04:57.426]  Geraldo Rivera coming out for 9-11 truth because of it and no doubt Judge Knapp said the whole thing's a complete fraud.
[03:04:57.426 --> 03:04:59.807]  We salute those men of courage as well.
[03:04:59.807 --> 03:05:01.548]  Retransmissions coming up after the break.
[03:05:01.548 --> 03:05:01.929]  Stay with us.
