[01:16.040 --> 01:21.360]  going to release the original blueprint with the signatures the actual birth
[01:21.360 --> 01:25.200]  certificate and we've seen this flip-flop from Chris Matthews and others who said
[01:25.200 --> 01:28.680]  you know they've released the birth certificate this is the birth certificate
[01:28.680 --> 01:33.440]  now they admit oh you actually couldn't get in the CIA with a receipt of birth
[01:33.440 --> 01:39.120]  certificate you have to show your blueprint you have to show the original
[01:39.120 --> 01:45.920]  with the signatures so this is a big deal and have they manufactured one or
[01:45.920 --> 01:49.960]  will it is it a bluff are they going to really release it why didn't they do
[01:49.960 --> 01:54.800]  this two years ago and people for over two years have been demanding it and if

[09:06.040 --> 09:11.840]  okay let me just do this I always try to do it and then I don't but let me just
[09:11.840 --> 09:15.600]  read to you some of the headlines I've got here that are up on info wars.com
[09:15.600 --> 09:23.480]  and prisonplanet.com right now on this live 29th day of December 2010 it's
[09:23.480 --> 09:30.080]  about to be 2011 it'll be 2012 the 2013 and our lives go by like the twinkling
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.800]  of an eye this happened over the holidays when I was out of town and I've
[09:35.800 --> 09:39.600]  mentioned this before because it's actually come out before that when we
[09:39.600 --> 09:46.800]  get all these internal FBI Homeland Security reports I mean the latest few
[09:46.800 --> 09:50.360]  months ago was in Pennsylvania they didn't just have Homeland Security they
[09:50.360 --> 09:56.840]  had Israelis spying on the legislature wiretapping you name it they had the US
[09:56.840 --> 10:01.920]  Army involved I mean again this is a criminal government they're spying on
[10:01.920 --> 10:05.680]  the Congress they're spying on the legislature it's not the government the
[10:05.680 --> 10:10.280]  government is the legislature the government is the Congress the illegitimate
[10:10.280 --> 10:17.440]  rogue bureaucracy that works for the offshore banks is the enemy why do you
[10:17.440 --> 10:21.760]  think these different agencies going back more than 60 years every time you
[10:21.760 --> 10:26.440]  turn around get caught running secret torture centers secret biological
[10:26.440 --> 10:30.680]  chemical radiological testing centers it's not about testing the chemicals
[10:30.680 --> 10:35.040]  biological radiologicals they can test those on guinea pigs and get the exact
[10:35.040 --> 10:41.080]  same ratio okay that kills a rat or a guinea pig or a rabbit or a dog or a pig
[10:41.080 --> 10:47.560]  it's gonna kill a human it works the exact same way plus it's immoral that's
[10:47.560 --> 10:53.680]  a side issue they have created armies of cadres of people that will put a baby
[10:53.680 --> 10:58.440]  in a radiation chamber and murder them that will fly over our troops during a
[10:58.440 --> 11:04.800]  drill and nerve gas them and then they practice how to cover it up I said I get
[11:04.800 --> 11:08.000]  into the news it's just this morning I was jogging and it just really hit me
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.440]  again just how evil these people are and how much danger we're all in if we
[11:14.440 --> 11:17.960]  don't resist them because they're trying to totally take over every facet of
[11:17.960 --> 11:26.680]  society I was sent more internal FBI manuals and internal fear mongering
[11:26.680 --> 11:30.080]  propaganda that they give local businesses they're going to the gun
[11:30.080 --> 11:33.520]  shops they're going to the tattoo parlors the haircutting places the
[11:33.520 --> 11:39.680]  walmarts the farmer supply facilities of I've got it right here communities
[11:39.680 --> 11:45.240]  against terrorism potential indicators of terrorist activity and it says what
[11:45.240 --> 11:48.600]  should I consider suspicious first thing new customer who is not from local
[11:48.600 --> 11:54.360]  area and it goes on from there and the first thing the FBI people say when
[11:54.360 --> 11:58.000]  they come in and talk to the different businesses do you want to stop a new
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.720]  Oklahoma City well you're gonna be our little agent now our little our little
[12:02.720 --> 12:06.840]  informant and then the next meeting it's do you know about gun owners do you know
[12:06.840 --> 12:10.120]  about people criticizing the government in your area I mean I have this
[12:10.120 --> 12:14.120]  confirmed literally hundreds of times and we have their internal documents the
[12:14.120 --> 12:19.280]  my act the Homeland Security list goes on and on so again they tell you oh we're
[12:19.280 --> 12:23.160]  here to stop Al Qaeda then it's oh we're here to stop ten McVay and then it's oh
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.400]  we're here to stop the Ron Paul people we're here to stop the folks that want
[12:27.400 --> 12:30.440]  us out of the UN we're here to stop the people that want to cut the size of
[12:30.440 --> 12:33.680]  the government what was in the Pennsylvania information that got leaked
[12:33.680 --> 12:38.480]  out and they had a Homeland Security in that state to step down but it was all
[12:38.480 --> 12:44.800]  under federal auspices it was all under federal directives it was in the
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.800]  manuals that that that we published in in the internal reports that that we
[12:49.800 --> 12:54.040]  published in local newspapers in Pennsylvania published it said right
[12:54.040 --> 12:58.080]  there they're protesting and these members of the legislature are
[12:58.080 --> 13:03.520]  protesting higher taxes and that threatens the infrastructure of the
[13:03.520 --> 13:07.560]  government I mean they actually sit there in FBI and Homeland Security
[13:07.560 --> 13:13.000]  meetings and say these states want to get cut government that'll cut our pay
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.440]  that'll cut our positions that's a threat to government see it's it's
[13:16.440 --> 13:23.720]  government now against the people and so wiretap these people in the
[13:23.720 --> 13:29.920]  legislature follow them this member of the legislature is running a pro gun
[13:29.920 --> 13:34.600]  group he's a potential terrorist and then they couldn't get the state police to
[13:34.600 --> 13:38.320]  spy on the members of the legislature so they brought his railies in and it's
[13:38.320 --> 13:44.200]  all on record it's all illegal and nobody goes to jail what came out four or
[13:44.200 --> 13:48.160]  five years ago that mi6 and mi5 spy on every member of the parliament in
[13:48.160 --> 13:53.560]  England the parliament is the supposed government what is the rogue police
[13:53.560 --> 13:59.400]  agencies doing that's what happened in Nazi Germany that's who Hitler went out
[13:59.400 --> 14:03.160]  and recruited he went out and recruited the cops the law enforcement the military
[14:03.160 --> 14:06.880]  people and then a bunch of street thugs and criminals to back them up what was
[14:06.880 --> 14:10.120]  in the news two days ago all over the country the army and National Guard is
[14:10.120 --> 14:15.760]  recruiting felons out of prisons as their backup they introduce it to the
[14:15.760 --> 14:19.760]  public that oh it's for disasters when you read the fine print and civil unrest
[14:19.760 --> 14:24.720]  what it's Stalin do he opened up the prisons who did they use to enforce on
[14:24.720 --> 14:29.400]  the police and the military if they didn't follow orders hardcore brigades of
[14:29.400 --> 14:38.560]  hardened murderers who brought Hitler to power the SA you look up the statistics
[14:38.560 --> 14:45.100]  more than half of them were hardcore criminals now the hardcore criminals
[14:45.100 --> 14:48.920]  he to know that after the full tyranny's brought in you're gonna be put in
[14:48.920 --> 14:55.400]  prison or killed it's done everywhere show via Union communist China Fidel
[14:55.400 --> 15:02.000]  Castro a pole pot Hitler you need to know this I mean they're following an
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.880]  exact blueprint we've seen repeated over and over again Julia Caesar used the
[15:06.880 --> 15:15.560]  mob he used criminals has his main enforcers in Rome this is not new we
[15:15.560 --> 15:19.280]  know exactly the case of tyranny we've got and it's a nasty one it's the
[15:19.280 --> 15:23.240]  nastiest I've ever studied and we're watching it live time unfold and it is
[15:23.240 --> 15:27.560]  bad so you know you might want to call the FBI as we've done live on air and
[15:27.560 --> 15:30.280]  tell them if they want to investigate Oklahoma City I mean we have their own
[15:30.280 --> 15:35.320]  internal FBI memos that have been gotten through four-year lawsuits and in one
[15:35.320 --> 15:38.480]  lawsuit they blacked out part and other lawsuit years later they blacked out the
[15:38.480 --> 15:42.520]  other so the lawyers were able to put both together and the feds and Southern
[15:42.520 --> 15:47.760]  Poverty Law Center were running the op out of Elohim City as police officers
[15:47.760 --> 15:50.440]  told us but of course they were murdered shortly after Terrence Yaki
[15:50.440 --> 15:54.400]  Cobb of the year and others they tortured him something fierce but I guess
[15:54.400 --> 16:02.960]  it's terrorism to expose the ATF bomb in that building but continuing ATF even
[16:02.960 --> 16:06.480]  tested blowing up a rider truck a few months before that's on record but nothing
[16:06.480 --> 16:13.560]  suspicious they've been tested it out in the desert on record I mean they think
[16:13.560 --> 16:16.920]  you're so stupid and they think the rest of you that are awake are gonna be
[16:16.920 --> 16:19.760]  cowards and go well it's true but I'm not gonna speak out against them they
[16:19.760 --> 16:24.080]  might get me they've already got us all we can do is stand up against this crew
[16:24.080 --> 16:27.640]  of murderers so FBI you're running all over getting everybody ready for the
[16:27.640 --> 16:32.080]  White Al Qaeda telling them Tim McVeigh is about to hit that means your bosses
[16:32.080 --> 16:37.240]  are about to hit maybe some Brits or or Israelis you're gonna hire or Germans
[16:37.240 --> 16:42.000]  we know we've used all those groups we know our government has done that but
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.360]  it's not our government so I just thought I'd mention this story that we
[16:46.360 --> 16:49.720]  never got to last week I mean it was on in full wars and prison planet but I
[16:49.720 --> 16:53.760]  didn't I want to hear Florida Fusion Center surveilled Ron Paul's campaign
[16:53.760 --> 16:58.520]  for Liberty well good folks inside the army leaked us over almost two years
[16:58.520 --> 17:06.800]  ago that in late 2008 on in the Fed day in Texas our group up in Dallas and
[17:06.800 --> 17:11.640]  Ron Paul in Houston the army was there in plain clothes and it said do not let
[17:11.640 --> 17:15.160]  him know your army they may kill you their terrorist Ron Paul may just pull
[17:15.160 --> 17:19.280]  out six shooters and just start blasting I mean I mean they do it with a
[17:19.280 --> 17:23.800]  straight face okay because Ron Paul knows who the enemy is and Alex Jones
[17:23.800 --> 17:29.600]  knows who's the enemy so every few years when I'm in a target parking lot or in
[17:29.600 --> 17:33.760]  a dark parking lot at night they like to have army guys and you know when suits
[17:33.760 --> 17:38.920]  come up and get around me and tell me I better watch myself it's all just letting
[17:38.920 --> 17:43.880]  me know just letting me know I'm not in a free country so they can ship in their
[17:43.880 --> 17:47.560]  narcotics and kidnap little kids all over the world and have black sites where
[17:47.560 --> 17:51.800]  they torture people because they like it they build a world so they can have
[17:51.800 --> 17:55.440]  their party the average good well-meaning person that joins the
[17:55.440 --> 17:59.600]  military is compartmentalized has no idea this is going on but it's in the
[17:59.600 --> 18:03.960]  hundreds now of army Marine Corps Navy investigators that do do their job with
[18:03.960 --> 18:08.800]  corruption all over the world and they always get killed how many people got
[18:08.800 --> 18:13.800]  to get killed here you see and by the way they're not gonna be satisfied with
[18:13.800 --> 18:18.280]  all the power and raping and corruption they want more that's why they're out in
[18:18.280 --> 18:22.240]  the open going yeah we got black sites yeah we torture people White House puts
[18:22.240 --> 18:25.800]  out memos saying you can bury people alive you can torture their children
[18:25.800 --> 18:28.840]  in front of them and then the army report comes out and they admit that
[18:28.840 --> 18:34.360]  that's what's going on they because they like it they like it you figure that
[18:34.360 --> 18:39.560]  out yet they like it and smart murderers and psychos they don't go around just
[18:39.560 --> 18:44.520]  grabbing women off the side of the street in their yellow Volkswagen they go
[18:44.520 --> 18:51.760]  and they get into power and that's basic criminology they're called highly
[18:51.760 --> 19:00.520]  intelligent high operation level psychopaths highly functioning psychopaths
[19:00.520 --> 19:05.280]  is the actual term and they run the world and they're building a giant
[19:05.280 --> 19:10.000]  torture center just a giant Disney world for themselves and it's their
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.240]  Valhalla it's their heaven and every time a Hitler or Stalin gets to build their
[19:14.240 --> 19:20.560]  Disneyland it's just mass death black uniforms raping people being stomped to
[19:20.560 --> 19:25.120]  death burning cities just and then it runs like a disease and burns itself out
[19:25.120 --> 19:28.600]  but the globalist called the final revolution all their white papers they
[19:28.600 --> 19:31.720]  say we're not gonna let that happen with our high tech system we're gonna
[19:31.720 --> 19:38.160]  manage it all and it's gonna get even better I mean they just can't wait to
[19:38.160 --> 19:41.240]  rape your wife and blow your children's heads off and torture your children in
[19:41.240 --> 19:44.960]  front of you they love it and they that's why it came out mainstream news

[24:23.600 --> 24:27.960]  criminals are that have taken over the unelected bureaucracy with that we've
[24:27.960 --> 24:34.920]  got links to mainstream news articles to the Orlando Sentinel to all these
[24:34.920 --> 24:38.640]  reports in Curtin M. O.'s article from last week Florida Fusion Center
[24:38.640 --> 24:43.280]  surveilled Ron Paul's campaign for Liberty they didn't just list them if you
[24:43.280 --> 24:48.880]  got an American flag on your car get us out of the UN sticker on your car or if
[24:48.880 --> 24:53.960]  you're flying the Gadsden flag or you like Bob Barr Ron Paul I mean these are
[24:53.960 --> 24:59.720]  outstanding respected people that you may be a terrorist now they're going in
[24:59.720 --> 25:04.880]  they're surveilling public intelligence and international consortium of
[25:04.880 --> 25:08.280]  independent researchers reports at a fusion center in Florida snooped on
[25:08.280 --> 25:13.600]  Ron Paul supporters and other political groups see and that's not been admitted
[25:13.600 --> 25:19.800]  the last year by the Poletano and others over 95% of their operations are
[25:19.800 --> 25:24.680]  against real Americans I mean if you're really what this country was founded on
[25:24.680 --> 25:28.880]  if you are a good decent person that doesn't want foreign banks robbing us
[25:28.880 --> 25:32.600]  and doesn't want to lose your liberty and don't want the dollar destroyed you're
[25:32.600 --> 25:39.800]  the enemy haven't people gotten this yet the government is bad and it's not
[25:39.800 --> 25:42.520]  gonna get fixed just with some Republicans up there in Congress now if
[25:42.520 --> 25:45.840]  you take over all the state houses through the legislative system which is
[25:45.840 --> 25:50.480]  what they're really worried about that's who they're surveilling trying to get
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.240]  dirt to feed out local cops and the threat fusion centers to set you up but
[25:56.240 --> 25:59.560]  we've got to be we've got to have courage we've got to be bold but I've
[25:59.560 --> 26:03.960]  said many times it's not really courage for people that aren't informed they
[26:03.960 --> 26:07.720]  have to have courage to stand up but when you know that these people are
[26:07.720 --> 26:14.240]  basically trying to set something up worse than Stalin and Hitler then I
[26:14.240 --> 26:20.240]  mean there's nothing you can do I mean you think somebody's happy when they go
[26:20.240 --> 26:22.960]  open up their business at 7 a.m. in the morning there's people in there
[26:22.960 --> 26:26.200]  robbing it and they've got to go out to their car get their gun and go in and
[26:26.200 --> 26:31.080]  shoot them no it's just got to be done and it's the same thing here in the
[26:31.080 --> 26:36.560]  info war you think I'm happy this is going on I've got to risk my life no but
[26:36.560 --> 26:40.240]  it's got to be done they're there they're doing it we know they're crooks we
[26:40.240 --> 26:44.640]  know they're sick I mean these are really sick this isn't look if this was
[26:44.640 --> 26:48.280]  just boss hog corruption I would know that it would take decades to lead to
[26:48.280 --> 26:53.400]  something worse and I wouldn't be as worried I'd be speaking out against it
[26:53.400 --> 26:59.720]  this is not boss hog corruption this is not sure of Pico train or whatever his
[26:59.720 --> 27:04.560]  name is Roscoe Pico train you know writing tickets to folks that don't
[27:04.560 --> 27:07.640]  deserve it making a little extra money being corrupt that's bad and that's
[27:07.640 --> 27:14.080]  wrong this is really nasty devilish stuff this is wicked upon wicked this is
[27:14.080 --> 27:20.540]  quadruple wicked it's so wicked I can't even believe they're this wicked but you
[27:20.540 --> 27:25.800]  notice they're operating out in the open now telling you secret arrest and
[27:25.800 --> 27:28.840]  tortures good admitting they're surveilling all of us without warrants
[27:28.840 --> 27:39.280]  and it's illegal Florida Fusion Center surveilled Ron Paul's campaign for
[27:39.280 --> 27:47.320]  liberty the events span the spectrum they got this their foyer request from a
[27:47.320 --> 27:51.760]  summit hosted by Ron Paul's campaign for liberty to anti-war protests conducted
[27:51.760 --> 27:56.280]  by code pink and veterans for peace while the documents make no mention of
[27:56.280 --> 27:59.920]  specific threats arising from the events they do indicate that the Fusion
[27:59.920 --> 28:03.600]  Center monitors political activity in a variety of forms and sometimes request
[28:03.600 --> 28:09.840]  law enforcement officers to report on constitutionally protected activities and
[28:09.840 --> 28:13.680]  it goes on to how the central Florida intelligence exchange was established
[28:13.680 --> 28:17.360]  with an $850,000 Department of Homeland Security grant then they build them in
[28:17.360 --> 28:21.440]  all your local towns with more money here's another one by Curtin MO the day
[28:21.440 --> 28:27.760]  after this last story from last week on December 24th Tennessee Fusion Center

[28:35.440 --> 28:39.320]  like them promote an abortion I may not like the fact that they won't defend
[28:39.320 --> 28:44.120]  the Second Amendment they're certainly progressive socialist types but the ACLU
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.160]  are not terrorist in fact they've got some good branches and some good members
[28:48.160 --> 28:54.640]  and some good work is done by them and the ACLU is what we make it and the
[28:54.640 --> 28:58.280]  ACLU has fought the Patriot Act and all the rest of it and they're standing up
[28:58.280 --> 29:05.560]  against the airport grope downs well what happens to them on Thursday we
[29:05.560 --> 29:09.080]  reported on a Florida Fusion Center snooping on Ron Paul and campaign for

[32:59.680 --> 33:05.360]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center and the heart of the
[33:05.360 --> 33:11.640]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show before I go to attorney
[33:11.640 --> 33:16.800]  Phil Berg and a doctor of history Webster Griffin Tarbley expert on Barack
[33:16.800 --> 33:21.720]  Shane Obama real name Barry Sitaro with big developments on the birth certificate
[33:21.720 --> 33:26.000]  issue huge developments and before they leave us we'll play part of a Chris
[33:26.000 --> 33:33.680]  Matthews clip from just yesterday I was covering Tennessee Fusion Center puts
[33:33.680 --> 33:38.960]  ACLU on terror list and they put them on the list for telling schools to make
[33:38.960 --> 33:46.040]  the holiday season inclusive now that's political manipulation they know in the
[33:46.040 --> 33:51.680]  polls and I've seen national polls of above 75% outrage by banning Christmas
[33:51.680 --> 33:57.080]  banning red and green in schools that's going on so they do little politically
[33:57.080 --> 34:00.840]  correct things that are seen as politically correct by conservatives to
[34:00.840 --> 34:06.120]  make it look legitimate meanwhile they're spying on Ron Paul liberals they
[34:06.120 --> 34:11.880]  spy on everybody that's how this political correctness works so I just
[34:11.880 --> 34:15.400]  wanted to add that final point you know that sounds reasonable to conservatives
[34:15.400 --> 34:20.360]  yeah the ACLU are terrorists they want to restrict Christmas this is all part of
[34:20.360 --> 34:26.040]  a Psyop now and we've got Mike Adams coming up for 30 minutes in the next
[34:26.040 --> 34:32.520]  hour then Porter Stansbury on the fact of the dollar is moving towards losing
[34:32.520 --> 34:36.880]  its World Reserve currency status we've got former top Dallas Cowboy Lyman
[34:36.880 --> 34:42.800]  Mark Stepnowski and a engineer coming on to talk about new 9-11 truth
[34:42.800 --> 34:46.680]  developments and an operation they're launching so it'll be but that news will
[34:46.680 --> 34:56.920]  be broken here coming up in the last hour today in fact maybe I should play
[34:56.920 --> 35:01.320]  that Chris Matthews clip now we have that queued up I want to play a few
[35:01.320 --> 35:05.960]  minutes of this and and then we'll go to Tarbley and Berg together to get their
[35:05.960 --> 35:09.640]  take on what this signifies I've got my take I'm going to give it first here
[35:09.640 --> 35:17.440]  briefly but this is Chris Matthews recently talking about this new governor
[35:17.440 --> 35:23.040]  and now the governor Democrat Neil Abercrombie has vowed to release the
[35:23.040 --> 35:27.200]  birth certificate so that's the new development and the big change here is
[35:27.200 --> 35:31.120]  the full clips up on infowars.com and prison.com it's about eight minutes
[35:31.120 --> 35:36.040]  long we're supposed to play a minute or two several times Matthews says you could
[35:36.040 --> 35:40.840]  you get in the CIA with just a receipt of birth certificate they finally admitted
[35:40.840 --> 35:47.400]  that it's a receipt not the birth certificate not the blueprint not the
[35:47.400 --> 35:51.840]  photo stat not the one with the signatures and the and the feet print
[35:51.840 --> 35:59.440]  like all of us have it's a it's a receipt of it okay and you can't get in the
[35:59.440 --> 36:03.480]  FBI with one of those you can't get in the CIA with one of those you certainly
[36:03.480 --> 36:08.920]  can't be president with one of those and it's the Constitution now I don't know
[36:08.920 --> 36:13.640]  if he was really born in Kenya or not the evidence shows he was but I know he
[36:13.640 --> 36:16.880]  gave up a citizenship in Indonesia and became Barry Setara and then now there's
[36:16.880 --> 36:21.040]  another name we find out about so that right there under law means you can't be
[36:21.040 --> 36:23.480]  president but I'm about to go to both these men briefly for the rest of the
[36:23.480 --> 36:28.720]  hour but here is the clip of them basically panicking some polls show 60%
[36:28.720 --> 36:33.400]  some 50 the poll they sides only 20 something percent don't believe he's
[36:33.400 --> 36:38.760]  really an American or natural born so here they are going from stonewalling
[36:38.760 --> 36:43.160]  for over two years and saying you've got the birth certificate saying we're
[36:43.160 --> 36:47.640]  liars saying we're cooks saying the full birth certificate is very released to
[36:47.640 --> 36:51.960]  now saying release the stupid thing something we've always been saying this
[36:51.960 --> 36:56.360]  is a big deal here it is is this going to help if we get more documentation and
[36:56.360 --> 37:00.960]  second question why has the president himself not demanded that they put out
[37:00.960 --> 37:05.320]  the initial documents already present presence got more important things to
[37:05.320 --> 37:09.880]  do thank goodness he that he's more focused on that governor Abercrombie
[37:09.880 --> 37:14.520]  himself says that and points out that it is he the governor who's bringing this
[37:14.520 --> 37:22.560]  issue up you can make a phone call and write a letter and in about a month a
[37:22.560 --> 37:26.600]  copy of your original birth certificate comes I know because I lost mine once
[37:26.600 --> 37:32.160]  and had to get it okay and they don't take a receipt of a birth certificate to
[37:32.160 --> 37:37.240]  get a new passport or driver's license they want the original okay or to get in
[37:37.240 --> 37:42.400]  school they want the original so he was too busy to have one of his thousands
[37:42.400 --> 37:45.720]  of employees get it then this has been an issue even during the campaign huge
[37:45.720 --> 37:50.440]  issue he just has got more important things let's continue as he saw Obama as
[37:50.440 --> 37:56.360]  a baby and he is tired of people literally lambasting Obama's parents for
[37:56.360 --> 38:02.800]  no good reason and so he wants to try to put this to rest of course it won't
[38:02.800 --> 38:07.320]  work because the birthers aren't interested in evidence that Obama was
[38:07.320 --> 38:12.720]  born a US citizen they only want to hear evidence that he was not and that's
[38:12.720 --> 38:17.400]  not going to happen well what about going to that 20 percent or 23 percent we
[38:17.400 --> 38:21.120]  showed in the New York Times Paul that doesn't know they just want evidence is
[38:21.120 --> 38:24.480]  that a group that has a right to get more documentation and would rather
[38:24.480 --> 38:29.080]  crown these position here be the right one David well listen there's enough
[38:29.080 --> 38:32.520]  evidence out there already there's the certificate that you're holding up but
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.680]  perhaps even more importantly there are two birth announcements in Honolulu
[38:36.680 --> 38:41.360]  newspapers imagine the conspiratorial mind that would have to at the time of
[38:41.360 --> 38:46.200]  his birth it was in 1961 plant plant those things so that one day he could
[38:46.200 --> 38:50.280]  become president of the United States so there's already plentiful nation out
[38:50.280 --> 38:55.880]  there the not become president of the US this is routine get the kid back in the
[38:55.880 --> 39:00.240]  country falsify that he was born here so he could be a natural born and get all
[39:00.240 --> 39:04.440]  those benefits and more than half the family are on record being CIA and big
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.760]  Foundation operatives and then finally I'm not gonna play the whole clip because
[39:08.760 --> 39:11.400]  we're running out of time here but Matthews goes on and says well you
[39:11.400 --> 39:17.040]  couldn't get in the CIA with with this receipt you know and he holds up a copy
[39:17.040 --> 39:22.480]  of his that is the photo stat and says we need to see this so I want to bring
[39:22.480 --> 39:28.840]  up Phil Berg and Webster Tarpley Phil Berg going back two and a half years he
[39:28.840 --> 39:32.720]  was the first to really question things Tarpley looked into it began
[39:32.720 --> 39:37.080]  questioning and has written books on the subject and this whole thing is very
[39:37.080 --> 39:41.200]  very suspicious but but briefly from both of you a two-minute statement from
[39:41.200 --> 39:46.480]  you Phil Berg attorney-at-law on what you think this signifies that a two-minute
[39:46.480 --> 39:49.720]  statement from Tarpley on this then I've got other questions
[39:49.720 --> 39:56.640]  sure thanks Phil Berg I appreciate it I found my first lawsuit August 21st 2008
[39:56.640 --> 40:01.080]  before he was even nominated to the Democratic National Committee and I
[40:01.080 --> 40:05.800]  sued Obama and the Democratic National Committee but they were a co-worked
[40:05.800 --> 40:10.600]  together I think the significance of this first off I agree with you the birth
[40:10.600 --> 40:15.360]  certificate issue is really not the issue because he was adopted in Indonesia
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.960]  and whatever citizenship he had and I think he lost at that time he could have
[40:19.960 --> 40:24.280]  renewed it between the ages of 18 and 21 there's no evidence he ever did there's
[40:24.280 --> 40:28.160]  no evidence he ever changed his name I believe his legal name was Barry so
[40:28.160 --> 40:33.000]  Toro where you can use an alias you can use an alias but not for fraudulent
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.320]  purposes and that's what he's doing that's why everything's so sealed right
[40:37.320 --> 40:41.640]  and I think the significance with Chris Matthews saying it I think he's falling
[40:41.640 --> 40:47.040]  into a trap which is wonderful I think abracame really believes that Obama was
[40:47.040 --> 40:51.360]  born in Hawaii and he wants records released and he's got a rude awakening
[40:51.360 --> 40:57.120]  you don't see Obama just saying okay I'll release it because up until one
[40:57.120 --> 41:01.080]  point they only set out there we looked at his vital record they never said we
[41:01.080 --> 41:05.520]  looked at his birth certificate and I think the significance of that is that I
[41:05.520 --> 41:09.200]  think they have the Kenya birth certificate locked up there in Hawaii
[41:09.200 --> 41:16.360]  which they perhaps did when they got a short form or the document the like
[41:16.360 --> 41:22.760]  the document they produced it's outrageous but but I think now it's
[41:22.760 --> 41:25.400]  coming our way more and more people are coming our way
[41:25.400 --> 41:30.640]  Obama dropping in the polls his real name is Toro I have one case
[41:30.640 --> 41:34.600]  significant still going we just need to raise the money for it to the US Supreme
[41:34.600 --> 41:38.960]  Court well we have the school records that it's a tarot and and you were
[41:38.960 --> 41:42.480]  laughed at two years ago about that now it's all over the news they've been
[41:42.480 --> 41:47.120]  trying to psychologically inoculate people to this now just a year ago we
[41:47.120 --> 41:53.400]  were coax now it's always name is Barry Sotaro he did worship at the Muslim
[41:53.400 --> 41:58.400]  mosque his mother didn't like it but he he said I'm a Muslim you know that's and
[41:58.400 --> 42:01.440]  I'm not saying it's bad that he's a Muslim the point is he lied about it now
[42:01.440 --> 42:05.200]  all of that's coming out in the newspapers but they're spending it like
[42:05.200 --> 42:10.160]  it's cute and sweet let's get Tarpoli's take on that well thank you Alex I think
[42:10.160 --> 42:14.960]  the big issue in behind all of this is the blackmail of Obama that whatever you
[42:14.960 --> 42:19.600]  think about this one way or the other it's clear that he is blackmailed that
[42:19.600 --> 42:23.600]  he cannot produce a birth certificate for whatever they won't release high
[42:23.600 --> 42:28.320]  school college they seal it all that like it's quite right but but especially on
[42:28.320 --> 42:32.960]  this this constitutional issue of the natural born citizen it seems to me
[42:32.960 --> 42:37.760]  that there's a cartel foreign foreign intelligence agencies you can just go
[42:37.760 --> 42:42.840]  through a list of countries maybe groups in the Pentagon certainly groups in
[42:42.840 --> 42:47.720]  Wall Street are blackmailing Obama the kingdom come and then there's a very
[42:47.720 --> 42:51.800]  significant vested interest in this if you look at them you know the Rupert
[42:51.800 --> 42:55.960]  Murdoch news media they don't seem to be that interested in the birth certificate
[42:55.960 --> 42:59.840]  issue I think the main reason is that Rupert Murdoch and his co-lords are
[42:59.840 --> 43:04.880]  blackmailing Obama to a fair be well look at this tax monstrosity that just went
[43:04.880 --> 43:10.840]  through tax cuts for the rich tax cuts for Paris Hilton as as Mitch McConnell the
[43:10.840 --> 43:16.000]  Republicans said when they had bush and control of two houses of Congress the
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.280]  Republicans could not get the deal on the estate tax that they just got from
[43:20.280 --> 43:25.560]  Obama with a Democratic majority you know I disagree with your big government
[43:25.560 --> 43:30.680]  views but I want to talk about this issue Obama betraying his own base no I
[43:30.680 --> 43:34.720]  understand that the guy was by Wall Street what do you expect but it's a
[43:34.720 --> 43:39.640]  better deal it's a better deal than the Republicans got even under Bush so this
[43:39.640 --> 43:44.240]  this I think indicates the dimensions of blackmail right endless war in
[43:44.240 --> 43:49.040]  Afghanistan these sellouts on the home front all calculated to enrage his
[43:49.040 --> 43:53.640]  Democratic base now the other side is the Republicans are coming to town all
[43:53.640 --> 43:57.960]  right here in Washington are on Darrell Issa Darrell Issa is going to be the
[43:57.960 --> 44:03.280]  head of the House of government operations committee and it normally
[44:03.280 --> 44:07.160]  would be up to Darrell Issa to step up and say I'm the Congressman from
[44:07.160 --> 44:11.120]  California I'm the head of this new committee here and I just want to see
[44:11.120 --> 44:16.440]  Obama's birth certificate so that may be going on behind the scenes the other
[44:16.440 --> 44:22.080]  thing of course is the Clintons it may indeed be that there are moves inside the
[44:22.080 --> 44:26.880]  Democratic Party to dump Obama he is a disaster and from their part of you and
[44:26.880 --> 44:31.800]  to some degree from mine what you have with Obama is going to be a series of
[44:31.800 --> 44:37.640]  betrayals and sellouts and capitulations as long as he's in office it's going to
[44:37.640 --> 44:41.640]  be an absolute disaster from the point of view of people in the Democratic Party
[44:41.640 --> 44:46.880]  Obama ran on saying I'm not Bush and now with his tax bill he says I am Bush
[44:46.880 --> 44:51.360]  surprise I really am Bush so this is this is political suicide but Webster
[44:51.360 --> 44:54.840]  let me go back here and have you finish up your comment and then go back to
[44:54.840 --> 45:00.080]  Berg and then we'll come back to you my question for you is and I didn't have
[45:00.080 --> 45:04.360]  time to play the whole clip what does it signify to have them change course in
[45:04.360 --> 45:09.720]  the middle of the stream and go from stonewalling and and calling this this
[45:09.720 --> 45:16.000]  this receipt of a certificate a certificate and now admitting that we
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.440]  haven't seen his real birth certificate it is a test I think it and a test it
[45:21.440 --> 45:25.420]  says that we have on deposit someplace else this is not the document is the
[45:25.420 --> 45:30.880]  idea behind it well two two things one is it could be the Clinton machine or
[45:30.880 --> 45:35.760]  some other Democratic machine that is beginning to soften him up beginning to
[45:35.760 --> 45:39.320]  encourage somebody to come forward to challenge him in the Democratic primaries
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.600]  which is I think absolutely essential for the for the political health of the
[45:43.600 --> 45:49.040]  country from from many points of view and or it can be the people who own
[45:49.040 --> 45:53.680]  Matthews now this would be in health of general electric right who owns that
[45:53.680 --> 45:58.160]  network email to maybe saying well the Republicans are coming in I want to
[45:58.160 --> 46:02.240]  cover my bets I want to also take control of the issue a little bit
[46:02.240 --> 46:06.560]  partly I mean you predicted this a year ago or more that they throw him under
[46:06.560 --> 46:10.880]  the bus going into the 2012 election we've seen Washington Post editorial
[46:10.880 --> 46:15.240]  pages calling for him to step down in the last month this is really happening
[46:15.240 --> 46:20.280]  let's get attorney Phil Berg's take on this no I think you really see a change
[46:20.280 --> 46:26.120]  and and I think it's significant I think there's a perhaps your right on the
[46:26.120 --> 46:30.400]  Clinton thing because his word that she's gonna step down as secretary of
[46:30.400 --> 46:35.320]  state and that could be setting up for her to run for president to get out of
[46:35.320 --> 46:39.760]  the administration right now but the big thing is there's so many people in this
[46:39.760 --> 46:44.440]  country that agree with us that Obama is a fraud a phony this the biggest hoax
[46:44.440 --> 46:49.000]  against the United States of America in our history he's an imposter and think
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.040]  about it when he first took office he insisted on having his blackberry which
[46:53.040 --> 46:58.920]  you see on his belt as he's walking around because as Webster stated he I
[46:58.920 --> 47:02.720]  believe he's being blackmailed by the powers of being this country the
[47:02.720 --> 47:07.320]  powers that they are money people and he's told what to do with speeches most
[47:07.320 --> 47:11.360]  of his speeches are off the telephone they're the written by someone else he
[47:11.360 --> 47:15.000]  delivers a good speech when he's on a teleprompter other than that he doesn't
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.840]  so I think I think I agree with Webster at this point they might be ready to get
[47:19.840 --> 47:24.960]  rid of them at this point and that will help us but I like I stood there from
[47:24.960 --> 47:29.400]  the beginning and I really believe he's a fraud and a phony and the words I used
[47:29.400 --> 47:34.160]  you know if it was really false they'd be after me they'd be suing me but they
[47:34.160 --> 47:38.360]  haven't done that and we're on the right track and I just mentioned briefly it's
[47:38.360 --> 47:41.400]  real significant the case I have getting ready for the US Supreme Court
[47:41.400 --> 47:45.800]  because it was turned down I'm claiming that Obama is not only not natural born
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.080]  he's not naturalized and therefore his term as a US senator was fraud and
[47:50.080 --> 47:53.960]  therefore the salary and benefits of a million dollars to go back to US Treasury
[47:53.960 --> 47:58.160]  obviously if he couldn't be a US senator he can't be president everything he
[47:58.160 --> 48:02.440]  signed everything he signed is no one void and whether it's from the left
[48:02.440 --> 48:06.320]  perspective or the right perspective anyone who looks at that health care
[48:06.320 --> 48:11.520]  bill knows it was written by insurance companies it's a scam even if you're a
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.640]  socialist out there you know it's not what you were asking for we need to get
[48:15.640 --> 48:20.600]  rid of it and so tarpally is this not good news though if Obama is brought
[48:20.600 --> 48:24.280]  down because then so much of what he's done is discredited
[48:24.280 --> 48:30.200]  certainly to get Obama out now would be a public service to have this issue come
[48:30.200 --> 48:35.520]  to the fore finally to have to have Phil Berg's work of many years now put back
[48:35.520 --> 48:39.760]  in the public spotlight because otherwise it could be a disaster from
[48:39.760 --> 48:43.280]  every point of view and again if you're if you are blackmailed in this way you
[48:43.280 --> 48:47.320]  can't be president you can't carry out the constitutional office if you're
[48:47.320 --> 48:51.680]  constantly blackmailed by virtually every secret intelligence agency in the
[48:51.680 --> 48:56.480]  world Wall Street and God knows what other what other cliques are doing this
[48:56.480 --> 49:01.680]  so unfortunately it's a painful process but I'm afraid huh this is the
[49:01.680 --> 49:06.640]  situation we're now in and the the path of what can we say least damage to the
[49:06.640 --> 49:10.720]  country in the Constitution is just for Obama to be removed from office and
[49:10.720 --> 49:16.720]  again I would like to see Darrell Issa if he's such a fire-breathing guarantor of
[49:16.720 --> 49:21.400]  the public interest how about a quick subpoena for a birth certificate let's
[49:21.400 --> 49:24.200]  get to the bottom of this that could be done next week
[49:24.200 --> 49:28.520]  Republicans take over next week so Darrell Issa where's this where's this
[49:28.520 --> 49:33.360]  appeal that's right if they don't move directly to demand the birth certificate
[49:33.360 --> 49:37.160]  which is you know just a fact-finding mission then we know they're wanting to
[49:37.160 --> 49:41.320]  hold this back there to continue the blackmailing exactly because it's a
[49:41.320 --> 49:44.320]  very lucrative thing and there they think that they're going to get a lot
[49:44.320 --> 49:49.640]  more things that they want over the next two years again the that tax bill is the
[49:49.640 --> 49:54.160]  first attack on social security in terms of the old-age pensions and I think
[49:54.160 --> 49:57.720]  there are there are people Peter Peterson and the Koch brothers and all
[49:57.720 --> 50:00.960]  sorts and they're selling it just like in New Jersey that this will fix the
[50:00.960 --> 50:04.240]  deficit if you don't get rid of the debt black hole the fractural reserve
[50:04.240 --> 50:07.480]  banking and the derivatives you could cut everything it's not going to pay
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.040]  anything off yeah the lesson of history is the more you cut the bigger the
[50:11.040 --> 50:15.960]  deficit is in the out years when you come back in the following year so this
[50:15.960 --> 50:22.240]  this makes no sense so nothing nothing but terrible tragedy with Obama so any
[50:22.240 --> 50:27.880]  hacked politician a normal hacked bureaucrat politician would be better
[50:27.880 --> 50:31.480]  than Obama and there's there's a broader race so let's let's get to the bottom of
[50:31.480 --> 50:35.720]  this fast and the heaters on the Republicans now they made big promises
[50:35.720 --> 50:39.440]  let's see what they're made of Darrell I start first we want them with the birth
[50:39.440 --> 50:43.000]  certificate in the public domain and then we want this other issue on the
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.200]  naturalization in Indonesia yeah and if the Republicans don't do that notice
[50:47.200 --> 50:51.520]  Glenn Beck had monashes his audience almost every day do not go after the birth
[50:51.520 --> 50:55.920]  certificate do not go after it because they want to keep using that card we
[50:55.920 --> 51:00.520]  want to play the card we'll be right back with Phil Berg and Webster Tarbley

[54:13.800 --> 54:19.760]  front porch sitting in an old house we're almost out of time with Webster
[54:19.760 --> 54:26.800]  Darpley and Phil Berg in closing gentlemen not what you want to happen but
[54:26.800 --> 54:31.200]  what do you and your gut see happening with Obama the lowest approval rating
[54:31.200 --> 54:36.480]  in history for a president at this point the fastest continual dropping in
[54:36.480 --> 54:41.280]  history I mean in another year or so this guy I can't seem with above a 20
[54:41.280 --> 54:48.320]  point approval rating I agree with you he's a puppet get him out of there so
[54:48.320 --> 54:51.800]  that we can you know you know actually engage the globalist instead of them
[54:51.800 --> 54:57.480]  just blaming everything on their minion in closing Phil Berg work how do you see
[54:57.480 --> 55:04.120]  this ending well I've been hopeful since 2008 I think we need these the word you
[55:04.120 --> 55:07.880]  do a terrific job on that we have to get more and more people found if they put
[55:07.880 --> 55:12.720]  pressure on the Republicans on Isaac to do it or we'll see that a Clinton and
[55:12.720 --> 55:16.440]  others are going to try to do a Clinton would have a lot of control and he could
[55:16.440 --> 55:20.800]  do that and get him exposed but we have to do it because it's a disaster what's
[55:20.800 --> 55:24.800]  going on we get him out of office everything he's done is void or
[55:24.800 --> 55:29.920]  avoidable it's voidable so it would be void and we have to do it and my website
[55:29.920 --> 55:33.880]  is Obama crimes.com if they go there they can check the latest on my lawsuit
[55:33.880 --> 55:37.920]  which is going to US Supreme Court and I think that's a shot we have but the
[55:37.920 --> 55:43.040]  courts have not been with us they've been in the pocket of Obama perhaps now
[55:43.040 --> 55:47.760]  things will change because the powers that they may want to change and
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.280]  they'll go our way so keep our fingers crossed. Thank you so much Phil Berg we'll
[55:52.280 --> 55:57.600]  talk to you again soon have a good new year. Thank you. Webster from the
[55:57.600 --> 56:02.120]  beginning I thought they were building Obama up as Messianic to later destroy
[56:02.120 --> 56:07.040]  him I predicted that over a year and a half ago in the Obama deception when his
[56:07.040 --> 56:10.480]  approval rating was still at about 70 points when that film came out or above
[56:10.480 --> 56:16.600]  70 I believe this has all been scripted do you have a different view of that A
[56:16.600 --> 56:21.400]  and B how do you see it ending well it's inevitable that when when Obama ran for
[56:21.400 --> 56:27.320]  president with all of these Messianic promises utopian delusions you know that
[56:27.320 --> 56:33.200]  the messiah and all this that that they would be a very severe let down which
[56:33.200 --> 56:37.400]  would be much more severe than the usual disillusionment with the president when
[56:37.400 --> 56:41.320]  they when they begin to break their promises so with Obama this is a very
[56:41.320 --> 56:46.200]  very significant because here the you know the the mistaken identity case was
[56:46.200 --> 56:50.280]  was was very severe now there are two things that could happen now one is
[56:50.280 --> 56:54.960]  Darrell Issa and these Republicans take their constitutional responsibilities
[56:54.960 --> 57:01.240]  seriously and there's some chance that they might and they delve into this get
[57:01.240 --> 57:05.640]  that birth certificate out there the chances are though as you mentioned that
[57:05.640 --> 57:10.320]  if if Glenn Beck says stay away from the issue that means Rupert Murdoch is
[57:10.320 --> 57:13.880]  saying stay away from the issue that means the Rupert Murdoch George Schultz
[57:13.880 --> 57:19.280]  Koch brothers faction in the ruling class they say we want two more years of
[57:19.280 --> 57:23.640]  blackmail you know we want and we want to guarantee that the that the Republicans
[57:23.640 --> 57:28.080]  have Obama to run against it's worse than that Carl Rove is attacking anybody
[57:28.080 --> 57:32.440]  who may run against Obama and the Democrats everywhere he wants he wants
[57:32.440 --> 57:38.920]  six more years right so that one is what is Darrell Issa it does something that
[57:38.920 --> 57:43.920]  would be a surprise to me the other one is maybe the Clintons if they see that
[57:43.920 --> 57:48.640]  Obama is is hemorrhaging and and collapsing into the into the spring
[57:48.640 --> 57:53.000]  time and maybe into the early summer they may then take the plunge or some
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.000]  somebody sent forward by them a stalking horse for the Clintons might
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.120]  emerge everybody talks about Russ Feingold of Wisconsin it's an obvious
[58:02.120 --> 58:05.920]  choice I would welcome it I would welcome anybody getting in on the
[58:05.920 --> 58:10.720]  Democratic side anybody of any note would tend to break the ice and indeed
[58:10.720 --> 58:16.200]  show the pent-up resentment and desire to get rid of Obama that exists in the
[58:16.200 --> 58:20.240]  Democratic base do you like Russ Feingold because he voted against the
[58:20.240 --> 58:26.600]  Patriot Act he has some signs in his resume that he's an independent
[58:26.600 --> 58:30.080]  thinker and again I don't care I don't really care who it is structurally the
[58:30.080 --> 58:34.120]  important thing is somebody should do it doesn't really matter because Obama is
[58:34.120 --> 58:37.440]  a complete puppet all right Webster have a great new year coming up we'll be
[58:37.440 --> 58:43.480]  right back with a second hour stay with us the GCN radio network providing the

[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.640]  alex jones
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:34.120]  well I really enjoyed having him in studio a few months with us a few months
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.840]  ago with us and I look forward to having back in studio but for the next 30
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:42.760]  minutes he joins us via telephone he of course is the editor of natural news
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.360]  dot-com we post a lot of their great reports at info wars dot-com and
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:54.240]  prison planet dot-com I want to get in the short segment into a swine flu
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.520]  pandemic outbreak sweeping through Britain even though 70% were vaccinated
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.920]  last year you have the Canadian studies and government studies in Europe
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:08.520]  showing that it lowers your immunity by about 50% when you take the H1N1 shot
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.080]  to the regular seasonal flu now you don't have a choice they're combining
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.320]  both and so I wanted to talk just briefly with Mike Adams about that
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:22.360]  then we're gonna come back with the big story here homeland security and US
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.640]  Treasury are involved with the food safety bill invoking codex that's you
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.560]  in takeover harmonization and grants FDA authority to police food safety of
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:37.320]  foreign nations kind of like we just discovered that the drug enforcement
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.280]  agency is running around as a global spy agency non-drug related this is a
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.880]  global corporate government with the US taxpayer fit in the bill so that's
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.960]  coming up the next segment but let's look at flu season first obviously record
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.800]  low numbers of people took it here last year because of your work and others
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.680]  exposing it is dangerous which has now been proven by the British Medical
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.880]  Journal the EU Medical Board and others but Mike now they're back fear
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.640]  mongering tell us about that well they are they are fear mongering as usual
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:12.320]  Alex you're right on target even though about 70% of the over 65 population was
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:17.560]  vaccinated last year in the UK there's they're already saying that there's a
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.280]  new pandemic sweeping through the country several hundred people are in
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.680]  hospitals now suffering from swine flu but there's a number that they never
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:31.280]  tell you they never say how many of those sick people were it were vaccinated
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.320]  either this year or last year because there's something that I call the
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.040]  reinfection rate and it's a very high number we don't know how high it is
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.200]  because they won't release the number they won't do the studies on this but
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.640]  people who are vaccinated have a weakened immune system when they face
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:55.200]  future exposure to infectious disease so I'm sure your listeners are on board
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.000]  with this they they're well informed they already know this but the mainstream
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.080]  conventional medical community denies this they try to apply that if you're
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:08.240]  vaccinated it's a hundred percent you know you take the shot you won't get
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.760]  sick well that's a that's a fraud in fact it's marketing fraud if the FTC the
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.360]  federal trade commission actually enforced you know false marketing
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.840]  regulation against the drug companies they would go after them for making those
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:27.040]  claims because vaccines don't work a hundred percent in fact if you look at
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:31.640]  the science and I have and I've written about it and and you have to they're
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:36.880]  about one percent effective if you believe the drug companies own studies
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.160]  so for every 100 people who are vaccinated you're going to reduce flu
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.200]  symptoms in about one person but that's on the benefit end when you look at the
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.040]  negative effects as you know but for those that don't every major study out
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.200]  there shows vaccines lower overall immunity including to the things that
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.360]  they're supposedly protecting you from and the anecdotal on the street is it's
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:05.120]  common knowledge that I took the flu shot and got the flu I mean it's common
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.040]  sense well exactly there are dangerous chemicals in these vaccines there are
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.960]  chemical adjuvant which are designed to cause an inflammation response of the
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.080]  immune system but it also causes inflammation of the nervous system so
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:24.240]  it's linked to all kinds of nervous system problems and now here's the big
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.240]  untold story about vaccines is the miscarriages women who are getting
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.280]  vaccinated when they have a child and that's in the Australian news stay
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.080]  there I want you to recap that get into the miscarriages the Australian
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.280]  government's been admitting it they're trying to cover it up here the British
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.560]  government admits a tenfold increase in seizures in children taking it and they
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.800]  suspended it but the government and the media and and and these pharmacies put
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.320]  out fact sheets they print up saying no danger but if any of you ask for the
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.160]  actual insert it says this stuff can kill you we'll be right back with Mike Adams

[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:05.320]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.920]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.240]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.200]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:21.560]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.880]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.640]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:33.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.000]  families lose their power from weather-related onages number five a

[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.400]  attention London Guardian comes out British government admits tenfold
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:36.000]  increase in seizures of children that took the H1N1 shot they admit it's
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.560]  causing with the adjuvants an autoimmune response brain swelling big studies
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.040]  linking it to pancreas failure it's more than just the corn syrup making the
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:48.520]  pancreas go out it's causing autoimmune problems and in key organs like the
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:54.120]  brain the pancreas the liver it's bad news but now it's actually being admitted
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.000]  in Australia the massive miscarriages if you go back just two years ago they
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.800]  always said don't give flu shots to women now they say we're pregnant now
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:06.000]  it's oh more important if you're pregnant they're just practicing murdering

[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.680]  Mike Adams one of the leading alternative health experts out there very
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.600]  respected recapping what you were covering with the 2010 flu hoax maybe
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.520]  we should briefly look at the 2009 and then that miscarriage information we're
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:58.840]  trying to save some lives here then we'll shift gears into the UN angle of
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.080]  the food enslavement bill sure well you gotta realize that the drug companies
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.600]  the vaccine manufacturers they have to fabricate an emergency every year in
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:13.920]  order to try to get people to take take these shots and so this year that has
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:17.840]  failed for the most part people were not getting vaccinated people learn their
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.360]  lesson from last year you know the big twine flu hoax crashed and burned and
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.720]  also people who didn't take the shot who instead took vitamin B and who took
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.040]  superfoods like your sponsor enter food and other good foods out there and who
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.880]  took care of their health they were fine they didn't get sick and they a lot of
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.440]  them woke up and they realized we we don't need the vaccine we're gonna be
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:44.400]  healthier without it so now because their propaganda is failing they have to push
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.680]  it and that's what they're doing now in the UK they're pushing it there are a
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.280]  couple hundred people in the hospitals who are suffering from swine flu and
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.800]  they're saying everybody needs to get vaccinated now they're saying we got to
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.280]  revisit the vaccinations for children under five years old because they pulled
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.520]  those vaccines previously for children under five in the National Health
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.240]  Service because of the potential risk but now they're saying well because of
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.840]  this this pandemic breaking out we got to vaccinate all those kids and in the
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:17.720]  US as you hinted they're now saying we got to vaccinate pregnant women too so
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.880]  that their children can be quote protected and by the way I also saw an
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:26.320]  article recently saying that they're promoting chemo therapy for pregnant
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.920]  women saying it's safe to have a chemo even when you have a child inside you
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.720]  this is this is medical insanity I mean how many well they're setting the
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.680]  precedent they're setting the precedent to get away with mass murder and they
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.360]  know what they're doing they're turning health purely into a death camp a
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:48.080]  eugenics camp as Ted Turner and Bill Gates have admitted I mean this they
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.280]  mean business and for those that don't know I remember just a few years ago it
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.120]  always said in the inserts and I've had medical doctors on that appointed this
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.640]  out that you never give a pregnant woman a vaccine because if they know it
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.920]  causes autoimmune inflammation not just in the brain but in the fetus and
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:09.360]  triggers massive increases in miscarriages this time they said women who
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:14.480]  have babies and they're in their uterus you're the one that really needs this I
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:19.000]  mean what an outrageous thing they did and I've seen it the only country to be
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.800]  admitting it is Australia where and where they're admitting this is causing
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.440]  them of the death of babies well it's astonishing in all this if you look
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:31.600]  across the government bureaucracy and you know you have you had Rand Paul on a
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.120]  couple of weeks ago talking about how these bureaucrats create laws themselves
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.760]  essentially by creating regulations they're unelected but they create
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:45.480]  regulations like the FDA and the TSA and the DEA and so on these government
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.320]  bodies they now they just blatantly lie they don't even care about telling the
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.880]  truth they don't even care if they're caught in a lie they just keep lying
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:59.040]  because most people keep buying it so they throw out the evidence of harm for
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:03.600]  vaccines you know the TSA tries to dismiss any of these complaints about
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.400]  you know people reaching down their pants and so on they say oh it's for
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.120]  your own good I mean that you've been all over that issue so you know what I'm
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:14.720]  talking about but every agency now is just running rampant across our freedoms
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.680]  and across the Constitution and now with the food safety bill which I know
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.760]  we're going to talk about here our food is at risk they want to control our food
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.920]  they want to reach into our refrigerators the same way the TSA has
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.440]  been reaching down our pants that's what's happened that's what's coming our
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:37.080]  way now in 2011 incredible let's get in to the homeland security tie-in it was
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:41.440]  admitted even in the Wall Street Journal a record 12 million given in the month
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:46.200]  of November to get the house to pass the draconian takeover the 12 million was
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:51.840]  given completely by mega agribusiness to shut down their competitions let's go
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.120]  over it all right well let's set the frame here for your listeners the the
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.360]  bill proponents said that this is all about food safety we're going to save
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:07.240]  5,000 lives a year you know the FDA is a good agency it's going to protect your
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:12.160]  food and protect your children and so on well what they didn't tell you is for
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:17.280]  example did you know that E. Coli according to the CDC itself only kills
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.720]  about 82 Americans a year through food transmission 82 people more people are
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:28.120]  killed by lightning in America that are killed by E. Coli and yet they made this
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:32.040]  into a big scare story and that's a CDC statistic by the way you can you can see
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:37.640]  right on the government website and then they hid things in the bill things
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.800]  that are just now starting to come out I've been reading this bill Alex going
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:45.440]  through it with a fine-tooth comb because you know how how crazy these
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.520]  bills can get where you have to reference this section and delete that
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.440]  phrase from that paragraph it's really hard to read but if you get to this and
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:18:00.720]  you actually read it it turns out that this bill says that the FDA has to put
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:06.800]  forth quote recommendations on whether and how to harmonize requirements under
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:13.360]  codex Alimentarius it's right there the open world government standardization
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.160]  this is well I mean when you see the food safety bill it's what's in codex
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.840]  Alimentarius it's global standardization now they're not even denying that they're
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:27.480]  openly trying to bring us under this world government to shut down local
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.680]  farms and ranches because people are discovering that we're being poisoned
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.440]  intentionally through the GMO people are getting the Rockefeller Foundation
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:40.160]  documents about vaccines having sterile and sadded it's all coming out and as
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:44.720]  the UN said in the 1996 food summit in Beijing China they would use food as a
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:50.320]  weapon they are using it as a weapon so it is our duty to start eating non GMO
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.320]  it's our duty to start gardens it's our duty even if they pass this to literally
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:59.040]  rebel and they're setting up the SWAT teams everything they're SWAT teaming
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:03.960]  the Amish to grow those tomatoes and then let them try to arrest you and then
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:09.880]  further discredit these hordes of demons they've recruited yeah exactly it's the
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:13.360]  most patriotic thing that you could do perhaps right now is to grow your own
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.080]  food and and sell it at a local farmers market sell it to your neighbors sell it
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.640]  to your community members you know grow some honest tomatoes and just sell them
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.680]  and this is what the government precisely doesn't want you to do and that's why
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:32.200]  they've created all of this this dark globalist language in this bill let me
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.840]  give you some other example stay there we're gonna come back and hit this we
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:39.880]  gotta go to break but think about it ladies and gentlemen in the 1930s
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:45.640]  Stalin couldn't crush the poor farmers he wanted to collectivize them like
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:50.400]  Mal later didn't kill 60 plus million people so he said you can't grow your
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:55.560]  own gardens anymore and starved 30 plus million people to death I mean they're
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:01.480]  not playing games these are hardcore criminals we'll be right back is it
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:05.360]  really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys 18
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.240]  years ago we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90

[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:24.440]  right now Mike continuing I mean you've got quote in your article it's up at
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.080]  naturalnews.com it's up at info wars and prison planet people want to read it
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:32.080]  food safety bill invokes codex harmonization and grants FDA authority
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.640]  to police food safety for foreign nations I mean this is the global
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:39.000]  government right here and they mentioned it's codex alimentarius tell folks what
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.560]  section 308 really means okay well first of all for those who are skeptical and
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.080]  you know I encourage people to be critical thinkers and they want to see
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.920]  this for themselves if you go to the Thomas government search engine where
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:57.480]  you can search bills you put in HR 2751 because that's what this was passed
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:03.760]  under and you bring up this PDF file go to page 195 you'll see this language for
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.600]  yourself and you'll also see section 308 it's called the foreign offices of the
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:13.600]  food and drug administration yes I we're not kidding that the FDA is going to
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:18.720]  set up enforcement offices in other nations other countries and they're
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.840]  going to dictate these countries how they should run their food safety systems
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:29.320]  so that when they export food to the United States it adheres to quote FDA
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.840]  standards which by the way means that all your food should be dead
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.320]  pasteurized fumigated or otherwise killed or
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:44.000]  nutritively destroyed in to the FDA the only safe food is dead food well and
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.800]  they openly tell local farmers get bigger get out we know they force the
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:55.160]  Iraqis to only take Monsanto GMO crops I mean this is a strategic military
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:59.680]  takeover well yeah and additional evidence came out in the WikiLeaks cables
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:05.760]  which shows that Spain was involved with the US ambassador to France and the
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:11.000]  GMO companies pushing GMOs into Europe and they were creating a quote
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.120]  retaliatory target list of who to go after if they resisted GMOs I mean this
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.360]  is all in the cable so we know there is a GMO global conspiracy and that's it's
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.600]  not it's not a theory it's a it's a real conspiracy that's happening right now
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.440]  and now with this food safety bill we know that the FDA is going to try to run
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:35.280]  the food safety programs of other nations and try to harmonize America
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.160]  with Codex this this is coming you know we've been talking about this for how
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:46.240]  many years Alex and it's coming now that it is now about to be signed by Obama
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:52.920]  and become law and be enforced absolutely continue this is important
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:56.480]  what you're talking about all right well it also involves the Department of
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:01.400]  Homeland Security this language is right in the bill it says that in developing
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:06.600]  this plan the FDA is going to consult with these different departments which
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:11.760]  they call stakeholders the stakeholders in the food safety bill include the
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:17.720]  Department of Homeland Security and get this the US Treasury what is the
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:23.440]  Treasury doing in my kitchen why is the Treasury why does it have its hands in
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:27.440]  the food supply issues well you already know the answer I think your
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.480]  listeners probably do too but the people voting on this bill you know the
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.960]  naive senators and and members of the House who voted for this they probably
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:40.360]  don't get it or most of them don't but they're this is all tied in with
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:44.920]  centralizing control control over security control over the money supply
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:49.720]  control over the food supply and control over your health or actually your sick
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:55.400]  care so once they've got the control then you don't have options you don't
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:58.080]  have an option to go grow your own medicine in your backyard because you
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.040]  can grow medicine your natural herbal medicine and superfoods you can grow
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:05.720]  them in your backyard they don't want you to do that because that way you are
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.760]  a slave to the medical system but you have to go pay money for prescriptions
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:13.920]  and you have to keep paying month after month year after year until you one day
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.480]  died bankrupt as another victim of big pharma they have these systems of
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.960]  control the grass is getting worse and thank goodness that there are still
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:27.000]  freedom fighters out there like you Alex like the health freedom organizations
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.560]  out there who are trying to stand up who are doing a good job actually of
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.160]  standing up and bringing attention to this issue and helping us lead the
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:37.920]  fight to resist tyranny and restore the freedoms that we are supposed to be
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:43.640]  guaranteed under the United States Constitution Mike I couldn't say it
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:49.440]  anymore focused or succinctly than that and you know in closing I just over the
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:53.160]  years see the mainstream media make fun of us about Codex Alimentarius what all
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:56.940]  we're doing is covering what the private corporations of the UN and the
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:00.720]  World Trade Organization are announcing and then now here it is in the bill and
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:04.560]  there's no discussion of it thank God you found it in there it's always
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:10.160]  changing but you say they they're hiding it in plain sight you know I hear you
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.800]  use that phrase quite a bit you're exactly right they hide it in plain
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.080]  sight they put it right in there it's a government record that's a certified
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.440]  government document if you open up that PDF if it's a certified government
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.920]  document the language is right in there use the search function yourself you
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:27.400]  can see it you can read it and you can bet the FDA is going to act on it they
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.120]  are they're gonna push this agenda it's now about to become law this is

[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:19.040]  well we had him on a few weeks ago and he's back via popular demand but
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:22.040]  unfortunately we've only got a half hour with him but I look forward to having
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:25.120]  him up for a full hour in the near future perhaps to even take more of your
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:30.400]  phone calls he's Porter Stansbury he's got a long bio but he's made a lot of
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:34.080]  incredible predictions that a barons is called and others have called a dire
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.800]  prophecy even the Wall Street Journal has written articles we've got those
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:43.960]  linked up on info wars.com amazed by how accurate his predictions are and I
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:48.280]  want to give you the website and it's linked and banners up on info wars.com
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:52.320]  where you can watch a free video presentation that Porter put together
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:58.120]  but but I wanted to have him back on to really quantify this for people so that
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.360]  folks understand what dollar devaluation and the deep pegging of the
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:07.320]  dollar the World Reserve currency really means I mean people hear Glenn Beck
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:11.000]  talk about it they hear people discuss it they laughed at us a decade ago when
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.880]  they got rid of Glass-Steagall and we warned people what was going to happen
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:19.040]  with economists and this is really common sense as Porter has said but the
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.480]  media has tried to deny common sense now they're having to admit it but they're
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:25.480]  still not telling people how serious this is going to be Porter from your
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:29.960]  deep research of this and in the video end of America the number 3.com that's
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:34.760]  one word end of America number 3.com to watch that free presentation that's
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:38.840]  so valuable it's got a lot of solutions as well I mean quantify what this means
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:45.320]  for people. Well Alex thanks for having me back on and one of the things I'm
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:49.400]  trying to do is just raise some awareness about the magnitude of this problem
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.720]  because I think people have heard this a couple times over the years you were
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:56.800]  back in the early 90s the government shut down for a couple weeks and there
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:00.360]  were some issues about our debts getting out of control people were aware of the
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.080]  problem but then it kind of goes on the back burner again and now it's back on
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.800]  the forefront because the deficits are really soaring again so now people are
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:12.200]  worried but the problem the problem is that from my point of view Alex is
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:17.280]  that the numbers have now gotten so large that there is no plausible way that
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:21.840]  we can ever repay the debt and that leads our government to one solution
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:27.000]  which is to print lots of new dollar bills to pay our obligations the only way
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.320]  we can pay for them is by inflation and just so you'll know the extent of the
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:35.800]  problem if you look at the income tax and the corporate tax from the last year
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:40.080]  that was collected that was the tax that the federal government got if you
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.400]  doubled that if you increase the actual revenues by a hundred percent it still
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:49.840]  wouldn't have covered our deficit from last year so there is no there's no way
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:53.640]  that we're going to be able to contain these deficits and obviously if you can't
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.560]  contain the deficits you're never going to repay the principal and the total
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.960]  liability today right now Alex for all the government's debts and for all of
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:07.760]  the things the government has promised to give people like Medicare and Social
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:12.480]  Security all of our future liabilities the total bill per taxpayer is now over a
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.800]  million dollars so how many of those taxpayers are actually going to ever be
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.200]  able to finance their million dollar obligation to the federal government and
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:25.680]  how will any of that money ever actually get paid and that's what I'm trying to
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:30.440]  warn people about there is no way these debts can even be financed and if you
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:34.560]  can't finance the debts then you have to start printing money and that is where
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:40.440]  that's where we are that's where we are right now today and the cartel that
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:43.440]  controls our planet these big financial institutions that have run us in the
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:48.960]  ground the made-off Ken lay types I mean they can care less because they're
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.040]  going to be left with all the loot we're going to be left with all the all the
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:56.920]  debt you know I talked about quantifying it you talk about it becoming
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:01.040]  clear that we've lost World Reserve currency this year about a week after
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:04.760]  you were on the Russians and Chinese officially started doing trade between
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.880]  each other in the Chinese currency we see golden silver rocketing back up I
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:13.960]  mean what when do you see it I mean you've pointed out the dominoes have
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:18.200]  already fallen it's kind of like a corpse that's cooling off right now or
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.040]  starting to go into rigor mortis but but I mean how do you see those phases how
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:25.120]  do you see it becoming more evident I mean what's it gonna look like on the
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:29.000]  street what does it mean to the average person to lose the dollars World Reserve
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.760]  currency I can't tell you how many people on the street have said Alex I see
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:36.760]  your show I hear it but you know I'm not in the stock market or why should I care
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:40.880]  why should they care well you know Alex a great a great example of how this
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.480]  affects people every day in their lives is look what's happened to the price of
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:48.880]  gasoline just in the last couple months it's gone back above three dollars a
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.320]  gallon at least where I buy gas here on the East Coast and I think that's
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:56.360]  probably true nationwide on average the gas is now both three dollars a gallon
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:00.600]  again how did that happen Alex our economy hasn't grown demand for gas
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.240]  to lean has it changed appreciably and yet the price of gas has gone from
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:09.040]  already from the low two dollar range all the way back over to three dollars
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.600]  well one of the top I'm sorry to interrupt but it's Porter but you're
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.400]  right one of the top shell exec said it's gonna be five dollars in the next
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:21.160]  year it will be and and what I mean when people can't well but what was funny of
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:24.040]  course that the American people are gonna are gonna rail against the oil
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:27.960]  companies and they're gonna blame them for higher gas prices the oil companies
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:32.200]  have nothing to do with the global price of gasoline you know that's set by the
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:35.880]  supply of oil it's set by the value of the dollar and it's set by the amount of
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:40.960]  refineries they haven't built a refinery the United States has 1975 so you know
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:46.600]  there isn't a very large increase in the ability to to convert oil to gas that's
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.320]  one problem with the gas price but the by far the bigger problem is that the
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.040]  value of the dollar is collapsing you know you see the price of gas go up by
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:58.760]  50% you see the price of gold double in two years you see the price of silver
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:02.440]  triple in two years when are people gonna wake up and say oh you know what
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:05.360]  there's some downside to all this quantitative easing there's some
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.000]  downside to this creating trillions of dollars to bail out Fannie Mae and
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.480]  Freddie Mac so that Americans could still have cheap mortgages there are
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:16.720]  downsides to this government policy of runaway debts and money praying to pay
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.200]  for it and the way it's gonna the number one way it's gonna affect people is in
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:24.680]  the grocery store at the gas pump and I promise you you know corn is at a new
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:28.080]  record price and I'm sure the farmers think that's great but you know what
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:30.920]  it's gonna there's gonna be there's gonna be a big problem for a lot of
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:34.400]  people especially the people who are in food stamps yeah a lot of folks say well
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:38.760]  I don't get ears of corn corn is a filler in almost every processed food
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:43.360]  that's right and think about this there are 40 million Americans today not in
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:47.280]  the future today on food stamps how what do you think they're gonna do when the
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.520]  price of food doubles again next year and they can't afford to feed their
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:53.120]  families you think they're just gonna sit in their government subsidized
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:56.920]  apartments calmly why they why they why they can't feed their children no way
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:00.640]  you know what's gonna happen there's gonna be a huge problem with crime in
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.640]  the cities and with people rioting that by the way money for food Porter I've
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.960]  got reports all over the country in major cities doubling of rapes doubling of
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:14.080]  robberies I've got CNN articles today it's already happening yeah and you know
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:19.000]  these things are really truly just the beginning and people have still they
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.320]  have no idea what has already been baked into the cake I mean you cannot you
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.280]  cannot spend if you're the federal government next year planning to spend
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.280]  four trillion dollars four trillion dollars you're playing to spend you've
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:36.480]  only got taxes to cover about 25% of that that's three trillion dollars gonna
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.400]  be added to our budget next year alone you know sooner or later accreditors are
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:44.880]  gonna go forget it we're not we're not we're not gonna do this anymore and then
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:48.000]  the only thing left to do is gonna be totally to supply all that money by
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.920]  printing right now you know the quantitative easing currently underway
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:55.000]  is six hundred billion dollars which is a lot that's why the prices of
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.400]  everything are going up but when that six hundred billion goes to a trillion
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.560]  dollars of quantitative easing or two trillion dollars of quantitative easing
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:06.960]  things are gonna get out of control really quickly now you also write
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.120]  extensively and I'm reading over it it's just excellent advice about ways
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:16.600]  people can protect themselves and I know you can't individually diagnose people
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:19.720]  you can just give them general systems that have really you know worked in the
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:23.640]  past you've got a wide range of you know deep newsletters and analysis and
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.200]  information people can find out more by going to end of America the number three
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.080]  dot-com and watching the free video or linking through on banners we have up on
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:37.280]  info wars dot-com and present on it dot-com but but how do people protect
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:42.440]  themselves from this unraveling well you got you you really have there's three
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.120]  things that you have to do number one you have to own real money which is gold
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.360]  and silver you have to own real money because as the global monetary system
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.600]  collapses because it's all based on the dollar if that all falls apart you know
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:57.920]  gold and silver are gonna be the only things that really hold their value and
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:01.720]  will allow you to buy anything else you need and then the number and number two
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:05.640]  things are you have to invest in energy and agriculture because those global
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:09.120]  systems are going to be the ones that are most harmed by the ongoing
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.760]  inflation just just one quick note just to point out to you that what I'm
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:17.320]  saying is happening right now if you look just in the last three months shares
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.880]  of Monsanto which is that you know the big seed company that a lot of people
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.000]  don't like because they use genetic engineering and their seeds and there
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.280]  some people are very afraid of that I'm not commenting on whether or not that's
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:31.560]  a good or a bad idea I'm commenting on the fact that farmers around the world
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:35.360]  buy that seed because it's very productive their share price has come from
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:40.080]  forty five dollars to almost seventy dollars in the last three months there
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:44.160]  is no plausible explanation for that kind of a move and that thing of a
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:50.400]  company unless you know that inflation is coming to agriculture well all the
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.200]  financial experts and economists we've had on have been saying for two years
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:58.760]  that this inflation was going to accelerate right around 2010 2011 and
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:05.760]  now I see the headlines 45% increase in the rice 50% and corn 30% in this I
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:09.560]  mean it's going up across the board and when I've studied hyperinflation
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:14.120]  throughout history Porter am I right in saying that the further you get along the
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:20.160]  faster it moves exactly because the only way to deal with you know these
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:25.040]  rising prices are now going to cause more credit problems gonna cause more
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:29.520]  deficit spending it's it's kind of a cycle that builds on itself Alex and you
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:32.880]  know you can guarantee that the government is not going to say no we have
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:37.040]  to put a stop to this we have to let companies go into into default we have
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:41.120]  to let banks fail we have to stop spending money we don't have and a
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:45.520]  democracy that's never going to happen because there is there is no political
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:50.840]  organization that stands for sound money and sound policies you've got the
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:54.440]  Republicans who want to cut taxes you got the Democrats who want to spend and
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:57.720]  if you look at the deal they just cut last month you see what do they agree to
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:02.920]  do they agreed to cut taxes and spend more that that's exactly the opposite of
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:06.200]  what we need to happen and that's what's causing that's the root of this problem
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.400]  there is no political consensus in this country to have sound money and to have
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:15.320]  found and to have a balanced budget well still if you talk to the average
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:19.400]  yuppie about having sound money getting rid of the Federal Reserve they laugh at
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:25.240]  you it's it's a type of brainwashed received knowledge to giggle at anyone
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:28.960]  that warns them again even Glenn Beckett's attack for warning people about
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:33.560]  this and so you we're looking at some people that are really going to be
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:36.800]  helpless what do you predict they're going to do I'm worried about the
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:43.120]  government forming them into a zombie army to push for total government total
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:49.280]  taxation of the middle class to feed them during this crisis I'm not saying
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.160]  that you're wrong about that that might happen but what I'm saying to you is
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:56.560]  that that will not solve the problem if you doubled if you doubled the tax
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:01.680]  revenues from last year we still would have had a deficit you cannot solve this
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:06.600]  fiscal problem by raising taxes it cannot be done the only way to solve this
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:11.280]  problem is by drastically reducing the government overhead and we both know
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.640]  that'll never happen in this country because more than 50% of the people that
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:21.400]  vote don't pay taxes so there is no way this this this set of incentives the
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.480]  structure we have right now in our government can survive and the way it
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.920]  will be destroyed is through a massive inflation that is underway right now as
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.600]  far as the yuppie laughing about people saying we need to have sound money we
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.760]  need to have money backed by gold and silver let me tell you what it's the
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:41.360]  greatest lie those ever been told we convinced American people over the last
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:46.600]  50 years that a piece of paper was more valuable and better than gold and
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.600]  silver that is that is that is incredible it's never happened before in
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:56.480]  history that the World Reserve currency was backed purely by nothing and people
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:00.760]  are gonna learn an enormously painful lesson that you can't have money that's
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:06.440]  backed by nothing because pretty soon all you're gonna have is nothing well I
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:10.360]  wish you were wrong but history is replete with examples every economic
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:14.680]  indicator shows you're 100% right and Porter I have to agree with you not
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:22.040]  because you know I your information is like some type of you know crystal ball
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:28.640]  prediction it's as you said this is the facts this is the reality yeah it's a
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.520]  it's I wish I was wrong too in fact if you know if your listeners want to look
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.600]  at the video I've made about all these issues to get to the details of it you
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:40.720]  know you're gonna see me saying repeatedly look this is the fact you you
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:45.760]  know I didn't make this number up you know our you know US federal spending
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:50.440]  really is four trillion dollars and you know total income tax and corporate tax
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:54.920]  revenue really is only a trillion dollars so you know all these numbers are
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:47:00.000]  there for people to consider but the problem as I see it is that people
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  don't realize that we are finally reached the point where you can't just
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:09.600]  kick the can down the road because the the the rate of increase of the size of
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:15.360]  these debts and the financing costs have become sort of parabolic I mean the
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:20.200]  total national government debt the federal debt has doubled since 2000 and
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.800]  as you know Porter that's only what's due right now that's always do right now
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:29.920]  obligations and for those that don't know the website to see the free video is
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:37.040]  end of America the number three dot com and Porter Stansbury predicted the
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.200]  collapse of GM Fannie Mae years before it happened Freddie Mac and America's
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.360]  biggest mall owner general growth properties a few years ago in fact
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:49.440]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy and and again even the Wall Street
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:52.880]  Journal many other publications Kitco say this guy's got some of the most
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:56.880]  accurate predictions out there but as Porter has said this isn't one of his
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:02.000]  big you know complex predictions based on you know a whole bunch of data this
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.240]  information is all right out there in the open for everyone who wants to know
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:13.560]  the truth and I happen to agree with him there is not the political will or the
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:20.520]  education or the lobby out there that wants to stand for saving our economy
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:24.760]  these are cutthroat offshore corporations that are all greedy to
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:30.160]  consolidate their bottom line and out of crises because they know what's coming
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:34.200]  they're prepositioned they're going into all the raw materials for at least five
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:40.200]  years into the farming stocks into you all these areas that we've been telling
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:45.880]  you to get into and Porter what's gonna happen as things really start to
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:50.200]  unravel faster and finally the dumbed-down masses figure out where the
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:54.760]  good investments are will those not create super bubbles I tell you what
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:59.680]  Alex my my my real fear and I either I understand this sounds alarmist and I
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:04.640]  wish it didn't but my real big fear actually relates to oil and gas prices
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:10.640]  and the in the federal food stamps programs because you know I don't think
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:14.240]  it's gonna be very long at all before gas is over $5 to Gallant and when
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:18.120]  people can't afford to drive to work anymore and when people can't afford to
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:21.720]  buy groceries anymore food stamps you're not gonna just have a financial
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:26.160]  problem you're gonna have a really big societal problem and you know it's
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:29.160]  already happening in places like Atlanta I don't know if you know this or not but
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:33.440]  you know Marta is the big public transport system in Atlanta and because
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:37.920]  of the fiscal crisis they've had to cut the the number of routes and the
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:41.520]  availability of the public transportation and that's resulted in a lot of
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:46.640]  people not being able to get to their to get to work and so you see that now the
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:50.120]  airport workers a lot of them have to sleep in the airport at night just to
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:53.480]  be at work the next morning because the buses don't start running until seven
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:56.640]  o'clock instead of the youth to start you know five in the morning so you've
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.920]  already you're already beginning to see at the edges these things fraying you
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:03.440]  know these things coming apart and by the way it's 43 million people now on
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:07.520]  food stamps I mean it's growing I mean that's just it's just it's you know
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.440]  they're only roughly about a hundred a million a hundred million American
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:14.360]  households so you got to think to yourself is really is 40 percent or 40
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:18.000]  percent of the households in America on food stamps what has happened to our
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.800]  country you know what this whole big lie Alex that we could all live at the
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.160]  expense of our neighbors that somebody should pay for our mortgage somebody
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:29.200]  should pay for someone else should pay for our food somebody else should pay
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:34.280]  for our gas all this stuff I mean it's just a giant lie and it's all falling
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:38.960]  apart right now on the cold reality of that we cannot finance our debts
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:43.080]  anymore I want to talk about generally what you're recommending people to
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:47.440]  protect themselves but it's all covered in more detail at end of America the
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:51.560]  number three dot com and we've got banners up on info wars calm to this
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:55.000]  video because it's so important right now if you want to go check it out watch
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.960]  the video send the link out to folks because we need to face up to what we're

[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:08.340]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did
[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:11.460]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:15.080]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:18.920]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:22.480]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:27.960]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless

[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:20.440]  Cowboys Mark Stipnowski joining us that with a big announcement coming up in the
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:25.520]  next hour along with an engineer to talk about some 9-11 issues but I'm gonna
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:28.440]  hold our guests five minutes into the next hour with us because it's
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:33.240]  impossible to have Porter Stansbury on for just 30 minutes there's so much I
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:36.320]  could talk about with this guy I had him on for an hour and a half a few weeks
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:40.040]  ago but Porter I was asking you during the break what do you want to cover
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:43.680]  solutions but I know those are so technical folks should go check out the
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:49.560]  video that's free at end of America the number three calm or do you want to get
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:52.800]  into some of the things you see that are gonna unravel and you said how about a
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:58.440]  little bit of both let's get into the municipal situation those are already
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:03.760]  going bankrupt all over and it's only accelerating yeah I don't think really
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.560]  people understand the scope of the municipal debt problem I was talking
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:11.760]  with it with a guy whose name I can't share with you it was a confidential
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:16.040]  interview but I can tell you that he was the head of the muni desk at city group
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:21.040]  for the past 20 years and he personally brokered 20 30 billion dollars worth of
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:24.480]  high-yield municipal debt I mean you want to talk to a guy who knows where all
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:28.680]  the bodies are buried this is the guy and what he told me was was it not
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:33.080]  surprising really but I clarified that what the problem is going to be there
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:35.920]  the problem won't necessarily be with what they call the general obligation
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:39.760]  bonds of the states the cities because those bonds are going to be pretty well
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:43.760]  protected by tax revenues but that's not the that but even though even though
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:47.400]  that those are pretty safe there that's not even most of the deaths out there
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:51.360]  most of the dentists out there are these project bonds where if a government
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:57.720]  wanted to build like a like a shopping center or a parking garage or a football
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:01.840]  stadium something like that they would issue these these these bonds that were
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:06.480]  not backed by the state they were only backed by the revenue of that project and
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:10.240]  all these bonds are defaulting and it's kind of like the equivalent subprime
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:15.160]  debt and housing these these these project bonds that state and various
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:18.200]  municipalities issued and they're going to be huge problem and here's what's
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:20.760]  funny you're going to kick out of this a lot of these bonds have the same
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:24.280]  structure as actual subprime debt meaning that they have a variable
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:27.480]  interest rate component to them so that as interest rates go up all these
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:31.840]  bonds are going to default and this is going to cause an enormous problem that's
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:35.760]  a three trillion dollar market and so you know no one really knows what the
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:40.280]  solution is but I can tell you this if you are an investor in muni bonds you
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:44.960]  have to know whether or not you have these project bonds here portfolio and
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:49.480]  there's really no good way to find out and what does it mean for people that
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:55.520]  are retired firefighters police teachers city workers I mean this is gonna it
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:00.200]  sounds like we haven't seen one one one hundredth of the crisis no we haven't
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:03.200]  I'll give you a great example you you probably you probably know that they
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:06.560]  built a huge new football stadium up in New Jersey in the middle and complex
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:10.560]  area yes okay they've just built a huge new stadium did you know this they
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:15.360]  never paid for the old stadium the all of the debt that was outstanding to
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.920]  build the old stadium is still in place not a single penny of the principal was
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:23.280]  ever repaid and the taxpayers of state of New Jersey are still paying interest
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:27.920]  on the old stadium debt so they built a new stadium without even finished
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:32.240]  paying for the old stadium and then this is this is a quintessential example of
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:38.440]  how municipal finance has gone on all across the country and that's just one
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:44.080]  of tens of thousands of counties and cities and towns and all the debts
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:50.160]  they've racked up I mean we're in trouble this is the next year this is
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:54.120]  going to be the biggest financial story and of course it's just a prelude to
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:57.280]  the to what's going to happen because Alex you can you can know what's going
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:00.680]  to happen right the states are going to come in and guarantee all this project
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:03.560]  debt because if they don't they're going to get completely excluded from the
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:06.920]  credit markets forever and the state will go bankrupt sooner or later though a
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:10.120]  state will go bankrupt my bed is Illinois and they're going to lose their
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.520]  credit rating then the cost is going to go on it's gonna it's just gonna be a
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:18.000]  domino and guess who's gonna have to come in and save the states federal
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.320]  government and they're gonna lose the credit rating then that then the cost of
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:26.000]  debt goes up even more compounding it yeah so guys like you and me are gonna
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.120]  end up having to pay for all the idiocy of Chicago and all the idiocy of New
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:34.240]  Jersey and all the idiocy of California it's and whether you know are we gonna
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:39.760]  stand for it we better not stay there a porter man I wish we had 10 hours with
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:51.800]  this guy unbelievable on air online and on demand we are the GCN radio network
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:56.480]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:01.960]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:05.680]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've turned in this
[01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:10.760]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:16.120]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:21.040]  the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:25.440]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:29.160]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:33.120]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:38.680]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:44.400]  the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:51.400]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[01:59:51.400 --> 02:00:00.400]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:11.400]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:19.400]  Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:27.160]  Austin Texas Alex Jones. If you just joined us we're talking to Porter and
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:33.800]  Stansberry an amazing financial analyst and he's stating the facts the states
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:40.040]  the counties are already bankrupt we haven't even seen but a very small
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:44.800]  portion of the iceberg the federal government's bankrupt it's already
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:48.800]  losing its triple A rating with the Chinese and others when that becomes
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:54.200]  official will be like Greece or Ireland then tomorrow will go up even more and
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:01:00.640]  we will become like Argentina or Nigeria and notice that Will Ferrell's new movie
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:05.240]  at the end of it it's about corrupt bankers says the answer is tax the top
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:10.120]  2% they don't tell you that the top 2% are people making over 200,000 a year
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:13.360]  most of them those are the people that actually still buy stuff that still have
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:17.440]  employees it's the mega rich that are actually pushing all this against the
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:21.040]  middle class Porter you were talking about will we stand for this what's
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:26.720]  your take on it you know I don't have that answer it's a bit it's not just a
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:29.840]  financial it's a financial problem but this but the solution has to be
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:34.640]  political and I don't know how you solve that these problems when again more
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:39.240]  than half the people out there don't pay any federal taxes so it's it's so
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:42.880]  they're it's to their incentive to vote for more spending and I don't know how
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:48.200]  you win you know a political contest a popularity contest by promising people
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.600]  they're gonna get a lot less from the government well in a republic this would
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:56.440]  be illegal but in a democracy two wolves and a sheep the two wolves are gonna vote
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:00.600]  to eat Porter Stansbury that's right that's right I suggested in my newsletter
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:04.560]  recently that people should get as many votes as they have paid dollars and
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:07.760]  taxes and then I would change the incentives of the structure pretty
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:12.800]  tremendously of course that will never happen but well it but it gives you a
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:17.080]  sense of how warped the incentives right now are in our democracy well that's
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:20.920]  why we're in trouble because the big money the Hollywood people are getting
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:25.040]  ready to burn the middle class when it's the big mega elite that have actually
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:29.560]  gotten all the power out of this it's just so frightening but I guess the only
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:34.280]  answer is all we can do is try to inform people but also protect ourselves and
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:38.680]  you've got a huge team of experts and analysts it's all covered in the free
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:43.200]  video end of America the number three dot com just you know the number three
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:48.000]  end of America the number three dot com and Porter I should have asked you this
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.920]  earlier because we're almost out of time is there a number for people that aren't
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:55.240]  online if they want to call and find out about all the amazing research and
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:59.360]  different newsletters and information that Stansbury research has available
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:04.760]  Alex I'm sorry but no you know we really we really sell our stuff online we
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:09.320]  don't have that that number we understand folks should get to the library then or
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:12.560]  they should get to their neighbors because this is invaluable info we again
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:17.320]  end of America the number three dot com end of America as we know it Porter in
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.160]  a minute and a half what are some basic solutions for the average person the
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:24.920]  most important thing to do Alex is real simple you have to own some real money
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:29.000]  and that is that means gold bullion and silver bullion and you know you don't
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.720]  have to get fancy you don't have to buy the rare coins just go buy some some
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.040]  regular gold silver bullion put it someplace safe and then if you if you
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:41.360]  have a lot of assets you want to do some some investing I highly recommend
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:46.160]  becoming a little bit of an expert in agriculture and energy so that means a
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:50.040]  lot of the new gas resources a lot of the new kind of oil companies that are
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:54.040]  beginning to produce onshore in the United States and that means of course
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:58.960]  you know large seed companies and other kinds of ag businesses that are well
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:02.880]  run and managed and you know that those are the focuses right now above the
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:05.840]  newsletter that I write for Stanford research well I was reading stuff you
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.520]  wrote four years ago saying get into agra and that's been a great investment
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:14.320]  one of the only things that's been good other than gold and silver yeah that's
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:17.320]  you know it's been our focus for some some time because we're we've been
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:22.040]  afraid of this the risk of this kind of inflation and and we've been following
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:25.240]  the numbers for a long time as you know that's what led us to to avoid the
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:29.360]  disasters and the banks and with general motors and stuff like that but all this
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:32.120]  debt that was causing all those corporate problems have been has been
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:36.200]  shifted on to the US Treasury and it has never been repaid and it's not going
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:40.000]  away Porter stands very I want to get you up for a full hour very soon we

[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:35.800]  well Tony Zambodi a mechanical engineer and part of architects and engineers for
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:40.280]  9-11 truth now with over 1200 members worldwide as our guest along with
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:43.240]  somebody else who really doesn't need any introduction he's been a guest on
[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:47.600]  this broadcast before he's a great lover of liberty former American football
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:51.680]  offensive lineman in the National Football League Mark Stipnowski career in
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:56.480]  the NFL spent with the Dallas Cowboys where he won what two Super Bowls and
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:01.240]  of course five-time pro bowler doesn't get any better than that and it's a great
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:04.400]  having Mark with us but I tell you not only did I grow up in Dallas and a fan
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:08.440]  of the Dallas Cowboys growing up I have to admit now that all I do is fight the
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:11.480]  globalist I can't even really enjoy a football game anymore all I think about
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:16.240]  is this stuff but I'm even a bigger fan of Mark not just for his determination on
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:20.680]  the football field but how that same spirit translates into standing up many
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:25.600]  years ago when it wasn't as popular to talk about 9-11 truth but he saw the
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:30.880]  evidence he did it and the same thing goes for our engineer friend Mr. Zam
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:35.800]  Bode now they're gonna make a big announcement here today Mark Stipnowski
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:41.200]  stepping up to the plate yet again I'm honored that five six months ago they
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:45.840]  launched the building what campaign here on this show and my listeners donated
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:50.120]  the lion's share of the original money to put the building what campaign dealing
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:54.360]  with building seven that nobody knows about on New York TV since then it's
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:58.520]  been covered by hundreds of newspapers dozens and dozens of international TV
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:08.400]  networks Haroldo Rivera has now had Mr. Zam Bode and also one of the fathers of
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:14.480]  someone who died on his show and said that now he sees that 9-11 truth Bob
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:18.640]  McElvaney that now this should be investigated and that he suspicious of
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:22.800]  building seven but even more and this was covered by CNN even this was
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:27.080]  covered by George Soros's people attacking this show and attacking him
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:32.160]  and calling for his firing Judge Andrew Napolitano the co-host of Glenn Beck on
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:37.240]  his TV show the guy with his own show on Fox Business with Lou Dobbs came on this
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:42.440]  show without my prompting a month ago and said the official story of 9-11 is
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:48.480]  impossible and that it should be seen as the JFK assassination as a fraud and the
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:52.640]  system has come after him and you notice he hadn't been fired because this is
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:56.600]  becoming the mainstream view we have major polls like the New York Times
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:01.920]  Angus and Reed were 83% don't believe the official story Kennedy assassination
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:06.560]  polls are upwards of 90% believe the official stories a lie and it's because
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:11.800]  of people's courage like Andres Fambulo the former head of German defense
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:16.000]  coming out and saying it was an inside job the former Italian president coming
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.120]  out the number three in the Japanese government coming out on this show
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:24.520]  saying inside job because of so many family members and prominent people and
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:29.520]  emergency first responders and police officers that survived the evidence is
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:34.360]  coming out six of the 10 9-11 Commission are saying it's all a line of fraud Mr.
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:38.480]  Farmer they had lawyers saying it's a quote criminal cover-up by the Pentagon
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:44.360]  Ventura coming out his show I mean and believe me they've gone through a lot
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.120]  of harassment and intimidation over that Homeland Security trying to shut the
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:51.720]  show down you heard Ventura two weeks ago break the news here that they have
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:56.560]  banned the police state episode I mean this is a big issue and it's about honor
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:01.360]  it's about courage and so Mark Stepnowski do you want to make the
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:05.200]  announcement here on the show today of what you've announced you're gonna do
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:12.520]  this week certainly yeah I've pledged $10,000 to the second round of the
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:17.520]  building what campaign in order to pay to have these commercials appear on the
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:23.680]  air again in New York City so you know hopefully your listeners will respond
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:28.880]  like they did before and be willing to for a little bit of their money into the
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:34.480]  pot and try to do what corporate television won't do and that's show
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:37.920]  this building collapse on TV so that people can get a look at some of them
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:42.720]  for the first time and you know maybe it'll affect their judgment about what
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:48.520]  happened that day now Mark and then I want to get Tony's take on this for
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:51.960]  those that don't know because we're on so many M&F stations there's new folks
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:55.680]  tuning into this for the first time right now what does the building what
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:13:02.920]  campaign deal with why is it called building what deals solely with building
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:11.920]  seven that their tower they collapse on 9-11 at about 5 20 in the afternoon the
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:16.720]  people responsible for this campaign and for getting these television
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:22.720]  commercials on the air if NYC can New York City Coalition for Accountability
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:31.120]  now they attempted a couple years ago to have this issue considered by the City
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:37.760]  Council of New York they wanted to present this issue have witnesses and
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:45.980]  somehow spur a separate investigation by City Council New York and during that
[02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:51.800]  time period when one of the members of NYC can mention building seven while
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:58.760]  addressing the judge for the city his comment was building what because like
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:04.120]  many people apparently he wasn't familiar with that building for the fact
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:10.800]  that it collapsed that day so that kind of in a nutshell crystallizes public
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:15.960]  opinion about this issue and the lack of information and the lack of awareness
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:20.920]  about what happened to building seven so that is how it became the name of the
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:25.640]  campaign well it's beautiful and we're gonna give folks the URL out in a
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:29.880]  moment to the building what website we're also gonna play the original ad but
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:34.200]  mark I'm telling you this this campaign was a lot more successful than I even
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:38.200]  thought it would be when I asked my listeners you know if they believed in
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:42.920]  it to donate to it up front with that original seed money than others joined in
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:48.600]  I wasn't sure it would have any effect at all but I knew that laying down would
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:53.440]  certainly be ineffective I mean what's the old saying that that winners never
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:59.000]  quit and quitters never win or you can say it the other way that you know that
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:04.160]  quitters never win and winners never quit but certainly now it's caused a
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:13.840]  chain reaction BBC RT Al Jazeera Fox CNN and it clearly spurred courage for
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:17.280]  Geraldo Rivera I won't play it again because of time constraints but he said
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:22.800]  wow I've now met with a family who lost their son on these engineers building
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:27.760]  seven very suspicious this needs to be looked into I'm suspicious this is
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:33.040]  legitimate and then the politano on Fox of all places to step up with even more
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:37.120]  courage and now they've tried to get him fired to stand with him I mean you know
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:42.800]  this isn't a game here but I'm really very surprised and very happy at just
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:46.440]  how effective the building what campaign has been so I want to salute
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:52.160]  everybody involved with it and of course you mark and mr. Zamboni and
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:56.680]  everybody else because we're having an effect here and the system's got to be
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:02.080]  scared mark what's your take on that well I agree I think the people at NYC
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:07.000]  can deserve a lot of credit you know they've worked hard on this issue for
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.760]  years they have refused to let this issue die that is mainly come about as
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:17.520]  a result of the dedication of not only the family members the remaining family
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:21.520]  members who are involved with NYC can but all the other institutions and all
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:26.080]  the other groups of people that are involved the firefighters the pilots
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:31.920]  like you mentioned the architects and the engineers former military and
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:38.240]  intelligence people there's a whole lot of credibility behind this movement and
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:43.280]  it's not you know you have all the different areas represented you have
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:47.320]  people whose family members were involved you have people whose background
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:53.200]  involves expertise in these areas everyone who has reason to be skeptical
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:17:00.040]  has joined forces in this group to come together to kind of pierce the censorship
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:04.960]  bubble that has existed around you know the collapse of building seven as you
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:09.520]  mentioned earlier internationally now for several years there has been quite a
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:14.760]  bit of skepticism about the official story of 9-11 and there have been people
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:20.160]  around the world in leadership positions who have spoken out and have
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:26.640]  expressed their skepticism I think fortunately what this campaign has done
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:32.760]  here in New York it's kind of enabled that to happen to a certain extent in
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:40.320]  America because of the the media blackout regarding some of the truths of
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:47.240]  September 11th I think the public and certainly some politicians have been
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:54.440]  slow to react compared to what's going on in other countries but fortunately it
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:18:00.280]  looks like thus far these commercials have served as an impetus to get people
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:05.000]  to kind of shrug off their apathy and address this issue and look at it with
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:10.560]  with new eyes so to speak and you know hopefully try to do something about it
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:16.080]  so it's almost like some big offensive linemen breaking open a hole so that the
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:21.160]  truth that running back and run right through and get a touchdown well that's
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:27.080]  the thing I mean it's when you have the truth on your side it's only a question
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:33.520]  of time before it comes out I mean if you have dedicated people who feel
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:40.120]  strongly about this issue who are not going to go away they have people like I
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:44.720]  said for many reasons a lot of people involved behind this campaign have a lot
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:50.960]  of incentive to see it succeed and fortunately all that dedication and
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:56.480]  years of hard work is yielding some results right now which is very
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:02.840]  encouraging and that's why I continue to be involved because you know in light of
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:07.560]  the effect that this has had everybody who is a part of it would certainly like
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:11.800]  to see it continue well we're going to come back with Mark Stepnowski and of
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:17.320]  course some mechanical engineer Tony Zambodi just absolutely amazing we'll
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:21.320]  also look back at building 7 and why it's so important and the key to exposing
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:25.800]  the cover-up and the fraud that is 9-11 and how 9-11's now been used for the
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:30.720]  naked body scanners the threat fusion centers the police state all these
[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:36.200]  illegal wars and and we're the building what campaign is going next but it's had
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:40.560]  a huge effect and we've never been making this much progress for 9-11 truth
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:46.080]  the system is really scared we'll also talk to Mark and Tony about why they
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:49.080]  have the courage to go public you know why they're doing it I mean I know why
[02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:52.200]  deep down I can answer their question for them because they can't stand
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:56.680]  corruption they can't stand lies they have a sense of justice we'll discuss it
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:00.760]  all with these patriots on the other side stay with us
[02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:04.960]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:08.680]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:12.240]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:16.000]  silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.880]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:24.320]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:29.360]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:33.080]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:36.880]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:41.360]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:48.440]  dot-com that's survival seed bank dot-com or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:56.800]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the
[02:20:56.800 --> 02:21:01.920]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank dot-com gold
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:05.640]  isn't for you Ted Anderson president of Midas Resources one of the world's
[02:21:05.640 --> 02:21:09.400]  premier gold and precious metal investing firms I get it you wouldn't buy
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:13.440]  gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the Fed will
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:17.120]  stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:21.320]  would be there for you that's not what's happening you might even pass on gold
[02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:25.400]  if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't
[02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:29.960]  lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you then
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:33.520]  now is not the time to buy gold or the realists there have never been more
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:38.560]  sobering reasons to diversify with gold since 2001 the US dollar index has
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:43.800]  tanked 30% while gold has risen 300% right now savvy investors are adding
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:48.080]  gold to their portfolios you should too find out what they know call us and I'll
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:56.320]  send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well free 800 686 2237 800 686 2237
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:22:04.920]  that's 800 686 2237 hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:10.040]  century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing
[02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:14.240]  off this agenda that we pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:19.400]  turning members influence on our president in Congress and they really
[02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:24.200]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:28.520]  citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:33.800]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:41.600]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the

[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:30.960]  segment we're gonna hold you guys throughout the hour and I appreciate
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:34.240]  your time I want to play the building what add give out the website it's

[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:49.000]  those that give 10,000 I'm told our listeners gave about 30 the first time
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:53.320]  we did this that sounds like a lot it's not but those few ads in New York because
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:57.400]  the ads effective had a big effect I want to ask you this first Tony before we
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:03.040]  go come back to Mark Stipnowski now what made you as an engineer start
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:09.680]  questioning and what's your whole view of 9-11 well I watched the towers come
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:14.920]  down live at work we were in a design review and we heard that there was a
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:18.320]  person on a second plane hit and a break time of course we're up at a
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:23.060]  cafeteria and we're you know most big companies have calf TVs in the
[02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:28.040]  cafeterias we're watching the towers while they're burning and you know when
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:32.920]  comes down south hour and a half hour later to door tower and I'm just I was
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:36.840]  shaking my head wonder where all the energy came from I'm not saying I was
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:41.480]  just precious it just didn't seem right and coming home from work that night I
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:48.280]  heard about building seven and that just perplexed me and I'm thinking how
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:51.480]  to be right up next to the towers been completely gutted they said there was
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:56.520]  diesel fires that if they couldn't put out but it just didn't seem right you
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:01.320]  know knowing they described the size of the building and in case anybody doesn't
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:04.640]  know most people should know but they really need to think about it I use
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:10.920]  football field mark as an analogy here imagine being on a football field that's
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:15.200]  how big that building was in plan an area each floor is a football field inside
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:21.320]  and he would have a large column every five yards on the perimeter then you'd
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:27.760]  have the same size columns from the 20 yard line to the 20 yard line and then
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:33.360]  three at breath another 24 in the middle and imagine that thing coming down at
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:38.840]  freefall acceleration for 105 feet this thing was 610 foot tall unbelievable
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:42.800]  immense immense and I don't think he kept I don't think people really fully
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:47.320]  appreciate it when they see the film the immensity of this building in most
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:51.760]  cities it'd be the biggest I mean in Austin in Austin it'd be the biggest
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:55.960]  it'd be the second biggest building in Dallas but the same as 33 states it would
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:28:01.360]  be the biggest building okay but it's not just the height Alex it's the the
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:07.760]  immensity the size the football field and width and length and then 610 foot
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:13.040]  tall that's a humongous building it's absolutely immense and for that to come
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:18.200]  down at freefall acceleration it went into was like it went over a cliff and
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:23.000]  it's not moving and all of a sudden boom because of the freefall acceleration
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:28.080]  that's impossible by the way NIST had denied or nine years or eight and a
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:32.040]  half years at the time that there was freefall now they've had to admit there
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:36.160]  was freefall because under Newtonian physics as you know as an engineer it's
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:40.600]  impossible unless they blew it that's right they they and they played a couple
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:45.120]  games first of all they only measured two points they took an average and David
[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:49.320]  Chandler a physicist from California forced them to admit the freefall which
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:53.680]  they admit to as part of it they have this 5.4 seconds that they say their
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:59.080]  model comes down and from the it comes down to the 29 foot of first 18 stories
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:03.040]  you can see and then it's cut off in the view because of the building in front of
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:08.800]  it but they say that first 18 floors came down and 5.4 seconds but in reality
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:13.960]  it was 3.9 so they were 40% over and they did that because that's all they
[02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:17.520]  could get their model to come down and so their model doesn't replicate the
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:22.920]  failure their model never goes into freefall so you know it was it was
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:27.840]  whether it was an attempt at at subterfuge or not it was incorrect and
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:32.400]  they did not replicate the failure and if anybody that's seen and they can't
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:37.040]  see the next model on the building what website their model doesn't look like
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:40.960]  what you see in the video at all and there's tremendous deformation of the
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:45.120]  building at the top it all right Tony stay there Mark stay there we'll come
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:49.960]  right back play the building what had asked folks to donate get into a lot

[02:33:02.320 --> 02:33:09.320]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of
[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:16.720]  tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:23.720]  radio network a lot of people early on when I was talking about 9-11 now they
[02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:26.360]  were planning to blow up the World Trade Center two months before it happened
[02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:29.960]  and then on the day that it happened when I was talking about the control
[02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:35.080]  demolition they said it's so rude it's well I mean the truth isn't rude the
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:39.840]  truth is the truth buying into a fable that is then used to destroy our
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:44.440]  republic and our freedoms and have an iron curtain of tyranny lower down over
[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:50.560]  the planet that is not something that's obviously good for society only the truth
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:58.080]  will set us free and the truth is there are many governments the Russians our
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:04.160]  own that it's been declassified of stage terror attacks and regardless of who you
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:09.080]  think was really behind it we know the official story is a lie is a fraud and
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:16.000]  if we don't expose this fraud then the system is going to continue to use it to
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:20.400]  bring in a new dark age of control talking to Mark Stipnowski mark when did
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:23.000]  you first start I think I first interviewed you like four or five years
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:27.840]  ago but when did you first start to question the official fable of 9-11
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:31.600]  and why did you decide you know a guy who made tens of millions of dollars very
[02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:36.080]  successful successful in business you know you know great family what made you
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:39.400]  decide to take that plunge and do something that you knew that you could
[02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:42.000]  be attacked for
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  I was skeptical of events the day it happened and I don't say that you know
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.400]  to try and sound like a know-it-all in retrospect but I say that because leading
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:59.120]  up to that point throughout my life I'd read a lot about the Kennedy assassination
[02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:07.320]  and the Iran Contra affair and the Mura building blowing up in Oklahoma City I'd
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:13.000]  read a lot about those historical events throughout my life and you had
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.440]  studied them and kind of became aware of the inconsistencies and all those
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:23.240]  stories and how you know what what the truth was was not something that was
[02:35:23.240 --> 02:35:29.640]  highlighted in corporate media so yeah as I watched the events unfold that day
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:36.600]  in 2001 I felt much the way Tony did although admittedly I am no expert and
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:42.880]  don't claim to be but just watching that second tower go down that day looking
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:47.120]  at the television I said to myself that doesn't look like that's from any kind
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:52.440]  of fire you know I mean just even even my lay of myself a lay person right a
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:57.240]  professional football player at the time just logic could tell you by watching
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:02.120]  that on TV that that was an explosion that was a building disintegrating into
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:09.760]  powder in front of your eyes that was obviously not from a fire so my thinking
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:18.800]  was just to wait and see if the system would would correct this issue you know
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:26.040]  as time went on and you'd like to think that any kind of structures within
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:31.000]  government that are built to you know detect and ferret out corruption and
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:35.800]  bring people to justice you'd like to see those mechanisms go into effect and
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:41.600]  it appeared to be that way when the 9-11 Commission was first put together
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:46.840]  although it was obvious with how long it took and how little money was given to
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:50.040]  it that it was never really a serious attempt to get to the bottom of things
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:53.360]  and then once the Commission was finished and the former members spoke
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:57.640]  out that view was cemented and everybody realized that it was just a
[02:36:57.640 --> 02:37:02.280]  cover-up so honestly he's just you know have having the misgivings that I
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:07.960]  originally had and knowing what I knew about previous events where the public
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:13.320]  was not told the truth it got to the point where it became apparent that you
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:18.520]  know certain mechanisms were not going to kick in and the system was not going
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:22.640]  to correct itself it became obvious that this corruption was going to go
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:26.960]  unpunished and that as you said this event was going to be used as a
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:32.040]  pretext for a whole agenda that was put in place you know prior to September 11
[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:37.800]  2001 so I just reached the point where like many other concerns systems who
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:45.360]  have donated far more time and effort than I have after researching the event
[02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:51.360]  reading about it online or in books or going to see people give presentations
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:57.600]  you know speakers who you know don't believe in the official story all this
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:01.040]  kind of added up to me just wanted to do something about it myself just as any
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:06.360]  concerns citizen would do you know if you're somewhere you know you want your
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:10.520]  voice to be heard you want to believe that you live in some semblance of a
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:16.360]  democracy it was just a case of putting my money where my mouth is well if you
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:20.400]  see something say something but it's like this airline pilot sees that the
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:24.560]  airports are wide open for everybody but the pilots and passengers he puts out a
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:28.960]  video they raid his house now there's going to be a congressional
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:33.480]  investigation now the feds are backing off the pilots courage we learn they
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:38.040]  only want us not trusting each other and spying on each other they don't want us
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:44.040]  seeing buildings blown up in front of us to use our own common sense but to use
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:47.920]  the football analogy what which I use a lot not just when I have a two-time
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:54.240]  Super Bowl champion with me I can clearly say now that they were winning nine
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:39:00.360]  years ago about three years ago we began to fight back and started to turn the
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:07.520]  tide but I have to say 9-eleven truth wasn't winning until about the last year
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:13.360]  or so and now this building what building what.org campaign I think has
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:18.400]  really been a game changer mark what's your take on that yeah I agree I think
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:24.880]  it's you know it's a tad a definite impact and that's the reason why the
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:28.600]  people involved chose to continue because they could see that the effect that it
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:32.920]  was having there was certainly getting banged for their buck and they were
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:37.080]  accomplishing what they originally set out to do which was to have this
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:43.120]  demolition shown on TV I believe on the day of September 11th it was shown once
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:48.600]  and never shown again so it's just a case of getting it out there and
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:54.760]  educating the public you know people who have not seen this building go down
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:40:00.160]  who some are not even aware of it can now look back on it with a different
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:06.640]  perspective with maybe a little bit less emotion clouding their judgment now
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:12.840]  they're a little bit removed from that day and can respond and use something
[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:18.360]  more with the logic and less with just gut reaction maybe people be a little bit
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:22.280]  more willing to open their eyes well here's the 64 million dollar question I
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:28.520]  want to throw it to you mark and then of course to the engineer Tony who's here
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:34.240]  with us but not just their overall agenda of global you know militarism and
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:38.000]  takeover that they've gotten through this staged event that Operation Northwood's
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.040]  you know previously discussed where the Pentagon lays out why they want to stage
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:46.360]  big attacks on the homeland to be blamed on foreign enemies if we don't expose
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:51.840]  the favorite tool of tyrants false flag terror that Hitler used in 33 to really
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:56.680]  become a dictator firebombing his own Reichstag if we don't expose this the
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:41:01.400]  system's gonna do more in the future I mean they're not gonna stop unless we
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:07.120]  break their stranglehold on this issue well that's true I mean absolute power
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:11.200]  corrupts absolutely and when you have people who you know they have the
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:16.040]  military hegemony that the US has now throughout the world when you have
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:21.000]  ownership of the corporate media and you can control the message and and sense
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.800]  or any information that might come out and that's what you will get you will
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:32.000]  have democracy being subverted it is up to people like those in New York and
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:38.440]  NYC can and all the groups you know like I said firefighters pilots architects
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:45.120]  engineers when I live in truth is up to those people to be involved in truly what
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:49.600]  is a citizen's movement you know this is I'm proud to be involved because it's a
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:55.160]  grassroots movement you know it's I empathize with the the people that have
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:59.280]  family members die that day that could have been any one of us those people were
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:03.400]  just victims of circumstance and other family members are left with a bunch of
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:07.720]  unanswered questions that could be any one of us if any one of us was in that
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:13.320]  situation we would be doing the same thing you know some people were in a
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:17.400]  sense bought off by the settlement money that was paid out to family the
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:23.040]  remaining family members but there's a small percentage that was not they've
[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:28.480]  continued to fight and to push this issue because they don't want to let it go
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:33.640]  because they know that they're being lied to so it's just like I said I'm
[02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:39.480]  happy to be a part of it and you know sometimes I get the attitude from people
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:43.080]  that hey you know he's just an ex football player what does he know and I
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:47.080]  tell people fine don't believe me don't listen to me because there are people
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:52.760]  far more educated in this area than I am who have every bit as much if not more
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:56.320]  skepticism than I do if you don't want to believe me just because I'm a guy I've
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:59.800]  used to play football that's fine yeah what about the German former German
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:03.560]  defense minister the former head of German intelligence the former Italian
[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:06.960]  president what about all these thousands of architecture engineers what about all
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:11.400]  the police environment I've talked to in medics who heard the building seven
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:14.960]  countdown I mean what about the police on video saying get back they're gonna
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:20.080]  blow up seven I mean it's all right there in front of us and then you get
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:24.560]  into all of the other evidence that's why this building what campaign is so
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:30.320]  important building what dot org we've got it up on screen for prison planet
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:34.680]  TV viewers but before we go back to that I want to play the original building
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:38.120]  what add and and this all started because they were trying to go to the
[02:43:38.120 --> 02:43:42.200]  city of New York to have a ballot initiative for a new investigation
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:46.600]  they're at the city level of 9-11 and their petitions got thrown out and and
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:51.320]  the judge said building what when they brought up building seven so that was
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:56.080]  the genesis of the building what campaign here is the public service
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:44:01.000]  announcement with family members of 9-11 victims here it is I lost my son
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:06.440]  my nephew my son on September 11th 2000 most people don't know that a third
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:11.640]  tower fell on September 11th World Trade Center 747 story skyscraper was not
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:15.440]  hit by a plane although the official explanation is that fire brought down
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:20.200]  building seven over 1200 architects and engineers have looked into the evidence
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:24.680]  and believe there is more to the story bring justice to my son my uncle my nephew
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:29.040]  my son and thousands of others who died on September 11th go to building what
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:34.160]  org building what org and Mark Stipnowski is gonna give ten thousand
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:38.560]  dollars to this he hopes that you will match him I know that I'm gonna give a
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:43.200]  donation today and again I get nothing from this except the truth and a future
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:49.240]  for my children mark doesn't all of this is going for these TV ads I hope you
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:54.120]  will give generously because we have seen a huge effect because this is very
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:57.720]  effective it first it shows building seven falling something most people
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:01.480]  haven't seen the media never wanted to cover it then or afterwards I mean you
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:05.800]  never hear about building seven in the media but it also shows victims now I've
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:10.720]  had some of the heads of the biggest 9-11 victims families on the show I'll
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:16.600]  get them on about other issues with 9-11 and in every case I say what
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:20.640]  percentage of your group believe it's an inside job they say more than half and
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:26.920]  I've been on the streets and had firemen and police shake my hand the majority of
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:32.320]  them I've had commanders salute me when I've been down there the cops know the
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:36.760]  firemen know they know they're not stupid they know that they were told
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:40.760]  that the air was safe to breathe and internally the EPA knew how deadly it
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:46.420]  was I mean they've been fighting for nine years to block health care for the
[02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:52.320]  people down there it's incredible going back to the mechanical engineer Tony's
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:57.400]  embody Tony other points you want to add or that you want to put out here
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:01.680]  today for listeners well I just wanted to say I wanted to repeat what I said on
[02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:07.800]  her auto show that there's an absolute proof you know I tend to try to follow
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:11.280]  and I think with the building what campaign is doing is you know the
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:16.680]  cash principal keep it simple straight forward and building seven does that and
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:21.400]  like I said on her auto it's impossible it's absolutely impossible I can't
[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:25.760]  stress that enough for that building to go in the prefall acceleration in a
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:32.280]  natural way for eight stories eight 13-foot tall stories or 105 feet because
[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:37.360]  when columns in a natural collapse columns without the buckle and when
[02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:40.880]  they when columns buckle there's a minimum resistance it's what we call
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:44.760]  asymptotic you guys probably saw this in school it's when the curve comes down
[02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:50.640]  and never drops down to the x-axis to the next wide graph and in this case the
[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:55.640]  buckling resistance is significant it's not even near zero it's ten that's
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:47:00.000]  25 percent of the intact strength so what I want to say there it's not just
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:03.840]  10 to 25 percent of the resistance because you have a factor of safety the
[02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:08.760]  columns in building seven were three anywhere from three to five was the
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:12.400]  factor of safety in other words they could support a load above them that was
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:17.440]  300 to 500 percent greater than what they actually had on them so when I say it
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:21.960]  retain 10 to 25 percent of its intact strength that means even if they were
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:26.480]  buckling completely scissors folded they could still support a load that was
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:30.680]  30 to 75 percent of the load that was on them that means it can never go to
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:34.880]  freefall it's completely impossible so let's say one level did buckle it
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:42.240]  wouldn't have been symmetrical a b you would have had it collapsing in in chunks
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:47.880]  it would have taken time for each floor to collapse and there's another area that
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:52.680]  I know you can quantify I forget the exact term they use but the pile was too
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:59.760]  short these things had been blown in to manageable sections just like a controlled
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:04.280]  demolition you didn't have a lot of people say that what this tries to say
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:08.320]  is that they had an internal failure on the east side the east penthouse went
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:13.240]  down and that internal collapse progressed from east to west completely
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:16.720]  and then all of a sudden the entire exterior shell was just standing on a
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:21.080]  stone prior that comes down in freefall well that's impossible because they
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:26.120]  and they they try to say Alex said it's a multi-story buckle that's very very
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:29.640]  unlikely to have happened but that complete sheet because those column
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:34.760]  connections on the outside columns were moment-resisting their net the whole
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:39.000]  space is not going to buckle and in addition to that well if the east side
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:43.160]  was coming down inside and the outside and the whole thing can done this why
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:48.680]  wouldn't the east side x perimeter come down before the west side why wait for
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:52.360]  the whole building the whole interior was down before the whole building to
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:55.520]  come down that's not what happened what really happened find that the east
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:59.920]  penthouse came down a little that was dropped for some reason but then the
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:04.880]  whole interior was dropped just a split second and he watched the top the the
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:11.840]  HVAC area the parapet up on top the heat exchangers that area just bits in the
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:14.600]  middle it does a little past the middle of the building then the whole
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:19.760]  exterior drops it goes into a sudden collapse well serve from structural
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:23.600]  engineers I've talked to and then I've seen the Las Vegas implosions with that
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:27.440]  design of a building you want to blow the central columns first so that when
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:31.240]  you blow the others it doesn't fall out damage other buildings you want to leave
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:35.440]  the center so it drags in it just puts a little force on the outside pulls it
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:39.320]  inward a little bit so that everything comes down with a little bit of an
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:43.720]  inward pull and then comes straight down that's exactly why it's done what you
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:48.440]  just said is exactly why beautiful job beautiful job it would have been if it
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:53.840]  was in fact the largest classical or traditional controlled demolition of
[02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:57.440]  history building stuff it was a masterpiece they tried to blow up the
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:00.320]  Intel building here in Austin it was a modern building that never finished
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:04.080]  because Intel had financial problems they built it in 99 blew it up just a
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:09.600]  few years ago and they failed mark I mean again it's just it's hidden in plain
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:13.560]  view mark yeah I'd like to get back to something that Tony said about just
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:20.320]  keeping it simple there's never been a building collapse due to fire ever you
[02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:24.160]  know when you look at what NIST is trying to say and and you know everything
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:31.720]  else they're trying to get people to accept an impossibility it's physically
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:35.960]  impossible you know Tony can back me up on this I'm sure with a much more
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:41.000]  educated opinion but diesel fires that were burning in building seven are
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:46.480]  carbon-based fires a carbon-based fires cannot get hot enough to melt steel it's
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:50.200]  physically impossible you're absolutely right mark stay there final segment man

[02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:11.040]  well it's our last segment we've had so many guests on today coming up when we
[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:14.880]  go into retransmission it's Webster Tarbley Philburg Mike Adams Porter
[02:54:14.880 --> 02:54:22.800]  Stansbury Mark Stipnowski and Tony Zambodi engineer you got cut off by the
[02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:28.640]  break you had another point you wanted to make mark about the magic bullet well
[02:54:28.640 --> 02:54:34.880]  yeah I just as far as you know being told to believe a physical impossibility
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:38.160]  you know the linchpin I'm glad you brought up the Kennedy fascination
[02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:43.720]  because the linchpin of that argument is the magic bullet theory and that's an
[02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:50.200]  absurd theory a bullet cannot behave the way that bullet was described to behave
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:53.640]  so you know if you're gonna believe the official story of the Kennedy
[02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:58.800]  fascination you're asked to believe a physical impossibility and the same thing
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:04.440]  holds true for building seven and nine eleven in general you know a steel
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:09.400]  building has never collapsed from fire if you go online you can see examples of
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:13.240]  other buildings in different countries throughout the world that have burned for
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:18.360]  hours and hours and not come down that's why they build buildings out of steel
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:23.160]  that's why your fireplace is made out of steel because you put wood in there
[02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:29.120]  wood is a carbon-based fire and it can't get hot enough to burn steel so to be
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:35.320]  told that this building just got hot enough from you know diesel fires and
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:41.160]  collapsed it is a modern-day magic bullet theory it's like the magic building
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:45.960]  theory you know I love that the magic building theory asked to believe that
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:51.520]  this thing came down but in reality you know whether it's jet fuel or wood or
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:56.160]  anything that was burning in that building diesel fuel that's a carbon-based
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:56:03.200]  fire and it cannot get hot enough to melt steel it's just impossible let me
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:07.600]  back you up on that the minute mark sure I can if you would the reason a lot of
[02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:11.320]  people say when you tell people fire came out feeling a lot of people don't
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:17.440]  understand why and there's scientifically I just want to say real quick why you
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:21.600]  can melt steel in a blast furnace but that's because you have pure oxygen a
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:29.920]  pure oxygen environment that allows you to get to 3,000 degrees centigrade but
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:36.040]  you're only the byproducts are carbon it's water I think carbon that's carbon
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:41.440]  dioxide molecule or monoxide you're only heating up two additional
[02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:47.800]  molecules which takes energy if you have to heat them up in a in the air you
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:51.480]  have one third of the oxygen you would normally have or a little less actually
[02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:57.680]  and then you also have to heat up several molecules of nitrogen when you
[02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:02.400]  and when you have a fire at the peace flame everybody knows their stove
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:05.920]  doesn't melt when they cook stuff and those flames are blue they're even explain
[02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:08.840]  why you can only get to a thousand degrees centigrade or eighteen hundred
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:12.880]  degrees Fahrenheit because you don't have as much oxygen and you have to heat up
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:17.200]  these other molecules and it's three times more and that's why you can't get
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:21.200]  you can only get one third of the temperature outside of a blast furnace
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:25.160]  and that's why you can't melt steel because it doesn't start to melt so about
[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:28.520]  twenty eight degrees hundred degrees Fahrenheit or fifteen hundred centigrade
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:32.320]  and you can't get hotter than a thousand degrees centigrade or eighteen hundred
[02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:38.240]  Fahrenheit with any carbon fire Tony I hate to interrupt you we're gonna have
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:41.560]  to do I guess five minutes of overdrive I'll let you both go at five after we're
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:44.960]  about to end the official show but most stations carry this next hour but I'm
[02:57:44.960 --> 02:57:49.760]  only going to do five minutes into overdrive like I did yesterday but because
[02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:53.240]  I do want to spend some time but I want you to be able to go back both of you on
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:56.480]  the science of this in the next little segment but now I just want to give the
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:03.800]  website out it's building what dot org and I know I'm putting you on the spot
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:10.400]  Tony is there a phone number for folks that can't give online I don't know one
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:14.440]  right off Alex I can find that out well there's probably one on the website I
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:18.640]  should have asked you that before both of you guys came on but Mark Stepnowski
[02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:23.160]  and Tony Zambati a body can both of you stay five more minutes sure okay
[02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:26.360]  fantastic because I don't want to cut cut you off the middle of your science I
[02:58:26.360 --> 02:58:31.160]  want to be able to also ask Mark about his view of the TSA because that's a all
[02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:36.120]  a extension of 9-11 and then I asked me if you knew about Metallab and the
[02:58:36.120 --> 02:58:40.240]  staged event of course he did so informed back in 60 seconds stay with
[02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:43.360]  this final segment straight ahead America's number one source for
[02:58:43.360 --> 02:58:51.520]  independent talk radio for over a decade we are the GCN radio network very this
[02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:55.040]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:58:55.040 --> 02:58:59.000]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:03.280]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:07.560]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:11.920]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:16.000]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:20.560]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:59:20.560 --> 02:59:24.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:59:24.680 --> 02:59:28.640]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:59:28.640 --> 02:59:32.440]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:59:32.440 --> 02:59:35.160]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[02:59:35.160 --> 02:59:40.440]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[02:59:40.440 --> 02:59:44.880]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the
[02:59:44.880 --> 02:59:51.720]  Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:57.720]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.720 --> 03:00:01.880]  Broadcasting Network
[03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:18.440]  Mark Stipnowski two-time Super Bowl champ and of course five-time pro bowler but
[03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:23.240]  what he's really known for in my book is having a lot of courage just as an aside
[03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:28.840]  we have been contacted over the last five six years by countless former and
[03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:34.920]  current NFL stars mainly NFL for some reason a few basketball players and they
[03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:38.920]  always want to talk to me off air and I'm a busy guy I'm not a hot shot or big
[03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:42.800]  shot but I'm busy but I've called a few and they just want to thank me and buy a
[03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:46.440]  bunch of videos and you know sometimes donate but they're all they're they're
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:50.200]  scared and these are big NFL you know tough guys that I'd be you know scared
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:54.280]  of an alley but they don't have the moral courage to go public like Mark
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:00:58.120]  Stipnowski and that's what I really admire people like Jesse Ventura
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:03.280]  Willie Nelson who are famous they're wealthy they've got a lot to lose but
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:08.360]  they know they've got even more to lose if they don't stand up against this evil
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:11.920]  if this evil isn't confronted it's gonna grow and grow and grow like cancer we
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:15.880]  did find the phone number and that brings up another issue architects for
[03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:23.800]  and engineers for 9-11 truth is helping the operation out of New York with the
[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:28.240]  PayPal on the website building and the infrastructure and five percent of the
[03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:32.200]  donations go to them to fund the infrastructure five percent to first
[03:01:32.200 --> 03:01:38.000]  responders which I think is great and then of course 90% goes to the ad so
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:45.160]  it's building what dot org and that is so exciting please donate today but I
[03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:51.120]  just wanted to bring Mark Stipnowski back and a Tony Sam Bode to just say
[03:01:51.120 --> 03:01:54.280]  closing comments from both of you anything else you'd like to comment on
[03:01:54.280 --> 03:01:59.000]  Mark Stipnowski well I just like to say thanks for having us on I appreciate
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:04.920]  the time to talk about this and obviously anyone who's listening you know I
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:09.240]  would urge them to vote with their pocketbook that's one thing you can do
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:15.000]  nowadays your vote might not count for much as far as the Democratic or the
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:20.480]  Republican Party your vote might not count much if it's made on a computer but
[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:24.280]  if you want to feel like you can actually make it different then vote with
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:29.240]  your pocketbook and try to help get these ads put on TV so that more people
[03:02:29.240 --> 03:02:33.080]  can become educated and we can create further awareness about what really
[03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:39.040]  happened on September 11th 2001 Mark why do you think it's been mainly NFL
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:42.360]  players that have contacted me is it a different breed I haven't really been
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:48.400]  contacted by other sports that's a good question I honestly don't know if I can
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:55.520]  give you a good answer I'm glad to hear it it's nice to know that other guys in
[03:02:55.520 --> 03:03:02.000]  my former profession may feel the same way I do but it's hard to really say
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:06.360]  you know why that is but I'm thankful that that is the case yeah I just wish
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:10.120]  they'd go public you know I mean it's it's it's it's one thing to say hey I
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:13.760]  appreciate what you're doing I know the truth maybe NFL guys have contacted me
[03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:17.280]  because of you I bet you've kind of led the way in that I'm kind of answering
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:20.800]  my own question by the way we did find the number that it's the it's the
[03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:24.600]  architecture engineers for 9-11 truth if you want to donate by phone it's 510
[03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:28.040]  and I'm reading this from 10 feet away guys so make sure I'm saying this right
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:38.280]  510 292 47 10 510 292 47 10 I got a big screen TV across the room they put
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:44.240]  websites up and I'm staring across the hall here but I just want to thank you
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:48.040]  both for coming on we're basically out of time to get into more engineering but
[03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:51.800]  you guys have agreed to come back on together and say you know two three
[03:03:51.800 --> 03:03:55.920]  months to look at phase three of what's going on we've seen phase one big
[03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:59.120]  victory now we're into the second quarter born I'm really doing a lot of
[03:03:59.120 --> 03:04:01.840]  football analogies here and we'll see what happens in the third and fourth
[03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:06.200]  quarter but I just want to salute you all and hope you have a great new year
[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:10.400]  any closing comments Tony I just like to thank Mark for his
[03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:16.600]  articulateness and I'm very impressed and I think that I appreciate you
[03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:21.080]  speaking out from your position mark thanks a lot of guys thanks for being on
[03:04:21.080 --> 03:04:26.360]  the show with me today right I wouldn't I would miss it for the world well it's
[03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:30.440]  like Mark said the truth will come out in the end it was Victor Hugo that said
[03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:34.520]  if you try to bury the truth it will explode with such force later you know
[03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:38.800]  to totally destroy the liars and no army can stop an idea whose time has come as
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:42.400]  Victor Hugo said let me say body you both here during the break gentlemen I
[03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:46.200]  salute you and appreciate everybody especially the listeners who have made
[03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:50.240]  building what dot org TV ad campaign such a huge success
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:55.600]  Geraldo Rivera coming out for 9-11 truth because of it and no doubt Judge Knapp
[03:04:55.600 --> 03:04:59.240]  said the whole thing's a complete fraud we salute those men of courage as well
[03:04:59.240 --> 03:05:05.200]  retransmissions coming up after the break stay with us
