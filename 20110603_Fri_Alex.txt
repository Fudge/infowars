[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:34.840]  it is Friday the third day of June 2011 we're gonna be live here for at least the
[00:34.840 --> 00:40.120]  next three hours and we have the nice folks from the Ministry of Truth the
[00:40.120 --> 00:47.040]  good old MI6 government financed BBC the folks that literally pioneered having
[00:47.040 --> 00:51.360]  trucks driving around picking up the micro signals if you're watching state
[00:51.360 --> 00:55.760]  run television without paying your bill they're here trying to ensure that
[00:55.760 --> 01:01.080]  America becomes just like Big Brother airstrip one and so it's wonderful to
[01:01.080 --> 01:05.480]  have them here today with their conspiracy theory show in fact I have a
[01:05.480 --> 01:10.480]  debated if you could call it that with them fading me down once on BBC radio the
[01:10.480 --> 01:15.400]  director of this program and basically if you question WMD's and the
[01:15.400 --> 01:20.040]  premeditated lies that are confirmed it's a conspiracy theory if you question
[01:20.040 --> 01:24.560]  the fact that Diana wrote letters and made videos saying Charles tells me he's
[01:24.560 --> 01:27.640]  gonna kill me in a fake auto accident doesn't matter of 80 plus percent of
[01:27.640 --> 01:31.000]  the Brits know the truth and many top doctors have gone public it's a
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.760]  conspiracy theory you don't question government and then dinosaur corporate
[01:36.760 --> 01:42.160]  lies you don't do it because they've got a nice throwaway line of conspiracy
[01:42.160 --> 01:47.360]  theory we wave the magic wand of course they said for 40 years Gulf of Tonkin
[01:47.360 --> 01:50.840]  was not staged to get us into Vietnam on the 40th anniversary they
[01:50.840 --> 01:55.240]  declassified the fact that the whole thing had been staged oh sorry but
[01:55.240 --> 02:00.000]  you're still a conspiracy theorist to not like it and if you question why they
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.360]  changed the story of the killing had been laden over and over again it claimed
[02:03.360 --> 02:07.720]  he was in a 45 minute firefight uses wife as a shield and on and on and on they
[02:07.720 --> 02:11.840]  throw the body in the sea if you question any of that even though we had
[02:11.840 --> 02:15.800]  intel nine years before that this was being planned out in the distance that
[02:15.800 --> 02:19.880]  he was already dead and had former high-level State Department and former
[02:19.880 --> 02:25.280]  black op you know commanders on breaking it down nine years ago doesn't matter
[02:25.280 --> 02:30.800]  you don't question a government and a system that lies congenitally over and
[02:30.800 --> 02:34.800]  over and over again now if your neighbor lies to you we need to expand this
[02:34.800 --> 02:39.600]  common sense of your neighbor lies to you dozens and dozens of times about
[02:39.600 --> 02:45.440]  everything you know every time your neighbor watches your house somebody
[02:45.440 --> 02:48.960]  pees on the carpet and you just keep letting the neighbor do it and then
[02:48.960 --> 02:52.040]  finally you walk in one day the neighbors urinating on the carpet and you
[02:52.040 --> 02:55.440]  say well you're the one doing it they said no your conspiracy theorist I mean
[02:55.440 --> 03:00.080]  even when you catch them red-handed that's common sense being gullible not
[03:00.080 --> 03:04.840]  questioning remember for decades it was a conspiracy theory the Federal Reserve
[03:04.840 --> 03:09.320]  was private and had private shareholders it's now all admitted for more than
[03:09.320 --> 03:13.460]  15 years I told you that they would implode the global economy through
[03:13.460 --> 03:17.040]  derivatives and openly announce a new world government run by the private
[03:17.040 --> 03:20.840]  banks that you pay your carbon taxes directly to because we had their public
[03:20.840 --> 03:24.480]  policy reports but those of us that are smart enough to research and read those
[03:24.480 --> 03:30.720]  we're called conspiracy theorists because ABC news BBC and other MSNBC and
[03:30.720 --> 03:34.400]  other secretly government financed and Federal Reserve financed Oregon that's
[03:34.400 --> 03:40.360]  now been leaked thanks to lawsuits and other research if you question that it's
[03:40.360 --> 03:47.120]  a conspiracy theory and they have all told us that we need to learn to trust
[03:47.120 --> 03:51.000]  our government learn to do what we're told and that the and that there is no
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.240]  planetary government being set up but now the planetary government is being
[03:54.240 --> 03:58.440]  announced a private fascist government and in fact the Financial Times of
[03:58.440 --> 04:03.160]  London a couple years ago there was a coming-out party Time Magazine Newsweek
[04:03.160 --> 04:07.800]  The Economist Financial Times Wall Street Journal New York Times in a space
[04:07.800 --> 04:13.480]  of a week they all came out and said world government's real in fact in the
[04:13.480 --> 04:18.880]  Financial Times it said and now for world government and and their editor
[04:18.880 --> 04:23.640]  went on and said yes we kept it secret yes it's authoritarian yes it's
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.440]  planetary yes it's corporate but you're still kooks if you don't like it and it
[04:28.440 --> 04:34.880]  doesn't exist wow that's like Carl Rove a few years ago I told the New York
[04:34.880 --> 04:38.520]  Times he said we control reality now and they said but you did lie about WMD's
[04:38.520 --> 04:43.040]  he said doesn't matter we're history's actors now you just follow what we say
[04:43.040 --> 04:46.840]  and then you will dutifully report whatever new reality we give you so if
[04:46.840 --> 04:50.280]  they tell us that we were never at war with East Asia and the next day we've
[04:50.280 --> 04:54.720]  always been at war with East Asia the BBC will say yes yes yes double plus good
[04:54.720 --> 04:58.400]  and if you question it you're a conspiracy theorist and Cass Sunstein says

[08:33.520 --> 08:37.360]  get in their face that became a national news story our listeners have been
[08:37.360 --> 08:43.240]  pounding Governor Perry's office with thousands of phone calls the Capitol
[08:43.240 --> 08:47.600]  reportedly the media has been basically shut down with phone calls as well
[08:47.600 --> 08:51.920]  great job we got a good chance a forcing Perry who claims he's against the
[08:51.920 --> 08:56.280]  groping and claims he supports the bill will then put it back on the special
[08:56.280 --> 09:02.040]  session agenda he hasn't done that yet so the heat is on and we have Dr. Steve

[09:36.040 --> 09:42.880]  the economic front now that said I don't normally when mainstream media comes
[09:42.880 --> 09:49.200]  in here really get in their face we've had Nightline MSNBC the list goes on and
[09:49.200 --> 09:53.720]  on but I've had the BBC here one of the colleagues of this fellow that's out
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.880]  here now who acted very friendly for the day they were here and then we went out
[09:57.880 --> 10:02.640]  to dinner afterwards and then basically at the end of dinner they were
[10:02.640 --> 10:06.600]  aggressive and and and and you know laughed about what a chump I was and
[10:06.600 --> 10:10.320]  they thought I was a cuckoo and an idiot I already knew that the whole time but at
[10:10.320 --> 10:16.480]  least you could you know point is don't have your little MI6 victory dance you
[10:16.480 --> 10:21.960]  know running around me at the restaurant and the guy who's here today I had a
[10:21.960 --> 10:27.360]  little one-sided debate where they were fading me down on BBC radio and I've
[10:27.360 --> 10:31.080]  seen some clips of some of the shows they produced previously and it's just the
[10:31.080 --> 10:35.920]  standard fodder if you question anything government or big corporate whore
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.600]  media says you are an insane conspiracy theorist and it doesn't work anymore you
[10:41.600 --> 10:48.360]  make fun everybody for many many years over a decade if you don't buy the
[10:48.360 --> 10:53.200]  official story of die of Diana's death of Princess Diana's death eighty plus
[10:53.200 --> 10:56.840]  percent of the brits know it's a complete fraud her letters public the
[10:56.840 --> 11:00.360]  government suppressing it new film coming out totally proving they murdered
[11:00.360 --> 11:04.320]  her it doesn't matter you've lost all credibility now they called a conspiracy
[11:04.320 --> 11:09.240]  theory if you say that the bush premeditated lied about WMD's in
[11:09.240 --> 11:14.320]  Iraq but it's on record that they lied in the White House memo and the Downing
[11:14.320 --> 11:18.760]  Street meant memo premeditatedly it's on record they lied about Gulf of Tonkin
[11:18.760 --> 11:22.760]  to get us into Vietnam for 40 years seeing you were a conspiracy theorist if
[11:22.760 --> 11:26.320]  you talked about it being staged well it turns out there were news articles in
[11:26.320 --> 11:30.920]  Southern California when the ships came back in from the Pacific where officers
[11:30.920 --> 11:35.760]  got off the boat and said nobody attacked us it was staged so see things
[11:35.760 --> 11:40.080]  become conspiracy theories because there's a truth in it but then over time
[11:40.080 --> 11:46.040]  people don't have the original documents and the reality is they would call you a
[11:46.040 --> 11:50.560]  conspiracy theorist from 1913 on if you said the Federal Reserve was private
[11:50.560 --> 11:54.800]  it's now admittedly private its shareholders are secret Alan Greenspan
[11:54.800 --> 11:58.040]  has gone on Larry News Hour and said they're above the law no one can
[11:58.040 --> 12:02.240]  investigate them no one is above the law this is not the right of the bankers
[12:02.240 --> 12:09.000]  as our as our new Imperial Kings pre Magna Carta pre-1215 it's over and so
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.720]  this this trick of the gullible public not so gullible anymore just being told
[12:14.720 --> 12:18.440]  oh trust us yes we've lied to you thousands of times yes you catch us
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.240]  lying all the time yes you catch us breaking the law all the time just
[12:23.240 --> 12:27.200]  you understand it's dangerous to criticize the government the boogeyman
[12:27.200 --> 12:31.520]  will get you if you don't give up all your rights and liberties I remember the
[12:31.520 --> 12:38.720]  BBC when archival footage got leaked onto the web of their reporters on BBC
[12:38.720 --> 12:46.720]  24 and BBC world at the same time reporting building 7 Solomon brothers
[12:46.720 --> 12:50.480]  has fallen into its own footprint CNN also started reporting it but Aaron
[12:50.480 --> 12:53.800]  Brown live in New York turned around he went or that's the report it's right
[12:53.800 --> 12:59.400]  behind him 47-story building government offices in it blew up with blast points
[12:59.400 --> 13:04.120]  falling into its own footprint free fall nift for eight years lied and said
[13:04.120 --> 13:06.720]  there was no free falling down had to admit that they've thrown away the
[13:06.720 --> 13:10.320]  last five fake reasons they say it happened the BBC has had these white
[13:10.320 --> 13:14.000]  wash reports but what did the BBC first do they came out and said that's not our
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.840]  footage then people said of course it's your footage you know look at it on two
[13:17.840 --> 13:21.760]  different channels they said well we lost the tapes oh sure they did of that
[13:21.760 --> 13:25.480]  most famous day on their two big channels internationally they lost the
[13:25.480 --> 13:29.200]  tapes they believe that you believe the Easter Bunny in the and the Tooth Ferry
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.560]  or are real and I said at the time in articles we wrote I said Reuters is one
[13:34.560 --> 13:39.840]  of their main internal feeds openly run with huge connections to CIA MI6
[13:39.840 --> 13:45.760]  Machado EU security pumping propaganda they had a full start just like when
[13:45.760 --> 13:55.360]  they killed Kennedy in in countries in the Pacific Australia other areas they
[13:55.360 --> 13:59.560]  before they'd even captured and before they'd released the name of Lee Harvey
[13:59.560 --> 14:03.840]  Oswald they had the papers back on that they didn't have the internet so papers
[14:03.840 --> 14:07.800]  came out multiple times a day the papers you know extra edition came out Lee
[14:07.800 --> 14:11.880]  Harvey Oswald it's called a false start the intelligence agencies didn't get
[14:11.880 --> 14:16.720]  their whole story straight so see BBC did that they're fed that I said watch
[14:16.720 --> 14:20.120]  it's gonna be Reuters because I went and researched who feeds them and years later
[14:20.120 --> 14:25.120]  it was a Reuters feed that's why we reported it fallen from fires in its
[14:25.120 --> 14:31.640]  own footprint well there you have it expanding on that we now have the CNN
[14:31.640 --> 14:35.200]  footage of the cops saying get back they're gonna blow it up that came out
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.320]  five years out of the archives after I'd interviewed cops that were on that
[14:39.320 --> 14:43.000]  video later when it was released saying they heard the countdown to blow it up
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.560]  but it gets worse I was going to get a piece of that dab and broadcasting all
[14:47.560 --> 14:52.400]  day I heard local ABC and CBS radio reporting they were gonna blow up seven
[14:52.400 --> 14:56.120]  but they said wait no one's gonna buy that blow it up and then say it fell on
[14:56.120 --> 15:00.040]  its own everyone heard it now the NPR tapes of them announcing they blew it
[15:00.040 --> 15:03.760]  up in New York or out Silverstein on PBS saying they gave you order to pull it
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.840]  control demolition and watch the building come down this is the type of
[15:08.840 --> 15:12.680]  information we're talking about now shifting gears to the aftermath of this
[15:12.680 --> 15:18.400]  incredible police state that came after 9-11 this rice-dagging event state
[15:18.400 --> 15:23.920]  representative David Simpson who authored the bill been the main co-sponsor
[15:23.920 --> 15:30.840]  got it into the Senate 138-0 to to make a law against the TSA groping men and
[15:30.840 --> 15:34.200]  women and children's genitals on the outside of the inside I've had district

[15:37.960 --> 15:42.640]  Senate was killed senator Dan Patrick said that the lieutenant governor killed
[15:42.640 --> 15:46.720]  it now the lieutenant governor is under pressure he's asked the governor to put
[15:46.720 --> 15:50.840]  it back on the legislative session this is being watched by the entire world the
[15:50.840 --> 15:55.280]  drudge report is covering this and info wars dot com right now drudge report
[15:55.280 --> 16:00.040]  dot com representative Simpson thank you so much for joining us today sir and
[16:00.040 --> 16:03.720]  congratulations for standing up for what's right and your bold statements
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.880]  about this federal tyranny good to have you back with us well it's good to be with
[16:07.880 --> 16:11.720]  you Alex thank you for having me thank you representative okay break down how
[16:11.720 --> 16:17.480]  do we get this into the special session why is Perry what's the scuttlebutt is
[16:17.480 --> 16:20.720]  the governor who claims he's for the bill going to add it to the special
[16:20.720 --> 16:27.080]  session tell us what's happening well I'm I'm very hopeful that he will I do
[16:27.080 --> 16:33.440]  think I'm very grateful for lieutenant governor doers asking for it in writing
[16:33.440 --> 16:38.920]  to be added to the call right now but the call in the special session is for
[16:38.920 --> 16:44.960]  basically school finance some health care matters and for congressional
[16:44.960 --> 16:51.840]  redistricting but I've asked for this as well in addition to the lieutenant
[16:51.840 --> 16:57.600]  governor and I'm interesting on a teleconference on Wednesday evening or I
[16:57.600 --> 17:03.120]  think it was an evening the governor was asked about the unreasonable
[17:03.120 --> 17:08.160]  grouping searches bills I like to call it or the TSA bill as some others call it
[17:08.160 --> 17:17.240]  and he said that it was his policy school or his group was the looking at it
[17:17.240 --> 17:23.320]  and that he was waiting for consensus and I'm not sure exactly what he was
[17:23.320 --> 17:29.560]  referring to there but we pretty much had a it was it was unanimous coming out of
[17:29.560 --> 17:35.680]  the house and and it was unanimous and the transportation and Homeland
[17:35.680 --> 17:41.040]  Security Committee in the Senate and then we almost had every vote in the Senate
[17:41.040 --> 17:47.120]  until the Department of Justice issued their inaccurate bluffing letter there
[17:47.120 --> 17:51.720]  no fly zone threat to basically have a Libya no fly zone they actually said no
[17:51.720 --> 17:56.720]  planes in around federal blockade exactly we started the civil war yeah I
[17:56.720 --> 18:03.080]  just you know it's just a bluff and we did do something I think it'll help and
[18:03.080 --> 18:11.640]  we made the effective day 90 days after enactment so that it would give time to
[18:11.640 --> 18:16.120]  the state and that hopefully the TSA will revise their procedures their
[18:16.120 --> 18:21.280]  bureaucratic rules I mean there's no congressional statute that allows or
[18:21.280 --> 18:28.400]  requires touching a private part the DOJ's letter was was very misleading
[18:28.400 --> 18:33.800]  and falls that said we were gonna stop all searches it doesn't go that far at
[18:33.800 --> 18:38.080]  all it just says you can't touch someone's private parts without probable
[18:38.080 --> 18:43.800]  cause and they said and unless we touch your private you don't fly that that's
[18:43.800 --> 18:47.440]  that's what's outrageous and by the way there's a new video out of after the
[18:47.440 --> 18:51.240]  woman has been grope she's crying and asking for help and they say look we're
[18:51.240 --> 18:56.280]  gonna grab your genitals in your breast or you don't fly then they threaten to
[18:56.280 --> 19:00.680]  take her son who's videotaping its luggage and then arrest him for daring
[19:00.680 --> 19:06.800]  to get evidence of the molestation yeah a friend of mine represented Brian Hughes
[19:06.800 --> 19:14.080]  told me that one of the members on the PUC was on a flight and they made him go
[19:14.080 --> 19:18.200]  through the scanner and he opted out they started yelling opt out opt out so
[19:18.200 --> 19:24.680]  he endured the so-called pat down which is the euphemism and then after that was
[19:24.680 --> 19:28.400]  over he saw that they were going through his luggage and they were emptying all
[19:28.400 --> 19:36.720]  his you know private parts you know as the top kid what not one by one going
[19:36.720 --> 19:42.080]  through everything in his luggage and he said as for a manager and and he said to
[19:42.080 --> 19:47.520]  the manager you know I opted out but my my bag didn't opt out what why are they
[19:47.520 --> 19:54.040]  going through everything and he asked well am I being punished and the TSA
[19:54.040 --> 19:59.360]  agent our supervisor said yes that's what this is all about now what they do
[19:59.360 --> 20:03.960]  is they get low-grade morons who literally couldn't get a job at McDonald's
[20:03.960 --> 20:08.280]  who were on power trips I mean who else representative would want to stick
[20:08.280 --> 20:13.440]  their hands without you know her obliging in in Miss America's pants who
[20:13.440 --> 20:16.920]  else would want to take diapers off one-year-old babies who else would want
[20:16.920 --> 20:21.240]  to grab the breast of a crying woman and I'm Amarillo and then the men said boy
[20:21.240 --> 20:25.440]  you're hot we'd like a date they just settled the suit with her I mean a lot
[20:25.440 --> 20:32.760]  of these TSA people are out of control goons and you've had your children
[20:32.760 --> 20:36.280]  grope down by these people for opting out of the scanner but now they want to
[20:36.280 --> 20:40.600]  do it on top of the scanner this is really coming to a head and it's
[20:40.600 --> 20:45.160]  transpartisan it's bringing everybody together expanding on this I've had
[20:45.160 --> 20:48.760]  congressman former congressman Bob Barron who runs Liberty Guard he agrees
[20:48.760 --> 20:52.120]  it's a federal power grab about killing the 10th and 9th Amendment it's about
[20:52.120 --> 20:56.880]  breaking our individual will representative David Simpson of Texas
[20:56.880 --> 21:01.920]  who's really been at the front lines the vanguard of this fight how do we
[21:01.920 --> 21:08.320]  pressure Perry because Perry's saying he supported this bill but then Dewhurst
[21:08.320 --> 21:13.040]  reportedly according to Senator Patrick Nick Stipp but didn't want his
[21:13.040 --> 21:17.400]  fingerprints on it now Dewhurst is under major heat does put it into a package
[21:17.400 --> 21:20.960]  of bills and asked for the governor to put that in normally the governor would
[21:20.960 --> 21:24.440]  do whatever that the his Republican counterpart Lieutenant Governor asking
[21:24.440 --> 21:28.160]  to do the leader of the Senate as you know but for listeners and where is
[21:28.160 --> 21:31.840]  Perry I mean how long do we have to get him to add the groping bill the
[21:31.840 --> 21:38.240]  anti groping bill into the special session right he can add it at any
[21:38.240 --> 21:43.240]  point during the special session or even a subsequent one if hopefully we won't
[21:43.240 --> 21:48.760]  have one but you know I think he's a reasonable man and he wrote the book
[21:48.760 --> 21:54.680]  set up this fits with that program I think we should peacefully respectfully
[21:54.680 --> 21:59.600]  you know write letters email and call him and ask him to add it to the call
[21:59.600 --> 22:07.240]  and then you know it with the various senators who had a little trouble
[22:07.240 --> 22:14.040]  standing up to the bed and hopefully this thing will fly through the house
[22:14.040 --> 22:18.720]  in the Senate it's filed senator Patrick filed it in the Senate yesterday I
[22:18.720 --> 22:25.360]  filed in the house that they're identical and it should feel straight to the
[22:25.360 --> 22:29.240]  governor very quickly he just needs that we don't even act you actually have to
[22:29.240 --> 22:35.920]  wait for him to add it to the call until we can continue to work on it but
[22:35.920 --> 22:39.320]  hopefully he'll do that and if he does that I'm sure it would fly through the
[22:39.320 --> 22:43.600]  oh so you're confident he is because if you I'm so I mean I'm a little surprised
[22:43.600 --> 22:48.200]  the governor if he claims he's for the bill didn't put it into his original
[22:48.200 --> 22:54.200]  filing of the bills he called a special session for I mean this is a big litmus
[22:54.200 --> 23:02.160]  test if governor Perry doesn't do this boy his whole fed up time to get the
[23:02.160 --> 23:06.360]  feds out of our lives pro-fourth amendment a statement starts to ring a
[23:06.360 --> 23:12.080]  little hollow and I he hasn't opposed it and he stated that if there was
[23:12.080 --> 23:18.840]  consensus he would support it so that was on Wednesday and his the policy
[23:18.840 --> 23:24.600]  staff are looking at it and hopefully he'll add it shortly and we'll get this
[23:24.600 --> 23:32.080]  done what about with your personal side or your your representative
[23:32.080 --> 23:37.200]  site posting a open letter to the senators that we know got their arms
[23:37.200 --> 23:42.720]  twisted reported that we had 30 of the 31 so it would have sailed through or can
[23:42.720 --> 23:46.040]  you on air give us a list representative Simpson of some of the
[23:46.040 --> 23:51.520]  senators that we need to talk to via personal visits phone calls emails to
[23:51.520 --> 23:57.400]  make sure that they stand up to the feds well there's not that many of them
[23:57.400 --> 24:02.920]  and there's 31 and I don't know what happened on the first time there was a
[24:02.920 --> 24:08.320]  group of 12 of them whose names were submitted to the lieutenant governor who
[24:08.320 --> 24:16.080]  was chairing the meeting at the time and and so then Patrick withdrew the bill
[24:16.080 --> 24:24.720]  amendment next night he almost had the votes actually I think I would just call
[24:24.720 --> 24:31.640]  whoever your senator is or email them and ask for their support I know there
[24:31.640 --> 24:40.640]  were both Republicans and Democrats that didn't stand up to the DOJ when
[24:40.640 --> 24:47.000]  they should have representative we still had a majority though sure sure so we
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.360]  still had a majority so why then did Dewhurst pull it saying he didn't have
[24:52.360 --> 24:57.400]  enough votes well you had it was the name it was really the last day for a
[24:57.400 --> 25:02.560]  bill to be heard and you had to suspend the rule and not only did you have to
[25:02.560 --> 25:06.680]  have a two-thirds vote but on that day you actually had to have a four-fifth
[25:06.680 --> 25:14.520]  vote to suspend the rule to have a bill on second and third reading and so we
[25:14.520 --> 25:18.520]  just ran out of time I think if it had come to the Senate earlier we'd have
[25:18.520 --> 25:23.880]  got the bill passed okay representative Simpson the last time you were on with
[25:23.880 --> 25:31.080]  us from the Capitol you talked about the fact that you've been asking the TSA for
[25:31.080 --> 25:36.240]  their law for their regulation and they can't give it to you the FBI can't
[25:36.240 --> 25:40.400]  randomly grab people's genitals through the pants or inside the pants as the
[25:40.400 --> 25:44.680]  TSA is now doing even to small children and and we're having men grow up little
[25:44.680 --> 25:49.400]  girls and vice versa just unprecedented stuff that even you know Stalin's Russia
[25:49.400 --> 25:55.000]  didn't do publicly but didn't its dungeons so just unprecedented communist
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.720]  China doesn't do anything near this some of the worst even North Korea I've talked
[25:59.720 --> 26:03.880]  to journalists this this isn't done you know to the general public except in
[26:03.880 --> 26:08.640]  special circumstances so this this beyond North Korea situation that they're
[26:08.640 --> 26:12.600]  just throwing in our face arrogantly I've had district attorneys on they've
[26:12.600 --> 26:16.400]  said that there's already laws in Texas there's already laws in California that
[26:16.400 --> 26:21.160]  that a cop can't do it a state police a fed and and and so you've continued to
[26:21.160 --> 26:25.760]  ask these I mean why not just have the state put out a resolution calling for
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.400]  district attorneys and state police to go do stakeouts we know crimes are being
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.880]  committed and start clapping these feds in irons well it's a little more
[26:35.880 --> 26:42.000]  complicated in the sense that when you buy your ticket and the fine print you
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.200]  know the six to four point is a contractual thing so kind of like you
[26:45.200 --> 26:50.120]  can go to Nevada and sign a contract to visit a prostitute things that would a
[26:50.120 --> 26:55.880]  lot of times be illegal or legal under contract well and basically people you
[26:55.880 --> 26:59.200]  know that we're not leaving them any alternative either you get ogled or
[26:59.200 --> 27:04.520]  broke if you go to if you if you don't go through the metal detector and to me
[27:04.520 --> 27:07.520]  if you don't want to go through the scanner they ought to send you back to
[27:07.520 --> 27:12.320]  the metal detector I work so we're only talking about three percent of the
[27:12.320 --> 27:18.320]  people and it's it's um I mean that's way too many to grow for to view
[27:18.320 --> 27:21.160]  virtually strict search well representative we're almost out of
[27:21.160 --> 27:25.320]  time but I've flown a lot and and they're lying when they say three percent
[27:25.320 --> 27:28.840]  when they've got them on and going it's mainly women and children I've seen it
[27:28.840 --> 27:32.720]  over and over again and they do the and this is now admitted in many cases the
[27:32.720 --> 27:37.800]  scan and the grope so so so this so so they're putting out this hoax that well
[27:37.800 --> 27:41.960]  do the scanner and we won't grope you in fact they've admitted the TSA and the
[27:41.960 --> 27:47.040]  Chicago Tribune wants everyone in the future to be scanned but but but but my
[27:47.040 --> 27:52.240]  point is take topless bars in Texas we've got big issues reportedly in the
[27:52.240 --> 27:56.920]  VIP area with women touching on the men and vice versa just because
[27:56.920 --> 28:00.920]  contractually you go in there looking for that doesn't mean it's legal so they
[28:00.920 --> 28:05.560]  can say contractually we're allowed to grope you but but I mean a contract
[28:05.560 --> 28:12.040]  doesn't allow crimes to be committed yeah and the bottom line is is we're
[28:12.040 --> 28:16.240]  allowed to do it and we just need to say you know we're not gonna fly if you're
[28:16.240 --> 28:20.440]  gonna have to touch me in my private parts without probable cause there's a
[28:20.440 --> 28:27.080]  great quote by CS Lewis in 1948 he said of all tyranny a tyranny sincerely
[28:27.080 --> 28:32.480]  exercised for the good of its victim may be the most depressive and I think he
[28:32.480 --> 28:38.560]  is right on and the name of fighting terrorism work that our government is
[28:38.560 --> 28:42.640]  doing what the terrorists could never do and then removing the dignity and
[28:42.640 --> 28:49.240]  freedom of innocent travelers every day at the 10 of at least 60,000 people out
[28:49.240 --> 28:53.720]  of 2 million it's just it's not a reasonable it's we need to stop it we
[28:53.720 --> 28:59.520]  need to stop submitting to it and just and look for other ways to secure our
[28:59.520 --> 29:06.440]  travel absolutely well representative David Simpson with district 7 thank you
[29:06.440 --> 29:10.120]  so much for spending time with us in the 30 seconds we've got left what else can
[29:10.120 --> 29:15.680]  we do to ensure that Texas the Lone Star State stands up to this tyranny how
[29:15.680 --> 29:18.960]  do we get that bill passed just just just absolutely call the senators and call
[29:18.960 --> 29:24.680]  Perry that's right and I would also call the speaker of the house I would call
[29:24.680 --> 29:29.760]  all your representatives and then I'd also call your US representative and
[29:29.760 --> 29:34.880]  senator and ask them to support this on the federal level well that's the good
[29:34.880 --> 29:39.000]  news they just cut 270 million out of TSA and they're moving to try to remove the
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.680]  scanners at the congressional level representative David Simpson thank you

[33:52.560 --> 34:00.760]  document Senate judicial watch sued and got them in 2007 and it says thousands
[34:00.760 --> 34:04.640]  of pages we must keep the public in the dark about this we're gonna pass the
[34:04.640 --> 34:08.560]  carbon taxes to fund our private corporate takeover they had Fortune 100
[34:08.560 --> 34:12.520]  we have the minutes of it there were the leaders of the bureaucracies from the

[34:18.560 --> 34:24.600]  bowing to them and they talk about North America integration by stealth then
[34:24.600 --> 34:29.440]  Bush came out and this is also an end game on C-span with Merkel and Baroso of
[34:29.440 --> 34:33.320]  Europe the head of the EU at the time Baroso the head of Germany Merkel and
[34:33.320 --> 34:41.760]  said we are now merging the American Union with the European Union remember in
[34:41.760 --> 34:50.000]  2007 they had the 50th anniversary of the EU Treaty of Rome just like in 2005 the
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.680]  North American Union was established at Baylor but you talk about this the media
[34:54.680 --> 34:59.240]  calls you a conspiracy theorist they they ran Lou Dobbs out of CNN because he
[34:59.240 --> 35:04.160]  would cover this oh WikiLeaks national post big paper of Canada the
[35:04.160 --> 35:07.320]  integration of North American economies would best be achieved through an

[36:44.240 --> 36:49.040]  fascism they say we want fascism they say the public's too dumb to accept our
[36:49.040 --> 36:54.240]  tyranny so we'll just do it what did the foreign editor at the finance times of
[36:54.240 --> 36:57.360]  London right in his article and now for world government he said yes we're
[36:57.360 --> 37:01.960]  secret yes we're authoritarian and yes it's good and you bet we're militarized
[37:01.960 --> 37:06.120]  and in this world is ours and we're coming for it and you cattle are gonna
[37:06.120 --> 37:12.520]  lay down and take it haha they love it well I got news for you some of us are
[37:12.520 --> 37:18.040]  still red-blooded now this woman had a normal reaction they having people grab
[37:18.040 --> 37:22.480]  and grab at her breast and in other areas her son video taped it and so they
[37:22.480 --> 37:26.200]  arrested him reportedly we're gonna talk to him right now and threatened to take
[37:26.200 --> 37:31.120]  his bags and we're gonna play part of that clip here in a moment but now we go
[37:31.120 --> 37:37.080]  to the son of the lady Ryan Nicholas joining us sir tell us where you live
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.320]  where you're located what airport we have in our article but a breakdown where
[37:42.320 --> 37:45.920]  and how this happened and obviously a short video clip with them in your face
[37:45.920 --> 37:51.600]  can't capture all of what happened break it down for us mr. Nicholas well I'm a
[37:51.600 --> 37:55.400]  resident here out in Phoenix Arizona and the event you saw in the video took
[37:55.400 --> 38:00.000]  place at Sky Harbor International Airport here in Phoenix and basically we
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  went through the screening process and the mom was you know suggested to go to
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.320]  the body scanner and because my family knows the adverse effects of the body
[38:09.320 --> 38:13.800]  scanner and don't want to subject our naked images to other people we always
[38:13.800 --> 38:17.880]  opt out usually it's my father myself that gets you know flagged for this but
[38:17.880 --> 38:22.240]  then the first time a mother went through and you saw the aftermath of the
[38:22.240 --> 38:26.360]  horrific event that took place which is left turn the position to never want to
[38:26.360 --> 38:30.720]  travel again by airplane and of course Obama made the joke in a state of the
[38:30.720 --> 38:34.280]  Union that don't worry you can ride the trains and not be scanned or grope now
[38:34.280 --> 38:38.680]  they're moving out to the trains high school proms total federal power grab
[38:38.680 --> 38:43.120]  now now we only see once she's begging for a police officer who comes over and
[38:43.120 --> 38:47.600]  basically helps the tyranny you know don't call for an officer in the modern
[38:47.600 --> 38:52.600]  America with a K wound homeland no things have changed here we're an empire now as
[38:52.600 --> 38:57.320]  Carl Rove said an imperial bloodthirsty empire that's that sucked up the
[38:57.320 --> 39:02.200]  Republic going back break down what happened to your mother before you got
[39:02.200 --> 39:07.600]  the cell phone camera on well she was ahead of me in line she went through and
[39:07.600 --> 39:10.240]  they you know opted out for the body scanner instead I'd rather have you know
[39:10.240 --> 39:13.680]  go through the path down they had actually gone through the majority of the
[39:13.680 --> 39:18.120]  path down they just had the front upper part of her body to you know grope
[39:18.120 --> 39:23.140]  basically and she said at that time before you do that I want to follow
[39:23.140 --> 39:27.320]  complaints I do not want you to touch me there and the woman proceeded to do so
[39:27.320 --> 39:33.160]  and I was able to get my phone out of my bag just in time to catch what had
[39:33.160 --> 39:37.640]  happened just after that statement was made she then you see it's very
[39:37.640 --> 39:42.320]  hysterical crying for police officers to help and I think that what was caught on
[39:42.320 --> 39:47.840]  the film was what it's breaking the illusion that the police are a higher
[39:47.840 --> 39:52.200]  superior than TSA TSA obviously have more security than our our own police
[39:52.200 --> 39:58.160]  officers because you know TSA they have they don't have to live up a lot of
[39:58.160 --> 40:02.480]  fight by the Fourth Amendment and this is an indoctrination zone breaking our
[40:02.480 --> 40:06.760]  will training us for the force inoculations and the warrantless
[40:06.760 --> 40:11.320]  blood draws that are now unfolding nationwide that is so walk us through it
[40:11.320 --> 40:17.280]  up to the point the cameras turned on so so they choose her for the microwave
[40:17.280 --> 40:21.920]  oven machine which the TSA has now been caught faking the calibrations even
[40:21.920 --> 40:25.320]  New York Times admits 20 to 50 times the radiation top scientists say it's
[40:25.320 --> 40:28.920]  dangerous but they just wave a magic wand and don't even do the federal law
[40:28.920 --> 40:32.680]  radiology test every month because they're government and if you don't like
[40:32.680 --> 40:36.160]  the radiation your conspiracy theorist for questioning so they just just like
[40:36.160 --> 40:39.920]  our US governments raised safe levels of radiation because of Fukushima they
[40:39.920 --> 40:43.920]  just raised the level in milk and food they say is safe they wave the magic
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.120]  wand and say be quiet conspiracy theorist just like eight months ago they
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.280]  called us a conspiracy theorist in the media for saying they were patting the
[40:51.280 --> 40:54.920]  outside of the pants and going inside the pants later had to admit that when
[40:54.920 --> 40:58.320]  it was caught on video nationwide but still we're a conspiracy theorist though
[40:58.320 --> 41:03.320]  even though we were right again but going back here describe exactly what
[41:03.320 --> 41:10.200]  happened you how this unfolded well what you didn't see in the video because my
[41:10.200 --> 41:13.440]  phone shut off between the time when they told me to relieve the area in the
[41:13.440 --> 41:17.480]  time when I click back on when I relieve the area my several TSA agents
[41:17.480 --> 41:21.880]  actually approached me my father my mother and they repeatedly tried it to
[41:21.880 --> 41:25.560]  attempted to say that we were you know staging this event that were hired
[41:25.560 --> 41:31.840]  actors basically trying to just be the humanize us and take away from the
[41:31.840 --> 41:38.240]  actual atrocity that's taking place my mother you know I wish I had that on
[41:38.240 --> 41:42.400]  camera but unfortunately I just have it steered in my memory well that's
[41:42.400 --> 41:47.000]  standard they do dehumanize you they say everybody loves having hands stuck
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.720]  down their pants miss America shouldn't mind that they went in her panties and
[41:50.720 --> 41:54.400]  into her body Jesse Ventura shouldn't mind and I've witnessed in them
[41:54.400 --> 41:58.320]  grabbing his genitals and seeing what they are and it's confirmed they they
[41:58.320 --> 42:02.920]  put pressure to ascertain you should like a man walking up and grabbing your
[42:02.920 --> 42:06.760]  genitals and squeezing you should like them running their hand into the crevice
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.920]  of your anus as Jesse Ventura's lawsuit states Ron Paul the congressman should
[42:11.920 --> 42:16.200]  like his genitals being grabbed the state rep we had on when they groped his
[42:16.200 --> 42:20.000]  little daughters and the big freak out at the Texas airport he should love it
[42:20.000 --> 42:27.200]  see you're an actor you're not a real person Mr. Nicholas you you don't have
[42:27.200 --> 42:31.520]  rights you should love it you're fake you're a conspiracy theorist you don't
[42:31.520 --> 42:35.280]  exist it's not real so they came up and they got around you with a little
[42:35.280 --> 42:40.840]  brainwashing please continue well at that point basically you know I
[42:40.840 --> 42:44.360]  repeatedly said you know that this is not the case and they asked me you know
[42:44.360 --> 42:47.600]  who do I work for and I'm not going to tell them that I'm self-employed and you
[42:47.600 --> 42:51.520]  know what my business name is that's none of their concern what they proceeded
[42:51.520 --> 42:56.760]  to do what was they tried to tell me that my luggage was left too far away and
[42:56.760 --> 43:00.600]  that they were going to get a Leo law enforcement officer to come over and take
[43:00.600 --> 43:04.760]  my baggage forcefully from me while I was waiting for my mother to go through
[43:04.760 --> 43:09.800]  the process that's right animal you don't you don't wait for your mother while
[43:09.800 --> 43:16.120]  she's crying how dare you try to stay with your mother are you al-qaeda
[43:16.120 --> 43:21.880]  nowadays up and down left is right you know so all right so the potbellies are
[43:21.880 --> 43:25.800]  running around doing their thing your mother starts to cry continue as she's
[43:25.800 --> 43:29.600]  going through that she's crying my father comes over and tries to you know
[43:29.600 --> 43:34.080]  console her and you know ask what is what needs to be done so we can go
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.560]  ahead and finish and ask them to you know not perform that type of invasive
[43:38.560 --> 43:42.600]  procedure any further since they had already you know broke her made her cry
[43:42.600 --> 43:49.240]  at that point they continued to insist to further breach her privacy by
[43:49.240 --> 43:54.320]  continuing to want to further search her upper body and she basically said no I
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.280]  don't I don't want this I want a police officer now because I want somebody to
[43:58.280 --> 44:02.080]  here to protect me the police officer is supposed to protect us and people joke
[44:02.080 --> 44:06.720]  and say a middle-aged woman should enjoy having their breasts grabbed and we've
[44:06.720 --> 44:10.560]  all seen the videos where they squeeze them to ascertain what they are now
[44:10.560 --> 44:14.480]  now this is the double thing when government does it it's good but if a
[44:14.480 --> 44:18.440]  man came up to your mother and grabbed her breast in a park there'd be police
[44:18.440 --> 44:23.520]  helicopters attempted rape on the news the guy would get 10 years in prison but
[44:23.520 --> 44:27.680]  when they do it it's like hey lady you ought to enjoy it I've seen some of that
[44:27.680 --> 44:32.440]  in the news absolutely it's um it's really frightening to see where this
[44:32.440 --> 44:36.680]  country's mindset is going because to say that it's acceptable is just
[44:36.680 --> 44:41.120]  complete you know intellectual bankruptcy on the individuals part that that says
[44:41.120 --> 44:45.080]  those sort of things because this is just too invasive you you don't have the
[44:45.080 --> 44:48.600]  right to grow somebody the way you do you know without probable cause without a
[44:48.600 --> 44:52.240]  warrant what about sexual assault victims this is very traumatic for them
[44:52.240 --> 44:56.440]  absolutely and that's kind of what I've been trying to make the point to a lot
[44:56.440 --> 45:00.320]  of people you know what happens to these these women that have been sexually
[45:00.320 --> 45:03.880]  assaulted and you know they don't say anything they grind their teeth but are
[45:03.880 --> 45:07.480]  subjected to the horrific memories of what had happened in the past and
[45:07.480 --> 45:10.360]  reliving them as they're going through the process it's just it's just
[45:10.360 --> 45:14.040]  unbelievable that they would allow this sort of thing to happen. My children will
[45:14.040 --> 45:17.640]  be listening to me on the radio sometimes my wife lets them on the
[45:17.640 --> 45:22.080]  subjects aren't too hardcore or when I'm driving in the car I'll have news radio
[45:22.080 --> 45:27.080]  on and and and they'll hear about the lawsuits and people trying to pass laws
[45:27.080 --> 45:31.800]  and then the congressman getting angry and and and all of this going on in the
[45:31.800 --> 45:36.360]  whole world marveling and over 20 billion a year of Europeans and others
[45:36.360 --> 45:39.120]  won't come here because they're like this is not normal have you grabbed my
[45:39.120 --> 45:43.000]  genitals and they're like why everyone does it it's it's totally normal all
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.080]  this insanity is going on and my children say my my eight-year-old my six-year-old
[45:47.080 --> 45:52.000]  well now seven and my three-year-old they'll say daddy you said stranger danger
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.400]  don't let them touch me so what they're training you to do is basically let the
[45:56.400 --> 46:01.240]  government people molest you and I have to say no children governments go bad
[46:01.240 --> 46:04.960]  in history more often than not just like in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia that
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.000]  I've taught you about and and we've got a very bad government right now that's
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.720]  openly trying to overthrow the fourth amendment second amendment and we go
[46:12.720 --> 46:16.280]  over those those issues and go over history with them and they understand
[46:16.280 --> 46:20.360]  they understand that not everyone in a uniform is bad but that the bad men have
[46:20.360 --> 46:24.440]  taken over the federal government and that the foreign banks have captured the
[46:24.440 --> 46:28.400]  U.S. through the private corporate imperium and they now understand it when
[46:28.400 --> 46:32.400]  we say that's why you can't fly on airplanes we can't let those bad men do
[46:32.400 --> 46:36.920]  that to you and that's just what it's come down to in America so continuing
[46:36.920 --> 46:43.080]  how did this how did this progress well after the event you see where my father
[46:43.080 --> 46:48.320]  and I leave the security area to go find my mother she was crying hysterically
[46:48.320 --> 46:52.160]  and went down to the main Southwest airline desk and filed formal complaints
[46:52.160 --> 46:58.920]  for them and the TSA we were originally getting ready to go to Lake Tahoe and my
[46:58.920 --> 47:02.080]  father and I decided that you know we'd go ahead and continue on our way my
[47:02.080 --> 47:06.280]  mother was in no way sure for me going to continue to fly so when my father and
[47:06.280 --> 47:11.400]  I went back to the process basically every TSA agent in the entire area knew
[47:11.400 --> 47:16.320]  we were obviously for what just happened and they just eyeballed us the whole
[47:16.320 --> 47:21.720]  time forced my father myself to be subjected to a full path down and you
[47:21.720 --> 47:26.640]  know when we go through that process we handle ourselves in such a way where the
[47:26.640 --> 47:33.200]  verbal the verbal retaliation that we give them to the physical assault that
[47:33.200 --> 47:37.400]  they give us is definitely justified for some of the things we say to them
[47:37.400 --> 47:41.360]  there's point out what are you telling me of this is sexual assault you're gonna pay
[47:41.360 --> 47:45.920]  for your crimes one day you're a sick pervert why'd you take this job you must
[47:45.920 --> 47:50.560]  enjoy it well one thing that we've seen is that the majority of these guys they
[47:50.560 --> 47:53.520]  don't really like to do what they do because when we do confront them and
[47:53.520 --> 47:58.480]  say you got this job because you like to funnel other males you know and we we
[47:58.480 --> 48:01.440]  say those statements because you want them to understand that what they're
[48:01.440 --> 48:05.440]  doing is wrong and that what we feel is being is a complete violation of our
[48:05.440 --> 48:10.600]  individual rights and any way we can to speak out against some of them don't
[48:10.600 --> 48:14.800]  like it but but but but but you're psychologically missing what with the
[48:14.800 --> 48:21.240]  key they don't like it when you stand up to them it it loses the fun that's why
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.160]  when a woman starts shaking and crying they really get excited I've seen the
[48:25.160 --> 48:30.360]  psychology when cops break pro-lifers arms a part of torture compliance federal
[48:30.360 --> 48:33.240]  courts have ruled for 25 years they can do it I have video of it my film
[48:33.240 --> 48:38.480]  martial law 9-1-1 rise the police state that after they break the arm and they
[48:38.480 --> 48:43.160]  see the bone stick out a wolf instinct a predator instinct and they swarm them
[48:43.160 --> 48:47.240]  with billy clubs as the priest or whoever lays there and they and they just
[48:47.240 --> 48:51.560]  start the blood orgy so it's more of a Nazi blood cement type thing so the fact
[48:51.560 --> 48:56.640]  that you stand up to them that takes the enjoyment away sorry go ahead see see
[48:56.640 --> 48:59.600]  that's why the predators really like kids because they can panic them and the
[48:59.600 --> 49:03.920]  kids cry and they psychically feed on it I'm sorry go ahead no you're you're
[49:03.920 --> 49:09.880]  right and you did see that several TSA agents do get such enjoyment so they
[49:09.880 --> 49:14.040]  they have this power trip mentality and you can clearly see that especially in
[49:14.040 --> 49:18.320]  the women that approached me to tell me to turn my camera phone off they they
[49:18.320 --> 49:23.080]  definitely had some control issues and I think that that's what happens here is
[49:23.080 --> 49:26.680]  when they go through these TSA screenings to get a job with them when
[49:26.680 --> 49:30.080]  they do the psych evaluation I think that they intentionally pick out people
[49:30.080 --> 49:34.360]  that are you know kind of have control freak issues well you're right we've
[49:34.360 --> 49:38.440]  gotten government documents confirming that the main reason they test nerve
[49:38.440 --> 49:43.200]  gas on troops in England in the US and kill them are biologicals on troops or
[49:43.200 --> 49:48.080]  radiation on troops or over 4,000 US school children grabbed from their
[49:48.080 --> 49:52.760]  parents foster kids and others radiated to death all declassified or why do they
[49:52.760 --> 49:56.440]  order the UN to give in every major country they operate in live polio
[49:56.440 --> 50:02.280]  shots to the kids they're building cadres armies of people that enjoy it and
[50:02.280 --> 50:05.560]  that's what the TSA is that's why they've admitted it's gonna roll out
[50:05.560 --> 50:09.440]  nationwide is this is an army of people that whether they do it because they're
[50:09.440 --> 50:14.200]  perverts or control freaks or just idiots they they will do whatever they're
[50:14.200 --> 50:18.840]  told this is the brown shirt army that the federal government has been
[50:18.840 --> 50:24.040]  pushing for absolutely I agree heartily with that and it's sad that most
[50:24.040 --> 50:28.360]  Americans don't recognize that or if they do recognize it unwilling to step
[50:28.360 --> 50:31.240]  up to the plate and stand on their own two feet and say hey you know if this is
[50:31.240 --> 50:34.560]  long and I'm not gonna take it anymore this needs to stop well Ryan you're

[54:20.320 --> 54:26.040]  I get very angry about this because I've studied it I remember Governor Ridge
[54:26.040 --> 54:29.760]  almost nine years ago in C-SPAN admitting they would roll out to the
[54:29.760 --> 54:35.440]  streets the highways the the bus terminals the total takeover now the TSA is
[54:35.440 --> 54:39.880]  making unions get authorization to even have jobs now they're making the 9-11
[54:39.880 --> 54:43.480]  victims the police and firemen go through a terror check to finally get
[54:43.480 --> 54:48.240]  health care you don't believe me just it's in New York Post AP this is a total
[54:48.240 --> 54:52.640]  takeover of society and we're not just saying army of brown shirts because it's
[54:52.640 --> 54:59.280]  a nice verbal flourish this is admitted and what scary is as good people leave
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.560]  the TSA the more and more it's nothing but the crazies now you've got the floor
[55:04.560 --> 55:10.080]  Ryan Mikolas who shot the video your mother breaking down after the groping
[55:10.080 --> 55:14.800]  run from from from the start to the end in about four minutes through what
[55:14.800 --> 55:20.480]  happened uninterrupted okay well when we went to the process of the screening
[55:20.480 --> 55:23.920]  process to get on an airplane and Sky Harbor International Airport we were
[55:23.920 --> 55:28.880]  put in the line and my mom was opted chosen I wanted to say people you go
[55:28.880 --> 55:32.440]  through the body scanner she said no I did not want to go through that I said
[55:32.440 --> 55:36.040]  okay well we're gonna go ahead and take you and do a a pat down you know it's
[55:36.040 --> 55:39.040]  great in the screening area or they go and put you out in front of everybody
[55:39.040 --> 55:42.440]  for you know saying no to them and try to make an example of you so that away
[55:42.440 --> 55:47.560]  others won't say no but what they did was they ended up going to the screening
[55:47.560 --> 55:53.040]  process patting her down her legs her rear her buttocks her arms across the
[55:53.040 --> 55:56.560]  shoulders and whatnot and the last seconds before they were going when they
[55:56.560 --> 56:00.320]  told her they're going to grow per breast she said I would like to follow
[56:00.320 --> 56:05.280]  personal complaint before you go ahead any further with this and when they said
[56:05.280 --> 56:08.720]  no they basically ignored her they didn't say no excuse me they just ignored
[56:08.720 --> 56:13.320]  her request they went ahead and proceeded further into groping her at that
[56:13.320 --> 56:16.960]  point is when I was able to get my camera phone out of my luggage which had
[56:16.960 --> 56:20.920]  gone through the LLX ray machine I pulled it out hit record as fast as I
[56:20.920 --> 56:26.280]  could and you see the event that took place there what happened afterwards was
[56:26.280 --> 56:31.560]  she was still crying pleading for police officers to come assist her and to stop
[56:31.560 --> 56:36.440]  the elestation that was taking place my father was allowed to stay over there
[56:36.440 --> 56:40.280]  because he wasn't recording they just had a big problem with me recording the
[56:40.280 --> 56:44.080]  event and they repeatedly told me over and over again that you cannot record
[56:44.080 --> 56:48.560]  here which is a lie and I caught them in that repeatedly repeatedly saying that
[56:48.560 --> 56:51.880]  gentleman from Southwest Airlines came over and said that you're not allowed to
[56:51.880 --> 56:56.320]  film here they had he had actually said that he would like to have me arrested
[56:56.320 --> 57:01.880]  the TSA woman when I was 10 feet away from my bag said that she's gonna get a
[57:01.880 --> 57:07.320]  Leo law enforcement officer to have my luggage confiscated because I was not
[57:07.320 --> 57:12.840]  attending the luggage and it was unattended luggage from there you know I
[57:12.840 --> 57:16.880]  was I was subjected to further search as well as we went through the process
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.680]  again once my mother left and refused to continue on the fly she went down
[57:21.680 --> 57:26.120]  file complaints TSA and Southwest Airlines my father and I went to then
[57:26.120 --> 57:31.040]  went ahead to get on our plane to go to our destination and from there what we
[57:31.040 --> 57:35.160]  did was we went through the process they saw who we were and immediately said
[57:35.160 --> 57:39.080]  going to the body scanner we immediately said no we are not and they then
[57:39.080 --> 57:45.720]  subjected us to Pat down we got on the airplane and went to Lake Tahoe one
[57:45.720 --> 57:50.240]  comment I'd like to make is that and Lake Tahoe the airport for Reno Lake
[57:50.240 --> 57:54.320]  Tahoe they don't have body scanners they don't have invasive screening
[57:54.320 --> 57:58.800]  processes they have canines bomb sniffing dogs in the airport which are have
[57:58.800 --> 58:03.000]  been proven to be far more effective in threatening any quote-unquote terrorism
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.840]  because they're used you know in the military in Afghanistan and Iraq which
[58:06.840 --> 58:12.040]  this isn't about being effective it's about training you that some swab is
[58:12.040 --> 58:15.680]  gonna grab your mother's genitals right right and I just wanted to make the
[58:15.680 --> 58:19.960]  point that the you know Michael Schurtoff makes millions of dollars
[58:19.960 --> 58:27.240]  having these rapid scan machines there it's really a big scam and Ryan can you
[58:27.240 --> 58:30.480]  stay five more minutes were one minute break I want you to be able to finish
[58:30.480 --> 58:35.160]  up okay we'll be right back second hour straight ahead time flies when you're
[58:35.160 --> 58:38.760]  fighting tyranny but you're not allowed to have an opinion that's called a
[58:38.760 --> 58:50.720]  conspiracy theory this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is
[58:50.720 --> 58:54.080]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[58:54.080 --> 58:58.080]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[58:58.080 --> 59:02.320]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[59:02.320 --> 59:06.600]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.600 --> 59:10.960]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:10.960 --> 59:15.040]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:15.040 --> 59:19.600]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.600 --> 59:23.720]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.720 --> 59:27.680]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.680 --> 59:31.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.520 --> 59:34.240]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.240 --> 59:40.240]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.240 --> 59:44.760]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go

[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:30.520]  all right we just joined us Ryan michaelus was flying with his father and
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:37.320]  his mother like Tahoe they had grabbed her behind in other areas they were
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.880]  told her now they were gonna grab her breast and they squeeze on to make sure
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.840]  they're real they grab your genitals folks I can't handle it and I've already
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.280]  told people I went through this once I said I'll go ahead and try they sure
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:56.720]  enough tried to grope my six-year-old daughter and I absolutely got angry and
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:05.240]  and and I can't deal with it okay I'm not a conditioned slave and it's time
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.840]  that this stops there's nothing to do with keeping us safe it's all about a
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.320]  power grab Bob Barr and other people agree with me Ron Paul agrees Jesse
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.200]  Ventura this is what it's about and I told you years ago they were gonna roll
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.920]  out on the streets now they're doing it I mean they want federal judge orders
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.640]  they need to be at high school proms see as long as you have a TSA person there
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.400]  then all the private security and police the federal wand is waived and they
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.840]  say now you're allowed to do what you were never allowed to do before and you
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:36.440]  go what's the law they say shut up we can do what we want well guess what
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:42.800]  Congress has just moved to slash the budget of the TSA the Texas grope band
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:48.120]  is moving towards getting back in the special session other states are moving
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.800]  to call the feds bluff we're on the March the Empire is on the run now going
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.480]  back to Ryan Mikolas whose mother was grope and by the time he got the
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.800]  camera on she was breaking down and crying and she did not fly they went
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:03.680]  ahead and went through the sexual assault to get to their destination the
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.560]  father and son did and again this is just the beginning with the airports
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.560]  finishing up you wanted to say something to chertoff who's the
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.800]  consultant for the main company making the money off this right I just wanted
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.040]  to point out that you know like everything you follow the money you
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.040]  find out what the real agenda is and when you follow the money for the body
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:29.080]  standards that goes back to Michael Chertoff who was ex homeland security head
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:36.320]  prior to miss Janet Napolitano our lovely ex governor you know it's it's
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.840]  interesting that as soon as he's out it's because he got his bid for the body
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:46.640]  standards be put in all the major airports it's not to protect us it's
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.120]  all an illusion it's just to keep us subjected and they've already made
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.520]  billions off these they're now announcing they want them at malls and on
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.880]  mobile trucks they purchased them they have these homeless curties announced

[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:37.440]  well we have the BBC here and they want me to talk about 9-11 and you know I
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:42.520]  don't think the BBC will cover this I mean I and I'll cover real issues with
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.880]  9-11 the BBC on two different channels 24 in world reported that building 7 the
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:52.640]  47-story skyscraper the biggest building in over 30 states in most cities it be
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:58.760]  the biggest building the CIA FBI based in it the homeland security previous of
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:03.320]  that federal security building the state security building all based inside of
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:09.200]  there and it falls into its own footprint and we have the police on video
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.680]  on CNN saying get back they're going to blow it up they're going to bring it
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.600]  down I've interviewed the cops that were there they said yeah there was a 10
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:22.560]  second countdown all of this happened and BBC reported 25 minutes before it
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.320]  fell that it had fallen into its own footprint a building that had some
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.960]  fires in it and I've interviewed Barry Jennings before he mysteriously died a
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.240]  few weeks later it was the deputy head of emergency management in New York
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.720]  saying that bombs went off in the building and then of course he had to
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:46.240]  die soon after deputy head of emergency management it's just incredible I mean
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:53.440]  does the BBC want to talk about Bush according to Newsweek and MSNBC signing
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:10:01.600]  a launch order to attack Afghanistan the day before 9-11 and that 18,000
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:07.720]  British troops and 44,000 US troops had masked in the stands around Afghanistan
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:13.120]  and carrier attack fleets were already in position ahead of the staged event or
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.760]  norad standing down something that never before happened and then the feds
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.800]  lying and saying we did no intercepts the year before except Payne Stewart and
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:27.400]  tried it was over 150 or perhaps we should talk about Stephen Butler the
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.680]  head of the Defense Language School who went public and said these hijackers
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.960]  were trained at US bases including our base or mainstream news reporting that
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:40.400]  Muhammad Atta and others were trained at other US bases or Mr. Springman former
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:45.600]  head of the US Embassy Visa Department his associates told him they were ordered
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.280]  to let Muhammad Atta and others back into the US in the year before 9-11 from
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:57.200]  their Al Qaeda summit because they were really US government agents I'm just
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.200]  supposed to ignore all that and oh but it gets better you see if I have a view
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.240]  if I have an idea if I don't believe what I'm told if I have critical thinking
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:11.400]  that doesn't absolutely agree with whatever I'm told if the government
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.880]  tells you the earth is flat and you don't agree with it you're a conspiracy
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:18.280]  theorist 500 years ago you were a heretic and were burned at the stake or put
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:24.800]  on house arrest like Galileo but today today conspiracy theory is the heresy
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.280]  but see they've used that so much it doesn't work anymore on every front even
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.320]  when the mainstream media in my opinion is telling the truth about something the
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:39.720]  dinosaur dying media people don't believe it in major polls the BBC ABC news
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:43.800]  they could tell the general public the sky is blue and it's true but they
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:50.040]  wouldn't believe it because they've been caught in so many reckless manipulations
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:58.880]  of the facts and so I proudly take the heretics letter scarlet letter onto
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:05.760]  myself that I am someone that questions what I'm told you see I remember the
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.760]  night of 9 11 I've been on air off and on all day and they were and they said
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:15.200]  oh we found one of the hijackers passports well in the wreckage of the
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.320]  collapsed towers now remember there's several feet of asbestos and concrete
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:23.960]  dust millions of papers conservatively blowing around body parts aren't bigger
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:34.320]  than an inch long and magically magically right there right there in
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.480]  front of everyone is one of the hijackers passports proving they did it in
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.840]  one of the other hijackers bags got stuck in the conveyor belt and didn't
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:48.480]  make it with all the admissions and a car with all the admissions of how they
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.960]  did it just right there open and shut now this plane at 500 plus miles an hour
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:59.240]  flies into the building and off their person the passport goes through the
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:06.000]  fireball through the building the plane is vaporized out but wait it gets
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.560]  better it's like Gollum's ring it calls to you and as I've said earlier it's
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.360]  made out of Thor's hammer stuff that's indestructible like the center of a sun
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:22.040]  it falls to the ground and is found that day and produced the next day of the
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:27.240]  world by the FBI they found it in all the millions of papers on the dust and
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:33.840]  the dead and the fires and the smoltering slag over a thousand degrees
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.320]  hotter than kerosene can burn but never mind the fact that months later there
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.760]  was molten slag down on the bottom all of that happened and then wait wait it's
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.920]  better I found another passport to almost completely undamaged and they found
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:55.360]  another one at flight 93 the whole plane disappears into the ground it just
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.480]  disappears engine miles away but the plane disappears into a hole in the
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:05.360]  ground but the passport didn't oh no they had that one too because it's made
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:12.280]  of a substance like a corks glue on particle that is that is impregnable
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.480]  they ought to build Abrams tanks out of this I mean they can have our special
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.680]  forces where what that passport was made out of and then just tank rounds with
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:24.280]  bounce off of them like Superman I mean reportedly if you eat one of these
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:28.760]  passports you become Superman I mean it's from another planet it's from
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:34.440]  Krypton okay I mean again and but if you don't believe that those passports came
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:38.800]  magically out to the ground were found and presented to the public and it's
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.800]  incredible they were found much less they survive you're a conspiracy theorist
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.720]  you're gonna buy whatever you're told now I want to go to we're gonna a bunch
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:50.120]  of subjects today we're gonna spend too long on on 9-11 but he had the courage
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:56.400]  over nine years ago council on farm relations fellow board examining top
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:01.120]  psychiatrists run major institutions around the country wrote the psychological
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.840]  warfare manual for the State Department London telegraph reports yeah he's been
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:10.440]  involved in manipulating the Communist into getting rid of Prime Minister of
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.960]  Italy he's overthrown governments he's he's done it all and he came on this
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:24.360]  broadcast he came on at the broadcast and he broke down the fact nine years ago
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.360]  that 9-11 was a staged false flag event and he went further he said bin Laden's
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:32.680]  dead on ice they're gonna roll him out in the future when it's politically
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.480]  expedient and then two years later in the election or year and a half later
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.480]  Madeline Albright former Secretary of State came out and said the same thing
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:43.920]  on Fox and see it in then Walter Cronkite big insider came out and said the
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.880]  same thing then three signs Kerry came out and said that's some credibility
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:51.440]  right there I guess their conspiracy theorists they said Bush don't roll him
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.880]  out we know you've got him so they held him back and then when the military
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.360]  industrial complex needed it later their war leader puppet Obama rolls it out
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.480]  at an expedient time and Dr. Steve Pachanik also is the co-author of many of
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:10.480]  the books with Tom Clancy he's the character Jack Ryan is based on in the
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:17.240]  Net Force and Ops Center and I'm not gonna go over the whole thing but I

[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:59.480]  world repeatedly including Syria and Panama and well we could just go on from
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:07.400]  there but Dr. Pachanik now joins us he also admittedly helped engineer the

[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.760]  gonna happen I forgot it was happening a BBC happens to be here today wanting to
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:32.880]  know about 9-11 what can you briefly tell them about 9-11 and the term

[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:43.600]  always happy to come back and talk to you and your audience 9-11 is the
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.000]  classical and the British know this better than anyone it's very naive for
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.400]  the BBC to or disingenuous for the BBC to ask what do we know about 9-11
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:59.040]  nobody's protected false flag and stand down operation better than the British
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:04.560]  over 200 years of ruling many countries it's a standard procedure this is not
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.720]  something and I don't mean to be blase I mean this is something I taught at the
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:14.320]  War Colleges the British teach this at the Stanhurst they have it at MI6, MI5
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:18.600]  every intelligence unit around the world knows that if you want to go to war
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:24.200]  whether it's Germany or with Stalin or it was under LBJ where we created an
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:30.720]  illusion that the Vietnamese shot us at us during the Gulf of Tonking then we
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.560]  went to war in Vietnam many many men died a whole country is paralyzed we pay
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.360]  for it 9-11 was an attempt by the Bush administration the Neocons,
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:49.400]  Wolfowitz, Elliott Abrams, Richard Perle, Dick Cheney, Donald Rundsfeld, Condoleezza,
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:53.920]  Rice, Steve Hadley, list goes on and on and on they wrote their premise very
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:19:00.480]  clearly in 1991 and they the paper on America and the future positions where
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:05.960]  we'd go and basically they created a situation where we had to go to war in a
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:10.840]  war that was very ambiguously termed that is we're going after terrorists what
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.040]  terrorists and it turned out we had two characters that they created one was
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.600]  Saddam Hussein who was not even involved in the entire thing and then
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.960]  somebody else called Osama bin Laden who had worked with us in 89-90 and a bunch
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:28.760]  of Al Qaeda operatives who were trained by us in Brooklyn and elsewhere under the
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:33.000]  Carter administration and Reagan and then on a Bush senior and the whole
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.440]  narrative just became out of control but unfortunately men and women die in
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:44.080]  America and America pays a very heavy price so we can't continue this type of
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:51.000]  nonsensical vitriolic narratives that are continuing till today where we're in
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.320]  the war in Afghanistan I have no idea whatsoever what the war in Afghanistan
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.600]  has to do there are no more Al Qaeda members we're shooting our so-called
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:04.840]  CIA said that we killed 2,000 Al Qaeda members if you if you price it out you
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:09.600]  got 20 you got about 50 million dollars for each of the 2,000 terrorists who
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:15.560]  supposedly were killed in Iraq we tried to establish a civil society using our
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:20.560]  military which failed so literally since World War two our intelligence and
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:25.760]  military industrial complex has brought us the complete defeat along with our
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:31.120]  ally England England and BBC is dead just as ingenuous as they are knows very
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.880]  well that they write right behind us in the intelligence system but they are
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:41.520]  deeply penetrating us they know that we provide them with intelligence even to
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:47.000]  the extent that so incestuous that bush juniors stupidly said that he's related
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.760]  to the Windsor family which of course the Windsor family has nothing to do
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:55.160]  with being British the German descent and wins is just the name of the place
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:00.760]  where the paintings are held so we have an an unholy alliance with England and
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:06.680]  at this point the issue is what is good for America and that's really what we
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:10.840]  have dad what do you make of England now Obama announcing letting them into the
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:15.280]  National Security Council something that Congress isn't even given with the
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:21.080]  National Intelligence Committee England has had a very very incestuous
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:25.000]  relationship with us now we go back let's go back to our history I want the
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.240]  American public particularly on your show to understand the only country we
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:36.200]  have gone to war with repeatedly repeatedly has been England 1776 the
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:40.320]  British called every one of our founding fathers terrorists so remember the
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:44.520]  American Revolution was not called the American evolution it was called the
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.440]  American Revolution we fought a very nasty battle with the British and the
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:55.160]  British were exceedingly nasty during the eight years that Washington had to
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.920]  retreat repeatedly if it weren't for the French under Napoleon we would not have
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:05.040]  succeeded in winning the Revolutionary War not stopping at that the British came
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:10.880]  back in 1812 and came back again to attack the colonies because Britain felt
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:15.880]  that in fact under their mandates and their attitude of colonialism America
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:21.120]  was still part of the British Empire having failed at that the British then
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:26.840]  brought us in to World War one because basically with all false flag deficit
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:31.880]  situations where they created you know they brought us into World War one the
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:37.680]  British have been exceedingly egregious in their relationship with the United
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:42.880]  States the Queen I mean this whole nonsense of the wedding and and the
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:47.240]  tour of the of the of the prince and the princess and the Queen I mean this is
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:51.080]  a narrative that's just not going to work in America we're not part of the
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:57.000]  royalty we do not bow down to God or man we do not believe in royalty and the
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.560]  crown is really a business and the BBC is part of that business so you have to
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.680]  think of royalty incorporated it's a multi-billion dollar business they have
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:11.320]  BP they have all kinds of issues that are related to Britain but Britain is not
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:16.280]  relevant to us anymore Europe is not relevant to us we can no longer do the
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:21.280]  bidding of the British intelligence which has failed repeatedly but rides on the
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:26.360]  back of American intelligence let me repeat it again during the stand down in
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:30.800]  the false flag Britain was right there behind us because Bush Jr. absolutely
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:35.600]  adores the British he's an Anglo file I'm not as you can see I think Britain has
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.520]  been a very deleterious country in the world affairs they've created a lot of
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.720]  problems the issues in the Middle East and the corrupt British ruling class is
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:50.360]  trying to give us their psychological sycophantic hatred of France when
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.720]  France helped create this country but the average American hates France just
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:24:00.960]  because we've been turned into this Anglophile servile group well that's
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:06.880]  that's not incorrect Alex it's useful I wouldn't say it is that strongly but I
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:10.880]  would say France helped us there's another part that I haven't talked about
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:15.120]  during the Civil War the British helped the South so they did not want to
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:20.440]  United States of America the French came in and helped us again in uniting
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:24.800]  England it was the British who supplied the Confederate States with the
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.480]  ammunition's and ran a lot of the embargoes so Britain now here's where it
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:34.280]  becomes very nefarious I guess I didn't tend this to go into Britain but when the
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.920]  CIA was created a central intelligence agent and America has to remember we
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.760]  did not have an organized intelligence organization Roseville was smart enough
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:49.360]  and Truman to create the OSS the Office of Strategic Services and we had to
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:55.560]  learn from a man called Kim Philby exactly how to build an intelligence
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:25:00.280]  service well as usual Britain had wittingly or unwittingly I'm not gonna
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:05.800]  say anything more they had five famous traders from Cambridge University four
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.720]  of them were blown out many of them were homosexual it's not an indictment of
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:15.880]  homosexuals and the fifth one was Kim Philby in 1952-3 two Israeli Mossad
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.320]  agents came in one was Teddy Copple the other one was Moshe Diane and at a
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.720]  meeting with James Jesus Angleton who was head of counterintelligence so the CIA
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.720]  they looked at Kim Philby and said what in God's name is this British operative
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:36.520]  doing here this is a communist he's not just KGB he's GRU now GRU in Russian
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:41.560]  Soviet intelligence is far more serious than KGB this is military intelligence
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.760]  for the Soviet Union well lo and behold the gentleman named James Jesus
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:49.160]  Angleton who was head of counterintelligence blew him out we were
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:54.440]  totally penetrated thanks to the British and the years on later there was
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.480]  always believed to be moles and lo and behold James Jesus Angleton was correct
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:03.800]  a reporter for CBS David Martin wrote about James Jesus Angleton he's not
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.920]  well-known in this country but if you look at the movie The Good Shepherd you'll
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:12.240]  get an idea by Robert De Niro you'll get a good idea what the history of the CIA
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.880]  was relative to Britain Britain is not a great ally Britain has really been a
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:22.920]  sycophant to the United States and it's time for the United States to decide what
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:27.920]  it wants for itself not what it wants for France not what it wants for England
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.000]  not what it wants for Israel now the United States is letting go of Israel
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.080]  Israel has to go on its own the Palestinian state will be declared by
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:41.600]  the UN the United States has to go away out of Iraq Afghanistan and we have to
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:46.200]  concentrate on whom we want to be the leader of this country not who England
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:51.240]  wants not who France wants not who Russia wants whom the American people want
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.800]  now we have a narrative of a man named Mr. Romney who claims that he is in a
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.600]  businessman and he has been you know the he's gonna be the next leader and can do
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:05.600]  all kinds of wonderful things for the Republican Party now what I'm getting at
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.400]  is both the Democrat and the Republican Party have been very much controlled by
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:15.480]  a system which does not allow us to have more choices than two people my
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:20.480]  daughter who a very bright young lady said to me one day dad you know I can go
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:27.160]  into the safeway I can go into a grocery store and get a hundred and two flavors
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.680]  of coffee but when I go into the democracy in the United States I get two
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:36.760]  flavors of politicians that's not democracy that's called a republic so
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.320]  basically I mean we're going from England to 9-11 to what we call the
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:47.440]  scripted pro forma process here in the United States which is a republic and
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.880]  this is where the American public under Alex Jones has to understand we can no
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:57.360]  longer accept this nonsense of two candidates one Obama with a history that
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:03.200]  no one understood came out of a CIA family and now you have Romney a Mormon
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:07.760]  I have nothing against Mormons they've been wonderful people who live for many
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:13.360]  years in Salt Lake City and had a questionable history as a businessman
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:18.840]  because being associates was not a great builder of companies it was a great
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:23.040]  finance of companies and goes out and tells these narrative stories that are
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:26.360]  absurd I want to stop right there I want to stop right there not a
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.720]  Virginia because I want to go back we're come back and get into all the other
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:33.400]  subjects that we've got here the Middle East change administration nature of
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:38.920]  politicians with a whole weiner's weiner affair Deb C we're gonna talk about
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:43.360]  those issues but I want to go back because the BBC's there and because the
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:49.240]  other shows about there they're with you yes they're here fine asked them
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:54.520]  whether they belong to my six or my five asked each one of them listen I asked
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:58.480]  that the the director guy said you know your government finance and run and he
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:02.600]  even denies that to me that's kind of like when the head of media matters the
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:07.360]  editor called me up and I said you're funded by George Soros and he said no
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:12.600]  or not and then I went and pulled up the SEC filings on online and read them to
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:16.880]  him and he laughed at me but let's let's stop there we're about to go to
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.440]  break when we come back last time you were on you broke down how you can see
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:25.240]  its intelligence operations because with the birthers with the deathers with the
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:29.880]  truthers they always have a made ready term like conspiracy theorists to try to
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:34.360]  paint people with a brush and then neutralize them so so let's talk about
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:38.000]  being conspiracy theorists when we come back and we'll get into a host of other
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  issues with Steve Pachennick Steve Pachennick.com
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:50.160]  Pachennick P-I-E-C-Z-E-N-I-K we'll be right back I'm Alex Jones and FullWars.com

[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:08.720]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.000]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.440]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:25.680]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.440]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:33.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.520]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.360]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:44.040]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:42.920]  parasitic system sitting on top of them great folks Paul Watson Steve Watson

[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:50.760]  team run in prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv Paul Watson guest host
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:55.040]  here they fully understand what's going on but but what I recommend the BBC
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:59.880]  they've probably already thought of it is by showing us attacking England you
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:05.160]  can bind the lie of 9-11 in false flag and your and your own stage 7-7 event
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:12.120]  you can bind that lie to people bashing England and then only 80% of the
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:16.840]  viewers won't believe you instead of 95 so we've actually fallen into your trap
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.240]  today what do you say to that Dr. Pechenick well I don't think anybody
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:25.280]  really cares about England I mean the British BBC understands that you can
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:30.040]  ask them you know they have exceedingly good journals for example like the
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:34.760]  Financial Times and economists if you ask them who they really are in Janeway
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:38.960]  you'll look at you know individual in the men who are sitting there working for
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.960]  my six or my five what they're there to do basically and sitting down and
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:47.240]  listening to you and me they didn't know what I'm going to say and they had no
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:52.160]  idea personally and professionally over five administrations I really let the
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:56.480]  British in anywhere near me or anywhere near my intelligence operatives
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:02.120]  because I knew they were basically trying to access our intelligence and I
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:06.520]  knew the history of British intelligence on the one hand they have you know they
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:09.880]  had their own national security requirements but they knew that the
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:14.680]  Empire was fading so basically they passed off the mantle to the United
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:19.000]  States they had no choice we had a very brilliant president in Roosevelt who
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.960]  understood Churchill's need to basically bring in the United States into World
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:27.840]  War two where we were really isolationist so the British sent over a very
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.800]  brilliant intelligence operated by the name of Stevenson which was called the
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.800]  double X and their intelligence units were in Cambridge University in England
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.680]  and they were very bright an encryption code and they created and they were able
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:45.200]  because of a Polish refugee to break down the codes of the German enigma they
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.280]  passed them on to us and then develop their own intelligence system with the
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:53.880]  spy that they infiltrated but the reality is England is not relevant they
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:58.400]  know that we know that exactly what you're about to say we got a lot to
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:02.240]  cover in the interest of time it's just interesting as a BBC it was the Dutch
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.920]  last week and others before that but expanding on this let's talk about the
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:13.200]  term conspiracy theorist anytime you ask a question anytime you don't believe a
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:18.080]  government or a corporate globalist media that's been caught lying over and
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:25.320]  over and over and over again anytime that happens we are called conspiracy
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:29.640]  theorists so I would say that Galileo instead of being called a heretic they
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:33.840]  should have called him a conspiracy theorist I mean I mean I think you're
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:38.560]  right Alex I mean it's semiotics it's a very fancy way of marginalizing people
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:44.440]  like yourself need the public because the truth was always suit generis who are
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:48.000]  onto itself coming from the government in other words whatever the government
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.160]  says it's supposedly the truth and therefore the media is their extension
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:56.920]  and that collusion that is the relationship between the media and the
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:02.400]  government is supposedly an embodiment of the truth now unfortunately in
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.600]  America because we're individualists and we've fought the British we've fought
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:11.400]  other Colonials many of us were refugees from that type of imperialism
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:15.560]  psychological imperialism where they tried to define the fact that they were
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:20.000]  supreme that the king and queen was supreme we didn't buy that nonsense the
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.760]  appeal to authority the appeal to authority that's correct I mean it's
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:28.560]  not only appeal it's submission to authority which you said was very
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:33.680]  correct Alex when you you bow down and kiss the ring now there's not one
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:36.960]  American that I know I certainly were never bowed down nor would I kiss the
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.040]  ring nor would I accept the royalty the point is you've got to look at it as a
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.920]  very cynical enterprise where the BBC is part of it is called Royal England
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:51.240]  Incorporated it's like any other business the Queen is right sucked around to go
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:56.160]  to Ireland they forget that they in fact created one of the first genocides in
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:03.120]  Ireland in the 1600s where millions of Irish farmers men and women innocently
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.080]  were killed because the British would not supply them with food and what
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.840]  happened in Parliament in England they said let nature take its course that's
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:15.680]  in the history books there's no conspiracy here of the British don't tell
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:19.880]  you that was that Malthusian eugenics they saw the Irish as animals the
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:24.240]  British invented concentration camps in South Africa in the war for the Dutch
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28.920]  well let's get into that let's let's get into that in the war war Churchill who
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.840]  was this grandiose narcissistic individual had nothing else wanted to get
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:39.360]  into the war was the journalist and so in 1890s when the boars with the
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.640]  Apheconas which were really Dutch reformist you've been in South Africa for
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:49.760]  300 years they first went down to the Cape Town and they discovered gold and
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:57.960]  and diamonds there the British came in to get over under Cecil Rhodes then the
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:01.920]  boars backed up into the Taozulu land where the British came in and tried to
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:05.720]  beat them again and made themselves a hero they called it the Boar War when in
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:10.800]  fact it was the English War now if that's conspiracy of course the British
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.120]  it's nonsense because the British created that war the concept of
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.920]  concentration camp your audience and understand was created by the British
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:26.960]  they rounded up 24,000 innocent women women and children 24,000 put them in
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:31.080]  camps even Hitler said I didn't create the concentration I was the British in
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:37.280]  order to force the Apheconas the South African fighters these were farmers to
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:41.560]  come back and take care of their kids but instead they were slaughtered so the
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.880]  British created the term Boar War they said we were fighting for democracy and
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.120]  we were fighting for liberty when in fact they were dividing for gold the
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:55.440]  Anglo-American corporation which decides diamond prices every day they were
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:00.520]  fighting for imperialism and basically they've really been very ineffectual and
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.480]  very vitriolic and dangerous in the history so what they want to hear now
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:09.160]  from a man like you Alex Jones is really it's it's kind of a backhanded
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:14.680]  compliment why would the BBC spend their time to listen to Alex Jones when in
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:19.280]  fact they have all of the nonsense they can hear and they track and they do what
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:23.560]  we call content analysis in the New York Times they do the Wall Street Journal
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.440]  content analysis that's what they do I mean they sit there in the little cubicles
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:32.320]  and read that but unfortunately this Alex Jones can't be contained and he
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:37.960]  represents a part of America that Britain can call radical conspiratorial
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:43.080]  fundamentalist all the little tags that do not apply that's why this is a
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.360]  backhanded compliment to you and the fact that the British are willing to take
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:51.640]  the time is an indictment of the fact that the British are really concerned
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:56.200]  and don't understand how to handle the situation where Americans are saying
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:01.680]  listen since 1776 get out of our way don't bother us you're a failed out
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:05.560]  empire and you're a failed state now that doesn't mean the English are nice
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:09.720]  people it's just the system is failed they're part of the bailout problem
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:13.520]  they're economically a failure they really haven't produced anything their
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:17.840]  growth rate is very low they have nothing else to do now at this point
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:23.800]  America has to realign itself reassert itself as a power and begin to continue
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:28.400]  on and manufacturing domestically this is what's happening and by the way let me
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:31.840]  I want to shift gears in these politicians of their narcissism but very
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.960]  well said from your great historical research I love history myself because
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:40.400]  those that don't know history are them to repeat it but you know why do I call
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.480]  the Queen of England a monster you know the word you explained it to them I
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:48.680]  know why you called it but I want you to tell the American I'm gonna explain it
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:53.960]  because we need to pull down these false idols you have this narcissistic
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:42:01.800]  clown in in in ancient headdress meant to impress the commoners that's what you
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:05.640]  know all primitive civilizations the chief wears all the big feathers and
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:09.400]  outfit you know to impress everybody that that's why they're in control she's
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:14.000]  running around you know in this gallon of diamonds from dead Africaners and
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.920]  others and she's up there doing things a few years ago like Diego Garcia openly
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:26.120]  forcing what was it 5,000 Islanders off their land shoving it off to turn into a
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:29.760]  military base when they didn't even need to force the people off to build a
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.920]  military base the effect they were happy to have it there and there was a bit
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:36.480]  based there already I mean that's what I'm talking about is that I'm sick of
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.920]  watching her mercenaries run around and take over the planet and watching her
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:45.360]  suspend parliament in Canada three times in the last three years and then and then
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.840]  having to hear about how she's ceremonial and has no power when you said it
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:52.320]  she's the biggest donor of British petroleum I'm tired of them meddling in
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:56.400]  my politics I'm tired of it I'm tired of being a slave I don't want to be a slave
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.640]  and so I'm pulling down their idols because I'm an American as my ancestors
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:05.800]  did burning effigies of King George the Third all over the 13 colonies it's
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:12.000]  important to rebuke all of this brainwashing I agree with you I you
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.200]  have full agreement my relationship with the English is that fact that I find
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:21.080]  them sick offense I find it it's a failed state I find that their false idols
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:24.880]  are what they want to pay for it's really up to the British public who can
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.400]  barely afford anything else most of them I'm I understand they're on liquid a
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:33.440]  courage they're drunk and they're really not producing anything I mean the
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:37.200]  Rolls-Royce which was the emblem and icon of a great car it's really not even
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:41.200]  at that car anymore we don't even look at that issue we buy our own cars we
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:46.400]  create our own industries Britain had is finished it's been finished since World
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:50.800]  War two and the end of World War one but the British intelligence knows this by
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:56.560]  1900 Britain had failed it had a huge military it had one of the largest
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:00.760]  navies in the world and that's why Lord Milner wrote a few years after that and
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:05.440]  those are been released now they had to start a war with Germany and then after
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:11.920]  that they said we're gonna put horrible recriminations with the Versailles on
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:16.760]  Germany and then hopefully that'll foam in a dictator which they then funded and
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.680]  then once the dictator went wild they use that to wreck Europe and to come in as
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:25.800]  the saviors again that is premeditated evil well correct I mean let's go a
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:30.800]  little bit further they created what we call it the Biden conquer strategy in
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.600]  the Middle East they put the Hashemite kings who were really the descendants of
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:41.480]  a Mohamad and then instead of putting them in the mecca and Medina and Saudi
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:45.640]  Arabia the Arabian Peninsula after the Ottoman Empire they put a four-year-old
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:50.360]  Hashemite ruler in Iraq which did not exist there a woman by the name of
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:56.240]  Bertru Bell head of MI6 under whom the famous homosexual leader Lawrence of
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:01.160]  Arabia was brought in and was defied by the British and their intelligence
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:06.280]  system created this country called Iraq between Kurds Sunni and Shi'i which
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:11.800]  never existed in order to unify it for revenue basis for their oil and they
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:16.240]  then took the next Hashemite leader and put him into Jordan or trans-Jordan which
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:21.840]  never existed and they said this is a new leader whereas in fact the real
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:27.040]  people of that area were the Berbers were the Muslims of the Arabs they
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:30.960]  divided in conquer so that they could never be a central power that they
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:34.880]  could not control the same thing they did United Arab Emirates they did it in
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:40.200]  Saudi Arabia Aramco was really a British outfit in Saudi Arabia they know
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:44.520]  they've lost Saudi Arabia the issue now is between the Sunnis and the Shiites and
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:48.280]  guess what happened subsequently after they messed up the Middle East and
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.760]  created also the state of Israel in order to protect the southern flag they
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:56.960]  used Iraq to protect the northern flag and they used Saudi Arabia to protect
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:02.400]  their southern flank in terms of the post-world world one the Ottoman Empire
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.880]  they then had lost World War two because they were so stretched out that they
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:16.040]  reached out to a man called Stevenson and Churchill and really big for FBR to
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:20.960]  give them land lease this was not a democratic issue this was an issue where
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:25.640]  they were vulnerable their whole military had been splayed out over the
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:30.760]  Middle East and in Singapore in Singapore they had 35,000 soldiers at
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:35.800]  the tip of Singapore and the Japanese came on bicycle through Malaysia into
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:40.760]  Singapore and arrested all of them and one of the famous writers of that or was
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:45.120]  a prisoner was a man by the name of James Clavel King Rast so the British
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:50.040]  have been a disaster in strategy a disaster in tactics Montgomery was one
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.920]  of the worst generals I've ever had but they did fight him and we had Pat who
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:58.960]  said you know F to Montgomery and he just swung around the third army and
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:03.120]  brought it right into Germany so Britain has been nothing more than an anchor on
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:08.680]  the weight of America let it go I think Britain knows it's not relevant Britain
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:14.120]  understand it just an arcane vitriolic institution that has no relevancy to it
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:18.360]  and let America go again otherwise you know we have nothing to do with Britain
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.280]  it offers us nothing other than a vitriolic what's running the whole
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.400]  Libya situation is it Italy France or England or a constellation of those
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:33.080]  three and we have the same Al Qaeda people again the core of the rebels and
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:37.040]  Obama saying you know the attack helicopters have to go in from the
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:42.600]  British now what's going on with that Libya situation well it is where Obama
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:47.520]  again this this ineffectual leader basically said look ah ah Gaddafi has
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:50.960]  to leave and I've been in a lot of regime change and one of the things that I
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:54.760]  always on it was a president who kept his mouth quiet and knew what national
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:48:00.000]  security was so the work we did or I did with others it was to take the regime
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.520]  down and then the president could announce we had a transition but we didn't
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.280]  make a great point of it let me give you an example I was not involved in the
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:11.640]  major transition of apartheid which was really quite an impressive transition it
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:17.400]  was done quietly under George H. Bush senior quietly over eight years I have
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:23.000]  yet to this day heard Bush senior ever take credit for the change in apartheid
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.920]  and bringing Mandela and the clerk out now in all fairness to the British this
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:30.760]  has got to be fear if we're going to attack them I also want to give them
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.800]  credit it was British intelligence and sociologists who went into South
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:41.480]  Africa and for two to three years spent time with the Africa owners and the
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:46.040]  British divisions of South Africa is about three million people and really
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:49.960]  taught them down and worked them through so that this would be a peaceful
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:54.400]  transition because I thought there would be a bloodbath so give off the Caesar
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:58.720]  that which is Caesar's and let's render on to them which they did well and they
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:02.840]  did an excellent job in that transition all right let's completely shift gears
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:08.840]  now into Weiner dealing with this narcissism lying and saying it wasn't
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:12.760]  the photo of him now saying it probably is and he's in a lot of trouble we have
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:17.000]  Schwarzenegger running around now with all these other loved children we've got
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.960]  Dominic Strauss-Kahn we've got other reports out of France with other
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:26.560]  leaders reportedly running around with quote little boys in Morocco what who
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.840]  are these people well you know actually you brought this up you were
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:34.360]  prescient I'm not gonna flatter you but we were prescient and you particularly
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:37.560]  were very prescient a couple of weeks ago when I was on the radio show and we
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:41.840]  talked about you asked me the question what is the profile of a politician
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.560]  Republican Democrat British non-British doesn't matter they all follow pretty
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:49.880]  much the same thing I've treated them I've seen them I've worked with them
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.200]  number one they're very narcissistic what does that mean in a fancy work they
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:59.480]  love themselves you can't give them enough gratitude and adulation because
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:03.480]  every day they have to feel they're like movie stars between Hollywood and
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:07.560]  Congress there's really no difference either one produces anything and neither
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.720]  one has a product secondly they need to self-aggrandize themselves to the point
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:17.440]  that they forgot they do not represent anything other than themselves this is
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:22.040]  the real danger of our politicians whether they Republican or Democrats
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:26.880]  thirdly they have to look in accurate so no one can really appeal to their
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:31.000]  narcissism and their sense of self-worth other than themselves and in order to
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.320]  gratify it these inadequate men for the most part many of them are very shy
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:40.680]  they're very inadequate both physically emotionally and sexually and they go out
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:45.360]  and they go on the internet they twitter to show off what they think they may or
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:50.280]  may not have which is really not as well stay right there doc board certified

[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:50.160]  planet dot TV with the we got a week behind posting some of these new
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:54.240]  special films we've made because we don't even have a staff that's big enough
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:59.720]  to get it all done we see if that's up on prisonplanet.tv yet the
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:09.600]  Tarplee eugenics special but it's hard to type and talk here bottom line there's
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:13.240]  a lot of new stuff at prisonplanet.tv and it's 15 cents a day and your
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:17.560]  membership makes so much of what we do here possible going back to Dr. Steve
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:23.800]  Pachennick doc continuing with the narcissism we've got John Edwards being
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:27.760]  charged with conspiracy I thought conspiracy didn't exist lying over a
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:30.960]  million dollars reportedly for his mistress and we've got the Swartz
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:36.240]  and Egger we've got the Wiener stuff I mean what is wrong with these guys you
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:39.960]  were getting into their mindset how they operate as you said they think the
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:45.520]  whole world is them it's correct I mean the issue here is that remember the
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:49.560]  readers that work very closely with Clinton I mean continues to he brings
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:54.320]  up the issue that his wife has worked for Bill Clinton now it's not for 15
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:58.280]  years and I'm sure his wife is a lovely lady she's chief of staff for Hillary
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:03.360]  Clinton but here you get the recapitulation of a man again a narcissist
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:08.240]  like Bill Clinton who has to get fladed in the White House he's so bold and
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:12.800]  totally it just doesn't care about the American public the inappropriateness as
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:17.240]  a behavior and here you have the recapitulation and the man who worked
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:21.960]  with him or admired him or his wife or to this so it's a recapitulation the key
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:26.680]  here for the audience to understand is I don't care what they do privately but
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:30.240]  I'm not going to pay for it as an American citizen right now I'm paying and
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:34.920]  I've calculated for 435 members of Congress all of whom for the most part are
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:39.680]  useless 200 senators who have really nothing to do except to create a think
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:44.920]  there and really can go home we're paying about close to two billion dollars a
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:49.080]  year for their salary and their staffs and the staff is there do nothing more
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:54.240]  that's allow them to self-abandonize go out get their name in the paper and get
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:57.800]  reelected and we don't need this anymore in America that's our own Royal
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:03.040]  Parliament so in a way we recapitulating the narcissist and an idiocy what I
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:07.800]  found in England and that has created the downfall of civilization the Chinese
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:12.440]  are watching us and seeing how we're basically wasting money wasting an
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:16.680]  incredible let me say again over two billion just for their staffs and their
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:20.520]  own salaries for which they've done very little I wouldn't mind getting that
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:26.720]  kind of salary 177,000 plus 1.5 million per staff for doing really nothing and
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:31.040]  getting myself back at work to do nothing at the end of the day now what
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:34.000]  does that mean to the American public that means the American public and
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.800]  particularly in your audience they've got to understand we talk stay there got a break
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:47.680]  back in 60 seconds stay with us you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:55.480]  today a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:59.880]  the most important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:03.760]  everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:07.240]  children and even how you take care of your health and your own family now this
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:11.320]  man has made some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's
[01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:15.640]  usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM Panny Mae Freddie Mac
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:19.640]  and America's biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact Barron's

[01:59:52.160 --> 02:00:06.400]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:13.720]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:21.920]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:25.920]  well daughter Steve Pachanik's really been gracious in the last month or so to
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:28.880]  give us so much time here on air look forward to having back and back up
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:34.480]  again soon we're almost out of time but but doc I love my wife and I feel like
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:40.360]  I have a responsibility to my children and I am a man though and you know women
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:44.840]  are very attractive but but still I have a sense that you know there's a larger
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:48.200]  mission and I need to be faithful to my family and I'm not saying any of us are
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:52.120]  perfect but then you look at these politicians who have these incredible
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:57.560]  responsibilities the Bill Clinton's the Swartz Senagers the the Wieners and
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:02.640]  it they're just they're always so reckless and when you describe narcissism
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:08.360]  earlier as thinking of yourself as the whole world people think well that's
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:13.640]  greed that's getting ahead we know narcissism is spreading and then people
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:16.600]  are narcissistic who are older and older you're the real expert on that but just
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:20.560]  when you described as thinking you're the whole world I remember as a small a
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:26.000]  child realizing that dressing up like Batman didn't make me Batman and I saw
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.080]  the other kids still thinking they were Batman I realized that that I'm part of
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:35.040]  something bigger in society and then I'm gonna die but that I do want future
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:39.880]  generations to have it good and it's not that I'm even some great guy I'm driven
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:45.040]  by not wanting to be a slave not wanting to be beaten by scum by wanting to win
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.840]  and seeing humanity win and I am very aggressive I'm not even saying I'm a
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:53.480]  perfect person but what would you call an Alex Jones or somebody like a Steve
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:57.960]  Pachennick who like yourself especially who wants to be behind the scenes versus
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:03.600]  people sending photos of their their private parts to women and I mean it
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:09.200]  just sounds like fifth-grade behavior well you're absolutely right I think you
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:13.280]  and I fit into a category that they would like to call whatever they want but
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:18.320]  basically you would say we're rogues or mavericks we don't allow anybody to
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:25.520]  subsume us or make us slaves to their ideas their icons or to a process and
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:30.560]  that's not what the process requires the process wants those people who are not
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:33.760]  accountable so you and I are accountable for what we do in our
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:37.240]  private lives you're accountable for what you say I'm accountable for what I say
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:41.600]  I'm accountable for my businesses you're accountable for your businesses in this
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:47.000]  process of the loyalty in the process of the congressional and the political
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:52.480]  system there is no accountability that's why you get very weak people who have no
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:56.400]  accountability and they just promote themselves because you can't say hey
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:00.120]  listen you know you bankrupted this company and now you're gonna bankrupt
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:04.040]  this country you haven't had accountability on our bank was not one
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:08.120]  banker has yet been indicted for the most criminal acts in the world so you
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:13.320]  have a process with no accountability full all responsibility but nobody's
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.840]  willing to take responsibility yet you have a system where there are people who
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:21.800]  are accountable and you don't see the narcissism coming up our brave men and
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:26.000]  women who go into the field and die whether they're an intelligent system
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.840]  the military system or a civilian you don't hear about them you're quiet
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:36.040]  heroes the quiet heroes the people the everyday American does not need to say
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:42.880]  me me me the politicians who have no accountability and have to continuously
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:49.160]  fed with total irresponsible process not product but process has nothing to do
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:53.040]  but talk about themselves because that's all they've ever thought of that so
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:56.960]  instead of resigning having a sense of shame which they have no sense of shame
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.440]  they have no real what we call super ego that they are responsible for their
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:05.200]  behavior they continue to go on Clinton was a perfect example oh yes I didn't do
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:09.760]  anything but I correct the becoming no he did the man who probably did most was
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:14.560]  gore or whatever but you don't see the responsible leaders and can you imagine
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:19.800]  an Eisenhower supreme I allied commander doing any of these behaviors yes
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:25.120]  there's no and what Truman said was very clear these men and women they
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:30.200]  confuse the office they're in with their own personality the office of the
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:36.600]  presidency is what allows Obama to do all the narcissistic foolish behavior
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:40.800]  that he's doing this time and bringing us to unemployment a huge debt ceiling
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.920]  and an economy that's crashing but you know hold on doctor but I want to bring

[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:07.800]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:12.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.040]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:19.920]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:23.960]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:28.360]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:32.640]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:36.360]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:40.560]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:45.800]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're back live dr. Steve Petrinick about to
[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:50.920]  leave us but he was getting into Obama's narcissism Bob Chapman was in US
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:54.960]  intelligence worked against the Russians in Germany before he went on to be the
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:09:01.520]  biggest private silver and gold broker and helped finance the Gary Allen
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:06.480]  report co-authored that helped put out an undare call a conspiracy also of
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:10.680]  course fighting the whole new world order crowd for a very long time and Bob
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:14.240]  Chapman joins us and I have no idea what Bob's gonna ask him probably with us for
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:18.080]  the rest of the hour getting into the huge economic developments like Moody
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:22.800]  saying yes the US may lose its triple a rating well it was staring in pores two
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:27.560]  months ago said that this is big news a lot of financial news we're gonna come
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:31.840]  with Bob Chapman but Bob I have no idea what you're gonna ask Steve Petrinick
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:36.000]  but I like that wild card do you have any questions or comments for Dr. Steve
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:44.040]  Petrinick first of all Steve nice to meet you nice and the question I have is do
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:48.080]  you see any possibility considering the Manhattan District Attorney has bought
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:54.000]  charges against Goldman Sachs that perhaps there will be more charges
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  brought against other firms for the criminality that they got involved in
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:03.900]  yes it's the issue I think it's an excellent question I don't know the
[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:07.560]  gentleman but I knew his father Cyrus fans junior and I have a very great
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:12.480]  respect for the entire family the issue is going to come down to an indictment
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:16.280]  back now here's the key word there will be an arrangement that's made with
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:20.120]  Goldman Sachs but what I'm requesting on behalf of the American public and I
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:24.640]  think it's very important that be an indictment of Goldman Sachs now why is
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:31.720]  that important because criminal charges have to be a place on Blankfine the
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:36.200]  deputy owner of the the because I was a former managing director of investment
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:40.400]  banking from that went under and I took them under and I know exactly how it has
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:44.600]  to go in terms of the investment banking firm there will be people who will be
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:49.160]  brought in probably the group that's a correlation trading desk on a Jonathan
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:54.640]  Eagle EGOL the French guy was Fabrice Touré that was brought up David Gerst
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:58.880]  will be brought up Jordan Kaufman will be brought up Darren Thomas will be
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:03.520]  brought up Jeff Williams and you power and the Goldman employees from other
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:06.920]  departments that were involved in advocates as you know the three by the
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:10.800]  way did you have intel on this because you've said the last few interviews they
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:15.520]  need to be indicted they will be indicted did you have some scuttlebutt no
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:20.280]  no but let me tell you what happened I'm just listening I'm a business man I
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:24.560]  didn't have any insight information on any of this but it's not hard like you
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:30.600]  do Alex to go in and to notice a year before and and Chapman can tell you this
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:36.320]  a year before they were indicted and investigated the Goldman Sachs was
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:41.640]  selling these artificial securitized CDOs securitized debt applications which
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:46.040]  really meant nothing it was artificially created then telling and they
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:50.600]  were standing where they're coming in and buying against their own products and
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:55.040]  shorting it so you could see it on the market I saw it on the market I called
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:58.920]  up several people I said listen this is an indictment this criminal activities
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:03.680]  going on I was dismissed and I said repeatedly if you do not indict these
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:09.360]  people at Goldman Sachs their sterns you talk about JP Morgan people come up
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:14.000]  Morgan Stanley none of them are clean by the way let's go back to the rating
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.800]  agency moody here's an issue where we got to go to Warren Buffett who should be
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:23.400]  investigated repeatedly and has been brought up at this false narrative
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:28.960]  hero of America this poor old man whom everybody goes to but in fact owned Moody's
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:33.720]  took all of the junk product this Chapman can tell you which was rated at
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:38.680]  double E that's very low tranche that means it's a chunk of the junk Moody's
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:43.960]  then rated as triple A and sold that artificial non-existing product of
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:50.760]  mortgage STO's and then FDS's and sold it all over the world where everybody
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:54.360]  kind of fees millions and hundred millions that I was upbeat now if you
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:59.880]  don't tell me that that Warren Buffett should be indicted that blank find should
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:03.880]  be invited that Jack find should be indicted and instead we have this
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:08.800]  nonsensible movie and book story about it too big to fail where they made a
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:14.880]  hero out of Paulson out of Geithner and out of Bernati all of them were
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:18.760]  incompetent and green-skinned should be indicted because he took this whole
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:23.080]  economy right over the abyss and comes back and tells the American public all
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:27.520]  this was a little aberration you know it goes back to the issue of narcissism it
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:32.120]  goes back to the issue of accountability the American public must insist on
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:36.040]  criminal indictments mr. Chapman yes and for those that don't know the indictments
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:40.080]  goes all the way to blank find he has to go to prison it goes to Warren Buffett
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:46.240]  it goes to Moody's it goes to FCP there's no there are no innocent people in
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:51.160]  this business then you go to the clinic for those that don't know back on May 25th
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:57.000]  Cyrus Vance Jr. did announce the indictment of major organized you know
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:03.160]  groups and he's also moving towards other indictments talking about some of
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:07.280]  these different banks but Bob Chapman briefly give us the latest on these
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:14.760]  moves towards indictment only what I've read in the press and they're they're in
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:21.040]  the process of doing so and they did indictment to Edwards today if you hadn't
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:28.120]  heard no they didn't but I you know I've been writing about this ever since
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:32.080]  and before it happened and this whole episode of the mortgages and the
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:39.520]  securitization and and especially I just can't believe that the rating agencies
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:44.480]  get away with what they get away with and the civil suits against them would
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:49.120]  dismiss I which I couldn't believe you're right so the question why they
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:52.200]  were dismissed and why they should have been criminally indicted mr. Chapman
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:57.280]  by the way speaking of a blank find Goldman Sachs they've now sent him
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:06.840]  subpoenas today that's right it's a beginning but not enough
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:11.640]  Cyrus Vance Jr. has to understand there has to be an indictment criminal
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:16.960]  indictment not just of the Daniel Sparks was the department head of Goldman
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:21.600]  Sachs mortgage department it has to go all the way up to the CEO there is no
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:26.120]  and I can categorically tell you there is no investment banking firm
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:31.080]  particularly Goldman Sachs which prides itself on being a key organization
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:35.320]  translated means they're under total tight control under blank find who was a
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:40.840]  trader t-r-a-b-e-r and also could be a trade of the American public basically
[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:44.600]  they have to be criminal indictment it's not enough to get a civil suit out of
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:48.720]  this and if they're going to pay a penalty again and not admit guilt we
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:52.320]  have not accomplished the job that we should have on behalf of the American
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:57.920]  public and that's where Mr. Levin said at 11 of the set up the Senate has to
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:01.680]  come in and that's where holder inside now okay what's interesting in all of
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:08.520]  this Bob and and and Alex is that it's the attorney general of Manhattan that's
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:11.880]  bringing suit it's not the federal government and the question is why did
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:16.200]  not why is the federal government not involved yes you can bring any of you
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:19.520]  will that attorney general better not fly anytime soon we better not be
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:23.240]  visiting you know any women he should know or he'll end up like the governor
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:29.760]  in New York expanding on this if you just joined us ladies and gentlemen two
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:34.200]  weeks ago the Rolling Stone which is a little mouthpiece of certain area the
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:38.400]  establishment came out and said the Senate committee has found criminal
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:43.000]  activity by Goldman Sachs AP Morgan where are the indictments and we see
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.640]  things moving in that direction and we see some of the underlings getting in
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:50.280]  trouble but but that was my next point we need to see the big guys get in
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:54.640]  trouble because now since the bailouts that they haven't stopped all this fraud
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.800]  they've actually taken the bailout money and put it back into the kitty well
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:04.240]  listen great talking to you dr. Steve Pachennick Steve Pachennick com thank
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:08.920]  you very much and thank your people for listening thank you and we'll talk to
[02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:13.160]  you again hopefully very soon take care going back to Bob Chapman for the
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:17.080]  balance of the hour Bob so much is happening I want to tackle first what
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:20.360]  do you make of Moody's coming out yesterday for those that don't know now
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:25.120]  the second of the big three rating agencies behind Sharon and Pours and
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:31.400]  saying that it looks like the US could lose its credit rating is that saber
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:36.960]  rattling by the establishment to get them to raise the debt ceiling or is
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:45.200]  something else happening two things the debt ceiling and also the purification
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:52.920]  of the next quantitative easing whatever they may call it and they want
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:58.160]  both of them and they want them desperately because without them they're
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:05.200]  going to have serious problems if the legislation is not passed to extend the
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:10.920]  debt limit to say sixteen point three trillion which is short-term debt what's
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:15.040]  going to happen is that the federal government will have to continue to take
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:22.160]  money from the pension plan which is supposed to be going into those plans
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:28.720]  instead it's being diverted into running the government and if we get to
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:34.400]  August the second or before and they say okay we win a deal here we're going to
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:38.960]  do this that and the other thing and it's all fixed up but how are they going
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:44.520]  to pay back the pension plan the money that means that they're going to have
[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:50.120]  to issue even more bonds on the other hand if it's rejected I mean you're
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:56.560]  going to have a circus number one there will be a downgrading and
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:03.520]  that's what Moody's and Pitch and S&P are trying to tell people but it is being
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:10.600]  used to scare taxes at tactics as well and most of what the government does
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:15.200]  and has done is usually hollow all right let me stop you we're going to break you
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:19.800]  called it again over and over again for the last six months you said there will
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:24.760]  be QE three they're going to say they're not doing it but they will and you've
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:29.960]  said that for the last month every week every Friday I said it last week so now
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:34.480]  on record they're coming out and saying well we're going to do QE three but we're
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:39.400]  not going to call it that so let's talk about what that means and how you were
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:43.880]  able to predict that they would not just have QE three or for layman turning up
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:48.800]  the printing presses at light speed but how you knew they'd lie about it because
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:52.240]  I didn't lie on the last two rounds so how'd you know that Bob we'll break that
[02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:55.440]  down the other side what's coming up for gold and silver other major commodities
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:20:00.720]  we'll look at a bunch of other news as well stay with us we'll be right back

[02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:08.680]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network what we
[02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:14.560]  need is at least 10 state attorney generals or if we have to local district
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:19.000]  attorneys to start criminal investigations on JP Morgan Goldman Sachs and
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:23.440]  others I mean they've committed crimes publicly I mean even the establishment
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:29.080]  Rolling Stone says indict them I mean they destroyed our civilization if they
[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:33.680]  can basically get the first down and make another goal on us I mean they've
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:38.360]  sold the fraud too big to fail we're attached to this time bomb we've got
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:43.480]  to cut this time bomb off of us and push it over the edge of a cliff and that
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:47.920]  means bringing these people to justice because if it's allowed to explode it's
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:51.840]  the end of society there's no way to pay all this off we don't owe it it's a
[02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:57.120]  fraud same thing for Iceland same thing for Ireland the same thing for Portugal
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:01.960]  Greece it's a fraud going back to Bob Chapman Bob you called it you said
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:06.000]  they've got to do QE3 they're gonna do QE3 but they're not gonna say they're
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.600]  doing QE3 then they came out and said we're not doing QE3 and then now they're
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:16.640]  basically still monetizing the debt moving forward and they have to they
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:22.400]  can't afford any gap you saw the first quarter GDP down it was up 1.8 percent
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:29.920]  remind you about 1.8 trillion dollars was pumped into the economy and that's
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:34.100]  all I got I thought they'd even do better than that that's with code numbers we
[02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:37.920]  know they're cooking the GDP like I'm probably even worse than that then and
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:44.960]  but even the second quarter I think if they illegally you bogusly commitment
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:51.080]  one and a half to two percent the second to the third and fourth quarters are
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:55.640]  going to be dreadful there'll be zero to minus unless they get this money
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:01.080]  quickly into the economy now I'm not talking about only the purchase of
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:05.720]  Treasury securities with money out made up of thin air I'm talking about them
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:10.400]  getting into the economy and trying to make things happen and they've got to do
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:15.840]  that and I think that's what they'll try to do this time whether they want to do
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:22.120]  it or not and so that will be the next step and we're going through the fallout
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:28.120]  of the stage of QE1 and stimulus one right now with approximately 10%
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:32.600]  inflation it'll be 14 by the end of the year next year we'll get the fallout
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:39.400]  inflation wise from QE2 stimulus 2 and that should take us up to 25%
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:45.840]  inflation maybe 30 and then if we have the QE3 from anywhere between 1.7 and
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:50.640]  2.5 trillion in this coming year and a half that's coming up then we got a
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:55.240]  shot at 50% inflation which is hyperinflation and that's where this
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:59.280]  thing's headed and that's why some of the members of the Fed is saying gee we
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:04.080]  can't do this that's rats leaving the sinking ship to have the Dallas Fed
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:10.720]  Kansas City Fed and others open and Greenspan earlier this year at the
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:15.520]  Jekyll Island anniversary meeting said big banks have engaged in crime he's
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:20.000]  basically tattling on their own system to act like he's not a kingpin in it but
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.440]  to have more and more of their own board members denouncing what's happened
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:28.680]  shows they understand that they have bitten off more than they could chew as
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:32.880]  Brzezinski said last year people aren't looking at puppet presidents anymore
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:38.160]  they know who's running the show they know who to blame and that's why it's
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:43.280]  so important that we keep up this crusade that you're doing and others like
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:48.280]  you on radio and as well as through the internet we're beating them to death as
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:52.920]  you said a few weeks ago we're breathing down their collar and they don't know
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:58.000]  what to do and that is the truth we're beating them and we got to keep it up
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.600]  until we stop them we're starting to beat the TSA they just got 270 million
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:05.680]  they're funding Congress moving with laws to ban the growth downs and machines
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:11.280]  Texas is trying to reintroduce the bill to ban it other states are moving polls
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.560]  are showing over 90% are against it I mean on every front when we fight we
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:21.840]  win and that's absolutely right and all we have to do is very simply tell the
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:27.400]  truth and Steve was just on I asked him the right question he was very much
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:33.840]  imbued in that whole thing he understood and came up with the lightning fast
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:37.600]  answer this is what we ought to do to them I've been saying that for a long
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:42.480]  time but he isn't he doesn't have my venue and he's absolutely right we got
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:46.560]  to put him away we got to take their wealth away from them and give it to the
[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:51.960]  government to reduce our debt that's what we got to do and then we don't have
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:56.920]  to raise taxes we don't have to cut all of the safety net and I'm against the
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:00.960]  main safety net because it makes us dependent but it's a red herring to
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:07.640]  say cut all of this and raise taxes when that wouldn't fix anything Bob and you
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:10.880]  know all these people are sitting with hundreds of millions of dollars or
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:16.920]  billions that could go into our economy to solve some of these problems or
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:22.400]  that having to to tax the poor people more Alan Greenspan was in CNBC this
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:28.960]  morning talking about taxes like they were when Mr. Clinton was in office top
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:34.720]  tax rate was 80 90% I mean what is this guy thinking about well they write the
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:39.000]  laws where they're a get it they're exempt with all this offshoring and they
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.120]  want to take our money and give it to them it's they want to destroy the poor
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:46.960]  people in the middle class and it ain't happening crooks you went too far we'll

[02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:48.840]  asking some of the questions and I'm sure you've got some other little tid bits
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:58.000]  that you want to get into or cover what's your take on the state of the union
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:02.720]  right now and then I want to get into all this hype about hacking happening by
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:06.000]  foreign governments right when they're trying to pass the cyber security act I
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:11.080]  predicted this would happen no doubt this is the false flag right on time the
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:14.760]  Chinese and the Russians attack right when the globalists are trying to pass
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:19.680]  this new global treaty to openly arrest people with no judge no jury five years
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:24.880]  in prison for embedding a YouTube video that's actually in the bill drudge has
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:31.920]  it linked today Bob what's your take it's not unexpected they will try to do
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:37.160]  what they can do to slow everything down and to be able to continue to continue
[02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:42.600]  to try to control what is said and what is done and these kinds of things are
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:46.960]  right throughout society you just mentioned the TSA experience in Texas
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:56.480]  we have squad teams the shooting people 64 times if you've ever shot people two
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:00.480]  or three times is usually sufficient I don't know what these policemen were
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:05.280]  thinking about one guy was around the house and ran around once with the
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:09.680]  Marine we now learn the gun was on safety dead in his own house and just wanted
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:14.840]  to get some and unloaded a few clips into him as well yeah that's right and
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:19.520]  guys this is not deer hunting this is not deer hunting even if somebody needs
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:24.640]  to be killed it's a solemn act sorry go ahead yeah well they think it's a party
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:31.520]  because they envisioned in their minds that this person was in fact a criminal
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:36.920]  simply because he had a gun and only the police should have them and I guess they
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:43.200]  picked certain types of people to be on those crews so to speak but that's a
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:50.360]  very very terrible act and these sort of things have got to stop because in
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:56.800]  the long run it's not only the victims it's also it's going to destroy the
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:00.560]  effectiveness of law enforcement I mean they're supposed to be there to help
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:04.960]  people not murder them yeah they're losing the moral high ground which the
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:09.160]  system wants so it's an us against them and then cops see reflected by the
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:16.120]  public the mistrust and and that's why more and more people are just tired of
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:19.200]  it and a lot of cops are starting to get killed and I don't think the police
[02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:22.320]  even though they feel like they're tough in their black uniforms really want to
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:26.560]  war with the American people I don't think that's gonna look too nice well we
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:31.440]  can't win them my goodness what is there a half a million of them there's 200
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:37.880]  million people in America know how to shoot you know case closed but you know
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:41.600]  there's all these other things that are going on that you mentioned during your
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:49.920]  show and it tends to continue to grind against the freedom of our country and
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:55.680]  it puts the average person on the defensive all the time I just talked to
[02:39:55.680 --> 02:40:05.200]  a man on a program and he is going to go from one city to another it's a two
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:12.600]  and a half three-hour drive I mean two and a half that day drive because his
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:16.920]  daughter is going to return to near where they are because she was offered a
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:22.640]  splendid job and he's got to go and drive with him because he's afraid not
[02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:28.240]  ever getting robbed or raped or murdered he's afraid of the police and that's not
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:34.200]  good and so we shouldn't have that kind of thing in America please should be
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:38.440]  there helping people not along the highway looking for prey you've got
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:42.440]  family that are police I mean I've got family that are police I mean this is
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:48.240]  not the way we want to go here not at all I mean we need the police we need
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:53.280]  people to get bad people and put them in jail I mean I don't want to go out and
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:58.760]  have to do that neither do you and it's not a nice job either it's a very very
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:03.160]  difficult job so we want to support them but you've got to get rid of those
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:07.560]  people are doing things like that it's got to stop and I heard a police chief
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:14.960]  on one of your tapes say well yeah we if they don't bring in the money from
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:20.160]  stopping these vehicles I guess this is Tennessee then yeah that we do let them
[02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:26.200]  go I mean I can't we're the police unions we're the police unions saying you
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:31.360]  can't order the officers to go rob people's wallets I mean what what I mean
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:37.480]  what's coming next you don't know but it it it'll reach a point where we'll get
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:43.560]  very dangerous for the police and and you know once 20 or 30 of them get killed
[02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:48.840]  of them maybe to get the message because there's lots of people out there who
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:53.280]  know how to handle weapons far better than they do well it's not just that
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:56.800]  there's a lot of people fed up who just don't care anymore and that's what's
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:01.320]  that in this country's going into depression there's war zones riots the
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:06.120]  killings are all increasing of citizens cops everybody we're going into a very
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:10.440]  dangerous time and I don't have some macho hair in me that hopes all this goes
[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:15.840]  nasty I want stability I want free market I want our Republic back and the
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:19.280]  globalists are going to sit back in their armored redoubts while we all kill
[02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:24.240]  each other I would rather it not go that direction Bob well I agree with you
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:29.120]  completely and let's hope that law enforcement management is listening and
[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:34.080]  they say no I gotta make sure this is not gonna happen in my department and he
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:37.920]  calls all the offices in and he says look we can't have that kind of thing
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:43.160]  going on you go out of your way to avoid that no shooting people 64 times
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:49.320]  etc etc etc and everybody knows what I'm talking about they had a straight enough
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:54.640]  and fly right and you know 85% of them are good people it's like any other
[02:42:54.640 --> 02:43:00.800]  profession 15% are ratty people whether they're stockbrokers or truck drivers
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:04.320]  or policemen it doesn't make any difference there's bad people in the
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:08.800]  world except a truck driver can't get away with doing bad stuff for long well
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:15.480]  he's got a big right now he's gonna put it yeah well the point is also we should
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:20.440]  talk a wee bit about Greece suppose yeah let's do that then go to calls let's do
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:26.640]  that yeah and we don't know what the particulars are unfortunately I'll get
[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:31.200]  this late this afternoon from all of our people in Greece and all over the
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:34.680]  weekend so I'm not gonna really tell you what the real story is of what
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:40.320]  probably will happen until Monday and you know you and I and Alex and a few
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:45.280]  others went on radio and television over there and I must say we had a we
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:49.880]  created a big impressing and people listened and I'm so glad we had that
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:55.400]  opportunity to be able to help because we are helping
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:44:01.880]  we'll continue then Bob break it down well I don't know what the deal is they're
[02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:09.720]  talking in terms of 70 billion dollars worth of assets being sold I don't think
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:15.800]  they should sell anything they went through a year of 35 to 40 percent less
[02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:23.480]  salaries and people who are retiring at 50 have to retire at 70 now and does a
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:30.520]  very very severe cuts business is almost non-existent we have subscribers who
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:36.160]  own businesses there big businesses as well as small ones and everybody's
[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:41.960]  hurting what they should have done is phased in the austerity over five years
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:49.880]  and state phased in tax increases over five years and that would have been far
[02:44:49.880 --> 02:44:55.360]  more acceptable because now if the people aren't making the money the revenue is
[02:44:55.360 --> 02:45:01.480]  coming in not coming in and so how can they pay the bills impossible and this
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:07.840]  is what the IMF and those people who don't care about the financial and
[02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:16.160]  economic resuscitation of Greece would do their GDP has fallen off a cliff and
[02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:22.800]  it's going to continue to stay there and any money that they give to them after
[02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:30.880]  they might sell off some of their assets let's say they get another 50 or a
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:35.880]  hundred billion dollars whatever it is it'll be gone in a year and they're
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:39.680]  going to be right back where they were before because of the approach that was
[02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:45.560]  taken and solving the problem mr. Samras who runs the opposition party has a
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:52.800]  great plan a plan similar to that and I think it'll work and I think if they
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:57.680]  try to put this thing through either one of two things could very well happen
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:03.640]  number one throwing the president out of office number two there could be a
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:09.280]  military coup and that country has known that before in 74 they had a military
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:12.600]  coup I don't know how many years are in it they were in power I think three or
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:18.000]  four and that was it but they caused a lot of damage because they didn't have
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:22.920]  experience in business and running those sort of things and and that's
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:29.480]  understandable so there's two sides to that but those kind of things can happen
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:35.200]  those people have fed up there's a hundred and fifty thousand plus people in
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:41.440]  the street every day there's been very little of any violence I have a link on
[02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:48.240]  that those demonstrations which you probably have in Spain people sitting
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:55.520]  and standing and doing nothing being attacked viciously by the police it was
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:47:01.600]  horrible I just couldn't believe what they were doing and breaking people's
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:08.560]  arms and legs and crushing their heads for no reason and so they keep that
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:13.120]  stuff up in Spain they will have a revolution oh it's gonna happen and all
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:17.120]  over the world the globalists have come in with continuity of agenda and trained
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:20.760]  cops to act like this because the criminals knew the economy was going
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:24.160]  to implode and now they're telling the police go do this or society will
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:29.480]  collapse society will collapse if we don't get these globalist parasites off
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:35.160]  our backs it's in their official IMF World Bank plans 2002 to do this by
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:40.560]  design get it join the right team people in government you idiots let's go
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:45.440]  ahead and talk to Aaron in Nevada Aaron you're on the air worldwide hey thank
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:48.960]  you very much good on the calm I got two comments at a question for each of you
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:55.720]  if it's okay go ahead okay all right the main thing we got to do here overall
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:48:02.280]  is change the messages running down through the chain of command number two
[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:10.040]  just like the founding fathers ultimate risk cannot be avoided to change or
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:15.560]  challenge the NWOs grand design you can't avoid it so question for you Bob I
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:19.320]  think there's a crossroads right now with a golden silver I'm gonna put you on
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:23.080]  the spot right here you had one to choose from this point forward to the end of
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:32.200]  the year gold or silver silver always says more leverage no question but I
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:38.920]  recommending fifty-fifty half of each in your investment portfolio and because I
[02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:43.120]  don't know and I don't think anybody else does exactly what's going to happen
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:47.640]  I mean we've got these ulterior forces of JP Morgan Chase he just to see
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:52.280]  Goldman Sachs city and the United States government historically QE three will
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:55.840]  only drive up commodities including golden silver that's right and that's a
[02:48:55.840 --> 02:49:00.080]  bottom line you're absolutely correct Alex in the final analysis no matter what
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:05.240]  they do that's what's going to happen let's talk and higher prices they can't
[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:08.880]  stop yeah and they can play games for a while but you watch the 12-year graph
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:12.880]  it it shows it goes down for a while but always up more after that because of the
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:17.240]  laws of finance and commodities Jack in Japan thanks for holding Jack you're on
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.160]  the air with Bob Chapman thanks Alex hey listen I know that you've been
[02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:24.560]  hammering the TSA and the global economy today but I'd like to change gears and
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:27.800]  talk about Fukushima if that's okay sir yeah it's just the radiation keeps
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:32.080]  exploding off the charts drifting across the US it's just absolutely horrible
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:38.640]  go ahead it is it is listen the Kyoto news agency here locally is reporting a
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:42.760]  new explosion as of May 31st at the number four reactor and that the building
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:45.720]  which is currently leaning or listing about eight degrees on the top two
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:50.240]  floors damaged apparently by the explosion of number three reactor this
[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:53.880]  is a particular import because it's in the number four reactor according to my
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:50:00.720]  research it holds the most and also the freshest spent fuel including plutonium
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:06.800]  that was confirmed we covered that earlier in the week and it's just
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:11.320]  unbelievable and it's much bigger than Chernobyl and our media isn't covering
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:15.360]  it and our government's raising the radiation levels and saying what's safe
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:20.960]  Bob Chapman I think you guys have covered that it's kind of out of my realm
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:25.200]  in a way I was on the phone with Tokyo this morning and I said what's gonna
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:30.320]  happen that they said to me well all they do is lie to us and so we don't know
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:40.320]  any more than you do everybody knows just just insane I mean at Chernobyl they
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:44.800]  had the kids not drink milk and in local produce for six months it's higher
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:48.840]  levels of radiation here now they just say hey it's nutritious eat it I mean
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:53.560]  things have really changed anything else from Japan sir well yeah the other
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:56.920]  thing I wanted to bring up is that there are places where you know the kids are
[02:50:56.920 --> 02:51:00.160]  getting out three militia which stay there stay there stay there let's break
[02:51:00.160 --> 02:51:03.520]  it down on the other side the largest part of gaining radiant health is

[02:53:55.160 --> 02:54:07.600]  800 624 1416 start taking osteo-k
[02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:11.760]  yeah it was over a month ago that the chief government scientist to the
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:17.560]  prime minister resigned and said that they're telling kids to stay just 10
[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:23.640]  kilometers away from Fukushima and that it will kill them all point up to wait
[02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:28.160]  more than a year they're gonna die and that the radiation just keeps building
[02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:34.360]  up it just keeps blooming out and piling up and I've seen the reports where
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:38.800]  they admit that it's it's it's it's it's devastation that can't even be
[02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:45.320]  described but that was the point you were getting at their Jack in Japan yeah
[02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:48.600]  I mean basically there's areas where they're getting three millisieverts per
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:53.040]  hour you calculate that out that's 525 chest x-rays per year and the
[02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:56.240]  government's response is that the kids should wear these little paper hay fever
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:01.200]  masks and long-sleeved shirts and so it's no surprise that in a recent
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:05.200]  mainstream media poll that over 80% of the people said that they did not
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:08.600]  believe that the government was selling them the full troops and that the
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:13.040]  Prime Minister Khan currently has a 1.37 approval rating according to how
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:19.160]  he's handling this this event and has promised to resign all right thank you
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:23.640]  so much for that let's go ahead and take another call here with Bob Chapman
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:29.160]  let's talk to Nathan and Pennsylvania Nathan you're on the air hi Alex I'm
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:35.160]  I'm a tool and I maker from Medi-ville Pennsylvania and you know I always hear
[02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:39.480]  the old guys say you know back in the day you could you could leave this job and
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:43.840]  go to another tool shop and make it a dollar or more if you wanted to you know
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:48.800]  it and they bit they yell about they're not being any jobs well why don't why
[02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:54.560]  didn't they ever ask any questions about where the jobs were going Bob Chapman
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:56:00.800]  comments yeah that's a good question I think it was beyond them most of them
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:08.240]  to understand I don't think that they had the kind of training and in fact I
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:12.560]  certainly don't think they had to have been identified what free trade
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:17.240]  globalization offshoring and outsourcing were all about and many many people with
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:21.680]  multiple degrees don't and they still don't it's about destroying the American
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:28.960]  economy and the victims it's not only on the tool tool and die-making now
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:35.360]  they're taking work away from attorneys and and even anesthesiologists and
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:42.320]  architects and of course you heard all about the call centers and so this
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:48.360]  destruction of the American economy is ongoing it just continues and everybody
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:54.560]  suffering you know we've lost 11 million jobs in 11 years to free free trade
