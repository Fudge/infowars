[00:00.000 --> 00:27.320]  Well, it wasn't a hard prediction to make in the last few weeks that when the United
[00:27.320 --> 00:32.120]  States openly said in a green-lit Ukraine to start firing cruise missiles deep into
[00:32.120 --> 00:38.520]  Russia attacking Russian nuclear bases, the Putin would then activate his mobile ICBMs
[00:38.520 --> 00:45.240]  that are on trains and trucks and begin moving them around at least twice a day.
[00:45.240 --> 00:50.600]  That way they can't be targeted by satellites and then first struck in a sneak attack nuclear
[00:50.600 --> 00:51.600]  attack.
[00:51.600 --> 00:56.480]  So Russia is now publicly prepared for the NATO-US-led nuclear sneak attack.
[00:56.480 --> 01:00.960]  China is saying they're going to respond with nuclear weapons, obviously if the war escalates
[01:00.960 --> 01:04.280]  in a nuclear war, do anybody attacks them?
[01:04.280 --> 01:08.520]  Things are deteriorating very, very, very quickly and the average person cares about
[01:08.520 --> 01:12.120]  what's going on on cable TV or on Netflix.
[01:12.120 --> 01:16.840]  This is how you sleepwalk into absolute Armageddon.
[01:16.840 --> 01:20.560]  So this goes way beyond saber-raddling.
[01:20.560 --> 01:26.400]  The Russians have rolled out their ICBMs that come back into the atmosphere at Mach 7, almost
[01:26.400 --> 01:28.880]  impossible to shoot down.
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.880]  The reentry devices when the warhead pops open or the shell of the missile pops open
[01:33.880 --> 01:40.200]  fire between five and 20 different warheads, some of them dummy decoys, some of them real,
[01:40.200 --> 01:43.360]  carrying thermonuclear payloads.
[01:43.360 --> 01:47.000]  And obviously the United States has all this stuff as well, but that's why they call it
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.080]  mutually assured destruction.
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.280]  Total complete insanity, that's coming up.
[01:55.280 --> 02:01.480]  And obviously we have a lot of border collapse news as they announced the end of Title 42.
[02:01.480 --> 02:05.600]  The feds admit they're expecting a total collapse, quote, calling it catastrophic, but it's being
[02:05.600 --> 02:09.800]  ordered by the same people, cutting off our energy supplies and bringing us into World
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.440]  War III and injecting the public with these poison Franken shots.
[02:13.440 --> 02:17.960]  And that's why we're going to hit the poison Franken shots first when we come back from
[02:17.960 --> 02:19.720]  break and some stations join us.
[02:19.720 --> 02:25.880]  Dr. Peter McCullough completely vindicated back on Twitter and so many other scientists
[02:25.880 --> 02:34.240]  and doctors now confirmed to be suppressed by Big Pharma and Fauci, criminally also suppressing
[02:34.240 --> 02:38.920]  many of the natural treatments and other therapeutics that were there.
[02:38.920 --> 02:42.240]  So I really appreciate Dr. McCullough joining us right at the main kickoff of the show here
[02:42.240 --> 02:45.920]  in about four minutes when we come back from this short break.
[02:45.920 --> 02:50.640]  But separately, we are listeners supported, we can't stay on air without you.
[02:50.640 --> 02:54.480]  And with all the crazy stuff going on in the world today, the fact that the public's
[02:54.480 --> 02:57.280]  returning to incubators with their immune systems lowered, it's more important than
[02:57.280 --> 03:01.480]  ever to boost your immune systems, but also just your basic way of life.
[03:01.480 --> 03:08.320]  We've now got M4's MD line of high quality supplements, the highest quality, nitric boost,
[03:08.320 --> 03:13.360]  naturally has compounds that boost nitrous oxide in your blood, which any doctor like
[03:13.360 --> 03:16.680]  Dr. Peter McCullough can tell you is really good for your cardiovascular system.
[03:16.680 --> 03:19.560]  It's amazing and it funds the heart of freedom.
[03:19.560 --> 03:23.720]  M4 Wars, mushroom max is a national best selling brand that we've been allowed to private
[03:23.720 --> 03:29.600]  label of the very best known rare mushroom concentrates that aren't speed like, but really
[03:29.600 --> 03:34.280]  have no new tropic effect like lion's mane and so many others.
[03:34.280 --> 03:35.840]  That's the new product.
[03:35.840 --> 03:39.080]  Mushroom boost is again a clone of an already best selling product that this company that's
[03:39.080 --> 03:44.120]  working with us puts out nationally, that's available at infowarstore.com.
[03:44.120 --> 03:48.760]  Libido RX takes a lot of natural healthy compounds that don't just boost your libido, but your
[03:48.760 --> 03:52.240]  overall stamina and energy and just well being.
[03:52.240 --> 03:56.440]  And then of course we also have turmeric 95, which is the same as body's ultimate turmeric
[03:56.440 --> 03:58.640]  formula, just their brand and under their label.
[03:58.640 --> 04:02.400]  That's who we were already buying it from, the 95% or 6% humanoid.
[04:02.400 --> 04:05.720]  That's the strongest humanoid out there, so good for inflammation, your immune system
[04:05.720 --> 04:06.720]  and more.
[04:06.720 --> 04:12.800]  Now turmeric 95, it's the same as body's ultimate turmeric formula, it's available at infowarstore.com
[04:12.800 --> 04:13.800]  back in stock.
[04:13.800 --> 04:18.520]  And that's great because our body's ultimate turmeric formula sold out about three weeks
[04:18.520 --> 04:21.320]  ago, as you know, it's one of our best sellers.
[04:21.320 --> 04:29.000]  There are also eight other new products available at infowarstore.com under the info wars MD
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.000]  banner.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.880]  These really are the best and they find the operation at very, very affordable prices.
[04:34.880 --> 04:40.480]  And then I talked about how the mushroom concentrate boosts your overall well being.
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.760]  What about your libido with libido RX with all the known compounds that actually and healthily
[04:44.760 --> 04:47.520]  supercharge your libido, this stuff's powerful.
[04:47.520 --> 04:50.800]  And I suggest you all get it at infowarstore.com.
[04:50.800 --> 05:00.800]  Right back with Dr. Peter McCullough, infowars.com and band.video, please share those links.

[06:06.040 --> 06:22.240]  to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones well the global
[06:22.240 --> 06:27.840]  big pharma mafia that's trying to take over medicine trying to bring back new viruses
[06:27.840 --> 06:33.320]  new lock downs new moves to take control of our bodies and there have been so many prominent
[06:33.320 --> 06:39.160]  scientists and doctors and medical workers that have valiantly exposed what's happening
[06:39.160 --> 06:44.080]  whistle blow you name it but out of all of them Dr. Peter McCullough a very respected
[06:44.080 --> 06:50.600]  already well known doctor and researcher has been the very tip of the spear in the last
[06:50.600 --> 06:54.400]  two and a half three years exposing this he was already going to join us in studio next
[06:54.400 --> 06:58.200]  week and I believe that's still going to happen he's in Texas as well but he's on the road
[06:58.200 --> 07:04.440]  these huge symposiums and events and Senator Ron Johnson's hearings he's been having but
[07:04.440 --> 07:09.720]  I wanted to get him on because he's been restored to Twitter absolutely vindicated and we now
[07:09.720 --> 07:18.440]  know what was going on behind the scenes illegal mass coordinated censorship with big pharma
[07:18.440 --> 07:24.560]  and the government with big tech so it doesn't get more criminal than that and now Governor
[07:24.560 --> 07:30.880]  Ron DeSantis has been paneled a criminal statewide grand jury to begin to investigate the crimes
[07:30.880 --> 07:35.520]  of big pharma government officials you name it so Rand Paul just three weeks ago called
[07:35.520 --> 07:40.400]  for Fauci's arrest I've been calling for it for years we now know this was premeditated
[07:40.400 --> 07:43.600]  there's a clip I'll play a little bit later but he's going to leave us here about 20 minutes
[07:43.600 --> 07:48.920]  where Dr. Peter McCullough made the point this is going to go down in history as the biggest
[07:48.920 --> 07:55.520]  biological pharmacological safety disaster in the history of mankind should it give us
[07:55.520 --> 07:59.880]  a quick synopsis usually here for two hours it covers the waterfront of the current state
[07:59.880 --> 08:04.320]  of things these big developments is Dr. Peter McCullough thank you Dr. it's safe to say you
[08:04.320 --> 08:10.240]  and many others aren't as vindicated this is blown up in the deep state's face why Alex
[08:10.240 --> 08:15.600]  first I'd say that you're vindicated man you made the right call I've known you now for
[08:15.600 --> 08:21.440]  three years through the pandemic and you've made the right call all the way and and just
[08:21.440 --> 08:29.680]  the developing breaking news now occurring almost every minute is stunning two days ago
[08:29.680 --> 08:35.280]  I was invited to go onto a Twitter chat I think with Sebastian Gorka who invited me on I saw
[08:35.280 --> 08:42.640]  him as one of 6,000 people on the chat I uploaded a survey that someone had done 98% of people
[08:42.640 --> 08:48.600]  wanted me back on Twitter and so I submitted it and then within a few hours I'm back on
[08:48.600 --> 08:56.360]  Twitter and I've requested for now dozens of times that they stop the blacklisting the
[08:56.360 --> 09:02.280]  unfollow in the shadow banning of my account and just let my account just be a natural
[09:02.280 --> 09:08.000]  account like anyone else's and you know what Alex overnight I had 100,000 new followers
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.520]  my following now is skyrocketing I've always tweeted graphical abstracts in advancements
[09:14.520 --> 09:21.720]  that's going on today I've retweeted Andrew Bridgen Andrew Bridgen is a conservative member
[09:21.720 --> 09:28.240]  of parliament in the UK and he's calling to pull all the vaccines off the market Alex
[09:28.240 --> 09:33.960]  pull them all this is a member of parliament while respected we're going to see this worldwide
[09:33.960 --> 09:40.560]  and we actually had that video I'm going to play it after you leave us some kind of retroactively
[09:40.560 --> 09:44.640]  creative videography of what you're breaking down but he also talks in his speech to parliament
[09:44.640 --> 09:48.920]  about how he's talked to high level whistleblowers that have confirmed that they've been ordered
[09:48.920 --> 09:56.160]  to cover up the evidence of heart damage caused by these shots it's coming out we recently
[09:56.160 --> 10:03.760]  had a chance to spend time with UK leading cardiologist Asim Malhotra and so we had a
[10:03.760 --> 10:09.120]  program in the Dallas Arboretum for the vaccine safety research foundation and then I appeared
[10:09.120 --> 10:14.960]  in a Malibu private event with Robert F. Kennedy and Malhotra who's a very thoughtful young
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.520]  man it's a tragedy that his father took the vaccine his father's very prominent doctor
[10:20.520 --> 10:27.120]  and died as a consequence of taking the vaccine Malhotra did his own research published to
[10:27.120 --> 10:31.880]  a very high quality peer reviewed manuscripts looking at all the data and concluding that
[10:31.880 --> 10:38.400]  the vaccines are simply unsafe for use and they don't work they don't stop COVID-19 we
[10:38.400 --> 10:43.880]  see other people stepping forward European member of parliament Christine Anderson who
[10:43.880 --> 10:52.000]  is calling this entire COVID-19 vaccine program a fraud we have member of parliament Roos
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.640]  from the Netherlands who's called out the Pfizer executive who now admits you know under
[10:57.640 --> 11:02.080]  testimony in the European Parliament that Pfizer was never tested to see if it would
[11:02.080 --> 11:09.360]  stop transmission of the virus and so we have a situation now Alex as you called it
[11:09.360 --> 11:16.920]  it's imploding it's imploding worldwide and we put a punctuation mark on this on December
[11:16.920 --> 11:26.040]  7th 2022 in the US Senate special panel held by Ron Johnson how big is this to have Governor
[11:26.040 --> 11:32.640]  DeSantis in paneling a statewide task force of grand juries to investigate every aspect
[11:32.640 --> 11:37.960]  the government the censorship the big pharma lying I mean they've all obviously committed
[11:37.960 --> 11:43.480]  crimes it's open and shut just like with Sam bankman freed it's just open and shut what
[11:43.480 --> 11:47.880]  do you what do you make of that a and b what do you think the deep states response is
[11:47.880 --> 11:56.200]  going to be I tell you the deep state has to be extremely worried because there are
[11:56.200 --> 12:01.640]  state actors involved those that are not government officials but many of the people
[12:01.640 --> 12:07.160]  involved will be government officials and it goes to show when a state has a strong
[12:07.160 --> 12:14.840]  attorney general my colleague Joe Ledapo MD PhD Harvard trained is DeSantis's right hand
[12:14.840 --> 12:20.640]  man on medical affairs you know in Texas else we don't have a surgeon general and I think
[12:20.640 --> 12:27.760]  it's a giant mistake for a state to have no doctor in charge it's ridiculous yeah and
[12:27.760 --> 12:34.360]  Ledapo has been terrific he supported DeSantis and it's now clear they're going to go after
[12:34.360 --> 12:39.920]  areas of wrongful advertising we can just take that one advertising for pharmaceuticals
[12:39.920 --> 12:44.600]  is governed by the Landman Act the U.S. Drug and Cosmetic Act and they even advertise
[12:44.600 --> 12:49.680]  it before it was emergency approved for children they advertised ads on Sesame Street that's
[12:49.680 --> 12:54.640]  illegal isn't it yeah it's illegal and as a fact it you know you know when any drug
[12:54.640 --> 12:59.440]  is advertised on TV there's all the disclaimers of the side effects but they're not giving
[12:59.440 --> 13:04.720]  any of the disclaimers of the side effects on the COVID-19 vaccines everybody should
[13:04.720 --> 13:08.800]  view that as being illegal and you know in the state of Kansas they've already taken
[13:08.800 --> 13:16.360]  action and pulled all the vaccine ads off TV we know now Alex this is a stunning revelation
[13:16.360 --> 13:22.880]  that the U.S. Health and Human Services and the White House had a program called the COVID
[13:22.880 --> 13:31.040]  Community Corps the COVID Community Corps and that program infused over 13 billion dollars
[13:31.040 --> 13:38.880]  to 276 agencies it's on their website a COVID Community Corps and there the money flowed
[13:38.880 --> 13:44.200]  to all the medical societies the American Association of Pediatrics American College
[13:44.200 --> 13:49.440]  of Pediatrics American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology the American Medical Association
[13:49.440 --> 13:57.840]  it flowed to churches black and Hispanic groups Hollywood the sports teams like the NFL these
[13:57.840 --> 14:03.880]  are massive amounts of money and so this is the largest government bribe in history and
[14:03.880 --> 14:10.360]  that explains why obstetricians and gynecologists went along with vaccination in pregnant women
[14:10.360 --> 14:16.920]  they were bribed by the U.S. government I want to continue with the 35,000 foot viewer
[14:16.920 --> 14:21.960]  still a few minutes to break but just continuing 35,000 foot view the whole world's waking
[14:21.960 --> 14:27.320]  up and turning against this how do you see this unfolding now what we're going to see
[14:27.320 --> 14:33.440]  is we're going to see continued pockets now of leadership I mentioned Senator Ron Johnson
[14:33.440 --> 14:39.840]  who's been absolutely the leader in the United States holding yet another Senate panel December
[14:39.840 --> 14:45.280]  close session was December 6 open session December 7 I moderate it you see me sitting
[14:45.280 --> 14:52.960]  on Johnson's left esteemed panel of expert doctors vaccine consultants lawyers patients
[14:52.960 --> 14:57.680]  and others and the title of the program was COVID-19 vaccines what are they how do they
[14:57.680 --> 15:04.600]  work and what are the safety concerns and we got it all out in the open the conclusion
[15:04.600 --> 15:10.400]  and I gave it for the panel conclusion was pull the vaccines off the market they should
[15:10.400 --> 15:15.760]  have been pulled off before February of 2021 it's gone on too long and these pockets by
[15:15.760 --> 15:21.760]  the way it wasn't just Senator Johnson Senator Roger Marshall from Kansas joined us so Johnson
[15:21.760 --> 15:30.360]  has helped we've seen now a new prime minister of Alberta Canada she's clearly breaking rank
[15:30.360 --> 15:38.280]  we've mentioned Andrew Bidgen in the in the UK Malcolm Roberts in Australia and former
[15:38.280 --> 15:42.080]  member of Parliament Craig Kelly I'm going to go all right Dr. Peter McCullough please

[20:05.740 --> 20:07.460]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:14.980 --> 20:18.340]  Final segment with the completely vindicated tip of the spear,
[20:18.340 --> 20:22.820]  Dr. Peter McCullough, then coming up, ladies and gentlemen,
[20:22.820 --> 20:26.780]  the Economist, the stock trader, so well known, Edward Dowd,
[20:26.780 --> 20:30.980]  can document not just that there is global mass death from these
[20:30.980 --> 20:35.500]  shots, but also that there is a coordinated worldwide economic
[20:35.500 --> 20:38.900]  collapse. We'll single out who's doing it and what's coming
[20:38.900 --> 20:41.420]  next and how to stop them. Next hour, I'm going to get into
[20:41.420 --> 20:44.180]  Russia threatening new levels of nuclear war, the U.S.
[20:44.180 --> 20:46.540]  greenlighting attacks inside Russia. It is just completely
[20:46.540 --> 20:49.060]  insane. Coming up next segment after I play a few of the
[20:49.060 --> 20:52.020]  videos that Dr. McCullough mentioned after he leaves, but I
[20:52.020 --> 20:55.780]  want those on the record. It's such big news. But I was
[20:55.780 --> 20:57.700]  asking Dr. McCullough wanting to get to next, and he said,
[20:57.700 --> 21:00.500]  let's talk about how unprecedented three journalists,
[21:00.540 --> 21:04.820]  not that old, dying at the World Cup, they first said, oh, they
[21:04.820 --> 21:08.260]  must be supporting gays is why they're dead. No, we're now
[21:08.260 --> 21:12.460]  getting the coroner's reports, exploding arteries, exploding
[21:12.460 --> 21:15.980]  aortas, heart attacks, one of them, sports reporter Grant
[21:15.980 --> 21:19.820]  Wall died of an aortic, that's your big artery coming on top
[21:19.820 --> 21:24.620]  of your heart aneurysm at World Cup. So Dr. McCullough, we're
[21:24.620 --> 21:25.660]  seeing a lot of this, aren't we?
[21:27.340 --> 21:31.700]  We are a semi substack that there can be what's called aortic
[21:31.700 --> 21:35.900]  dissection and rupture after COVID-19 vaccination. We know
[21:35.900 --> 21:39.940]  that the vaccine does induce tremendous surges in blood
[21:39.940 --> 21:44.660]  pressure, vascular strain. I mean, this is a young man. This is
[21:44.660 --> 21:48.900]  not the picture of someone who would die of an aneurysmal
[21:48.900 --> 21:53.700]  rupture. This is in my view, just like the other two that have
[21:53.700 --> 21:58.260]  died there. It's due to the COVID-19 vaccine until proven
[21:58.260 --> 22:01.020]  otherwise. And so it's pretty clear that the family wants to
[22:01.020 --> 22:03.900]  clear it up. They can come out and tell us if they haven't taken
[22:03.900 --> 22:07.740]  the vaccine, we can rule it out. But now that autopsy study
[22:07.740 --> 22:12.460]  after autopsy studies shows that in fact, the vaccines are the
[22:12.460 --> 22:15.660]  cause of death. The recent one by by Schwaben colleagues from
[22:15.660 --> 22:20.220]  Heidelberg, Germany, showed that in people who died within 20
[22:20.260 --> 22:23.740]  days of taking the vaccine, they were found dead at home. Alex,
[22:23.980 --> 22:32.620]  71% had a clear agreed upon vaccine induced cause of death,
[22:32.620 --> 22:36.020]  heart damage, a blood clot, neurologic damage. These are not
[22:36.020 --> 22:40.140]  controversial. The FDA says they can happen. The autopsy study
[22:40.300 --> 22:43.660]  are showing that it happens. And when people die after taking the
[22:43.660 --> 22:47.380]  vaccine, it is due to the vaccine until proven otherwise.
[22:49.020 --> 22:52.380]  You were on my show two and a half years ago, even before the
[22:52.380 --> 22:54.820]  CDC put the document on warning of heart attacks and blood
[22:54.820 --> 22:58.620]  clots, we know from the research of similar vaccine trials or
[22:58.620 --> 23:01.900]  mRNA shots in in lab rats and other things that this was
[23:01.940 --> 23:05.740]  happening. So if you knew if the CDC knew on their own website,
[23:05.980 --> 23:09.740]  why did they then roll this out? I mean, there's obviously a
[23:09.740 --> 23:12.980]  premeditated nature to this. I know probably a few years ago,
[23:12.980 --> 23:15.460]  you can find that's where you thought it was going. Now you've
[23:15.460 --> 23:19.540]  been a lot more bold about the master plan, the 50,000 foot
[23:19.540 --> 23:20.460]  view on this doc.
[23:21.940 --> 23:25.300]  You know, we have records now Ralph Barrick at the University
[23:25.300 --> 23:28.140]  of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, the most knowledgeable person on
[23:28.140 --> 23:31.980]  coronavirus, also the quietest person over the last three
[23:31.980 --> 23:35.900]  years. He was a DARPA and BARDA consultant and researcher had
[23:35.900 --> 23:40.820]  won millions of dollars in grants. He showed in 1992 that beta
[23:40.820 --> 23:45.020]  coronavirus is given in high enough dosage could cause myocarditis
[23:45.020 --> 23:49.100]  in animal models. So that's the reason why we knew COVID itself
[23:49.340 --> 23:53.060]  could cause myocarditis and that's the reason why the NCAA
[23:53.060 --> 23:56.500]  Big 10 had a myocarditis screening program in 2020 with
[23:56.500 --> 24:01.300]  COVID. So to the military, they found very few cases of myocarditis.
[24:01.500 --> 24:04.340]  So they packed up their screening programs. And once the
[24:04.340 --> 24:07.820]  vaccines were started, that's when the damage really happened.
[24:07.820 --> 24:11.780]  And no one was looking for it. You know, this is a tragedy.
[24:11.780 --> 24:16.340]  What's gone on now two papers, one by Mansookian and the other
[24:16.340 --> 24:21.460]  one by La Pesic show that about 2.5% of people who take a
[24:21.460 --> 24:26.340]  vaccine develop heart damage 50% of the time they can't feel it.
[24:26.660 --> 24:30.980]  And the first manifestation is sudden cardiac arrest, two
[24:30.980 --> 24:34.740]  points in timeouts, usually during sleep from three to six
[24:34.740 --> 24:37.980]  a.m. and during sports activities. And that's where
[24:37.980 --> 24:42.180]  there is a surge in internal adrenaline, which is the trigger
[24:42.180 --> 24:45.060]  for sudden cardiac death and someone who's had some clinical
[24:45.060 --> 24:46.020]  myocarditis.
[24:46.620 --> 24:49.300]  There's so many points to hit you'll be with us next Tuesday,
[24:49.300 --> 24:52.700]  actually remotely we'll cover the waterfront. But I know the
[24:52.700 --> 24:54.940]  general audience listens to you, they know about all this, they're
[24:54.940 --> 24:57.820]  like, Why are you telling us again? Well, because a lot of
[24:57.820 --> 25:00.380]  people still don't know and they're going to try to push this
[25:00.380 --> 25:02.100]  whole agenda. They're still trying to make the military
[25:02.100 --> 25:04.620]  take it blue cities are still trying to make the children take
[25:04.620 --> 25:07.540]  it. This fight is far from over. We're starting to win. We're
[25:07.540 --> 25:09.460]  getting major attraction, but don't we need to push harder
[25:09.460 --> 25:09.980]  than ever?
[25:11.540 --> 25:15.300]  We do. It's clear, you know, I gave a press interview outside
[25:15.300 --> 25:19.500]  my hotel in Washington before I testified in the Senate. And,
[25:19.540 --> 25:22.740]  you know, one of the workers who worked at the hotel, she came
[25:22.740 --> 25:25.500]  up to me, she goes, What's all this about? I said, we're, you
[25:25.500 --> 25:28.980]  know, we're concerned about the vaccines that cause blood clots
[25:28.980 --> 25:32.500]  and heart damage. And she goes, I took two of these, I had no idea.
[25:32.900 --> 25:36.460]  So Alex, there are still people out there that have no idea
[25:36.460 --> 25:40.060]  they're just, you know, in their usual walks of life. And our
[25:40.060 --> 25:43.980]  government has betrayed them. Our government is not warning
[25:43.980 --> 25:47.700]  people what can happen with these shots. And the same people
[25:47.700 --> 25:50.500]  doing this, even if somebody's a sociopath that doesn't care
[25:50.500 --> 25:52.900]  about folks getting hurt, just because you know it's hurting
[25:52.900 --> 25:55.500]  you, you don't do it. It's going to break down society, the
[25:55.500 --> 25:57.780]  same people doing it are going to expand this, they're going to
[25:57.780 --> 26:01.060]  make it forced. They already are. We've got to stop this now.
[26:01.260 --> 26:03.180]  And the last three minutes we have left, I know you wanted to
[26:03.180 --> 26:06.980]  hit on how big the Twitter files are and why Fauci is really
[26:06.980 --> 26:09.500]  so scared. And now the White House is saying he's sacrosanct,
[26:09.780 --> 26:12.900]  cannot be criticized. So he says he's science. I thought the
[26:12.900 --> 26:16.300]  nature of science was challenged. Fauci is really
[26:16.300 --> 26:18.020]  concerned right now. What do you expect to come out of these
[26:18.020 --> 26:18.660]  Twitter files?
[26:19.740 --> 26:23.420]  The Twitter files are going to be a bombshell. There's no
[26:23.420 --> 26:26.500]  doubt about it. We learned through American First Legal that
[26:26.500 --> 26:30.740]  the CDC was actively meeting with Twitter, figuring out which
[26:30.740 --> 26:34.700]  accounts is censor, shadow ban, how to channel information to
[26:34.700 --> 26:38.660]  give a message that's only positive on the vaccines that
[26:38.660 --> 26:42.940]  is to suppress any information on treatment. Look at 98% of
[26:42.940 --> 26:46.260]  people wanted me on Twitter, Alex, it's clear that I was
[26:46.260 --> 26:51.140]  giving the world a fair balanced analysis of what's going on.
[26:51.580 --> 26:55.300]  And you're right. Yesterday, Anthony Fauci said that Twitter
[26:55.300 --> 26:59.180]  is a, quote, cesspool of information. Well, I can tell
[26:59.180 --> 27:02.660]  you, the CDC was taking Twitter very seriously. It wasn't a
[27:02.660 --> 27:06.340]  cesspool at all. In fact, it was a valuable source of
[27:06.340 --> 27:10.060]  scientific information. And then finally, I've had my day and
[27:10.060 --> 27:13.060]  I'm back on Twitter, I'm going to help other scientists go on.
[27:13.220 --> 27:16.500]  You know, Jay Badachara, who's in my frequent contributor group
[27:16.500 --> 27:20.860]  at Fox News, Jay was invited to go into the Twitter headquarters.
[27:21.060 --> 27:24.820]  And hopefully, he made an impact. I think he did. Now, Jay has
[27:24.820 --> 27:27.700]  been one of the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration.
[27:27.700 --> 27:30.460]  He's really been focused on public health measures,
[27:30.460 --> 27:35.140]  lockdowns, masks and just appropriate precautions for
[27:35.140 --> 27:39.540]  our seniors. But Badachara has been directly attacked by Fauci.
[27:40.220 --> 27:43.420]  Badachara must have made the case to let myself, other
[27:43.420 --> 27:46.660]  eminent scientists back on Twitter. And I'm going to
[27:46.660 --> 27:52.020]  continue the same, just bringing the world the truth. And, you
[27:52.020 --> 27:54.420]  know, I reflexively do it across all the platforms. I've
[27:54.420 --> 27:58.100]  built up getter, truth, social, sub-stack and telegram.
[27:58.220 --> 28:01.780]  All right, well, regardless of Musk isn't letting me back. He's
[28:01.780 --> 28:05.100]  still a hero for what he's doing. I cannot deny the fruits of
[28:05.100 --> 28:07.780]  the tree. And I like the direction he's moving in. So we
[28:07.780 --> 28:09.740]  should all support him in exactly meeting with prominent,
[28:09.740 --> 28:12.820]  respected scientists. And then freeing the other prominent
[28:12.820 --> 28:16.380]  scientists is critical to freedom on this planet, Dr. Peter
[28:16.380 --> 28:19.300]  McCullough. I really appreciate you. People can find you at
[28:19.300 --> 28:22.380]  DrPeterMcCulloughMD.com. I know you've also launched with
[28:22.380 --> 28:27.300]  some prominent folks on one stop online medical consultation
[28:27.300 --> 28:29.780]  and prescription system. But I know we're really promoting.
[28:29.780 --> 28:30.740]  How do people find that?
[28:31.900 --> 28:36.300]  It's the wellness company. It is a nationwide alternative health
[28:36.300 --> 28:42.020]  system platform. Go to twc.health. Sign up. It's $10 a
[28:42.020 --> 28:45.780]  month for the cell phone app, access to doctors, medications,
[28:46.060 --> 28:49.420]  exemptions from taking the vaccine. This is what a lot of
[28:49.420 --> 28:52.540]  people are looking for. Alex, your show has been a wonderful
[28:52.540 --> 28:55.260]  supporter. That's right. The truth will set us free. Thank you,
[28:55.260 --> 28:57.780]  Dr. Talk to you next Tuesday. Thank you.

[32:00.100 --> 32:04.100]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to
[32:04.100 --> 32:08.780]  introduce to you the wellness company. An alternative healthcare
[32:08.780 --> 32:13.540]  system for this COVID and post COVID world where trust has been

[32:20.660 --> 32:25.620]  platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual
[32:25.620 --> 32:29.580]  appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics,
[32:29.580 --> 32:35.620]  prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID post
[32:35.620 --> 32:40.020]  COVID vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are
[32:40.020 --> 32:45.300]  seen in primary care. And then we have an entire array of
[32:45.300 --> 32:51.260]  holistic products and online store media and health advice. Come
[32:51.260 --> 32:57.060]  see the wellness company and go to online health now.com as a
[32:57.060 --> 33:02.900]  conduit to the wellness company. Leading a frontal assault on
[33:02.900 --> 33:28.900]  the lives of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[33:32.900 --> 33:43.900]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[33:43.900 --> 33:48.900]  in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:48.900 --> 33:55.100]  Let that sink in for the best there is. And I say that very
[33:55.100 --> 33:59.500]  humbly, because I'm not that good at it. But we're all we got. I
[33:59.500 --> 34:02.860]  know you're humble as well, but you understand as viewers and
[34:02.860 --> 34:07.340]  listeners of this broadcast, you are the heart of the awakening.
[34:07.340 --> 34:10.060]  You are the heart of the knowledge of how to address the
[34:10.060 --> 34:12.420]  New World Order, how to stop the New World Order and how to build
[34:12.420 --> 34:17.420]  a new, better future for our species with God's divine
[34:17.420 --> 34:22.220]  intervention. Look, obviously, the big news today is the
[34:22.220 --> 34:24.940]  escalation in Russia. And I just keep every week reporting out
[34:24.940 --> 34:28.420]  the escalation gets worse and more out of control. And we're
[34:28.420 --> 34:32.460]  officially at war with Russia and the US is helping bomb Russia
[34:32.460 --> 34:38.380]  and Russia is now readying its mobile nukes. This is a global
[34:38.380 --> 34:43.420]  emergency alert. Russia ready ICBMs threatens to nuke West after
[34:43.420 --> 34:49.660]  US green lights missile attacks on Russia. This is insanity. But
[34:49.660 --> 34:54.260]  why am I spending so much time on the poison shots? Because it's
[34:54.260 --> 34:57.780]  the globalists that are the dominant power group in the
[34:57.780 --> 35:03.580]  world. Allied with the chai comms at one level that are rolling
[35:03.580 --> 35:06.700]  these deadly shots out to collapse civilization. And if we
[35:06.700 --> 35:10.340]  can stop that aspect of the attack, we derail their whole
[35:10.340 --> 35:14.380]  operation. It's very hard to get the public that's grown up
[35:14.380 --> 35:16.860]  relatively safe and free compared to what we're about to
[35:16.860 --> 35:21.100]  be about nuclear war and oh, you know, war in Russia war in
[35:21.100 --> 35:25.740]  Ukraine, in Central Europe and Eastern Europe. What's the big
[35:25.740 --> 35:29.420]  deal? It's like another planet, but it's not another planet.
[35:30.460 --> 35:37.580]  It's only four or 5,000 miles away. So I've been hammering the
[35:37.580 --> 35:40.060]  poison shots because that someplace we're getting something
[35:40.060 --> 35:46.380]  done. The situation with the United States and our troops
[35:46.380 --> 35:50.060]  over there fighting the Russians for years. But now it's
[35:50.060 --> 35:58.460]  official is something that really makes me have anxiety. And
[35:58.460 --> 36:02.220]  few things do. Because it's so dangerous. It's so needless.
[36:02.220 --> 36:05.860]  It's so reckless. And the corrupt, decadent people running our
[36:05.860 --> 36:11.060]  world get off on this and they enjoy the brinksmanship and the
[36:11.060 --> 36:14.260]  danger. That's why people go and they gamble. They like to see
[36:14.260 --> 36:17.060]  the roulette wheel and they like to see the cards dealt and it
[36:17.060 --> 36:21.260]  gives people excitement and releases dopamine in the brain. And
[36:21.260 --> 36:23.180]  as long as you're not a degenerate gambler, you do it for
[36:23.180 --> 36:26.980]  fun. It's not a bad thing. But we know it has a dangerous side.
[36:27.580 --> 36:30.620]  Well, war just goes from bad to worse. And it's the ultimate
[36:30.620 --> 36:37.100]  drug. And we need to warn everybody we know about the
[36:37.100 --> 36:39.700]  situation. We need to lay out how serious it is in the history
[36:39.700 --> 36:45.060]  of it and where it's obviously going. And we need to get right
[36:45.060 --> 36:47.620]  with God. I want to get back to the poison shots that I'm going
[36:47.620 --> 36:52.980]  to get into this news on the Russia, Ukraine escalation. But
[36:52.980 --> 36:55.740]  first, I just want to encourage listeners to protect yourselves
[36:55.740 --> 36:59.420]  and to boost your immune systems and to be healthier and to lead
[36:59.420 --> 37:03.220]  better lives. And a great way to do that is with high quality
[37:03.220 --> 37:06.100]  supplementation. And all the products we sell are top of the
[37:06.100 --> 37:10.420]  line, the best, the purest, the strongest, the cleanest. And you
[37:10.420 --> 37:13.100]  get discounts on them from where you would get them other
[37:13.100 --> 37:17.100]  places because almost all of our products except for x2 x3 DNA
[37:17.100 --> 37:22.540]  force and a few others are not proprietary. They're just private
[37:22.540 --> 37:25.740]  labels of already best selling products that are highly rated
[37:25.740 --> 37:29.060]  and from the best companies. And we were already getting the best
[37:29.060 --> 37:31.980]  supplements. But now we've broken through on two fronts to the
[37:31.980 --> 37:36.020]  actual two big national makers where we were already getting our
[37:36.020 --> 37:39.340]  raw material from through other large companies, but but they
[37:39.340 --> 37:43.820]  were middlemen. And so the first of 10 products just rolled out
[37:43.820 --> 37:48.220]  that are new info wars MD, and they're just incredible. This
[37:48.220 --> 37:52.420]  is 95% turmeric. That's what's called turmeric 95. The strongest
[37:52.420 --> 37:54.460]  consumer oil you can get unbelievable what it does for
[37:54.460 --> 37:58.540]  your inflammation, your cells, your immune system. It's just so
[37:58.540 --> 38:03.060]  important. Especially in the winter months with what's going
[38:03.060 --> 38:07.900]  on. So turmeric 95 discounted out of the gates info war store
[38:07.900 --> 38:12.180]  dot com. I'm not going to go over all the ingredients folks.
[38:12.260 --> 38:14.980]  Nitric boost has a bunch of known natural compounds that
[38:14.980 --> 38:19.100]  massively boost nitrous oxide in your blood that is so good for
[38:19.100 --> 38:21.260]  cleaning out your arteries and making your heart be healthy.
[38:21.460 --> 38:24.700]  Everybody should be taking this especially folks 40 or older.
[38:24.900 --> 38:30.020]  It's now available. We also have mushroom max, which is a clone
[38:30.020 --> 38:34.140]  of one of the best selling national brands of known rare
[38:34.140 --> 38:39.140]  mushroom concentrates that do incredible things for the mind
[38:39.380 --> 38:42.860]  and for mental clarity and focus without a stimulant or
[38:42.860 --> 38:48.180]  or amphetamine driver. So mushroom max is a very, very popular
[38:48.180 --> 38:51.540]  product sold by a lot of people under several different names.
[38:51.580 --> 38:53.660]  And it's you say, Well, why private label, why not make your
[38:53.660 --> 38:55.620]  own thing? When something's already the highest rated or the
[38:55.620 --> 38:58.820]  best, you just get that. So it's probably able by us, you get it
[38:59.300 --> 39:02.820]  guaranteed lower than anybody else is selling it. So that's
[39:02.820 --> 39:08.140]  available as well. And then we have libido rx. Now, this is a
[39:08.140 --> 39:10.820]  bunch of natural compounds. There's like one, two, three,
[39:10.820 --> 39:13.620]  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
[39:13.620 --> 39:19.260]  different things in this. And personally, this works for me
[39:19.580 --> 39:23.420]  way better than something like Cialis or Viagra. And not that
[39:23.420 --> 39:25.700]  I need it, but you get older, you go for your yearly check up
[39:25.700 --> 39:29.660]  the doctor goes, Hey, you want some Cialis? No, okay. It's
[39:29.660 --> 39:32.740]  like, Wow, I don't really have any issues. But this is this
[39:32.740 --> 39:35.740]  something else, you know, the we're adults here, folks, but
[39:35.780 --> 39:39.340]  the misses certainly isn't upset about it. This has a bigger
[39:39.340 --> 39:44.980]  effect for me than that. And I remember being like 16, and you
[39:44.980 --> 39:51.580]  would have painful erections. So look out, all of these ladies
[39:51.580 --> 39:55.700]  and gentlemen are are really powerful. And are the real deal.
[39:55.740 --> 39:59.380]  So be careful with it all. There's six other products as
[39:59.380 --> 40:03.100]  well. They don't have a lot of the CBD. That's all selling out
[40:03.100 --> 40:05.780]  as we speak. It's amazing, high quality, very low price as
[40:05.780 --> 40:08.700]  well. We'll have more of that in the new year. And a lot of this
[40:08.700 --> 40:10.980]  stuff is selling out. We also have vitamin mineral fusion
[40:11.140 --> 40:13.260]  selling out very soon. Despite that, it's an excellent
[40:13.260 --> 40:17.380]  formula. We're still going to keep it discounted. 50% off at
[40:17.380 --> 40:20.860]  infowarstore.com. But this is how we find the operation and it
[40:20.860 --> 40:24.260]  makes your life better. And I don't like your little caddy
[40:24.260 --> 40:28.180]  getting into what libido rx does, but it's just amazing. And
[40:28.180 --> 40:30.260]  each formula is different. You know, supermodality is great,
[40:30.260 --> 40:33.700]  but it's a different driver. And then you've got things like
[40:33.700 --> 40:36.460]  that. But libido rx is really, really amazing. And they all
[40:36.460 --> 40:39.580]  complement each other infowarstore.com or triple eight

[40:49.420 --> 40:51.500]  two years of appeals, he's going to win the appeals, there's no
[40:51.500 --> 40:54.140]  way we can't give you the money for the appeals. So we're not
[40:54.140 --> 40:59.340]  going anywhere. And that's the reality of this. And we just need

[41:09.460 --> 41:14.300]  number one bestseller. It was in the top 10 for like three, four
[41:14.300 --> 41:18.460]  months. It really is powerful. It's a good read a riveting read
[41:18.460 --> 41:20.820]  it's all documented. You want to know about the new world order

[41:44.300 --> 41:48.700]  excuse me, I was eating some almonds during the break. Got one
[41:48.700 --> 41:52.180]  I'm going down the wrong way there. So I kind of eat like the
[41:52.180 --> 41:56.220]  cookie monster and break something like forget to swallow a
[41:56.220 --> 41:59.060]  piece of it and it's in my lungs or get starts getting in my
[41:59.060 --> 42:01.300]  lungs. Not not very fun. But what you really don't want to get
[42:01.300 --> 42:03.820]  your lungs is these viruses, ladies and gentlemen. And that is
[42:03.820 --> 42:07.180]  why if you're not getting sunlight, which almost nobody is
[42:07.180 --> 42:09.860]  in the winter, it's so important to supplement with things like
[42:09.860 --> 42:12.580]  vitamin mineral fusion and the vitamin D3 gummies. But I'm
[42:12.580 --> 42:15.540]  done plugging. I'm done harping. But you got to know it's
[42:15.540 --> 42:18.660]  your funding that allows people like Dr. Peter McCulloch to get

[42:27.300 --> 42:31.420]  I know you as an audience, but the regular listener knows
[42:31.420 --> 42:34.580]  almost all of this. But remember, we're not just some

[44:02.460 --> 44:07.620]  28 year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from
[44:07.620 --> 44:11.940]  nowhere. The very heights of politics not in America, but the
[44:11.940 --> 44:16.300]  world. We are engaging the globalist at point blank range
[44:16.460 --> 44:20.220]  in the information war. But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I
[44:20.220 --> 44:23.660]  persevered. But the listeners and viewers who support them for
[44:23.660 --> 44:27.540]  wars for the real reason we've had the success. We're having
[44:27.540 --> 44:31.020]  now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order
[44:31.140 --> 44:35.780]  you've ever had. We are now entering the final mile of the
[44:35.780 --> 44:39.660]  marathon. And that's why today, it's more important than ever

[45:03.780 --> 45:06.460]  that's because it's been denatured. It's been a lockdown. We
[45:06.460 --> 45:11.340]  didn't do that. Do you think I would metaphysically tell you
[45:11.340 --> 45:13.860]  something? This is the very best I can get. I'd rather go to

[45:50.580 --> 45:54.220]  number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good

[45:57.260 --> 46:01.780]  so are our products in four store.com. Until about 150 years
[46:01.780 --> 46:06.820]  ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick
[46:06.940 --> 46:10.060]  and died in many cases in the winter because of something
[46:10.060 --> 46:14.900]  called vapors. They associated these poisonous vapors with
[46:14.940 --> 46:18.220]  cold weather. Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or
[46:18.380 --> 46:21.500]  catching a chill that killed people. What was killing people
[46:21.500 --> 46:27.340]  was a lack of vitamin D three. You see the sun via your skin
[46:27.420 --> 46:31.260]  helps your body produce vitamin D three. But if you're not
[46:31.260 --> 46:34.620]  getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D three. And
[46:34.620 --> 46:37.020]  then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start
[46:37.020 --> 46:40.020]  replicating and taking your body over. So now it's more
[46:40.020 --> 46:42.580]  important than ever because the winter is here to take high
[46:42.580 --> 46:45.620]  quality vitamin D three. And we have the best with our vitamin

[47:18.740 --> 47:21.220]  Welcome back, my friends. I want to say something about nuclear
[47:21.220 --> 47:23.140]  war here. And then I'm going to finish up with the medical
[47:23.140 --> 47:25.820]  news and get back into that. Then get into the global economy
[47:25.820 --> 47:29.340]  being imploded by design with a real expert who's got the
[47:29.340 --> 47:33.940]  numbers and the facts been proven right. I am not a fearful
[47:33.940 --> 47:36.620]  person a lot person likes to be prepared likes to face things
[47:36.620 --> 47:42.060]  down. And earlier at the start of the next segment. I remember
[47:42.060 --> 47:45.180]  when I was about 16, the first time I had an anxiety attack, I
[47:45.180 --> 47:49.220]  probably only had 10 of them in my life. And you feel like you
[47:49.220 --> 47:51.500]  can't breathe and everything's crazy and you're sick,
[47:51.500 --> 47:53.940]  something's wrong. Remember the first time I had like four or
[47:53.940 --> 47:57.780]  five cups of coffee. When I was a teacher's aid when I was 17.
[47:58.780 --> 48:00.780]  In the you know, in the first period, I just drank too much
[48:00.780 --> 48:04.660]  coffee that day. I got up at like 4am jogged, lifted weights,
[48:04.660 --> 48:07.780]  ate breakfast, done some homework that was late, got to
[48:07.780 --> 48:10.740]  school at like, you know, eight in the morning, drank more coffee
[48:10.740 --> 48:13.020]  and I had an anxiety attack for too much coffee. My mom said,
[48:13.020 --> 48:15.420]  hey, how many cups of coffee you had? I said, I had five. She
[48:15.420 --> 48:18.820]  said, you can't do that. Next time I went to a cafeteria. It was
[48:18.820 --> 48:22.460]  all you could eat, drink about six glasses of iced tea and
[48:22.460 --> 48:25.380]  anxiety attack. So I learned not to get too much caffeine or I
[48:25.380 --> 48:28.100]  could have that. I never really had any since then. And now I
[48:28.100 --> 48:31.820]  only have about one cup of coffee a day or so. But lately,
[48:31.820 --> 48:35.660]  with this nuclear war stuff, I have been having anxiety attacks.
[48:36.060 --> 48:38.540]  And I started having one start a last segment when I looked at
[48:38.540 --> 48:41.100]  the news and was about to cover it. I just couldn't do it.
[48:41.620 --> 48:46.300]  Because I have children. And I'm pissed off. And there's a
[48:46.300 --> 48:49.980]  really good chance we're all gonna die. And I'm tired of this.
[48:49.980 --> 48:52.260]  And I'm sick of the New World Order and I'm sick of the
[48:52.260 --> 48:58.260]  criminals that run Washington. See, I'm sorry. And I tell you,
[48:59.100 --> 49:00.980]  it's because I'm not turning this desk over and I'm not
[49:00.980 --> 49:04.340]  smashing stuff. Because that's what I really feel like doing.
[49:05.300 --> 49:08.740]  But instead of doing that, we just take a deep breath and just
[49:08.740 --> 49:11.420]  pray to God to cause a global awakening, which is starting to
[49:11.420 --> 49:13.780]  happen, and that we just have peace. And I know things are
[49:13.780 --> 49:17.660]  gonna be perfect. And we know what revelation looks like. And
[49:17.660 --> 49:20.380]  they had a big pullout this week, I didn't get to it yesterday
[49:20.380 --> 49:22.820]  were upwards of half of Americans think we're in the
[49:22.820 --> 49:28.180]  end times. Well, Nineveh was about to be destroyed. But God
[49:28.180 --> 49:31.780]  sent Jonah and Nineveh was given 100 year reprieve because
[49:31.780 --> 49:42.500]  they repented. And so God has fordained. God has set things
[49:42.500 --> 49:45.460]  up that are gonna happen. But God also lets us choose our own
[49:45.460 --> 49:48.220]  adventure. You know, those little books for teenagers where
[49:48.220 --> 49:50.300]  they have three or four different endings, and you choose
[49:50.300 --> 49:54.180]  your adventure by what page you turn to. And so it's it's set
[49:54.180 --> 49:57.700]  what's going to happen, starting history. But it's also up to
[49:57.700 --> 50:02.140]  our will and what we do. God gives us options. And I can tell
[50:02.140 --> 50:04.380]  you at a gut level, a spiritual level, not just an
[50:04.380 --> 50:08.020]  intellectual level, not just a military level, but at a gut
[50:08.020 --> 50:11.300]  level, I can tell you this situation with Russia, and I'm
[50:11.300 --> 50:14.900]  thinking you need to me to tell you this is very dangerous. And
[50:14.900 --> 50:19.380]  it's ticking towards thermal nuclear armageddon and God said
[50:19.380 --> 50:22.300]  next time he destroy much of the earth not with water but with
[50:22.300 --> 50:35.260]  fire. And so that's where we are. And it's what you expect to
[50:35.260 --> 50:37.980]  happen when they have drag queen story time at the White
[50:37.980 --> 50:42.500]  House that that's a nice Sodom and Gomorrah signpost or like a
[50:42.500 --> 50:45.300]  light on the oven telling you that you know the turkey's done.
[50:46.020 --> 50:49.100]  And of course, the drag queen people that were at the White
[50:49.100 --> 50:52.220]  House are on record as an article on them for worse.com. I'm
[50:52.220 --> 50:54.620]  not going to quote it here on air talking about sex with
[50:54.620 --> 51:02.380]  children. Of course, that's what goes on at the White House. And
[51:02.380 --> 51:05.180]  you got mass smuggling going on by Biden. And now he's
[51:05.180 --> 51:07.940]  completely dissolved in the border, getting rid of title 42.
[51:07.940 --> 51:11.220]  We are a cursed nation. Let's just admit it. We turned away
[51:11.220 --> 51:13.020]  from God and look where we are now.
[51:17.940 --> 51:23.460]  So it's a bunch of maniacs that want our children. Now, I said
[51:23.460 --> 51:25.580]  I get to this first. So let's play these clips. One is the
[51:25.580 --> 51:32.100]  Santa's one is a leading British MP. And then another we need to
[51:32.100 --> 51:37.700]  get to is also very, very critical to break down. And
[51:37.700 --> 51:40.740]  that's Dr. Peter McCullough. So let's just play clip 15
[51:40.740 --> 51:45.060]  five and seven back to back here. They are a group based out of
[51:45.060 --> 51:50.060]  the UK, but represent 70 grassroots organizations all over
[51:50.060 --> 51:53.380]  the world. Dr. Mahotra is one of the leaders of this group. The
[51:53.380 --> 51:58.460]  World Council for Health on June 11 2022 issued a pharmacovigilance
[51:58.460 --> 52:04.340]  report. They analyzed all the vaccines, 39 safety systems, four
[52:04.340 --> 52:08.260]  big ones in the world. And they're all consistent. There is an
[52:08.260 --> 52:12.980]  alarming signal of excess death after taking the vaccine, an
[52:12.980 --> 52:16.540]  alarming signal. Looking backwards, these vaccines should
[52:16.540 --> 52:19.980]  have come off the market in early January of 2021 for excess
[52:19.980 --> 52:24.180]  mortality. People dying early after the vaccines now dying late
[52:24.540 --> 52:28.980]  after the vaccines. And this report is comprehensive. It's
[52:28.980 --> 52:32.700]  about 20 pages long. And I encourage anybody if they're
[52:32.700 --> 52:35.620]  saying, Listen, show me some evidence that the vaccines are
[52:35.620 --> 52:38.580]  harmful. You know, don't do it on your own. Just go to the World
[52:38.580 --> 52:41.500]  Council for Health. This is a wonderful synthesis, because it's
[52:41.500 --> 52:47.900]  all over the world. And I can tell you, in total, many tens of
[52:47.900 --> 52:50.940]  thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, and potentially
[52:50.940 --> 52:56.580]  millions of people have lost their lives with the vaccine. This
[52:56.580 --> 53:01.860]  will go down as the biggest biological pharmaceutical safety
[53:01.860 --> 53:06.980]  disaster in the history of mankind by a mile. This will go
[53:06.980 --> 53:11.140]  down worse than most wars in terms of mortality.
[53:11.940 --> 53:17.100]  You know, part of this issue and other issues with COVID goes
[53:17.100 --> 53:23.460]  back to an attempt to enforce one acceptable narrative on all
[53:23.460 --> 53:28.860]  these issues. And, you know, you saw it with the censorship of
[53:28.860 --> 53:34.260]  Dr. Botticharia with Twitter. You also saw it with Dr. Fauci and
[53:34.260 --> 53:38.140]  some of these people saying that they needed to go after these
[53:38.140 --> 53:41.100]  people who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration. They
[53:41.100 --> 53:45.900]  wanted to not contest the ideas in that. They basically wanted to
[53:45.900 --> 53:50.900]  to smear them because they didn't want to have any criticism of
[53:50.900 --> 53:54.540]  their lockdown policies. And so part of the reason I think it's
[53:54.540 --> 53:58.940]  been a bad response is because from the very beginning, you had
[53:58.940 --> 54:03.820]  a lot of arrogance that it's our way or the highway and anyone
[54:03.820 --> 54:06.740]  that offers any type of a dissenting opinion. And they
[54:06.740 --> 54:10.180]  were censoring from day one people that would write anti
[54:10.180 --> 54:14.900]  lockdown things in March of 2020, April 2020. Some of those
[54:14.900 --> 54:18.420]  would get taken down off some of these big tech platforms. And
[54:18.420 --> 54:22.820]  so we saw that over and over again. And I think that
[54:22.820 --> 54:27.500]  ultimately, you know, your policies or your positions or
[54:27.500 --> 54:30.300]  your analysis of this medical science should stand on its
[54:30.300 --> 54:33.980]  own. And if it if it's not able to accept criticism, if you
[54:33.980 --> 54:37.940]  can't defend the policy against against valid criticism, then
[54:37.940 --> 54:40.540]  maybe you need to be looking in the mirror. But that's not what
[54:40.540 --> 54:43.700]  these elites wanted to do. They wanted to just cocoon
[54:43.700 --> 54:46.940]  themselves from any criticism, and to try to denigrate
[54:46.940 --> 54:50.940]  anybody that had a different way of thinking. So I think with
[54:50.940 --> 54:53.860]  the Twitter, what Elon Musk is doing, I think there's going to
[54:53.860 --> 54:57.220]  be a lot more that comes out with that. And I think that
[54:57.220 --> 55:00.460]  that's very important. But I think it's also important to say,
[55:00.500 --> 55:05.220]  you know, Twitter is not even close to most of the censorship
[55:05.220 --> 55:08.580]  what was going on. They're much smaller company than like a
[55:08.580 --> 55:11.900]  Google or YouTube or some of these others. And I guarantee
[55:11.900 --> 55:15.220]  you, everything that was going on in Twitter is going on in
[55:15.220 --> 55:19.420]  these others, if not even more so. And we got a sense of that
[55:19.420 --> 55:24.060]  when they went after us for for having the opposing the masks,
[55:24.100 --> 55:27.460]  having the experts oppose the masks for these young kids.
[55:27.700 --> 55:30.540]  That's right, huge organized government corporate combines
[55:30.540 --> 55:33.540]  censoring, persecuting, attacking and calling for our
[55:33.540 --> 55:36.700]  arrest when we question things. Remember, I'm wanting to arrest
[55:36.700 --> 55:40.260]  anti vaxxers and all the rest of it. So Dr.
[55:41.820 --> 55:44.580]  McCulloch expose what's going on, Governor DeSantis expose what
[55:44.580 --> 55:47.620]  goes on. The member of parliament in the UK, Andrew
[55:47.620 --> 55:50.860]  Bridgen also has been talking about what whistleblowers are
[55:50.860 --> 55:53.220]  telling him. But we've known this for years and years, you heard
[55:53.220 --> 55:57.660]  the key that DeSantis laid out there. He said day one, they
[55:57.660 --> 56:00.860]  were suppressing everybody because they knew what they were
[56:00.860 --> 56:06.340]  doing. And that's why this is life and death. We're going to
[56:06.340 --> 56:09.060]  be in a permanent biomedical journey where they kill us with
[56:09.060 --> 56:12.660]  shots. And where it's normalized that people just die
[56:12.660 --> 56:15.380]  everywhere and we just get used to it. And then everybody just
[56:15.380 --> 56:17.740]  goes along with it because no one wants to admit it's happening.
[56:17.780 --> 56:20.740]  Mass Stockholm syndrome, that's their attempt and goal. Remember,
[56:20.740 --> 56:23.300]  I met with the top globalist once. I was on an airplane with
[56:23.300 --> 56:26.660]  him for three hours flying to New York. And I recognize you're
[56:26.660 --> 56:28.860]  the head of the major bank. Yeah, this is off record Alex, I'll
[56:28.860 --> 56:31.700]  tell you. And he just said they're going to adapt to being
[56:31.700 --> 56:34.140]  slaves. You don't get it. You think they're going to adapt and
[56:34.140 --> 56:37.940]  overcome like you do. No, you should join us because you you
[56:37.940 --> 56:40.780]  overcome. They don't overcome. They're going to submit to
[56:40.780 --> 56:45.060]  whatever we do. Well, no, we're not. No, we're not. And I'm not
[56:45.060 --> 56:49.300]  signing on the mass murder. As if anybody's going to be safe in
[56:49.300 --> 56:52.340]  this future system with you people. So we'll end the clip with
[56:52.340 --> 56:54.980]  a member of parliament and then start the second hour with our
[56:54.980 --> 56:57.540]  special guest that you believe me do not want to miss what's
[56:57.540 --> 57:02.820]  coming up in the next hour. Go ahead and play this clip. Madam
[57:02.820 --> 57:05.300]  Deputy Speaker, it's also been brought to my attention by a
[57:05.300 --> 57:08.900]  whistleblower from a very reliable source that one of these
[57:08.900 --> 57:12.660]  institutions covering up clear data that reveals the mRNA
[57:12.660 --> 57:17.220]  vaccine increases inflammation of the heart arteries. They are
[57:17.220 --> 57:20.500]  covering this up in fear that they may lose funding from the
[57:20.500 --> 57:25.060]  pharmaceutical industry. The lead of that cardiology research
[57:25.060 --> 57:29.220]  department has a prominent leadership role with the British
[57:29.220 --> 57:32.580]  Heart Foundation. And I'm very disappointed to say that that
[57:32.580 --> 57:36.740]  he has sent out non-disclosure agreements to his research team
[57:36.740 --> 57:40.820]  to ensure that this important data never sees the light of day.
[57:40.820 --> 57:45.700]  This, Madam Deputy Speaker, is is an absolute disgrace.
[57:50.260 --> 57:55.300]  Info Wars MD is finally here. It's the very same high quality
[57:55.300 --> 57:58.020]  products you've been getting through Info Wars Life, but an

[58:50.580 --> 58:54.820]  It's a post COVID world now. Americans have lost trust in their
[58:54.820 --> 58:58.180]  doctors and the healthcare system. There's a solution.
[58:58.180 --> 59:01.140]  The wellness company. I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the chief

[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:30.760]  is publicly green lit the cruise missile attacks inside Russia that have been
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.060]  going on for a week and a half. We can see a Russian tank, we can see a
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:38.060]  Russian APC, we can see a Russian missile get launched and that information
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:41.900]  gets fed to the Ukrainians and they could actually act on it almost
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.020]  immediately which is something I think the Russians never contemplated. Well if
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:49.500]  Putin didn't contemplate that his intelligence services didn't contemplate
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.300]  that they're idiots because I knew it and I told you that. Oh the spin is when
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:58.980]  the Russians fire a missile we give them a live time like when Ukraine fired those
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.860]  missiles into Poland to blame it on Putin and try to get a nuclear war going
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:12.740]  a month ago. This is a very dramatic potential escalation obviously because
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:19.460]  Poland is a NATO country. There were ongoing cruise missile attacks being
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:25.020]  carried out in the west of Ukraine close to Poland's border at the time that
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:31.180]  these projectiles landed on Polish territory. It is conceivable that they
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:35.780]  are Russian missiles. I'm not pro-Russia, I'm pro-non-nuclear war.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:45.700]  Shall we play a game? How about global thermal nuclear war? And Russia's got its
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:49.700]  problems and is committed its crimes but compared to the new world order they
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.260]  are amateurs ladies and gentlemen but they've got a giant nuclear weapons
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.740]  arsenal they're being pushed into a corner and now Putin's threatening nuclear
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:08.300]  war. Russia might as well be fighting Martians right now. The technology is
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:15.140]  30 40 years in advance. Can Russia deploy tens of thousands of one-man team
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:19.100]  launched one guy can put two switch blades on his back and those switch
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:24.700]  blades can go out and take out multiple Russian vehicles over the top dangerous
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:29.260]  the Pentagon is green lit you've been seeing for two weeks or 12 days almost
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:35.020]  two weeks daily cruise missile attacks into Russia blowing up military bases
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:39.180]  so Putin goes okay I may do a first strike with nukes I said I wouldn't but
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:43.420]  now I may I mean this is just huge and now we have strikes at at least three
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:48.140]  bases inside of Russia. Exactly and for him that is very worrying because now he
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:52.020]  knows that Ukraine could hit I mean we're talking about very close to Moscow
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:55.940]  right this is the center of the Kremlin and the center of Russian economy and
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:01.340]  power. Here we are ladies and gentlemen in the year 2022 and everything else quite
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:05.460]  frankly pells in significance now now why is war already started why is more
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:09.980]  war coming because they're at the end of a currency bubble they need a big global
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:14.860]  emergency to be able to basically make us forget that this is a giant Ponzi
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:20.660]  scheme that makes Bernie Madoff and FDX and the tulip mania that you know happened
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:25.500]  hundreds years ago pale in significance. Do you hate America? No. You know the fact
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:33.020]  another many mates I figure out we're sharing way more common that America is
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:39.180]  very much similar look it's the same size if they have a it's the same kind of
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:43.060]  this and when you talk to them there is nothing there even to be fabled we are
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:49.660]  naturally you know born not to be enemies and whenever this conflict it's
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:56.300]  elites you know every you know American I met in a prison who is there from rural
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:03.100]  area was very easy to deal with she has no problem with Russia and he was
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.940]  curious about Russia despite all propaganda they're losing their
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:11.440]  Christian values they're losing their families they're losing literally their
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.740]  countries you'll be laying your bed one night we'll be driving down the highway
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:20.820]  after work and there'll be big flashes you see and then ten seconds later your
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:25.300]  car is going to be overturned probably on fire and then life as you know it's
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:29.140]  over you won't get back to your family there'll be mass starvation and death
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:34.620]  and there'll be a new literal dark age with enough dust in the atmosphere to
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:40.460]  cause a mini ice age and they estimate seven billion people will die in a
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:45.180]  nuclear war there'll be maybe 500 million left which is what these death cult
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:48.740]  people fetish all day long
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:54.180]  alright folks Edward Dowd is about to cover the most important issues the

[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:12.260]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:17.460]  well the last few years Edward Dowd has made a lot of predictions that have come
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:23.980]  absolutely true unfortunately and he has become a very very well-known respected
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:29.620]  analyst who's already a big Wall Street analyst and stock picker he's an ex
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:34.940]  Wall Street professional worked at HSBC Donaldson Lufkin and other black rock
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:38.580]  he's worked all over Wall Street the sell side the buy side expert and fixed
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:42.500]  income and equities capital markets he's currently working with folks around the
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:46.060]  world and major whistleblowers that he said will be coming forward and are now
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:53.380]  statisticians top statisticians saying we're seeing between an 11 and 18% in the
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:57.340]  western world and countries that took the shots increase in mortality bigger
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:06.740]  than we even saw in World War two and just on Friday the big actuary government
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:12.340]  slash corporate consortium in Australia came out and said a 13% increase in
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:16.060]  death unprecedented in history the previous ones were three four percent
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:21.500]  those are seen as massive so there's no doubt this is going on the question is
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:25.180]  how bad is it and what's coming next because we don't yet know the long-term
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:30.020]  effects similar in RNA killed a lot of the mice up front but definitely cut the
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:33.620]  other live short usually about 50% depending on the studies we covered
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:40.180]  here that Fauci by the way conducted the University of Texas in 2012 to 2015 and
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:45.460]  continuing on so we have grand juries being in panel at the state level in
[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:50.220]  Florida to investigate this we have so much happening so to give us the latest
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:54.180]  numbers and data and what he testified in Senator Ron Johnson's hearings on is
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:58.740]  Edward Dowd and he's also going to get into the controlled worldwide recession
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:03.140]  depression that's being carried out in the great reset and what he believes is
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:07.620]  coming next now we can prepare for it so mr. Dowd thank you so much for joining
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:15.860]  us on Twitter at Dowd Ward or on getter at Edward Dowd and so he is joining us
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:20.540]  now thank you so much for coming on thanks for having me again on Alex
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:25.060]  appreciate the time Twitter still banned got banned in June still not
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:32.300]  reinstated so I'm not on Twitter just on getter at Edward Dowd yeah I testified
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:36.900]  last week for Ron Johnson and I just recently wrote a book called cause unknown
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:41.740]  the epidemic of sudden death in 21 and 22 it's now available in hard copy at
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:47.660]  Sky Horse Publishing and Amazon and basically the book is for the marginal
[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:52.700]  mind we stay away from the who and why we just establish it's true and it's
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:57.260]  happening just like you said it is happening it's it's devastating my
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:00.900]  thesis in the book is that it's the vaccines if anybody else has another
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:04.620]  explanation love to hear but what we do know is there's crickets from our health
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:09.540]  authorities not just in the US but globally as well but here's the bottom
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:13.140]  line let me let me tell you that what I told senator Ron John and let me just
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:17.500]  interrupt because I wanted to get you on I talked to Tony at Sky Horse and then
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.740]  the main reason you're honest about the book but I've been trying to get on for
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:23.460]  a few weeks and then I get off and all the other subjects to take some time the
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:29.540]  book is so critical tell people about cause unknown this is so important well
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:34.260]  I can wrap the book into current events as well so the bottom line is the book
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:38.660]  establishes my curiosity into the anecdotal evidence to start popping up
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:45.100]  for me personally in 20 March April of 21 I started seeing you know illnesses
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:49.220]  and deaths in my friend circle and then of course I was seeing early on the
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:53.940]  sudden athletic deaths all over the globe and the book basically establishes
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:58.580]  that the sudden athletic deaths the most elite fit amongst us does not happen
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:04.500]  at the rate that we're currently seeing okay the bottom line is before 2021 there
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:09.860]  was a study called the Lucene study that over 38 years determined there were 29
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:14.940]  sudden athletic deaths under 30 under the age of 30 globally we can't go
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:20.940]  without a month we'd be lucky to get a month with 29 just 29 we have months
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:26.500]  now with 90 100 110 120 we have thousands and thousands of these cases now
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.700]  we just had three reporters die and now they've confirmed one of them is a
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:37.260]  order blue and he was in shape so this is just at the World Cup absolutely this
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:41.820]  is and it seems to be accelerating at a pace that we can get into later on in
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:45.300]  our discussion about what I see going forward but the bottom line I
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:50.080]  established in the book is it true yes it's true is excess mortality on the
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:55.540]  rise across the globe yes what is the big change from 2020 mostly old people
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:11:00.540]  died of COVID pre-vaccine in 2021 and 22 there's been a mixed shift the
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.540]  younger folks I established that in the book I might be since it's the vaccine
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:10.980]  we have a foreword by Bobby Kennedy and afterward by Gavin de Becker who was the
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.860]  man who pitched me the book with Tony Lyons and he was also my editor and
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:21.420]  it's a great compendium of facts figures data Wall Street a way to look at this
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:25.740]  view of the Wall Street viewpoint which is mine and we also have news that you
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:30.420]  might not have seen so this is a primer for those that don't know what's going
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.100]  on it comes at it without getting the who and why so we don't know you know
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.700]  assault their worldview we just want them to know it's true that they have a
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:42.260]  better explanation love to hear but this and let's expand on that because a lot
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.900]  of people humans are designed when we get attacked to actually get over it and
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:49.740]  move on move forward that's one blind spot conservatives and hard workers have
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.980]  as we're like yeah we know we got it let's move on no this is the opening
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:58.780]  salvo and you bridge the two in the great reset in your analysis that that's
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:02.180]  why this is so important is this is just the beginning of their war against us
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:07.860]  so we better get dialed in right now correct and the you know because the
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:11.020]  global health authorities are not admitting to this third in my book I
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:16.500]  can this forget the who and why they see the data we see and that's a global
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:21.020]  cover-up and especially in the US no actions been taken at least Denmark who
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:25.060]  was devastated by the vaccine stopped their vaccination program under 50 while
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:30.060]  I was writing the book that's in my book and the bottom line is they saw excess
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:36.460]  deaths rise every year for over 2020 2021 was over 2020 2022 was over 21
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:40.140]  across all age groups they were one of the most vaccinated countries and they
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:45.900]  said quote it's better to get COVID than to take the vaccine under 50 which is
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:51.620]  a or well in double speak for the vaccine will kill you more than than
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:55.300]  COVID what so pull back and I want to give you the floor to walk through all
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.300]  this now ties in economics what's happening financially but obviously the
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:02.900]  deep state social engineer big pharma did this as a test to see what they can
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:06.460]  get away with I think they failed the test I think they're really scared right
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.500]  now as all these top people call for their prosecution and grand juries are
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.780]  opening up I mean if you looked at this as a sick sudden death you know football
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:19.140]  game where people actually die I think we've been losing the first half we're
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.460]  now going into the end of the third quarter and we're actually have the
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:27.860]  ball and have actually surpassed the enemy but but now this thing is very
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:34.660]  very close I agree when I was with Senator Johnson last week I told him
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.540]  personally that I think this is a national security issue because the
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:41.820]  bottom line is this the data that we've amassed and it's in the book it was
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:46.260]  detrimental to your health to be employed in 2021 and 2022 bottom line and
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:50.700]  the story the data suggests that two different data sets I can walk through
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:54.980]  that real quickly but the bottom line is the most able-bodied amongst us seem to
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:59.940]  be dying more and getting disabled more than the general population which has
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:04.500]  of course those who weren't vaccinated so this general population is usually a
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:09.580]  much less healthier than the employed population of the country and just two
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:14.740]  numbers two two different data sets the the act the side of actuaries demo with
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:19.180]  the report in August not my numbers that they verified our numbers that we had in
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:24.820]  March but they said 40% excess mortality in their specific subset of the
[01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:30.100]  population group-like policy holders from ages 25 to 64 they're generally
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:34.740]  speaking a more healthy population than the general population and they the
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:38.860]  society has done studies to prove that they died a rate of about a third that
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:44.980]  of the general population in a given year in 2021 that flip they their excess
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:50.100]  that as I said was 40% and the general population was 32 so boom that's smoking
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:54.980]  gun number one you go to a different data set US Bureau of Labor statistics
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:58.820]  which is monthly survey does the employment report disability was
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:02.980]  running around 29 to 30 million for the prior four or five years it shot up
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:08.540]  beginning around February May timeframe of 21 to about 33.2 million as of
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:12.740]  September it's coming off a little bit with an October November data but when
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:16.700]  we when we delve into the data what do we find we find that the employed
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:22.460]  population their rate of disability increased 26% as of September and the
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:28.220]  general overall population increased 11% again that shouldn't be happening we
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:32.300]  also saw the rate of change year-over-year rate of change was in Wall Street
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:37.100]  speak a three standard deviation event which in my world doesn't happen all that
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:42.180]  often happens point zero three percent of the time so something happened and it
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:45.540]  was you know obviously in my humble opinion the vaccines I'm a hundred
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.860]  percent sure that I'm convicted every doubt stay there let's come back and
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:52.460]  talk about what this means the civilization and so much more for

[01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:04.940]  sat on him was death and hell followed with him a book of revelation very
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:08.500]  serious times to be alive folks they're not just doing this is one off this is
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:11.820]  the beginning of the rest of our lives this is our fight and I'm proud of
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:15.700]  humanity the globalists even admit it's leaked they're very upset that they're
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:19.140]  losing and and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would they are they
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:21.900]  are licking their wounds they're gonna come back the Empire's gonna strike back
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:25.020]  Edward Dowd you were getting into the actuaries the government numbers the
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:29.780]  facts that are undisputed now years after you first was warning of it that
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:34.900]  indeed this is directly correlated to these shots and they know it and they're
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:41.900]  covering it up please continue so the bottom line it's true it's happening what
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.180]  we need to know is this it's crickets in the mainstream media it's cricket from
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:48.540]  the global health authorities and the global governments so it's it's the
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:52.540]  biggest cover-up in crime that I've ever seen and the mission now for
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:57.740]  everybody out there that's you know you know in the choir already is to convince
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:02.100]  the marginal mind of what's going on and you know this is what I call the
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:08.580]  greatest in a symptomatic asymmetric asymmetric information gap of my
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:14.100]  lifetime in my financial career and so about 10 20% of us know what's going on
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:19.540]  the other 80 90% down and we tip and win when everybody first realizes that this
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:24.740]  has happened and that's true we can figure out who did what later so a lot
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:27.780]  people can't accept that something this evil might have happened but just
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:30.620]  convince them it's happened and they can bite on to the fact that there's a
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:34.700]  cover-up and that you know former former companies aren't there to help you
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.820]  that you know they've been accused of crimes in the past so the clearing call
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:42.140]  is to convince the marginal mind everyone has to get off the the bench and
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:45.140]  out on the field well they've not just been accused I mean people like Bayer
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:49.660]  knowingly gave millions of people HIV and hepatitis at factor 8 knew it was
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:54.020]  happening and just didn't care and they and other companies do that Vioxx killed
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.660]  millions around the world and they just didn't care I mean in fact they like it
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:06.620]  sorry go ahead but Pfizer was found guilty of I think sales tactics that went
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:11.260]  against the law and they had to pay like a 2.2 billion dollar fine in the early
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:17.700]  2000s I forget the drug but you know former is not your friend their their
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:23.940]  job is to sell new patented drugs and not push forward over-the-counter drugs
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:28.620]  or you know repurpose drugs and that's that's what they do they're there for
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:32.220]  the bottom line they're not there for your health they treat symptoms they
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:36.300]  don't treat the cause the root cause they don't want to cure anything
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:40.420]  Goldman Sachs wrote a research for paper research report about this several
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:44.700]  years ago saying that curing the disease is not a good business model because
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:48.900]  the you know once you cure the patients cash flow stop so it's about treating
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:53.900]  symptoms not root causes we know this and they're not your friend and for some
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:59.300]  reason to the propaganda pick campaigns done on us by pharma the media
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.300]  companies and the government was it was involved it looks like there was a
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:06.620]  military-grade sign off to get people to take these jobs you got to break the
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:11.340]  spell and the spell is this it's happening it's true and it's going on and
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:16.060]  this is them you know what I'm offering in my book and at our finance
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:20.340]  technologies website the humanity project it's PHI Nance technologies
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:24.500]  dot com humanity project we have all the data we have every country there we're
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:28.340]  often even missing information the information that your global governments
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:32.980]  aren't presenting to you and if they were normal and they weren't corrupt this
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:37.420]  would have ended probably in January February of 2021 when Dr. McCullum the
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:41.940]  other doctors saw the bear signals fire off we you know the swine flu and in
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:48.020]  the in 76 stopped after 25 deaths that the swine flu vaccine fiasco 25 deaths
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:54.380]  here we have reported in bears I think north 15,000 now this is a disaster and
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:58.700]  the end of reporting factor in bears is you know some people calculated as 40 so
[01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:02.740]  you do the math on that and it's a disaster and it's happening globally so
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:08.900]  I'm at the point where I know the fight we're in I know what my job is my job is
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:12.940]  to continue to get the message out knowing that you know this is a grind and
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:17.260]  it's it's gonna it's gonna be a slow grind it happens faster if everybody gets
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:21.820]  involved can't just be those of us like you Alex and others talking everybody
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.980]  has to grab someone and show them what's going on and my book is a good
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:28.780]  Christmas present to do that because it's just the facts ma'am it
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:33.220]  establishes that it's true I don't assault people's world views you know I
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:36.460]  have a theory of the case of why this went down but it's not in the book we
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:40.900]  made a decision to kill that in the book because we wanted to reach as many
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:48.380]  might as talk about your well-researched mode over kimono of who and why they did this yeah
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:54.140]  I mean this is again my speculation but my speculation makes a lot of sense to a
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:59.460]  lot of people I did a speech at the AFA American Freedom Alliance conference
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:03.940]  October 1st and there's a video on rumble that has been flying around Wall
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.380]  Street and a lot of a lot of people on Wall Street have reached out to me
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:12.400]  quietly and say that they agree with me so the theory of the case is this we have
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:17.020]  a global sovereign debt problem after the great financial crisis all the
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:21.740]  fraud from the banks went on the balance sheets of the central banks and the
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.900]  global government spent like drunken sailors so we've kind of been in a zombie
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:29.580]  economy globally for 12 years where asset prices rose due to money printing and
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:34.300]  whatnot and you know those who were the closest to the printing press like CEOs
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:40.900]  and CFOs who get stock options hedge fund managers real estate developers and
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:46.260]  obviously government government politicians did quite well and everybody's
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:50.140]  kind of them left behind and the problem now is it's a it's a debt-based
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:54.700]  dollar system and that means that you need constant credit creation and
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:27:00.660]  eventually the global US dollar debt scenario has reached every you know the
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:04.420]  four corners of the earth and it needs constant growth well it stopped growing
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:09.940]  in 2019 we're about to go into a global economic recession and then mysteriously
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.460]  COVID comes along again we can get into whether there was planned or used as an
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:18.220]  excuse doesn't really matter but the bottom line is this COVID gave the Fed
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:23.060]  the central bankers cover to print unprecedented amounts of money the Fed
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:29.740]  printed 65% money the greatest money printing fiasco ever seen and that's
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:34.140]  only kept the system afloat for two years now we're collapsing again and we
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.820]  can talk about that we can talk about the vaccines and how they're going to
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:41.260]  play into the economic situation for years to come but the project the
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:48.700]  bottom line is I woke up when I saw Federal Reserve President James
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.540]  Bullard speak on face the nation you know a couple weeks after the lockdowns
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:58.140]  I think was April 3rd of 2020 and he talked about reopening the economy but
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:02.940]  with surveillance technologies and immunity badges and testing which was a
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:06.700]  precursor to the you know vaccine passport and the vaccines and I said to
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:10.020]  myself why is the central bank you're even talking about this and then it done
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:14.180]  on me that if you're gonna have a global sovereign debt collapse wouldn't be nice
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:20.220]  to have a control system to herd the population through fear prevent protests
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:25.620]  to use them as excuses to you know clamp down on the population and all you need
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:30.380]  to look look to is China China is imploding economically they reached a
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:35.700]  demographic wall in 2020 my partner color Carlos Allegria and finance
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:39.740]  technologies wrote a book on this economics demographics and global debt
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:44.700]  and they hit a wall in 2020 and now they're on a population decline and that
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:48.460]  affects their economy their growth rates going forward and we're gonna stay there
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:52.220]  this is the key to everything why are the globalists doing this it's all right

[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:24.540]  30 years ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning all of this and I
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:27.860]  warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:31.300]  your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population of
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:35.060]  the planet not just America we're public enemy number one when it comes to
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:38.540]  global agenda that's why it's more important than ever to realize how
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:42.540]  successful info wars has been because of your past support so I salute you and I
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:46.140]  thank you and I ask you now the critical juncture of the battle three double your
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:50.100]  efforts of visiting infowarstore.com getting amazing products that keep us
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:55.940]  on air 1776 the promo code the destination is infowarstore.com and I
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:32:00.860]  thank you all for your support so when I first started taking survival skill
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:05.020]  basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:09.260]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:12.540]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:16.500]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.340]  with that stew you have you know with a deep burn source you know and I got
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:23.300]  really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:28.580]  fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:32.780]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:36.380]  years I got my health back and I religiously took basically all of your
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:39.740]  supplements there they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like
[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:43.300]  recently is knockout it'll literally like if you want to sleep just take it
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:47.180]  it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:50.980]  that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:55.260]  take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother I thank you so
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:33:02.820]  much for calling Godspeed leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:07.380]  World Order it's Alex Jones
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:20.100]  defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:24.580]  and we're down now we have a huge audience of millions of people I love you
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:29.180]  all and I know that in the old days I covered a lot of serious topics but all
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:33.660]  said fun and played clips of leftist acting like idiots and crime scene
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:35.940]  stuff and things that I thought was interesting too because I wanted to have
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:43.060]  fun on the show we don't do really any of that here and you know maybe I'm wrong
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:47.420]  but but I just can't help but hammer let's stop nuclear war let's stop the
[01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:51.860]  border implosion let's stop the poison shots let's understand we got a really
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:56.860]  criminal predatory global bureaucracy that is going to the military industrial
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:00.900]  complex and saying fix our problems we got all these old people how do we
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:04.340]  euthanize them how do we set up death panels how do we normalize this in the
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:08.860]  public we just can't afford it and that's really what they're doing and it's
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:11.700]  of course they're not cutting any of their carbon footprint they're not
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:17.700]  gonna live on carbon rations they're not gonna eat bugs you are so this is what
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:21.860]  the authoritarian threat of all threats and you got cut off getting into your
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:26.020]  colleagues book on China and why they're in so much trouble and why they're on
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:29.620]  board with this whole globalist operation so ever down please continue
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:36.060]  and where you left off yeah sure no problem the bottom line is China is
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.980]  demographically imploding which is going to drive their economy through
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:44.380]  long-term growth rates at 2 to 3% GDP they've been growing you know you know
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:50.060]  12 10 7 8% for the last 30 years and that is basically what's kept them afloat
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:55.460]  they're now in an economic nosedive their debt is coming due they have
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:00.060]  real estate debt problems cities go cities infrastructure that leads to
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:04.100]  nowhere and that's coming home to roost and they can't employ their people and
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:07.700]  that's what we're seeing with these riots that started becoming public
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:11.980]  recently the riots been going on for a while and there's zero COVID policy is
[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:16.180]  cover it's covered to prevent those riots yes that some of the some of the
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:21.180]  protests are against the lockdowns but when you get enough people that are
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:24.100]  unemployed and can't feed their families they all start to talk to each other
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:27.580]  and they come into the street so that's really what's going on in China and it's
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:32.620]  very dangerous for the rest of the globe it is geopolitical implications when
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:37.340]  you're a power like China and I learned early on in the early 2000s when our
[01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:40.900]  energy guys were going to visit China because energy was a big part of China's
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:44.580]  growth they came back and they said one of the things that the Chinese
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:48.380]  authorities fear the most is their own people and their number one goal was to
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:54.020]  keep jobs growing so they could keep their people from you know protests
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:58.620]  against the you know the authoritarian ways if you keep them fed and happy you
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:02.140]  can keep staying hard right now they're worried about staying in power so they're
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:06.460]  going to have to create a global boogeyman and create the other enemy
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:10.300]  outside their own borders so the finger can't be pointed at them and if you
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:15.380]  don't think the DOD knows this and they have the same analysis that I have you
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:19.540]  know I'm you're naive because you know I've had someone from a three letter
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:24.700]  agency post me after I talked on banning about global the zero COVID policy
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:28.700]  where it was really about and they were curious where I got my information and I
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:33.460]  said no it's just analysis this is analysis of history and how the world
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:38.460]  works you've done this your whole you know career Alex you and I and others we
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:41.420]  can put together the dots come up with a theory of the case that's pretty close
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:45.340]  to the truth so when I'm telling you about COVID lockdowns I think it's dead
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:51.020]  spot on it's a system of control to prevent internal populations from
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:55.300]  rioting period in the story and to train them to have less resources and to
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:58.420]  think even being let out of their houses and to freedom so it's a lowering of
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:03.820]  expectations in civilization it's it's basically a lowering of standard of
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:08.780]  living and a cover for depopulation of the old people and others so if you
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:11.620]  agree with me and I agree with you that their plans not going too well
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:15.780]  China just suddenly turned off their lockdowns because it blows their face
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:21.420]  it went the opposite direction how is this global combine different
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:25.140]  organizations different groups but all testing the same sciences of control
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:32.300]  what are they going to do next then well I guess I just found out this weekend
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:39.300]  that there was a tabletop exercise called global contagion where at this
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:43.340]  time the virus affects and kills children was run by the same folks
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:49.380]  that brought you event 201 so maybe they release or you know mysteriously
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:54.380]  coincidentally some other deadly virus that we now have to be in fear about
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:38:01.020]  again I suspect regional wars tactical nukes will probably go off at some point
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:06.820]  I don't think they're gonna launch the ICBMs but I expect war in the next 12 to
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:11.820]  24 months I mean you have to cover up what's going on like you said it's being
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:15.740]  exposed my book is basically just showing what just happened globally we
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:21.140]  poisoned about five billion people I'm not saying that everyone is gonna die I
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:24.380]  think there's a lot of ways to reverse these processes and human body is an
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:28.900]  amazing thing but once people discover that they've been poisoned by their own
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:33.620]  governments either you know on purpose or inadvertently and propagandizing to
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:38.460]  taking these shots I think there's gonna be a lot of what I call chaotic
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:42.580]  disruption in all our institutions and it has to happen it's gonna happen it
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:48.380]  doesn't happen peacefully or does it happen violently I don't want people to
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:52.660]  go into the violent mode we're gonna do this the old-fashioned way walking and
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:55.620]  tackling through the legal system and that's why the intervention war is
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:59.660]  critical everybody's got to become an activist speak at the school board speak
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:03.340]  at the university board speak at the county board speak at everything call
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:06.860]  into c-span you may think that's just a little thing but there's billions of us
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:10.380]  if we all do a little it will just absolutely stop them and I think that's
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:13.380]  really the good news at the end of the day is they admitted that they were gonna
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:19.100]  try to have a controlled collapse so the big collapse that's coming they can pose
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:22.780]  as the saviors but instead they're now getting the blame the globalists are in
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:26.340]  trouble and so now they're not in a position to really carry out the next
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:30.140]  phase of this but even Bill Gates said two years ago they said well what comes
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:34.700]  next he said well I believe this is just a test said on NBC News he said I believe
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:39.100]  terrorists are gonna release a new weapon and when he talks about
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:44.420]  terrorists he's talking about himself and them and so yeah they love to brag
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:48.900]  very esoterically but you can I've learned how they operate over the years
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:52.180]  that when they say something you can bet they're planning it they usually carry
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:56.180]  it out but the more we can get in their face and start prosecuting them I think
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:02.500]  that will back them down from the next event I agree I think I think they're
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:07.580]  losing badly the narratives collapsing you know Governor DeSantis has got the
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:10.740]  state's Attorney General looking into this and that's how we defeated big
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:15.420]  tobacco with their lies there are a lot of individual suits and cases they all
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:21.900]  get dismissed because they couldn't prove a causation of smoking and the
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:27.180]  death but what the states AG AG's did is once they got on board they started to
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:32.500]  get discovery and I think what we need is discovery we need to shine light on
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:37.940]  what's been going on and I like to see other states join Governor DeSantis in
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:41.780]  probing what's going on at Pfizer and you said something earlier on your show I
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:47.340]  was listening before I came on that if you if we break and expose this vaccine
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:52.300]  issue it pierces the veil for a whole host of other things so that's why I'm
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:57.980]  solely focused on bringing this to a halt in an end and once the general
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:01.860]  population wakes up to what just happened to them that opens their mind and
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:06.060]  then they start to question many many things and that's right the big domino
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:09.820]  is this we there's other stuff you want to stop nuclear war may not be able to
[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:12.820]  like you said at least tactical because the globalists want it but something
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:16.460]  like this the public's understanding it we can push this domino over and then
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:22.140]  we'll mock the others down exactly I call this their bridge too far I don't
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:25.580]  think they understood that you know there's a lot of people in the system
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:28.900]  who are unwittingly serving the system they don't know what they're doing and
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:33.140]  they were forced to take these jabs or even you know ran to go get them and
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:38.620]  once they realize they've been betrayed the trust in all institutions is going
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:44.660]  to evaporate it's going to be chaotic it's going to be lots of chaos financial
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:48.500]  chaos but you know if you keep your head and wits about you stay healthy you
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:53.100]  know focus on your son on your spirituality and your mindset we're
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:55.420]  going to get to the other side that's going to be a renaissance we're going
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:59.380]  to build a new world now I don't know how long you know the chaos period lasts
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:03.860]  but the quicker the average marginal line wakes up the quicker the chaos ends
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:08.740]  absolutely ever doubt I'm very impressed with you and the silver lining and
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:12.140]  this whole evil as I get to meet all the great people like you and Peter
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:16.340]  McCullough and countless others we're gonna find out who's who currently and
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:19.780]  in the near future and I agree with you a new renaissance is ahead if we can
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:23.620]  just defeat these nihilistic the population as globalists who don't
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:27.340]  believe in humanity and we're down the new book from Skyhors Publishing cause

[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:06.100]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist I have come from
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:11.660]  nowhere to the very heights of politics not just in America but in the world we
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:16.060]  are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:21.060]  but I don't deserve the credit yes I've persevered but the listeners and viewers
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:26.060]  who support info wars for the real reason we've had the success we're having
[01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:31.060]  now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had we
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:37.420]  are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more
[01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:40.580]  important than ever realize how important you've been in this fight and
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:44.580]  to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify that I
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:49.980]  bless you all I salute you I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:54.860]  doing now because we are over the target and this is happening the fight is my
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:59.820]  fight it's your fight it's our fight God bless you all in Arizona I think we
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:06.100]  watched the election be stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:11.740]  ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:17.540]  when we we just it's election month Alex it's not election day and that's the
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:23.340]  problem and everything changed after COVID-19 they illegally changed state
[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:29.260]  elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:32.980]  ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we are in a
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:37.140]  serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and I
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:41.300]  believe that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020 and I have
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:45.860]  no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:50.940]  to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the the
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:55.580]  fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:46:02.140]  deniers we're election realists it's a post COVID world now Americans have lost

[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:21.100]  world order it's alex jones no stranger to the rain
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:31.620]  I'm a friend of thunder friend is it any wonder I thought with the devil
[01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:39.660]  I thought with the devil got down on his level but I never gave in so he gave
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:49.540]  it on stranger to the rain folks I'm not trying to scare you I'm just trying to
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:55.260]  get you ready and I'm right here with you I'm not ready yet either and through
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:58.980]  all my anger at the new world order it doesn't even show up on a breaker scale
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:04.100]  that I'm here because I love my family and if my family's gonna live in a good
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:07.020]  world that means your family's got to live in a good world and I love your
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:11.540]  family as well I'm a lot of empathy for everybody and we're gonna make it through
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:16.180]  this but if you study history time and time again really evil corrupt groups
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:21.140]  from time to time get control and they just want to kill people and start
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:25.380]  people and mind control people and do bad things and the good people out there
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:29.260]  who actually have a conscience of care brings tears by us think about my
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:36.940]  family we got a job to do and we're gonna do it and I know how powerful
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:42.220]  humanity is we're built by God we're made by God and God's image and I know we
[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:47.500]  can do this we don't have a choice and the only question is how bad's it gonna
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:51.340]  get till we cry out to God how bad's it gonna get till we finally realize the
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:55.220]  devil's real how bad's it gonna get until we realize this is spiritual
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:49:00.940]  battle now we into the show yesterday we had seven eight callers still on hold
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:05.660]  and I don't like leaving folks on hold so a lot of them gave us their names and
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:09.340]  numbers we're gonna call them right now and get them on the phone system but
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:12.300]  don't start calling yet because we got to have the phone system open to call
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:17.540]  these folks back and then as soon as we get those callers back online I'll give
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:21.300]  the general number out for everybody else in the third hour into the fourth
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:30.180]  hour today so let's talk about the real issues here Ron Paul says the mother of
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:34.300]  all economic crises will lead to social unrest and violence yes that's true Ron
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:42.220]  Paul and the WEF admits that and admits they've been engineering that how do you
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:46.220]  defeat that you stop their policies but the policies they get through we blame
[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:50.500]  on them because it's they did it they cut the pipelines off they shut down the
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:56.180]  economy they open the borders this is a blame game folks because if we don't
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:50:00.020]  blame the people that did this they're gonna pose as a saviors and I know you
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:06.580]  know that but you better go tell your city see the audience calls in and
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:10.500]  thanks me and the reason I say stop that is we're all in a lifeboat together
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:14.460]  and we've got a leak and we can fix the leak together we don't need to thank
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:18.540]  each other for it let's just fix it we're surviving here we're trying to
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:27.900]  prevail here and it is not correct to thank me for what I'm doing I just want
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:32.220]  you to help me and I want you to realize how important you are and how
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:36.260]  there's millions of you listening right now and if you just take action in
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:39.940]  little ways we'll fix all this it won't be perfect I'm not offering you
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:44.100]  utopia but it will certainly be the opposite of what we got people trying to
[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:48.540]  collapse civilization on purpose we have to recognize them we have to expose
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:53.140]  them we have to stop them and we have to prosecute them not of some vengeful
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:51:06.060]  thing but because they need the fear of God put in to them people ask me how
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:09.540]  do you go through the attacks how do you go through the demonization and not be
[01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:16.260]  fearful well it's because I am fearful because I know God's watching and I
[01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:19.900]  don't want my family destroyed and I don't want you destroyed and I am
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:23.500]  naturally concerned about the globalist are doing and I realize only
[01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:28.140]  countering them only fighting them gives us any chance this is not some
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:35.460]  heroic action here like oh Alex Jones is battling them that's special no you'd
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:43.740]  have to be a crazy person to go along with this I'm coming up for air folks
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:49.020]  I'm doing the default position of what you're supposed to do what Alex Jones
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:55.780]  does is not some wondrous magic pat him on the back thing if you're wake up at
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:59.900]  night your house is on fire you get your kids out it's not heroic to get your
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:11.580]  kids out and our house is on fire we're in a lot of trouble and until we wake up
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:15.460]  to that fact we don't have a hope but it's a minute we wake up we have more
[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:24.500]  than hope we have guaranteed victory still but as things progress what's the
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:27.820]  Churchill I butcher and I paraphrase it it's in one of those books ever in five
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:31.420]  or six was books I forget which one but he said there's most people in their
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:36.540]  life are run over by history and by big events and most people get run over by
[01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:39.220]  didn't get up and dust themselves off and forget that it happened and just
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:43.660]  decide to ignore what's going on but a minority of people what you call great
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:47.740]  men and great leaders and great women are people that get hit by that
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:52.180]  adversity and hit by that tyranny and run over by that thing in history and
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:57.980]  they decide to actually do something about it and it's those people that
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:02.940]  history and all the good things we've got rest on well we got to put money back
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:06.660]  in the bank for our children a lot of folks put a lot of stuff in the bank for
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:12.420]  us and with a lot of sacrifices for us and now we're gonna have to do it again
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:17.700]  right now and here's the great part about this equation as the tyranny grew
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:21.180]  and the corruption grew but it was still so much Liberty and the gas tank you
[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:25.500]  know 30 40 50 years ago you could say it was heroic to battle tyranny back then
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:27.940]  because you were gonna get persecuted you were gonna attack because it was
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:31.580]  taken over them now it's been in charge a while it's already eaten through almost
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:37.980]  everything it's already ruined everything and so now battling tyranny is
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:43.900]  self-preservation battling tyranny is the only option you've got other than I
[01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:48.500]  guess some people I've learned from the show they don't decide to fight the New
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:53.620]  World Order they don't decide to fight tyranny they don't decide to do
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:54:02.580]  anything for the good guys they decide to join with evil because well if it's
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:06.820]  taken over and it's that bad and I can get ahead of my work for it they go and
[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:12.220]  they join with it in the final phases well if you don't care about losing your
[01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:18.780]  soul then yeah have you joined evil 30 40 years ago for power you got a lot of
[01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:23.900]  power and money and control out of it but you still lose your soul you still
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:27.900]  sided with evil you still resonate with that force that becomes what you are but
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:35.140]  now at the end no one should be going along with this it's a bad bet it's a
[01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:40.500]  scam it's a fraud so we're gonna start the next hour we're gonna give the phone
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:43.980]  number out we're gonna take your calls I got a ton of news and clips and just so
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:49.820]  much I'm gonna get to but I'm gonna get to your calls I get to a lot of them but
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:55.980]  I just want to remind listeners it's a no-brainer to support info wars we need
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:59.940]  funds we're right in the edge of the red and the black where God just keeps me
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:04.300]  right on empty as I guess to motivate me but I'd rather not just sit up here and
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:07.460]  plug products all day but these really are great products you already need so I
[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:12.500]  see how God's working so we have this new info wars MD line where we just found
[01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:16.340]  out who our other suppliers of great supplements were so we cut through the
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:19.780]  middleman and now have two big national distributors the first big national
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:23.940]  distributor owned by listeners was already supplying us with most of our
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:28.220]  supplements we just cut the middleman is now putting out in their own factory the
[01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:32.820]  info wars MD label with clone products they already have that are best sellers
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:37.180]  nationwide so these are already top products many of number one best

[01:59:50.980 --> 02:00:00.180]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance when you have
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:05.940]  us senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first
[02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:09.540]  and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before what do you think that
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:16.340]  makes the Russians do well it makes them go into war mode so I don't like them
[02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:20.300]  invading Ukraine I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum
[02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:24.140]  alert only one level above that on their death con just like our system and
[02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:30.900]  that's fire the weapons and so now we have Democrats all over the news let's
[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:36.420]  just use nuclear weapons on Russia think of their interests Russia has hundreds
[02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:40.980]  of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize
[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:45.980]  our cities within five minutes on average of being launched sea-launched cruise
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:51.420]  missiles that fly at Mach 5 land launch system they can also launch from ships
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:56.660]  that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down and yes the United States has those
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:01:01.980]  two that's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed system that we don't have it's
[02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:06.580]  on record the US has those systems the point is it's called mutually assured
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:11.660]  destruction or mad for a reason because anyone that would violate the mad
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:16.460]  doctrine is insane and you know I'm on the side of not having nuclear war
[02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:19.940]  especially when Russia is not starting a fight with us and especially after we
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:23.860]  just heard for years that everything happening in this country's run by Russia
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:29.140]  when that was all a giant lie the globalists are the outside evil force
[02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:50.660]  it's called the great reset tough guy it's called the New World Order it's
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:54.780]  called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they
[02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:59.020]  can loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:03.260]  and the universal basic income that's everything that's the whole future of
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:07.460]  our lives the whole world's gonna be about surveillance and control and then
[02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:10.900]  manipulating and tracking everything you do it's all being officially announced
[02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:18.940]  we had articles everywhere their press releases saying and the crew asked me
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:22.980]  in the break they go are you all right really seem upset you are you feeling
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:27.380]  okay I mean they're gonna starve a couple hundred million people that's
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:32.340]  young I'm pretty freaked out yeah this is real this is not this is not a
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:35.860]  freaking game to me man
[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:54.940]  they're dying right now and no one's coming because God tells us to get up
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:03:09.780]  and take action and then we don't do anything once again for the first time
[02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:14.540]  what has seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out true yeah I'm upset
[02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:24.260]  I'm really freaked out I'm really freaked out I'm really freaked out you see
[02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:28.700]  because this is real the supply chain being cut off the energy grid being
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:35.620]  cut off it's real and we're going into a time now we're not gonna be on the

[02:06:57.740 --> 02:07:03.180]  Darrell and David and Aaron and Mason and here to read and Gary and Evan and
[02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:09.180]  Rob and bone crusher and one card money calls from Hawaii to New Jersey from

[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:22.140]  coming up right now and I want to go to a caller in New York first because the
[02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:25.820]  globalists of the day what they're about to do they go soon the power will go out
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:30.580]  terrorists are going to hit it and that sounds more like Schwarzenegger than
[02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:35.100]  Claus Schwab but the point we penetrate the governments so your power will soon
[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:40.700]  be out and we will take over and don't get used to having power anymore cyber
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:47.340]  outages will make COVID look like a happy time these are basically quotes and so
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:51.460]  gather losing but they're in control of the infrastructure and they've got the
[02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:55.540]  general public domesticated including me I mean I know how to skin a buck run a
[02:07:55.540 --> 02:08:01.500]  trot line I know how to grow a garden and I'm like way more woodsy than like 90
[02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:06.860]  percent of people but if you compared me to say my grandmother or my grandfather
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:14.340]  my dad's parents or their parents I'm an idiot so a country boy can survive cuz
[02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:17.980]  you can't starve us out and you can't make us run because these old boys are
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:24.060]  raised on shotguns we say grace we say man and it ain't into that we don't give
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:27.940]  a damn but let's come in the next segment with that I got two versions of
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:31.460]  there I want to cut right to the best part of the song there's don't know I want
[02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:34.260]  to play the song I'm gonna start play from right to do that little part of the
[02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:38.740]  stanza there I think that's what they call it so yeah we need to be having
[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:42.860]  our head on a swivel right now and getting as prepared as we can so Tyler
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:47.580]  in New York you want to talk about that welcome go ahead hi Alex thanks for
[02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:52.100]  taking my call I read an article a couple days ago I can't remember who
[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:56.820]  was from but I remember reading that from January to August of this year that
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:09:01.540]  we had what they thought was an intentional over a hundred attacks on
[02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:06.260]  our electrical grids and substations and then I know that we had that big one in
[02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:11.620]  North Carolina and in Washington and all over the place yeah Pacific Northwest
[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:16.580]  and that one in Washington I know they kind of just wanted to blame on Trump
[02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:20.980]  supporter terrorists and how many times have I said they're gonna blow
[02:09:20.980 --> 02:09:24.300]  the power grid up and say Trump supporters did it exactly and so I
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:27.700]  wondered because it is kind of thing to get memory hole and I don't really see
[02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:31.020]  anyone talking about it and I know there's a lot of stuff going on but well
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:35.900]  it was globalist cut off the most the pipelines the country and yeah they're
[02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:39.620]  gonna they're gonna cut off a few pipelines and say we did it to blame the
[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:43.900]  total collapse they've already cost you understand all the thousand pipelines we
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:48.580]  shut down or plus didn't do it it was this one got blown up by some Trump
[02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:53.300]  supporter yeah right yeah so I just I just kind of noticed that no one's really
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:56.660]  been talking about it and it seems like a big deal I just want to class what
[02:09:56.660 --> 02:10:01.180]  class swabs talking about it he's priming everybody for it didn't he yeah
[02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:07.260]  so I just I just wanted maybe you were looking into it or they are salivating
[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:11.020]  over the power grid they want an excuse to cut off the main internet claim
[02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:16.100]  terrorists headed so they can then only push their message on the web quote
[02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:19.860]  Obama's internet kill switch that's what this is and there's just degrees of the
[02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:25.100]  kill switch so the surveillance the censorship the control the blocking of
[02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:29.580]  websites that's just phase one and then they can do a total outage and re rewire
[02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:35.500]  and reroute if they want all websites in any region they control like China does
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:42.140]  they can reroute everybody to their message yeah I was just I was just
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:45.900]  curious if maybe you knew more about it or if why why things are kind of quiet
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:49.900]  on that front I know there's a lot of other big things with Russia and the
[02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:53.940]  COVID vaccines but that seems pretty important to kind of just not really be
[02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:59.300]  talked about seems to be going on absolutely brother good points Tyler
[02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:04.620]  thank you so much let's go ahead and talk to Mason in California you're on the
[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:09.940]  ear go ahead hey I just want to talk about some of these Zionist lies so not
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:13.460]  trying to be controversial but the Holocaust was fake you don't murder six
[02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:17.100]  million Jews that be used as labor while in the middle of a world war and the
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:20.180]  Holocaust lies to be addressed because it was important for brainwashing new
[02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:24.420]  generations after World War two it's a being blind towards race to a point we
[02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:28.660]  left foreigners who are mostly Jewish control American policies at the
[02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:32.220]  detriment for white Americans who are here for generations and this racial
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:36.140]  division is just called for anti whiteness created by Zionists and the
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:39.500]  proof is an amount of anti white headlights and media or anti white
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:43.500]  entertainment both industries are my hell of a Jewish people and white people
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:46.140]  can't be too afraid to look at this because we are currently gonna be
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:50.980]  genocided if we don't turn back also Nick Fuentes is a patriot and a genius and
[02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:54.860]  a mainstream conservative should stop announcing him thank you all right I
[02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:58.780]  appreciate your call when those guys call and they talk really fast like
[02:11:58.780 --> 02:12:01.940]  they think you're about to be cut off and oh they're like so big big secret I
[02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:04.980]  appreciate your call you know I think that was a good debate we have a
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:07.580]  Nick point I should say but the big thing that stood out for me that I'm
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:13.020]  really concerned about it's Nick's like you talk about this esoteric this
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:22.180]  nothing you know Bilderberg WF it doesn't have any power and that's the actual
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:27.740]  globalist the actual people the actual ones running things on record and it's
[02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:32.980]  like oh no Alex distracts us all with the World Economic Forum and with the
[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:40.260]  Bilderberg group and all that I mean just come on people so all Jews are bad but
[02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:45.020]  let's not look at the WF let's not look at the Bilderberg group so just average
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:49.460]  Jews you know driving a bus or a school teacher or whatever a doctor you know
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:52.620]  they're bad I'm not saying Nick's saying that but that's the whole overall
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:59.060]  bit of this but then oh Bilderberg group World Economic Forum well I mean those
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:03.180]  guys like a conference at the Holiday Inn I mean those guys don't run anything
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:12.100]  okay that doesn't that doesn't hunt that dog doesn't hunt let's go to David in
[02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:17.140]  New Jersey David thanks for calling go ahead hey brother I know you for what
[02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:23.940]  you do you're great I love you too brother what's on your mind hey first of
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:30.020]  all I'll pray for great leadership that's where we start and my proposition
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:36.140]  is that Brazil style protests are the next thing we need and I wonder if you
[02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:40.820]  agree and if you haven't got about how you get there how would you organize to
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:47.340]  get that going well I mean Brazil just had their own January 6 false flag they
[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:51.460]  caught the feds pride you know the globalist trying to oppose his violent
[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:56.340]  people trying to pose his Bolsonaro supporters and this is it's the same
[02:13:56.340 --> 02:14:02.140]  playbook of the State Department to overthrow governments and I mean you
[02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:06.180]  know is Brazil even successful right now stopping the election fraud I get
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:09.740]  their people are more energetic they're in the streets tens of millions of them
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:14.540]  but that is a question why aren't Americans more vocal well we saw the
[02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:18.180]  election being stolen on January 6 we went to peacefully demonstrate against
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:22.500]  it and call for a 10-day Senate hearing which is lawful and then they
[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:25.900]  provocateur it to set us up and call us all terrorists and throw a thousand
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:30.180]  people in jail so that was the system intimidating the American people the
[02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:35.940]  Brazilians aren't as easily intimidated yeah they've had some success
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:40.300]  apparently the military is pushing back against the judicial system which is
[02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:45.180]  corrupt well they already certified the vote on Monday and we're hearing the
[02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:48.420]  military is gonna push back and they went and killed some of the cartel leaders
[02:14:48.420 --> 02:14:52.220]  that are the muscle of the Communist show and and Bolsonaro said I'm the
[02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:54.940]  leader of the military and you know that he and he hinted he's gonna do
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:59.100]  something but clearly they stole that that election what do you think that's
[02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:05.460]  an honor to do but Bolsonaro I I think what he needs to do is what Americans
[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:09.380]  need to do is he needs a coalition of leaders he cannot be the focus Trump
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:13.140]  cannot be the focus he needs to share power he needs there need to be more
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:17.140]  targets that's a that's how a guerrilla's fight you don't want one target you
[02:15:17.140 --> 02:15:21.460]  want 50 you need 50 leaders and you got to keep going exactly the way they're
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:26.020]  going because they're not scared of Trump's campaign they're not scared of a
[02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:33.220]  lot of pundits on the radio you know although they certainly you have a big
[02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:38.500]  impact Alex but Sean Hannity's not scaring these guys they're scared of
[02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:43.020]  people and but the leaders need to know how to organize I hear you man we're
[02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:47.500]  trying as best we can brother and now I appreciate your advice we'll try to I'll

[02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:13.820]  the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates
[02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:17.660]  and the school shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs
[02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:22.700]  possible it made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to
[02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:27.500]  support info wars despite the massive law fair being waged against info wars
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:32.300]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:36.860]  ordinary people the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives
[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:41.540]  healthier wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that
[02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:47.020]  does is keep the populist message alive in an era in an age of totalitarian

[02:20:54.220 --> 02:20:58.300]  leftist aren't capable of surviving economic collapse here's why it's a big
[02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:04.060]  thick article by Brandon Smith at alt-market.us and it's a very important
[02:21:04.060 --> 02:21:08.740]  story they are the most domesticated the most dumbed-down statistically the most
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:13.740]  unself-sufficient people there are and they're clamoring that their resources
[02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:21.460]  taken away and be slaves they have Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness
[02:21:21.460 --> 02:21:24.980]  so the biggest thing you can do to protect yourself is remove yourself from
[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:28.900]  liberal areas I know you're like what are you doing sitting in Austin Texas it's

[02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:51.580]  feeling good how long ago did you get awake and what made you get ready and
[02:22:51.580 --> 02:22:55.900]  for what I've heard is the process of getting out of the city just makes
[02:22:55.900 --> 02:23:01.740]  people high as a kite it just feels so good well I was living on Maui about
[02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:05.620]  eight years ago started listening to you and of course you know a couple of the
[02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:10.660]  guys quail and Adams and I said you know what it's time and I ended up out
[02:23:10.660 --> 02:23:15.660]  here in North Carolina I'm from Arizona originally and I just a bet it's
[02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:19.900]  taken me a good four years to get where I'm at as far as ready for us I think
[02:23:19.900 --> 02:23:24.340]  it's gonna happen pretty soon let me give you a quick story so I like to do
[02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:28.340]  theater I'm a live theater performer haven't done it in years because you
[02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:32.740]  know they want everybody to be fully vaccinated so a couple days ago I get
[02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:37.180]  the call that hey we're gonna let you do a play even though you're unvaccinated
[02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:41.900]  everybody else there has three or four shots but just don't say anything to
[02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:46.180]  anyone so I'm in this play right and I'm sitting around looking at everybody
[02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:49.220]  talking with everyone let me tell you there there's a difference between
[02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:54.300]  people who have four jabs and someone who doesn't it's a mind difference it
[02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:58.140]  reminds me when they got prions growing in them they got mad cow disease they got
[02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:03.460]  sludge in their veins yeah yeah it reminds me I was in Germany you know
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:07.380]  about 20 years ago I was fascinated with how the German people went along with
[02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:10.780]  Hitler and all this stuff and so I went to these camps Auschwitz and the other
[02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:13.860]  one and I walked around the neighborhoods and I talk to some Germans they
[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:17.180]  speak pretty good English I said how did they do it how did the Nazis do it they
[02:24:17.180 --> 02:24:22.460]  all said drug and mind control they drug the water and they use intelligence
[02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:26.780]  level mind control on people I'm going well gee that sounds familiar that's
[02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:31.060]  kind of what they're doing today so my my thinking is that you know everybody
[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:34.980]  that's it got this poison in them and they're spraying the air as well they're
[02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:38.740]  going to get hurt they're going to get invited into these FEMA camps that's
[02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:41.780]  what's going to happen oh that's how they normalize the FEMA camps is the
[02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:45.940]  COVID camps which the UN admits is to break us up during economic collapse
[02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:50.260]  your Edward Dowd has you know top hedge fund people advising him he's brought
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:53.420]  up major whistleblowers like he said he would and they all know this and they're
[02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:58.020]  scared too I mean no one is going to do well in this even the globalists that
[02:24:58.020 --> 02:25:01.700]  are doing it they're doing it they think to protect themselves they are
[02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:05.500]  destroying the free society that did protect them amazing call thank you
[02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:11.300]  Darrell Aaron in Kentucky here on the year you got the best statesman in the
[02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:16.180]  country right there in your state the great Rand Paul Aaron go ahead thanks
[02:25:16.180 --> 02:25:19.340]  Alex you're taking my call brother we do have great representation here both of
[02:25:19.340 --> 02:25:22.940]  Thomas Massey and with Rand Paul so very excited that we have some kind of
[02:25:22.940 --> 02:25:26.660]  stalwarts there for the Constitution but you know the reason I was calling was
[02:25:26.660 --> 02:25:30.020]  because the other day on Harrison show he talked about that German molecular
[02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:34.700]  biologist that was that revealed that concept of the artificial wound facility
[02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:38.220]  and they talked about incubating up to 30,000 they said all humans will be
[02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:42.540]  basically corporate controlled corporate made that's their end game you know I
[02:25:42.540 --> 02:25:46.820]  got to thinking about that is the the why would they want to be doing that if
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:51.780]  they're always worried about the overpopulation so I got to thinking it
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:57.060]  dawned on me that they could create these labs and essentially create tens of
[02:25:57.060 --> 02:26:01.700]  thousands if not hundreds of thousands of children that they can then use for
[02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:05.660]  their sex activities for sex trafficking and then completely exactly it turns
[02:26:05.660 --> 02:26:09.340]  humans into a commodity they can remove certain genes create a humanoid
[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:13.020]  it's not really a human and then they're going to say under transgenderism
[02:26:13.020 --> 02:26:17.980]  that's really a human it's got to have rights exactly and on top of that they
[02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:21.140]  can also use those children to harvest for adrenochrome they can use them for
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:25.820]  child sacrifice but the bigger key is we will be basically sterilized by the
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:29.540]  radiation the electromagnetics and the chemicals and biologicals so you'll have
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:33.500]  to go to a lab to even have a kid see and you don't know what they do in the
[02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:37.220]  back doors it's like an iPhone has back doors trojan horses you don't know what
[02:26:37.220 --> 02:26:41.060]  they're supposedly doing with the child you think you're getting exactly so
[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:43.860]  we're there they're going to move us all to invite the sperm counts are down as
[02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:47.300]  you've covered on the show before children aren't going to know how to
[02:26:47.300 --> 02:26:50.340]  actually procreate so they're gonna have to do all this in a lab because it'd be
[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:54.580]  so confused they don't understand where children or babies come from anymore so
[02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:58.140]  it's gonna be a massive confusion for everybody and I'm just I get to worry
[02:26:58.140 --> 02:27:00.940]  about this because even though the children are created there in a lab
[02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:04.580]  they still have to be created with the with a woman's egg and a man's sperm and
[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:08.980]  that is a soul a creature that has a soul a person that is created in the image
[02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:13.180]  of God so if these children are being created and harvested and used for the
[02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:18.340]  the purposes of the of the elite there's still people with souls and they're
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:22.140]  going to be used for torture and for sex activities now it's completely take
[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:25.900]  off all the attention of the turning humans and animals turning us into
[02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:29.860]  commodities and they can they can go in there they could pick what child they
[02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:33.420]  want they can pick what what what gender they are well not gender I'm sorry we
[02:27:33.420 --> 02:27:38.420]  don't have that anymore they can pick the factory farm humanoids and you're
[02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:42.220]  right they're gonna grow real humans in these but they're already remember like
[02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:47.700]  oh Boston creates weaponized cover the kills 80% of humanized mice those mice
[02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:52.340]  are part human and they're trying when you think it's all a part of the
[02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:55.860]  dehumanization process as well because if we're created in the image of God and
[02:27:55.860 --> 02:28:00.260]  we're supposed to be engaging in sexual intercourse to have children but they
[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:03.340]  remove that dignity from us now everything goes to the government and the
[02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:07.100]  government then steps in to the place of God that's it and that's what they want
[02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:10.500]  to teach us drag Queen story time and two men can have babies we accept all
[02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:15.340]  this idiocy now accept factory farmed humanoids great point thank you so

[02:36:41.380 --> 02:36:47.860]  scoops out there there's a direct line of transmission between Robert Maxwell
[02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:55.980]  through Gillain Epstein and Bankman Freed that line of transmission is Robert
[02:36:55.980 --> 02:37:02.660]  Maxwell had a Mossad business partner business okay of Mossad named Samuel
[02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:09.300]  Pizarre Samuel Pizarre is the adoptive father of our sitting secretary of
[02:37:09.300 --> 02:37:16.260]  state Anthony Blankin so the old Biden slush bond running through run by
[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:20.700]  Victoria Newland Robert Kagan the peanut crowd is a direct line of
[02:37:20.700 --> 02:37:25.700]  transmission through Bankman Freed and that's a headline about as fresh as the
[02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:30.020]  morning do. Well you know I can confirm what you're saying I know those names
[02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:35.500]  and other interrelated I mean it's clear to say and it's true that the FTX
[02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:43.660]  situation is a Mossad slash Deep State Democrat Party operation. Bankman Freed
[02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:48.740]  is in terrific danger they're gonna give him a roll of Kevlar toilet paper and
[02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:56.900]  the poor man be harping with the angels it's he's he's got Patsy written all
[02:37:56.900 --> 02:38:01.540]  over him. Wow you're a smart caller I totally agree one card what else you
[02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:09.340]  want to add? You know Zagami had a wonderful segment and I love the man he
[02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:16.740]  mentions the Hollywood the Alistair Crowley the Jimmy Page connection Anton
[02:38:16.740 --> 02:38:25.340]  Levi. Few people are aware if they look up the birthname of what sounds so very
[02:38:25.340 --> 02:38:34.060]  German as Karl Marx we find that he was entered the world as Mordecai Levi Karl
[02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:41.420]  Marx that is. So the Khazars the Ukraine that is were known as the name
[02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:47.980]  Steelers or the Hospitallers giving hospitality to travelers and then
[02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:54.820]  stealing their documents their travel papers assuming their identity and going
[02:38:54.820 --> 02:39:00.380]  on to their destination posing as the original person astride the silk trade
[02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:06.900]  routes which were actually the opium routes. Okay we might go back to Brown
[02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:14.420]  Brothers Harriman and the Shanghai Shek heroin connection that was being run
[02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:21.020]  by General Claire Channault Flying Tiger Airlines big Hawaii overtones. Shout
[02:39:21.020 --> 02:39:27.620]  out to Edward Dowd Maui resident doing a great job over there and and as you are
[02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:33.580]  too wonderful wonderful work. Well one card Monty really powerful points thanks
[02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:39.580]  for holding to cover that sir. Wow bone crusher infomerings in 10 you're on the
[02:39:39.580 --> 02:39:52.700]  air. Yeah. Yeah I'm fired up today Alex. All right I just want to say that Alex
[02:39:52.700 --> 02:39:56.860]  you've been fighting the globalist longer than Nick Fuentes has been outside of
[02:39:56.860 --> 02:40:01.700]  his daddy's testicles okay. But I mean I'm not in competition with Nick I just
[02:40:01.700 --> 02:40:05.700]  I just you know I'm like why did Hitler attack Poland he goes well they attack
[02:40:05.700 --> 02:40:09.940]  Germany no they didn't it was declassified the Germans in a false flag why
[02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:13.620]  would Poland horseback troops attack the biggest military in the world it just I
[02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:21.500]  just like this this fetishizing Hitler I don't like it. No I know it and I get it
[02:40:21.500 --> 02:40:26.460]  and you know you had Nick on the other day again and he's okay he's got his
[02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:30.660]  points of view but he's not not exactly my guy but you should you got to get
[02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:35.820]  yay back on that's everybody wants to hear from and Nick is just kind of trying
[02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:40.740]  to read yay's coattails and I don't blame him that's great and all but Kanye is
[02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:44.580]  somebody that's got he's got fashion lines he sold millions of hit records
[02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:48.540]  he's the guy that went on live TV and told everybody that George Bush doesn't
[02:40:48.540 --> 02:40:52.380]  care about black people like this is the guy that everybody wants to hear from
[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:56.340]  Nick Fuentes was best known for being like a nose picker or something like
[02:40:56.340 --> 02:41:02.100]  that before he met up with Kanye. Well I'm not trying to get the middle of all
[02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:07.900]  of it I just Kanye goes to these cycles where he wants to be on there he didn't
[02:41:07.900 --> 02:41:11.220]  want to be on there but I think in a few weeks we'll probably get him back on
[02:41:11.220 --> 02:41:14.980]  there so I would definitely look for that I appreciate your call. Let's jam in one

[02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:42.540]  when good people take action evil fails that's why they say that all the evil
[02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:46.020]  men and tires seem to flourish is that good men and women do nothing Thomas

[02:48:14.740 --> 02:48:18.940]  great tell us about yourself and what you're seeing at work my name is
[02:48:18.940 --> 02:48:26.380]  Stephanie and I work at somewhere in Washington at a shelter and a lot of my
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:32.140]  friends family co-workers are vaccinated but me I just think that they
[02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:38.340]  don't understand and they don't believe the danger of the vaccine and I just I
[02:48:38.340 --> 02:48:43.780]  don't know I think there's something needs to happen before I think they
[02:48:43.780 --> 02:48:47.820]  before they believe or before they change their mind well yeah I would send
[02:48:47.820 --> 02:48:51.180]  them the Edward Dow interview last hour once it's archived demand a video I mean
[02:48:51.180 --> 02:48:54.780]  because they don't believe people would try to hurt them in the system but that's
[02:48:54.780 --> 02:49:01.620]  actually what's happening yeah and I really don't know what to say what to
[02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:07.660]  think for them anymore because my daughter my son they're all vaccinated
[02:49:07.660 --> 02:49:14.500]  and they just basically nod their head I don't know how to convince them you
[02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:19.100]  know well what do you think should happen to Fauci is it as all this news
[02:49:19.100 --> 02:49:29.860]  comes out I think I think something needs to happen he needs to go to jail he
[02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:37.020]  needs to pay for everything he needs people need to show need to show that
[02:49:37.020 --> 02:49:45.660]  you know he is not fall and this is all bad everything is bad I agree and as the

[02:50:20.780 --> 02:50:30.100]  submitting I got it I don't the X3 I have a sorority cough right it's and
[02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:34.780]  up for years and years and years I have these like sores that would like come up
[02:50:34.780 --> 02:50:39.660]  on my joints and they would like never heal I ended up taking it about like I
[02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:46.460]  say about six nine months it started you up clear it up and I want to thank you
[02:50:46.460 --> 02:50:50.220]  for that I mean I've tried I've tried like countless other brother you and
[02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:54.220]  admits that over two billion people have serious skin problems health problems
[02:50:54.220 --> 02:50:57.980]  mental problems because of lack of iodine most items bound in the soil or
[02:50:57.980 --> 02:51:01.780]  what you're eating so yeah this is a big game changer I wish we had x2 and x3 and
[02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:06.220]  stock it sold out but yeah you can get it from higher quality Himalayan salts
[02:51:06.220 --> 02:51:10.820]  there are other places to get the iodine it's not as good as x2 or x3 ours is
[02:51:10.820 --> 02:51:15.980]  purified atomic you know absolutely a hundred percent pharmaceutical grade but
[02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:20.820]  regardless iodine is the secret in fact my I got taken out my desk we'll see
[02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:24.100]  somebody bring me a bottle of that I was what been wanting some last week go
[02:51:24.100 --> 02:51:30.740]  ahead sir okay what I wanted to get at today was regarding Nick Fuentes I think
[02:51:30.740 --> 02:51:34.660]  I have some insight into what Nick was getting at with crossing the Zillow line
[02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:39.260]  you know why at our godless morality nowadays it's centered around this man
[02:51:39.260 --> 02:51:44.020]  who is like from 80 years ago this sacred cow needs to be slaughtered in order
[02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:48.100]  for us to get back to Christian morality as a nation well Hitler was actually
[02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:53.580]  anti-Christian on record and they go oh Hitler's a Christian no he wasn't and
[02:51:53.580 --> 02:51:57.540]  just because the globalist act like he's the bogeyman when they help create
[02:51:57.540 --> 02:52:04.060]  him doesn't mean he's then good well Alex it's not the blood of Hitler it's
[02:52:04.060 --> 02:52:07.140]  the blood of Christ that's the only thing that's going to cure the sickness in
[02:52:07.140 --> 02:52:11.020]  this nation we guys start worrying about this dude from so many years ago who
[02:52:11.020 --> 02:52:17.020]  doesn't affect our lives now we're living in the now let's worry for today well
[02:52:17.020 --> 02:52:20.580]  I agree with you here to read that Hitler is not a good guy thanks for the
[02:52:20.580 --> 02:52:24.500]  call let's talk to Evan in California Evan go ahead
[02:52:24.500 --> 02:52:28.820]  awesome hey it's great to talk to you today Alex hey Alex I want to point out
[02:52:28.820 --> 02:52:34.700]  that and I do not look for trouble today but the people like Nick Fuentes and
[02:52:34.700 --> 02:52:39.100]  the Milo they got one thing in common and if they all say they're Catholics even
[02:52:39.100 --> 02:52:43.060]  though the Catholic Church is probably the greatest funder of NGOs trafficking
[02:52:43.060 --> 02:52:47.780]  kids across the border we got billions coming from our government going to
[02:52:47.780 --> 02:52:51.500]  there are a lot of great Catholic people but the Catholic Church is working
[02:52:51.500 --> 02:52:55.420]  with Biden to smuggle millions across the border including children there's no
[02:52:55.420 --> 02:53:00.660]  doubt they're doing it yep and I was essentially you know born and raised the
[02:53:00.660 --> 02:53:05.860]  Catholic and then I came to Christ when I needed to and I just want to point out
[02:53:05.860 --> 02:53:09.260]  and I hope I hope I don't get you mad at me man you're the closest thing we got
[02:53:09.260 --> 02:53:15.540]  to better you can say anything you want I got thick skin okay Andrew Tate is the
[02:53:15.540 --> 02:53:21.020]  New World Order's attempt to hijack the Alex Jones message and the message of
[02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:26.540]  truth we've got a guy who was essentially promoting fans only pages he's
[02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:31.660]  part of essentially the degrade yourself ladies world and then he's a tough
[02:53:31.660 --> 02:53:35.380]  dude he's got a lot of things going for him but and then he talks and he says a
[02:53:35.380 --> 02:53:38.700]  lot of the things that you're saying and then all of a sudden he says hey look
[02:53:38.700 --> 02:53:43.340]  for having five girlfriends America look for having a baghati but he then
[02:53:43.340 --> 02:53:48.340]  denies Christ I wouldn't doubt if you got a free baghati to deny Christ there's
[02:53:48.340 --> 02:53:51.500]  there's billionaires trillionaires that will pay you to do stuff like that I
[02:53:51.500 --> 02:53:57.340]  want to point Alex I want to point out Alex to you that I'm Evan Knight I have
[02:53:57.340 --> 02:54:03.900]  a JCWM1.com Jesus Christ Worldwide Ministry I'm mad with no budget I do
[02:54:03.900 --> 02:54:08.700]  what I can and I'm pointing this out to you months ago there's Christians calm
[02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:12.260]  there's people calling themselves Christians that believe Jesus existed
[02:54:12.260 --> 02:54:18.420]  every demon in hell believes Jesus existed and even Jesus told the demons
[02:54:18.420 --> 02:54:23.820]  don't mention my name because every demon in hell knows that Jesus everybody
[02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:27.300]  knows that Jesus in the heart and I believe the New World Order is trying to
[02:54:27.300 --> 02:54:31.540]  put enough pressure on you that you have to endorse an Andrew Tate vitamin when
[02:54:31.540 --> 02:54:36.500]  frankly you're ahead of the curve this is your gig and I believe no I mean I
[02:54:36.500 --> 02:54:39.820]  mean I like you Andrew Tate he came with some vitamins and he's a sponsor so
[02:54:39.820 --> 02:54:43.260]  we're selling this it's good it's good quality products I mean he's not perfect
[02:54:43.260 --> 02:54:47.020]  and I've seen some of the things he's done and I'm not you know I'm not my
[02:54:47.020 --> 02:54:50.260]  brother's keeper but I hear what you're saying no no New World Order didn't call

[02:58:50.940 --> 02:58:56.700]  over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter
[02:58:56.700 --> 02:59:02.700]  because of something called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with
[02:59:02.700 --> 02:59:07.460]  cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that
[02:59:07.460 --> 02:59:13.540]  killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see the sun
[02:59:13.540 --> 02:59:19.420]  via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting
[02:59:19.420 --> 02:59:24.020]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses
[02:59:24.020 --> 02:59:27.780]  and other things to start replicating and taking your body over so now it's
[02:59:27.780 --> 02:59:30.900]  more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality

[03:00:03.860 --> 03:00:08.340]  all right keep down we sit to take over but I want to finish these calls up in
[03:00:08.340 --> 03:00:14.580]  a few final news items the crews give me this story three times the last two
[03:00:14.580 --> 03:00:18.620]  days and I should cover it it shows the absurdity of the vaccine cult who'll hit
[03:00:18.620 --> 03:00:25.460]  that start the next segment let's talk to Carlos in Canada you're on here go
[03:00:25.460 --> 03:00:31.980]  ahead Carlos thank you Alex just want to draw a line which people really should
[03:00:31.980 --> 03:00:38.020]  keep in mind when they're pursuing the current abuses of the mRNA vaccines on
[03:00:38.020 --> 03:00:43.580]  people Donald Rumsfeld was a chairman of a company called Gilead Sciences
[03:00:43.580 --> 03:00:49.780]  largest shareholder Ronald Rumsfeld was behind the tamiflu medication that
[03:00:49.780 --> 03:00:55.620]  didn't work but which was given to people who received the H1N1 virus the
[03:00:55.620 --> 03:01:04.060]  SARS-1 okay SARS-1 SARS-2 SARS-3 were in fact three programmed releases after
[03:01:04.060 --> 03:01:09.060]  Donald Rumsfeld there was a man by the name of George Soros who incorporated a
[03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:14.540]  company called Wuxi in the Caribbean check its portfolio holdings and you'll
[03:01:14.540 --> 03:01:20.020]  find that that was there and then Wuxi did a joint venture with Gilead Sciences
[03:01:20.020 --> 03:01:27.140]  the company that manufactures Remdesivir now doesn't that sound familiar now if
[03:01:27.140 --> 03:01:31.740]  you look through the SARS-1 SARS-2 chronology and you look at the
[03:01:31.740 --> 03:01:37.300]  shareholders of the various people behind this then you find your agencies
[03:01:37.300 --> 03:01:42.820]  coming right through to what is the old story of creating a disease and then
[03:01:42.820 --> 03:01:47.620]  finding a cure that you can sell to everybody that's dying of the disease
[03:01:47.620 --> 03:01:54.900]  basic story why it wasn't stopped in 2007 is why in 2020 you had SARS-2 we
[03:01:54.900 --> 03:01:59.060]  must now stop it so that there's no SARS-3 coming down the pipe because it's
[03:01:59.060 --> 03:02:04.140]  all about making money and and you know the old story the medicines don't work
[03:02:04.140 --> 03:02:09.340]  Quebec province of Quebec paid two billion dollars to buy this medication
[03:02:09.340 --> 03:02:15.460]  and Canada per capita is the largest holder of this new medications that we
[03:02:15.460 --> 03:02:23.100]  bought forward to the year 2024-25 they won't control over our bodies Carlos
[03:02:23.100 --> 03:02:30.140]  great point thank you Alex another point is that technology should not run the
[03:02:30.140 --> 03:02:35.420]  world you know the human brain is not a digital computer all these technologies
[03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:38.820]  one day you and I will talk about this yeah they want to turn us into machines
[03:02:38.820 --> 03:02:42.620]  the computers are only powerful because we interface with them and give them
[03:02:42.620 --> 03:02:48.060]  power all this AI art is our art scrambled together motherhood will
[03:02:48.060 --> 03:02:53.500]  defeat any efforts to make children out of test tubes or bypassing the uterus
[03:02:53.500 --> 03:02:58.940]  it's failure it will they will fail thank you Carlos Robert and Thailand here
[03:02:58.940 --> 03:03:04.780]  on the air go ahead oh Alex I'm so excited they announced that fusion energy
[03:03:04.780 --> 03:03:09.860]  breakthrough there's no way that they had that suppressed technology before yeah
[03:03:09.860 --> 03:03:14.220]  it was it was in the literature 30 years ago they had that well you know
[03:03:14.220 --> 03:03:19.140]  similar to you you know I have a little bit of a exposure to this my dad actually
[03:03:19.140 --> 03:03:23.180]  touched the Hubble telescope he was in the labs with the security clearance over
[03:03:23.180 --> 03:03:26.980]  there and had to wear a glove of course but he worked in a rocky flat in north
[03:03:26.980 --> 03:03:31.220]  of frontman department of energy and gave me a lot of insights growing up and I
[03:03:31.220 --> 03:03:34.740]  didn't necessarily listen to all of it but some of that stuff is coming to the
[03:03:34.740 --> 03:03:39.740]  forefront now and I wanted to talk about Werner or Werner von Braun and his
[03:03:39.740 --> 03:03:46.260]  deathbed confession and then his other his other prediction I guess about Elon
[03:03:46.260 --> 03:03:49.780]  which I just found out about recently which is really really weird where he
[03:03:49.780 --> 03:03:54.780]  talks about you know the you have to have a bad guy to keep everybody in
[03:03:54.780 --> 03:03:59.300]  control there always has to be an enemy to attack or to be afraid of he said it
[03:03:59.300 --> 03:04:02.620]  would progress from one thing to the next I'm sure you've heard of this one and
[03:04:02.620 --> 03:04:08.300]  then that ultimately he would say oh my god UAPs they're a big threat to us not
[03:04:08.300 --> 03:04:12.300]  as though they could have wiped their butt with us by now if they wanted to
[03:04:12.300 --> 03:04:16.380]  because they're so far ahead in technology which obviously means they're
[03:04:16.380 --> 03:04:19.580]  really really restraint and they're really really easy going because we've
[03:04:19.580 --> 03:04:23.660]  been shooting them down we've been shooting them down why would they you
[03:04:23.660 --> 03:04:26.900]  know sit around waiting if they were violent and a threat I think people
[03:04:26.900 --> 03:04:31.100]  need to look out for that and not listen to that narrative when it comes out
[03:04:31.100 --> 03:04:34.860]  don't hang up Robert I want to come back and have you finish up your points
[03:04:34.860 --> 03:04:42.020]  about Werner von Braun and Elon Musk there's a whole Elon situation that I'm
[03:04:42.020 --> 03:04:44.420]  gonna finish up with Patriot and Barry got to go quick though because Kate
[03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:48.940]  Daly always has an amazing show with huge breaking news and incredible guests
[03:04:48.940 --> 03:04:52.340]  she's taken over in like five minutes I'm gonna come back finish up with you
[03:04:52.340 --> 03:04:57.340]  callers and throw the baton to her stay with us
[03:04:57.340 --> 03:05:02.140]  the tip of the spear throughout this entire process the only thing that made
[03:05:02.140 --> 03:05:06.380]  any Republican victories tonight possible the only thing that made any
[03:05:06.380 --> 03:05:11.060]  resistance to the war machine possible the only thing that made any
[03:05:11.060 --> 03:05:15.340]  opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and
[03:05:15.340 --> 03:05:19.980]  and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible that made any
[03:05:19.980 --> 03:05:24.940]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite
[03:05:24.940 --> 03:05:28.860]  the massive lawfare being waged against info wars despite the media
[03:05:28.860 --> 03:05:34.060]  defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the ordinary people the
[03:05:34.060 --> 03:05:38.260]  everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier wealthier
[03:05:38.260 --> 03:05:42.900]  and wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is keep the
[03:05:42.900 --> 03:05:47.940]  populist message alive in an era in an age of totalitarian oppression so
[03:05:47.940 --> 03:05:52.260]  continue to do it go to places like info wars store.com go to the places like
[03:05:52.260 --> 03:05:56.940]  save info wars continue to keep info wars alive because in the process you're
[03:05:56.940 --> 03:06:00.100]  keeping america liberty alive
[03:06:01.020 --> 03:06:06.700]  and we are now five minutes six minutes into our number four Kate Daly sitting
[03:06:06.700 --> 03:06:11.420]  to take over but Robert in Thailand codifying kind of bring together your
[03:06:11.420 --> 03:06:16.700]  comments as I know about this Werner von Braun the Nazis Elon Musk kind of
[03:06:16.700 --> 03:06:21.740]  quantify what you're saying well you know I mean there was this deathbed
[03:06:21.740 --> 03:06:26.140]  confession apparently that von Braun made when he you know was about to die
[03:06:26.140 --> 03:06:29.700]  and he said well you know there's a what's gonna happen is they're gonna
[03:06:29.700 --> 03:06:33.620]  create to continue the fear based mind control there's gonna be various threats
[03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:38.420]  including a nuclear threat and then an alien invasion threat and you know
[03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:43.340]  obviously he was really close to you know high clearance does not had a lot of
[03:06:43.340 --> 03:06:47.740]  sight to that the next thing was apparently he predicted that somebody
[03:06:47.740 --> 03:06:51.700]  named Elon would be taking us to Mars I just thought out about this in the last
[03:06:51.700 --> 03:06:56.340]  few days and that's just why I couldn't help calling and so it's really just to
[03:06:56.340 --> 03:06:59.700]  look at and when you listen to his narrative versus he wrote a science
[03:06:59.700 --> 03:07:07.540]  fiction book where a a dictator takes over Mars is called Elon yeah yeah and
[03:07:07.540 --> 03:07:12.100]  it's really weird too because you have this Greer versus Elizondo debate where
[03:07:12.100 --> 03:07:16.420]  Elizondo is making people afraid of the UAPs and Greer is like no that's bullcrap
[03:07:16.420 --> 03:07:19.420]  they're using it to make us afraid I think that's an interesting narrative
[03:07:19.420 --> 03:07:25.980]  right there I hear you great points thank you Barry in Kentucky than Patriot
[03:07:25.980 --> 03:07:30.780]  in Texas last callers go ahead Barry hey Alex I just want to say something real
[03:07:30.780 --> 03:07:35.740]  quick here now easy to start with it's that Obama is responsible for the
[03:07:35.740 --> 03:07:40.500]  degradation of the modern-day man and that one time and period American was
[03:07:40.500 --> 03:07:45.780]  the month was the complete owner of all the machine tool manufacturing
[03:07:45.780 --> 03:07:49.620]  technology during COVID most of these companies were bought up they were
[03:07:49.620 --> 03:07:54.220]  liquidated by Italian Japanese Chinese companies and we are now going to see the
[03:07:54.220 --> 03:07:58.180]  hurt from that what that involves is empty classrooms for machining we need
[03:07:58.180 --> 03:08:02.100]  to get involved with it we need to get back to a point in America where we can
[03:08:02.100 --> 03:08:06.380]  produce the machines that produce machines we are hurting because of this
[03:08:06.380 --> 03:08:11.340]  fact and the truth is our technology was stolen and Obama is responsible for most
[03:08:11.340 --> 03:08:15.540]  of it I agree just like they're shutting off our power supply our borders our
[03:08:15.540 --> 03:08:21.860]  pipelines America is under economic attack aim into that brother there was a
[03:08:21.860 --> 03:08:26.660]  time where America was the leading machine tool manufacturer and we need to
[03:08:26.660 --> 03:08:31.100]  get back to that hell we were just four years ago two years ago the number one
[03:08:31.100 --> 03:08:35.900]  oil producer energy producer now we're not we are being shut down anything else
[03:08:35.900 --> 03:08:41.420]  yeah I just want to say you know God bless everybody and now you know let's
[03:08:41.420 --> 03:08:45.260]  just do what we can keep our heads high and keep one another close to each other
[03:08:45.260 --> 03:08:49.700]  that respect each other absolutely God bless you Barry all right patriot in
[03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:55.340]  Texas last caller you're on here hey Alex thank you for taking my call yes sir
[03:08:55.340 --> 03:09:00.100]  I'd like to say that we live in the end times and we live in a time of false
[03:09:00.100 --> 03:09:04.900]  profit and I think they're kind of cutting everybody off the section by
[03:09:04.900 --> 03:09:10.660]  section you kind of see it in real time with the CNN boomers CNN used to be had
[03:09:10.660 --> 03:09:16.740]  some good interviews and some good people I think they interviewed Orwell so they
[03:09:16.740 --> 03:09:22.500]  they get trust from all these people and they just change on a dial and start
[03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:26.740]  shooting the propaganda but they're so loyal to the old news they used to be
[03:09:26.740 --> 03:09:32.060]  truthful that they stick around same thing with Fox I mean people are so loyal
[03:09:32.060 --> 03:09:36.340]  too because it said some truth and they're turning on them and you know
[03:09:36.340 --> 03:09:41.780]  people are stuck with their loyalty same thing with Trump everyone you know he
[03:09:41.780 --> 03:09:46.860]  had great rhetoric taken down the swamps that great things but we see
[03:09:46.860 --> 03:09:51.860]  where his interests are with the Pfizer backing with the Israeli backing and I
[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:57.220]  mean he's the creator of warp speed so you know we got to be open to this
[03:09:57.220 --> 03:10:01.540]  information but also don't be loyal to any of these people because they're false
[03:10:01.540 --> 03:10:07.180]  profit not agree we got to be loyal to the truth and promote the truth yes and
[03:10:07.180 --> 03:10:11.860]  don't promote them when they change you know be able to change with them I like

[03:11:27.180 --> 03:11:30.940]  second guest is Pam Bartha and so we have so much to talk about two incredibly
[03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:35.340]  different topics today Alex Newman award-winning journalist you know who he
[03:11:35.340 --> 03:11:41.100]  is educator author consultant with the new American and a multitude of media
[03:11:41.100 --> 03:11:45.180]  outlets so a few weeks ago he attended what I call the I just call him now like
[03:11:45.180 --> 03:11:51.380]  the 666th global meeting of evil and so I don't know what else to say anymore I
[03:11:51.380 --> 03:11:55.340]  mean they keep meeting and they keep making well-laid plans for us Alex
[03:11:55.340 --> 03:12:00.380]  attended in person and I cannot wait to hear what happened with the interviews
[03:12:00.380 --> 03:12:05.180]  of the religious leaders and afterwards and what happened at this event welcome
[03:12:05.180 --> 03:12:08.700]  Alex Newman how are you doing great it's so great to be here thank you so much
[03:12:08.700 --> 03:12:13.900]  Penn thank you so much Alex really appreciate it so you have to tell me
[03:12:13.900 --> 03:12:18.380]  about this meeting let's sum this up and talk about the attendance you know what
[03:12:18.380 --> 03:12:24.860]  does it like to attend one of these globalist thug meetings I have to know yeah
[03:12:24.860 --> 03:12:29.700]  it's I actually finished my major article just first person you know what is it
[03:12:29.700 --> 03:12:32.340]  like to attend one of these late last night about three in the morning so
[03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:35.780]  that'll be in the next issue of the new American but the whole time I'm there
[03:12:35.780 --> 03:12:41.380]  I've got this circus music playing in the background it is so ridiculous the
[03:12:41.380 --> 03:12:46.340]  problem is it's also you know terrifying circus situation you've got
[03:12:46.340 --> 03:12:50.700]  presidents I mean you have over 125 presidents and prime ministers are
[03:12:50.700 --> 03:12:54.380]  there including Joe Biden you've got John Kerry running around like you know
[03:12:54.380 --> 03:12:57.940]  Santa Claus on crystal meth throwing around American money and promises for
[03:12:57.940 --> 03:13:04.620]  bigger funding streams and it really is like a cult-like environment Kate they
[03:13:04.620 --> 03:13:08.020]  had over 40 religious ceremonies there where they say they're bringing together
[03:13:08.020 --> 03:13:12.300]  the religions of the world they unveiled a new 10 commandments the UN
[03:13:12.300 --> 03:13:16.660]  actually called for before this meeting a new system of ethics and morality to
[03:13:16.660 --> 03:13:21.460]  try to take into account taking proper care of Mother Earth and they wound up
[03:13:21.460 --> 03:13:24.020]  with another one of these huge agreements that for the first time ever
[03:13:24.020 --> 03:13:27.980]  commits Americans to pay climate reparations basically John Kerry played
[03:13:27.980 --> 03:13:32.540]  guilty on our behalf every hurricane every storm every drought every flood it's
[03:13:32.540 --> 03:13:38.860]  your fault because you know your grandpa had a car and you know brand trains and
[03:13:38.860 --> 03:13:43.180]  things like that so hugely significant meeting Kate Americans were kept totally
[03:13:43.180 --> 03:13:46.100]  in the dark about it I think because if they knew what was happening here they
[03:13:46.100 --> 03:13:50.060]  would revolt and pull the plug on this thing but it really is it's a combination
[03:13:50.060 --> 03:13:56.180]  of you know scary and hilarious to be at these things it's very bizarre I can't
[03:13:56.180 --> 03:14:00.340]  even imagine tell me a little bit about the religious I'm the meetings with the
[03:14:00.340 --> 03:14:05.060]  religious leaders what was said yeah I think that was really the most
[03:14:05.060 --> 03:14:09.260]  significant part of this whole meeting that for me was the big takeaway here is
[03:14:09.260 --> 03:14:11.540]  that you know they've already got all the governments of the world on board
[03:14:11.540 --> 03:14:15.060]  Klaus Schwab is of course bringing through the World Economic Forum bringing
[03:14:15.060 --> 03:14:19.700]  the business leaders of the world on board and Peter Drucker the management
[03:14:19.700 --> 03:14:23.700]  guru that trained people like Rick Warren right the mega church pastor out in
[03:14:23.700 --> 03:14:27.140]  California he always said that if you want to have really significant major
[03:14:27.140 --> 03:14:30.380]  global changes you've got to have the three-legged stool so governments
[03:14:30.380 --> 03:14:34.740]  business and the religions of the world and so that's what was happening you had
[03:14:34.740 --> 03:14:39.260]  this huge interfaith movement there where they brought together leaders of you
[03:14:39.260 --> 03:14:45.260]  know self-proclaimed leaders of Judaism Islam Hinduism they flew in a shaman
[03:14:45.260 --> 03:14:49.540]  from the Amazon rainforest to represent indigenous spirituality they had all
[03:14:49.540 --> 03:14:52.340]  these different denominations of Christians you know the Vatican had an
[03:14:52.340 --> 03:14:56.820]  emissary there different evangelical branches that the Orthodox were well
[03:14:56.820 --> 03:15:00.260]  represented there and they're basically saying you know we all kind of believe
[03:15:00.260 --> 03:15:03.420]  the same thing especially about Mother Earth so we're gonna usher in these new
[03:15:03.420 --> 03:15:08.660]  Ten Commandments and as fate or coincidence or divine providence would
[03:15:08.660 --> 03:15:12.860]  have it whatever you choose to believe I ran into the ring leaders of this thing
[03:15:12.860 --> 03:15:16.260]  the people that actually walked up to Mount Sinai and smashed the new Ten
[03:15:16.260 --> 03:15:20.020]  Commandments and got an exclusive 40-minute interview with them I
[03:15:20.020 --> 03:15:22.500]  encourage people to check it out but one of the things that one of the
[03:15:22.500 --> 03:15:26.620]  organizers told me the CEO of the peace department he says you know yeah we got
[03:15:26.620 --> 03:15:29.780]  some bad publicity about the new Ten Commandments so we're actually this is
[03:15:29.780 --> 03:15:33.500]  an addendum to the Ten Commandments not a new Ten Commandments he said we're
[03:15:33.500 --> 03:15:38.500]  working on the third covenant and we're gonna usher in heaven on earth we're
[03:15:38.500 --> 03:15:41.620]  gonna come right back a little bit more with Alex Newman I've got to hear more
[03:15:41.620 --> 03:15:46.100]  about this I mean you just can't believe it right this is insane and coming up
[03:15:46.100 --> 03:15:49.300]  with the new Ten Commandments I guess I don't even that doesn't even shock me
[03:15:49.300 --> 03:15:55.260]  anymore because these people are so crazy be right back on the Alex Jones show

[03:20:10.740 --> 03:20:15.340]  back here with you on the Alex Jones show I'm Kate Daly your guest host from
[03:20:15.340 --> 03:20:21.580]  KateDalyRadio.com my first guest is Alex Newman billing us in on the meeting
[03:20:21.580 --> 03:20:26.340]  they what did they pen at this time United Nations COP 27 climate change
[03:20:26.340 --> 03:20:32.220]  summit and of course they had the audacity to do this Mount Sinai and so
[03:20:32.220 --> 03:20:36.980]  you're you're there you're talking to these religious leaders Alex and I want
[03:20:36.980 --> 03:20:40.940]  to hear more I I'm sure you were probably I'm sure they had shocking things to
[03:20:40.940 --> 03:20:46.500]  say there's no doubt in my mind they really did and you know this CEO of the
[03:20:46.500 --> 03:20:51.380]  peace department when when he said that this this addendum to the 10 commandments
[03:20:51.380 --> 03:20:54.700]  was the prelude to they said they're working on the third covenant and that
[03:20:54.700 --> 03:20:59.380]  this was going to allow us to usher in the real kingdom of heaven here on earth
[03:20:59.380 --> 03:21:03.580]  I mean to me it sounded like nails on a chalkboard right and then as they're
[03:21:03.580 --> 03:21:07.260]  continuing I had all four of them here and the next one tells me yeah we've
[03:21:07.260 --> 03:21:10.940]  got to mobilize religious communities right as if you know our religions are
[03:21:10.940 --> 03:21:15.940]  just tools for these people to bring us on board at the UN climate bandwagon and
[03:21:15.940 --> 03:21:21.140]  again they had almost 40 religious events at this COP 27 summit with
[03:21:21.140 --> 03:21:25.780]  major representatives from almost all the world's major religions and what's
[03:21:25.780 --> 03:21:29.020]  happening here is a process that's been underway for a long time of the UN has
[03:21:29.020 --> 03:21:32.660]  actually been funding a lot of this so is our State Department they have an
[03:21:32.660 --> 03:21:37.380]  organization called religions for peace and this is again funded by the UN
[03:21:37.380 --> 03:21:41.340]  funded by George Soros funded by the Rockefellers by the US State Department
[03:21:41.340 --> 03:21:46.260]  etc and in 2019 they came up with this agreement it got almost no attention at
[03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:49.940]  all but it kind of laid the foundation for what came that they're going to
[03:21:49.940 --> 03:21:54.060]  create an alliance of virtue where all religions basically have the same ideas
[03:21:54.060 --> 03:21:57.940]  and virtues and beliefs and so we'll focus on what unites us and they
[03:21:57.940 --> 03:22:04.260]  actually said that we commit to human development as outlined in UN agenda
[03:22:04.260 --> 03:22:08.100]  2030 the sustainable development goals and so this was the big theme at the COP
[03:22:08.100 --> 03:22:12.780]  27 conference all the religions of the world need to join up with the UN to save
[03:22:12.780 --> 03:22:17.380]  Mother Earth what I found out as I was digging into this all these different
[03:22:17.380 --> 03:22:21.820]  shadowy groups that are involved in this Kate there being funded by foundations
[03:22:21.820 --> 03:22:26.260]  that everybody should know about one of them is the Fetzer Institute this is a
[03:22:26.260 --> 03:22:29.860]  foundation that was established by a very wealthy individual a disciple of
[03:22:29.860 --> 03:22:33.860]  Alice Bailey who was the of course the founder of the Lucifer publishing company
[03:22:33.860 --> 03:22:37.700]  etc she's very very popular with UN elites in fact the guy who wrote the
[03:22:37.700 --> 03:22:41.420]  world core curriculum assistant secretary general Robert Mueller said that the
[03:22:41.420 --> 03:22:44.940]  world core curriculum he's the father of global education he said this needs to
[03:22:44.940 --> 03:22:48.660]  be taught in every school in the world he said it's based on the teachings of
[03:22:48.660 --> 03:22:52.980]  Alice Bailey and this demon that she was communicating with that she she called
[03:22:52.980 --> 03:22:55.900]  it an ascended master and I know this stuff sounds bonkers okay but this is
[03:22:55.900 --> 03:22:59.860]  what Alice Bailey believed she was channeling these spiritual entities that
[03:22:59.860 --> 03:23:03.620]  were telling her about the coming new age and the one-world government and the
[03:23:03.620 --> 03:23:07.420]  one-world religion where everybody was going to be unified another one of the
[03:23:07.420 --> 03:23:10.980]  big funders was the Henry Lewis Foundation they are one of the big
[03:23:10.980 --> 03:23:14.140]  finance series of the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development which was
[03:23:14.140 --> 03:23:18.820]  one of the key organizers of all this and also of the Elijah Institute the
[03:23:18.820 --> 03:23:23.060]  world religious leaders as they call themselves and Henry Lewis for those who
[03:23:23.060 --> 03:23:27.620]  don't remember was the founder of Time magazine founder of Life magazine one of
[03:23:27.620 --> 03:23:32.020]  the major players in the CIA's operation Mockingbird where the CIA was putting
[03:23:32.020 --> 03:23:36.180]  journalists journalists on the payroll and having the propagandize and lie to
[03:23:36.180 --> 03:23:40.540]  the American people who was also a member of the Skellenbone secret society
[03:23:40.540 --> 03:23:44.260]  that John Kerry was a member of that George Bush actually Bush is going back
[03:23:44.260 --> 03:23:47.900]  several generations and he was called to get this and this is in the mainstream
[03:23:47.900 --> 03:23:52.300]  media he was called by his fellow Bones men bail which is of course that you know
[03:23:52.300 --> 03:23:55.460]  the demon god of the Canaanites that likes child sacrifice and these types of
[03:23:55.460 --> 03:24:01.060]  things so you don't have to dig very far Kate to find a really nasty diabolical
[03:24:01.060 --> 03:24:05.740]  underbelly to this whole one-world religion new ten commandments movement
[03:24:05.740 --> 03:24:10.300]  and it was really on full display at this conference well they're not afraid
[03:24:10.300 --> 03:24:14.900]  to show us who they are for certain I and that is really telling everybody
[03:24:14.900 --> 03:24:18.100]  should take that in my grandmother used to say when they show you who you really
[03:24:18.100 --> 03:24:22.780]  out that who they really are believe them and they have no problem showing you
[03:24:22.780 --> 03:24:26.980]  the crazy the freak flag and telling you what they believe in so the really the
[03:24:26.980 --> 03:24:31.700]  only unifier for all the religions which makes no sense is the love for Mother
[03:24:31.700 --> 03:24:36.580]  Earth the worship for Mother Earth that replaces God right that's exactly right
[03:24:36.580 --> 03:24:40.060]  Kate and one of the rabbis who was one of the leaders of this you know he was
[03:24:40.060 --> 03:24:43.100]  purporting to represent Judaism although you know I know plenty plenty of
[03:24:43.100 --> 03:24:48.740]  Jews who were absolutely aghast at this but he gave me on camera a copy of his
[03:24:48.740 --> 03:24:55.380]  eco Bible okay it's the eco perspective on the Hebrew scriptures and he
[03:24:55.380 --> 03:24:59.580]  actually quoted Genesis for me and you know again it was like nails on a chalk
[03:24:59.580 --> 03:25:04.220]  board he said yeah God put the human being in the garden to serve it like
[03:25:04.220 --> 03:25:08.820]  what God did put us here to serve the guy so I looked up every major English
[03:25:08.820 --> 03:25:12.660]  translation there's no translation that says God put people here to serve the
[03:25:12.660 --> 03:25:16.580]  creation much less to worship the creation but this is the kind of
[03:25:16.580 --> 03:25:20.740]  ideology among these UN people and religious people that think we all need
[03:25:20.740 --> 03:25:24.780]  to come on board with saving Mother Earth and ultimately worshiping the
[03:25:24.780 --> 03:25:30.420]  creation rather than the creator I can't even imagine the amount of darkness
[03:25:30.420 --> 03:25:35.660]  that was there I can't even imagine what you were feeling when you were there
[03:25:35.660 --> 03:25:40.580]  it's so thick Kate you can cut it with a knife you know you can't explain it to
[03:25:40.580 --> 03:25:44.540]  somebody who hasn't experienced it like you just feel it's so oppressive it's
[03:25:44.540 --> 03:25:48.180]  dark you know it's wicked and you know a lot of these people are true believers
[03:25:48.180 --> 03:25:51.380]  they're quite literally drinking the Kool-Aid right I mean they are fully on
[03:25:51.380 --> 03:25:55.220]  board and they think that yeah we need to start you know bowing down to the
[03:25:55.220 --> 03:25:59.740]  creation and saving Mother Earth by enslaving human beings and putting the
[03:25:59.740 --> 03:26:03.260]  UN in charge of basically every aspect of our lives they really believe this
[03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:07.980]  stuff and it's scary I think they are really being deluded they are under
[03:26:07.980 --> 03:26:12.860]  this mass delusion but you know what's really ironic Kate is that the cult
[03:26:12.860 --> 03:26:16.500]  leaders themselves you know they don't believe this stuff right and you can
[03:26:16.500 --> 03:26:21.100]  prove this very simply if they truly believe that carbon dioxide was this
[03:26:21.100 --> 03:26:24.460]  dangerous toxic pollution which of course that's the gas we exhale CO2
[03:26:24.460 --> 03:26:28.620]  emissions from human beings is like less than 1% of all the greenhouse gases in
[03:26:28.620 --> 03:26:31.280]  the atmosphere but if they really believe that this was going to destroy the
[03:26:31.280 --> 03:26:35.100]  planet the last thing in the world they would want to do is shut down American
[03:26:35.100 --> 03:26:38.460]  industry shut down European industry and ship all our jobs ship all our
[03:26:38.460 --> 03:26:43.020]  manufacturing over to China China already emits like 300% of all the CO2 that
[03:26:43.020 --> 03:26:46.980]  the way all the Western world combined emits a unit of economic production in
[03:26:46.980 --> 03:26:51.340]  China emits drastically more CO2 than that same unit of economic production in
[03:26:51.340 --> 03:26:54.580]  the United States and yet all these clowns are celebrating and toasting
[03:26:54.580 --> 03:26:57.500]  because they're shutting down our industry shutting down our factories and
[03:26:57.500 --> 03:27:01.300]  moving them to China it's how you know that they don't believe this lie
[03:27:01.300 --> 03:27:06.860]  themselves that really underpins this entire fraud case as they flew all their
[03:27:06.860 --> 03:27:15.380]  jets in yeah yeah they're throwing Greta to the curb and now they have sexy
[03:27:15.380 --> 03:27:20.900]  Sophia the millennial to sell this messaging to us you know I you know Greta
[03:27:20.900 --> 03:27:24.700]  and her little IU you know you're ruining my childhood and so it's really
[03:27:24.700 --> 03:27:27.940]  amazing what they're putting out there but what they're putting out there is
[03:27:27.940 --> 03:27:31.620]  truly who they are so believe every second of it because this is there they
[03:27:31.620 --> 03:27:36.460]  have no problem showing us and and I I'm not gonna I hope people don't put
[03:27:36.460 --> 03:27:39.340]  their heads in the sand anymore on this and I hope they realize what we're up
[03:27:39.340 --> 03:27:44.300]  against if you have the audacity to form a new 10 commandments and want to go to
[03:27:44.300 --> 03:27:48.220]  Maldesai night not just rules for your convention but 10 new commandments we
[03:27:48.220 --> 03:27:53.620]  have a problem don't we how we really do Kate and and when you really boil it
[03:27:53.620 --> 03:27:57.380]  down their their moral system and you know again the UN development program
[03:27:57.380 --> 03:28:00.820]  put out a major report right ahead of the conference as a preparation for it
[03:28:00.820 --> 03:28:04.900]  saying that the ethical and moral system that evolved with mankind is no longer
[03:28:04.900 --> 03:28:08.740]  adequate to you know saving the planet so they actually said in plain English we
[03:28:08.740 --> 03:28:13.900]  need a new moral code to live by and you know when you look at the essence of
[03:28:13.900 --> 03:28:17.660]  this moral code it really is a total inversion of the real moral code that
[03:28:17.660 --> 03:28:21.540]  God delivered to mankind through Moses at Sinai etc. right they regard
[03:28:21.540 --> 03:28:26.020]  population control and abortions and and you know lowering the population of
[03:28:26.020 --> 03:28:29.620]  people on the planet as a godly thing to do because it saves Mother Earth they
[03:28:29.620 --> 03:28:32.860]  want to undermine our private property rights and take our wealth which of
[03:28:32.860 --> 03:28:37.300]  course God said don't shout not steal is really a total inversion of true
[03:28:37.300 --> 03:28:41.780]  morality and yet they are you know peddled of the metal as fast as we can
[03:28:41.780 --> 03:28:45.940]  let's take away people's freedom and we got to watch out this is incredibly
[03:28:45.940 --> 03:28:50.580]  significant Alex Newman thank you for joining me go to the new American for

[03:30:13.980 --> 03:30:19.380]  the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible it made any resistance to
[03:30:19.380 --> 03:30:24.380]  it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive
[03:30:24.380 --> 03:30:28.940]  lawfare being waged against info wars despite the media defamatory libelist

[03:33:15.580 --> 03:33:20.020]  deli radio comm big thank you to Alex Newman my next guest I had to bring her
[03:33:20.020 --> 03:33:26.740]  to you today because her information is so fascinating so helpful and so
[03:33:26.740 --> 03:33:31.060]  mind-blowing really in fact we've been doing a lot of work on and I've been
[03:33:31.060 --> 03:33:35.340]  exposing a lot on so many things with the medical cabal right we're hearing
[03:33:35.340 --> 03:33:38.700]  about this a lot and in the wake of the last three years the one good thing
[03:33:38.700 --> 03:33:45.540]  that's come out of this if there is a good thing is that we we are now
[03:33:45.540 --> 03:33:49.780]  realizing what a cabal it truly is right and it never fought the social
[03:33:49.780 --> 03:33:56.660]  socialization of it and and what a what a horrid organization it now is in our
[03:33:56.660 --> 03:34:02.060]  lives well so many of us are are in illnesses that only came about from you
[03:34:02.060 --> 03:34:06.860]  know the last few decades and so many of us are suffering Pam Bartha is my guest

[03:34:22.300 --> 03:34:28.900]  so honored to be on your program well you know Alex's program exposes a lot of
[03:34:28.900 --> 03:34:33.300]  truth and I'm happy about that and happy to share you because you talk about
[03:34:33.300 --> 03:34:40.180]  parasites you were diagnosed with MS really early on in your 20s and you went
[03:34:40.180 --> 03:34:45.060]  on a discovery on a journey to find what was wrong talk to us about parasites
[03:34:45.060 --> 03:34:50.620]  because I don't think people realize how crucial this information is right so I
[03:34:50.620 --> 03:34:55.180]  was 28 years old and I thought it was a really healthy young mom never been sick
[03:34:55.180 --> 03:34:58.900]  in my life just had regular checkups with your doctor I was raising a young
[03:34:58.900 --> 03:35:02.980]  family and then one day I started to lose all the vision in my left eye and
[03:35:02.980 --> 03:35:07.100]  within three days it was like I had a black patch on my eye because it was
[03:35:07.100 --> 03:35:12.180]  such a severe case of optic neuritis I was rushed to the University MS Hospital
[03:35:12.180 --> 03:35:16.940]  Clinic the best in Canada on the West Coast and there they diagnosed me with
[03:35:16.940 --> 03:35:21.140]  multiple sclerosis and I didn't even know what it was we didn't have any family
[03:35:21.140 --> 03:35:24.620]  members and so you think you're so healthy and then all of a sudden one
[03:35:24.620 --> 03:35:28.580]  minute you are in the next minute you're not and that led me on this journey
[03:35:28.580 --> 03:35:32.780]  that's where it started and at first I was told by the experts there was no
[03:35:32.780 --> 03:35:37.420]  hope for me that I would be completely disabled in time that they didn't know
[03:35:37.420 --> 03:35:41.780]  what caused multiple sclerosis this was 34 years ago and today they still are
[03:35:41.780 --> 03:35:48.300]  no closer to knowing what causes MS and there is no cure so long story short my
[03:35:48.300 --> 03:35:51.060]  mother-in-law gave me a book on integrative health there were actually
[03:35:51.060 --> 03:35:57.740]  doctors over 34 years ago a few of them that wrote books about how parasites in
[03:35:57.740 --> 03:36:01.740]  the body can cause all chronic disease not just multiple sclerosis so that
[03:36:01.740 --> 03:36:06.620]  started my journey because I had never heard about that and just to be clear
[03:36:06.620 --> 03:36:11.460]  with parasites it's not just worms it can be different types of fungi it can be
[03:36:11.460 --> 03:36:15.900]  different types of protists and different disease-causing bacteria and of
[03:36:15.900 --> 03:36:22.940]  course worms big and small so to 34 years of research and journey we learned
[03:36:22.940 --> 03:36:27.300]  about Candida years ago many of your listeners probably know about Candida
[03:36:27.300 --> 03:36:31.740]  then we learned about the Lyme infections definitely chronic Lyme infections
[03:36:31.740 --> 03:36:36.240]  being part of chronic disease and more recently we've discovered that there
[03:36:36.240 --> 03:36:41.440]  are many other parasites like different sizes of worms there's research with
[03:36:41.440 --> 03:36:46.140]  multiple sclerosis that they're finding little roundworms in the spinal fluid of
[03:36:46.140 --> 03:36:52.260]  every MS patient that one pathologist studied and he also found developing
[03:36:52.260 --> 03:36:57.460]  tapeworms in the central nervous system of MS patients so the really good
[03:36:57.460 --> 03:37:01.460]  research and there's not a lot of it but the good research is showing that we
[03:37:01.460 --> 03:37:07.940]  have dysbiosis the sicker we are the more out of balance we are and infested so
[03:37:07.940 --> 03:37:13.580]  those of us that have MS, PLS, Parkinson's all of those horrible chronic
[03:37:13.580 --> 03:37:18.860]  diseases we're infested we're kind of late-stage and so you can't just treat
[03:37:18.860 --> 03:37:23.500]  one parasite you have to use a holistic approach and you have to treat the
[03:37:23.500 --> 03:37:27.940]  parasites and as you mentioned our healthcare system a long time ago
[03:37:27.940 --> 03:37:32.220]  decided not to treat parasites they decided there's a lot more money in
[03:37:32.220 --> 03:37:36.380]  immunosuppressive drugs to suppress our immune system to keep us on these
[03:37:36.380 --> 03:37:40.700]  drugs forever so this is the world that I've been living in for many years in
[03:37:40.700 --> 03:37:46.620]  understanding just you've been helping people all over the world and we're
[03:37:46.620 --> 03:37:51.220]  talking cancer Dr. Lee Merritt has talked about this lately too and so many
[03:37:51.220 --> 03:37:56.620]  diseases that sort of attack and there's no they say there's no cure to them they
[03:37:56.620 --> 03:37:59.460]  don't know what to do for all these endless decades here we are in the year
[03:37:59.460 --> 03:38:03.980]  2022 and they still don't know it's such a big mystery we all have parasites in
[03:38:03.980 --> 03:38:07.740]  us all different kinds of parasites from what we eat and everything else that
[03:38:07.740 --> 03:38:12.860]  that that is coming at us and other countries they do cleansings of
[03:38:12.860 --> 03:38:18.380]  parasites and we even deworm our dogs right you know once twice a year but
[03:38:18.380 --> 03:38:22.300]  we're never taught to do this we don't even think about this and the doctors if
[03:38:22.300 --> 03:38:25.820]  you mentioned this to doctors they have a blank face it's like they don't know
[03:38:25.820 --> 03:38:31.500]  even what to say about it other than to just dismiss it it's insane that's right
[03:38:31.500 --> 03:38:36.860]  so we're stuck in a situation where our practitioners even integrative they're
[03:38:36.860 --> 03:38:41.220]  not really skilled at recognizing identifying they don't have good tests
[03:38:41.220 --> 03:38:45.180]  all of them are told that you have to go to an underdeveloped country to get a
[03:38:45.180 --> 03:38:49.100]  parasite but they're all around us they're in our soil they're on the produce
[03:38:49.100 --> 03:38:53.580]  that comes there in our pets they're like past from person to person even
[03:38:53.580 --> 03:38:57.420]  eating in a restaurant if somebody's preparing your food like you can't avoid
[03:38:57.420 --> 03:39:01.020]  them you have to learn how to live with them and if you are sick you have to
[03:39:01.020 --> 03:39:06.180]  restore balance and that's how you can recover from chronic disease and not have
[03:39:06.180 --> 03:39:11.300]  to live on these horrible immunosuppressive drugs right you help
[03:39:11.300 --> 03:39:15.180]  people at lived is live disease free calm and I want to keep giving that out
[03:39:15.180 --> 03:39:19.060]  because I want people to get help and I want them to think hey you know this
[03:39:19.060 --> 03:39:24.380]  might be something that they need to do either it affects so much we didn't have
[03:39:24.380 --> 03:39:28.780]  chronic fatigue before we had the vaccine program we didn't have all of these
[03:39:28.780 --> 03:39:33.260]  these diseases that suddenly cropped up in the 1950s and onward and all this
[03:39:33.260 --> 03:39:38.740]  autoimmune going on and your feeling is that parasites there there are many
[03:39:38.740 --> 03:39:44.860]  parasites that can be behind this right yes there's many different thousands of
[03:39:44.860 --> 03:39:49.700]  different types of parasites that can be involved in chronic disease so it really
[03:39:49.700 --> 03:39:54.700]  depends when we lost our natural defense so many of us including myself we were
[03:39:54.700 --> 03:39:59.860]  on a lot of antibiotics they they can save lives absolutely but the overuse of
[03:39:59.860 --> 03:40:04.020]  antibiotics is probably the single greatest factor that really disrupts
[03:40:04.020 --> 03:40:09.380]  our ecosystem inside of us that health promoting microbes that protect us that
[03:40:09.380 --> 03:40:14.180]  act as our natural defense then we are susceptible to whatever parasites are in
[03:40:14.180 --> 03:40:18.700]  our environment and we don't know that this is happening and so then we just
[03:40:18.700 --> 03:40:22.540]  carry on with our life and we have high stress and we eat lots of carbs and so
[03:40:22.540 --> 03:40:28.380]  many environmental factors bring us to the place of chronic disease and we
[03:40:28.380 --> 03:40:31.900]  have a horrible diet we're over here in America where they don't ever talk about
[03:40:31.900 --> 03:40:36.300]  this this has never even mentioned at your nearest hospital right that you
[03:40:36.300 --> 03:40:39.700]  might have parasites that are causing these things parasites in the brain
[03:40:39.700 --> 03:40:43.740]  parasites all over and there's all different ways to cleanse different
[03:40:43.740 --> 03:40:47.420]  parasites too but they don't offer this up so I'm thinking about the American
[03:40:47.420 --> 03:40:51.340]  diet I'm thinking about how unhealthy and really fat we are right because
[03:40:51.340 --> 03:40:56.180]  everybody's fat and I'm thinking this is we're never going to look at the truth
[03:40:56.180 --> 03:41:00.260]  of really what's going on in our in our bodies and be able to heal what's
[03:41:00.260 --> 03:41:04.020]  happening what we're doing is we're suffering we're going in for chemo to
[03:41:04.020 --> 03:41:08.260]  annihilate our body even more right and we're buying into pharma pharma pharma
[03:41:08.260 --> 03:41:13.980]  and it's a very deceptive industry because they want a lifelong client and
[03:41:13.980 --> 03:41:18.220]  we are certainly serving that up cancer went from one in three to two to one in
[03:41:18.220 --> 03:41:23.780]  two now we are not going in the right direction and if vaccines were helpful
[03:41:23.780 --> 03:41:27.140]  and all these things were helpful we would have been we would have been going
[03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:29.940]  in a great direction we're not there's solid proof of that and I've talked
[03:41:29.940 --> 03:41:34.420]  about that a lot on this show but this is huge this is interesting if you're
[03:41:34.420 --> 03:41:38.460]  suffering from these things I would get some help from Pam and I would I would
[03:41:38.460 --> 03:41:43.700]  look into the parasites because there's so much that they can do with the kinds
[03:41:43.700 --> 03:41:48.060]  of parasites and that's what you've been working with for years with people
[03:41:48.060 --> 03:41:51.660]  is to try to help them understand the kinds of parasites they're dealing with
[03:41:51.660 --> 03:41:57.420]  and we don't realize there's thousands of them right in our bodies yes they and
[03:41:57.420 --> 03:42:02.940]  some parasites like to live in different parts of the body so we can't just start
[03:42:02.940 --> 03:42:07.980]  treating them we first support the body we first want to be feeling better and
[03:42:07.980 --> 03:42:11.700]  diet as you mentioned really important like the North American diet is so high
[03:42:11.700 --> 03:42:16.540]  in processed carbs and that is their favorite food that that is what it's
[03:42:16.540 --> 03:42:20.540]  like putting gas on a fire and that's what causes our symptoms and we're you
[03:42:20.540 --> 03:42:23.620]  know going into the holidays right now and so people are going to be loading up
[03:42:23.620 --> 03:42:27.780]  on sugar and sweets and and then they feel so horrible after and they don't
[03:42:27.780 --> 03:42:33.940]  know why and sickly everybody's getting sick and they wonder why and everybody
[03:42:33.940 --> 03:42:37.540]  thinks they're catching something I disagree I think that this is one of our
[03:42:37.540 --> 03:42:41.020]  biggest issues and we don't even realize it if we're gonna go deworm our dogs
[03:42:41.020 --> 03:42:45.260]  why don't we deworm ourselves my gosh it's like insanity once you start thinking
[03:42:45.260 --> 03:42:49.100]  about it I'm going to come right back with the great Pam Bartha from live

[03:43:59.380 --> 03:44:03.500]  basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[03:44:03.500 --> 03:44:07.700]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[03:44:07.700 --> 03:44:11.020]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[03:44:11.020 --> 03:44:14.940]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[03:44:14.940 --> 03:44:17.980]  with that you have you know with a deep burden source you know and I got really
[03:44:17.980 --> 03:44:22.660]  excited about that so I took it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to
[03:44:22.660 --> 03:44:27.020]  like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again
[03:44:27.020 --> 03:44:31.260]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of

[03:47:22.780 --> 03:47:27.180]  topics today because let me tell you this topic is huge the great pam bartha
[03:47:27.180 --> 03:47:32.060]  joins me from live disease free dot com where you can go get some help with this
[03:47:32.060 --> 03:47:35.740]  because she's a she's a really caring person and I love this because if
[03:47:35.740 --> 03:47:40.980]  there's anything that has come out of of 2020 and the big covid below vid lie is
[03:47:40.980 --> 03:47:45.700]  the fact that they're showing themselves right there we get to see now
[03:47:45.700 --> 03:47:51.940]  firsthand the lying and so I hope that drives people to the truth even more than
[03:47:51.940 --> 03:47:56.740]  it ever has before so that might be the the great thing that comes out of the
[03:47:56.740 --> 03:48:00.540]  last three years is finally understanding how much has been suppressed
[03:48:00.540 --> 03:48:05.340]  there have been medications I'm suppressed for cancer all kinds of things
[03:48:05.340 --> 03:48:09.220]  going on and there are things that you wouldn't be able to say anywhere else
[03:48:09.220 --> 03:48:13.900]  right Pam I mean because there are many forums that I think wouldn't even have
[03:48:13.900 --> 03:48:18.340]  you or let you say these these things that have been suppressed you can say
[03:48:18.340 --> 03:48:24.500]  them here though and I love that so talk to me about that and I just really
[03:48:24.500 --> 03:48:28.020]  want to thank you so much Kate for helping you're such a truth tolerant so
[03:48:28.020 --> 03:48:33.700]  is Alex and info or your whole team and I appreciate it so much because there
[03:48:33.700 --> 03:48:38.340]  has been such great suppression to keep this information from the general public
[03:48:38.340 --> 03:48:42.780]  to keep this information from our practitioners and it's time it's time
[03:48:42.780 --> 03:48:47.380]  that we need to bring this out there is so much suffering going on we cannot
[03:48:47.380 --> 03:48:52.020]  financially sustain our health care systems we don't want our current health
[03:48:52.020 --> 03:48:56.900]  care systems we need holistic approach we need to treat the cause we need to
[03:48:56.900 --> 03:49:00.780]  allow people to get their health and their life back because health care is
[03:49:00.780 --> 03:49:05.220]  actually quite simple it is not as complicated as the system that we have
[03:49:05.220 --> 03:49:11.260]  in place right now so true so true and there have been the suppression of
[03:49:11.260 --> 03:49:14.460]  things we have noticed that through the years all you got to do is a little
[03:49:14.460 --> 03:49:19.500]  research it's really easy to find there are many many things that that the
[03:49:19.500 --> 03:49:23.580]  minute they were understood boy those people were run out of the country and
[03:49:23.580 --> 03:49:29.060]  one in fact to Brazil I wish we could be a little more Brazil right now with
[03:49:29.060 --> 03:49:32.900]  everything going on but I'm looking at our whole medical institution and this
[03:49:32.900 --> 03:49:38.060]  cabal everything's coming from the NIH so when you go in and you say hey could
[03:49:38.060 --> 03:49:42.740]  it be a parasite could it be this I'm I've talked about poisoning on the show
[03:49:42.740 --> 03:49:45.580]  I've talked about chemical poisoning I've talked about all kinds of things
[03:49:45.580 --> 03:49:49.020]  things that it can actually be seen under a microscope and this is one of
[03:49:49.020 --> 03:49:53.180]  them you have a lot of parasites in your system and some more active than
[03:49:53.180 --> 03:49:58.020]  others and some on an active journey to destroy you right and so you see these
[03:49:58.020 --> 03:50:03.860]  chronic diseases become more and more debilitating and why do we not think
[03:50:03.860 --> 03:50:09.420]  that that could be a parasite and maybe maybe even you know addressed as a
[03:50:09.420 --> 03:50:13.740]  parasite and actually do that it couldn't hurt us and so it's it's
[03:50:13.740 --> 03:50:17.340]  interesting when people finally find this information isn't it Pam it's like
[03:50:17.340 --> 03:50:23.260]  being set free it just a light bulb goes off and they're like oh my gosh finally
[03:50:23.260 --> 03:50:28.220]  this makes so much sense and this affects everything it in fact affects
[03:50:28.220 --> 03:50:35.260]  infertility it affects mental health it affects migraines it affects like even
[03:50:35.260 --> 03:50:40.060]  weight gain and obesity and just living at our ideal weight it it affects every
[03:50:40.060 --> 03:50:45.340]  aspect of our health in different ways depending on which parasites we have how
[03:50:45.340 --> 03:50:51.900]  out of balance we are absolutely we you know we accept things you brought up on
[03:50:51.900 --> 03:50:55.140]  when we talked before you brought up menopause and you brought up all these
[03:50:55.140 --> 03:50:59.540]  things and we accept the suffering that goes along with it and you said you know
[03:50:59.540 --> 03:51:03.540]  we accept suffering that I don't think we have to accept there could be other
[03:51:03.540 --> 03:51:08.460]  answers and so when people treat these things when they when they go after the
[03:51:08.460 --> 03:51:12.780]  actual parasites causing it they are not a mystery and this is why this
[03:51:12.780 --> 03:51:17.180]  information is so vital today for so many listening because I don't think they
[03:51:17.180 --> 03:51:21.980]  think about it I don't think most people do I didn't think about this and could
[03:51:21.980 --> 03:51:25.220]  it be that parasite that's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and invading
[03:51:25.220 --> 03:51:29.820]  invading invading and that is why you have this degenerative process for years
[03:51:29.820 --> 03:51:34.780]  and years and years that becomes worse with absolutely no answers but we accept
[03:51:34.780 --> 03:51:40.860]  suffering we don't have to accept a lot that's absolutely true our body is a
[03:51:40.860 --> 03:51:46.060]  miracle it it's so it knows genetically how to operate and all we have to do is
[03:51:46.060 --> 03:51:50.060]  support it in very simple ways make sure we're getting enough nutrition and
[03:51:50.060 --> 03:51:54.460]  living a healthy lifestyle but the one piece that's really missing for most
[03:51:54.460 --> 03:51:58.700]  people is how to correct the microbes that live in their body how to restore
[03:51:58.700 --> 03:52:03.100]  balance and that's really the key that really helps us and you actually have
[03:52:03.100 --> 03:52:07.260]  to treat these parasites they don't go away they love living in our body if we
[03:52:07.260 --> 03:52:11.420]  end up with them because it's warm moist lots of food and so it's perfect
[03:52:11.420 --> 03:52:16.380]  grounds for them to grow and thrive and so we actually have to do a little bit of
[03:52:16.380 --> 03:52:21.740]  work at knocking them back bringing back the good microbes and then managing that
[03:52:21.740 --> 03:52:27.420]  and that's I've been able to live 34 years MS free that's amazing really and
[03:52:27.420 --> 03:52:32.620]  truly I I hope people are stopped in their tracks by that and how long does it
[03:52:32.620 --> 03:52:37.860]  take to cleanse how long does it take for that process it depends on the person
[03:52:37.860 --> 03:52:42.620]  if somebody is pretty healthy and they have gut issues it might be that three
[03:52:42.620 --> 03:52:47.020]  months and they're also treating three to six months and they're they've
[03:52:47.020 --> 03:52:51.500]  restored enough balance again we can't sterilize ourselves from these parasites
[03:52:51.500 --> 03:52:57.060]  but we reduce them enough in our body so that we are symptom free and we have a
[03:52:57.060 --> 03:53:00.740]  lot of energy and we have a lot of vitality for somebody who's been in a
[03:53:00.740 --> 03:53:06.820]  wheelchair for 30 years or 20 years like I can never promise full recovery but
[03:53:06.820 --> 03:53:11.060]  sometimes after a year of treating they're starting to come out of their
[03:53:11.060 --> 03:53:14.820]  wheelchairs we've had a lot of people that have been able to come out of their
[03:53:14.820 --> 03:53:20.020]  wheelchairs no longer using scooters going back to work it's so incredibly
[03:53:20.020 --> 03:53:25.460]  exciting so I wish we could get more interest in studying this because and
[03:53:25.460 --> 03:53:29.900]  helping our practitioners to treat the parasites because there is so much
[03:53:29.900 --> 03:53:35.460]  recovery that we can have that we didn't know was possible that's such good
[03:53:35.460 --> 03:53:39.380]  news it really is and when you when you look at these things you know I know
[03:53:39.380 --> 03:53:43.580]  that a lot of people are saying Femme what is the drug Femme bends at all or they
[03:53:43.580 --> 03:53:47.220]  use this with animals but there's I think human versions too right but that
[03:53:47.220 --> 03:53:53.580]  only goes after one parasite right right people are desperate and there's
[03:53:53.580 --> 03:53:58.580]  forms where they're trying a couple of different parasite drugs and that is not
[03:53:58.580 --> 03:54:03.040]  a smart approach number one you have to use the right treatment for the
[03:54:03.040 --> 03:54:07.420]  parasites you have and you want to use an effective dose if you're using very
[03:54:07.420 --> 03:54:11.140]  minimal doses you can make these parasites resistant and then that
[03:54:11.140 --> 03:54:15.020]  treatment is no longer going to help you in the future and so you want to use
[03:54:15.020 --> 03:54:21.580]  them a short term and at the right dose and in a cycle so that as they're laying
[03:54:21.580 --> 03:54:26.460]  eggs some of these roundworms can lay a hundred thousand eggs in a day so you
[03:54:26.460 --> 03:54:32.460]  want to do this like yeah and and you need support because these are medical
[03:54:32.460 --> 03:54:36.500]  drugs like we found that we cannot recover well enough especially with
[03:54:36.500 --> 03:54:42.300]  chronic disease just using the herbs and so we use a holistic approach like all
[03:54:42.300 --> 03:54:46.980]  the lifestyle things important in diet but then we use antimicrobial herbs we
[03:54:46.980 --> 03:54:52.300]  use parasite drugs the ones we test well for and oxidizing agents like oxygen
[03:54:52.300 --> 03:54:57.860]  type therapies so those three things work really well together the things that
[03:54:57.860 --> 03:55:03.420]  you can see under a microscope on bacteria fungi parasites I'm and it's
[03:55:03.420 --> 03:55:07.700]  interesting to me that they shy away from those more and then just go after
[03:55:07.700 --> 03:55:12.580]  virus virus is invisible unless you mix it in a vat with disease in order to see
[03:55:12.580 --> 03:55:17.980]  it now tell me if that makes sense so but everything is a virus everything is a
[03:55:17.980 --> 03:55:24.060]  virus ever since Johns Hopkins took over our medical cabal that is the answer
[03:55:24.060 --> 03:55:28.020]  for everything and I do hope people rethink their health I hope they look
[03:55:28.020 --> 03:55:32.700]  for avenues like this I hope they go after parasites I hope that they are
[03:55:32.700 --> 03:55:37.620]  willing and open to investigate other options because I don't think it's
[03:55:37.620 --> 03:55:42.180]  right for the medical cabal to say well it's a big huge mystery and we have some
[03:55:42.180 --> 03:55:47.900]  drugs to address the suffering you'll even get more side effects and we can't
[03:55:47.900 --> 03:55:52.700]  cure you and you know that's it and we're in the year 2022 it makes no sense
[03:55:52.700 --> 03:55:57.740]  nothing has changed in 34 years we still don't know what causes all chronic
[03:55:57.740 --> 03:56:03.260]  disease there is still no cure and in just even in the MS world the newer
[03:56:03.260 --> 03:56:08.180]  drugs are like a hundred thousand dollars per year so we have these big
[03:56:08.180 --> 03:56:13.820]  medical industries where there is so much money involved and people are
[03:56:13.820 --> 03:56:19.940]  suffering so terribly it's got to stop it has to stop and that's why that's why
[03:56:19.940 --> 03:56:24.180]  I wanted to have you on today Pam because if we can get this information if we
[03:56:24.180 --> 03:56:27.340]  can understand a little bit more about our bodies and what's going on and what's
[03:56:27.340 --> 03:56:31.580]  causing these things it makes perfect sense to me all the stuff we digest all
[03:56:31.580 --> 03:56:36.060]  the things in those vials with those shots I mean come on we don't know what's
[03:56:36.060 --> 03:56:42.100]  really in it do we and so I can't imagine ponying ourselves up for more shots
[03:56:42.100 --> 03:56:46.020]  more flu shots all of these things and not really understanding what's in it
[03:56:46.020 --> 03:56:50.340]  even Dr. Judy Mike of us was warning that hey all regulations are off now they
[03:56:50.340 --> 03:56:54.700]  can put anything in it and if we can understand and address our health in a
[03:56:54.700 --> 03:56:59.180]  better way then this works for people and this information is vital live
[03:56:59.180 --> 03:57:06.660]  disease free comm is the website correct yes it is okay I love this Pam
[03:57:06.660 --> 03:57:11.580]  Bartha you're a warrior in health and I love my warriors in health because those
[03:57:11.580 --> 03:57:15.860]  are the people I trust you know I got my husband out of the hospital very very
[03:57:15.860 --> 03:57:19.820]  quickly after that third day you say no to experimental drugs like remdesivir
[03:57:19.820 --> 03:57:24.220]  you say no to their shots obviously that are causing what they're causing and we
[03:57:24.220 --> 03:57:29.220]  start looking for the actual issues and problems in our health Pam Bartha you
