[00:00.000 --> 00:17.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:17.440 --> 00:26.480]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:26.480 --> 00:34.480]  Thursday August 2nd 2018 I'm your host Alex Jones we're gonna be here for the
[00:34.480 --> 00:38.960]  next four hours in the war room with Owen Schroyer and Roger Stones coming up
[00:41.680 --> 00:44.240]  I need to make this announcement
[00:47.200 --> 00:49.920]  and I need to have it really really sink in
[00:49.920 --> 00:59.760]  it is not hyperbole it is not hype
[01:02.000 --> 01:03.600]  it is not exaggeration
[01:06.240 --> 01:14.640]  it is a historic completely documented fact and it is the most important issue
[01:14.640 --> 01:22.960]  to everyone on this planet that the council on foreign relations China
[01:22.960 --> 01:40.680]  century plan be exposed China has a leveraged controlling interest in money
[01:40.680 --> 01:49.320]  in manpower in infrastructure and in traders in our government and in
[01:49.320 --> 01:56.640]  corporations to control this nation China is in control of everything in
[01:56.640 --> 02:10.440]  America but the military some of the courts and the states it is a fact and
[02:10.440 --> 02:14.200]  I've been pointing this out and others like Tucker Carlson are starting to do
[02:14.200 --> 02:20.280]  it so was the president but I'm going to tell you things that the president can't
[02:20.280 --> 02:28.680]  tell you at his level or it would have some very very dangerous consequences but I think
[02:28.680 --> 02:33.720]  the consequences of the president not doing this and not saying this are too great
[02:33.720 --> 02:42.200]  and the main reason they want to destroy me out of all of it is that no one else is putting out
[02:42.200 --> 02:50.040]  the real globalist agenda I want to explain something this is a wedding between the big
[02:50.040 --> 03:01.240]  mega banks Goldman Sachs JP Morgan the EU the whole Hollywood combine that the Rockefellers
[03:01.240 --> 03:05.720]  set up and wrote books about and and and editorials of the New York Times
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.520]  the traders needed a big industrial power and they needed a focused autocratic fascist system
[03:14.520 --> 03:24.840]  that they call communist that they could interface with China in its official
[03:24.840 --> 03:32.920]  military doctrine says they are in economic war with us that they're dismantling us from
[03:32.920 --> 03:38.520]  without and from within and they've had Davos meetings last year not this year where the
[03:38.520 --> 03:43.880]  Chinese dictator came they've made him officially a dictator now he was always selected by the
[03:43.880 --> 03:49.480]  party but now he is they made him dictator for life along with his vice president that hasn't
[03:49.480 --> 03:59.480]  happened since Mao because they're in a war posture so we are at war with China
[04:01.240 --> 04:06.200]  and it shakes me to my core how brainwashed many of our fellow countrymen and women are and
[04:06.200 --> 04:11.160]  how they believe globalist propaganda and that even fox news is viciously attacking me and
[04:11.160 --> 04:15.480]  lying about me but never showing what I really supposedly said trying to juxtapose me against
[04:15.480 --> 04:21.320]  families and children classic globalist tactic when China is selling political dissidents organs
[04:22.840 --> 04:25.560]  when China has taken over the major universities everything here
[04:28.600 --> 04:32.840]  and they are implementing the censorship and I told you Google is moving to China
[04:33.400 --> 04:38.120]  and their own leaked documents don't just say from one of the top engineers at Google
[04:38.120 --> 04:41.480]  only only at 200 people at Google out of 80 something thousand knew this
[04:41.480 --> 04:48.200]  operation dragonfly they've already implemented dragonfly we have the other internal documents
[04:48.200 --> 04:53.640]  that I've received they don't know the name of it but they're already phasing in the censorship
[04:53.640 --> 04:58.200]  incrementally right now here they're going global and China is the command base
[05:00.280 --> 05:06.120]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in
[05:06.120 --> 05:11.480]  leilanias states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
[05:11.480 --> 05:18.600]  about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[05:18.600 --> 05:25.320]  the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[05:25.320 --> 05:31.320]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[05:31.320 --> 05:37.400]  acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and
[05:37.400 --> 05:43.480]  not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal
[05:43.480 --> 05:50.200]  levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what we've
[05:50.200 --> 05:56.680]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly
[05:56.680 --> 06:05.080]  a good water filtration system will purify it we are drugged out we are following other people's
[06:05.080 --> 06:14.120]  opinions we are controlled by the media today it all changes this reality has been forced upon us
[06:14.120 --> 06:19.480]  it is a choice just like what i said slavery is a choice istein says the depth of insanity is
[06:19.480 --> 06:24.040]  doing the same thing expecting a different result so we keep on saying i hate you i hate you
[06:24.040 --> 06:29.880]  you you how are we going to get a different result out of hate why don't we just try love
[06:29.880 --> 06:36.840]  why don't we just try love we have the resources for a peaceful world you know sometimes you need
[06:36.840 --> 06:42.920]  some crazy mother to change something steve jobs is crazy now we all know steve jobs phones they
[06:42.920 --> 06:49.080]  say trucks crazy they say i'm crazy but i'm here to show love it's a bigger plan and i'm just doing
[06:49.080 --> 06:58.360]  what the universe told me resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[07:06.040 --> 07:12.920]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[07:12.920 --> 07:33.800]  lines of the i'm going to say something here that i've said probably a thousand times last year
[07:33.800 --> 07:41.000]  but i'm going to lay it out be crystal clear about it everything else is a side issue
[07:41.000 --> 07:47.800]  everything else is the fallout of the global government
[07:49.400 --> 07:51.640]  plan the agenda developed
[07:54.360 --> 08:00.760]  by the multinational globalist combine which was a development of cesil roads
[08:00.760 --> 08:11.160]  roads british intelligence and the british empire phased into pratt house council on farm relations
[08:11.160 --> 08:23.400]  1922 when the british empire was made subservient and folded into a new u.s empire plan now
[08:23.400 --> 08:31.400]  Winston Churchill wrote books about this countless others have documented it that's what happened
[08:32.440 --> 08:39.800]  that's mainline phd level understanding of the us uh there was a whole anglophile movement where
[08:39.800 --> 08:43.640]  we started having british tea cups and celebrating the queen that was the deal that's why you see
[08:43.640 --> 08:48.600]  tabloids everywhere and you know they made it popularize the love of the queen again and all of that
[08:48.600 --> 08:56.120]  was because of that alliance that came during world war one and then after you have to understand
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.600]  though that's the elites that controlled the uk and used it for their global empire not the british
[09:00.600 --> 09:06.840]  people so it's not a british conspiracy it's not a german conspiracy even though the royal families
[09:06.840 --> 09:15.080]  german the house of winsor with king george the first replaced the previous norman kings who
[09:15.080 --> 09:27.640]  who were viking basically and then they were replaced of course by the transylvanians came in
[09:27.640 --> 09:31.640]  through germany but that's a whole other issue that's just the back story
[09:36.520 --> 09:41.560]  that the people that run the british empire transylvanians you know like wow funny is that
[09:41.560 --> 09:49.400]  is that a fact yeah look it up that's why rom stoker's dracula is all putting history in there
[09:51.160 --> 09:52.280]  hiding in plain view
[09:54.920 --> 09:59.640]  and and now we hear about the british royal family and all the people that disappear and the
[09:59.640 --> 10:05.880]  pedophilia and the blood drinking and the blood transfusions and all the rest of it but i'm digressing
[10:05.880 --> 10:14.840]  and they had cousins that were the czars who themselves had a german hungarian austrian
[10:14.840 --> 10:26.840]  hungarian background and they went in in 1917 1918 had the bolster revolution british intelligence
[10:26.840 --> 10:33.080]  with with with us funding and former russian immigrants that came to the us jewish immigrants
[10:33.080 --> 10:38.840]  that came into the us russian jewish immigrants is all history books again went in in 1917 1918
[10:38.840 --> 10:43.880]  at the end of world war one when russia was weakened took the czars out brought in bolshevism
[10:45.320 --> 10:52.760]  turned russia into a new giant engine of the multinational corporations to expand into areas
[10:52.760 --> 11:05.480]  and play the opposition to the german austrian hungarian empire that had fallen to some of
[11:05.480 --> 11:16.440]  their cousins but was still another competing group so the sachs cobert goth arm was taking out the
[11:16.440 --> 11:23.080]  czars world war one had been about also taking out their other cousins that were another group
[11:23.080 --> 11:29.080]  and the austrian hungarian empire with those three competing factions and the reason i've laid out
[11:29.080 --> 11:40.280]  those basics is russia was used as this engine of tyranny and and covert funding and and
[11:40.280 --> 11:47.080]  invasion around the world and exploitation but then the un and and the us and the british empire
[11:47.080 --> 11:53.080]  could then play the good cops in opposition and resisted and the fighting and the wars and the
[11:53.080 --> 11:58.600]  stuff that went on at many levels was real but at the top it was being coordinated and manipulated
[11:58.600 --> 12:10.200]  now the the russians after world war two had some different coup d'etats and things and
[12:12.040 --> 12:18.440]  were able to get partial control back over their country but they were still following a soviet
[12:18.440 --> 12:26.520]  communist system and so then the cold war became even more real for a while and then the old
[12:26.520 --> 12:34.520]  soviet union finally fell apart but by then the plan of the rockefellers in the 40s to put
[12:34.520 --> 12:40.040]  mouse a tongue in the communist in charge of china and their dream of organizing the chinese that are
[12:40.040 --> 12:46.600]  smart and hardworking industrializing them but having them be under communism and basically fascist
[12:46.600 --> 12:52.200]  controls what it is of the rich elites and then exploit the country just like they'd done russia
[12:52.200 --> 13:04.360]  to take over the rest of the planet and mainline universities again there are so many papers on
[13:04.360 --> 13:09.560]  this and they've they've declassified old soviet records from the 60s 70s 80s it's all true
[13:10.920 --> 13:16.760]  yeah there's a quote from david rockefeller uh in the new york times 1977 let's put that back
[13:16.760 --> 13:24.520]  up on screen the social experiment under chairman mao has been an incredible success you can read
[13:24.520 --> 13:29.080]  the whole editorial the social experiment in china under chairman mao's leadership is one of the most
[13:29.080 --> 13:35.720]  important and successful in human history now the reason i laid out that earlier gestalt quick
[13:35.720 --> 13:41.800]  five minute on empires and the factions is if you don't know who the factions are how are you ever
[13:41.800 --> 13:48.840]  going to know who you are or what faction you want to be with how are you going to do that
[13:50.680 --> 13:57.000]  that's a question i'm asking you right now because when i'm telling you is who the players are
[13:57.560 --> 14:00.920]  and we've been brought up with hollywood the media and all these different angles
[14:00.920 --> 14:05.000]  and people don't know what it is to be an american they don't know who the players were when our
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.240]  country got founded they don't understand how the spanish empire faded the portuguese empire
[14:11.240 --> 14:17.560]  faded uh how the french empire had faded and all there was was the british empire getting weaker
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.280]  so the japanese thought they could take that over in world war two and hitler thought they were
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.040]  weak he thought he could take them out as well and then they teamed up with the united states
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  and this whole anglophile movement rolled out where the first hollywood movies they spoke
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.880]  in english accents even they weren't english there was an attempt to actually civilize america again
[14:35.880 --> 14:40.360]  and have us re-merge with england i mean all this stuff got pushed and it's all been going on
[14:40.360 --> 14:47.400]  right underneath the surface and now since the 40s they put Mao Zedong in power and and moved
[14:47.400 --> 14:55.160]  everything to china as the final piece to leverage out europe the u.s canada england australia where
[14:55.160 --> 14:59.480]  nobody can compete they're given all the ports all the rare of minerals globally you're not even
[14:59.480 --> 15:04.680]  allowed to compete with the chinese it's all set up because no one can compete with a billion 400
[15:04.680 --> 15:09.800]  million slaves no one can compete with there's no daycare and you chain your kit up at a power
[15:09.800 --> 15:13.320]  pole and they get one a meal a day and they sit there and crap on the side of the road and you
[15:13.320 --> 15:17.640]  go in and work in an apple factory and there's suicide nets and they'll take you out the street
[15:17.640 --> 15:21.240]  and shoot you in the back of the head if you talk back and then over here we're you know teaching us
[15:21.240 --> 15:25.640]  how to be weak and how to fall apart and not have to work and you know we're telling five-year-olds
[15:25.640 --> 15:31.240]  that you're really a girl you're really a boy i mean that is all psychological warfare systems
[15:31.240 --> 15:38.360]  that that are illegal in china and so it's an admitted plan and now we already knew all this
[15:38.360 --> 15:44.200]  but now it's coming into view and what rockefeller dreamed of is happening but rockefeller dreamed
[15:44.200 --> 15:50.840]  of it's actually working but trump at the last minute like teleported in and we're desperately
[15:50.840 --> 15:55.880]  trying to turn this around because where they're leading us in the chinese century is hell on earth
[15:55.880 --> 16:01.080]  i'll tell you the rest of the plan when we come back if you like alkaline water or know someone

[18:12.040 --> 18:19.800]  clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in
[18:19.800 --> 18:25.720]  france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[18:25.720 --> 18:31.320]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have
[18:31.320 --> 18:36.920]  the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.920 --> 18:43.320]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[18:43.320 --> 18:48.440]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that
[18:48.440 --> 18:54.760]  amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[19:58.440 --> 20:16.120]  infowarslife.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:16.120 --> 20:29.560]  live from the infowars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show remember
[20:31.320 --> 20:38.440]  remember 22 years ago i made films i did hundreds of radio shows and i said
[20:38.440 --> 20:46.120]  all of your phones starting in 2000 will be tracked by chips triangulated by cell towers
[20:47.080 --> 20:52.520]  and everything you do will then be wired to the nsa create a total map of where you go what you do
[20:53.320 --> 21:00.360]  and absolutely be a little government minder that monitors every facet of your life and then
[21:00.360 --> 21:04.600]  in the future if you're not a good globalist they will start to turn the functions off on the phone
[21:04.600 --> 21:12.840]  you will have a global score on how valuable you are and who you are and how trusted you are
[21:13.560 --> 21:18.440]  and all these years later people go how did you predict it i didn't predict it i was told this
[21:18.440 --> 21:24.840]  by nsa whistleblowers and there was no one else that would report on at the time and they started
[21:24.840 --> 21:31.240]  having the military watch me i started having the cia come around but then something funny happened
[21:31.240 --> 21:36.360]  and people inside government who knew all about this stuff they were the ones that decided they
[21:36.360 --> 21:45.800]  don't like it so then the different foundations began to attack me saying jones is a government agent
[21:46.840 --> 21:50.360]  that's how he knows all this stuff and you can't trust it what does that even mean
[21:53.240 --> 22:00.520]  i'm here saying you need to trust yourself you need to trust god you need to trust common sense
[22:00.520 --> 22:04.120]  well now everybody knows i'm definitely not working for the new world order i'm not a government
[22:04.120 --> 22:11.800]  agent of any type because everybody knows they're trying to destroy me so just like we told you
[22:11.800 --> 22:16.280]  everything that was coming and it all happened just like we said and just like we told you
[22:16.280 --> 22:19.800]  there's a big private corporate world government and it was going to roll all this out against
[22:19.800 --> 22:25.720]  everybody and roll out the censorship it's all happening because it was planned the wiki leaks
[22:25.720 --> 22:30.280]  documented hillary clinton has been giving speeches since the middle of the campaign saying
[22:30.280 --> 22:36.040]  when i get elected we're gonna shut down alex jones in fake news and even though she didn't get
[22:36.040 --> 22:41.880]  elected they're moving forward with it with these headlines jones taken off spotify for hate speech
[22:43.320 --> 22:48.600]  jones taken off youtube for bullying a child they don't show where i did that jones taken off
[22:48.600 --> 22:53.160]  facebook and it's quote a slap on the wrist it's not it's to take the press and it's americans
[22:53.160 --> 22:57.560]  believe in you know three strikes or whatever it's like well he kept getting warned you know he
[22:57.560 --> 23:03.960]  didn't get censored he just got warned over and over again and so we had to digitally burn that book
[23:07.080 --> 23:11.080]  they're saying they don't want me to be able to publish information they don't mean to be able to
[23:11.080 --> 23:17.640]  talk they don't want me to be able to do anything and then they have thousands and thousands and
[23:17.640 --> 23:24.760]  thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of articles a day saying alex jones
[23:24.760 --> 23:29.320]  did this the sanny hook family alex jones did that never showing where i did any of it alex
[23:29.320 --> 23:34.360]  jones says parkland didn't happen never showing and then bill hemer gets concerned and all the rest
[23:34.360 --> 23:44.200]  of it and they lie to everyone and they do it over and over again to set the precedent to outlaw
[23:44.200 --> 23:51.240]  this information that communist china allied with the globalist allied with pratt house
[23:51.240 --> 23:57.480]  and the british empire plan have done a giant double cross of the entire west using china
[23:57.480 --> 24:04.440]  and exploiting its people to drive down global living standards and to consolidate total power
[24:04.440 --> 24:10.600]  and control and then let china get control of our debt the propaganda system of the united states
[24:10.600 --> 24:19.880]  hollywood our major universities and now the i cloud keys apple's officially based there google's
[24:19.880 --> 24:27.800]  there and now i can read sky news or the london guardian and it's exactly what i told you google
[24:27.800 --> 24:34.360]  whistleblower one of only 200 that had the secret uh plans for operation dragonfly already in place
[24:34.360 --> 24:39.160]  in china says the real danger is that similar systems are being built here in the us and around
[24:39.160 --> 24:48.520]  the world by google you actually read what the whistleblower told the intercept it's hiding in
[24:48.520 --> 24:54.200]  plain view what do you think google's doing in facebook when paul watson wrote an article
[24:54.200 --> 25:06.280]  off public un documents saying that the un wants 600 million migrants that's what the democrats are
[25:06.280 --> 25:12.840]  saying no borders at all that's what the democrats are saying shut down ice no borders no borders
[25:12.840 --> 25:17.000]  yeah we want illegal aliens to vote that's the globalist takeover and now they go from denying
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.960]  it to saying yes that's what we're going to do it's big corporations using the third world to
[25:21.960 --> 25:30.200]  take over and capture the west it's total domination and then they have politifact now funded by
[25:30.200 --> 25:35.560]  soros and others say paul watson is fake and put a thing over the browser where you can't share the
[25:35.560 --> 25:41.880]  article saying paul watson's fake when right there in his article he leaks to the you in website
[25:41.880 --> 25:47.560]  and i could play you them saying it and i could show macron saying it a month ago that they want
[25:47.560 --> 25:58.600]  200 million north africans to come in by 2035 the story's on info wars dot com fake news fail
[25:58.600 --> 26:07.240]  facebook flags accurate info war story citing you in docs this morning this morning i tweeted a short
[26:07.240 --> 26:19.080]  video where yesterday and today all over the news they say that i am seeking a hundred thousand
[26:19.080 --> 26:26.760]  dollars damages from the sandy hook parents that are selling me here in texas and that it's unprecedented
[26:26.760 --> 26:32.120]  and that i'm a horrible person and some of the articles say jones is beyond the scum of the earth
[26:32.120 --> 26:38.280]  we've got to find new terms for him and they all know that under state statute now when you
[26:38.280 --> 26:42.920]  sue somebody for defamation that kicks in that if you're wrong it's up to a hundred thousand
[26:42.920 --> 26:48.440]  dollars in attorneys fees at the judge's discretion and that defile with the statutes we you have to
[26:48.440 --> 26:54.680]  file your counter that statute comes in and that then at the first hearing if you want to you can
[26:54.680 --> 27:03.080]  waive the attorneys fees which is unprecedented and we did it in front of at least 30 members of
[27:03.080 --> 27:10.520]  the so-called media and how many people reported that alex jones waived attorneys fees and texas
[27:10.520 --> 27:15.480]  slap provision against the sandy hook parents as a high road gesture so i've been reaching out to them
[27:15.480 --> 27:23.080]  for years and and and they know that and they're ignoring it and going forward and we are now
[27:23.080 --> 27:34.840]  actually having to look at action but because it's true defamation to say we're sending people
[27:34.840 --> 27:39.880]  to people's houses to hurt them and then it's not true it's it's it's it's true defamation
[27:39.880 --> 27:44.840]  to to for the media to know that we took the mega high road and didn't even
[27:48.120 --> 27:51.800]  open it up we have a chance of getting the attorney fees back which when they lose they
[27:51.800 --> 27:58.440]  have to give you just up to the judge how much and the discipline of the corporate media is so
[27:58.440 --> 28:04.040]  incredible when it comes to lies that there are thousands of articles saying alex jones
[28:04.040 --> 28:08.760]  sued the sandy hook families which that's not even one it is they sued me and just like in
[28:08.760 --> 28:14.920]  england if you sue somebody for defamation and lose you got to pay texas passed a law like that
[28:14.920 --> 28:21.400]  that's the law they all and they were all waiting till the suit started knowing that would be triggered
[28:21.400 --> 28:27.480]  so they could technically be telling 10 of the truth that yes it does in a form of suit
[28:28.120 --> 28:33.400]  trigger back that if they lose it's up to the judge may make them pay attorney's fees so they
[28:33.400 --> 28:39.080]  call that me wanting a hundred thousand dollars and me suing them when i'm not so we already knew
[28:39.080 --> 28:44.520]  they were going to do that so the first thing at the hearing is mr jones is waving that and the
[28:44.520 --> 28:53.240]  media groaned and got angry and my lawyer said well we knew they'd do that that's a group of criminals
[28:53.800 --> 29:00.600]  okay murdering truth trained to hate america scum of the earth who has the only raw living whole

[34:08.040 --> 34:14.680]  liberal anti-white racist i mean that that's that's the operating system of the whole global
[34:14.680 --> 34:22.920]  program is anti-white that's how the big megabanks and china think that they're going to organize
[34:22.920 --> 34:28.040]  the third world into hating the west and actively sabotaging it and bringing it down and and
[34:28.040 --> 34:38.040]  cheering china is race-based politics chinese communists are cold blooded and i think people
[34:38.040 --> 34:40.840]  like her because we know how much they've infiltrated the media and they've infiltrated
[34:42.440 --> 34:47.560]  academia the chinese communist operatives all these people either they asian black white doesn't
[34:47.560 --> 34:52.920]  matter need to be investigated to see if they've got china ties that's why they keep saying russia
[34:52.920 --> 35:00.760]  russia russia russia because russia has almost no offensive intelligence operations now they're
[35:00.760 --> 35:04.600]  under siege they're under attack putin said that they've pulled back they've cut their military
[35:04.600 --> 35:09.480]  spending they've increased internal security spending because they are under globalist attack
[35:09.480 --> 35:14.760]  just like we are they've kicked more the globalist out than we have but they've got their own swamp
[35:14.760 --> 35:18.920]  and billions are spent each year by soros alone and the state department trying to topple them
[35:18.920 --> 35:26.680]  we're involved in their elections but it's not america doing it it's the globalist allied with china
[35:28.520 --> 35:32.600]  and i was reading the entire intercept article in the documents they got from a whistleblower
[35:32.600 --> 35:37.960]  last night i reread the whole article and just like dragonfly over there has these browsers
[35:37.960 --> 35:43.720]  that pop up just on regular things that are disputed that the chinese government wants to
[35:43.720 --> 35:48.920]  control but then it there's thousands of terms that are totally banned and then they can go on any time
[35:48.920 --> 35:54.920]  they want into the browser and and and make it where you can't search something and a big example
[35:54.920 --> 36:04.520]  of that was um what just happened uh on iphone's for two weeks about a week ago it ended the mo g
[36:04.520 --> 36:13.160]  of taiwan could not be sent by iphone's and not just in china that's the level of control you
[36:13.160 --> 36:20.120]  go choose the mo g and when it goes across the network it's recognized by the little back door
[36:20.120 --> 36:29.560]  software that apple controls and it turns your phone off and they admitted oh we've moved to china
[36:30.600 --> 36:33.160]  and they now run us and that's what they wanted to do
[36:36.680 --> 36:40.200]  and by the way when it first broke it was security researcher accuses apple of censoring
[36:40.200 --> 36:45.240]  taiwan flag in china no it happened and it was happening outside as well i mean they are now
[36:45.240 --> 36:51.720]  making airlines not call it that are outside of china american airlines you name it if they want
[36:51.720 --> 36:58.280]  to land in china you've got to take taiwan off your magazines off of your maps off of everything
[37:00.280 --> 37:05.800]  so i'm gonna stop right there what i'm saying is do you understand they're they're they're popularizing
[37:05.800 --> 37:14.600]  modern book burning which is digital burning of information by saying oh deplatform alex jones
[37:14.600 --> 37:21.640]  the morning joe america's newsroom all of them unified saying take alex jones off the air take
[37:21.640 --> 37:29.320]  him off the air he won't stop bullying sandy hook families he's doing it right now he's suing them
[37:29.320 --> 37:39.480]  none of it's true we got to protect the children we're the good people at fox we're the good people
[37:39.480 --> 37:48.600]  at cnn we're the good people uh at msnbc and alex is the batman we just lie you into wars and
[37:48.600 --> 37:54.600]  our anti-american and we just promoted the arab spring that was a big jihadi takeover and we're
[37:54.600 --> 38:00.520]  just promoting war with russia but alex jones when the public questioned a public event because of
[38:00.520 --> 38:05.960]  government's history of manipulating things said people have a right to question and then for years
[38:05.960 --> 38:10.280]  said okay i think it happened it doesn't matter because they'll never have me say that they'll
[38:10.280 --> 38:16.040]  never show it because they're going to lie about it on the news to again continue to demonize people
[38:16.040 --> 38:23.800]  that are telling the truth this is how you get americans organized to kill the first amendment
[38:26.040 --> 38:30.360]  it's how you get them to set the precedent of oh well we have a first amendment but not for alex
[38:30.360 --> 38:36.040]  jones and then oh all these congressmen suddenly can't tweet oh all these other people are suddenly
[38:36.040 --> 38:48.920]  being kicked off and censored oh oh google's coming out with a total censorship system with
[38:48.920 --> 38:53.800]  the communist chinese and then their own engineer that leaked info said and they're developing all
[38:53.800 --> 38:57.880]  of that here yes they've already implemented and broke their algorithm google doesn't work not just
[38:57.880 --> 39:03.560]  for my name but for most stuff it's fried because it doesn't work off an algorithm of what you
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.480]  actually search and do now and what's popular and what's helpful and what's rated it's run by
[39:07.480 --> 39:13.640]  what the central committee wants and that's all public and now the infrastructure is being totally
[39:13.640 --> 39:19.240]  moved there to run that operation from china and china has all your google codes all your apple
[39:19.240 --> 39:27.240]  codes everything and that's all even in roiders i'm gonna say it again apple is officially chinese
[39:27.240 --> 39:35.160]  state run now they pay no taxes they own slave factories they lease and run slave factories
[39:35.160 --> 39:40.120]  they have the worst factories in the world but they're liberal and give a hundred million dollars
[39:40.120 --> 39:45.720]  of black lives matter so it's okay oh look i like black people the police are evil and are killing
[39:45.720 --> 39:51.320]  them oh look 140 something black people got shot by you know police or whatever last year let's say
[39:51.320 --> 39:58.040]  it was all wrong okay is that the biggest issue in the world no it's done as a distractionary
[39:58.040 --> 40:06.680]  operation because tim cook is ruthless and wicked china is selling political dissidents organs
[40:07.320 --> 40:11.640]  google is officially helping them do it they had congressional hearings i'm going to read you some
[40:11.640 --> 40:16.520]  of the transcripts we had to pull it up from c-span when we come back from years ago when google was
[40:16.520 --> 40:20.600]  already working with the chinese and got caught there were huge scandals they called it treason
[40:20.600 --> 40:26.760]  in congress and they supposedly quit but now everyone's running back in and complying with
[40:26.760 --> 40:33.480]  the censorship and that's what trump's trying to change now you've got a choice to make as
[40:33.480 --> 40:37.320]  listeners and viewers and station owners and managers and people are sticking by us and
[40:37.320 --> 40:40.680]  standing up against the propaganda it really pisses the system off i want to thank you for your
[40:40.680 --> 40:47.800]  support but all of you need to seriously have a gut check time and understand that we are the tip
[40:47.800 --> 40:52.120]  of the spear we are under unprecedented attack and without you we're not going to be on the air

[47:09.800 --> 47:34.840]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[47:40.680 --> 47:47.960]  the president trump has come out and said that the mainstream media when they are
[47:47.960 --> 47:54.120]  lying about his agenda trying to sabotage eastfields the economy our enemies the american people
[47:54.120 --> 47:58.280]  when bill marr says he wants a depression to keep you know americans under their control that's
[47:58.280 --> 48:05.240]  that's that's called siege that is a form of total warfare one of the most ancient one of the most
[48:05.240 --> 48:14.040]  cruel one of the most effective everything you see out of hollywood is globalist chi com committee
[48:14.040 --> 48:24.520]  formed battle plans and when you see every major network and tv show in the country from movies to
[48:24.520 --> 48:31.560]  sitcoms to dramas to cartoons to mainstream news saying i'm a racist saying i'm a liar saying i
[48:31.560 --> 48:39.640]  hurt children that's at the highest levels those decisions were made those orders were given and
[48:39.640 --> 48:50.760]  they were implemented to the letter spit shine now that's how far down we are here's the good news
[48:51.720 --> 48:53.320]  it's only up from here as you can see
[48:55.880 --> 49:00.360]  because they've been artificially trying to suppress this country for decades and decades
[49:00.360 --> 49:08.120]  and now all that's still been blown apart and that's why they are so desperate to get me off
[49:08.120 --> 49:13.720]  of the air they cannot stand it because my instincts are just like the president's instincts
[49:13.720 --> 49:19.080]  and i come from a very similar background when it comes to how i was educated informed and then
[49:19.080 --> 49:24.440]  shown how the world worked i wasn't indoctrinated i was shown how it really worked
[49:24.440 --> 49:31.640]  shown history shown the combine shown the power structure shown how things really operate not
[49:31.640 --> 49:39.320]  not how they teach the sheeple to keep you at a subservient peon surf slave level
[49:41.240 --> 49:46.280]  so the president's been calling him the enemy he's been talking about china infiltrating
[49:46.280 --> 49:50.360]  china selling us out you're seeing news articles about how they've taken over major universities
[49:50.360 --> 49:53.960]  you're seeing articles about why do they have 98 percent of rare earth minerals uh
[49:53.960 --> 50:00.280]  you see articles now what china says we're at war with the u.s economically we're encircling them
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.640]  we're putting social pressure on their people you see nyu top professors saying
[50:05.640 --> 50:09.400]  they're mall brigades everywhere they said they're going to overthrow america i'm a liberal this is
[50:09.400 --> 50:13.400]  dangerous these people aren't liberals these are authoritarians danger danger
[50:13.400 --> 50:21.800]  how many professors have we had on like hamamoto they're at uh
[50:23.560 --> 50:28.920]  well the major universities in california they're in the meetings and he goes to the meetings and
[50:28.920 --> 50:33.160]  the left ish we are going to create a race consciousness for world government we're
[50:33.160 --> 50:37.160]  going to use whites as the catalyst we're going to teach everyone who isn't white they're bad
[50:37.160 --> 50:41.720]  because of demographic numbers we know the average human if they they're told to be tribal
[50:41.720 --> 50:47.720]  we'll be racist we're going to sabotage the christian ethic the ethos of unifying under christ
[50:48.840 --> 50:53.000]  that's why the west has been the folks that have reformed slavery and reformed abuse and
[50:53.000 --> 50:58.280]  reformed all the things that was our strength was unifying people under free market ideas under
[50:59.000 --> 51:04.840]  protestant worth ethic ethos that many historians and others have pointed out
[51:04.840 --> 51:13.160]  and so they're organizing it into a system to totally bring the country down and trump has
[51:13.160 --> 51:18.360]  to go ahead and just come right out with it and he has to go ahead and come right out with the fact
[51:18.360 --> 51:24.680]  that china has infiltrated owns our debt owns hollywood controls most of the universities
[51:24.680 --> 51:31.560]  through treason and is working with leftist to absolutely take the country over if you were
[51:31.560 --> 51:35.800]  going to take america over you'd feminize the men you put chemicals in the water you'd break up the
[51:35.800 --> 51:40.440]  family you dumb people down the average adult spends half their time watching tv that study
[51:40.440 --> 51:45.800]  came out yesterday you would play down nationalism you would play down sovereignty uh you would play
[51:45.800 --> 51:53.000]  down all those things except in little limited areas you controlled and then you would get the
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.000]  country into debt to that foreign power and then you would have them come in and buy up the media
[51:57.000 --> 52:04.680]  and the universities and then try to break down the borders and bring in unlimited numbers of
[52:04.680 --> 52:10.040]  non whites who if they were taught about the constitution bill of rights some type of operating
[52:10.040 --> 52:15.640]  system like a christian ethos where we unify around our shared values that will work that will take
[52:15.640 --> 52:21.320]  us to the stars it's why christianity is so successful everywhere but no instead they go
[52:21.320 --> 52:27.240]  with a divide and conquer total race-based system and put chips on the shoulders of the millions
[52:27.240 --> 52:32.920]  and millions of invaders they're bringing in the good news is though hispanic americans and black
[52:32.920 --> 52:38.600]  americans in poll numbers in the last year are showing double the support they did even in fake
[52:38.600 --> 52:45.800]  polls even in skewed polls for trump a year ago they get it they've been watching people figure
[52:45.800 --> 52:51.400]  out when there's a scam going on they feel you can get fooled for a while but then people are going
[52:51.400 --> 52:55.080]  to wait a minute he didn't really say that he didn't really do that well wait a minute they're
[52:55.080 --> 52:59.480]  lying about all that wait they're trying to divide people i mean we can't just have a totally open
[52:59.480 --> 53:04.680]  border and abolish ice and say there's no control a lot of folks that fled from mexico are like please
[53:04.680 --> 53:13.400]  don't do that god that's what i ran away from and so people get it look at these numbers poll
[53:13.400 --> 53:18.920]  trump approval 50 that's in fake gallup polls and others where they had 15 more democrats
[53:19.480 --> 53:24.520]  five points higher than obama at this point in the presidency in the same poll hispanics boosting
[53:24.520 --> 53:35.480]  numbers that's drudgereport.com so he's broken through their hoax he's broken through their lies
[53:35.480 --> 53:39.160]  people now know they were conned and we're going to break through on the sandy hook stuff where
[53:39.160 --> 53:44.360]  they're lying about what i said we're gonna break through on all the things that they've manufactured
[53:44.360 --> 53:50.520]  about me where they pick a topic and they say trump lies all the time trump is the most biggest
[53:50.520 --> 53:54.040]  liar in the world you see that talking point everywhere he just everything he says is a lie
[53:56.440 --> 54:02.520]  and you read the fact checkers just like i say everything we say is a lie fake news fail facebook
[54:02.520 --> 54:08.840]  flags accurate info or story citing un documents the un says we will bring in 600 million migrants
[54:08.840 --> 54:13.800]  we will politicize them and we will use them to get rid of the capital of society it's all
[54:13.800 --> 54:19.960]  in the un document linked at the un website but they said it's false completely false on the
[54:19.960 --> 54:28.920]  political meter because paul talked about how discover it revealed well no one's never seen
[54:28.920 --> 54:37.800]  these documents un plan to flood america with 600 million from 2002 now false misleading info or
[54:37.800 --> 54:43.080]  story says un plans to flood america with 600 million migrants and he goes on to say it's
[54:43.080 --> 54:48.040]  misleading doesn't say how and then you go to our article it links to the un saying it word for word
[54:48.040 --> 54:53.320]  and we have copies of it saved right here and that's why they want to take us down i mean i've
[54:53.320 --> 55:05.000]  got macron right here two weeks ago shed on tv you have a speech endorses 200 million plus mass
[55:05.000 --> 55:16.440]  migration plan he called it your africa i mean that's that's mainstream news he gave a speech we
[55:16.440 --> 55:24.440]  played it so they say trump you never said that we shouldn't have the iraq war in 2003 you're a liar
[55:24.440 --> 55:31.000]  and then we played fox news and cnn four clubs of it and what i'm saying is i know you know they lie
[55:31.000 --> 55:38.040]  but it's next level lying folks for the talking point is trump hates all mexicans and says they're
[55:38.040 --> 55:43.800]  all murderers and rapists there's no such clip you see there's a lot of good people in mexico we need
[55:43.800 --> 55:48.040]  to get the good ones up here and we need to vet them so you they don't have a criminal record
[55:48.040 --> 55:51.960]  and if you've been here a long time and and you're you are working and you're good well fast tracking
[55:51.960 --> 55:55.960]  the citizenship needs to be made easier if you're a good hardworking person but if you've been deported
[55:55.960 --> 55:59.640]  five six times and you've got an armed robbery conviction you're gonna be deported you know a
[55:59.640 --> 56:03.320]  lot of people coming across aren't even from mexico they're from all over there's murderers and there's
[56:03.320 --> 56:10.600]  rapist that turns into trump saying all mexicans are murderers and rapists it's a lie it's a fraud
[56:10.600 --> 56:15.720]  and imagine the people saying it are the ones actually saying all mexicans are murderers and
[56:15.720 --> 56:22.840]  rapists just like they keep saying alex jones says go to the sandy hook parents house you know be
[56:22.840 --> 56:27.000]  violent do all there's no video there's no audio that it's not true the new york times
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.320]  had all these things that weren't even quotes
[56:32.600 --> 56:37.880]  and it says jones says go to their houses never said that in fact stop saying i'm saying that
[56:37.880 --> 56:43.800]  and we and we're we i met with lawyers last night we have very good lawsuits very good
[56:43.800 --> 56:47.080]  lawsuits and i know the media does this we're thousands of publications do it so you think
[56:47.080 --> 56:51.400]  there's strength in numbers like i mean if he sues us he'll only pick off a few people i mean
[56:51.400 --> 56:57.480]  that's the tactic it doesn't matter i need to raise a lot of money because i'm not a litigious
[56:57.480 --> 57:02.760]  person but we have to start suing the media when they show quotes that i never said
[57:02.760 --> 57:06.840]  and when they're telling people alex jones says go after people's kids and all these lies
[57:06.840 --> 57:13.480]  i have to sue them i have to and i and i've done that i've done some lawsuits you've noticed
[57:13.480 --> 57:18.920]  since i sued countersued five people suing me there've been no more lawsuits the last few months
[57:18.920 --> 57:23.400]  see so i mean we know what we're doing here but it takes a lot of money and the right lawyers

[1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:32.040]  because republicans basically don't even usually run candidates in new york city against the other
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:39.400]  person but they they are and they should do exposure she stormed los angeles which again
[1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:46.040]  is descending into a burning stinking piles of feces everywhere heroin needles everywhere
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:56.120]  hellhole a veritable hellhole she storms into that and then goes down to the border and and
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:01:01.080]  bitches and complains that there's a fence there uh yeah lady the mexicans got a fence right past
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:07.080]  that too they got a wall on their southern border because guatemala is even way worse than mexico
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:11.800]  it's a real shame mexico's a really neat country and has had some better periods but
[1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:20.760]  but corruption set in so the social compact was broken and you've got the british aristocracy
[1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:24.920]  the controlled america that we kicked out but they never really kicked out the colonialist out of

[1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:20.840]  and say alex jones is bullying kids and and and doing things i haven't done and then everybody

[1:07:54.920 --> 1:07:59.320]  know let's take him off for hate speech on youtube or facebook or spotify they never say
[1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:05.080]  what i was taken down for they say he beat up a child forb said they don't show where it was
[1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:09.640]  how it happened like any other report would always say at the corner of this and that mr
[1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:14.040]  jones reportedly did this they just say hey he likes some hate hate video where he chokes a kid
[1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:18.280]  and throws him the ground no as a kid in another state beating people up hitting adults and the
[1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:23.800]  adult pushes him down and it's not me and it was from abc news but doesn't matter
[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:29.160]  they've taken down they've blocked live streaming for us and they say one more thing you're banned
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:35.480]  forever so that's digital book burning and now you see congress people being shadow banned the
[1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:39.320]  president already is shadow banned on twitter they he's got hundreds of millions of followers they
[1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:42.840]  only let him get like a hundred thousand people that see it you have to go to the president's
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:47.240]  site so brandon tatum's gonna ride shotgun with us for the hour to go over all of this i'm gonna
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:56.600]  play some clips from the morning job and other places where they are again saying that i'm
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:02.120]  suing the sandy hook parents no they're suing me and when you sue somebody in texas it triggers
[1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:07.560]  the law that if you lose when you follow the suit you've got to pay attorney's fees unless the party
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:15.960]  being sued waves them i waved them to take the high road and they said that i sued them that's
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:21.960]  next level deception and then get to watch mr hammer it's told that on the show by the democrat
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:28.040]  he believes it we have to stop believing these people you have to demand to see the video or
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:33.080]  the article brandon tatum thank you so much for joining us you i plugged twitter and youtube
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:37.320]  but you're censored more and more uh where's the best place for people to go find you or you can't
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:44.280]  be censored well you're getting let me see i guess i'm censored everywhere right now i'm developing
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:49.640]  my website to try to get a more efficient website but i guess you know my facebook is going to be
[1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:55.880]  a go-to thing right now or youtube where you can see all of my videos and on those two websites
[1:09:57.320 --> 1:10:02.280]  we're trying to develop a avenue where people can go and click through and find specific
[1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:06.360]  places to follow and all the information that they need so we're in a development period but
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:13.400]  once we get it all done that uh brandon old tatum dot com will be the go-to website and again as
[1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:18.120]  rudge said here two years ago in studio it's time for all of us to move out of these electronic
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:22.760]  ghettos of facebook twitter and youtube and have our own thing it's hard it's expensive everybody
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:28.600]  can't do it but letting them get control of 90 of the web which they have really has given them
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:32.520]  almost checkmate power and i think congress needs to start moving against this what do you think
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:37.160]  no i agree 100 i mean they're censoring our speech i mean the people who need
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:42.440]  quality information from shows like this from things that we put out on our social media
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:47.400]  they're not getting access to this stuff and it's shameful and it's hurtful to the american people
[1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:52.440]  because on one end you have fake news cnn and these other places that are that will literally
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:58.360]  lie to our faces we cannot trust them and then when we put out quality stuff with with information
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:02.920]  that is backed empirically all of these different sources and stuff like that especially your show
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:08.040]  people aren't having access people tell me all day long what brandon i don't get notifications
[1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:14.200]  anymore i can't see any of your material they're banning you i had a person send me a screenshot
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:20.200]  of i can't remember was it a live stream or not but it was removed from their page because it was
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:26.760]  considered spam and all i was doing on the video was talking about being a victor not being a victim
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:31.480]  is being inspired and believing in yourself so i mean these people are censoring us and i think
[1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:36.600]  that we have to go beyond the social media websites and that's why i'm trying to develop a more
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:44.840]  um i guess active page active um i guess website that people can go on and have access to everything
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:49.560]  that they can see on all my social media but yet and still have access to my email and other personal
[1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:55.400]  things that they can communicate with me just in case they shut it all down well here's an example
[1:11:55.400 --> 1:12:00.440]  um i did a video this morning and said go to the record we waived attorney's fees no one ever does
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:06.520]  that the media was all there at the sandy hook lawsuit yesterday in austin and people sent me
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:12.760]  screenshots where they put out a notice saying that i'm fake news and that i am suing with sandy
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:19.240]  hook parents i mean they they put that on my video that's somebody retweeting uh what happened
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:23.880]  they did the same thing on paul watson scroll down and show tv viewers that he put a un document
[1:12:23.880 --> 1:12:29.560]  about wanting 600 million migrants in the us officially from the un and when you go to political
[1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:35.480]  fact they don't deny it they just say well it's false and misleading because the he uses the
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:40.200]  term revealed well no one knew about this till paul found it i mean macron said the same thing so
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:46.360]  this is just crazy how these so-called fact checkers they're the frauds right and it's it's
[1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:50.600]  just like the nazis would do they take it and burn books burn rewrite history and they're
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:55.160]  they're literally doing this and this is not they're not using actual fires they're not burning
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:13:00.520]  actual books but what they're doing is being deceptive on one of one of the biggest platforms
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:04.840]  that have the most influence they're censoring our stuff and they're burning essentially the
[1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:09.880]  books of information that we have and then they're repackaging them as true and they're lying to the
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:14.280]  american people and i think people have to sit down and ask themselves why are they doing this
[1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:21.080]  why in the world are they censoring your show your show is probably the most profound show that
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:26.680]  i've ever seen i watched it i got great information and that's how i was able to um understand what
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:31.000]  donald trump was doing because the news were lying they were lying about the polls they were lying
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:35.320]  they were lying about his speeches and this was one of the only shows that gave accurate truth and
[1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:39.640]  not only accurate truth but it projected into the future of realistic stuff that people could
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:45.000]  actually tangibly look forward to and why do they want to censor this stuff that that is the
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:49.480]  the proverbial question why why what what are they trying to get at and i think they're trying to get
[1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:55.240]  it at control like the nazis were doing like the democrats were doing back in the day they were using
[1:13:55.240 --> 1:14:00.360]  you know the kkk and they were trying to control america and make it the america that they wanted
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:06.120]  to be and we're not exactly taking it we take jama costa there's a clip of this we'll probably play
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:11.400]  later he's being booed everybody's seen that but then he goes i'm fact-checking you we're not fake
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:16.040]  news like he goes i'm god i don't care if you all think we're fake and are bullying me which is
[1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:20.040]  you're right you're all violent and you're gonna cause trump to get somebody hurt when it's the
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:23.400]  democrats calling for violence so just them saying singing in sucks and bullying them
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:30.440]  their free speech is now bad and then he goes i am fact-checking you you are fake news it's just
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:35.800]  like quomo on they're saying you're not allowed to read wiki leagues only i'm allowed so he magic
[1:14:35.800 --> 1:14:41.880]  wands and says that oh a crowd telling us they don't like us you're fake you don't exist what you
[1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:48.360]  say doesn't matter this is crazy i love what sarah sanders said at the at the press briefing
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:53.720]  she said we not only accept the freedom of press but the freedom of speech and these people genuinely
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:57.640]  believe that it's fake news and i don't think that it's just an opinion i think it's facts
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:04.440]  seeing in has been called several times doctrine documents lying about people using fake sources
[1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:08.440]  i'll give it give it hillary all the debate questions beforehand and lying about it yeah
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:13.960]  i didn't act like it don't exist they act like we're too stupid to look at it in these things
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:18.840]  that have been public record they lie there's people on tv admitting to giving the hillary clean
[1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:25.400]  questions what can they say they are fake news they are liars they are well i mean it's it's like
[1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:29.800]  it's like a costa and all them saying trump took out the martin was their kingbushed when they

[1:20:14.040 --> 1:20:24.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show you know why brandon tatum and our brothers even though
[1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:29.960]  we've never met in person is because we're christians and i don't say that up on some high horse and
[1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:36.440]  i'm some perfect guy on the center but in every culture in every society you can have a group
[1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:41.240]  of asians a group of whites a group of africans whatever group it is and the group that's really
[1:20:41.240 --> 1:20:48.440]  christian will be 10 times more productive whether it's in rwanda or whether it's in uh
[1:20:48.440 --> 1:20:56.920]  romania or or whether it's in paraglade it's well known everybody else just can't get it together
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:05.000]  and so it's christianity that gets us past tribalism and the new testament because the whole
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:09.640]  old testaments everybody killing each other over their tribe even people that were genetically
[1:21:09.640 --> 1:21:17.320]  almost the same it's a whole history of that and christianity is where you say no i have a set of
[1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:25.240]  values i believe in this in god the same god and so that's what unifies us and and then we
[1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:29.560]  transcend being tribal idiots to the next level like martin wither king talked about but you look
[1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:36.360]  at what the left push is it's diametrically opposed to martin wither king 100 180 look at
[1:21:36.360 --> 1:21:41.640]  this article on infowars.com it's gone viral i'm sure snopes or politifact will say it's fake because
[1:21:41.640 --> 1:21:48.120]  it's her actual twitter new york times you editorial board member celebrated dumb ass effing white
[1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:54.200]  people going extinct and there's even worse tweets she says are white people genetically
[1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:59.480]  pre-disposed to burn faster in the sun thus logically being only fit to live underground
[1:21:59.480 --> 1:22:06.920]  like groveling goblins it goes on let's hear both sides i mean this sounds like stuff you'd read
[1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:15.160]  on stormfront about jews horrible just just absolute crap but oh she's asian so it's okay
[1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:18.280]  and then they'll go jones is anti asian my sister's korean adopted nothing to do with asians
[1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:23.400]  i'll talk about china being corrupt that's the communist party she says i have the graphs
[1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:28.520]  and then she has the stuff that whites stink and smell like dogs i mean this is literally
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:33.400]  like the worst kkk stuff from like the 30s but it but turned around on white people
[1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:38.840]  and then she goes on to say that it's inconvenient truths that you know whites are evil and need
[1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:44.760]  to go extinct i mean this is genocidal stuff white people have stopped breeding you'll all
[1:22:44.760 --> 1:22:51.560]  go extinct soon this was my plan all along and then the devil sign and again this is this is the
[1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:57.000]  unifying factor at the universities and these crazy places where it's mainly weird white people
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:00.920]  i'm not trying to bash whites but weird liberals and all the videos or give me some muscle no whites
[1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:06.680]  allowed it's a white woman saying it at evergreen college or Missouri state so joining us is brand
[1:23:06.680 --> 1:23:11.400]  and tatum of a patriot uh a former swat team officer police officer now working with turning
[1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:14.760]  point doing a great job viral videos we're getting into censorship i did that little
[1:23:14.760 --> 1:23:22.280]  three minute intro rant that's just today and i've got stacks of other articles i mean if you flip
[1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:29.880]  this around this is like this is not see that this is exactly what the real nazi said this is
[1:23:29.880 --> 1:23:37.000]  exactly what it just played out repackaged and put in the 2018 there is no way on planet earth
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:42.680]  that what this young lady did would be acceptable if she said remotely said any of that about
[1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:46.840]  black people it's not acceptable to say it about white people but what i'm saying is the is the
[1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:53.400]  double standard that they have on the left you can openly hate police officers you can openly call
[1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:58.760]  for the death of police officers and hate white people is as much as you want as long as it's
[1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:05.320]  on the left and what they do is they use propaganda to justify the hatred they want to call us nazis
[1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:10.600]  they want to call us the racist so they can be then justified in hating us they want to kill us
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:16.920]  and it's unacceptable and these people are literally using brainwashing tactics to put
[1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:22.200]  people back on the proverbial plantation not just black people everybody not just white people
[1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:26.760]  everybody they want everybody to be under their foot they want to control everything at the top
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:31.080]  and they want us subject to that it's the same thing that the nazis did it's the exact same
[1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:34.840]  thing being played out in america today i'm gonna do a correction everything becomes a blurb
[1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:39.880]  when this stuff's going on uh but of course you have met you have been in studio
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:47.640]  i met before you were ever here in studio we we click uh just like with trump clicking we know america
[1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:52.280]  wasn't unstoppable engine i read the cfr reports 30 years ago about we've got to make americans
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:56.760]  poor so we control them hell bill mar says it on tv now so i'm not trying to take away trump's
[1:24:56.760 --> 1:25:00.680]  thunder he's done a great job and has courage that's just real thing is having the courage to be
[1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:05.400]  persecuted but all he had to do was get some of their tentacles off her face i use the tentacle
[1:25:05.400 --> 1:25:09.960]  analogy but face sucker like alien and trump's like trying to get the you know the tentacles off and
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:14.200]  the media and everybody else is saying no no no we're like but look we got oxygen now we're
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:18.760]  feeling better let's get the other tentacles off they're like no but what are they going to do as
[1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:26.120]  as we together brandom all of us get the tentacles off our neck i don't know i don't know they have
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:34.120]  to make drastic drastic measures i they're losing miserably you know everybody's waking up you see
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:39.240]  the huge walk away movement that that is a that is a movement of all people then you have a lot of
[1:25:39.240 --> 1:25:43.480]  african americans who have been brainwashed for years walking away from the democratic party and
[1:25:43.480 --> 1:25:48.680]  opening their eyes to reality and truth you have people like myself and kandace oans who are going
[1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:52.200]  out and we're dedicated and there's a lot of others i'm just speaking of people that i know
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:57.560]  personally we're going out and we're informing people we're giving them information education
[1:25:57.560 --> 1:26:03.160]  and inspiration that they can go and then disciple of the people to come to reality it's we're getting
[1:26:03.160 --> 1:26:09.480]  unplugged from the matrix man and they have to do crazy stuff central or social media
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:13.720]  i wouldn't even be shocked that they wouldn't actually come after us and try to attack us
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:19.400]  physically you see them pulling off trump hats shooting people at at baseball games i mean
[1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:25.160]  they're just going crazy mad because if they don't go crazy mad if they don't go extreme
[1:26:25.160 --> 1:26:29.320]  they will lose miserably and be vanished from the earth and i'm not saying physically vanished
[1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:33.720]  i'm saying the ideology will be there exactly their ideology is dying like i said i'm gonna have
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:38.440]  a showdown with mueller ideologically politically we're gonna win the shootout like the red river
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:43.080]  shootout o u versus ut it doesn't mean i'm gonna shoot him everybody knows that that's that's how
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:47.240]  they spin it one reason i want to get you on and i won't play the clips because if we play him
[1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:51.160]  they say community guidelines and ban us off twitter facebook and youtube even though it's
[1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:55.080]  been on local news and even though liberal news had to have met in portland and san francisco
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:27:00.920]  and everywhere they're attacking food trucks owned by hispanic people asians if they serve
[1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:06.280]  anyone coming out of the ice office and they're calling them inwards everywhere and then we have
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:12.680]  these videos out at the hollywood star where they were calling uh the beautiful joy avila a inward
[1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:17.080]  over and over again and then sure enough i haven't even announced this on one of our facebook's

[1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:26.920]  for playing them calling her the n word so they they get to say it we can't even show
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:32.600]  what they're doing and then they act like we've done it yeah they can't we're revealing the truth
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:37.240]  we're giving it context they can't have that they needed to be played out of context and they need
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:43.320]  to be able to twist the way they want to it is these people are not picking a group they hate

[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:32.760]  brandon tatum great patriot great spirit is to be joining us in a moment his sky drop
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:39.560]  mark ron daza who is one of my lawyers and is recognized as one of the top free speech lawyers
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:45.720]  in the country is here with me and we had a big pow wow last night i'm not gonna get too much inside
[1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:52.680]  baseball here on air but you were there when we said one dollar attorney's fees because we can't
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:57.320]  waive our right right comes through the state law uh it's state law that somebody sues you for
[1:34:57.320 --> 1:35:02.120]  defamation then it triggers that the judge could give attorney's fees or whatever the media spun
[1:35:02.120 --> 1:35:06.760]  that that i was suing them you're a lawyer you can explain because you were in the court today
[1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:12.040]  and not as my lawyer that's enok mark enok whose brother's spin court justice you name it and he's
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:15.880]  one of the top guys and he says on the facts and the law a hundred percent were there as you've
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:20.920]  said but then you know there's all this emotion and media manipulation but you were there and
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:26.600]  explaining this in the law the laws triggered just like they have in england now here in texas that
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:32.040]  if someone sues you for defamation it could be up to a hundred thousand attorney's fees if they
[1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:35.800]  lose the judge decides correct me if i'm wrong not not exactly okay well explain the point is
[1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:40.360]  we went and waived it all the media is all there and none of them reported it instead they said he's
[1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:46.040]  suing the poor people right how how an anti slap law works is we have the american rule
[1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:52.760]  the american rule means that if uh if there's a lawsuit both parties typically bear their own
[1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:57.000]  costs and fees none like europe where if you sue somebody and you lose you have to pay their
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:01.640]  attorney's fees now what that creates is this perverse incentive if somebody wants to shut you
[1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:06.600]  down for exercising your first amendment rights the process is the punishment you just sue the
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:12.440]  hell out of somebody and hey on the eve of trial you drop it or so what if you lose because if you've
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:17.640]  buried them in attorney's fees you've done the job well recognizing that that was a threat to free
[1:36:17.640 --> 1:36:23.800]  speech certain states starting with california started passing anti slap laws and an anti slap
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:30.360]  law allows you to take a first amendment case end it early you file a special motion then that case
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:36.840]  has to be decided right away on what's in the record at that time and if the defendant wins the
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:43.000]  defendant gets their attorney's fees back so california passed one oregon washington uh i was
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:48.040]  instrumental in getting one passed in nevada i've been working on one for pennsylvania ohio
[1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:52.840]  and texas passed a pretty powerful one as well there is no hundred thousand dollar limit in fact
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:58.200]  texas you not only get your attorney's fees but the court can also issue sanctions i mean there was
[1:36:58.200 --> 1:37:03.960]  a case here about two years ago where somebody got a million dollars and let's be clear no one waves
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:11.400]  that we did this never seen before in the history of an anti slap case where a defendant invoked the
[1:37:11.400 --> 1:37:18.600]  anti slap law but then specifically waived their right to fees now you've done that here in texas
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:23.960]  you did that openly yesterday and also in the connecticut case that i'm handling for you we put
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:30.440]  that in our briefing and and you think that would be news no instead i'm suing the sandy hook parent
[1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:35.240]  oh that's right oh my god that's two three weeks ago the connecticut briefing yes that i waved it
[1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:39.480]  oh and i bet they're gonna say i'm suing him with that suit in connecticut too well that's god this
[1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:44.440]  is just that's the dishonesty in the reporting i think you know that people are saying you're suing
[1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:48.440]  them for a hundred thousand dollars you're not suing them for anything you're the defendant so that's
[1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:53.240]  not how lawsuits work and anybody who's covered it's like they come up and punched me in the head
[1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:58.120]  or hit me in the head with a tire iron i go i won't even block it do it again they go he just
[1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:02.920]  hit me with a tire iron yeah yeah it's more like you're hitting the tire iron with your face um so
[1:38:03.640 --> 1:38:08.920]  in waving that those fees you know what you've done is in this case uh you have
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:14.760]  invoked the anti slap law to end the case early but you have not taken advantage of and you've
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:20.280]  actually waived one of the key benefits which is the money and i you know i think that was a good
[1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:25.560]  idea because you know nobody wants to these people lost their kids you advise me to do it some of
[1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:29.640]  the other lawyers didn't they just said but yeah well let's not talk about what i advise you can't
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:34.680]  get into it yeah right but i'll just say it's a i think it's a good idea but i was told by others
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:38.600]  they said watch they're not going to report it in fact you were in the courtroom enix said when
[1:38:38.600 --> 1:38:43.080]  they said mr jones waives the attorney's fees but so we can still keep the anti slap right to get
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:50.520]  dismissed quicker yeah that's the law one dollar and the and the the the the the the the the press one
[1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:55.640]  because they are well they knew they were gonna lie they're just come they're still saying today
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:39:00.120]  i'm suing them there was a collective groan in the courtroom that i was really surprised at i wish
[1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:04.920]  there had been tv cameras there because yes as soon as mr enok acknowledged that and said
[1:39:04.920 --> 1:39:11.640]  mr jones is waving anything over and above a dollar there was a a a a tone over the courtroom
[1:39:11.640 --> 1:39:15.720]  among the people who were there to hate you and by the way their side doesn't want cameras i'm
[1:39:15.720 --> 1:39:21.000]  demanding gavel to gavel coverage because how many videos did enok show of me apologizing to the
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:25.560]  families and saying i believe it happened years ago look what i found in yesterday's presentation
[1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:31.240]  there as a spectator what i found to be very interesting is this was probably the first time
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:36.840]  that anybody in that courtroom had actually watched info wars had actually seen what you said
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:41.960]  and if you watch what you said and you compare that to what the press has reported that you said
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:47.000]  it's as if those two things are happening on two different planets all right because i watched that
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:53.880]  video sitting there in that courtroom end to end and it you know at no point did you in that video
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:58.360]  say anything like what they've said you said i mean these are the videos they're suing me for
[1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:02.440]  that's true i'm sorry for your kids i believe they died that turns into i'm sending troops to their
[1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:07.080]  houses yeah and you know that was an accusation that was made by by the plaintiff yesterday there
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:11.640]  was an accusation that you had sent people to somebody's house um and then you know when we
[1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:16.200]  looked into the facts of that that doesn't seem to be exactly what happened either but you know
[1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:22.200]  that's uh what was rob do going look we're not saying it didn't happen but why are they delivering
[1:40:22.200 --> 1:40:26.040]  food another school and no food delivered for years or why do they say their house is a parking
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:30.680]  lot in florida we weren't saying where their house was look that's yeah when you look at the actual
[1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:36.440]  video you look at the primary source i mean when somebody has something to say to me about a broadcast
[1:40:36.440 --> 1:40:42.200]  or a publication i don't want to look at a news article that tells me what that says why don't
[1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:47.640]  you provide me a link i mean a third rate blogger would do that would provide a link to the actual
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:52.520]  primary source and say this is what the guy said click here to see for yourself it'd be like saying
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:58.360]  i said hypothetically cover my mouth because it'll edit you know murder all the jews or murder all
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:03.560]  the white people or murder all or inward you know that's you you would you would show me saying it
[1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:08.120]  i'm not saying that they'll do it yeah but i'm saying you would brandon tanham we got your skype
[1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:11.400]  back god bless you with us the next segment get into this but but you're hearing all as i see you
[1:41:11.400 --> 1:41:14.840]  nodding your head on skype because you said that's what you've experienced with them for us they say
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:19.880]  one thing you go actually see what i said it's the opposite yeah man you know the funny thing is i
[1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:25.400]  have people who were conservatives and people who um agree with me on many things and they say well
[1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:31.240]  no alex jones says all this and i say well show me the video you can prove to me that he's wrong
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:37.080]  about something you can say whatever you want but i remember watching way before the president was
[1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:41.080]  elected and you were talking about how they were rigging the polls and stuff like that and people
[1:41:41.080 --> 1:41:45.400]  were like oh he's just being so dramatic and all this other stuff and then you see them showing
[1:41:45.400 --> 1:41:52.360]  polls of of of hillary clinton up at 90 percent and then president won the presidency by a landslide
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:57.800]  somebody's line and they want to paint it on you but in that in fact these other people are the one
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:02.520]  telling them lies and you are articulating truths and if anybody watch any of the stuff that you
[1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:07.640]  say and this is what i tell everybody to watch it i say go and you find a clip you find a point
[1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:13.080]  and you prove him wrong if you can do that i'll believe you other than that you need to listen
[1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:17.080]  and pay attention well god bless you and i don't want to make it all about myself but they're coming
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:22.040]  for me yeah i mean this is like they're invading a country it's like every show every channel
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:26.680]  even fox look they're not just coming for you i mean that you know i agree once they're a very good
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:31.800]  target once they get me it's everybody you're a very good target because uh you know this is a
[1:42:32.680 --> 1:42:39.320]  it's a propaganda war and they did not take a lot of conservative voices seriously you know and
[1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:45.560]  once this election happened i think that the left freaked out i mean i i see a lot of people who
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:50.200]  agree with me politically who say i can't believe that this happened how did this happen and they
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:53.960]  didn't realize you know they might be polling people about so now they are taking a serious

[1:46:52.600 --> 1:47:02.680]  word again thank you so much for being part of the second american revolution you're listening to
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:21.480]  the alex jones show i got a star on my car and one on my chest a gun on my head and the right to
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:28.040]  arrest i'm a guy who's a boss on this highway so watch out what you're doing when you're driving my
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:34.200]  way if you break the law you'll hear from me i know i'm worrying for the state i'm a highway
[1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:41.880]  patrol well uh the president is wanting to get the public's intake the public's view on
[1:47:42.520 --> 1:47:47.960]  china's got a 900 billion dollar trade deficit with us it's estimated and uh all trump won was
[1:47:47.960 --> 1:47:53.880]  100 billion they said he said give me something god and they said no so he said listen we're
[1:47:53.880 --> 1:47:57.640]  gonna have a trade war so he wants the public's feedback next hour i'm gonna get into that
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:03.480]  trump's free trade plan could be his reagan moment down that wall uh mr. gorbachev you
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:07.480]  how about china you you actually reciprocate a little bit here i mean trump's not asking for
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:11.560]  that much he's like give me something you know it's it's like you go out to dinner with somebody
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:15.800]  and you go i'll pay for 90 of the bill but why don't you get the dessert they're like no it's
[1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:20.760]  totally unreasonable new york times admits it hired editor despite knowing about her
[1:48:20.760 --> 1:48:26.120]  horrifying racist tweets so new article they're not denying that she said white people are evil
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:33.320]  goblins and need to be exterminated and uh all this other craziness now the new york times is
[1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:38.360]  defending and brandon tatum great patriot uh former police officer squad team guy now works with
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:42.840]  turning point usa and the great work they're doing i've got mark ron daza riding shotgun with me
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:46.600]  and let me ask you this brandom where do you at a gut level think this is ending because
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:51.800]  the economy's turning around numbers show that uh black americans spanish americans are double digit
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:57.080]  from what they were supporting trump that's really scaring the left even skewed polls were they over
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:03.400]  sample uh democrats 15 point show trumps at 50 percent but only 60 percent voted so in poll 50
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:08.120]  percent i mean that is five points ahead of what obama had a year and a half into his administration
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:13.160]  as well well where do you think we're at brandon tatum well i think we're headed in the right
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:17.240]  direction i think that this is you know this comparison came from the nests as soon as new
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:21.000]  movie is going to come out and everybody can see for themselves i don't want to spoil it
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:27.160]  but a component of it is that you know abraham lincoln had a very similar situation where it was up
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:31.960]  to him at a pivotal moment to change the country forever now it took a while you know there was
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:37.000]  things that were subsequently put into place once african americans were freed and things like that
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:42.120]  but i think that trump is doing the same thing we're watching growth happen we're watching our
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:48.440]  our um i guess image on a on a worldwide scale increase unemployment is down for african americans
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:52.120]  there's so many jobs out there we don't have enough qualified people to take those jobs and i
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:57.000]  think over time we're going to see things headed in the right direction and i think that our decision
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:03.160]  in 2016 actually saved america and people may disagree with that but we are watching things
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:08.920]  unfold in a historical manner i mean especially with the gdp being where it said you know the
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:15.160]  confidence in this in this country america first mentality all of those things are invaluable
[1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:20.120]  to to sending people in the right direction on giving america the proper trajectory and i think
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:26.040]  that the american people can see what's going on and in 2020 we want the same results and even better
[1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:31.400]  so i think we're winning this battle they they're just going down kicking and screaming i agree everybody
[1:50:31.400 --> 1:50:36.600]  likes the winner and every that's why the spanish numbers are exploding everybody gets it now i
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:41.080]  think the facade's imploding and i agree the ghost of the democratic party the kkk all their
[1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:46.840]  manipulations all their evil they're putting out their full attack right now because it's death rows
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:51.320]  but i don't want to be too confident uh mark randaza what do you think look i i don't think the
[1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:54.680]  democratic party i mean i know it's not going to be a popular view on the show but i don't think the
[1:50:54.680 --> 1:50:59.880]  democratic party's evil they just have a different philosophy you know their philosophy is to bind
[1:50:59.880 --> 1:51:06.440]  people through identity politics and run as a coalition of of identity you know of identity
[1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:11.480]  politics coalition that's the opposite of marlon's okay i agree and and they you know but but it has
[1:51:11.480 --> 1:51:15.080]  worked for them it's worked for them in certain areas it it definitely works for them in the
[1:51:15.080 --> 1:51:20.120]  cities yeah it'll definitely work to destroy the country too i don't agree with it and i don't agree
[1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:25.400]  with it now i like it you know but it's i don't think i don't think it works for them because
[1:51:25.400 --> 1:51:30.920]  when i went to california it was this was the present i saw nothing but homeless people scatter
[1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:36.120]  in the streets it smelled like pee and urine you know all all in the streets and the funny thing is
[1:51:36.120 --> 1:51:42.360]  is that downtown l.a is not majority african-american yet the majority of the homeless were african-americans
[1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:47.400]  you know the crime the crime capital why do african-americans statistically do worse in democrat
[1:51:47.400 --> 1:51:53.960]  areas well look at chicago look at baltimore the the murder capital of united states of america
[1:51:53.960 --> 1:51:59.320]  is run by democrats i mean so if anybody's struggling or if it's detrimental to anybody and
[1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:04.520]  this is historically the people on the left their philosophies don't work the welfare state didn't
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:08.440]  work for african-americans what they're doing in these democratic run cities are causing more
[1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:12.200]  i mean it makes everybody dependent we know dependency whether you spoil your kids or whatever
[1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:16.280]  it destroys people and it's pure evil so let me ask you this random tatum and we're never
[1:52:16.280 --> 1:52:19.240]  does continue the next hour with other guests joining us let me ask you this question
[1:52:23.160 --> 1:52:30.760]  as we see the trance starting to break at a gut level how do you think they could grab
[1:52:30.760 --> 1:52:35.320]  victory from the jaws of defeat i'm worried with them saying trump calling seeing in fake news
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:40.600]  blood's gonna be on your hands you're gonna cause violence these are the david gergen blood on
[1:52:40.600 --> 1:52:45.800]  trump's hands if there's violence the evil blue blood republican david gergen really a creepy weirdo
[1:52:46.760 --> 1:52:50.920]  costus saying the same thing trumps leading a hate movement against media no they're the
[1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:55.320]  ones calling for killing him and saying he's a liar all he does is expose him so i'm really worried
[1:52:55.320 --> 1:53:00.440]  about them staging something or getting some crazy to do something to attack their own people
[1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:05.080]  so they can play victim i mean at a gut level as a former police officer swat team guy what are you
[1:53:05.080 --> 1:53:09.640]  and your smart friends that look into these things i mean how do what type of tricks are they going
[1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:15.080]  to play because we know the lefts always staging attacks on themselves i think they're definitely
[1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:19.880]  setting themselves up to have an excuse in case something like this happens to then further push
[1:53:19.880 --> 1:53:25.320]  propaganda but i think that the american people we aren't that stupid we we listen to what they're
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:30.120]  saying even people that disagree with you and i alex or disagree with what's going on in the show
[1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:35.560]  they can see people holding bloody heads of president donald trump they can see the lies and
[1:53:35.560 --> 1:53:40.280]  manipulation they can see money in their bank accounts they can see that since he's become
[1:53:40.280 --> 1:53:45.560]  president homosexuals having lost rights women's aren't women aren't doing poorly african-american
[1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:52.040]  people aren't going back to to africa and returning to slavery i mean we are not stupid that's why he
[1:53:52.040 --> 1:54:00.280]  forgot they said that about trump they said he was going to bring slavery back right let's give me a challenge i can't believe that 40
[1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:05.720]  years ago when he got control golf courses there were still golf courses that blacks and jews couldn't
[1:54:05.720 --> 1:54:09.960]  go to trump's the one that did all that that's why the rappers all loved him then they turned it around
[1:54:09.960 --> 1:54:15.080]  that he's gonna send black people to africa look you know before he got elected the predictions of
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:21.160]  of what was going to happen when he got elected this fourth rake that was going to happen i mean i
[1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:25.320]  remember you had a lot of jewish friends were saying oh we're very scared about how anti-semitic
[1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:30.680]  is anti-semitic this guy is probably the most pro-israel president we've ever had that's what i mean
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:34.520]  it's like brandon said it's all upside down brandon and closing where do you think this is going
[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:40.600]  then i keep asking that because it's just crazy well you know i i really believe that god is in
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:44.600]  control of this i don't think president trump is the president by happenstance you know he shouldn't
[1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:49.400]  have been the president given all of tax and the government against them the fbi i mean he shouldn't
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:55.000]  be the president but i think god intervened because god wanted us to have a country that is prosperous
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:59.880]  that he wants to have a country that understands him and believes in who he is and i think that he's
[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:04.280]  going to control some of these things and god is going to make it better for us but we got to go
[1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:09.080]  through the war it's going to be a fight you know just like jesus got they believe they killed him
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:13.480]  but he rose on the third day so i think that there's light at the end of the tunnel and that god is
[1:55:13.480 --> 1:55:16.760]  in control and he's going to make everything better but we're going to have to go through a fight
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:21.400]  first brandon i totally agree with you and just like nennava they took the reprieve for 100 years
[1:55:21.400 --> 1:55:26.040]  and got it some people didn't the profit came i'm not saying it's a you know what i mean god's
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:30.520]  given us a chance here's prosperity can make it better come together you know martin Luther king
[1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:35.880]  type ideas really classical liberal ideas or if we reject trump i think that's when the judgment
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:39.560]  happens i don't think we're out of the woods i think we're being given the chance being shown
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:45.560]  things to be better and i think if we don't take this we're gonna lose everything i agree 100 percent
[1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:51.960]  i agree 100 percent can't you feel it too like the energy in the country it's so like it's good
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:58.120]  and bad it's like really strong well i'll tell you this man i was walking around uh lax car king
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:03.560]  just came from la and i had my make america great again hat on and the funny thing is and you know
[1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:09.000]  you hear animal if it's because my black privilege or not but you nobody attacked me nobody said
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:13.400]  anything to me except one lady and she told me she loved my hat and it's very brave for me to do what
[1:56:13.400 --> 1:56:20.200]  i did so i don't i don't know what mythical scariness that they're trying to portray but
[1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:27.400]  by and large if you are on boots on the ground type mentality people aren't as stupid as they're
[1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:33.400]  trying to make us think people aren't as openly hateful as they try to put together in clips
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:39.320]  and videos so i honestly believe that most people and you know half of america didn't vote this time
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:44.280]  around but i think most people are either in the middle or they're starting to wake up to
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:48.760]  realizing that this is just absolutely ridiculous and that's why the democrats are panicking
[1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:53.400]  that's why they have to use somebody like lebron james this is what they want to do
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:58.520]  see back in the day during slavery they would hold the biggest strongest slave they will beat him
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:02.440]  and they'll push him in front of the crowd and say if you disagree this is what's going to happen
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:07.240]  to you we will break your wheel so that what they do now psychologically is they put one of the most
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:12.920]  powerful influencers in the entire country they put him on and they say no matter because this is
[1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:19.080]  what he said no matter how big you get you still are the n word you still black they will still hold
[1:57:19.080 --> 1:57:24.680]  you down they just put that man in front of everybody in america and threaten them and show them
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:29.880]  that you no matter how big you get in this country no matter how free you are we still control you
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:33.960]  this is what they're doing to our brains and we're not having it and people like me are going to stand

[1:59:53.720 --> 2:00:01.720]  you
[2:00:11.960 --> 2:00:17.000]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:00:18.840 --> 2:00:22.360]  park ron does his ride to shotgun with us uh coming up we've got one of the gentleman
[2:00:22.360 --> 2:00:25.720]  that's gonna be leading the prayer vigil he's an african american but he's gonna be called
[2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:29.400]  american just like i don't want to be called just human being will johnson united american
[2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:34.440]  first dot com the left says they're coming out there with guns to quote eliminate the evil nazis
[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:40.040]  that quote beat them up but the last two events they show up antifa attacks people gets their
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:46.280]  butt kicked but then antiva says we're going to shoot the nazis yeah and the black nazis the
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:52.680]  the this is the cuckoo level yeah the the violence that is both uh engaged on engaged in and condoned
[2:00:52.680 --> 2:01:00.440]  i mean in san jose the police funneled trump supporters into armed antifa protesters i mean
[2:01:00.440 --> 2:01:04.920]  there was a there was a case in the ninth circuit that just got decided handled by a great lawyer
[2:01:04.920 --> 2:01:10.920]  by the name of harm eat dylan uh where these people were beaten and the cops just stood by not only
[2:01:10.920 --> 2:01:15.960]  did they stand by and let it happen they funneled them into the gauntlet there that's it right there
[2:01:15.960 --> 2:01:20.920]  so you know it was just it's it's horrifying when you think of the fact that somebody in a
[2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:26.040]  liberal municipality would would do that i mean if i were in charge of the police force i don't care
[2:01:26.040 --> 2:01:31.080]  how awful the people are who are protesting you know if they were if it was the kkk marching
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:35.720]  i wouldn't struck my police they're better not be uh but the thing is the police come out and
[2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:41.320]  protect them but when it's actual prayer vigils with a multiracial group they allow them to be
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:46.040]  beat up look whoever because they don't want people coming together whoever it is the government's job
[2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:51.000]  in a situation like that is to stop the violence so no matter what i agree but i'm saying they they
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:54.920]  protect the kkk on purpose because that creates division well they should protect them on purpose
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:02:00.920]  but look yeah but i'm saying but they don't protect real patriot americans that are coming out look
[2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:07.640]  yeah this video here this was i understand yeah prayer vigil right i mean this is this is permissible
[2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:11.000]  and this is something that the authorities won't do anything about
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:17.880]  you know it's just it's horrifying i mean i i don't know why you know why we cannot band
[2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:22.520]  together and say that once you cross the violence words divide you're the one who's wrong
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:26.920]  all i know what ideas you're espousing you know i don't care how righteous you think you are
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:31.080]  when you think that you can cross over that line and attack somebody because of you don't like their
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:36.680]  speech you're my enemy and i don't care if i if i absolutely agree with your politics a hundred
[2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:42.440]  percent and that is that's just a credo that i don't see too many people of what is wrong with
[2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:48.680]  these anti-foot people i mean you know that there's any number of theories that you have but you
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:53.800]  know most of them are bored rich white kids that decided they want to play dress up revolutionary
[2:02:53.800 --> 2:02:59.000]  i agree it's a form of larping and i don't think they realize how much danger they're in because
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:04.360]  people are getting around i mean i know for a fact i know for a fact a lot of really serious
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:11.800]  retired veterans that have run most elite cia teams are really like yeah and look that's not
[2:03:11.800 --> 2:03:16.600]  going to help you know what i don't want to see is you know i don't want to see them get their own
[2:03:16.600 --> 2:03:20.200]  beat down i would rather see well don't worry it's not going to happen while they're out there in
[2:03:20.200 --> 2:03:23.880]  the little mask yeah i mean let the they're going to get snatched up put in a van well i don't want
[2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:28.280]  to see that either you know i want to see the cops do their job you stand there and say we're not
[2:03:28.280 --> 2:03:32.840]  going to allow violence in this no no i agree i'm just saying these guys can't go beat up women and
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:38.600]  children on video and not have real warriors start coming after i i really hope that isn't what
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:42.520]  happens because you know that's that's the big i can tell you right now they are being watched
[2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:48.680]  and people are yeah i see it too but you know and it's uh it's scary to me because i don't i don't
[2:03:48.680 --> 2:03:53.000]  want to see this expand because it seems like you know it's an arms race look first it began where
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:58.200]  it's okay to punch each other and then then you got people showing up with with shields and bats
[2:03:58.200 --> 2:04:03.720]  and now you have armed groups on both sides i mean that's that's not good for anybody how is that good
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:07.880]  for debate how is that good for democracy it's terrible we're going to wind up descending in
[2:04:07.880 --> 2:04:13.800]  armed gangs and you know whoever has the greatest amount of force wins i got two problems with that
[2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:18.600]  one problem is it's just evil in itself and the second problem is i got to tell my liberal friends
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:23.880]  out there if there is no way you're going to beat the right wing when it comes to violence
[2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:30.040]  because you know a bunch of like you know effeminate guys eating tofu who are out there crying about
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:34.360]  gluten in their coffee are not going to be able to win against people who go to the gym and shoot
[2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:39.080]  guns every day at the range i mean i would rather pick any two random right wing guys than the six
[2:04:39.080 --> 2:04:45.080]  best trained liberals anywhere if i'm in a street fight so you know the guys on the left you don't
[2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:50.600]  you don't have anything to gain from this it's not going to work they'll be right back stay
[2:04:50.600 --> 2:04:58.120]  where the smart condos is our guest big news straight ahead living in volcano may sound more
[2:04:58.120 --> 2:05:03.960]  dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on
[2:05:03.960 --> 2:05:10.520]  the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash
[2:05:10.520 --> 2:05:16.840]  may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels
[2:05:16.840 --> 2:05:23.960]  to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned
[2:05:23.960 --> 2:05:29.480]  was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next
[2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:34.920]  we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels
[2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:42.200]  within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on
[2:05:42.200 --> 2:05:48.520]  the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[2:05:48.520 --> 2:05:54.360]  can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will
[2:05:54.360 --> 2:06:05.960]  purify it waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the
[2:06:05.960 --> 2:06:21.880]  info war
[2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:33.400]  park ron does has been making a lot of amazing points during the breaks one of the top person
[2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:37.000]  lawyers out there and i don't want to just harp all day with all this news about us and
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:41.320]  how they're trying to censor us how they're lying about us but they're doing it and he was
[2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:44.520]  making the point earlier in the break the telltale sign when you get the calls and other lawyers
[2:06:44.520 --> 2:06:48.920]  get the calls and uh brandon tatum people saying you know in the fake right wing hey don't go on
[2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:54.600]  with alex jones he goes show me show me where he said something racist show me where he uh
[2:06:54.600 --> 2:06:59.240]  bullied the sandy hook people shut and they they can't do it and it's like the new york times
[2:06:59.240 --> 2:07:04.280]  the way they do backflips to lie and say that i'm bullying people's kids or i did this or that
[2:07:04.280 --> 2:07:09.480]  none of it's true or that or that even since they saw it in court where i said okay my lawyer has
[2:07:09.480 --> 2:07:16.600]  never seen anybody wave the right and an anti slapback to say we may we may not seek attorney's
[2:07:16.600 --> 2:07:23.080]  fees we did that and what do they say jones sues the families once their money the opposite
[2:07:23.080 --> 2:07:27.640]  because they're committed to evil and because they get away with it because there's a mob the
[2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:33.240]  media is lying here's the bottom line just like our information is powerful our products are powerful
[2:07:33.800 --> 2:07:40.040]  and i need people i even plug last hour i need folks to commit to financially support info wars
[2:07:40.040 --> 2:07:45.720]  and get air filtration get water filtration get non-gmo heirloom seats get supplements get t-shirts

[2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:55.240]  we will change the world together we will give you information that's over the horizon that proves
[2:07:55.240 --> 2:07:58.120]  right over and over again that's why they're obsessed with saying we're wrong because we've
[2:07:58.120 --> 2:08:01.960]  been right like brandon tayton that was so powerful last hour he kept laying out now every
[2:08:01.960 --> 2:08:06.680]  i i mean i helped wake him up i helped wake up kanda soans i helped wake up all a lot of folks
[2:08:06.680 --> 2:08:13.080]  because of you supporting us because we're here so you see the dividends of info wars

[2:08:19.720 --> 2:08:25.240]  the highest quality of vitamin b12 out there even bus fee did a hit piece not it tested by
[2:08:25.240 --> 2:08:29.560]  mark cuban's group in san francisco trying to sue us and they went well jones is really is
[2:08:29.560 --> 2:08:34.600]  good vitamin b12 it's pure but here's the best we're private labeling what they were selling
[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:40.760]  we're saying was the best they they're so dumb they didn't even know that we were 10 less private
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:46.600]  labeling than the top rated i go out and get the top rated most our products are private labeled
[2:08:46.600 --> 2:08:53.800]  we sell dna force plus it's 300 at doctor's offices for 75 dollars you don't know what's in it go read
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:09:00.760]  the thousands of reviews find out 40 off we also have the new fish oil the new krill oil and roll
[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:05.160]  call for your kids a smaller dose of concentrated fish oils other oils that are known for the brain
[2:09:06.440 --> 2:09:10.520]  very expensive process that it goes through to get all the mercury out because fish is great but it's
[2:09:10.520 --> 2:09:17.400]  got that byproduct this is down to non detectable levels unless they use the highest level spectrometers
[2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:22.520]  that's california testing levels for they try to stop us but this isn't the industry as clean as it
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:28.360]  gets in four store dot com in four's life dot com no reviews yet it's a brand new product support us
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:32.760]  financially we are in one hell of a fight and i don't care about money at the end of the day i want
[2:09:32.760 --> 2:09:38.520]  to win but it takes money like mid-air refueling of jet aircraft fighter bombers to get them to their
[2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:43.640]  bombers to get them to their location to hit the target so sign up for auto ship and additional 10
[2:09:43.640 --> 2:09:48.760]  percent off makes a lot of things lost leaders free shipping orders $50 or more every order has
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:55.320]  5% patriot points that builds up rapidly in uh that's a rewards program info war store dot com
[2:09:55.320 --> 2:10:03.800]  or triple a 2533139 we have the new info wars hexagon logo t-shirt in army green very very popular
[2:10:03.800 --> 2:10:11.240]  that just came out made america we then uh also uh have the mean like a wolverine and reelect 45
[2:10:11.240 --> 2:10:16.840]  you know i said hey walmart you shouldn't have taken down the impeach 45 t-shirt if that sells for
[2:10:16.840 --> 2:10:24.200]  you leave it up but but sell not even mine somebody else's reelect 45 we created our own
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:28.120]  because they marketplace of ideas and that's what you were saying during the break about Spotify
[2:10:28.120 --> 2:10:33.560]  and now they create the thing of well we went and saw two of his podcasts that are hate so we took
[2:10:33.560 --> 2:10:38.200]  those down but we're not taking him down they're all copying youtube to condition people to get
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:42.840]  ready well we gave him chances but he didn't stop but they never mentioned what i did so
[2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:47.480]  segue from spotify what you said off air into the new york times the rest of it well you know
[2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:52.520]  hate is such a malleable term i mean i you know it hate really means something an opinion i don't
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:57.240]  agree with because if you want to get rid of hate speech i mean i don't see how anything you've said
[2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:01.720]  is anywhere close to what that new york times columnist you showed earlier saying board member
[2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:06.360]  saying whites are subhuman yeah i mean the how is how is that not hate speech if there is such a
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:11.400]  thing i just hate that term hate speech because it's it's not a thing so so do you turn anything
[2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:18.040]  yeah it means jones is banned because he beat up a trans child not even true right so you know
[2:11:18.040 --> 2:11:24.440]  and what what really bothers me about your cases just globally is that i don't see anybody from
[2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:30.520]  the traditional media backing you up and i don't understand how they can look at this you know you
[2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:35.560]  you questioned the official narrative of what happened at sandy hook at some point you know at
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:41.480]  the beginning you said you made an investigation i don't care what happens anything that happens
[2:11:41.480 --> 2:11:46.360]  when i get an official story from my government if i'm not questioning it i want somebody else to
[2:11:46.360 --> 2:11:50.840]  question it to make me question it even if it comes around that hey let's maybe we're gonna
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:11:55.560]  have a rare circumstance where our government doesn't lie to us one bit i mean it might happen
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:12:01.320]  once in a while unicorns may exist but the point of the media is to be a watchdog you're the fourth
[2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:05.480]  estate you're supposed to be nipping at their heels but instead they're mercenaries but they
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:09.160]  make the point you made about spotify and then what you made about well about how people call you
[2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:13.480]  other colleagues you go show me where and it's never there right i mean look i take a lot of
[2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:17.560]  flak for coming on your show and representing you um there are a lot of people angry at me
[2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:23.880]  you have good friends family that you're not calling anymore and i say well you know tell me
[2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:29.240]  if you're so you hate this guy so much show me what the problem is and they'll send me a link
[2:12:29.240 --> 2:12:33.800]  to the new york times or they'll send me a link to some other article saying you're paraphrasing
[2:12:33.800 --> 2:12:38.520]  what you said i said yeah but now bring me to the original source and when i go find it and i
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:43.400]  said well that's not really what was said here well then you know then there's like this backpedal
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:47.960]  is like well he's enabling such speech or he's he's encouraging it say wait a second you know
[2:12:47.960 --> 2:12:53.480]  what i want you to think about is how we need a robust marketplace of ideas you know i don't come
[2:12:53.480 --> 2:12:57.320]  on your show because i agree with everything you have to say there's a no i agree but by the way
[2:12:57.320 --> 2:13:03.400]  talk about targeting our lawyers they know have randy will height that is my family court lawyer
[2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:08.040]  but all the other lawyers were scared to file even my defense until we got you and some other guys
[2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:11.560]  so randy did at least the first answer now they're calling he's a ut professor
[2:13:11.560 --> 2:13:18.440]  uh racehorse heinz protege top former criminal defense lawyer he writes the texas code on family
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:24.600]  law the guy is a boy scout okay you know captain of the football team hold on yards they are literally
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:29.400]  calling for his head look cbs news with randall will height so they're letting lawyers know too
[2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:34.280]  she are going to come after you'll ask you don't give him representation how unamerican is that i
[2:13:34.280 --> 2:13:38.360]  look the right to counsel is right up there with the right to free speech like sixth amendment
[2:13:38.360 --> 2:13:43.800]  uh yes so you know but if you if you just look at this you know i remember when uh you know before
[2:13:43.800 --> 2:13:48.440]  the election and i wrote this article here is the first amendment safe from donald trump
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:55.720]  on cnn and i was concerned uh because when trump made his speech that said we're gonna open up the
[2:13:55.720 --> 2:14:00.120]  libel law i was concerned too i don't think he got it and you know and it made me i mean i said wow
[2:14:00.120 --> 2:14:05.720]  that that got my hackles up i mean i am not you know but now in his own cases he's he's using
[2:14:05.720 --> 2:14:11.000]  anti slap it's kind of funny isn't it you know how this is flipped because now that he got elected
[2:14:11.560 --> 2:14:18.040]  now it is not donald trump but people are anti donald trump who i should have written this article
[2:14:18.040 --> 2:14:22.120]  i should have written another version's article saying is the first amendment safe from people who
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:27.080]  are have trumped arrangement syndrome you know that i remember last night we were talking and
[2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:32.680]  somebody said uh you know hey has the right ever really done this and i had to correct him and i
[2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:37.880]  said yes if you if you bring the camera down here heed their rising voices new york times versus
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:43.640]  sullivan the foundational case when it comes to our first amendment rights where it was
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:50.360]  constitutionalized that in if you are talking about a public figure and then expanded to public events
[2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:57.240]  you must prove defamation over the actual man this was the south of the kkk shooing everybody
[2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:03.160]  to shut down what it was it was exactly what you have going on today it was the civil rights movement
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:08.760]  was invading the south with people who are writing about equality with people who are trying to
[2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:14.200]  make this idea of equality and civil rights infected you know they were trying to spread
[2:15:14.200 --> 2:15:19.080]  this idea and how did these people who wanted to fight against equality deal with it they dealt
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:23.640]  with it through these kind of crazy defamation suits where they were trying to bankrupt anybody
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:28.600]  who came down there and tried to report and now the left is trying to get rid of new york times
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:33.880]  versus sullivan they admit to overturn the first amendment so they can but i guess it's the democrats
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:38.680]  again so like new york times versus sullivan is sacred as far as i'm concerned and you know so far
[2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:43.240]  i haven't seen donald trump actually do anything to go against it i think his two supreme court
[2:15:43.240 --> 2:15:48.760]  nominees would support it and i can't say the same for the supreme court nominees on the left so
[2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:53.960]  the democrats are going after new york times versus sullivan at this point it looks that way yeah we'll

[2:20:46.200 --> 2:20:53.720]  we got some bad news here i hate to interrupt mark randaza with something like this especially
[2:20:53.720 --> 2:21:00.680]  but active shooter at right paterson air force base chicago cbs is reporting they've got a man
[2:21:00.680 --> 2:21:06.520]  barricaded the hospital wing might be mental illness or ptsd who knows and we don't really
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:14.120]  have any more details active shooter at right paterson air force base the stories are all
[2:21:14.120 --> 2:21:21.880]  up on info wars dot com and info wars dot com also has links to some live feeds as well so we're
[2:21:21.880 --> 2:21:27.400]  going to be tracking that w d t n reports that a man has barricaded himself on the fourth floor
[2:21:27.400 --> 2:21:32.440]  of the base hospital the state power patrol the local police are sending personnel the base ap
[2:21:32.440 --> 2:21:38.040]  reported i don't have any other details but i hope that nobody's been hurt uh personnel i've been
[2:21:38.040 --> 2:21:42.920]  communicated the base the lockdown over loud speaker let's get that audio of that loud speaker if
[2:21:42.920 --> 2:21:48.600]  we can i do notice that base troops are armed that's good trump's been arming you know the base is
[2:21:48.600 --> 2:21:53.160]  more obama had them disarmed so the major hassan could do whatever he did obviously they're at
[2:21:53.160 --> 2:21:57.720]  four they said wasn't terror related but obviously it was uh so we're obviously watching that as
[2:21:57.720 --> 2:22:01.800]  unfolds uh mark randaza first amendment lawyer getting back to the point you wanted to make
[2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:07.560]  yeah on some of the other points uh about how there's a war on the first amendment and i don't
[2:22:07.560 --> 2:22:13.960]  get how they want to set a precedent in georgetown your alma mater and uh some of the other universities
[2:22:13.960 --> 2:22:19.480]  have signed on saying you know we need to shut alex jones the right wing off they believe they're
[2:22:19.480 --> 2:22:24.040]  going to selectively in court then protect themselves this is cutting your nose off despite
[2:22:24.040 --> 2:22:29.000]  your face so i i think you were talking about a big fake suit that the mother jones one that
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:32.280]  cost them almost everything they had yeah you know i don't agree with mother jones they no we
[2:22:32.280 --> 2:22:36.280]  used to fame me they have a first amendment sure but but but you know i i think i'm going to send
[2:22:36.280 --> 2:22:41.240]  mother jones a donation for the first amendment of of of three dollars because there's fakes
[2:22:41.240 --> 2:22:45.720]  three dollar bill but i'm going to send him three dollars look mother jones you know i i think no
[2:22:45.720 --> 2:22:49.480]  matter what you believe you know mother i know mother jones probably not your favorite publication
[2:22:50.040 --> 2:22:54.280]  you know they've written negative things about me for people that i've represented but when i you
[2:22:54.280 --> 2:23:00.520]  know when people want to say i support these slap suits i support these censorship suits against media
[2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:05.480]  because i don't like the media that's being sued you got to think about this like if you create a
[2:23:05.480 --> 2:23:09.320]  weapon you let a wild animal out of its cage and then get surprised when it attacks you
[2:23:09.880 --> 2:23:14.840]  that's what's going to happen this case is mother jones case i mean this was wrong this was a
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:19.960]  unsupportable defamation suit a billionaire sued the publication to try to punish them because he
[2:23:19.960 --> 2:23:25.800]  didn't like what they said about him that case eventually they want it and mother jones is still
[2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:30.120]  years later begging for money to try to pay their legal defense fund i mean if look whether you
[2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:34.040]  write a one dollar check a three dollar check or a substantial check you know sending something to
[2:23:34.040 --> 2:23:39.080]  support them i think that even if you hate mother jones i think people listening to the show i'm sure
[2:23:39.080 --> 2:23:43.160]  it's not the great biggest number of uh you know venn diagram great holly people listen to this it's
[2:23:43.160 --> 2:23:46.920]  a great hollywood style to get people thinking about we all have to support the first amendment
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:51.480]  exactly i'm a small there's three dollars when you don't like the speech and you see them trying
[2:23:51.480 --> 2:23:55.960]  to be suppressed that should that should get your hackles up because you're not you're not making a
[2:23:55.960 --> 2:24:00.040]  donation to mother jones and look i don't get anything from that they didn't hire me but you
[2:24:00.040 --> 2:24:04.600]  make a donation to mother jones you're not just making a donation to help that what you're what
[2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:08.360]  you're doing is you're standing up for the first amendment well you're cutting across party lines
[2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:12.280]  because if we don't all support it we're going to lose it we don't you have to gather we're all
[2:24:12.280 --> 2:24:16.840]  going to hang separate and that's and that's why this you know that's why i look at your cases
[2:24:16.840 --> 2:24:22.600]  and i say you know where the hell's the cavalry where are where is the new york times where are
[2:24:22.600 --> 2:24:28.200]  you know where is cnn even if they want to report negatively on you how do they not see
[2:24:28.200 --> 2:24:33.800]  that if this case goes forward that that is a landmine that they're going to step as they're
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:39.400]  bringing authoritarianism in google's officially moving to china apple already is google execs
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:44.360]  have leaked info saying no they're building censorship engines here it's already here mark
[2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:49.080]  they're we're going to go into a post freedom world the new york times calls me the post truth
[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:53.400]  world no you're the post truth world a lot about wmds the truth tried to come back now you're
[2:24:53.400 --> 2:24:57.560]  trying to silence everything they're going for broke mark they believe it's going to be selectively
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:25:02.520]  enforced you know i i just don't you know i have these multiple alternate realities where we wind up
[2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:08.280]  you know i'm i'm still hoping that eventually we wind up in a place where there's a there's a
[2:25:08.280 --> 2:25:13.160]  not with trump derangement syndrome man they said every news publication that's established but says
[2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:17.800]  he says all mexicans are murderers and rapists there is no video there is no audio they have
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:23.240]  committed to the dark side they have joined imper palpatine it's it's their interpretation of it but
[2:25:23.240 --> 2:25:29.880]  what i want to see is you know i'd love to see one day a hearing in one of your cases and people
[2:25:29.880 --> 2:25:34.760]  standing out there protesting saying support the first amendment even though i hate alex jones
[2:25:35.320 --> 2:25:39.640]  like that that's a purist there's maybe eight of us out there i don't know but those of you who
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:43.320]  believe that oh well don't worry we're gonna see it going we're going to call the troops out you
[2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:47.400]  know people but people listen to this show and you buy in large conservatives but when you see
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:51.240]  something like this when you see a case like this against a mother jones or against some other
[2:25:51.240 --> 2:25:56.840]  liberal media you ought to be just as worked up as you are about no no exactly but you're trying to
[2:25:56.840 --> 2:26:01.000]  sell people on being american and i'm telling on the left they've totally i can't believe i have to
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:05.720]  sell that but let's expand on that i mean what is we've now spent a lot of money to have a big law
[2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:10.200]  firm here in texas go through everything i've ever said and the law firm itself even liberals in
[2:26:10.200 --> 2:26:13.800]  the law firm couldn't believe how the media and others have lied about what i said about sandy
[2:26:13.800 --> 2:26:22.120]  god it's incredible to see mark the the the the the the total deception yeah i i don't i just i just
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:26.840]  find it really depressing that you know as you said yes i'm trying to sell america that's exactly
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:31.880]  what i'm marketing here i mean i'm you know i am not here trying to sell the right wing point of
[2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:37.160]  view i really don't but they're not listening to you they're in a cult they're not liberals well
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:41.480]  they're not virtuous people they're control freaks they're followers or they're controllers
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:47.240]  yeah well the left is a corporate committed juggernaut plan funded by communist china that
[2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:53.000]  sells buddhist and christian's organs for no reason okay they're committed to evil they have
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:57.640]  a plan they're following i mean i think i have a lighter view of it i think a lot of the people
[2:26:57.640 --> 2:27:03.080]  on the left who they believe they're doing the virtuous thing they believe that hey you know
[2:27:03.080 --> 2:27:07.560]  it's kind of like the communists in russia believed they were doing the right thing sure
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:12.600]  here's what happens if we average adult spends more than half their time waking on a screen or tv
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:17.000]  they they they give them all the dopamine of feeling good and getting rewarded by twitter
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:21.880]  facebook and google when they say anti-american anti-alexation stuff so they feel like they're
[2:27:21.880 --> 2:27:27.720]  winning and they're all just scrabbleing wanting more dopamine and so by successive approximation
[2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:32.520]  they're incrementally trained into all this well yeah the the rush that i think people get from
[2:27:32.520 --> 2:27:36.280]  beating up on somebody you know huxley said something about like there's there's no
[2:27:36.280 --> 2:27:41.160]  no better way to to get people on your side than to give them license to be cruel to other people
[2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:47.400]  and you know when i saw yesterday i i saw news article about how many people were trying to
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:27:54.440]  petition spotify to knock you off the platform and there was no statement of irony in the article
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:59.880]  that half these people were in the media when i see soledad o brian trying to ask that you be kicked
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:05.320]  off of spotify because she doesn't like your views what in the hell is that does she not understand
[2:28:05.320 --> 2:28:10.280]  what business she's in i mean soledad o brian no but see she knows him next she thinks if she
[2:28:10.280 --> 2:28:14.600]  shuts down her competition she'll have an audience it's exactly because she does know but until
[2:28:14.600 --> 2:28:19.640]  they come for killing truth she's in the business of murdering up freedom well until they come for
[2:28:19.640 --> 2:28:24.680]  her you know that's the problem that you know does does nobody remember pastor neemola i mean
[2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:29.960]  yeah look at this is o brian what the hell is wrong with you i mean a journalist saying that
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:33.720]  but notice another goes with the whole deal will never report that i waived the fees
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:38.440]  but the texas law triggers if they lose the suit but even then law even then even if this
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:43.640]  were true even if you were seeking a hundred thousand dollars or a billion dollars from that
[2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:47.960]  why does that mean you should be knocked off the spotify so what but that's the things
[2:28:47.960 --> 2:28:51.720]  they're going to use and they don't care that you were there the lawyer got up we're not doing that

[2:33:58.920 --> 2:34:05.160]  everybody oh the nazis attacked us for no reason at the last rally of portland and so we're coming
[2:34:05.160 --> 2:34:12.120]  with guns i mean it's like it's like it's like if i walked over and i wouldn't do this me you'll say
[2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:17.480]  i'm threatening this and i punched will johnson in the nose for no reason and then will johnson
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:23.560]  punched me and knocked me down and i went that nazi just beat me up everybody could see he's not
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:30.760]  a nazi and you just punched him first so we're gonna go ahead a minute i'm trying to understand
[2:34:30.760 --> 2:34:36.600]  what's going on with trump where he's like the russians are meddling in the election right now
[2:34:36.600 --> 2:34:42.040]  we agree we're not going to let them meddle and we're going to give federal funds to local governments
[2:34:42.040 --> 2:34:47.400]  to block it but i do know what's going on trump's been trying to get funding to stop the illegal
[2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:51.400]  aliens vote in the names of dead people and the democrats all the scams they're running so it's like
[2:34:51.400 --> 2:34:58.440]  oh you want homeland security to oversee the elections huh okay we'll do it he hasn't repealed
[2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:04.760]  obama's executive order all 50 attorney generals wrote letters including democrats saying this is
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:11.720]  a violation of the federalists act and the laws and federalism you can't do this so
[2:35:14.200 --> 2:35:18.120]  i mean i get that trump wants to watch the elections and those the democrats are famous
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:23.320]  for trying to steal them and project veritas caught all those videos but going along with the whole
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:27.480]  russia thing just kind of adds to it it's ridiculous does russia try to get involved in our elections
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:32.120]  yeah every major country does it we do it massively to them i think it's wrong
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:38.680]  uh but it goes on but mainly foundations in groups send money over to russia and then send money back
[2:35:38.680 --> 2:35:42.920]  here because there's a massive amount of money being used try to overthrow the russian government
[2:35:42.920 --> 2:35:47.720]  that's that's admitted about five billion a year they have press briefings the state department when
[2:35:47.720 --> 2:35:53.000]  obama was in about how they spent five billion in one year to overthrow ukraine an elected government
[2:35:53.560 --> 2:35:58.440]  and they say trump's involved in that the russians came into ukraine because they have a stake there
[2:35:58.440 --> 2:36:03.320]  and they were the elected government was overthrown i'm not defending that but i'm sure not sending
[2:36:03.320 --> 2:36:09.560]  them over right to do it cry me is where russia was founded but i'm digressing he will do anything
[2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:14.440]  to win the election 2020 we must stop him demand voter id and of course that's the big
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:20.120]  joke we've been putting those tweets out we've been putting those memes out so of others democrats
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:25.160]  change that matters and we've got to have voter id which is what the democrats don't want because
[2:36:25.160 --> 2:36:29.800]  they admit they have illegal aliens remember brandon you know tatum warning about this remember
[2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:34.360]  me warning about it remember everybody just last year we talk about how the democrats want
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:37.720]  illegal aliens to vote when legalized it trump will talk about it everybody talked about it
[2:36:37.720 --> 2:36:43.080]  and they say oh we're making it up now the democrats everywhere admit universal voting for any
[2:36:43.080 --> 2:36:50.600]  illegal alien they can get here and total open borders so don't let russia intervene folks we've
[2:36:50.600 --> 2:36:56.680]  got to have voter id the russian agents are everywhere voting for trump hashtag demand voter
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:04.680]  id yes there are russians everywhere i saw one one time doesn't matter they work for army special
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:10.600]  operations were highly decorated you cannot trust anyone of russian background they are going to
[2:37:10.600 --> 2:37:15.240]  pose as illegal aliens they're going to vote the names of dead people those are not illegal aliens
[2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:21.000]  those are russians dressed up like illegal aliens they're everywhere one right here so
[2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:27.400]  will johnson's here united america first dot com great patriot he found it back in 2016 when he
[2:37:27.400 --> 2:37:33.640]  saw what was going on again what do you make of i've noticed the antiflabogs in in in in portland
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:40.280]  say as i mentioned earlier i've already read this on air yesterday the nazis keep attacking
[2:37:40.280 --> 2:37:47.800]  uh minorities and lgbt they they attacked a bunch of them last time we're bringing out the guns i mean
[2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:53.160]  that's crazy everyone saw them attack you guys and you're not nazis it's it's unbelievable so are
[2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:58.600]  they delusional are they liars what in the world is going on with these people they're completely
[2:37:58.600 --> 2:38:03.960]  liars just imagine if you're at a picnic with your family and people find out that you're at a picnic
[2:38:03.960 --> 2:38:08.040]  with your family and then they come up then they start throwing rocks at you start throwing bottles
[2:38:08.040 --> 2:38:12.200]  at you start trying to hit you with stick and you take one of them out and then they're going to
[2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:18.120]  report it alie jones attacks someone at a park see that's exactly what they're doing here we're not
[2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:22.200]  inviting these people to come and be violent with us we're not inviting them to come there and fight
[2:38:22.200 --> 2:38:27.640]  with us we're not inviting them at all but they want to show up at an event that we are having
[2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:31.400]  and be violent towards us and then you have the mainstream media saying that we're the ones being
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:39.640]  violent they are completely insane they have lost their mind i totally agree we've got we're
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:43.320]  going to go right back to you in a moment we have breaking news here this is not me saying this
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:48.040]  they always misrepresent what i say when there's anomalies like the cops stood down
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:54.920]  in in in in parkland and then and then we covered it and then they said that we said nobody died
[2:38:54.920 --> 2:39:05.240]  but then they deleted the videos you couldn't see it this is abc news uh cbs news i've got a
[2:39:05.240 --> 2:39:14.680]  bunch of these here this is wpa fb live coverage w h i o u and i heard them saying this during the
[2:39:14.680 --> 2:39:19.320]  break and i'm like what they're like no no we're not kidding we've been told by law enforcement
[2:39:19.320 --> 2:39:27.480]  this is seven news in ohio at the air force base who have told us varying reports one law
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:33.560]  enforcement official told us on the record that the incident started as a training exercise oh no
[2:39:35.160 --> 2:39:40.280]  oh no that's that's not good you know what that means the officials just like they oh boy
[2:39:42.200 --> 2:39:46.040]  and then judge and then drudge had the story up it took it down so we're not sure about this
[2:39:46.040 --> 2:39:51.480]  the officials said something happened during the training and someone fired shots to get into a door
[2:39:51.480 --> 2:39:57.080]  that they could not get into another source said there's a situation with hostages and shots were
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:02.440]  fired someone tried to break out of the window or windows to get people out of the hospital the
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:10.440]  source said that the base is asking for canines not more law enforcement uh this doesn't sound too good
[2:40:10.440 --> 2:40:17.960]  and i was told by pentagon source i tweeted it out at six a.m expect all hell to break loose
[2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:23.720]  this pentagon source is telling me about fort hood being staged and they were there and i'm
[2:40:23.720 --> 2:40:29.160]  just leaving it that right now so let's pray for everybody hopefully no this is just a mistake
[2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:34.280]  nobody's been hurt we're not saying it's a drill that is in the news that will say that i said it's
[2:40:34.280 --> 2:40:41.480]  that that is not what i said uh will johnson please continue sir you know i want to say this
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:47.960]  mr jones one of the reason why they're attacking you is because you have influenced so many people
[2:40:47.960 --> 2:40:54.280]  to start speaking up i used to listen to you over 10 years ago when before even before obama came
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:41:00.200]  into picture and i was like who is this guy he's saying everything that is completely true i couldn't
[2:41:00.200 --> 2:41:04.600]  i and i started going to look at different things i started verifying it for myself is what
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:08.600]  are you saying is true and it happened to be true and then some of the stuff you were saying what
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:14.120]  they were going to do and then years later it became true see they are so afraid of you that's
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:19.080]  the reason why they're attacking you that's the reason why they want to remove you from every
[2:41:19.080 --> 2:41:25.880]  platform possible because they fear you have you ever known for them to be so scared of one man
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:30.520]  before they're scared of you they're scared of donald j trump and now they're scared of the
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:34.920]  american people because the american people are waking up to what is actually happening here
[2:41:34.920 --> 2:41:39.480]  and i want to thank you personally for speaking out for having the courage and i know you hear it
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:45.480]  all the time i hear it too but you know what it's going to take people like you myself brandon tatum
[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:50.840]  multiple people to keep fighting this good fight because if we don't we're going to wake up one
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:55.160]  morning and we're going to wonder what happened to our country well god bless you if people are
[2:41:55.160 --> 2:41:58.680]  always thanking me i appreciate listeners are involved and i don't want to make it about me
[2:41:58.680 --> 2:42:01.960]  and i want to make it about them because you guys are the victory but but now i've been so
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:07.160]  persecuted now i used to get tired of it i actually kind of like it now because i mean it's gotten
[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:10.920]  bad i can't even tell people behind the scenes people think it's bad on air i mean i just get on
[2:42:10.920 --> 2:42:14.440]  my knees every day and sometimes i cry and i'm not trying to be a wimp here it's god the way
[2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:18.520]  they lie what they've done to my family and i but but again it makes me glad i did this because it
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:22.200]  really proves we were right about these people and then i see people like you that have the courage
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:26.760]  to go out there in the face of this evil scum where the police protect them in these evil cities
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:31.400]  that really it really makes me feel strong to know you're there i'm telling you it to see more

[2:47:54.520 --> 2:47:59.160]  deposit it i mean you don't think in the whole universe with all these dimensions above us and
[2:47:59.160 --> 2:48:04.680]  below us and all the secrets of everything you just think you're just given that no
[2:48:04.680 --> 2:48:16.680]  you
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:22.360]  take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[2:48:26.680 --> 2:48:31.720]  your tv viewer you got to see that really really great work the crew did a great animator i think
[2:48:31.720 --> 2:48:36.440]  like he likes to do fun stuff too a little bit self-deprecating but it's it's fun will johnson's
[2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:40.520]  whether she's on americanfirst.com we're trying to figure out what went on at this air force base
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:48.520]  in ohio and and i mean no one knows so i haven't heard that a bunch of people have been killed so
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:55.720]  that's certainly good news but but you're right that's what scares them will johnson is that i
[2:48:55.720 --> 2:49:00.600]  inspired other people because i knew that was important you've inspired other people and
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:04.520]  then when they come out and bully people you guys aren't looking for trouble i mean it's
[2:49:04.520 --> 2:49:10.280]  antifa everywhere who will i've had them come up to me like i'm in a restaurant because i know
[2:49:10.280 --> 2:49:14.360]  they're antifa it's always like professors or they're you know they're students and it's always
[2:49:14.360 --> 2:49:19.320]  f u nazi or russian agent and i'm like i'm not a nazi or russian agent and they don't care it's
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:24.360]  like once they say that to you it's their license to be thugs and hateful so what they really are
[2:49:24.360 --> 2:49:28.600]  is a bunch of losers and then they can't believe when they attack somebody they always get their
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:35.800]  ass kicked even they attack a woman and then they bitch and complain and say you attack me it it
[2:49:35.800 --> 2:49:39.800]  it just even liberal media even nancy polosi has to admit they're starting the fights and
[2:49:39.800 --> 2:49:43.480]  attacking people so what do you expect to come up this weekend how do people go there i got a
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:47.720]  bunch of articles actually about what you're doing i meant to cover but then i got busy here it is
[2:49:48.680 --> 2:49:54.280]  portland mayor under fire for pd failure to answer 911 calls from ice office so you're there
[2:49:54.280 --> 2:49:59.080]  right after that happened where they're attacking this food truck because the lady's selling people
[2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:06.280]  that food that come out of the building i mean it's it's it's just crazy there's splc what you
[2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:10.600]  know about the upcoming far right rallies in the pacific northwest oh my gosh these evil
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:18.200]  patriot people it's so sick uh organ far right protest move to location to allow carrying guns
[2:50:18.200 --> 2:50:24.360]  well you guys are known for saying you're not offensively violent but i i really wouldn't
[2:50:24.360 --> 2:50:29.240]  want to be anti for who already got caught with guns clubs and knives a few weeks ago so what are
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:35.960]  you expecting i'm expecting them to come out and act completely insane completely crazy you
[2:50:35.960 --> 2:50:41.720]  know it would be to their interest for them not to even show up if anti for blm bam and all the
[2:50:41.720 --> 2:50:47.080]  rest of the anti-american hate group don't even show up the media won't even cover it it won't even
[2:50:47.080 --> 2:50:52.680]  be a story but see they can't help themselves because they want to intimidate the american people
[2:50:52.680 --> 2:50:57.800]  it's a very reason why they attack a food truck they simply want to provide a service to people to
[2:50:57.800 --> 2:51:04.760]  eat they want to intimidate everybody that they can that loves this country that respects the president
[2:51:04.760 --> 2:51:11.000]  and that loves the truth they can care less about anything that is right that's why you're right
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:14.760]  they're obsessed with not just the platforming this is on the news when they're calling everybody
[2:51:14.760 --> 2:51:20.120]  inward they then run over and like i started tagging a food truck because it's selling food
[2:51:20.120 --> 2:51:24.440]  next to a federal building it just they're obsessed with controlling the means of production
[2:51:24.440 --> 2:51:31.240]  they're communists they want to run it all exactly you're exactly right why is it that
[2:51:31.240 --> 2:51:36.120]  i can go out on the street and hold american flag and people tell me i'm number one as they
[2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:41.320]  ride by or i get people to want to physically attack me because i'm holding the american flag
[2:51:41.320 --> 2:51:47.160]  in the united states of america now if i went to cuba or if i went to north korea or even if
[2:51:47.160 --> 2:51:52.680]  i went to mexico and i would hold up the american flag talking about this is my land or i need right
[2:51:52.680 --> 2:51:58.040]  here they will probably put me in prison and never be seen again for simply holding up an american
[2:51:58.040 --> 2:52:03.480]  flag in these countries and now they're trying to do the same thing here portland is the same thing
[2:52:03.480 --> 2:52:10.920]  berkeley sunday will be the same thing they do not want people to stand freely in any venue or
[2:52:10.920 --> 2:52:16.920]  any place why do it if they like i said a second ago just don't show up the media won't even talk
[2:52:16.920 --> 2:52:21.000]  about it we won't get any attention from the media but because they show up and want to be
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:25.960]  violent and control the narrative and control what people see think and believe that's why they
[2:52:25.960 --> 2:52:29.960]  can't help themselves and that's why they're going to show up to try to harm us we're not trying to
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:34.440]  harm anybody they are the ones that's trying to harm everybody they are the violent ones and it's
[2:52:34.440 --> 2:52:38.920]  been like that from every sense they've the democrats the domestic terrorist democrats have
[2:52:38.920 --> 2:52:43.240]  been doing this to black people for the longest and now here it is they call black people they
[2:52:43.240 --> 2:52:48.200]  inward but see it's okay when they do it the liberals it's okay when they do it but if someone
[2:52:48.200 --> 2:52:52.360]  else doesn't that's when it becomes a whole complete different picture oh you're being
[2:52:52.360 --> 2:52:57.720]  hateful you're being racist which is not true it is the left that is racist they call us what they are
[2:52:58.280 --> 2:53:01.480]  it's unbelievable why can't any of them fight
[2:53:01.480 --> 2:53:09.720]  well that's a really good question i think they sit behind their xbox and their ps4s all day and
[2:53:09.720 --> 2:53:13.720]  like oh look what i'm doing look what i'm doing and then they fix it in their mind that you know
[2:53:13.720 --> 2:53:16.920]  they believe it that they're warriors all of a sudden like i wouldn't go out here and i can
[2:53:16.920 --> 2:53:20.680]  do this and i can do that because they're sitting in mommy and daddy basement all day playing a
[2:53:20.680 --> 2:53:25.160]  video game thinking now they're all of a sudden warriors we don't want to hurt them they are someone's
[2:53:25.160 --> 2:53:30.520]  child there are someone's children that's been deceived by a professor at a liberal college
[2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:35.240]  that have them to believe that the american people the american flag is bad you know what
[2:53:35.240 --> 2:53:41.240]  i love that american flag that american flag is what shows represents freedom for all of us
[2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:46.280]  that flag is the flag that won the civil war that's the reason why i'm able to stand here today and
[2:53:46.280 --> 2:53:52.760]  talk to you because of that flag what it represents and over a million people over a million people
[2:53:52.760 --> 2:53:57.320]  died in the civil war that was we lost more people that war than any other war exactly and
[2:53:57.320 --> 2:54:02.040]  guess what majority of them were white people trying to help black people but see they don't
[2:54:02.040 --> 2:54:05.720]  want to talk about that they want to talk about how white people that they are all of a sudden
[2:54:05.720 --> 2:54:09.560]  the problem which we all know is not true but they have to push this narrative because they
[2:54:09.560 --> 2:54:14.280]  don't have anything they don't even have anything to stand on that's why they still talk about
[2:54:14.280 --> 2:54:18.520]  exactly going back to civil war there were there were bad things on both sides but bottom line
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:24.040]  it was christian abolitionist who in 1800 were one percent of the population who said it was wrong
[2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:29.160]  and then that became the impetus for part of the civil war but regardless there were trade disputes
[2:54:29.160 --> 2:54:34.360]  everything else but slavery was wrong it was christians in europe in england in here that so
[2:54:34.360 --> 2:54:40.440]  we've got to stop it and then they were the people that led the charge and just 68 years later slavery
[2:54:40.440 --> 2:54:44.920]  was banned it didn't mean everything was fixed then but the point was it was christians in america
[2:54:44.920 --> 2:54:49.480]  that fought and died and and they went from one percent to the majority in the north and many of
[2:54:49.480 --> 2:54:54.360]  the south and that shows how we're going to win too just like three percent started the war against
[2:54:54.360 --> 2:54:59.720]  king george doesn't mean we were perfect back then either but he was even worse so it's a progression
[2:54:59.720 --> 2:55:04.600]  as we learn to get more liberty and and america's been more free than the other country so the the
[2:55:04.600 --> 2:55:09.000]  university teaches to hate it they don't teach us any of the good things about the country because
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:15.240]  they are globalist they are against the country you're absolutely right during the civil war and
[2:55:15.240 --> 2:55:19.400]  when they had the underground railroad i always asked people i said who was running the underground
[2:55:19.400 --> 2:55:24.440]  railroad was it black people did they black people own homes back then no it was white people see
[2:55:24.440 --> 2:55:28.120]  they don't want to acknowledge that and when you bring that up they all shut down and then they
[2:55:28.120 --> 2:55:32.520]  start talking about something else they the democrat party the domestic terrorist group in
[2:55:32.520 --> 2:55:38.760]  this country the democratic party they are angry at white republicans and black republicans
[2:55:38.760 --> 2:55:43.000]  from doing everything they could to help black people out in this country and they're still
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:47.640]  doing it they're still doing it today and people still fall for it i don't understand why black
[2:55:47.640 --> 2:55:52.280]  people when you present the truth to them they still just keep going so you know what i want i
[2:55:52.280 --> 2:55:57.560]  want the lie because the lie feels good to them they've been consumed with the hate and they're
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:56:02.040]  not going to let it go because that's what they want they want to believe the lies of the media
[2:56:02.040 --> 2:56:09.480]  see info wars they you guys you always speak the truth and they don't like it and you have to
[2:56:09.480 --> 2:56:16.120]  destroy the truth i mean hitler said it tell a lie and tell it enough and people will believe it
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:20.440]  tell the truth and they will get angry with you that's why the truth always hurts and i know
[2:56:20.440 --> 2:56:23.000]  you're about to get in the car and drive up to portland i want to come out to you five more
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:26.440]  minutes with you about how people can support you how they can come out i don't think that you

[2:56:29.080 --> 2:56:33.320]  watching there's all these lawsuits the police i think this week we'll see if i'm wrong and ask

[3:00:12.520 --> 3:00:18.680]  war room with oan stroyer and roger stones coming up there is just so much insanity going on taking
[3:00:18.680 --> 3:00:26.040]  place right now um just just to watch the left the democrats the globalists looking at the
[3:00:26.040 --> 3:00:30.600]  demographics of the world and then trying to bring in third world populations and indoctrinate them
[3:00:30.600 --> 3:00:35.640]  in classical racism i don't know if you saw this will johnson because usually i ignore this stuff
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:39.800]  because it's just i get really sick of it i mean it hurts my soul and it's not like i'm some perfect
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:44.440]  guy but when you choose humanity choose jesus when everybody come together you don't want to
[3:00:44.440 --> 3:00:49.480]  abort black babies white babies any babies but then you also see people turning to racist enemies
[3:00:49.480 --> 3:00:54.360]  against you and and and because you're white and then you see how they're funding the white
[3:00:54.360 --> 3:00:58.760]  supremacists you see the whole dialectic of how they're playing us off but then you've got this
[3:00:58.760 --> 3:01:03.320]  lady that heads up the new york times now on the board of directors who literally says exterminate
[3:01:03.320 --> 3:01:10.040]  whites they're they're they're idiots they're scum i hate them they're trash white men are the enemy
[3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:13.880]  you know and you can just see and the new york times is on info wars dot com
[3:01:13.880 --> 3:01:20.600]  defending or saying well yeah so they're setting up this thing where like the kkk are a bunch of
[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:24.520]  losers don't even listen to them but with the new york times everything you get around these
[3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:32.520]  leftist these are frothing racist and i don't i don't they're crazy people i don't even know what
[3:01:32.520 --> 3:01:37.240]  they're i don't because i get their method like using race they can control people but
[3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:41.160]  how are they going to normalize and say anybody that's a capitalist is a racist
[3:01:41.720 --> 3:01:47.320]  with no evidence but then they're all racist it's just crazy yeah you know what i've been saying it
[3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:52.920]  for a while that there's an award that there is a war on white people in this country they are
[3:01:52.920 --> 3:01:56.680]  trying to make it to where white people will be out in the streets and they would get hosed down
[3:01:56.680 --> 3:02:03.400]  with water holes and get dogs sicked onto them they are trying to reverse it i've had liberals black
[3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:08.280]  liberals say that white people it's their turn to go through what black people went through
[3:02:08.280 --> 3:02:13.000]  was really crazy about all that these black people that are telling me this never went through that
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:19.720]  themselves they have been taught by the left to hate and demonize white people that's it right
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:24.520]  there in a nutshell they constantly do it they're constantly being taught that
[3:02:24.520 --> 3:02:28.520]  and i agree so what would martin Luther king who got killed for what he believed
[3:02:28.520 --> 3:02:35.240]  what would he think if he woke up from a trance or a sleep like rip van winkle and and like suddenly
[3:02:35.240 --> 3:02:38.680]  the left is like the kkk but i guess he'd get it because he was a republican
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:48.680]  he did not envision this it only took obama 2922 days to pretty much reverse everything
[3:02:48.680 --> 3:02:55.640]  martin luther king did that's all what he did reverse everything we didn't have all this racial
[3:02:55.640 --> 3:03:00.920]  tension when bush was in office it's only took place when obama came martin luther king would
[3:03:00.920 --> 3:03:06.680]  say this is not what i was talking about us being free now you have black people want to go back
[3:03:06.680 --> 3:03:10.600]  into slavery a lot of times when i go to different rallies and i had these black people never
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:16.040]  approached me telling me that white people want to do this to them or white people want to enslave
[3:03:16.040 --> 3:03:20.280]  them i asked him i said you know those shackles that you have on your hands and feet they don't
[3:03:20.280 --> 3:03:26.120]  have any locks you can't take them off and then when you go to take them off them they get upset
[3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:30.440]  with you they get angry and then they'll put the lot the shackles back on and then they're looking
[3:03:30.440 --> 3:03:35.720]  for the locks i don't understand the insanity of these people well let me just say the average white
[3:03:35.720 --> 3:03:41.160]  persons like anybody else they're just watching tv brainwashed and hating themselves i mean the idea
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:45.720]  that white people are in some now but then then the left puts chips on everybody's shoulders and
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:50.120]  everybody's actually nervous around people and then it gets even weirder they know exactly what
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:55.560]  they're doing but i think they're losing exactly they even have white people coming out demonizing
[3:03:55.560 --> 3:04:00.520]  white people that's the white liberal for you that doesn't make any sense i i couldn't believe that i
[3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:05.480]  actually heard another white people talking about yes white people are the problem we need to remove
[3:04:05.480 --> 3:04:10.120]  white people from society white people have held down black people white that white people have
[3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:15.880]  held down brown people all along it's yourself that holds yourself back it's not you can't blame it on
[3:04:15.880 --> 3:04:21.640]  anyone i can't blame it on anybody i have to blame will johnson if my for my failures not anybody
[3:04:21.640 --> 3:04:26.200]  else well definitely in this day and age and people in a network and work together they're always
[3:04:26.200 --> 3:04:30.680]  going to be racist on any side but they're over there there's all other societies and people
[3:04:30.680 --> 3:04:35.080]  that just want to live and so you kind of opt in you're going to be a racist like the left
[3:04:35.080 --> 3:04:38.680]  and like everything's racial or you should be human and then it's like oh we're all friends
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:43.560]  let's all work together and everything works you know if satan went to the dnc to talk about his
[3:04:43.560 --> 3:04:48.440]  policies which policies with the democrats just agree with none of them they would agree with every

[3:07:15.880 --> 3:07:22.040]  trainers asses politically and we're not backing down at her i want to kick these people we're
[3:07:22.040 --> 3:07:34.280]  waiting i can see all the spirit rising can't you we have broken their back yes i can feel it
[3:07:34.280 --> 3:07:40.120]  Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[3:07:43.480 --> 3:07:47.640]  Vengeance is coming! Fire is coming!
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:54.280]  The real revolution against you is coming, and you will burn in hell!
[3:07:57.400 --> 3:08:02.520]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called Infowars.
[3:08:02.520 --> 3:08:06.920]  And in the decade since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution,
[3:08:06.920 --> 3:08:12.040]  with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly,
[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:18.120]  and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[3:08:18.120 --> 3:08:22.280]  Infowars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country,
[3:08:22.280 --> 3:08:26.360]  dedicated to delivering breaking news, live coverage of special events,
[3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:29.400]  and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else.
[3:08:29.400 --> 3:08:33.960]  While the old guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape
[3:08:33.960 --> 3:08:40.040]  brought by innovation and technology, Infowars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[3:08:40.600 --> 3:08:45.240]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers,
[3:08:45.240 --> 3:08:52.040]  or the billions of views of our online content, Infowars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[3:08:53.160 --> 3:08:56.600]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis
[3:08:56.600 --> 3:09:00.120]  for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations,
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:05.720]  accept no substitutes, demand truth, demand Infowars.
[3:09:07.400 --> 3:09:10.120]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:16.440]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones during the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show broadcast.
[3:09:16.440 --> 3:09:22.360]  Thank you for staying with us today. I've got quite a powerful roundup of information for you today,
[3:09:22.360 --> 3:09:28.840]  because it has become apparent to me that censorship is the civil rights issue of our time.
[3:09:28.840 --> 3:09:32.360]  That's why I was so happy to see the guests that Alex just had on,
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:37.320]  who also invoked that same comparison. This is a civil rights issue.
[3:09:37.320 --> 3:09:41.320]  Do we have the right to participate in a civil society?
[3:09:41.320 --> 3:09:45.320]  Do we have the right to speak? Do we have the right even to defend ourselves
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:52.360]  against slander and smears? And no one today is more smeared than Alex Jones is right now.
[3:09:52.360 --> 3:09:58.200]  He is at the top of the list, and what's so malicious about it is that they know they are smearing Alex
[3:09:58.760 --> 3:10:02.440]  deliberately with false information. They know it's false.
[3:10:02.440 --> 3:10:09.800]  They don't even attempt to tell the truth. They are trying to smear Alex with fake, made-up lies.
[3:10:09.800 --> 3:10:14.840]  And I see that as someone who is, you know, I'm not an employee of InfoWars.
[3:10:14.840 --> 3:10:18.680]  I'm not part of the InfoWars organization. I come in and I contribute,
[3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:24.680]  but I've got my own organization. So I'm able to kind of see this as a third-party perspective.
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:32.280]  And what I see them doing to Alex Jones is unbelievably, it is malicious, it's beyond
[3:10:32.680 --> 3:10:39.320]  evil. It is just destructive to our society. If we're going to have a society where we can
[3:10:39.320 --> 3:10:46.120]  have public discourse, where we can engage in debates, where we can even have an institution
[3:10:46.120 --> 3:10:55.480]  called the news, then we have to have the ability of people to talk about basic facts.
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:11:01.320]  And if they accuse Alex of something, why don't they show the video? Why don't they play the audio?
[3:11:01.320 --> 3:11:08.120]  They say Alex Jones attacked some little kid. Where's the video of it? It doesn't exist.
[3:11:08.120 --> 3:11:12.840]  So they have to make it up. They have to fake it. And that's what's so malicious about this.
[3:11:12.840 --> 3:11:18.280]  We are seeing, and what else is interesting is that in their effort to destroy Alex Jones,
[3:11:18.280 --> 3:11:24.680]  the left-wing media is committing suicide. They are destroying their reputation forever.
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:31.880]  Because I don't know about you, but for me, I will never trust anything ever again that CNN says.
[3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:36.440]  I will never trust a single article in the New York Times or the fake news Washington Post.
[3:11:36.440 --> 3:11:41.400]  I know that they are not just accidentally fake, but maliciously deliberately fake.
[3:11:41.400 --> 3:11:45.160]  And so I know that whatever they print about Alex Jones or President Trump,
[3:11:45.160 --> 3:11:49.320]  or even what they print about me, I know it's false. I know it firsthand.
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:55.720]  Because I'm here. I talk to Alex. I see these things. I also see the lies they write about me
[3:11:55.720 --> 3:12:01.720]  or President Trump. So I see it. But I want to plug this book today, not being paid to plug it.
[3:12:01.720 --> 3:12:07.160]  It's called The Russia Hoax. Right here, Greg Jarrett. This is a must-read book.
[3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:10.760]  It is already flying off the shelves at bookstores all across America.
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:16.440]  The Russia Hoax, the illicit scheme to clear Hillary Clinton and frame Donald Trump.
[3:12:16.440 --> 3:12:22.520]  Now, I'm about a third of the way into this book already, and it is mind-blowing. Greg Jarrett lays
[3:12:22.520 --> 3:12:29.960]  out the case of collusion, corruption, their false framing of President Trump,
[3:12:29.960 --> 3:12:37.000]  how they are falsely accusing him, trying to destroy his presidency by accusing him of crimes
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:40.840]  that they made up. And they're doing it. Most importantly, this is what Jarrett
[3:12:40.840 --> 3:12:45.800]  reveals in the book. They're doing it in order to clear Hillary Clinton of the actual crimes
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:52.760]  that she committed. And I think that it is up to us to not just support infowars,
[3:12:52.760 --> 3:12:58.520]  support infowars store, purchase the health enhancing products, but also let's support authors
[3:12:58.520 --> 3:13:03.320]  who are doing this kind of good work. We need to support Greg Jarrett. We need to support
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:09.560]  Tucker Carlson. We need to support even people like Sean Hannity, people who are out there who are
[3:13:10.280 --> 3:13:15.560]  defending or attempting to defend this nation against the lies and smears that are happening
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:20.280]  everywhere, even now inside Fox News. And I'm sure that even Greg Jarrett looks at what's
[3:13:20.280 --> 3:13:27.080]  happening in Fox News and he's disgusted by it, as is Judge Napolitano, who used to have a show
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:32.760]  there, but he was canned because he told too much truth as well. There's a civil war inside Fox News,
[3:13:32.760 --> 3:13:38.040]  but we have to support those inside those organizations like Fox News who are telling
[3:13:38.040 --> 3:13:44.200]  the truth and who are willing to document the lies and write books and go on camera and tell
[3:13:44.200 --> 3:13:49.640]  the truth each and every day in America. So it's not just about supporting Alex Jones and infowars,
[3:13:49.640 --> 3:13:53.640]  it's also about supporting people like Greg Jarrett. And I gotta say Greg, outstanding job
[3:13:53.640 --> 3:13:59.480]  as an author myself. I recognize the amount of work that went into this. It is probably,
[3:13:59.480 --> 3:14:03.160]  you know, a couple thousand hours of work. It's an extraordinary book. I can't recommend it
[3:14:03.160 --> 3:14:10.280]  highly enough. Now coming up in the rest of this show today, as we continue the fourth hour of the
[3:14:10.280 --> 3:14:16.200]  Alex Jones show, I'm going to talk about 3D printed guns. I'm going to tell you some hard truth
[3:14:16.200 --> 3:14:22.120]  about that and why the left wing media is lying about 3D printing of guns. I'm going to comment
[3:14:22.120 --> 3:14:27.080]  on that New York Times editorial board member. I'm going to read you a plea from Jim Hoft
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:32.840]  from the Gateway pundit who says, get ready and pray to God because it's all coming down. The
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:40.840]  final act in the coup d'etat has begun. I'm going to read some headlines from a story. We are the
[3:14:40.840 --> 3:14:47.480]  last line of defense against global government. And also, I'm going to play for you. Actually,
[3:14:47.480 --> 3:14:55.880]  I'm going to perform it for you a dramatization, a dramatization of Twitter engaging in a different
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:15:02.920]  kind of censorship than what they're doing right now. That Twitter dramatization is a fictional
[3:15:02.920 --> 3:15:08.200]  segment. It will be marked as a dramatization, but it will be mind blowing, absolutely shocking.
[3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:14.280]  And it will be stated in the spirit of liberty and freedom and the First Amendment rights and
[3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:20.840]  protections for us all. That is all coming up on the Alex Jones show here today. Also, finally,
[3:15:22.040 --> 3:15:27.720]  I'm going to tell you something about Alex Jones that people seem to have forgotten the gift that
[3:15:27.720 --> 3:15:33.560]  he has given our world in terms of what he actually stands for. Forget the lies from the
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:37.240]  media for a moment. Let's talk about what Alex Jones really stands for. I'm going to bring
[3:15:37.240 --> 3:15:42.520]  you that summary as a third party independent person when we continue here on the Alex Jones
[3:15:42.520 --> 3:15:56.360]  show. Thank you for joining us. Stay with us. You have been lied to. My name is Kevin Ship.

[3:16:02.280 --> 3:16:07.560]  best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever. We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is
[3:16:07.560 --> 3:16:12.280]  now being run and ruled by a shadow government. We got to get this out because just because you're

[3:19:46.200 --> 3:20:06.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:06.200 --> 3:20:33.200]  One of the wonderful things about coming here to the InfoWars studios and filling in from time to time
[3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:41.200]  and having my own show, CounterThink, on Sundays at 6pm on Infowars.com, is knowing that this organization,
[3:20:41.200 --> 3:20:46.200]  I walk around, I look at all the different people here, people of different ethnic backgrounds,
[3:20:46.200 --> 3:20:51.200]  people of different skin color, not that that matters, but there's a lot of diversity in this office,
[3:20:51.200 --> 3:20:57.200]  people of different ideas, people of different religious backgrounds, and perhaps people of different sexual orientations.
[3:20:57.200 --> 3:21:06.200]  I don't know, I don't ask, so it's none of my business. But the thing is that Alex Jones in InfoWars is the true definition
[3:21:06.200 --> 3:21:16.200]  of diversity of ideas and tolerance of individual liberty because here at InfoWars, and I'm not putting words in Alex's mouth,
[3:21:16.200 --> 3:21:23.200]  but I know that he welcomes people of all kinds of backgrounds as long as they are pro-liberty.
[3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:29.200]  That's the key. Alex doesn't judge you by your skin color, your sexual orientation, your religion or lack of religion,
[3:21:29.200 --> 3:21:34.200]  the country of origin, none of that stuff, not by how you look or anything.
[3:21:34.200 --> 3:21:41.200]  Alex judges you the way I do, which is to say, are you pro-liberty? Do you support individual liberty?
[3:21:41.200 --> 3:21:46.200]  Are you rooted in logic and reason and rationality? These are the things that matter.
[3:21:46.200 --> 3:21:51.200]  These are the things, by the way, that people like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called for when he said,
[3:21:51.200 --> 3:21:56.200]  we should judge people by the content of the character, not the color of their skin.
[3:21:56.200 --> 3:22:00.200]  Don't be skin deep. Look into the soul, look into the spirit of people.
[3:22:00.200 --> 3:22:07.200]  And frankly, that is the spirit that I see here at InfoWars. It's not like I can take a camera and walk around and show you everybody
[3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:14.200]  because a lot of people want to be private, understandably, but it's a very fascinating workplace.
[3:22:14.200 --> 3:22:23.200]  And it's in that spirit now. I'm going to read you. This is a dramatization coming up of a fictional announcement
[3:22:23.200 --> 3:22:30.200]  about Twitter and CEO Jack Dorsey. Now, we're going to label this a dramatization when I begin
[3:22:30.200 --> 3:22:37.200]  so that there's no confusion, that this isn't fake news. This is a dramatization of what-if scenario.
[3:22:37.200 --> 3:22:44.200]  And it asks the question, what if Twitter were censoring a different group other than just conservatives?
[3:22:44.200 --> 3:22:49.200]  Because today they censor conservatives and libertarians and they censor people for being Christians.
[3:22:49.200 --> 3:22:55.200]  And we're told by the left that, well, that's okay. Twitter can censor anyone they want because they're a private company.
[3:22:55.200 --> 3:23:00.200]  They can do whatever they want. So I dare ask the question today in the spirit of true diversity,
[3:23:00.200 --> 3:23:07.200]  of true openness to all races, colors, creeds, nationalities, religions, as long as you're pro-liberty,
[3:23:07.200 --> 3:23:12.200]  I ask the question, what would happen if Twitter did the following?
[3:23:12.200 --> 3:23:19.200]  So here we go. Put up that dramatization graphic there. Here we go. This is a dramatization.
[3:23:19.200 --> 3:23:26.200]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced today that Twitter will ban the online speech of all black people.
[3:23:26.200 --> 3:23:31.200]  This says Dorsey is perfectly allowable because Twitter is a, quote, private company.
[3:23:31.200 --> 3:23:37.200]  And according to the current consensus on the left, private companies can, quote, ban anyone they like.
[3:23:37.200 --> 3:23:42.200]  As of today, according to Jack Dorsey, black people can no longer use Twitter.
[3:23:42.200 --> 3:23:46.200]  Black employees at Twitter are no longer allowed to eat at the company cafeteria.
[3:23:46.200 --> 3:23:51.200]  And anyone of dark skin color is being asked to sit in the back of Twitter's offices.
[3:23:51.200 --> 3:23:57.200]  Furthermore, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says that any tweets containing the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[3:23:57.200 --> 3:24:05.200]  will be deemed hate speech because such speeches demand people be judged based on merit rather than superficial qualities.
[3:24:05.200 --> 3:24:13.200]  And the left absolutely despises people being judged based on their earned merit rather than their unearned victim status.
[3:24:13.200 --> 3:24:21.200]  Meritocracy, says Jack Dorsey, is racism. We must protect Twitter users from the kind of meritocracy-based hate speech spoken by,
[3:24:21.200 --> 3:24:25.200]  yes, he said this, people like Dr. Martin Luther King.
[3:24:25.200 --> 3:24:30.200]  He went on to explain that, quote, their kind are not welcomed at Twitter.
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:35.200]  And that as a private company, Twitter has the right to discriminate against people for any reason at all, he says,
[3:24:35.200 --> 3:24:40.200]  because the First Amendment protects Twitter's right to selectively censor voices with whom they disagree.
[3:24:40.200 --> 3:24:45.200]  Black people, explained Dorsey, can simply use other platforms to express themselves.
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:49.200]  We don't have to allow their kind to use the Twitter platform.
[3:24:49.200 --> 3:24:54.200]  Alright, end dramatization. That was a fictional what if.
[3:24:54.200 --> 3:24:59.200]  And I'm invoking this precisely to get you to ask the question,
[3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:10.200]  how big of a civil rights outcry nationwide marches, screaming and rightful attacks on Twitter?
[3:25:10.200 --> 3:25:15.200]  Would there be, if Jack Dorsey had done exactly what I just depicted in that dramatization,
[3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:21.200]  how big of an outcry would there be and should there be if he censored black people,
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:25.200]  or if he censored gays, or if he censored all women?
[3:25:25.200 --> 3:25:29.200]  What if Jack Dorsey said that women are not allowed to post on Twitter anymore,
[3:25:29.200 --> 3:25:31.200]  for whatever reason he wanted to give?
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:36.200]  Would that be okay to the left, because they say that, well, Twitter's a private corporation.
[3:25:36.200 --> 3:25:38.200]  They can censor whatever they want.
[3:25:38.200 --> 3:25:44.200]  What if Google blocks all searches of content authored by lesbians and gays?
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:48.200]  What if Facebook said that women shouldn't have the right to participate in public speech,
[3:25:48.200 --> 3:25:51.200]  because there used to be a day when they couldn't vote?
[3:25:51.200 --> 3:25:55.200]  What if YouTube declared Christianity to be hate speech?
[3:25:55.200 --> 3:25:59.200]  Oh, wait, they've already done that.
[3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:03.200]  This dramatization is designed to invoke discussion and debate
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:06.200]  on what I believe is the biggest civil rights issue of our time.
[3:26:06.200 --> 3:26:14.200]  And I offer this dramatization in the spirit of knowing that we welcome African-Americans,
[3:26:14.200 --> 3:26:15.200]  gays and lesbians.
[3:26:15.200 --> 3:26:19.200]  We welcome people of any religious background, of any nationality.
[3:26:19.200 --> 3:26:23.200]  We welcome you to join the fight for liberty, for the First Amendment,
[3:26:23.200 --> 3:26:28.200]  and we support you, and we celebrate your efforts.
[3:26:28.200 --> 3:26:32.200]  While the left talks about diversity, they crush it.
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:36.200]  Look at this, New York Times, new editorial board member.
[3:26:36.200 --> 3:26:41.200]  I don't have her name in front of me, but she says that whites are horrible evil people
[3:26:41.200 --> 3:26:43.200]  who need to live in caves.
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:45.200]  What did she say that they need to be?
[3:26:45.200 --> 3:26:50.200]  Here it is, they're only fit to live underground like groveling goblins?
[3:26:50.200 --> 3:26:52.200]  She says she's working for the New York Times.
[3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:58.200]  She despises white people, and it's New York Times and other mainstream media outlets
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:02.200]  that call Alex Jones, you know, racist or discriminatory.
[3:27:02.200 --> 3:27:06.200]  And Alex Jones supports people of every color, of every religion,
[3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:10.200]  of every background, as long as you support liberty for God's sake.
[3:27:10.200 --> 3:27:13.200]  And that's what this Twitter dramatization is all about.
[3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:15.200]  I want to get this point across.
[3:27:15.200 --> 3:27:21.200]  We are here to fight for all of humanity, regardless of what you look like,
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:23.200]  regardless of your skin color.
[3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:26.200]  We are here to fight for your right to speak, and your right to exist,
[3:27:26.200 --> 3:27:32.200]  and your right to participate in the public spaces of conversation and debate.
[3:27:32.200 --> 3:27:36.200]  And the very reason why I had to put the word dramatization across that,
[3:27:36.200 --> 3:27:41.200]  if you're watching, on Infowars.com, is because I know that the fake news left-wing media
[3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:43.200]  will try to take that out of context.
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:45.200]  But you'll notice, by the way, it was also written and read in a way
[3:27:45.200 --> 3:27:49.200]  that they could not claim that I was saying to ban black people.
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:55.200]  No, that's Jack Dorsey in that dramatization claiming that black people should be banned.
[3:27:55.200 --> 3:27:57.200]  I mean, imagine the outcry if that happened.
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:00.200]  That's the kind of outcry that we should be mounting, all of us.
[3:28:00.200 --> 3:28:03.200]  Black, white, Latino, Asian, all of us.
[3:28:03.200 --> 3:28:06.200]  We're all on team humanity here, okay?
[3:28:06.200 --> 3:28:09.200]  And I look around the Infowars office, it's team humanity everywhere.
[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:14.200]  We are all fighting for the freedom of individuals to stand up and speak
[3:28:14.200 --> 3:28:18.200]  and to engage in debate and to even vote and have your vote count
[3:28:18.200 --> 3:28:22.200]  so that there's an election outcome that isn't overturned by a bunch of crooks.
[3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:24.200]  Like Robert Mueller outlined in this book,
[3:28:24.200 --> 3:28:27.200]  the Russia hoax, you gotta read this book by Greg Jarrett.
[3:28:27.200 --> 3:28:29.200]  It nails it.
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:33.200]  Humanity is under attack, and it's Infowars that is defending humanity
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:37.200]  against these assaults that are rooted in incredible evil, intolerance,
[3:28:37.200 --> 3:28:40.200]  and discrimination from every angle.
[3:28:40.200 --> 3:28:42.200]  You want the truth about defending humanity?
[3:28:42.200 --> 3:28:44.200]  You got it, right here, Infowars.com.
[3:28:44.200 --> 3:29:07.200]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[3:29:25.200 --> 3:29:27.200]  Why take another pill?
[3:29:27.200 --> 3:29:31.200]  Many people use our Sunny Bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[3:29:31.200 --> 3:29:34.200]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer
[3:29:34.200 --> 3:29:36.200]  can take its toll on your body.
[3:29:36.200 --> 3:29:39.200]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[3:29:39.200 --> 3:29:44.200]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.

[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:20.200]  You are the Infowar.
[3:30:20.200 --> 3:30:22.200]  And now because of their intensifying censorship,
[3:30:22.200 --> 3:30:27.200]  it's more important than ever that everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[3:30:27.200 --> 3:30:31.200]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us

[3:32:56.200 --> 3:33:05.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:05.200 --> 3:33:19.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:33:19.200 --> 3:33:25.200]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[3:33:25.200 --> 3:33:29.200]  Is the left-wing monopolist media the enemy of the people?
[3:33:29.200 --> 3:33:40.200]  That's the question of our day, and today Sarah Sanders refuses to say that the press is not the enemy of the people
[3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:43.200]  in a, quote, jaw-dropping clash with Jim Acosta.
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:44.200]  Well, I agree.
[3:33:44.200 --> 3:33:47.200]  CNN is clearly the enemy of the people.
[3:33:47.200 --> 3:33:54.200]  CNN is complicit in whipping up the kind of hatred and derangement that has already led to over 500 violent attacks
[3:33:54.200 --> 3:34:00.200]  on Trump supporters across America, documented attacks, and is leading to a kind of civil war.
[3:34:00.200 --> 3:34:02.200]  I mean, did you see that video from yesterday?
[3:34:02.200 --> 3:34:11.200]  Some woman engaged in a Trump derangement vehicular assault on a guy because he had a Trump sticker on the back of his vehicle.
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:14.200]  Of course, CNN is the enemy of the people, and let's not pretend.
[3:34:14.200 --> 3:34:16.200]  CNN doesn't represent America.
[3:34:16.200 --> 3:34:23.200]  CNN represents anti-American forces that want to see America overrun, overthrown, destroyed from within.
[3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:25.200]  They want to see a civil war.
[3:34:25.200 --> 3:34:29.200]  And that relates to this article from Jim Hoft at the Gateway Pundit today.
[3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:31.200]  I'm going to read some excerpts from this.
[3:34:31.200 --> 3:34:32.200]  This is huge.
[3:34:32.200 --> 3:34:35.200]  Get ready and pray to God, says Jim Hoft.
[3:34:35.200 --> 3:34:37.200]  The time is now.
[3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:41.200]  The imposters are preparing the final act in their coup d'etat.
[3:34:41.200 --> 3:34:47.200]  There's some highlights here that I've just got to share with you to all TGP readers and all American patriots.
[3:34:47.200 --> 3:34:50.200]  This is written by Jim Hoft, okay?
[3:34:50.200 --> 3:34:52.200]  We are informing you to prepare yourselves.
[3:34:52.200 --> 3:34:54.200]  The country is at a precipice.
[3:34:54.200 --> 3:34:58.200]  America is either going to be overrun by a power-hungry deep state,
[3:34:58.200 --> 3:35:02.200]  or it will survive one of the biggest attacks to its existence since the civil war.
[3:35:02.200 --> 3:35:06.200]  We must be vigilant and prepared, he writes.
[3:35:06.200 --> 3:35:10.200]  The acts of the deep state are as appalling as they are criminal.
[3:35:10.200 --> 3:35:17.200]  An unelected and elected power-hungry minority is attempting a coup d'etat of the Trump administration.
[3:35:17.200 --> 3:35:21.200]  He writes, skipping on to kind of tighten this up here.
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:25.200]  He says, a small group of evil, unelected officials, known as the deep state,
[3:35:25.200 --> 3:35:31.200]  were given the reins of the U.S. Justice System, State Department, and Intelligence agencies.
[3:35:31.200 --> 3:35:34.200]  We have now reached that moment.
[3:35:34.200 --> 3:35:42.200]  America will be free, or it will become another failing exercise in the chronicles of human history.
[3:35:42.200 --> 3:35:47.200]  The hopes of the deep state actors lie in winning the upcoming 2018 election,
[3:35:47.200 --> 3:35:52.200]  and they can impeach a man for no other reason than he is not one of them.
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:57.200]  Perhaps no time since the civil war has the country reached this pivotal point,
[3:35:57.200 --> 3:36:03.200]  the founders predicted a time like this, he writes, when they created the Second Amendment.
[3:36:03.200 --> 3:36:06.200]  Prepare yourselves and pray.
[3:36:06.200 --> 3:36:12.200]  Ask for another miracle to keep America the shining beacon on a hill.
[3:36:12.200 --> 3:36:17.200]  That's from Jim Hoft at the Gateway Pundit, and I would only add to that this appeal
[3:36:17.200 --> 3:36:24.200]  to President Trump and his advisors or staffers who might be watching.
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:30.200]  Whatever you have to do, President Trump, to expose this deep state and clean these swamp creatures out of Washington,
[3:36:30.200 --> 3:36:35.200]  whatever, if you need to declassify documents, if you need to fire Jeff Sessions, fire Rod Rosenstein,
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:44.200]  if you need to declassify multiple documents regarding the prosecution that should be taking place on Hillary Clinton,
[3:36:44.200 --> 3:36:49.200]  whatever you need to do, we have your back.
[3:36:49.200 --> 3:36:56.200]  And I'm not sure this has been stated so clearly, but I thought today as I was driving in that President Trump might be wondering
[3:36:56.200 --> 3:37:02.200]  how much do the American people have his back if he starts to declassify these documents and fire traders
[3:37:02.200 --> 3:37:05.200]  and the Benedict Arnold of Jeff Sessions.
[3:37:05.200 --> 3:37:13.200]  He knows that there will be left-wing riots in 20-plus major cities all across America, that the left will go berserk,
[3:37:13.200 --> 3:37:20.200]  that they will go insane, they will set fire to buildings, they will commit atrocities of violence,
[3:37:20.200 --> 3:37:28.200]  they will attack Trump supporters, they will burn cars and buildings and maybe bomb government buildings as they've done in the past.
[3:37:28.200 --> 3:37:36.200]  There will be mass riots all over America, but I say, President Trump, and this is me, Mike Adams speaking,
[3:37:36.200 --> 3:37:41.200]  I'm not speaking on behalf of InfoWars with this statement or I can't even say Alex Jones' view on this,
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:45.200]  this is me as an independent citizen, I'm the author of the Adams Report that you've read,
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:54.200]  I say that we the people have your back and we will meet those violent anti-American protesters block by block across America
[3:37:54.200 --> 3:38:02.200]  and we will do so with every legal means, every constitutionally protected means that we have at our disposal
[3:38:02.200 --> 3:38:08.200]  to defend our president, to defend our nation, to defend our constitutional republic
[3:38:08.200 --> 3:38:14.200]  and to defend our right to exist and to participate in a civil society.
[3:38:14.200 --> 3:38:21.200]  So President Trump, if you need to take drastic action to declassify materials so that we the people can see them,
[3:38:21.200 --> 3:38:26.200]  we need to see what's in that FISA warrant, we need to see how this leads back to President,
[3:38:26.200 --> 3:38:31.200]  former President Barack Obama, we need to see the complicity of Robert Mueller,
[3:38:31.200 --> 3:38:38.200]  James Comey, John Brennan, James Clapper, Andrew McCabe, Loretta Lynch, it's a long list,
[3:38:38.200 --> 3:38:42.200]  we need to see that, the American people deserve to see it and we will defend you,
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:48.200]  we will go to bat for you President Trump, no matter what it takes, we are all in to defend this nation.
[3:38:48.200 --> 3:38:53.200]  Now we will not instigate violence, we will not be aggressive in violence,
[3:38:53.200 --> 3:39:00.200]  we will be defensive, but we will be firm and we will defend this nation with every legal means
[3:39:00.200 --> 3:39:04.200]  and every constitutionally protected means that we have available to us today,
[3:39:04.200 --> 3:39:09.200]  which of course includes, as Jim Hoff said, the Second Amendment.
[3:39:09.200 --> 3:39:17.200]  And we will do so in support of law and order, in support of law enforcement, in support of our constitution.
[3:39:17.200 --> 3:39:21.200]  That's extraordinary, what it has come to.
[3:39:21.200 --> 3:39:27.200]  You know, I never imagined that I would even be here doing this, by the way.
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:31.200]  You might know me more as a food scientist, you know, the health ranger.
[3:39:31.200 --> 3:39:37.200]  I thought I was going to be in a lab working on pesticide quantitation analysis with mass spec equipment.
[3:39:37.200 --> 3:39:42.200]  I mean, my dream, before all this censorship and all these attacks on our right to exist,
[3:39:42.200 --> 3:39:49.200]  my dream was to go to the grocery store, buy a thousand products, test the pesticides, herbicides and glyphosate
[3:39:49.200 --> 3:39:54.200]  in all those thousand products and publish those numbers publicly to help promote safe food.
[3:39:54.200 --> 3:40:00.200]  Clean food, food that could support, you know, healthy children and healthy cognitive function.
[3:40:00.200 --> 3:40:02.200]  That was my goal, that's all I want to do.
[3:40:02.200 --> 3:40:06.200]  I just want to be in my lab testing food and helping people live healthy lives.
[3:40:06.200 --> 3:40:14.200]  And yet, here I am, and Alex in a similar way, driven to this point where we have to become warriors.
[3:40:14.200 --> 3:40:21.200]  We have to become warriors because we are cornered into the point where they want to destroy us.
[3:40:21.200 --> 3:40:24.200]  They're trying to destroy our president, they're trying to destroy our society.
[3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:26.200]  And frankly, the lab tests can wait.
[3:40:26.200 --> 3:40:37.200]  Because what good is it to have a laboratory if you're living in a society where we're all slaves to an authoritarian tyranny run by communist China
[3:40:37.200 --> 3:40:43.200]  that has infiltrated our universities and infiltrated Hollywood and infiltrated Congress for that matter,
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:50.200]  where we're being overrun by violent deranged lunatic communists wearing black hoodies and black masks
[3:40:50.200 --> 3:40:52.200]  and committing mass violence against us.
[3:40:52.200 --> 3:40:55.200]  What good does it do to know whether your food is clean?
[3:40:55.200 --> 3:40:57.200]  You see what I mean? We've got to have priorities.
[3:40:57.200 --> 3:41:01.200]  And my priority right now is to be right here and to be fighting for this.
[3:41:01.200 --> 3:41:04.200]  And I'm building alternative platforms.
[3:41:04.200 --> 3:41:07.200]  Real.video, it's been live now for a month.
[3:41:07.200 --> 3:41:12.200]  Infowars now has uploaded over 400 videos to that platform, Real.video.
[3:41:12.200 --> 3:41:19.200]  250 new channels a day, a million video minutes viewed in the last seven days on Real.video.
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:22.200]  And it's growing right now by about 10 to 15% per week.
[3:41:22.200 --> 3:41:24.200]  It is exploding.
[3:41:24.200 --> 3:41:26.200]  So this is the mission that I've had to do.
[3:41:26.200 --> 3:41:28.200]  We have to build alternative platforms.
[3:41:28.200 --> 3:41:32.200]  We have to write white papers like the Adams Report.
[3:41:32.200 --> 3:41:34.200]  We have to fight for our freedom.
[3:41:34.200 --> 3:41:38.200]  We have to support Infowars and Infowars Store.
[3:41:38.200 --> 3:41:43.200]  You've got to support all of these efforts because now we are fighting for everything.
[3:41:43.200 --> 3:41:46.200]  As Jim Hoff said, get ready and pray to God.
[3:41:46.200 --> 3:41:48.200]  Those are his words. The time is now.
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:53.200]  The imposters are preparing the final act in their coup d'etat against America.
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:55.200]  This is absolutely right.
[3:41:55.200 --> 3:41:57.200]  And we see that happening.
[3:41:57.200 --> 3:41:58.200]  And that's why I'm here.
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:41:59.200]  And that's why you're listening.
[3:41:59.200 --> 3:42:01.200]  And that's why you support this broadcast.
[3:42:01.200 --> 3:42:03.200]  And that's why we all know that everything is at stake.
[3:42:03.200 --> 3:42:07.200]  And that's why we're willing to stand up and meet these anti-American forces
[3:42:07.200 --> 3:42:11.200]  block by block all across America to defend our president.
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:13.200]  So I say, do not back down.
[3:42:13.200 --> 3:42:17.200]  Do not instigate violence, but always seek to end it.
[3:42:17.200 --> 3:42:19.200]  Seek to end violence.
[3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:21.200]  Seek to restore law and order.
[3:42:21.200 --> 3:42:24.200]  Seek to restore civility in the streets of our country.
[3:42:24.200 --> 3:42:27.200]  Restore our constitution. Restore our democracy.
[3:42:27.200 --> 3:42:30.200]  Because they are trying to steal these midterm elections.
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:34.200]  The tech giants are committing massive election fraud right now every single day.
[3:42:34.200 --> 3:42:37.200]  Online. It is a criminal racket.
[3:42:37.200 --> 3:42:40.200]  They should be prosecuted under the RICO Act.
[3:42:40.200 --> 3:42:42.200]  I'll talk about that more when we get back.
[3:42:42.200 --> 3:42:45.200]  One more segment still remaining here on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:52.200]  This is Mike Adams filling in. Stay with us.

[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:00.200]  Thanks for holding.
[3:46:00.200 --> 3:46:01.200]  Hey, Alex, mate.
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:05.200]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[3:46:05.200 --> 3:46:10.200]  Back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen,
[3:46:10.200 --> 3:46:13.200]  and it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet,
[3:46:13.200 --> 3:46:15.200]  and I thought it was pretty cool, and read all the books,
[3:46:15.200 --> 3:46:18.200]  and seen all the DVDs, and followed all your guests,
[3:46:18.200 --> 3:46:22.200]  and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield,
[3:46:22.200 --> 3:46:26.200]  and since then, I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality Decay Man,
[3:46:26.200 --> 3:46:29.200]  the Real Red Pill, micro-ZX body.
[3:46:29.200 --> 3:46:30.200]  It's all amazing.
[3:46:30.200 --> 3:46:31.200]  Thank you, brother.
[3:46:31.200 --> 3:46:34.200]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[3:46:34.200 --> 3:46:37.200]  you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body,
[3:46:37.200 --> 3:46:40.200]  you're detoxing the spirit, and it's just the more you know God,
[3:46:40.200 --> 3:46:43.200]  the more you fear God, but the more you chase God,
[3:46:43.200 --> 3:46:47.200]  and I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you,
[3:46:47.200 --> 3:47:05.200]  the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 Worldwide.
[3:47:17.200 --> 3:47:25.200]  Mission Impossible here at InfoWars.
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:29.200]  This is Mike Adams filling in for the fourth hour here on the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:29.200 --> 3:47:31.200]  Thank you for staying with us.
[3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:33.200]  I put out an alert yesterday.
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:36.200]  I'm very, very concerned about this weekend.
[3:47:36.200 --> 3:47:41.200]  I see it as a perfect storm for a possible sort of a mishmash
[3:47:41.200 --> 3:47:45.200]  of attempted false flag attacks to blame conservative Americans.
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:47.200]  It's not 100% prediction.
[3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:48.200]  I don't have a crystal ball.
[3:47:48.200 --> 3:47:51.200]  I just see that things are lined up.
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:52.200]  The rhetoric is lining up.
[3:47:52.200 --> 3:47:54.200]  You've got the midterm elections coming up.
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:47:55.200]  They need another Charlottesville.
[3:47:55.200 --> 3:47:59.200]  They need, when I say they, I mean the anti-American globalists,
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:04.200]  they need to have somebody drive another car into a group of, frankly,
[3:48:04.200 --> 3:48:07.200]  left-wing people so that they can blame conservatives.
[3:48:07.200 --> 3:48:11.200]  I'm not predicting that that's what's going to happen, but it could.
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:16.200]  It's like this weekend seems to be just the mass hysteria of the left
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:18.200]  is peaking right now.
[3:48:18.200 --> 3:48:19.200]  I mean, maybe it'll go even higher.
[3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:20.200]  I don't know.
[3:48:20.200 --> 3:48:23.200]  Maybe if they get Judge Kavanaugh in on the Supreme Court,
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:27.200]  then heads will literally explode all across California.
[3:48:27.200 --> 3:48:28.200]  I'm not sure.
[3:48:28.200 --> 3:48:31.200]  But this weekend, I see the potential for violence.
[3:48:31.200 --> 3:48:32.200]  We hope it doesn't happen.
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:33.200]  We pray for your safety.
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:36.200]  I just want to tell you, if you're an InfoWars listener,
[3:48:36.200 --> 3:48:41.200]  do go out and be a peaceful part of these events.
[3:48:41.200 --> 3:48:42.200]  Support the proud boys.
[3:48:42.200 --> 3:48:44.200]  Support the peaceful prayer groups.
[3:48:44.200 --> 3:48:46.200]  Support pro-America groups.
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:51.200]  Do not initiate violence, but defend yourselves against the violence
[3:48:51.200 --> 3:48:53.200]  and aggression that is being used against you
[3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:57.200]  by radical left-wing Antifa groups and other similar groups.
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:49:00.200]  And I understand that Owen Schreuer and others from InfoWars
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:04.200]  are going to be on site in Portland, Oregon.
[3:49:04.200 --> 3:49:06.200]  We'll be documenting the situation there.
[3:49:06.200 --> 3:49:08.200]  So maybe just their presence with cameras
[3:49:08.200 --> 3:49:10.200]  will kind of tend to calm things down,
[3:49:10.200 --> 3:49:12.200]  because as we know about false flag events,
[3:49:12.200 --> 3:49:16.200]  they don't like false flags to be documented on video.
[3:49:16.200 --> 3:49:19.200]  So perhaps if they had a plan, maybe they'll delay a plan
[3:49:19.200 --> 3:49:22.200]  or maybe they'll do it in another city or another day.
[3:49:22.200 --> 3:49:23.200]  We hope nothing happens.
[3:49:23.200 --> 3:49:25.200]  We hope there's no violence.
[3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:28.200]  But we're also tired of being steamrolled in this country.
[3:49:28.200 --> 3:49:30.200]  We're going to stand up for our rights, our First Amendment,
[3:49:30.200 --> 3:49:33.200]  our Second Amendment, our President, our Republic.
[3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:37.200]  And I encourage you to join us in those peaceful protests
[3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:41.200]  all across America as we stand for our country.
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:45.200]  Let's talk about 3D printed guns for a second here.
[3:49:45.200 --> 3:49:49.200]  So the left is going insane with, of course, the usual lies
[3:49:49.200 --> 3:49:53.200]  saying that, oh my God, people can print guns that are undetectable.
[3:49:53.200 --> 3:49:57.200]  So we have to have new laws that ban undetectable plastic guns
[3:49:57.200 --> 3:49:59.200]  printed on 3D printers.
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:04.200]  Okay, so it almost goes without saying, but anti-gun people
[3:50:04.200 --> 3:50:06.200]  are complete morons when it comes to guns.
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:09.200]  They have no idea how guns work.
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:12.200]  They also don't know anything about the laws or history,
[3:50:12.200 --> 3:50:16.200]  because manufacturing an undetectable gun has been illegal
[3:50:16.200 --> 3:50:18.200]  in America since 1988.
[3:50:18.200 --> 3:50:22.200]  I think the name of it was the Undetectable Firearm Act,
[3:50:22.200 --> 3:50:24.200]  or some similar version of that.
[3:50:24.200 --> 3:50:28.200]  It is illegal now to manufacture an undetectable gun.
[3:50:28.200 --> 3:50:30.200]  So that's already illegal.
[3:50:30.200 --> 3:50:34.200]  And secondly, you can't print, you can't 3D print a gun
[3:50:34.200 --> 3:50:37.200]  that works other than to blow up in your face,
[3:50:37.200 --> 3:50:40.200]  because you have to add metal parts,
[3:50:40.200 --> 3:50:43.200]  because you have chamber pressures in the chamber.
[3:50:43.200 --> 3:50:47.200]  You pull the trigger, the firing pin, hits the primer on the round.
[3:50:47.200 --> 3:50:50.200]  Let's say like a 556 round and an AR-15.
[3:50:50.200 --> 3:50:53.200]  You realize the chamber pressures of that would just completely explode
[3:50:53.200 --> 3:50:56.200]  and destroy any kind of polymer or plastic that you could print
[3:50:56.200 --> 3:50:59.200]  on a 3D printer. You can't print an AR-15.
[3:50:59.200 --> 3:51:03.200]  And these left-wing people, they are idiots when it comes to guns.
[3:51:03.200 --> 3:51:05.200]  They don't know how guns work.
[3:51:05.200 --> 3:51:07.200]  I guess they think they work by magic.
[3:51:07.200 --> 3:51:10.200]  No, it's physics. There's a fast-burning powder.
[3:51:10.200 --> 3:51:11.200]  It creates pressure.
[3:51:11.200 --> 3:51:14.200]  The pressure accelerates the bullet down the rifled barrel.
[3:51:14.200 --> 3:51:16.200]  It's all physics.
[3:51:16.200 --> 3:51:18.200]  And it turns out that when you print a plastic gun
[3:51:18.200 --> 3:51:21.200]  and you try to fire off like a 308 round in it,
[3:51:21.200 --> 3:51:24.200]  or a 556 round, it blows up in your face.
[3:51:24.200 --> 3:51:29.200]  So there is no danger from people having 3D printed guns.
[3:51:29.200 --> 3:51:34.200]  And besides, it is legal to manufacture your own gun right now
[3:51:34.200 --> 3:51:37.200]  using metal parts. That's legal.
[3:51:37.200 --> 3:51:40.200]  Federal government has issued many, many decisions on that.
[3:51:40.200 --> 3:51:43.200]  That's legal right now. You can make your own gun.
[3:51:43.200 --> 3:51:45.200]  You can go get a ghost gunner machine.
[3:51:45.200 --> 3:51:48.200]  You can buy an 80% AR receiver,
[3:51:48.200 --> 3:51:51.200]  and you can use that machine like a little CNC machine,
[3:51:51.200 --> 3:51:55.200]  and you can grind out the metal, and you can fill in the parts,
[3:51:55.200 --> 3:51:58.200]  put in the trigger kit, put in the bolt carrier group,
[3:51:58.200 --> 3:52:00.200]  all that stuff. You can make your own gun.
[3:52:00.200 --> 3:52:02.200]  That's legal right now. That's legal.
[3:52:02.200 --> 3:52:06.200]  And this idea that now suddenly that you shouldn't be able
[3:52:06.200 --> 3:52:11.200]  to post computer code online, that that should be illegal,
[3:52:11.200 --> 3:52:14.200]  that is insane, because that's an attack on the First Amendment.
[3:52:14.200 --> 3:52:17.200]  Because computer code is speech, okay?
[3:52:17.200 --> 3:52:19.200]  Let's be clear about this. Computer code is speech.
[3:52:19.200 --> 3:52:23.200]  Even if you post instructions online or you wrote a book,
[3:52:23.200 --> 3:52:25.200]  let's say like the Anarchist Cookbook,
[3:52:25.200 --> 3:52:29.200]  that even instructs people how to make, you know, explosive materials,
[3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:34.200]  there are many, many uses for that besides any kind of a terrorist use.
[3:52:34.200 --> 3:52:37.200]  And that's why the Anarchist Cookbook or other books,
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:40.200]  the Free Speech writes of people to post information
[3:52:40.200 --> 3:52:43.200]  that even gives instructions for how to build guns
[3:52:43.200 --> 3:52:46.200]  that has to be protected under First Amendment protections.
[3:52:46.200 --> 3:52:49.200]  You see? And the legal argument is very strong for that.
[3:52:49.200 --> 3:52:51.200]  There's no question about it.
[3:52:51.200 --> 3:52:55.200]  And granted, somebody could download plans for how to build a bomb
[3:52:55.200 --> 3:52:57.200]  and they could bomb, you know, a government building.
[3:52:57.200 --> 3:53:01.200]  But that's likely to be Antifa. That's likely to be leftists.
[3:53:01.200 --> 3:53:04.200]  And their problem is that they're deranged lunatics
[3:53:04.200 --> 3:53:07.200]  because of fake news CNN, which is the enemy of the people,
[3:53:07.200 --> 3:53:09.200]  driving people into acts of terrorism.
[3:53:09.200 --> 3:53:11.200]  The problem is not the online plans.
[3:53:11.200 --> 3:53:15.200]  The problem is the fake news media driving people insane
[3:53:15.200 --> 3:53:18.200]  and turning normal people into terrorists.
[3:53:18.200 --> 3:53:19.200]  Do you understand?
[3:53:19.200 --> 3:53:21.200]  The problem is not 3D printed guns.
[3:53:21.200 --> 3:53:24.200]  The problem is mass brainwashing and indoctrination
[3:53:24.200 --> 3:53:27.200]  of the gullible masses on the left
[3:53:27.200 --> 3:53:30.200]  who have already been indoctrinated into the school system
[3:53:30.200 --> 3:53:32.200]  where they're taught communist ideas
[3:53:32.200 --> 3:53:35.200]  and they're taught things that are dangerous to a civil society.
[3:53:35.200 --> 3:53:37.200]  When those people get a hold of equipment,
[3:53:37.200 --> 3:53:41.200]  they will use it to murder or cause chaos or cause violence,
[3:53:41.200 --> 3:53:44.200]  but they can just go out and buy a gun.
[3:53:44.200 --> 3:53:47.200]  They don't need to make a gun. They can buy a gun.
[3:53:47.200 --> 3:53:50.200]  And if they choose to use those guns
[3:53:50.200 --> 3:53:53.200]  to commit violence and crimes in America,
[3:53:53.200 --> 3:53:56.200]  then there's going to be a Second Amendment response, by the way.
[3:53:56.200 --> 3:53:58.200]  Just saying on the record, that's what's going to happen.
[3:53:58.200 --> 3:54:02.200]  So 3D printed guns are not the problem.
[3:54:02.200 --> 3:54:05.200]  3D printed guns or the gun plans for how to make a gun
[3:54:05.200 --> 3:54:07.200]  or how to print a gun,
[3:54:07.200 --> 3:54:11.200]  those are constitutionally protected forms of free speech.
[3:54:11.200 --> 3:54:14.200]  And in fact, I have a lot of 3D printers
[3:54:14.200 --> 3:54:17.200]  and I've got CAD, CAM, design systems,
[3:54:17.200 --> 3:54:20.200]  and I've actually designed parts for a food grow system.
[3:54:20.200 --> 3:54:23.200]  It's called the Food Rising Mini Farm Grow System.
[3:54:23.200 --> 3:54:26.200]  We've sold a few thousand of those over the years.
[3:54:26.200 --> 3:54:28.200]  We actually print our own 3D printed parts.
[3:54:28.200 --> 3:54:30.200]  So I know quite a bit about 3D printers
[3:54:30.200 --> 3:54:32.200]  and I've got to tell you,
[3:54:32.200 --> 3:54:37.200]  I would never try to put a cartridge inside a piece of polymer
[3:54:37.200 --> 3:54:40.200]  that I printed on my printer and pull the trigger on that.
[3:54:40.200 --> 3:54:42.200]  You know, you would blow up your face.
[3:54:42.200 --> 3:54:44.200]  By the way, not a good scene.
[3:54:44.200 --> 3:54:48.200]  Maybe we should allow Antifa to build 3D printed guns
[3:54:48.200 --> 3:54:51.200]  and try them because maybe they're so stupid about guns.
[3:54:51.200 --> 3:54:54.200]  They think they'll work so they'll have these big plastic ARs.
[3:54:54.200 --> 3:54:56.200]  They look like AR-15s.
[3:54:56.200 --> 3:54:59.200]  They only work once and they blow up in your face.
[3:54:59.200 --> 3:55:01.200]  So yeah, go ahead, try that.
[3:55:01.200 --> 3:55:04.200]  If you're that stupid, win the Darwin Award for America.
[3:55:04.200 --> 3:55:05.200]  Thank you.
[3:55:05.200 --> 3:55:07.200]  Okay, all right.
[3:55:07.200 --> 3:55:09.200]  Another news item here to go through.
[3:55:09.200 --> 3:55:12.200]  I want to just talk, we've only got a couple minutes left here,
[3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:16.200]  but I want to get into the insanity of what they're claiming.
[3:55:16.200 --> 3:55:21.200]  Now, celebrities claim that they want Trump supporters euthanized.
[3:55:21.200 --> 3:55:23.200]  This is from a data caller story.
[3:55:23.200 --> 3:55:26.200]  Trump supporters want,
[3:55:26.200 --> 3:55:32.200]  a PBS and NPR contributor says that Trump supporters should be euthanized.
[3:55:32.200 --> 3:55:34.200]  I mean, think about this.
[3:55:34.200 --> 3:55:38.200]  Reporters, celebs call Trump supporters Nazis and KKK want them euthanized
[3:55:38.200 --> 3:55:39.200]  after a Trump rally.
[3:55:39.200 --> 3:55:42.200]  This is on top of the New York Times editorial board member
[3:55:42.200 --> 3:55:46.200]  who goes on this racist rampage saying that white people are, quote,
[3:55:46.200 --> 3:55:50.200]  only fit to live underground like groveling goblins.
[3:55:50.200 --> 3:55:54.200]  And you know, I've seen goblins and they're pretty much leftists.
[3:55:54.200 --> 3:55:57.200]  There was a goblin that attacked Alex Jones on the sidewalk a couple years ago.
[3:55:57.200 --> 3:55:59.200]  That was an actual goblin.
[3:55:59.200 --> 3:56:02.200]  It was like right out of Lord of the Rings, man.
[3:56:02.200 --> 3:56:05.200]  It's like, were you born out of the mud slime 15 minutes ago?
[3:56:05.200 --> 3:56:07.200]  Where'd you find those blue jeans?
[3:56:07.200 --> 3:56:09.200]  How'd you, how'd you get onto the sidewalk here?
[3:56:09.200 --> 3:56:10.200]  That's amazing.
[3:56:10.200 --> 3:56:13.200]  You went from goblin to like half human in record time.
[3:56:13.200 --> 3:56:14.200]  That's amazing.
[3:56:14.200 --> 3:56:17.200]  So, so she says that all white people are goblins and the New York Times
[3:56:17.200 --> 3:56:19.200]  doesn't have a problem with that.
[3:56:19.200 --> 3:56:20.200]  They think that's fine.
[3:56:20.200 --> 3:56:25.200]  So if you're a racist, bigoted, discriminatory dingbat,
[3:56:25.200 --> 3:56:27.200]  you can work for the New York Times.
[3:56:27.200 --> 3:56:29.200]  Is anyone surprised?
[3:56:29.200 --> 3:56:33.200]  And then these people wonder why real Americans hate the media.
[3:56:33.200 --> 3:56:35.200]  Why we think that CNN is fake news.
[3:56:35.200 --> 3:56:40.200]  Why the New York Times is despised because you're hiring racist.
[3:56:40.200 --> 3:56:42.200]  You are the new KKK.
[3:56:42.200 --> 3:56:46.200]  The NYT is the KKK of the online news world today.
[3:56:46.200 --> 3:56:48.200]  You're hiring racist bigots.
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:52.200]  You might as well have her wear a black pointy hood of some kind
[3:56:52.200 --> 3:56:53.200]  or a white pointy hood.
[3:56:53.200 --> 3:56:54.200]  It doesn't matter what the color is.
[3:56:54.200 --> 3:56:59.200]  Just put a pointy hood on that girl so the world can see what she really is.
[3:56:59.200 --> 3:57:00.200]  She's a racist.
[3:57:00.200 --> 3:57:02.200]  She hates white people.
[3:57:02.200 --> 3:57:04.200]  It's incredible.
[3:57:04.200 --> 3:57:07.200]  And this is the kind of thing that's going on every single day.
[3:57:07.200 --> 3:57:11.200]  Well, the answer, by the way, the solutions to wrap this up
[3:57:11.200 --> 3:57:14.200]  are to continue to support infowars.com.
