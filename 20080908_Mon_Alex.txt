[00:00.000 --> 00:07.500]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.500 --> 00:15.520]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:15.520 --> 00:34.680]  Welcome my friends. Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday edition of the
[00:34.680 --> 00:41.720]  Worldwide Transmission Against Tehranine. It is the 8th day of September 2008.
[00:41.720 --> 00:49.800]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours. We are only three days away from the
[00:49.800 --> 00:58.940]  7th anniversary of the false flag terror attacks launched by the continuity of government private
[00:58.940 --> 01:07.000]  corporate governorship of the United States and Europe. A criminal action meant to rekindle
[01:07.000 --> 01:14.120]  support for global empire and domestic police state enslavement grids on the home front in the
[01:14.120 --> 01:26.240]  regulated controlled homeland or human resource mining operations. I have a lot I want to talk
[01:26.240 --> 01:32.000]  about today in the next four hours. We have wide open phones. We do have some economic
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.040]  guests coming on later. Briefly some mini-guests to talk about what's happening with Fannie Mae and
[01:37.040 --> 01:44.320]  Freddie Mac. A lot of really important news today and we will be covering it all. Very important
[01:44.320 --> 01:52.160]  broadcast. Remember just six months ago the mainstream media said it was a conspiracy theory
[01:52.160 --> 02:02.240]  that only lunatics, most top economists and analysts, but not the ones that are putting on
[02:02.240 --> 02:09.440]  nightly television or in the financial pages, but most the real economists were saying Fannie
[02:09.440 --> 02:14.480]  Mae and Freddie Mac were going to be going under and that there wouldn't be a government takeover
[02:14.480 --> 02:19.720]  of them. And now what have you seen? And of course a year ago they told you the worst of the
[02:19.720 --> 02:28.120]  economic downturn had happened and that it was only rosy blue skies ahead. Now the government,
[02:28.120 --> 02:33.480]  the controlling corporate directorate knows fully well that it's going to get a lot worse because
[02:33.480 --> 02:37.640]  they are organizing the calamity, they are organizing the implosion, the collapse,
[02:39.320 --> 02:46.040]  the shearing, the mop-up operation, the strip mining, the bankruptcy of the dollar, the devaluation
[02:46.040 --> 02:52.920]  of the currency. Of course they know what's going to happen. They are running the entire
[02:52.920 --> 03:01.080]  operation openly stated in IMF and World Bank documents. Very simple. They took the dollars,
[03:01.080 --> 03:06.760]  the World Reserve currency. They issued unlimited amounts of liquidity to themselves, credit to
[03:06.760 --> 03:11.400]  themselves out of fiat backed up in our name. They bought the world's infrastructure including
[03:11.400 --> 03:16.440]  your city councils, governments, million dollar payoffs to mayors and police chiefs, special
[03:16.440 --> 03:22.520]  forces, CIA everywhere, every country in the world, huge buckets of hundred and thousand dollar bills,
[03:23.320 --> 03:31.080]  prostitutes, drugs, just a wave of mechanized focused corruption never before seen. They didn't
[03:31.080 --> 03:37.080]  just buy up the US, they bought up the world. And now they've got nuclear blackmail against any
[03:37.080 --> 03:42.680]  nation that doesn't fully submit. NATO publicly says they want nuclear war with Russia that their
[03:42.680 --> 03:48.440]  policy is a nuclear sneak attack on Russia. They released that over a year ago in the new NATO plan
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.800]  we've covered in detail there on air. I'm going to go back over the actual documents and the names
[03:53.800 --> 03:59.080]  and the and they said this is meant to provocate you Russia. We are going to new cube, prepare for
[03:59.080 --> 04:08.120]  war, just absolute psychopathic genius unleashed like nothing ever seen. Now they are geniuses,
[04:08.120 --> 04:14.440]  they are cunning, they are slick and they are going for broke. They are going for the stars
[04:14.440 --> 04:20.280]  when you talk about reaching for evil. They're going past the stars and nothing has ever been
[04:20.280 --> 04:27.240]  dreamed of like this, a giant Ponzi scheme scam where they take the world and we are given abject
[04:27.240 --> 04:33.320]  slavery where the police willingly inject themselves with mercury and cancer filled
[04:33.320 --> 04:38.280]  injections loving their masters where the military convulses and dies taking their
[04:38.280 --> 04:43.560]  injection still hailing the emperor a system where they take our children and we thank them for it
[04:44.200 --> 04:48.120]  a system where everything's imploding and we worship them stay with me
[04:48.120 --> 04:57.960]  may i have everybody's attention please i've come with a message of information

[06:11.000 --> 06:15.000]  those days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could
[06:15.000 --> 06:19.240]  grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in
[06:19.240 --> 06:23.080]  the cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how they didn't have the
[06:23.080 --> 06:27.240]  chickens in the livestock so it's a lot different for them well we know one thing's certain right

[08:07.400 --> 08:13.640]  monday through friday from 11 am until 2 p.m central standard time we're here live but
[08:13.640 --> 08:20.120]  we decided to add about five months ago an extra hour so now it's 11 to 3 p.m central standard
[08:20.120 --> 08:29.080]  time you say 11 a.m to 2 p.m for a decade and more than a decade and you get accustomed to
[08:29.720 --> 08:37.960]  saying that but now 11 to 3 central time back sundays 4 to 6 p.m pretty hardcore intro that i
[08:37.960 --> 08:47.240]  a little rant that i just went over in the first five minutes of transmission but it's true i mean
[08:47.240 --> 08:51.640]  one of their crimes that i've been mentioning a lot lately that we've known about for about five
[08:51.640 --> 08:57.880]  years was bear pharmaceutical not accidentally and then covering it up but knowingly for more than a
[08:57.880 --> 09:06.200]  decade shipping out over a million injections of the blood product factor eight knowing that every
[09:06.200 --> 09:11.560]  every dose was a guaranteed death sentence of hiv
[09:14.120 --> 09:20.440]  and of course hepatitis a b and c and other blood-borne diseases because there was such a
[09:20.440 --> 09:27.560]  concentrated massive dose of the hiv virus that it was taking a hundred percent of the time in
[09:27.560 --> 09:37.480]  those that took the blood drug and people read the mainstream news articles about this and they see
[09:37.480 --> 09:44.040]  the msnbc piece about it and then i even see our our own patreon websites debating if it's true no no
[09:44.040 --> 09:49.000]  bear admits they did it it came out in court hearings thanks to arrests that were made in
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.280]  france of the executives there nowhere else this was done worldwide there they did the right thing
[09:54.280 --> 10:01.320]  and in the documents it was brought to their attention 11 years before but it was only brought
[10:01.320 --> 10:06.840]  to their attention about our program of of of selling this in the u.s. has has been identified
[10:08.520 --> 10:13.160]  and our executives are just spinning it that oh it was some contaminated blood supply we'll do
[10:13.160 --> 10:16.920]  more screening not that we knew and shipped it out so what are we going to do with it and they
[10:16.920 --> 10:27.080]  said well ship the million plus dosages to europe and asia imagine just calmly ah every injection
[10:27.080 --> 10:35.880]  will kill them every i v pack that someone takes of this drug they will die ship it out
[10:37.640 --> 10:43.400]  and it's a minor news story they just calmly report it like it's no big deal
[10:43.400 --> 10:51.960]  and then even our own people when it's admitted in a several news wires and a couple tv shows
[10:51.960 --> 10:59.400]  did reports on it when the newscast admits they knowingly did it we still can't get our minds
[10:59.400 --> 11:11.640]  around that so we water it down ourselves kind of like dinecore and haliburton being caught
[11:11.640 --> 11:23.400]  going back to at least 1999 running giant huge scale i mean in one year and this is in the bbc
[11:28.120 --> 11:35.640]  this was in a whole bunch of major papers and publications we have whole archives on prison
[11:35.640 --> 11:48.360]  planet dot com going back to 2002 so we started that site 2002 2003 where it would report 1.2
[11:48.360 --> 11:54.120]  million women and children trafficked out of central and eastern europe in one year un's own
[11:54.120 --> 11:59.320]  report then the un doesn't tell you they're the ones running the operation certifying it they even
[11:59.320 --> 12:08.280]  tax it it's all official now the media will focus in then on the fact that of those
[12:08.280 --> 12:14.200]  million two in one year that the vast majority are close to a million of them if you read the
[12:14.200 --> 12:20.600]  actual reports the policy reports are women who got tricked into good jobs you know claiming they
[12:20.600 --> 12:26.920]  had good jobs are tricked to be models and they say well they're 18 years old they're 19 they're
[12:26.920 --> 12:35.480]  20 and yeah there's slaves now in israel and saudi arabia and georgia and syria
[12:36.040 --> 12:40.680]  and thailand and malaysia and singapore and the united states and england
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.760]  but you know they asked for it it's kind of like other women let them be slaves
[12:47.720 --> 12:53.720]  what if you read deeper that one year 300 000 of them were children
[12:53.720 --> 13:00.680]  and then national italian television and german tv did reports and the italian tv crew got
[13:00.680 --> 13:04.360]  fired for airing it because it turned out italian officials were involved
[13:06.600 --> 13:13.960]  in hundreds of snuff films where three-year-old boys and girls are raped and then their heads
[13:13.960 --> 13:23.480]  are blown off with firearms and it's a huge market and you find out who's running this
[13:23.480 --> 13:28.760]  private contractors elements of the cia who do you think runs black sites ghost sites what do you
[13:28.760 --> 13:34.280]  think they introduced torture and said torture is good and torture of children's good in front
[13:34.280 --> 13:40.200]  of their parents and rape is good because they want to sell other people in the cia and other
[13:40.200 --> 13:45.640]  agencies and private contractors that it's okay because even a psychopathic killer they profile
[13:45.640 --> 13:53.800]  and hire or an aggravated felon they hire or a former federal jail guard who's been removed
[13:53.800 --> 13:58.120]  for raping and torturing people and they hire them that's who they've hired they still go i'm
[13:58.120 --> 14:03.240]  not going to rape that little kid even though i quote want to that's what these individuals are
[14:03.240 --> 14:08.520]  out there saying i've got to be given orders and writing and they go here it is do it directive
[14:08.520 --> 14:16.360]  from the president and they go absolutely ladies and gentlemen this is what they are doing
[14:18.440 --> 14:21.560]  this is who you're dealing with and they are recruiting a larger
[14:21.560 --> 14:26.360]  and larger cadres of people that love to torture people that love to rape children
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.680]  people that love to do the most depraved things on earth and this is all admitted you see
[14:32.680 --> 14:40.120]  the clinton's reportedly got billions in their swiss bank accounts from the communist chinese
[14:40.120 --> 14:48.520]  and others for selling the nation out and from laurel and hughes and others for letting them
[14:48.520 --> 14:56.440]  sell the country out for just the long march three stage system and the merve couplers and the
[14:56.440 --> 15:08.680]  directing reentry chips billions but it wasn't enough they stole a a bunch of the china out of
[15:08.680 --> 15:15.320]  the white house and they did that because they are at their very base element thieves
[15:16.120 --> 15:20.520]  they're crooks a crook is always a crook is a crook that's why they're always catching
[15:20.520 --> 15:25.960]  the FBI agents and CIA people and well-known globalist shoplifting and things then it gets
[15:25.960 --> 15:33.160]  quieted gets shut down how many hundreds of homeland security deputy directors and local
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.200]  directors have been caught trying to rape children caught picking up children caught involved
[15:38.200 --> 15:45.480]  because that's it's a guild of these people it's a guild of sadist tortures thieves child rapist
[15:46.440 --> 15:49.640]  and in every state you see that's who's running things and they get caught all the time
[15:49.640 --> 15:54.680]  because the entire system isn't corrupt yet good parts of the system bust them bring them down
[15:54.680 --> 15:59.400]  now the texas rangers found out that at every major texas youth commission facility they were
[15:59.400 --> 16:05.640]  having public rape parties the judges and cops were coming in and paying to rape the children
[16:05.640 --> 16:10.840]  local officials were you know you know most your psychopaths that they never catch your cops
[16:11.560 --> 16:14.920]  occasionally they get drunk and are caught with a dead body and then it you know comes out and
[16:14.920 --> 16:21.320]  kind of shut down the news i mean these are guilds of psychos and killers and rapists and the texas
[16:21.320 --> 16:29.160]  rangers which i have to say are not a corrupt organization that's why they fired the head of
[16:29.160 --> 16:33.400]  the dps it's why they're trying to take them over right now the head of the dps was fired over
[16:33.400 --> 16:40.520]  letting the texas rangers investigate all this just so you know wasn't over that little stage
[16:40.520 --> 16:46.120]  thing that inside job they did setting the building on fire while it had two security fences up on it
[16:47.320 --> 16:52.200]  and when the governor ordered security to stand down it's always the same with these people
[16:52.200 --> 16:58.760]  and they found out that they were even having gladiatorial fight nights people were paying to
[16:58.760 --> 17:06.440]  come see with the teenagers see i don't have to go outside my state out in bass drop the women's prison
[17:06.440 --> 17:13.800]  run by one of the big private security companies where they were videotaping raping the women
[17:13.800 --> 17:18.280]  all of the women it was reported in the statesman one time in the local paper and that president
[17:18.280 --> 17:25.720]  lost its contract evil takes over folks because they want to be able to get away with what they're
[17:25.720 --> 17:35.000]  doing and that's why you see petty crime like stealing the white house china being engaged in
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.520]  remember madeline albright it was a 60 minute special shot in her georgetown home
[17:39.720 --> 17:44.040]  and there was all this stolen art from when her dad was the head commissar
[17:44.040 --> 17:46.440]  in tecloslovakia and killed over a million people
[17:49.720 --> 17:55.640]  then they fled to syria would she repay them with a bombing campaign again they revel in
[17:55.640 --> 18:06.680]  being betrayers but there was five and ten and twenty million dollar stolen remnants on her wall
[18:06.680 --> 18:16.040]  and other i'm just all every painting worth millions loot stolen loot these people are killers
[18:16.040 --> 18:24.760]  they're hardcore they respect each other on who have killed the most people that's why when
[18:24.760 --> 18:29.640]  the big brzezinski walks on stage he engineered the polpot massacres the first two million they
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.560]  kneel to him that's why david rockefeller is so respected they are respected just like local mob
[18:37.560 --> 18:44.120]  boys will brag oh that's jimmy two faces he's got six bones under his belt oh man he's killed six
[18:44.120 --> 18:51.480]  people big deal these guys run giant child kidnapping snuff ring operations these people

[19:16.120 --> 19:23.320]  to how insane it is how crazy it is people say well they're so evil and powerful why are you
[19:23.320 --> 19:28.360]  still alive i know listeners you could sick of me explaining this but i could ask this in hundreds
[19:28.360 --> 19:35.160]  of emails a day now because if they kill me it will draw attention to what they're doing because
[19:35.160 --> 19:42.200]  no one gets it like me like myself on what they're doing their program because we're accurate they
[19:42.200 --> 19:47.560]  want to ignore me and minimize me and discredit me and i got to be honest with you these people are so
[19:47.560 --> 19:55.000]  sick a lot of them like hearing about their exploits okay a day unlike any other in the
[19:55.000 --> 20:01.320]  long course of american history a terrorist act of war against this country the enemy struck america on

[20:12.360 --> 20:17.080]  look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the united states some u.s

[36:26.360 --> 36:33.240]  keep myself i would find away you know a friend of mine named darrell told me a story and i heard
[36:33.240 --> 36:38.760]  it years before it's a little parable and i told it a few weeks ago but not in its entirety
[36:38.760 --> 36:47.400]  the eyes are the window to the soul they are think of it as your soul is a tower and within
[36:47.400 --> 36:58.760]  that tower and the uppermost reaches is your spark of existence of awareness
[36:59.560 --> 37:06.840]  and in that tower there are two windows and those are your eyes so you can look out onto the
[37:06.840 --> 37:15.720]  world around you that island of consciousness and if someone came to you and said this is
[37:15.720 --> 37:20.440]  this is great to say to somebody that says yeah but the new order can offer you power money
[37:22.360 --> 37:33.400]  control sex privilege security but to sell out to the new world order you will have to
[37:35.000 --> 37:43.560]  sell out your humanity you'll have to sell out not just your eyesight but the soul itself that's
[37:43.560 --> 37:53.640]  looking out what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul you should
[37:53.640 --> 37:57.400]  ask yourself that every morning when you wake up at every evening when you go to sleep that's what
[37:57.400 --> 38:04.040]  i do what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose their soul if someone came to
[38:04.040 --> 38:07.400]  you and said i'll give you ten thousand dollars to go to a clinic and have your eyes removed and
[38:07.400 --> 38:16.920]  sell them to me you would say no twenty thousand you'd say no thirty thousand you'd say no a million
[38:16.920 --> 38:26.280]  dollars everyone would say no unless they were mentally ill or stupid mentally retarded you
[38:26.280 --> 38:30.760]  could offer somebody a ten million a hundred million you ask a blind person what they would give
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.040]  for sight especially a blind person who's never had sight never experienced it and they say i would
[38:36.040 --> 38:43.480]  give everything in the world for sight i would give anything in the world for sight in fact it's
[38:43.480 --> 38:51.000]  kind of an enigma wrapped in a riddle because one of the few groups of people that you could
[38:51.000 --> 38:57.240]  actually see them selling their soul would be a blind person for sight but then they wouldn't have
[38:57.240 --> 39:10.360]  what connects through those eyes to see and the world comes to you and says sell out your moral
[39:10.360 --> 39:20.840]  sell out your your name sell out who you are sell out your beliefs and you'll be given power
[39:20.840 --> 39:27.720]  or you'll be given all the signals and symbols and logos and all the trinkets and bobbles that come
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.400]  with it and those individuals are completely unhappy i mean if you're just a worldly person
[39:33.400 --> 39:39.560]  who's just into basic worldliness very unhappy then you have those on the true dark side who are
[39:40.120 --> 39:46.280]  driven by evil and who are basically like wraiths that's why we have these old parables of the
[39:46.280 --> 39:51.480]  wraiths they are only alive and described murdering and killing and torturing and overthrowing and
[39:51.480 --> 39:57.400]  hurting and the screams of a child begging for its life as like a shining white like like like
[39:57.400 --> 40:04.680]  electricity they're only alive and can only think and can only be when they're committing acts of
[40:04.680 --> 40:14.600]  evil they have sold their soul they are blind and evil only gives them brief sight when they are
[40:14.600 --> 40:23.160]  committing horrific acts and then it's described as a blinding white exhilarating hallucination
[40:26.520 --> 40:31.800]  we're discussing the nature of evil ladies and gentlemen because to understand evil
[40:31.800 --> 40:37.480]  is to understand the enemy that we face they are literally ghouls
[40:37.480 --> 40:44.760]  they have turned over everything it is to be human and everything it is to be connected
[40:44.760 --> 40:50.680]  to the creator's source they have been cut off from creativity they will never know
[40:51.400 --> 40:59.080]  the deep living waters of love and compassion and goodness and creativity and being honorable
[41:00.520 --> 41:05.000]  of brotherhood of motherhood of fatherhood of sisterhood
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  they will never know
[41:11.880 --> 41:15.320]  they are committed to the bottomless gulf
[41:18.360 --> 41:24.680]  the dark fire that draws them like moths to the flame of the sun
[41:24.680 --> 41:34.680]  the weak sense power in darkness title destructive tectonic
[41:43.400 --> 41:43.720]  death
[41:43.720 --> 41:58.680]  but death is nothing compared to the magic of life
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.480]  all right i could talk all day about the nature of evil and what we face
[42:09.480 --> 42:18.920]  but it is empowering and i'm still worldly and i still sin i still do bad things
[42:19.800 --> 42:25.080]  and i have to fight every day to make the proper moral decisions and to not be a bad person
[42:25.080 --> 42:30.120]  because i have seen over the rainbow as they say i have seen the full spectrum
[42:31.880 --> 42:37.240]  does that mean i've seen to the ends of every color of the rainbow no but i have seen deeply
[42:37.240 --> 42:44.280]  into it i have experienced more than most will ever even imagine in this waking life
[42:47.720 --> 42:52.360]  and to have looked into that to have stared into that
[42:54.280 --> 42:59.080]  but what it needs he said once does not stare into the abyss so it stares back and
[42:59.080 --> 43:00.760]  be careful you do not become the abyss
[43:00.760 --> 43:09.240]  to know evil one has to in their mind experience the mind of the enemy
[43:10.760 --> 43:20.040]  and i have seen that blinding black destructive light it has shown right through me right through

[49:49.480 --> 49:54.520]  not the ultimate crime it's one thing to torture and kill a child it's another thing to try to
[49:54.520 --> 50:01.720]  destroy the species itself to try to butcher the very dna to try to deform it and crush it and
[50:02.440 --> 50:12.200]  blast it and twist it you are something else and I do marvel at your system I do marvel at the

[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:37.160]  in a primitive way kind of like a male bird will have a bunch of big shiny
[1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:42.280]  green and red feathers to impress the female and that's all it is and when the old times the
[1:01:42.280 --> 1:01:49.000]  police war headdresses you then think they're omnipresent and god they're not in fact if they've

[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:32.360]  hitting me going at it very fun to get out there and then it was even better to have them laughing
[1:08:33.080 --> 1:08:39.720]  and making fun of us and having evil celebrations several msnbc employees saying hi we broke her
[1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:46.520]  bullhorn as i left and i didn't stop i didn't engage him i went and was going towards the nearest
[1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:51.560]  radio shack to buy another bullhorn it was about eight minutes out when luke uh we called luke
[1:08:51.560 --> 1:09:03.560]  and they were in route with the bullhorns just luck of the gods as they say and uh boom we got
[1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:11.560]  their law who's like six seven huge you know like pro football player you know model guy
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:20.120]  by luke climbs up on his shoulders i've got a wireless a giant megaphone so i've got a headset
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:24.840]  on doing it blasting them for two more hours and we were about ready to go and then oberman
[1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:31.080]  basically begged us to stop we said okay to make the point that he reported on false flag
[1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:35.880]  terrorism when chaney planned to have navy seals attack our own ships was overruled a few months
[1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:42.120]  ago that's mainstream news folks since he covered that and nobody else did on tv though it was in
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:49.960]  print we stopped bullhorning him and then all the monday morning quarterback said you should
[1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:56.360]  continue yeah hey you know what you guys can chant better stuff into a bullhorn let me give you a
[1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:04.600]  little newsflash get out of mama's basement put down the hot pockets or the pop tarts put down
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:11.480]  the marijuana bowl and uh get out get some sunshine and then go out and let msnbc security attack you
[1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:18.680]  and yes ladies and gentlemen then others say well why didn't you just slug them back
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:25.960]  why didn't richard reeves when they ran up to him and bashed into him and broke the camera
[1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:32.440]  because then the mission would have been compromised the bullhorning the police would
[1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:38.120]  have come in and arrested everybody involved and then we wouldn't have been able to continue
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:44.920]  to take over national television so as they're punching me as they're hitting me in the ribs as
[1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:51.320]  three of them at one time grabbing the bullhorn away from me and as some nilly person was hitting
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:56.680]  me in the head with some long plastic thing literally i looked over this person was going
[1:10:56.680 --> 1:11:02.040]  uh uh uh making this weird feminine something feminine you want a man drives back like a woman

[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:19.080]  bullhorning 9-11's an inside job and there's all these cave dwellers who are going oh you didn't
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:26.920]  do it probably you didn't hey you get your butt out on the field and let's see what you do the
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:32.360]  truth is it's dynamic video it's one for the record books and it shows you how it's done the whole
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:40.520]  team and how within 15 minutes of them assaulting myself rob erin i mean they were punching us folks
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:47.560]  people go oh i saw one of them video punch you you're a wimp no i could have easily with pleasure
[1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:54.600]  but i had to not even let it tempt me just just just smashed teeth out but then the cops will
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:12:01.080]  arrest whoever hurts somebody the worst so these little weak cowards could elbow me and hit me in
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:06.360]  the ribs and i got a few bruises from it but it felt good while they were doing it it actually hurt
[1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:12.440]  not into like it physically but my spirit was strong as these lesser men the scum the servants
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:20.760]  of evil these first women attacking fools were attacking me it was good it's what life was all
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:31.240]  about standing firm in the middle of the storm with god's hand on me and this was nothing i'm not
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:35.400]  saying it's some great exploit but it's a great exploit compared to all the couch potatoes all
[1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:42.840]  the know-it-alls individuals that never did anything in their lives and but what they don't
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:46.760]  matter what matters is the young people the old people the middle-aged folks black white
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:53.880]  ispanic asian old young that will see videos like this that's up on info wars dot com right now ms mbc
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:13:00.360]  security assaults alex jones and equipment with deadly weapon they will see that video and that
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:06.920]  will inspire them and that's what scares the enemy and the gang of paid provocateurs and their camp
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:15.400]  followers that we allow to post on info wars dot com all their defaming lying information because
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:21.640]  they're only educating the posters about the new world order's operations their people are catching
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:25.800]  the same person under other names posting the same cut and paste they're seeing it on youtube
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:34.120]  they're seeing the people are checking their handles finding out their scent com finding out
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:38.200]  their previous quotes where they've been sloppy and it's really a big awakening for people to go
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:45.720]  my god the us military is engaging info wars dot com and you don't think they don't go in and get
[1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:49.160]  codes and bring down sites you don't think they don't hack them and bring them down you don't
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:52.920]  think they haven't done stuff you've never even heard us talk about on this show where there's no
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:14:02.360]  doubt where they let you know when they take your site down by having a little message there for you
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:05.560]  that's when you know it's real ladies and gentlemen
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:12.520]  that's when you know the new world order is real when four guys in a parking lot are pounding on
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:16.680]  you saying keep your mouth shut about the new world order or next time you're dead that's when
[1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:21.480]  you know it's real that's when it really comes home that's when there's no doubt that's when
[1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:29.800]  you're sure of it all and nothing feels better than being on the right side of things nothing
[1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:36.840]  feels better than being with the good because evil is weak and evil is bad and evil stinks
[1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:47.480]  feels good to be wearing a white hat it is good it's good for me it's good for you
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:51.800]  it's good for all of us and it's good to be part of this brotherhood
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:57.480]  the sisterhood it's good to be part of real humanity awake humanity those of us that were
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:15:01.080]  immune to the propaganda or woke up to the propaganda or had family and friends that
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:07.880]  loved us enough to wake us up feels good to be part of this brotherhood and yes i may die
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:12.040]  i'll certainly die one day but i may die sooner rather than later they may come after me but that
[1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:16.680]  doesn't matter because we're all part of a brotherhood and we live on through this brotherhood
[1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:21.720]  of man through this brotherhood of honor and decency and creativity and goodness and those
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:25.800]  that understand that we're part of the species and we're passing something forward to our children
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:29.560]  and they're great great grandchildren don't you know if you could meet your great great great
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:34.440]  great grandson and see him as a baby or your great great great granddaughter you would love them as
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:40.520]  much as you loved your firstborn and we're all related to each other so i love everybody i even
[1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:48.680]  love those that hate me now but it doesn't mean i don't defeat them it doesn't mean just like when
[1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:58.440]  i had a red on yellow killer fella red on yellow kills the fella in my backyard coral snake cobra
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:06.280]  family the third most poisonous snake in the world it's a beautiful snake three feet long as big as
[1:16:06.280 --> 1:16:14.680]  they get it was right out by my children's jungle gym and it was nesting in my yard and if the government
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:18.280]  wasn't corrupt and evil and wouldn't try to set me up you can't trust the government the mental
[1:16:18.280 --> 1:16:21.560]  patients that work for it i would have called the government to come get the snake and take it
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:27.240]  somewhere but i did a cost benefit analysis went in and double checked on the internet that that was
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:36.040]  the red on yellow killer fella coral snake so i took a hoe and i killed it and i didn't enjoy it
[1:16:39.320 --> 1:16:44.520]  i get sad when you have little pink geckos everywhere in austin and you you'll close a door
[1:16:44.520 --> 1:16:49.720]  on one it happens every few weeks you'll find one dead in your kitchen it's real sad their little
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:56.600]  mummified body and see the evil would see me as weak because because i love that little creature
[1:16:56.600 --> 1:17:02.040]  but it has a life it has ideas it has a mate maybe it hasn't mated yet it it needs to have its
[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:08.840]  experience it's got its line and all the adversity everything that its ancestors went through and
[1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:17.480]  it's this incredible beautiful little see-through creature it has a function eating bugs and living
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:27.240]  out by the lamp of my front porch and to see it cut in half by the door frame to see its blood
[1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:32.920]  they're smudged it's enough to make me cry and it's not because i'm weak it's because i'm strong
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:38.360]  you see a lot of people become evil because they go through pain in their lives
[1:17:39.800 --> 1:17:42.200]  and they learn how to harden their heart and it makes it feel better
[1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:49.240]  and then when people abuse them they learn how to abuse back and it gives them a flicker that dark
[1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:55.400]  light and that fire grows and consumes them and that's why you got to know when to hold
[1:17:55.400 --> 1:17:59.320]  them know when to fold them know when to walk away know when to run pull that Kenny Rogers song
[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:06.200]  up it's not no regular system but it's in the computer and so people can say you know it's
[1:18:06.200 --> 1:18:10.200]  the duality of men they can say you say turn the other cheek but we've seen you punch somebody
[1:18:10.200 --> 1:18:15.160]  we've seen you push somebody back when they push you that's right i'm not perfect because i say
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:21.080]  i have this loftier higher level and there is a time to shoot back there is a time to defend your
[1:18:21.080 --> 1:18:28.440]  family there is a time to stand up but you've got to have wisdom cunning and knowledge is not wisdom
[1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:33.880]  wisdom is understanding how it affects the greater whole and understanding how you're
[1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:38.920]  interconnected to everything in the universe and wisdom is extrapolating down the line and seeing
[1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:48.200]  how things interconnect and i and my wisdom is intensifying exponentially it is and i don't
[1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:55.400]  even claim to be advanced in my wisdom but it is advancing in my understanding and my predictive
[1:18:55.400 --> 1:19:03.240]  powers not psychic power but predictive mathematical innate ability is accelerating so fast and then
[1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:10.360]  i realize that our enemies have that same incredible human mind in many cases greater
[1:19:10.360 --> 1:19:13.960]  and they have all the best minds working for them most of the best minds who many of which
[1:19:13.960 --> 1:19:18.440]  are compartmentalized and are specialized and so don't see the bigger picture they're part of
[1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:26.040]  and are committing great evil that's the enemy's greatest tool is that they have a lot of good people
[1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:35.160]  but who are not sophisticated enough or not generalist enough not versatile enough don't
[1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:42.920]  have enough street smarts or who rationalize because they're comfortable the routine you have
[1:19:42.920 --> 1:19:47.160]  to awaken from that and get outside the box and then get outside the box and get outside the box
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:57.880]  again and then again it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a
[1:19:57.880 --> 1:20:04.600]  powerful world government it's known as the builder bird put their objective the world domination
[1:20:05.160 --> 1:20:11.240]  for thousands of years their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:20.440]  their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand for the first time in history
[1:20:20.440 --> 1:20:25.960]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open you will learn the secret that drives the
[1:20:25.960 --> 1:20:30.840]  entire new world order agenda builder is making great progress toward a world government most
[1:20:30.840 --> 1:20:34.760]  people have no idea they're not after money they have all the money they need they're after power

[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:30.280]  all right let me uh
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:34.760]  get into fanny freddy mac
[1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:43.000]  first they told us it wasn't going to fold wasn't going to be nationalized
[1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:51.720]  publicly they're saying 50 plus trillion dollars but the big news here isn't that
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:57.320]  there was collusion or corruption this is how the mystery of evil works
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:04.760]  where the brokers and the assessors uh and the uh real estate agents
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:14.440]  the citizens the banks the brokerage houses all of them colluded together
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:18.600]  and the media and the government advertised this is the new way you just keep leveraging
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:23.240]  your house up and up and up and it did come out again an imf and world bank documents
[1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:26.680]  that they'd done this in argentina and other places they were planning to do that in europe in the
[1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:33.000]  us i mean that this is a plan banks issue and create all this liquidity and currency
[1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:39.320]  that is the privately controlled treasuries that are quasi government issued that to them
[1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:44.680]  and then out of the currency and liquidity created the banks get debt but they want to
[1:25:44.680 --> 1:25:48.440]  have economies implode so they can consolidate and get real assets
[1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:58.520]  and so when you take freddy and fanny freddy mac and fanny may
[1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:03.880]  when you take these groups with 50
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:13.240]  plus trillion there's different numbers 53 56 57 depending on how it's broken down by the
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:18.120]  treasury you take this that was always quote government back when they set this up decades ago
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:25.560]  always planning to screw you and now they're down to the end of the line with the ponzi scheme
[1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:32.360]  and i'm not the only one saying this i mean there are newspaper articles and reports
[1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:35.160]  where they're admitting this is all a giant scam and the biggest crime of the century
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:39.080]  i was watching the press conference last night with paul sin and others and i mean they're just
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:44.600]  up there looking guilty as sin just total hardcore crooks you're looking at trillions
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:52.600]  being stolen you say why because when they sold those securities they would then count them as
[1:26:52.600 --> 1:27:00.120]  assets and leverage them 10 times under us fractional reserve banking there's a 10 to 1
[1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:04.360]  leverage in england some parts of europe only have an 8 to 1 some parts of the world in asia
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:11.480]  have 20 to 1 and then they take that 20 to 1 10 to 1 8 to 1 ratio of 50 plus trillion
[1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:19.480]  and then they leverage it out so what's 10 times 57 trillion and then leverage that out 10 times
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:23.880]  and then leverage that out 10 times and then leverage that out 10 times and then leverage that
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:32.520]  out 10 times it is conservatively in the thousands of trillions and by the month it grows by the
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:39.880]  thousands of trillions more money more assets than that fictional money represents already
[1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:46.840]  thousands of times all the assets in the world and guess who they're setting the precedent right
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:51.560]  now claiming oh the american people were greedy and lied on their mortgages that's what's causing
[1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:56.520]  all this no it's credit cards it's other investments it's the city and county and state investments
[1:27:56.520 --> 1:28:01.800]  under the secret comprehensive annual financial report funds which are now public
[1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:08.200]  and then there's this good old-fashioned stealing like four plus trillion
[1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:14.440]  in the last nine years stolen out of the pentagon trust funds it's all gone
[1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:21.160]  trillion stolen everywhere else just mass stealing armored fortresses in the bahamas
[1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:26.440]  and in the Mediterranean and just just just thousands of globalists living with huge private
[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:33.480]  security that helicopter pads underground bases continuity of government unlimited because while
[1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:38.440]  all this fiat currency was worth something they bought up the entire planet that's why they're
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:43.880]  announcing oh basically new york city's owned by some private banks now oh austin texas is
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:48.040]  basically owned by private banks and all that land that the city stole the last 20 years from
[1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:52.840]  farmers and ranchers that's being given to private banks now and oh your police force is going to
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:29:00.360]  be private now and oh you're gonna have to have national service and work 10 15 20 hours a week
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:07.880]  for the government to pay off the national debt and oh the the cia is going to triple in size and
[1:29:07.880 --> 1:29:11.880]  is running pr ads about how they're going to be operating inside the us now they've always been
[1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:19.160]  doing it but now openly committing crime so so the criminals are robbing the bank robbing the
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:23.560]  country and then that's what the police states for to make sure while you lose everything you've
[1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:30.280]  gotten it goes to them and is given to cops and military and people that you don't like it so get

[1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:56.680]  he turned back toward the window crushed out his cigarette faded off to sleep
[1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:05.640]  then somewhere in the darkness the gambler he broke even but in his final words i found

[1:35:53.640 --> 1:36:00.600]  lots of uh lofty vocabulary which i could have done but then none of it would have been intelligible
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:07.160]  with chris mathews and his guest and other guests talking over us
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:15.960]  but instead by saying 9 11's an inside job 10 times in a row investigate 9 11 10 times in a row
[1:36:16.520 --> 1:36:24.120]  google inside job 10 times in a row info wars dot com 10 times in a row we are changed 10 times in a
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:31.240]  row i'm not grandstanding here folks people arguing about this has become quite an argument
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:35.960]  i want you have you ever go out and do this to listen to my advice unless you've got something
[1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:42.760]  better and i've done this quite a few times now i mean have you done it you've been arrested for
[1:36:42.760 --> 1:36:55.560]  doing it i have i mean that's a question i'm asking millions of people watching 9 11 truth
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:59.880]  taken over fox msnbc you name and it's happening everywhere other people are doing it but you
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:04.840]  know what 9 11 truth's doing and we are changed other folks are doing luke listen to me but other
[1:37:04.840 --> 1:37:08.120]  groups are going and bullhorning and giving speeches and all you hear in the background is
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:15.880]  blah blah blah because you can't hear something said once and in a speech it's only said once so
[1:37:15.880 --> 1:37:23.080]  people can't ever make out what you're saying my point is there's a method to our madness here
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:26.840]  for people that just uh you know come around and give us all this advice
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:33.960]  i'm trying to give you some advice from somebody who's walked a mile in those shoes you haven't
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:38.840]  that's all i'm asking you to do nothing more
[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:49.080]  but we are a nation of critics it's easy to sit up in the high seats in the nosebleed section
[1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:53.400]  and talk about what somebody should or shouldn't have done to second guess all day
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:02.200]  down on the field but it's another thing to be on the field and i'd welcome you to the field
[1:38:02.200 --> 1:38:05.480]  i bet there are a lot of you smarter or well spoken more effective than i
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:08.360]  believe me i don't have some high view of myself
[1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:13.560]  it's up to you
[1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:20.600]  and people say well why are you taking over live tv programs they go out to public sites they
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:25.080]  advertise that they're hearing from the public they do it right off the side of a city street
[1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:31.320]  you know our founding fathers tarred and feathered people our founding fathers lynched people
[1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:36.280]  our founding fathers set fire to buildings i'm not saying do any of that but we're so timid
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:42.280]  that going and shouting down mainstream media
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:49.720]  that that's wrong that we shouldn't be doing that
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:57.320]  and you call yourselves patriots well we all know you're not
[1:38:57.320 --> 1:39:04.680]  what your status your establishment government workers your paid for bloggers your i mean
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:10.280]  michel malkin openly both their sites the main sponsors homeland security and it's really
[1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:17.960]  homeland security i've got all these clips today of all these cia radio and tv ads that are
[1:39:17.960 --> 1:39:21.080]  airing we're posting someone info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:29.640]  and the last week it's on every major radio station in austin including k lbj that i broadcast
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:35.800]  out of on sunday's

[1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:51.240]  action join the cia and they've got cia ads on children's television we've got some of those
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:57.400]  and nsa ads on children's television the nsa said it didn't exist 15 years ago
[1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:04.360]  they would arrest or intimidate reporters that would even go videotape the building
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:07.640]  they called me a conspiracy theorist in major newspapers in the late 90s
[1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:14.680]  and now they're running cartoon ads for the nsa and the cia they're doing that for pr because
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:19.880]  now they're going to be a daily part of our lives they're getting you ready for them to use nsa
[1:40:19.880 --> 1:40:26.120]  intercepts in regular crime and on citizens and prompt up fake audio and video they're getting
[1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:31.960]  you ready with the local threat emergency centers in every city that are cia run to have them openly
[1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:37.480]  liaisoning with the public shadow government you see people always say well they're in a new world order
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:43.320]  well yes there is a new world order but it was growing it was embryonic it was running side by side
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:51.320]  with the republic but now it's covertly like i talked about yesterday on on the sunday show
[1:40:52.200 --> 1:40:56.040]  i mean i've interviewed a governor i've interviewed two police chiefs i've interviewed a marine
[1:40:56.040 --> 1:41:04.680]  corps captain who were involved in the 80s and 90s in covert operations where they would just come
[1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:09.560]  to a governor and say we are your boss do as we say or will basically destroy you and we won't
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:16.040]  tell you who we are we're just cia 23 of them in the office jessie ventura or chief of police
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:20.520]  san antonio delta force comes to him and others with hundreds of thousands in cash and said
[1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:25.640]  we just want to give you this cash to work with us well what's the work well first we want you to
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:33.640]  just take the cash no strings attached that's co-optic just like they do in guatemala city
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:39.240]  guatemala city panamal city
[1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:48.520]  russia iran that's what special ops do there that's what cia does there
[1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:53.640]  they go around and say hey we want you to work with us government here's a million
[1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:59.480]  dollars but it's not the u.s. government it's a criminal corporate takeover totally lawless
[1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:07.000]  at last time i checked it was over 40 billion dollars in pallets of hundred and thousand
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:12.680]  dollar bills flown in that we know of and they and they're now training us to evil and then they
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:20.040]  give every private 25 35 grand then they tell them hey this was illegal boys you got to kill
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:25.160]  that army or marine corps inspector of us looking into stolen equipment they only gave you schmucks
[1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:29.880]  that 30 grand so that when they're stealing helicopters and weapons or planting wmd's
[1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:38.440]  or killing investigators you are compromised dummies and then they see who likes the money
[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:46.760]  they see who's a criminal and the colonel that isn't the colonel that's there who's gung ho he gets
[1:42:46.760 --> 1:42:51.000]  fragged or maybe you're a pat tilman who's already had millions didn't want to be part of the payoffs
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:43:00.440]  that want to be part of guarding opium fields got a bunch of jealous people on the unit they
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:05.400]  assigned some cia to it and they gun him down and he starts yelling pat tilman pat tilman
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:08.440]  and they go right up on him and gun him down right there on the spot
[1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:16.680]  so you want to join the cia do you want to join special forces do you you want to torture people
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:23.160]  you want to be used you want to be compartmentalized you want to be laughed at they'll say you're a

[1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:02.920]  that up on the side that you can go wash it for yourself is a bunch of masons they got their
[1:46:02.920 --> 1:46:09.640]  hats and everything and oh sweet lucifer oh gosh sweet lucifer the thing is you don't find that
[1:46:09.640 --> 1:46:15.640]  out to you've been a mason for about 20 years on average then they tell you it's time to love oh you
[1:46:15.640 --> 1:46:27.160]  heard him oh sweet lucifer oh lucifer oh my goodness and that's who runs the show sweet oh sweet
[1:46:27.160 --> 1:46:32.840]  lucifer oh sweet virtuous oh i can feel it right now seething in me oh that's what they say
[1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:41.960]  oh i feel the power to lucifer seething seething god help us folks god helps they believe lucifer
[1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:55.560]  and jesus are brothers oh sweet lucifer so sick man so sick but again they fool a lot of people
[1:46:55.560 --> 1:47:01.960]  the founding fathers bad no and it was more of a bible based at almost every level and more of a
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:07.720]  construction guild secret knowledge guild private university guild fraternity of men guild until
[1:47:07.720 --> 1:47:17.640]  1776 and then it really went back to its roots but see a lot of people haven't read uh the book of
[1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:26.520]  solemn because it's all in the old testament it's all right there instead of what the masons say
[1:47:26.520 --> 1:47:35.400]  about solemn go read that book and then you'll know hard i said i'd take calls but i've been on
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:39.240]  somewhat of a roll today ranting uh we'll just go to him right now and then i'm gonna get back
[1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:43.240]  into what's happening with the economy and where this is gonna go this is uh not good ladies and
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:50.840]  gentlemen to say the least and the fact that they did take over fanny man freddy mac does not bode
[1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:57.240]  well for anybody unless you're the globalist and now the government owns most of the mortgages in
[1:47:57.240 --> 1:48:02.920]  this country a large portion of them and uh we told you that would happen our experts told you
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:09.720]  six seven months ago that would happen and if things continue this this is going to be a
[1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:15.720]  hardcore depression and uh you're gonna have to pay that back you need you need to understand that
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:19.800]  you're gonna have to pay back not just that mortgage but all the trillions that have been
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:24.840]  leveraged because they take each mortgage and then count that debt like a promissory note
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:33.320]  as a asset and then they sell it and then they leverage that 10 times and 10 times and 10 times
[1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:39.480]  into infinity hundreds of billions turned into thousands of trillions turned into infinity
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:45.240]  and they just create the fiat and then most the cops will kill for it the teachers will brainwash
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:49.720]  for it the bureaucrats will say yes yes yes for it but they're all compartmentalized with their own
[1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:53.480]  you know division or or office propaganda of why they're doing what they're doing what they're
[1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:59.000]  not really all compartmentalized that's why the symbol of the new world order is the pyramid
[1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:03.480]  okay
[1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:12.520]  paul you are here early today i like it maybe we'll do two hours of live video feeds okay i'm

[1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:28.360]  not all over bad have you ever heard of a sheriff mac before yeah i've had sheriff mack on probably
[1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:33.480]  15 times yeah i mean there are people like that out there including those in the court systems
[1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:36.280]  that actually would take the criminal complaint if you can find them
[1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:43.320]  but all you would need to do is get a copy of the secretary of state certification
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:48.600]  and you would basically go get the documents the bar campaign requested and you've therefore
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:53.560]  proved that they've committed a crime out in the open are are you saying i should do this
[1:55:53.560 --> 1:55:58.520]  i'm saying anybody in the united states can do it i mean once i get the documents i'd be willing
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:56:04.200]  to go just do it myself good that's a good idea you need to do that and then uh have a press conference
[1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:09.480]  when you do it yeah because uh i know the more people that do it the more likely it is to go but
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:14.760]  you know i'm trying to see what i can do to help other people get involved with me all right bro we

[1:56:52.840 --> 1:56:56.280]  to continue to let them know that but it's even better to go bullhorn their house like we've been

[2:01:25.880 --> 2:01:34.120]  has had the opportunity to stand personally one-on-one face-to-face with both the canadian head of
[2:01:34.120 --> 2:01:41.800]  homeland security in the harper cabinet his name is stockwell day and i also was able to talk personally

[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:52.600]  election here in canada and i gave them both the information that 911 is an inside job
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:02:00.680]  job uh and i'm happy that they didn't uh they ignored me because they thought i'm just a
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:07.720]  middle-aged lady who who you know is spouting off but i was able to confront both of them and tell
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:12.360]  them well they don't think you're a middle-aged lady doesn't have power you're a middle-aged lady
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:16.360]  who does have power and they know they're been confronted all over the place and it lets them
[2:02:16.360 --> 2:02:23.480]  know that we know well i i also i've corresponded with text mars for about 10 years i'm a bible
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:30.280]  college graduate i went to ucla on a state scholarship all of that is to say that alex when
[2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:37.160]  you're talking about the analysis of evil um i want to bring out that there have been
[2:02:37.160 --> 2:02:48.600]  uh supernatural uh messages from god's kingdom coming to people to my knowledge at least from
[2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:58.520]  the early 1800s and one of the messages was in 1864 saying that the demons from hell had been
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:09.480]  unchained in the world and that this was the hour that we need to pray now i'm not a catholic
[2:03:09.480 --> 2:03:16.200]  i've never been a catholic but these messages are what have been called marion apparitions
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:25.320]  today is the nativity or the birthday according to you know this teaching of the virgin mary
[2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:38.280]  and if you're talking about fatima or fatima in 1917 or select france in 1846 i know a lot
[2:03:38.280 --> 2:03:42.680]  of people are really into that i don't have i've never really i've never i've never been into it
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:48.760]  at all alex but but we have no i'm just saying because i'm not catholic and i i don't think
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:54.040]  about that i'm not catholic either and i know that the communists and the masons infiltrated
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:58.840]  the catholics no i know i was just saying that i don't really earlier i was just trying to say
[2:03:58.840 --> 2:04:02.360]  i don't know about i've heard about that stuff i just don't know the details is what i was saying
[2:04:03.080 --> 2:04:06.280]  well i've done a little study of it in the past couple of months
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:11.720]  and i really think that when we're discussing evil and we're saying it's up to ourselves
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:20.040]  it really is up to prayer and we do what we can but we also have the host of heaven on our side
[2:04:20.040 --> 2:04:28.600]  if we will call out to them and i'm praying the rosary every day i'm sorry i am well uh i mean
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:33.240]  who's criticizing you for that i mean i don't uh this radio broadcast is about confronting the

[2:08:01.240 --> 2:08:03.560]  that she was getting into catholic mysticism
[2:08:05.800 --> 2:08:10.280]  i'm not your judge lady it's between you and god what you do i'm not here judging catholics
[2:08:11.240 --> 2:08:17.160]  baptists you know there are good people that love god in all these groups i'm not here to judge you
[2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:23.560]  this is not a religious show i talk about my belief in god my relationship with a creator i'm with
[2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:29.160]  life i'm with creativity i'm with uh goodness and i'm gonna stand up against deception and evil
[2:08:29.160 --> 2:08:35.240]  and darkness but i'm not going to sit here and and and judge you so don't call in apologizing
[2:08:35.240 --> 2:08:43.560]  to me for what you're doing uh you sound like a nice person and uh you know people hold me up like this
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:51.160]  this big icon uh to either you know for me to criticize them or to give them some go ahead
[2:08:51.880 --> 2:08:56.200]  that's not going to happen here i don't get into mysticism myself
[2:08:58.280 --> 2:09:02.040]  and by that i don't uh get on air and
[2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:11.160]  say i believe because of this prophecy this a b m c is going to happen
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:15.080]  or i don't get on air and say
[2:09:17.960 --> 2:09:21.880]  well i know i certainly don't believe in things like nostradamus but people call in and you know
[2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:31.800]  bring it up but i'm not discounting all of it but i'm also you know i'm just standing on facts
[2:09:31.800 --> 2:09:35.880]  and what i can prove when people get confused they go but you cover bohemian growth but you
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:42.440]  cover the occult you cover satanism running things from a secular perspective which means
[2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:48.680]  without god doesn't mean i'm not with god it means that i without god without bringing the
[2:09:48.680 --> 2:09:54.200]  debate in which which which then becomes a big furball everybody fights over
[2:09:57.240 --> 2:10:03.400]  i'm simply saying look if you are an atheist an agnostic a baptist a buddhist a hindu whatever
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:11.560]  you are let's stop debating whose religions real or what the bedrock facts are because people can
[2:10:11.560 --> 2:10:19.160]  ever get past that let's debate what does the ruling elite believe let's look at their psychology
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:25.640]  their pathology what makes them tick what do they believe it and an atheist or some of the most
[2:10:25.640 --> 2:10:31.320]  closed-minded people you'll find they'll say there is no satanic elite there are no rituals going on
[2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:37.720]  you're crazy for even covering it you're your nuts and i'm going well so as i say the aztecs
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:42.520]  did rituals that didn't exist because religion doesn't exist i'm not debating whether there's
[2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:48.040]  a wing at serpent god i'm not debating whether there's a sun god or a mountain god or a water
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:56.200]  god or a corn god or a snake god or a monkey god or a jaguar god i'm saying did the aztecs believe
[2:10:56.200 --> 2:11:02.680]  in those gods and did they order their life around that and the stars i'm not debating
[2:11:02.680 --> 2:11:09.880]  whether zeus is real i'm not debating whether hercules was his son i'm not debating whether
[2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:14.040]  ulysses sailed around in the Mediterranean and killed giants
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:19.080]  that had sirens sing to him
[2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:25.000]  i'm not debating whether he got away from the cyclops by holding on to the bottom of the
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:31.400]  giant sheep's bellies i'm saying did the greeks believe that did the aztecs believe their own
[2:11:31.400 --> 2:11:36.760]  myths did the romans believe in jupiter and satyr
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:46.200]  did the israelites believe in jahovar yaw and the other side lucifer the devil satan yes
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:54.280]  so the question is what does our elite believe what was do we have a cult running our society
[2:11:54.280 --> 2:12:00.120]  are they a blood cult a sex cult a yin yang cult that believes in destruction and rebirth
[2:12:00.120 --> 2:12:03.960]  but if you really look at them they really are into death and power they can claim they're both
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:08.600]  which is bad because it always leads to the destructive taking over that's just a historical
[2:12:08.600 --> 2:12:12.760]  fact and so whether you believe in that or not the elite do and believe they're deriving power from
[2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:21.800]  it and so that is the discussion that we are having here today
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:32.120]  that is the point that i was bringing up now we may see incredible things in the near future
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:38.360]  we've already seen something three football fields long repeatedly flying around above
[2:12:38.360 --> 2:12:45.320]  the suburbs of dallas and dentin and surrounding areas f-16 is chasing it giant flying saucers
[2:12:45.320 --> 2:12:53.720]  over the capital giant flying saucers over chicago over detroit i mean we're seeing things three
[2:12:53.720 --> 2:13:04.040]  football fields long that just disappear i don't know what that is and because it becomes in the
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:12.280]  realm of magic and mysticism or what you'd call religion and because i can't prove it one way
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:17.880]  or the other i i don't i don't really cover it i don't really talk about it here because
[2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:23.240]  it's hard enough to get the public to admit that they're putting aids virus hiv
[2:13:25.640 --> 2:13:33.160]  hepatitis hundreds of different fast-acting aggressive cancer viruses and vaccines your
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:37.640]  body fights some of them off they embed keep replicating what finally kills you a decade later
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:41.960]  i mean this is hardcore stuff and that's all admitted i mean it's an absolute fact that
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:46.520]  sodium fluoride the type they put in the water isn't just deadly because the fluoride but the
[2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:52.840]  mercury the lead all the rest of it they legally put in there can't get the public to resist that
[2:13:53.800 --> 2:13:58.440]  so i don't know what's going on everybody's calling me about this stuff the news is hyping it
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:02.440]  the speaking of the catholics the popes come out and said aliens are real they're gonna land and
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:07.000]  basically they're brothers with jesus or something all these other religious leaders are saying it
[2:14:08.760 --> 2:14:13.320]  conservative leaders are calling for global warming taxes and world government pat robertson
[2:14:13.320 --> 2:14:17.640]  i mean everything's getting turned on its head right now they've got all these astronauts coming
[2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:21.960]  out and saying flying saucers are real we're in contact with aliens eisenhower met with them
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:31.800]  it's on cnn msnbc i don't know but i know from past information but i can't say what this is i
[2:14:31.800 --> 2:14:37.640]  don't know don't have enough data i were collating don't worry we're no robbie the robot just says
[2:14:37.640 --> 2:14:42.440]  danger will robinson and i'm getting ready to spit something out here but the point is i know
[2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:50.760]  there are declassified and fragments of declassified programs with the federal government developing
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:57.240]  gigantic holograms that can project it just so happens when i first saw reports of this in the
[2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:13.080]  late 90s 900 foot tall and larger buddha jesus flying saucers and then how big
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:20.360]  are these flying saucers we're seeing 600 feet 900 feet a thousand feet and they blip right out the
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:29.080]  phoenix lights look just like holograms in mexico city they keep seeing big flying saucers and then
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:33.640]  people even seen what looks like projectors on buildings that are wheeled out to do it and they
[2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:38.280]  wheel them back people see these beams of light through cloud covered in things nearby
[2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:43.560]  they want to try to unify us claiming there's an outside threat
[2:15:43.560 --> 2:15:51.320]  as enrique cinger said you know a fake alien invasion but then we're out in the middle of
[2:15:51.320 --> 2:15:57.560]  nowhere we're out in the middle of the cosmos i certainly am not naive enough to believe
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:16:02.600]  we're the only life in the universe even in this dimension we're in the mathematics shows scores
[2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:07.720]  of dimensions but again i don't totally get into that because i can't prove it one way or the other
[2:16:07.720 --> 2:16:14.760]  i just know this type of stuff is on tv every day and mainstream media is covering bigfoot's
[2:16:15.320 --> 2:16:21.320]  they're covering chuber cabras they're covering devil dogs they're covering blue dogs they're
[2:16:21.320 --> 2:16:28.200]  covering hillside monsters they're covering flying saucers somebody flip the switch and it's
[2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:32.600]  like they're going into la la land reporting to where people don't know what's true anymore
[2:16:32.600 --> 2:16:37.080]  kind of a background noise so i'm going they're putting cancer viruses in that's all proven but
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:43.960]  people go yeah they'll even see it in says there's blue devil dogs in new jersey even fox says that's
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:49.080]  all whatever kind of just they want you now just to tune out they want a background noise
[2:16:49.080 --> 2:16:52.040]  says that i don't know what's going on i'm kind of answering the question here but
[2:16:52.040 --> 2:16:57.160]  i can't be sure of that maybe these are real flying saucers no i i wrote my gut tells me
[2:16:57.160 --> 2:17:03.720]  they're not my gut tells me they're not here's a little msnbc piece a former astronaut who
[2:17:03.720 --> 2:17:08.600]  walked on the moon says aliens exist and that the government has been covering up incidents of
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:14.840]  contact for years now dr edgard michel says aliens have visited our planet and he believes the
[2:17:14.840 --> 2:17:21.000]  government covered up the discovery of an alien spacecraft in 1947 as well as four alien bodies
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:28.120]  that were found in the desert the reason for the denial it was number one we didn't they didn't know
[2:17:28.120 --> 2:17:33.720]  if these were hostile and could we uh protect ourselves from them didn't want the soviets to know
[2:17:33.720 --> 2:17:41.160]  so they could advise to lie about it and covered up well dr michel is a veteran of the apollo 14
[2:17:41.160 --> 2:17:48.440]  mission and he walked on the moon back in february of 1971 and uh he says the president hangs out
[2:17:48.440 --> 2:17:53.080]  with the three-foot gray aliens you can go see the full interviews if you want basically
[2:17:53.080 --> 2:18:02.920]  i'll say this if they are really humanoid aliens uh they can come across the cosmos but they crash
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:07.880]  land in tinfoil spaceships if they are they're just some genetically engineered thing we were
[2:18:07.880 --> 2:18:15.080]  meant to find a little tin can thing that crashes but see now i'm forced because cnn fox msnbc
[2:18:15.080 --> 2:18:22.360]  wall-to-wall coverage with the disclosure project openly run by the rockfellers and the cia roth
[2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:29.320]  child one of them heads it and they're just saying you know off base colonies aliens are about to land
[2:18:29.320 --> 2:18:34.120]  who knows they could have genetically engineered some green-skinned humanoid in the 30 years of human
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:38.200]  cloning that's now admitted to be going on oh yeah you didn't know it's admitted cloning for human
[2:18:38.200 --> 2:18:44.760]  cloning for decades i see paul out there with his mouth hanging open uh type in uh human clones
[2:18:44.760 --> 2:18:54.200]  and click google news see they introduced it uh publicly in 1997 bbc and then reported that in
[2:18:54.200 --> 2:19:00.600]  the last 20 years human clones but the embryonic level had been made but had been killed so let
[2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:06.760]  me see 1997 and saying in the last 20 years classified programs 97 was 11 years so see the
[2:19:06.760 --> 2:19:12.840]  last 30 years 11 and 20s but see now they're introducing to the slaves which they've been
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:19.160]  doing for at least 30 they cross humans type in a human pig hybrid paul
[2:19:21.640 --> 2:19:26.360]  see all just calmly reported but they mix it in with the oh by the way somebody saw bigfoot
[2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:31.640]  by the way there's a three-foot ball field flying saucer flying over dallas

[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:14.600]  on tv folks in the fourth hour he googled human animal hybrid the first hit is snopes the urban
[2:24:14.600 --> 2:24:22.680]  legend site and they say doesn't exist not real it's fake then you read the bottom it's a photo
[2:24:22.680 --> 2:24:29.160]  from a british newspaper it was an artist rendering of a human animal hybrid and the whole thing is
[2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:37.240]  about that being fake so then it gives the illusion that there aren't animal human hybrids though you
[2:24:37.240 --> 2:24:43.800]  got bbc london telegraph associated press washington post all admit it doesn't matter
[2:24:43.800 --> 2:24:50.280]  just like snopes says there's no chinese organ harvesting and then they'll use one or two discredited
[2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:59.960]  reports to straw man that'd be like if i was before the queen of spain queen isabella and i was uh
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:04.120]  and i had cheated her and not taken the money she gave me and i hadn't done an expedition looking
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:13.080]  for the indies looking for a uh western passage to the east to the spice islands
[2:25:13.080 --> 2:25:20.680]  if i if i came back and said uh oh yes it was a fabulous island in the middle but there were
[2:25:20.680 --> 2:25:25.400]  sea monsters and we couldn't get to it then i could be disproven to be a liar lying about an
[2:25:25.400 --> 2:25:31.800]  island with sea monsters and then say that the that the western passage didn't exist but in truth
[2:25:31.800 --> 2:25:37.640]  the western passage did exist you just run into north america what a weird analogy or parallel or
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:46.360]  a parable point is is that the americas were there the western passage was there
[2:25:47.240 --> 2:25:51.960]  but if i make it up and say there was no fabulous island of mermaids and mermen
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:57.640]  then i've lied so see that's what they do there's all this admission of human animal hybrids
[2:25:58.840 --> 2:26:03.880]  been going on for decades they use them for body parts they use them for transplantation
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:07.080]  they use it to create a pig that's basically got a human heart so they can cut the heart out
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:13.000]  people morally say that lets me live i don't care the problem is it creates new zoological
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:18.520]  viruses and bacteria it also creates major ethical questions now they're making the hybrids more
[2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:23.720]  closely associated with having more human genetics they admit they've got a half chimpanzee half
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:30.760]  humanoid line for at least a decade out of argentina down in south america coast orica
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:35.880]  it's got some facilities and the real facilities don't show the public they publish in scientific
[2:26:35.880 --> 2:26:43.320]  journals scientists go and peer review it and it's big money but it doesn't matter that's
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:47.240]  why i get emails saying you're a liar there's no human animal hybrids because they read snopes
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:56.520]  now snopes the urban legend site is saying that photo which no one ever said the photo was real
[2:26:56.520 --> 2:27:03.560]  it was a i remember when it first came out a few years ago it was a pig part human part pig
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:09.880]  creature it wasn't a british newspaper that said artist rendering but see snopes then takes that
[2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:18.520]  definitely on the dark side and just pacifies oh it's not real don't get involved oh no no no
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:24.840]  there's no so i have a guy coming from a pizza place and say you're a liar there's no cross species
[2:27:24.840 --> 2:27:34.360]  i had biology at ut in the seventies so see they know you're halfway listening so they just throw
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:38.760]  it out there thinking you won't notice all right i gotta get to your calls here i apologize uh
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:44.680]  steven alabama than richard jake don david another's go ahead to steve uh good stuff today alex
[2:27:44.680 --> 2:27:50.760]  i love the way you uh navigate between all these various topics here um let me throw this one at
[2:27:50.760 --> 2:27:59.000]  you uh last night on a 60 minutes bob woodward uh good interview uh was talking about the iraq war
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:08.680]  and he uh implied that the u.s. military had developed some new cutting-edge um tactic for
[2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:15.080]  um assassinating people uh for taking out these you know quote al-qaeda leaders and so on uh can
[2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:19.560]  you speculate as in he of course he didn't you know he couldn't provide any more details although it
[2:28:19.560 --> 2:28:24.040]  seemed like he he implied that he knew what those details it's everything they've got they've got
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:28.760]  ground penetrating radar that gives them a crisp image and they just fire different gamma rays
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:34.920]  microwaves uh particle beams are very cheap and inexpensive now they've got uh jets flying around
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:41.880]  uh with uh radiation beams is basically what they are so it's not a particle beam and it is
[2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:46.360]  a particle beam but it's a radiation beam it's kind of like a directed uh same stuff that comes
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:54.120]  out of neutron bombs kind of like many x-ray lasers and uh they've also got uh all sorts of
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:58.680]  race specific bio weapons but they can get somebody's dna they can make it just for them
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:05.720]  uh they've got uh you just all sorts of new assassination tools they're not really killing
[2:29:05.720 --> 2:29:11.640]  al-qaeda that means anybody that doesn't give them an oil contract anybody that doesn't roll over
[2:29:11.640 --> 2:29:18.600]  the surge wasn't about putting 15 000 more troops in the surge was just going in with buckets of cash
[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:25.000]  multi-million dollar payments to each neighborhood warlord every every month and that's all publicly
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:31.160]  admitted so the surge was they they broke up the military they got rid of the bath this they let
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:36.360]  civil war break out then they just paid everybody off to stop it oh let me explain how we get back

[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:23.000]  we were talking to steven alabama finish your point steve uh that was really the whole of the
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:28.600]  question alex i just wanted your analysis on that um ask the question again i was asked 20
[2:33:28.600 --> 2:33:33.160]  questions during the three minute break and i actually forgot what it was just the uh the
[2:33:33.160 --> 2:33:39.000]  tactics that the uh military was using to uh you know these cutting-edge tactics to supposedly
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:45.240]  take out uh terrorists and such yeah cutting-edge tactics is all the that's why the globalists
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:50.360]  are so arrogant uh you know they say if we ever try to revolt and peacefully take our government
[2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:54.680]  back i mean even if congress came out and said it's a new world order we're kicking the shadow
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:33:59.640]  government out in five minutes a neutron bomb would be dropped on washington and i mean they
[2:33:59.640 --> 2:34:04.200]  say that's what they're doing they're saying we have a scientific dictatorship you are never
[2:34:04.200 --> 2:34:09.720]  going to stop us the only way to stop them is full education the military the police before
[2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:14.920]  and they're only about six seven years away from this before there is a robotic force
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:19.240]  uh working for the new world order and then they're not even gonna need the military anymore
[2:34:19.240 --> 2:34:24.040]  do you understand it'll all be pre-programmed and run by these supercomputers and that's not
[2:34:24.040 --> 2:34:28.920]  from the movie terminator folks this is what they're really setting up perhaps i should lay out
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:37.320]  really the master plan anything else uh just one other quick thing uh unrelated which was
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:41.640]  that the uh i was wondering if you knew when you were going to announce the winners of the
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:46.520]  declaration of independence oh man contest that is a great question i appreciate your call here's
[2:34:46.520 --> 2:34:53.480]  the deal uh three days after the first contest that was for three thousand dollars there were
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:35:02.440]  two contests for three thousand total three days after the the contest closed i announced the winners
[2:35:04.280 --> 2:35:08.040]  and then my personnel so small i had to scratch around trying to get the contact info the winners
[2:35:08.040 --> 2:35:13.320]  and i'm told they've been paid i really bit off more than i could chew with this other contest
[2:35:13.320 --> 2:35:21.000]  that's five thousand dollars for the best viral video what is it two thousand for the best declaration
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:29.080]  of independence one thousand for the best bill of particulars and we got hundreds and hundreds
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:37.720]  and hundreds and hundreds of essays hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and i was up at
[2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:47.240]  two a.m. saturday night trying to because it's not fair to not read all the essays i'm like a
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:52.120]  teacher i was like a class of like 500 people basically and i've got to grade the test is what
[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:58.520]  it i didn't know what i was getting into and i it's not fair but i mean i'm to the point where i
[2:35:58.520 --> 2:36:04.520]  may have to just have a stack of them and then just reach in and grab one out but but then
[2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:09.000]  that's not fair because i want the best one to be the one that gets all the attention
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:17.720]  i mean nimo posted like 80 of them or something and and couldn't even give them all their own
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:20.840]  page you didn't have the time he had too many other duties and they were just kind of all
[2:36:20.840 --> 2:36:26.920]  slopped on there and i was watching scores of videos and i'm not whining does anybody have an
[2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:31.800]  idea of how to do this because i keep procrastinating i keep trying to go back and then he's like
[2:36:31.800 --> 2:36:36.280]  and there and he's like a hundred more or something came in after the deadline what do i do and
[2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:40.040]  i'm like well i want you to redo prism planet dot com with another new design
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:43.320]  that's supposed to launch later this week and i want you to do this and i'm giving army
[2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:48.280]  orders to armies that don't exist i mean i don't make my employees work more than eight
[2:36:48.280 --> 2:36:53.880]  hours a day but erin's been working about 15 16 a day the last week so much he wants to do
[2:36:53.880 --> 2:37:01.640]  robson working about 1214 a day uh that's why i'm not going to new york you know i said i wasn't
[2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:07.560]  going and they begged for me to go and i wanted to go and then the cuda grass was family that's
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:13.000]  got pancreatic cancer who knows how long they'll be alive you don't live very long with that normally
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:17.640]  i'm not going to get into details family lessons and the point is is that um
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:21.800]  i gotta go visit my great uncle
[2:37:21.800 --> 2:37:30.360]  my grandfather had four brothers and he is the last of them so it's like my dad's daddy
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:37.160]  basically that's just my dad's father figure after his dad died uh and uh
[2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:44.120]  uh you know what it is a family is not coming first in my life but it's gotta come second
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:47.000]  third or fourth at least so i just you know i'm not going to new york
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:54.840]  and people will be mad at me for that but i am promoting with banners and links and stories the
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:37:59.640]  events i am linking to all the we are change videos i'd have to try to get my listeners to
[2:37:59.640 --> 2:38:07.000]  raise money for them i'm doing everything i can i was also invited out to speak with jesse
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:12.040]  ventura in nevada or is it arizona excuse me i'm not going to that
[2:38:12.040 --> 2:38:18.840]  i've been so busy i haven't even promoted this jesse ventura slash willy nelson thing
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:22.840]  jesse says he's coming to austin willie told me to do it all
[2:38:24.280 --> 2:38:28.200]  and i've just been so busy with everything else that the event set up the time is set up
[2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:41.240]  up and uh i gotta work on that when i get off air today so i can announce it in the next few weeks
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:47.480]  there's a time when jewels even lose their luster that line from conan
[2:38:47.480 --> 2:38:57.640]  when the throne room becomes a prison when gems lose their luster and only a father's
[2:38:57.640 --> 2:39:03.400]  love for his daughter matters i mean but it's the opposite i'm not bummed out and unhappy
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:09.640]  i'm not unexcited about knowing willy nelson or jesse ventura or events
[2:39:09.640 --> 2:39:17.480]  it's just that i'm so energized with understanding the nature of humanity the nature of the elites
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:21.960]  how the globalist operate different ways they manipulate people thousands of different ways
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:25.640]  they do it how their systems i mean i i've got such an understanding now
[2:39:25.640 --> 2:39:29.000]  that it's like trying to put the amount of information in a fire hose through a pixie straw
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:39.960]  and i'm just marveling at the beast marveling also at god's creation
[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:44.280]  i'm like a fool on a hill watching the world spin around
[2:39:48.280 --> 2:39:53.400]  but i'm not a fool on the hill people just think that's a fool sitting under the tree
[2:39:53.400 --> 2:40:00.120]  but the fool on the hill watches the world spinning around
[2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:06.360]  and the fool on the hill i forget how it goes at beetle song
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:10.520]  i mean i really am losing my ego
[2:40:12.840 --> 2:40:18.280]  and when i talk about myself me me me i i i i i'm telling you about my journey because i
[2:40:18.280 --> 2:40:24.040]  know humans are all basically alike and so i'm talking about your journey our journey together
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:32.200]  see you got me off on a jag and i i i need to go to your calls here poor nice people waiting and
[2:40:32.200 --> 2:40:42.360]  i'm just babbling so i don't know what to do i mean when you read like 20 30 40 essays
[2:40:42.360 --> 2:40:48.040]  you just get exhausted and there's like 50 60 70 more and then you can't judge which one's the best
[2:40:48.040 --> 2:40:53.160]  you know when it got down to the last contest the best two or three videos you know took me
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:40:57.400]  like an hour of watching them over and over again to decide i really want to judge this properly
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:04.200]  i don't know but then if i don't do this i'm gonna end up procrastinating and it's never gonna happen
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:07.960]  i don't know what to do
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:11.960]  i don't know what to do i don't know what to do
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:29.960]  i don't know i put my foot in my mouth but hey nothing succeeds like success
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:35.000]  i wanted hundreds of videos to go viral i wanted hundreds of essays and ideas and
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:40.200]  to get you to write so we've succeeded we've gotten information about liberty and freedom and
[2:41:40.200 --> 2:41:44.440]  also the government corruption out we've made all these films these videos and somebody's
[2:41:44.440 --> 2:41:49.800]  going to win the prize i just am trying to do justice to it and i don't know how to do it
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:53.880]  i guess i could just keep asking the question do you guys out there any of the four of you
[2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:58.200]  i'm looking at you at the window have any idea of how i'm supposed to judge hundreds of essays and
[2:41:58.200 --> 2:42:06.840]  videos we're too successful i mean i i mean i've spent hours and hours and hours i've probably
[2:42:06.840 --> 2:42:12.920]  sat down three times trying to judge this and i it's like it's like trying to chop down a forest
[2:42:12.920 --> 2:42:17.320]  you're but you know with a hatchet and i can focus for an hour and chop down one tree and
[2:42:17.320 --> 2:42:24.200]  then i'm exhausted i mean what am i supposed to do here maybe i'm supposed to lie and pick one
[2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:30.760]  randomly but not say it was random but see i don't do that i try to not lie she lying makes it easy
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:40.360]  doesn't it huh you got any ideas how do i judge hundreds of essays and videos how do i do it tell
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:55.720]  me no ideas huh no ideas i mean i got you guys on the hot seat here well i want you guys i'm
[2:42:55.720 --> 2:43:02.520]  asking you out there how do i judge this do i break it up into like everybody in the office
[2:43:02.520 --> 2:43:08.280]  having to read 20 of them or 15 of them and then come to me with the one best essay or the one best
[2:43:08.280 --> 2:43:13.560]  video and maybe you have two or three of you come up with the same one but then there's too many for
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:18.360]  one of you to watch i'm saying that won't work is that to give it to you in quadrants like you're
[2:43:18.360 --> 2:43:24.280]  one through 30 and you're 30 through 60 and you're 60 through 90 and you're 90 through 120 on this essay
[2:43:24.280 --> 2:43:30.440]  and there's a hundred and something of this essay you want to do it that way how's that sound
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:39.560]  you see that's knowledge see i had the knowledge to know we'd get a bunch of essays and a bunch
[2:43:39.560 --> 2:43:42.840]  of articles and a bunch of content that would be thought-provoking and to be thought-provoking
[2:43:42.840 --> 2:43:46.840]  to get you the listener to become engaged and write that new declaration of independence so
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:43:51.560]  that's how you all are winners and then we would get all these videos made about internet censorship
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:56.840]  to expose that was happening and we'll also promote our websites see i had the knowledge
[2:43:56.840 --> 2:44:03.960]  that that would happen but did i have the wisdom to think this could really be a huge response
[2:44:03.960 --> 2:44:08.840]  and then how do i judge this see that's that's wisdom and i had the wisdom if i would have
[2:44:08.840 --> 2:44:14.040]  used the wisdom but i was in a hot passion on air being censored and boarded out an idea
[2:44:15.240 --> 2:44:21.960]  doesn't matter it succeeds all right that's it uh richard and texas let's go faster richard and
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:28.120]  texas fast one call every 30 minute committee of the prism planet dot com subscribers and
[2:44:28.120 --> 2:44:32.680]  divvy those things out to people to judge or something but that does sound like an overwhelming
[2:44:32.680 --> 2:44:38.600]  task you've you made a bed for yourself didn't you i did but then they'll accuse it of people
[2:44:38.600 --> 2:44:45.320]  voting for themselves and you know it'll turn into a big suffrage you can't win listen i i
[2:44:45.320 --> 2:44:50.840]  assume you may be aware of the difficulties that the jeff rent side has had over the weekend and
[2:44:50.840 --> 2:44:55.800]  that seems to be indicative along with uh oh things like the arrest of amy goodman and that
[2:44:55.800 --> 2:45:02.920]  sort of thing of kind of moving the uh uh bar up another notch in terms of oppression of alternate
[2:45:02.920 --> 2:45:07.800]  media and uh and truthers and that sort of thing well i like jeff and we've promoted him and had
[2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:13.880]  him on here and i've had him on one time his website was down and uh it was because it's his
[2:45:13.880 --> 2:45:17.560]  hard drive died i said wasn't it backed up and he said yeah it was supposed to be it wasn't
[2:45:17.560 --> 2:45:22.520]  and i said well i i've got it people you know we could help you but i think it was kind of
[2:45:22.520 --> 2:45:25.720]  hourly and so it was down for like a week because he didn't take our help
[2:45:27.800 --> 2:45:31.560]  now he's saying this is an attack when somebody has your code we've had this
[2:45:31.560 --> 2:45:35.960]  and goes in and turns your servers off and then orders them to erase the backup that's an attack
[2:45:35.960 --> 2:45:42.680]  or when somebody says fu on your own website and post a naked uh stripper on the front of it
[2:45:42.680 --> 2:45:48.200]  you know and we've had that happen so we have been hacked we've had denial of service uh and
[2:45:48.200 --> 2:45:51.880]  and you know we had to go to cds and backups and spend tens of thousands of months to keep
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:56.360]  them up thank god let's support us or we wouldn't be here so i have no doubt that rinse doesn't get
[2:45:56.360 --> 2:46:00.920]  attacked uh i just can't really help him because he doesn't take my advice so yeah i don't know
[2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:05.400]  what kind of backup system he's got now he was down for much of the weekend this weekend and he
[2:46:05.400 --> 2:46:11.000]  seems to understand however he's basing his uh judgment on that the attacks are coming from
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:16.440]  the highest levels of of some sort or another well you can uh you can help somebody and they'll
[2:46:16.440 --> 2:46:22.120]  take your help yeah well i just also wanted to mention uh alex the depth of the uh the rabbit
[2:46:22.120 --> 2:46:28.360]  hole just gets more and more difficult to try to understand you know the enrichment of all the key
[2:46:28.360 --> 2:46:34.200]  players in the world uh on the stage right now by the huge increase in the price of oil that we've
[2:46:34.200 --> 2:46:40.920]  seen over the last year so whether it be putin or shaves or i am deniged or the u s or the u
[2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:46.040]  k all of these players are reaping the benefits of that and you know every time they rattle their
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:50.600]  sabers or make noise or send ships out and that sort of thing more money flows as a result that's
[2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:55.400]  right it's it's the governments of the world together raping the people it's an unwritten rule
[2:46:55.400 --> 2:47:01.800]  it's a mystery of evil just like from the person buying a home to the real estate agent to the
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:07.160]  broker to the appraiser to the inspector uh to the bank to the broker to the mortgage into the
[2:47:07.160 --> 2:47:13.080]  government to fanny may freddy mac it was fraud unwritten just a criminal society and and that's
[2:47:13.080 --> 2:47:17.080]  the way governments are 99 percent of the time they're corrupt their dirtbags they're full of
[2:47:17.080 --> 2:47:23.240]  propaganda and governments just like democrats attack republicans and republicans get mad and
[2:47:23.240 --> 2:47:28.360]  say i got to defend my party right or wrong so the democrats pop the republicans up and republicans
[2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:33.000]  attack democrats democrats say well i know those republicans are bad uh so the democrats must be
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:39.240]  good they prop them up well see just because the u.s is bad akmed denigide must be good no they're all
[2:47:39.240 --> 2:47:45.160]  bad just because the u.s is run by crooks and nato is doesn't mean putin's good so see then the
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:50.920]  establishment says okay then choose sides whose interest is it best for you to support and now
[2:47:50.920 --> 2:47:56.280]  you've done the lesser of two evils now you've joined in to what has brought man down see there
[2:47:56.280 --> 2:48:03.720]  is the basic equation that is what is yeah it's interesting how putin's being elevated uh in terms
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:09.560]  of the eyes of the general population of the planet uh and as well in his own country um as as kind
[2:48:09.560 --> 2:48:14.280]  of a savior and the uh anti-new world order guy and that sort of thing how long you've been listening
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:20.040]  to my show oh tons of time so for years alex i'm a mom i'm listening did you hear me in 2002 say
[2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:25.640]  the united states will go in and i said in 2003 i mean go listen to the show the day of the attack
[2:48:25.640 --> 2:48:30.280]  in mid-march and i'm not bragging i don't have the time the energy with the archives i know they're
[2:48:30.280 --> 2:48:35.080]  out there i'm asking youtube listeners to do this and put it together for me just to show people
[2:48:35.080 --> 2:48:39.880]  that i'm not playing games okay i understand the enemy operation this is what i've said what happened
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:45.080]  the united states will bombard the country they will dismantle the government they will break
[2:48:45.080 --> 2:48:49.000]  it in three parts effectively and have civil war for five six seven years
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:56.040]  then they will uh basically pay off the different sides breaking into partitions

[3:13:19.480 --> 3:13:26.760]  clips first here is a lou dobbs report on most of the votes in the senate being secret now
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:33.880]  no they always had roll call they always recorded how they voted now they just won't even tell you
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:38.520]  but what you know is is they've got a nine percent approval rating and they vote
[3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:42.280]  almost a hundred percent of the time against the constitution and what's popular see
[3:13:42.280 --> 3:13:47.880]  that's a little cue you're not in a free country when you don't like the war how about we expand it
[3:13:47.880 --> 3:13:52.520]  oh you don't like open borders how about we do it oh you don't oh we're going to radiate
[3:13:52.520 --> 3:13:56.040]  all your food oh you don't like it we'll just have all the migrants crap all over the food
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:14:03.880]  and then when you get trichinosis and when you get hepatitis and when you get all these other
[3:14:05.960 --> 3:14:10.760]  salmonella and a bunch of you die then we'll just we'll just shut down all the us farms
[3:14:10.760 --> 3:14:14.520]  that's what happened the regulators came in and shut out a bunch of us tomato and pepper
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:17.960]  farms and then a year later they admitted what we already told you so she didn't press oh it was the
[3:14:19.080 --> 3:14:21.320]  raw sewage being sprayed on stuff in mexico but
[3:14:21.320 --> 3:14:26.680]  you know the tomato and pepper farmers are already out of business and spinach
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:33.080]  because the public so stupid they were told it was the stuff was only safe it was from mexico
[3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:39.640]  it always works oh it's so good to screw everybody oh it's so much fun to be idiots and be lied to
[3:14:40.280 --> 3:14:45.080]  go ahead and play the ludobbs admitting i mean even on cnn flaunting oh yeah it's a secret
[3:14:45.080 --> 3:14:51.480]  vote but you think ludobbs is telling you something here but he almost legitimizes it the way he it
[3:14:51.480 --> 3:14:56.520]  doesn't matter everything's fine having the votes be secrets good here it is senate's practice
[3:14:56.520 --> 3:15:03.720]  of passing critical legislation in absolute secret without public debate a staggering 94
[3:15:03.720 --> 3:15:11.560]  percent of all senate legislation is passed with no debate no discussion at all of the policy
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:17.800]  or how your tax money is spent tonight one leading senator is demanding that the government become
[3:15:17.800 --> 3:15:24.040]  somewhat accountable to american taxpayers imagine that lisa sequester with our report
[3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:31.160]  the bickering on capitol hill that's enough new heights that's like that texas legislature clip
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:34.840]  we've got where it says it's illegal for you to vote for somebody else or to vote twice
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:39.240]  and they don't care the state senate in the house they'll just sit there hitting the button voting
[3:15:39.240 --> 3:15:43.640]  over and over again and it's everybody like it's a video game you know when you're beating the level
[3:15:43.640 --> 3:15:52.600]  boss where you just hit the button as fast as you can just criminal running wild and i'm telling you
[3:15:52.600 --> 3:15:57.640]  folks no country no civilization's ever gotten this corrupt because they just invented new levels
[3:15:57.640 --> 3:16:03.640]  of corruption and new scams and crap here's an example out the middle of these ghost towns little
[3:16:03.640 --> 3:16:08.840]  towns poor cities you don't see cops you come into places like denver or austin or where there's
[3:16:08.840 --> 3:16:15.000]  money it's just cops everywhere there to suck blood they go wherever the money's that i mean it's
[3:16:15.000 --> 3:16:21.480]  folks the legislatures are criminals the congress are criminals now the house is having secret
[3:16:21.480 --> 3:16:24.760]  sessions they've had like three in their whole history now they're having them all the time
[3:16:26.520 --> 3:16:30.360]  i've got clips about secret sessions i don't have time to play all of this
[3:16:31.160 --> 3:16:36.040]  for you the point is is that it's completely lawless by the way you know who writes the
[3:16:36.040 --> 3:16:41.640]  bills you heard 94 percent they never read they never debate the lobbyist who and there's certain
[3:16:41.640 --> 3:16:46.440]  lobbyists that you know that literally own certain senators and they just come in and say what is it
[3:16:46.440 --> 3:16:51.960]  freddo here it is and they'll just give it to them that's kind of like they did pass a law and wrote
[3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:55.880]  island but then it got repealed overnight and said criticizing government life in prison
[3:16:57.480 --> 3:17:01.880]  and the lobbyist with homeland security a federal lobbyist you know the feds have lobbyists
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:06.440]  wrote it see that you want to know what the feds want they want to put you in jail be disagree with
[3:17:06.440 --> 3:17:12.200]  them and now they're doing it they charged a bunch of people who were nonviolent with terrorism in
[3:17:13.080 --> 3:17:19.960]  minneapolis st paul last week we played the newscast clips where they calmly like they're
[3:17:19.960 --> 3:17:25.720]  talking about the price of a new radiator or the price of lettuce just oh yeah we're charging them
[3:17:25.720 --> 3:17:31.480]  with terrorism they'll get 25 years in prison 30 years in prison apiece and uh that's just the end
[3:17:31.480 --> 3:17:36.280]  of it and oh yeah some of them are reporters yeah and see the public hears them goes well you better

[3:23:24.040 --> 3:23:32.520]  you
[3:23:38.680 --> 3:23:44.840]  boss fog about 150 years ago just let me know hired high tech scientist
[3:23:44.840 --> 3:23:52.440]  mind warfare is what they call it to figure out how to brainwash and dumb the population down
[3:23:54.040 --> 3:24:04.760]  and develop 21st century propaganda and now they got it and they are using it
[3:24:04.760 --> 3:24:14.840]  imagine they took these mortgages these these debts they tricked us that's how we've got to
[3:24:14.840 --> 3:24:20.840]  pay as taxpayers because the people did it they take it loan it out 10 times loan it out 10 times
[3:24:20.840 --> 3:24:25.240]  again 100 out 10 times for every dollar they loaned they call that an asset they'd loan
[3:24:25.240 --> 3:24:31.320]  $10 out and they loan it out 10 times and then they put us on the hook for it and of course
[3:24:31.320 --> 3:24:36.840]  gold surges oil goes up today while they artificially try to suppress it but you look at the short
[3:24:36.840 --> 3:24:44.600]  term the long term the dollar is a dead duck inflation is conservatively at about 15% a year
[3:24:44.600 --> 3:24:49.960]  compounded and it's only going to get worse so a year two years three years down the road
[3:24:50.840 --> 3:24:55.400]  total collapse of the society that's what all of these top economists have said here on this program
[3:24:55.400 --> 3:25:03.480]  now is there any way to avert that and turn that around yes but that's also a very rocky road
[3:25:03.480 --> 3:25:10.600]  instead they're just going with total control and so the private shareholders the Federal Reserve
[3:25:10.600 --> 3:25:15.080]  you notice Chase Manhattan City Bank and others they're the ones basically controlling the private
[3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:21.880]  Federal Reserve through the Treasury and they're just announcing all their all their investments
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:27.000]  are guaranteed all their leveraging is guaranteed and so they're now gobbling up the medium size and
[3:25:27.720 --> 3:25:33.000]  smaller banks and brokerage houses and and and they are becoming the government and then now
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:38.520]  you hear the global banking structure say there's a new Ponzi scheme that's the fractional reserve
[3:25:38.520 --> 3:25:47.000]  system with carbon credits and people all over Austin have you know different carbon credit
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:53.960]  website stickers things like Terra pass and you go you pay them to drive your car and then you
[3:25:53.960 --> 3:25:59.880]  stick a sticker feeling good or and then they're going to make it the law and you and it says you
[3:25:59.880 --> 3:26:07.880]  will pay to the central banks oh central bank so I can drive my suburban I will pay you some
[3:26:07.880 --> 3:26:13.880]  carbon tax see so that's what the new order is it's the private banks becoming the government
[3:26:13.880 --> 3:26:19.720]  and they need to bankrupt every nation so they can fully implode that government in that culture
[3:26:19.720 --> 3:26:25.160]  so that you're fully in debt to them and they've got to have a police state militarized apparatus
[3:26:25.160 --> 3:26:31.560]  to go in and forcibly extract the wealth and the labor and the military conscripts for the empire
[3:26:33.400 --> 3:26:37.960]  and as the British Ministry of Defense says in their 10-year prospectus published in 2007
[3:26:38.600 --> 3:26:42.440]  the public will revolt in Europe the United States Australia Russia China
[3:26:42.440 --> 3:26:48.360]  but the Pentagon designed surveillance face scanning camera scanning car scanning plate
[3:26:48.360 --> 3:26:53.400]  scanning stuff will track you national ID cards world standardized will track everywhere you go
[3:26:53.400 --> 3:27:00.840]  turn that card off you can't buy or sell if the public is to rally mass resistance against a capital
[3:27:00.840 --> 3:27:07.160]  city like London or DC neutron bombs will be dropped on the people if a congress was to try
[3:27:07.160 --> 3:27:11.640]  to throw the president out who's just a puppet himself and say emergency we're reinstating the
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:19.320]  constitution there's a neutron weapon already in DC that's just they just you're gone people say well
[3:27:21.160 --> 3:27:24.200]  if you don't know what a neutron bomb is it doesn't destroy in the buildings doesn't destroy
[3:27:25.560 --> 3:27:30.920]  any of the subways or infrastructure power plants it kills all life with a giant radiation burst
[3:27:34.600 --> 3:27:37.720]  people then say well Alex you keep talking about this the last few weeks
[3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:41.960]  the last few years are you trying to make us hopeless no i want you to face
[3:27:42.520 --> 3:27:48.680]  why they're so arrogant they're euthanizing us they're implanting us with hiv and the vaccines
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:54.360]  and cancer viruses and mercury and sodium fluoride and killing us and having their way with us
[3:27:54.920 --> 3:28:01.240]  and it's all going so well it's all going so well shipping narcotics and putting our children
[3:28:02.680 --> 3:28:06.360]  in prison if we're caught using their products that are owned by them so they get money on
[3:28:06.360 --> 3:28:11.640]  every end of the equation by buy it being illegal it creates artificial scarcity so they can have
[3:28:11.640 --> 3:28:16.680]  a monopoly they can use the war on drugs to cut out their competition they can then when they catch
[3:28:16.680 --> 3:28:22.440]  you using it tax you put you in their forced labor facilities use the police state and the war on
[3:28:22.440 --> 3:28:27.320]  drugs is an excuse to expand their intelligence arms that can then be shifted over to anti-terror
[3:28:27.320 --> 3:28:34.360]  which is anti-political speech i want you to face the full magnitude of continuity of government but
[3:28:34.360 --> 3:28:40.760]  what if there's a mass awakening and not a frontal assault on a capital or congress tries to take over
[3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:46.120]  or anything like that you know the people trying to take back over peacefully but in a concerted
[3:28:47.720 --> 3:28:54.600]  push that won't work when we get back i'll briefly tell you what will work i have a plan
[3:28:54.600 --> 3:29:03.400]  or as they say another strange laugh man sure i have a plan i can walk we'll be right back stay with us

[3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:13.240]  All they want to do is see us fussing and fighting.
[3:34:13.240 --> 3:34:18.240]  I feel this morning.
[3:34:18.240 --> 3:34:22.240]  They don't want us to unite.
[3:34:22.240 --> 3:34:26.240]  The only thing that can beat the eugenics world government
[3:34:26.240 --> 3:34:29.240]  All they want us to do is
[3:34:29.240 --> 3:34:33.240]  The only thing that can defeat
[3:34:33.240 --> 3:34:40.240]  The continuity of government control grid.
[3:34:40.240 --> 3:34:44.240]  All they want us to do is
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:50.240]  Killin' one another top racket.
[3:34:50.240 --> 3:34:52.240]  Did you mean what you said?
[3:34:52.240 --> 3:34:53.240]  Top racket.
[3:34:53.240 --> 3:34:55.240]  Are you scared?
[3:34:55.240 --> 3:34:56.240]  Okay.
[3:34:56.240 --> 3:34:58.240]  Are you scared?
[3:34:58.240 --> 3:35:00.240]  Top racket.
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:02.240]  Top racket.
[3:35:02.240 --> 3:35:04.240]  Probably better if I just simply
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:06.240]  Did you mean what you said?
[3:35:06.240 --> 3:35:07.240]  Top racket.
[3:35:07.240 --> 3:35:12.240]  And encapsulate the whole program very simply put.
[3:35:12.240 --> 3:35:18.240]  You have a British Empire 150 years ago
[3:35:18.240 --> 3:35:21.240]  That from its perspective was getting more and more resistance
[3:35:21.240 --> 3:35:29.240]  As this empire expanded in Asia, in Latin America, in Africa.
[3:35:29.240 --> 3:35:31.240]  And they went to their scientists and said
[3:35:31.240 --> 3:35:34.240]  How do we control populations non-militarily?
[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:36.240]  And so they developed a modern system.
[3:35:36.240 --> 3:35:39.240]  We have a propaganda of fronts, round table groups,
[3:35:39.240 --> 3:35:41.240]  Regional viceroy management groups.
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:43.240]  The power behind the throne.
[3:35:43.240 --> 3:35:45.240]  The invisible empire type model.
[3:35:45.240 --> 3:35:46.240]  Divide and conquer.
[3:35:46.240 --> 3:35:48.240]  Playing different regions off against each other.
[3:35:48.240 --> 3:35:50.240]  Selling weapons to both sides.
[3:35:50.240 --> 3:35:52.240]  Financing both sides.
[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:54.240]  Financing revolutions.
[3:35:54.240 --> 3:35:56.240]  Financing counter revolutions.
[3:35:56.240 --> 3:35:57.240]  That's why they're in control.
[3:35:57.240 --> 3:35:58.240]  They're experts.
[3:35:58.240 --> 3:35:59.240]  They have the funding.
[3:35:59.240 --> 3:36:03.240]  They have the power.
[3:36:03.240 --> 3:36:05.240]  It just so happened they were also into eugenics
[3:36:05.240 --> 3:36:08.240]  In survival of the fittest social Darwinism.
[3:36:08.240 --> 3:36:10.240]  So they've always been into reducing
[3:36:10.240 --> 3:36:12.240]  The population's numbers.
[3:36:12.240 --> 3:36:14.240]  Into culling the herd.
[3:36:14.240 --> 3:36:18.240]  They also want life extension technologies for themselves.
[3:36:18.240 --> 3:36:22.240]  They claim it for the environment.
[3:36:22.240 --> 3:36:26.240]  But then they do all these horrible things to the environment.
[3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:28.240]  They're clearly the authors of that.
[3:36:28.240 --> 3:36:30.240]  They'll give nuclear weapons to Pakistan
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:33.240]  Just to escalate the tension in the region
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:35.240]  So they can come in and be the saviour.
[3:36:35.240 --> 3:36:40.240]  They'll allow cross species chimera.
[3:36:40.240 --> 3:36:41.240]  Human pig clones.
[3:36:41.240 --> 3:36:42.240]  Human cow clones.
[3:36:42.240 --> 3:36:44.240]  Human chimpanzee clones for body parts.
[3:36:44.240 --> 3:36:47.240]  They'll let super viruses, super bacteria get out.
[3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:51.240]  And then they'll already have a drug to treat it.
[3:36:51.240 --> 3:36:54.240]  They'll cover it up with different new syndromes
[3:36:54.240 --> 3:36:55.240]  They're announcing.
[3:36:55.240 --> 3:36:57.240]  I mean they're masters at problem reaction solution.
[3:36:57.240 --> 3:36:59.240]  But they're also quite mad.
[3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:03.240]  Quite insane.
[3:37:03.240 --> 3:37:06.240]  And they've said that they're going to repossess the land,
[3:37:06.240 --> 3:37:08.240]  the property, the middle class of Europe, England,
[3:37:08.240 --> 3:37:10.240]  the US, Australia, New Zealand.
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:12.240]  And they've said that they're going to implement
[3:37:12.240 --> 3:37:15.240]  more soft kill programs like they've done in Africa
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:17.240]  and Latin America and Asia.
[3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:19.240]  With HIV, with the population of the US
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:24.240]  and other similar autoimmune cancer viruses
[3:37:24.240 --> 3:37:25.240]  that have been manipulated.
[3:37:25.240 --> 3:37:26.240]  That's all declassified.
[3:37:26.240 --> 3:37:28.240]  They created AIDS in the 70s.
[3:37:28.240 --> 3:37:29.240]  We've had medical doctors on.
[3:37:29.240 --> 3:37:31.240]  The documents are all public.
[3:37:31.240 --> 3:37:33.240]  And they're going to accelerate that.
[3:37:33.240 --> 3:37:35.240]  Each program getting worse than the last
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:37.240]  as they pose as the savior with the medical treatment
[3:37:37.240 --> 3:37:40.240]  dealing with the problem.
[3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:43.240]  They're going to continue increasing the fluoride in the water,
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:46.240]  the poisons in the water, the poisons in the food,
[3:37:46.240 --> 3:37:49.240]  the vaccines, the mercury, the spring,
[3:37:49.240 --> 3:37:51.240]  the chemtrails which they now admit they're doing,
[3:37:51.240 --> 3:37:55.240]  mainstream news.
[3:37:55.240 --> 3:37:59.240]  And if we were to try to say March on Washington,
[3:37:59.240 --> 3:38:01.240]  take it over even, let's say, 100 members of Congress
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:02.240]  were with us.
[3:38:02.240 --> 3:38:03.240]  Hey, the government's illegitimate.
[3:38:03.240 --> 3:38:05.240]  You stole trillions from the Pentagon.
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:09.240]  You bankrupted the economy by design and fraud.
[3:38:09.240 --> 3:38:11.240]  We're going to arrest the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:12.240]  of Staff.
[3:38:12.240 --> 3:38:13.240]  We're going to arrest David Rockefeller
[3:38:13.240 --> 3:38:14.240]  and the leaders of the CFR.
[3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:16.240]  We've got your own public admissions.
[3:38:16.240 --> 3:38:17.240]  You wanted to overthrow the country,
[3:38:17.240 --> 3:38:22.240]  North American Union, outside of congressional review.
[3:38:22.240 --> 3:38:25.240]  They have said, and this is publicly published,
[3:38:25.240 --> 3:38:27.240]  they've said if we try to rebel and take over
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:32.240]  Washington or London, neutron bomb will be used on us.
[3:38:32.240 --> 3:38:33.240]  Now that's the last resort.
[3:38:33.240 --> 3:38:35.240]  They've declassified in 2000.
[3:38:35.240 --> 3:38:37.240]  They've got helicopters in every major city,
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:41.240]  capital city with spray bottles, canisters with
[3:38:41.240 --> 3:38:43.240]  opiate knockout gas.
[3:38:43.240 --> 3:38:45.240]  By the way, that kills a large percentage of those
[3:38:45.240 --> 3:38:48.240]  that are sprayed in car racks, fires, falling down.
[3:38:48.240 --> 3:38:49.240]  It knocks you out instantly.
[3:38:49.240 --> 3:38:52.240]  They also have nerve gas station in every major capital city,
[3:38:52.240 --> 3:38:56.240]  state and federal, and also commercial centers.
[3:38:56.240 --> 3:39:01.240]  Sunshine Project declassified 2000.
[3:39:01.240 --> 3:39:04.240]  That's declassified.
[3:39:04.240 --> 3:39:06.240]  People would go up against this,
[3:39:06.240 --> 3:39:08.240]  would know they'd be wearing protective gear.
[3:39:08.240 --> 3:39:14.240]  Well, they're just going to hit you with a neutron burst.
[3:39:14.240 --> 3:39:16.240]  This is what shadow government's been doing,
[3:39:16.240 --> 3:39:22.240]  is just 800 pound gorilla piling on the power they've got.
[3:39:22.240 --> 3:39:25.240]  What they can't stop is people producing books,
[3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:26.240]  books with this information.
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:28.240]  You go do it, folks.
[3:39:28.240 --> 3:39:30.240]  Films, you know, in-game covers some of it,
[3:39:30.240 --> 3:39:31.240]  but it doesn't cover it all.
[3:39:31.240 --> 3:39:34.240]  I need to make a master film, a quote,
[3:39:34.240 --> 3:39:36.240]  mastermind film that just basically gives you the facts.
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:38.240]  The problem is if you spend your time proving each fact,
[3:39:38.240 --> 3:39:41.240]  then it's 10 hours long, maybe just with footnotes
[3:39:41.240 --> 3:39:44.240]  and a bibliography on the end with a disc with the documents,
[3:39:44.240 --> 3:39:46.240]  and here it is.
[3:39:46.240 --> 3:39:48.240]  I mean, this is like a science fiction movie,
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:49.240]  but this is what they're doing,
[3:39:49.240 --> 3:39:54.240]  and this is what we're faced with.
[3:39:54.240 --> 3:39:58.240]  Total and complete control.
[3:39:58.240 --> 3:39:59.240]  So how do we counter them?
[3:39:59.240 --> 3:40:02.240]  If we buy a city by city, wake people up.
[3:40:02.240 --> 3:40:06.240]  City by city, even have referendums with paper ballots
[3:40:06.240 --> 3:40:08.240]  to remove the electronic voting machine.
[3:40:08.240 --> 3:40:10.240]  See, they're checkmaning us with that,
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:14.240]  and have hundreds of cities that peacefully say,
[3:40:14.240 --> 3:40:16.240]  we know about the shadow government,
[3:40:16.240 --> 3:40:17.240]  we know about the shadow program,
[3:40:17.240 --> 3:40:18.240]  we know about the genetic engineering,
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:22.240]  the bio weapons, the neutron bombs,
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:25.240]  and where it is just a mass awakening
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:28.240]  where everyone talks about it, everybody deals with it,
[3:40:28.240 --> 3:40:30.240]  everybody deals with shadow government
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:33.240]  with full spectrum domination that we're under.
[3:40:33.240 --> 3:40:36.240]  The only way is us saying no,
[3:40:36.240 --> 3:40:38.240]  and we're not going along with this,
[3:40:38.240 --> 3:40:40.240]  and we're aware of your program,
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:43.240]  and then having mass global strikes
[3:40:43.240 --> 3:40:46.240]  against the global New World Order shadow government
[3:40:46.240 --> 3:40:51.240]  that's in place in 90 plus percent of the countries.
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:53.240]  And even if we try to do that,
[3:40:53.240 --> 3:40:55.240]  they'll set off a nuke and say Al Qaeda did it
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:40:56.240]  to set up martial law.
[3:40:56.240 --> 3:41:00.240]  They will release bio weapons,
[3:41:00.240 --> 3:41:03.240]  and say that Al Qaeda did it to take control
[3:41:03.240 --> 3:41:05.240]  and depose his saviors.
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:07.240]  They'll crank up their hurricane machines,
[3:41:07.240 --> 3:41:09.240]  which were declassified four years ago,
[3:41:09.240 --> 3:41:12.240]  and they were controlling hurricane Stanford Research Institute
[3:41:12.240 --> 3:41:15.240]  certified in 1967.
[3:41:15.240 --> 3:41:20.240]  They'll pull unlimited crap.
[3:41:20.240 --> 3:41:23.240]  But if we as a brotherhood of liberty
[3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:24.240]  and freedom and understanding,
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:26.240]  because we let them get the shadow government,
[3:41:26.240 --> 3:41:27.240]  we let them set up counter government,
[3:41:27.240 --> 3:41:30.240]  we let them build this giant parallel system,
[3:41:30.240 --> 3:41:32.240]  this technological spire that's above
[3:41:32.240 --> 3:41:38.240]  our suppressed technological development in society,
[3:41:38.240 --> 3:41:41.240]  all we can do now is have an awakening in the substrata
[3:41:41.240 --> 3:41:44.240]  that 99% of us are in
[3:41:44.240 --> 3:41:46.240]  to the viciousness in the programs
[3:41:46.240 --> 3:41:48.240]  and the tactics of the elites.
[3:41:48.240 --> 3:41:50.240]  So even if they release bio weapons
[3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:52.240]  or stage terror attacks or economic collapse,
[3:41:52.240 --> 3:41:54.240]  people know from their own documents,
[3:41:54.240 --> 3:41:56.240]  because they have to communicate this to their minions.
[3:41:56.240 --> 3:41:57.240]  It's all public.
[3:41:57.240 --> 3:41:58.240]  What they're doing.
[3:41:58.240 --> 3:42:00.240]  See, they had such contempt for us,
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:04.240]  their blueprints are all public.
[3:42:04.240 --> 3:42:07.240]  So that's one of their weaknesses.
[3:42:07.240 --> 3:42:09.240]  And so we have to have this mass awakening.
[3:42:09.240 --> 3:42:17.240]  We also have to speak to members of the elite.
[3:42:17.240 --> 3:42:21.240]  We have to speak to members of the establishment
[3:42:21.240 --> 3:42:23.240]  and their high level gophers, their servants,
[3:42:23.240 --> 3:42:25.240]  their minions, their administrators,
[3:42:25.240 --> 3:42:27.240]  their children, their wives, their husbands
[3:42:27.240 --> 3:42:30.240]  to leak info to help us to rebel against this,
[3:42:30.240 --> 3:42:32.240]  to not be part of this,
[3:42:32.240 --> 3:42:34.240]  because this is the ultimate dictatorship,
[3:42:34.240 --> 3:42:35.240]  the ultimate dehumanization,
[3:42:35.240 --> 3:42:38.240]  and there's no doubt it's against the species
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:40.240]  and against goodness.
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:43.240]  And it's so predatory it seeks to dumb down
[3:42:43.240 --> 3:42:44.240]  and exterminate the mass.
[3:42:44.240 --> 3:42:48.240]  I mean, that's just unacceptable.
[3:42:48.240 --> 3:42:50.240]  And so we have to first expose government-sponsored terror,
[3:42:50.240 --> 3:42:51.240]  problem-reaction solution,
[3:42:51.240 --> 3:42:56.240]  economic, chemical, biological, radiological.
[3:42:56.240 --> 3:42:58.240]  We have to take control of the cities, counties.
[3:42:58.240 --> 3:43:00.240]  We have to take control of the media.
[3:43:00.240 --> 3:43:01.240]  We have to act.
[3:43:01.240 --> 3:43:03.240]  Those of you listening as agents,
[3:43:03.240 --> 3:43:04.240]  and you have to decide,
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:05.240]  are you going to be a secret agent
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:07.240]  who communicates with no one,
[3:43:07.240 --> 3:43:10.240]  but engages in sabotage in the New World Order
[3:43:10.240 --> 3:43:12.240]  in a peaceful way, I mean, in an info war
[3:43:12.240 --> 3:43:17.240]  at your level?
[3:43:17.240 --> 3:43:19.240]  Are you going to be someone who's outspoken?
[3:43:19.240 --> 3:43:25.240]  Are you going to be someone that covertly does
[3:43:25.240 --> 3:43:28.240]  banner hangs once a week about the surveillance cameras
[3:43:28.240 --> 3:43:31.240]  even better than climbing up and bashing them to pieces?
[3:43:31.240 --> 3:43:34.240]  Are you going to be someone that writes with chalk,
[3:43:34.240 --> 3:43:35.240]  which isn't even vandalism,
[3:43:35.240 --> 3:43:37.240]  a washable chalk that's up for three or four days
[3:43:37.240 --> 3:43:40.240]  or a week on the city streets every night in your area
[3:43:40.240 --> 3:43:42.240]  until just the chalk about the New World Order
[3:43:42.240 --> 3:43:43.240]  and the shadow government
[3:43:43.240 --> 3:43:45.240]  and the false reality is everywhere?
[3:43:45.240 --> 3:43:48.240]  I mean, this is a true rebellion against the matrix.
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:54.240]  And you see, the matrix is a thing to come.
[3:43:54.240 --> 3:43:56.240]  The Wachowski brothers have been let in
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:43:58.240]  on something that was declassified
[3:43:58.240 --> 3:44:01.240]  in January 7th, 2000,
[3:44:01.240 --> 3:44:04.240]  by the Federation of American Scientists.
[3:44:04.240 --> 3:44:06.240]  The Army became very mad and said,
[3:44:06.240 --> 3:44:08.240]  are some of our top scientists or members?
[3:44:08.240 --> 3:44:11.240]  We are no longer going to let our top scientists
[3:44:11.240 --> 3:44:12.240]  be members with you guys.
[3:44:12.240 --> 3:44:14.240]  If you continue to leak this stuff,
[3:44:14.240 --> 3:44:17.240]  this was not for declassification.
[3:44:17.240 --> 3:44:20.240]  And it said, and then this was declassified again
[3:44:20.240 --> 3:44:24.240]  from the 80s, that it is going to be a matrix hive
[3:44:24.240 --> 3:44:30.240]  and we are going to be inserted by 2025 into our canisters.
[3:44:30.240 --> 3:44:32.240]  So you see, when you see that movie, The Matrix,
[3:44:32.240 --> 3:44:35.240]  that's what they're planning to do.
[3:44:35.240 --> 3:44:37.240]  And they say it's going to be wonderful.
[3:44:37.240 --> 3:44:39.240]  We're going to live a lot longer.
[3:44:39.240 --> 3:44:41.240]  We're not going to have pain.
[3:44:41.240 --> 3:44:43.240]  Now, of course, really, they're just going to be killing people.
[3:44:43.240 --> 3:44:45.240]  You're not going in in canisters, folks.
[3:44:45.240 --> 3:44:47.240]  But that's what they've told the technocrats.
[3:44:47.240 --> 3:44:49.240]  That's what Mr. Marshall, you know,
[3:44:49.240 --> 3:44:51.240]  the head futurist of the Pentagon has said.
[3:44:51.240 --> 3:44:53.240]  And I know this sounds crazy, folks,
[3:44:53.240 --> 3:44:55.240]  but they say we're all going to be inserted
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:45:02.240]  into our tanks by 2025.
[3:45:02.240 --> 3:45:06.240]  I don't know about you, but I'm not going in any tank.
[3:45:06.240 --> 3:45:13.240]  The sensory deprivation tank with the wires into your brain.
[3:45:13.240 --> 3:45:18.240]  As I said, that's the only way to make virtual reality completely real.
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:20.240]  But this is them playing God.
[3:45:20.240 --> 3:45:27.240]  And then the elites will, they say,
[3:45:27.240 --> 3:45:29.240]  leave copies of themselves here on Earth
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:33.240]  and send copies of themselves into space navigation
[3:45:33.240 --> 3:45:36.240]  to hibernate to the next galaxy or the next star
[3:45:36.240 --> 3:45:37.240]  and do whatever they want.
[3:45:37.240 --> 3:45:39.240]  And I'm not saying any of this is real.
[3:45:39.240 --> 3:45:41.240]  I'm not saying this is going to happen.
[3:45:41.240 --> 3:45:44.240]  I'm telling you, folks, they said in this 1980s report,
[3:45:44.240 --> 3:45:47.240]  declassified in 2000, how they'd use the media
[3:45:47.240 --> 3:45:50.240]  to sell everybody first with an implantable chip for security.
[3:45:50.240 --> 3:45:53.240]  Old people, they said we'll use it for fads.
[3:45:53.240 --> 3:45:55.240]  You know, we'll have Hollywood push it.
[3:45:55.240 --> 3:45:56.240]  And what did they do?
[3:45:56.240 --> 3:45:59.240]  And then like clockwork, when they said they'd announced it,
[3:45:59.240 --> 3:46:01.240]  they announced it, started pushing it.
[3:46:01.240 --> 3:46:07.240]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[3:46:07.240 --> 3:46:09.240]  Now, I don't know if they'll be able to do that
[3:46:09.240 --> 3:46:10.240]  or get away with that.
[3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:12.240]  But the point is, you've got parallel governments.
[3:46:12.240 --> 3:46:14.240]  You've got our legitimate government,
[3:46:14.240 --> 3:46:16.240]  our system, our Bill of Rights, our Constitution.
[3:46:16.240 --> 3:46:19.240]  And next to it, they were building this tyranny.
[3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:22.240]  And it is now absorbing the original rail.
[3:46:22.240 --> 3:46:24.240]  It is now overtaking.
[3:46:24.240 --> 3:46:27.240]  The new order is being born.
[3:46:27.240 --> 3:46:31.240]  And what it means is a psychopathic genius killer
[3:46:31.240 --> 3:46:33.240]  is running, raping, killing, genetic splicing,
[3:46:33.240 --> 3:46:37.240]  just mad scientist, crazy land.
[3:46:37.240 --> 3:46:40.240]  And so the only way to stop them is to educate the public
[3:46:40.240 --> 3:46:42.240]  about their true program no matter how horrific it is.
[3:46:42.240 --> 3:46:43.240]  I mean, it is 2008.
[3:46:43.240 --> 3:46:45.240]  The elite doesn't want us to have the full knowledge
[3:46:45.240 --> 3:46:46.240]  of what they're doing.
[3:46:46.240 --> 3:46:50.240]  They have built, under the continuity of government,
[3:46:50.240 --> 3:46:54.240]  where tens of trillions of dollars of investment is secret,
[3:46:54.240 --> 3:46:56.240]  but now they're letting us know what it is
[3:46:56.240 --> 3:46:59.240]  that the national security state is now absorbing
[3:46:59.240 --> 3:47:01.240]  the local school, local fire department,
[3:47:01.240 --> 3:47:03.240]  the local county, the private corporations
[3:47:03.240 --> 3:47:06.240]  that created unlimited false liquidity in our name
[3:47:06.240 --> 3:47:08.240]  that we've got to pay for, bought everything
[3:47:08.240 --> 3:47:09.240]  and are leaving us the debt.
[3:47:09.240 --> 3:47:12.240]  I mean, it's full spectrum.
[3:47:12.240 --> 3:47:15.240]  They're cancelling out the voting with their machines,
[3:47:15.240 --> 3:47:16.240]  caught thousands of times red-handed.
[3:47:16.240 --> 3:47:19.240]  They're cancelling out the local police federalizing them.
[3:47:19.240 --> 3:47:21.240]  They're federalizing the entire system.
[3:47:21.240 --> 3:47:26.240]  They are bringing in full spectrum dominance.
[3:47:26.240 --> 3:47:29.240]  And they're turning the schools into mental institutions
[3:47:29.240 --> 3:47:31.240]  where everybody goes and sees a shrink
[3:47:31.240 --> 3:47:33.240]  and everybody's depressed and everybody goes on drugs.
[3:47:33.240 --> 3:47:35.240]  I mean, it's all right here.
[3:47:35.240 --> 3:47:38.240]  They are just taking over the farms and ranches
[3:47:38.240 --> 3:47:41.240]  with new regulators, millions of new bureaucrats,
[3:47:41.240 --> 3:47:43.240]  global carbon taxes.
[3:47:43.240 --> 3:47:44.240]  You can't have too much beef.
[3:47:44.240 --> 3:47:45.240]  We've got to track what you eat.
[3:47:45.240 --> 3:47:47.240]  It's hurting the earth.
[3:47:47.240 --> 3:47:48.240]  Humans are bad.
[3:47:48.240 --> 3:47:49.240]  You exhale poison.
[3:47:49.240 --> 3:47:51.240]  We've got to regulate that.
[3:47:51.240 --> 3:47:53.240]  And then Richard N. Haas says we're evil
[3:47:53.240 --> 3:47:55.240]  and says we've got to be exterminated.
[3:47:55.240 --> 3:47:57.240]  Henry Kissinger says it.
[3:47:57.240 --> 3:47:58.240]  And then you confront them in Denver.
[3:47:58.240 --> 3:48:00.240]  That video's up on infowars.com
[3:48:00.240 --> 3:48:05.240]  and they just say, I never said that.
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:07.240]  And, you know, the elite would say,
[3:48:07.240 --> 3:48:08.240]  because they write this and say this,
[3:48:08.240 --> 3:48:11.240]  oh, well, so you just can't grasp it.
[3:48:11.240 --> 3:48:12.240]  You can see what we're doing,
[3:48:12.240 --> 3:48:16.240]  but you don't understand the necessity of it.
[3:48:16.240 --> 3:48:18.240]  The necessity of handing out nuclear weapons
[3:48:18.240 --> 3:48:20.240]  and then claiming you want world government to stop it.
[3:48:20.240 --> 3:48:23.240]  The necessity of cross-splicing every species imaginable
[3:48:23.240 --> 3:48:26.240]  and open air releasing it while all sorts of biospheres
[3:48:26.240 --> 3:48:28.240]  break down and die.
[3:48:28.240 --> 3:48:30.240]  And they go, yes, we're forcing the crisis.
[3:48:30.240 --> 3:48:32.240]  So you will understand you're bad and have to die.
[3:48:32.240 --> 3:48:35.240]  I mean, they are literally self-destructive.
[3:48:35.240 --> 3:48:37.240]  Just like Nero,
[3:48:37.240 --> 3:48:41.240]  Barned Rome went crazy, murdered people every day, drank blood,
[3:48:41.240 --> 3:48:44.240]  you know, Caligula marrying his horse, similar things,
[3:48:44.240 --> 3:48:46.240]  and finally just went and committed suicide.
[3:48:46.240 --> 3:48:49.240]  They're suicidal nihilists and they say they're suicidal nihilists.
[3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:51.240]  They say, look, we've got all the power and control
[3:48:51.240 --> 3:48:54.240]  and we just want to kill everybody.
[3:48:54.240 --> 3:48:55.240]  And what did Stalin do?
[3:48:55.240 --> 3:48:56.240]  What did Hitler do?
[3:48:56.240 --> 3:48:58.240]  What did they all do?
[3:48:58.240 --> 3:49:01.240]  So we have to take over this plane of existence.
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:03.240]  We have to recognize the spires.
[3:49:03.240 --> 3:49:06.240]  We have to recognize, and as police officers and military,
[3:49:06.240 --> 3:49:08.240]  number one, stop believing what I'm saying.
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:09.240]  Stop believing what the government's saying.
[3:49:09.240 --> 3:49:11.240]  Go find out, I've told you the truth.
[3:49:11.240 --> 3:49:13.240]  Find out, you and your whole plant family
[3:49:13.240 --> 3:49:14.240]  have been implanted with cancer viruses.
[3:49:14.240 --> 3:49:18.240]  Soft kill, hormone-released systems.
[3:49:18.240 --> 3:49:19.240]  Find out you're with us.
[3:49:19.240 --> 3:49:20.240]  Find out you're being killed.
[3:49:20.240 --> 3:49:22.240]  Find out you're under attack.
[3:49:22.240 --> 3:49:24.240]  Find out you're slated for extinction.
[3:49:24.240 --> 3:49:26.240]  I mean, you don't want your progeny to have life extension.
[3:49:26.240 --> 3:49:28.240]  You don't want to be able to go to space.
[3:49:28.240 --> 3:49:29.240]  You don't know they've suppressed.
[3:49:29.240 --> 3:49:31.240]  God knows where they're at, folks.
[3:49:31.240 --> 3:49:34.240]  All we know is it's secret and what they admit's a total nightmare.
[3:49:34.240 --> 3:49:37.240]  Force will be putting brain chips on us in the next 10 years
[3:49:37.240 --> 3:49:41.240]  and then sticking us in tanks.
[3:49:41.240 --> 3:49:43.240]  And see how that works is, well, everybody's got a chip
[3:49:43.240 --> 3:49:44.240]  that works at this office.
[3:49:44.240 --> 3:49:46.240]  Well, if you want to have the cop job,
[3:49:46.240 --> 3:49:47.240]  you got to have the brain chip.
[3:49:47.240 --> 3:49:51.240]  You want to fly an F-20 QX-9 or whatever it's going to be called.
[3:49:51.240 --> 3:49:52.240]  You got to have this.
[3:49:52.240 --> 3:49:53.240]  Oh, you want to be robotic.
[3:49:53.240 --> 3:49:55.240]  Well, you want to have a job here.
[3:49:55.240 --> 3:49:56.240]  Oh, you're like an Amish person.
[3:49:56.240 --> 3:49:57.240]  You don't want this.
[3:49:57.240 --> 3:50:00.240]  See, the Army talks about, I mean, that's what they...
[3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:04.240]  See, to the military, total dominance and peace
[3:50:04.240 --> 3:50:07.240]  is everyone in a cocoon tank.
[3:50:07.240 --> 3:50:08.240]  No more war, no more threat.
[3:50:08.240 --> 3:50:10.240]  That is peace.
[3:50:10.240 --> 3:50:13.240]  And then the elite are up above is the technicians.
[3:50:13.240 --> 3:50:15.240]  The ultimate control freak system.
[3:50:15.240 --> 3:50:18.240]  Can you imagine that?
[3:50:18.240 --> 3:50:19.240]  We'll be back with a...
[3:50:19.240 --> 3:50:20.240]  Well, I'm going to skip this segment.
[3:50:20.240 --> 3:50:21.240]  I'm going to skip.
[3:50:21.240 --> 3:50:22.240]  Since the year 2000.
[3:50:22.240 --> 3:50:23.240]  I'm going to skip and take some calls.
[3:50:23.240 --> 3:50:26.240]  I'm going to come back and finish basically the master plan for everybody.
[3:50:26.240 --> 3:50:29.240]  Again, but I mean, is it clear for viewers out there?
[3:50:29.240 --> 3:50:31.240]  You just take control of the system.
[3:50:31.240 --> 3:50:32.240]  You say no.
[3:50:32.240 --> 3:50:35.240]  You recognize the full matrix horror of it.
[3:50:35.240 --> 3:50:37.240]  The matrix isn't here yet.
[3:50:37.240 --> 3:50:42.240]  This is the insertion into the matrix.
[3:50:42.240 --> 3:50:44.240]  This is how you are to be inserted.
[3:50:44.240 --> 3:50:47.240]  And now you've been given the mythos to prepare yourself.
[3:50:47.240 --> 3:50:50.240]  And how does Neo defeat the matrix?
[3:50:50.240 --> 3:50:52.240]  He jacks into the matrix.
[3:50:52.240 --> 3:50:55.240]  See, you've been told that lie.
[3:50:55.240 --> 3:50:56.240]  You understand?
[3:50:56.240 --> 3:50:57.240]  So you're being prepared.
[3:50:57.240 --> 3:51:02.240]  You're being mass imprinted to jack in as a wire head, a cyberpunk.
[3:51:02.240 --> 3:51:03.240]  That's being set up.
[3:51:03.240 --> 3:51:06.240]  You know, you want to work at the Attorney General of Mexico's office.
[3:51:06.240 --> 3:51:07.240]  You've got to take a chip.
[3:51:07.240 --> 3:51:08.240]  Oh, you want to be a police officer?
[3:51:08.240 --> 3:51:09.240]  You've got to take a chip.
[3:51:09.240 --> 3:51:10.240]  You want to work at this company?
[3:51:10.240 --> 3:51:11.240]  You've got to take a chip.
[3:51:11.240 --> 3:51:12.240]  Oh, well, the cool people have got this new chip.
[3:51:12.240 --> 3:51:13.240]  And look at all it does.
[3:51:13.240 --> 3:51:16.240]  It gives you unlimited pleasure.
[3:51:16.240 --> 3:51:19.240]  And see, and now, oh, if free will, oh, pure pleasure.
[3:51:19.240 --> 3:51:20.240]  Do you want to be in the tank?
[3:51:20.240 --> 3:51:25.240]  Do you want that pure pleasure to continue?
[3:51:25.240 --> 3:51:27.240]  Come with us.
[3:51:27.240 --> 3:51:29.240]  And then you're so out of your mind, it doesn't even matter.
[3:51:29.240 --> 3:51:31.240]  DARPA admits they've put up towers.
[3:51:31.240 --> 3:51:34.240]  This was in the Baltimore Sun like six years ago.
[3:51:34.240 --> 3:51:37.240]  To quote, mind control is to make us feel good.
[3:51:37.240 --> 3:51:39.240]  And they admit they're already testing this.
[3:51:39.240 --> 3:51:42.240]  Now, of course, that makes schizophrenics come out of the woodwork.
[3:51:42.240 --> 3:51:44.240]  And schizophrenics have always thought that was happening.
[3:51:44.240 --> 3:51:47.240]  Most of them are just schizophrenics, but some of them aren't.
[3:51:47.240 --> 3:51:50.240]  And it's in the major newspaper that they're doing it.
[3:51:50.240 --> 3:51:53.240]  So see how that works, see how that operates.
[3:51:53.240 --> 3:51:56.240]  This is the level of craziness that we're dealing with.
[3:51:56.240 --> 3:52:00.240]  And because it is a shadow government with unlimited funding and underground bases everywhere,
[3:52:00.240 --> 3:52:01.240]  God knows what they're doing.
[3:52:01.240 --> 3:52:03.240]  They admit they've created clones.
[3:52:03.240 --> 3:52:05.240]  They admit they've created super bio weapons.
[3:52:05.240 --> 3:52:08.240]  They admit they've got mind control towers up.
[3:52:08.240 --> 3:52:10.240]  They admit they want to put chips in all of us.
[3:52:10.240 --> 3:52:13.240]  They admit they want to put us in matrix tanks.
[3:52:13.240 --> 3:52:19.240]  They admit they want to use neutron bombs on us if we rebel.
[3:52:19.240 --> 3:52:21.240]  You see, they're in the real world.
[3:52:21.240 --> 3:52:25.240]  You're thinking about Hollywood stars and how to act cool and all of this crap.
[3:52:25.240 --> 3:52:27.240]  Meanwhile, that's going on.
[3:52:27.240 --> 3:52:30.240]  All right, who's up next here with the loaded phones?
[3:52:30.240 --> 3:52:31.240]  Duke and Jersey.
[3:52:31.240 --> 3:52:34.240]  Duke and Jersey, thanks for holding.
[3:52:34.240 --> 3:52:35.240]  Hey, how are you doing?
[3:52:35.240 --> 3:52:36.240]  Good.
[3:52:36.240 --> 3:52:37.240]  Hello.
[3:52:37.240 --> 3:52:39.240]  Yes, sir.
[3:52:39.240 --> 3:52:41.240]  And how are you doing today?
[3:52:41.240 --> 3:52:42.240]  Good.
[3:52:42.240 --> 3:52:43.240]  I appreciate everything you do, man.
[3:52:43.240 --> 3:52:49.240]  Honestly, down here in South Jersey, there's few and far that I believe the thing you believe.
[3:52:49.240 --> 3:52:50.240]  Definitely one of them.
[3:52:50.240 --> 3:52:53.240]  And you are like an idol to me.
[3:52:53.240 --> 3:52:54.240]  I do want you to know that.
[3:52:54.240 --> 3:52:57.240]  And people do appreciate you doing what you do every day.
[3:52:57.240 --> 3:53:01.240]  Well, I appreciate the appreciation, but you can do far better than I've done.
[3:53:01.240 --> 3:53:04.240]  And that's what I do want to call you talk about.
[3:53:04.240 --> 3:53:09.240]  It's because September 11th, the seven-year anniversary is coming up on Thursday.
[3:53:09.240 --> 3:53:16.240]  I know my local county here, or Paris, as you might call it, is holding a memorial.
[3:53:16.240 --> 3:53:20.240]  What they're holding is a government worship where we worship those that were killed,
[3:53:20.240 --> 3:53:24.240]  and then the agenda of a police-stated evil is the new patriotism.
[3:53:24.240 --> 3:53:26.240]  So it's an evil function.
[3:53:26.240 --> 3:53:30.240]  It's an evil function where the evil of the government is put next to a poor widow who
[3:53:30.240 --> 3:53:34.240]  he knows good, and then off her reflected light and wholesomeness were sold on evil.
[3:53:34.240 --> 3:53:35.240]  We're coming back.
[3:53:35.240 --> 3:53:37.240]  Here we go.
[3:53:37.240 --> 3:53:44.240]  Okay, we're talking to Duke in Jersey, so it's a 9-11 memorial where the government poses
[3:53:44.240 --> 3:53:46.240]  as our saviors is coming up.
[3:53:46.240 --> 3:53:47.240]  Go ahead and finish up.
[3:53:47.240 --> 3:53:51.240]  Yeah, and I do want you to know me and a handful of my close friends are going to be participating
[3:53:51.240 --> 3:53:55.240]  in that, demonstrating, you know, paying our respects to the people that did lose somebody,
[3:53:55.240 --> 3:53:57.240]  because, you know, you don't want to be disrespectful to them.
[3:53:57.240 --> 3:53:58.240]  Good.
[3:53:58.240 --> 3:53:59.240]  You know, that's my main message.
[3:53:59.240 --> 3:54:02.240]  Don't be disrespectful to the families that lost, but at the same time, we are going to
[3:54:02.240 --> 3:54:07.240]  demonstrate for a new investigation, because, like you said so many times, you know, there
[3:54:07.240 --> 3:54:08.240]  has been nobody indicted.
[3:54:08.240 --> 3:54:09.240]  And why?
[3:54:09.240 --> 3:54:12.240]  Because there's no evidence against the people that are claiming.
[3:54:12.240 --> 3:54:13.240]  That's right.
[3:54:13.240 --> 3:54:14.240]  No one died there.
[3:54:14.240 --> 3:54:15.240]  What's going on?
[3:54:15.240 --> 3:54:16.240]  We're not going to, you know, we're not going to go ahead and talk about conspiracy theories,
[3:54:16.240 --> 3:54:21.240]  because, I mean, here I got kicked off the local message board because, you know, exercising
[3:54:21.240 --> 3:54:22.240]  my first memory.
[3:54:22.240 --> 3:54:25.240]  Yeah, you got the thought, the thought, the thought around on there.
[3:54:25.240 --> 3:54:30.240]  It's hard, it's hard to get your, get your voice around here, but I mean, me and about
[3:54:30.240 --> 3:54:35.240]  10, 15 people are going to be demonstrating, you know, and get a new investigation, you
[3:54:35.240 --> 3:54:37.240]  know, the media, the local media cannot ignore that.
[3:54:37.240 --> 3:54:38.240]  We're there.
[3:54:38.240 --> 3:54:39.240]  So, I mean, that's the way.
[3:54:39.240 --> 3:54:40.240]  I hear you.
[3:54:40.240 --> 3:54:41.240]  Good job.
[3:54:41.240 --> 3:54:42.240]  Good job.
[3:54:42.240 --> 3:54:44.240]  How do folks contact you if they want to demonstrate with you there in New Jersey?
[3:54:44.240 --> 3:54:47.240]  They can reach me directly on my personal line.
[3:54:47.240 --> 3:54:48.240]  It's 856-803-3518.
[3:54:48.240 --> 3:54:58.240]  Okay, I got to jump, I got to jump, and I should have gotten to Issa, Bob, Roy, Mark, Dave,
[3:54:58.240 --> 3:55:00.240]  David, so many.
[3:55:00.240 --> 3:55:02.240]  I'll try to jam in one or two more here at the end.
[3:55:02.240 --> 3:55:06.240]  I won't even plug fabled enemies, even though that's a big part of the solution or truth
[3:55:06.240 --> 3:55:07.240]  rising.
[3:55:07.240 --> 3:55:10.240]  But basically, we have to have a public debate.
[3:55:10.240 --> 3:55:14.240]  As long as we're denying what the shadow government is doing, this is the key.
[3:55:14.240 --> 3:55:17.240]  As long as we stay in denial, there's no North American Union.
[3:55:17.240 --> 3:55:19.240]  Russia attacked Georgia first.
[3:55:19.240 --> 3:55:21.240]  See, they're training us to accept lies.
[3:55:21.240 --> 3:55:25.740]  They mean for us to know those are lies, killing the al-Qaeda chief, you know, 15 times, never
[3:55:25.740 --> 3:55:27.960]  retracting the last time they killed him.
[3:55:27.960 --> 3:55:29.800]  They're training you to accept lies.
[3:55:29.800 --> 3:55:34.800]  They're training you to just turn loose, not focus on what shadow government's doing.
[3:55:34.800 --> 3:55:38.240]  We have to first have an education process that there is a shadow government, there
[3:55:38.240 --> 3:55:42.240]  is an underground government, it is involved in managing our society, it is absorbing
[3:55:42.240 --> 3:55:46.560]  the rest of our governments, the rest of our society, it is criminal, it is very blood
[3:55:46.560 --> 3:55:51.400]  thirsty, it is very sadistic, it is very controlling, it is very wicked.
[3:55:51.400 --> 3:55:54.840]  Then we have to educate the public about what this shadow government admits its policies
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:55:55.840]  are.
[3:55:55.840 --> 3:56:01.840]  Forced population reduction, sterilization, euthanization, very, very evil.
[3:56:01.840 --> 3:56:06.280]  And then we have to have a debate about how they plan to politically block us.
[3:56:06.280 --> 3:56:08.080]  The voting machines are almost completely taken over.
[3:56:08.080 --> 3:56:10.920]  We've got to fight back and try to take those back.
[3:56:10.920 --> 3:56:14.480]  We've got to take over local governments peacefully, and we've got to realize that marches on
[3:56:14.480 --> 3:56:17.680]  D.C. or London won't work, they have said they'll drop neutron bombs on us, and it's
[3:56:17.680 --> 3:56:21.280]  a public statement, okay?
[3:56:21.280 --> 3:56:26.040]  You've got to take it over as a cultural movement to where everybody is just aware that there
[3:56:26.040 --> 3:56:31.560]  is this false reality that we're in while the gatekeepers and while the social engineers,
[3:56:31.560 --> 3:56:36.920]  the true architects of this nightmare system are in control above us and we have to not
[3:56:36.920 --> 3:56:41.160]  play along with them anymore because they can't, they parasitically feed off us at
[3:56:41.160 --> 3:56:42.160]  least for now.
[3:56:42.160 --> 3:56:45.440]  And that was the total key I never got to earlier.
[3:56:45.440 --> 3:56:49.280]  They're admitting by 2012 most of the Air Force will be robotic.
[3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:54.280]  And then soon it won't just be people piloting those from control pods of thousands of miles
[3:56:54.280 --> 3:56:56.200]  away or on aircraft carriers.
[3:56:56.200 --> 3:57:00.840]  It's going to be artificially programmed with battle plans, programmed by master programmers
[3:57:00.840 --> 3:57:04.080]  and implemented and carried out by supercomputers.
[3:57:04.080 --> 3:57:07.920]  And so see, we're getting to the point where the military says they're going to have huge
[3:57:07.920 --> 3:57:13.480]  landing craft land and discourage, you know, thousands of robot combat mechs, little, little
[3:57:13.480 --> 3:57:19.680]  buzz drones that fly up and blow your head off, just huge fleets of robotic forces to
[3:57:19.680 --> 3:57:23.120]  aware they don't even need the military and the police anymore.
[3:57:23.120 --> 3:57:28.680]  So see, that's why the shadow government is trying to get to the point where even if
[3:57:28.680 --> 3:57:33.960]  they're, they've already war-gamed out that there may be an organic resistance peacefully
[3:57:33.960 --> 3:57:36.880]  by non-compliance.
[3:57:36.880 --> 3:57:40.440]  And so they're moving to try to block that right now.
[3:57:40.440 --> 3:57:44.720]  I want to write up a bunch of notes and really codify this more clearly for you, but I've
[3:57:44.720 --> 3:57:45.720]  war-gamed it all out.
[3:57:45.720 --> 3:57:47.320]  I've read enough of their documents to understand it.
[3:57:47.320 --> 3:57:51.000]  I really went into this in a lot of detail about the nature of evil in the first hour.
[3:57:51.000 --> 3:57:55.760]  It was very important and rebroadcast on the Internet only at oneplace, infowarrants.com
[3:57:55.760 --> 3:57:56.760]  and prismplanet.com.
[3:57:56.760 --> 3:57:58.320]  You've got to go to those streams right now.
[3:57:58.320 --> 3:58:10.600]  For those that are listening, we'll be back in one minute.
