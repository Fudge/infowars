[00:00.000 --> 00:19.720]  When is enough going to be enough?
[00:19.720 --> 00:24.360]  When is the death toll, the genocide, by medical tyranny going to be enough to wake
[00:24.360 --> 00:29.720]  up humanity, Congress, the governors, to stand against this global UN takeover?
[00:29.720 --> 00:35.880]  It is Sunday, March 24th, the year of 2021, and marvelous Marvin Hagler, one of my favorite
[00:35.880 --> 00:40.280]  boxers, world champion mediumway, died.
[00:40.280 --> 00:45.040]  And friends and family said that he was admitted to the hospital one day after getting an mRNA
[00:45.040 --> 00:51.920]  vaccine and was fighting for his life from the quote, effects of the vaccine and died.
[00:51.920 --> 00:56.520]  When we come back next segment on this live Sunday transmission with myself and on destroyer,
[00:56.520 --> 01:00.920]  we're going to lay out the facts and what's really happening and how to stop it.
[01:00.920 --> 01:05.400]  Because after all, they're having a big problem covering up the incredible death toll.
[01:05.400 --> 01:10.160]  The question is, why would they roll something out like this, knowing that we get caught?
[01:10.160 --> 01:13.160]  Who's got a gun to big farmers head to do this?
[01:13.160 --> 01:15.280]  I've got the answer straight ahead.
[01:15.280 --> 01:16.280]  This is InfoWars.
[01:16.280 --> 01:17.280]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:17.280 --> 01:18.280]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:18.280 --> 01:25.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer sitting in the InfoWars world headquarters here in
[01:25.920 --> 01:26.920]  Austin, Texas.
[01:26.920 --> 01:32.200]  I have a ton of news that I'm going to be getting to in the next two hours.
[01:32.200 --> 01:37.400]  Of course, we have a emergency report coming up from Alex Jones on that subject that you
[01:37.400 --> 01:40.320]  just heard of, people dying from the vaccine.
[01:40.320 --> 01:49.760]  And it's a real strange time to be alive because if you're having conversations with
[01:49.760 --> 01:56.920]  people, you realize, hey, you know what, even the liberals, even the Trump dissidents, even
[01:56.920 --> 02:04.280]  some of the TDS people are kind of starting to realize, hmm, maybe I've been duped.
[02:04.280 --> 02:06.360]  Maybe I've become a polling of the establishment.
[02:06.360 --> 02:09.200]  Hey, you know, I don't want to take a vaccine.
[02:09.200 --> 02:16.800]  Hey, I don't want to wear a mask, but now that you see some things starting to reopen,
[02:16.800 --> 02:19.480]  people starting to get out into the world again, they realize, you know, maybe there's
[02:19.480 --> 02:20.800]  nothing to be afraid of.
[02:20.800 --> 02:21.920]  Maybe I shouldn't be so afraid.
[02:21.920 --> 02:31.080]  And so what we're seeing now is it's the most brainwashed, propagandized Stockholm syndrome
[02:31.080 --> 02:38.560]  people are going to go deeper into their trance, deeper into their programming and really just
[02:38.560 --> 02:45.360]  fully commit to this, to being pawns of the New World Order versus people who are kind
[02:45.360 --> 02:50.040]  of just deceived, but maybe didn't really invest too much time or research into these
[02:50.040 --> 02:54.960]  issues, but did what they felt was good emotionally and kind of bought in the mainstream propaganda.
[02:54.960 --> 03:00.000]  Didn't really think all the networks and Hollywood celebs were relying on them, but now they're
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.480]  kind of starting to open their eyes as the tyranny gets worse.
[03:04.480 --> 03:07.400]  Freedom is popular.
[03:07.400 --> 03:14.280]  And you can only take freedom away from people who yearn to be free for so long before almost
[03:14.280 --> 03:21.200]  like a drug addict kind of, except it's not a drug, but you want it again, you want to
[03:21.200 --> 03:22.200]  be free.
[03:22.200 --> 03:24.120]  You want to go out and not see a bunch of people in mass.
[03:24.120 --> 03:26.680]  You want to be able to go back to work without taking a vaccine.
[03:26.680 --> 03:30.200]  You're sick of debating should the schools be open or closed.
[03:30.200 --> 03:32.200]  You're sick of wondering, can I go to church this week or not?
[03:32.200 --> 03:36.440]  You're sick of wondering, when can I take the mask off?
[03:36.440 --> 03:43.400]  But I'm noticing as some people are kind of having their awakening, even celebrities
[03:43.400 --> 03:47.280]  will talk about like Sarah Silverman, oh, she doesn't want to be associated with the
[03:47.280 --> 03:48.680]  Democrat party anymore.
[03:48.680 --> 03:51.560]  Oh, that's funny.
[03:51.560 --> 03:53.080]  But hey, good for her.
[03:53.080 --> 03:54.080]  Maybe she's getting it.
[03:54.080 --> 03:55.080]  You know what?
[03:55.080 --> 03:57.920]  I was just used by these people and now I look like an idiot.
[03:57.920 --> 04:01.920]  I don't want to look like that anymore.
[04:01.920 --> 04:04.400]  Good for her.
[04:04.400 --> 04:06.960]  But there's all kinds of weirdness going on.
[04:06.960 --> 04:11.760]  We've got a video of a lady who's a hero here in Texas who got arrested for refusing to
[04:11.760 --> 04:15.200]  wear a mask into a bank of America.
[04:15.200 --> 04:20.640]  You don't make it really hard to be with back the blue and make it really hard to fully
[04:20.640 --> 04:21.960]  commit to blue lives matter.
[04:21.960 --> 04:29.720]  When you see stuff like this, it's going to really make it hard not to say defund the
[04:29.720 --> 04:34.240]  police when they're being used to arrest kind old ladies like this.
[04:34.240 --> 04:35.600]  I shouldn't even call her old.
[04:35.600 --> 04:40.160]  She's obviously young at heart and spirit.
[04:40.160 --> 04:41.160]  She gets arrested.
[04:41.160 --> 04:45.080]  She gets thrown to the ground because she doesn't want to put a mask on.
[04:45.080 --> 04:47.760]  I mean, how dare she want to breathe free air?
[04:47.760 --> 04:51.240]  Oh, by the way, more bad news for Cuomo.
[04:51.240 --> 04:54.320]  You thought he just sent COVID into the nursing homes?
[04:54.320 --> 04:55.320]  Uh-oh.
[04:55.320 --> 05:00.800]  Looks like he got caught sending it somewhere else as well.
[05:00.800 --> 05:04.840]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[05:04.840 --> 05:07.800]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[05:07.800 --> 05:10.520]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[05:10.520 --> 05:13.520]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[05:13.520 --> 05:14.520]  That's what Jesus said.
[05:14.520 --> 05:17.400]  My people perish for lack of knowledge.
[05:17.400 --> 05:18.680]  Knowledge is power.
[05:18.680 --> 05:24.440]  Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential
[05:24.440 --> 05:26.280]  vitamins and minerals.
[05:26.280 --> 05:29.520]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because
[05:29.520 --> 05:32.520]  it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[05:32.520 --> 05:37.000]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.880]  there in a liquid vitamin form, is now back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[05:40.880 --> 05:43.680]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[05:43.680 --> 05:46.840]  It funds the info war at the same time.
[05:46.840 --> 05:49.160]  No other product you can buy does that.
[05:49.160 --> 05:53.440]  So again, infowarstore.com, it's back in stock, 50% off.
[05:53.440 --> 05:54.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion.
[05:54.440 --> 05:56.600]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[05:56.600 --> 06:07.760]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[06:07.760 --> 06:14.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:14.280 --> 06:18.160]  front lines of the info war.
[06:18.160 --> 06:24.800]  The undisputed middleweight champion of the world, marvelous Marvin Hackler, is dead today
[06:24.800 --> 06:26.920]  according to friends and family.
[06:26.920 --> 06:28.360]  He died from the effects of the vaccine.
[06:28.360 --> 06:35.040]  He was admitted to the emergency room yesterday and died today after taking the vaccine, just
[06:35.040 --> 06:36.040]  like Hank Aaron.
[06:36.040 --> 06:38.640]  And I'll talk about that here in just a moment.
[06:38.640 --> 06:43.520]  But if you remember last year, Bill Gates said on national TV that 80% of people would
[06:43.520 --> 06:49.760]  get bad side effects and that 700,000 people would get sick or die.
[06:49.760 --> 06:53.960]  Think about that, ladies and gentlemen, how would he even know that with unapproved vaccines
[06:53.960 --> 06:56.640]  that they're now testing that are unapproved?
[06:56.640 --> 07:01.360]  Because they tested them secretly in animals years before they rolled out COVID-19.
[07:01.360 --> 07:03.800]  This is a large strategic plan.
[07:03.800 --> 07:06.160]  It's not the virus you've got to fear.
[07:06.160 --> 07:08.120]  It is the effects of the vaccine.
[07:08.120 --> 07:13.080]  It's not a vaccine that's mRNA and goes in and reprograms your body and makes your body
[07:13.080 --> 07:14.080]  attack itself.
[07:14.080 --> 07:18.040]  That's why two and a half months ago, England, one weekend of their vaccination program,
[07:18.040 --> 07:23.200]  the first country to do it, they banned giving above 75-year-olds the shot because it was
[07:23.200 --> 07:24.680]  killing so many.
[07:24.680 --> 07:26.200]  Well, marvelous.
[07:26.200 --> 07:28.800]  Marvin Hagler was 66.
[07:28.800 --> 07:30.880]  They also say pregnant women shouldn't take it.
[07:30.880 --> 07:36.160]  Doesn't stop the U.S. government pushing on pregnant women and children, including babies.
[07:36.160 --> 07:37.160]  So he's dead now.
[07:37.160 --> 07:42.320]  Now, it's easy to cover up the massive deaths in nursing homes, the massing deaths at non-convents
[07:42.320 --> 07:47.800]  and the massive deaths taking place inside hospitals from the vaccine.
[07:47.800 --> 07:51.760]  But all the famous people dying from it, they're having a real problem.
[07:51.760 --> 07:59.360]  And if you remember when Hank Aaron died after taking the second shot of the Pfizer shot,
[07:59.360 --> 08:01.360]  the media said, oh, we talked to the medical examiner.
[08:01.360 --> 08:02.360]  They did an autopsy.
[08:02.360 --> 08:04.080]  He didn't die of the COVID-19 vaccine.
[08:04.080 --> 08:09.560]  The family came out and told Robert Kennedy, Jr. that they didn't do an autopsy and that
[08:09.560 --> 08:11.720]  he died after the second shot.
[08:11.720 --> 08:16.320]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I have stacks of articles every day of 25-year-old women,
[08:16.320 --> 08:19.840]  15-year-old men, 80-year-old people, 35-year-old people.
[08:19.840 --> 08:24.200]  I mean, you name it, dying constantly, and these are just the ones that are getting reported
[08:24.200 --> 08:25.200]  to the press.
[08:25.200 --> 08:27.480]  We're talking about the organs liquefying.
[08:27.480 --> 08:29.480]  Here's just one on infowars.com today.
[08:29.480 --> 08:32.440]  There's like five of them up there today.
[08:32.440 --> 08:38.400]  Physical therapist 28 dies two days after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.
[08:38.400 --> 08:42.680]  Out in Utah, this 30-something-year-old mother had a nine-year-old daughter, totally healthy,
[08:42.680 --> 08:47.640]  a nurse took the vaccine, her liver liquefied, and they said she died of the vaccine, but
[08:47.640 --> 08:48.640]  it'd be hard to prove.
[08:48.640 --> 08:53.080]  The medical examiner said, plus these companies have liability protection from this.
[08:53.080 --> 08:55.920]  So are you going to sit here and take this?
[08:55.920 --> 08:56.920]  Why are they doing it?
[08:56.920 --> 08:59.040]  Why would they roll something out, skip animal trials?
[08:59.040 --> 09:02.800]  Because they already did animal trials under the guise of other similar vaccines before
[09:02.800 --> 09:06.760]  and knew what it did to the animals, which would sterilize them, make them sick, make
[09:06.760 --> 09:11.280]  them have autoimmune disorders, make them have a cytokine storm, really bad, allergic
[09:11.280 --> 09:12.720]  reactions.
[09:12.720 --> 09:16.160]  And most of the top scientists, including the former chief scientist at Pfizer, went
[09:16.160 --> 09:21.040]  public and said, don't take this, and followed an emergency injunction back in December with
[09:21.040 --> 09:27.520]  Wolfgang Wudard in the EU, and India, and Switzerland, and South Africa, and a bunch
[09:27.520 --> 09:31.240]  of other countries have pulled these vaccines and said they're not safe, and said, plus
[09:31.240 --> 09:33.960]  they don't protect you from COVID-19.
[09:33.960 --> 09:34.960]  And guess what?
[09:34.960 --> 09:36.480]  That's in the news today as well.
[09:36.480 --> 09:40.960]  Canadian Health Chief says COVID restrictions may continue even after taking the vaccine.
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.160]  And Biden went on TV three nights ago and said, it doesn't matter if you have the vaccine,
[09:44.160 --> 09:45.280]  you're still locked down.
[09:45.280 --> 09:47.160]  This is permanent martial law.
[09:47.160 --> 09:49.080]  You can't create a vaccine for the common cold.
[09:49.080 --> 09:53.000]  COVID is a patented synthetic cold virus, so they own it.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.880]  Anybody will die without vitamin B12, without vitamin D3, without vitamin C and zinc.
[09:57.880 --> 09:59.400]  If you don't have those things, you die.
[09:59.400 --> 10:01.000]  Any virus can kill you.
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.360]  Any virus can go and replicate yourselves.
[10:04.360 --> 10:07.240]  That's why they don't want you to know that, or about hydroxychloroquine, or any of it,
[10:07.240 --> 10:09.840]  ladies and gentlemen, any of it.
[10:09.840 --> 10:10.840]  So this is a takeover.
[10:10.840 --> 10:15.720]  And they want to just normalize it, be a hero, go take the shots, so all these sports icons
[10:15.720 --> 10:18.320]  roll their sleeves up, they go take it, and they die.
[10:18.320 --> 10:20.600]  And then of course you've got Ben Stein.
[10:20.600 --> 10:24.880]  He took one of the mRNA vaccines and called it a killer, but said, oh, I'm not attacking
[10:24.880 --> 10:29.960]  vaccines because he knows you'll get demonized if you do that, because big techs merge with
[10:29.960 --> 10:31.760]  big pharma and says you can't do it.
[10:31.760 --> 10:36.880]  A word of warning to you, my fellow Americans, or whatever you are.
[10:36.880 --> 10:43.840]  I had the COVID booster, the Moderna, about four or five days ago, and I am still feeling
[10:43.840 --> 10:49.600]  wild side effects from it, like I had the worst flu in the world, extreme shortness
[10:49.600 --> 10:58.440]  of breath, a dizziness, fatigue, extremely irrational thinking, it has just been devastating.
[10:58.440 --> 11:05.920]  I'm glad I got it, sort of glad, I'm a little bit glad, and also not quite so glad.
[11:05.920 --> 11:13.400]  But it has just got to be told to the people, us people, we people, us people, that this
[11:13.400 --> 11:14.400]  booster is a killer.
[11:14.400 --> 11:21.400]  I mean, it's not going to kill you literally, but it is very, very strong, beware.
[11:21.400 --> 11:27.480]  So Marvellous Marvin Hagler could survive all those incredible boxing matches, he could
[11:27.480 --> 11:33.480]  go through all the grueling training, he could be the world champion, and be loved all over
[11:33.480 --> 11:38.560]  the world, and he could be successful in life and defeat all those adversities, but he couldn't
[11:38.560 --> 11:44.720]  at 66 years old defeat the vaccine that he took, which they're saying is an mRNA vaccine.
[11:44.720 --> 11:47.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can't have companies with liability protection that are allowed
[11:47.920 --> 11:52.040]  to do this, and then have government try to mandate it and make us take it to be able
[11:52.040 --> 11:54.040]  to taste freedom as CNN said.
[11:54.040 --> 11:56.720]  And of course, they didn't take that freedom away as well.
[11:56.720 --> 12:00.480]  This is a black hole, this is a bear trap, this is a takeover.
[12:00.480 --> 12:05.960]  So I'm going to leave you with some of the famous highlights of Marvellous Marvin Hagler,
[12:05.960 --> 12:09.600]  and then we're going to go to the live show today with Owen Schreuer doing a great job
[12:09.600 --> 12:10.600]  here on The Allen Schoen Show.
[12:10.600 --> 12:18.120]  I'll be back in studio tomorrow, 11 a.m. central, but be safe out there, and one more point.
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.800]  I have friends, I have neighbors, I have family that are like, Alex, we've heard your opinion
[12:21.800 --> 12:25.400]  about the vaccine, we've heard your opinion about the death numbers being exaggerated.
[12:25.400 --> 12:27.320]  You're probably right, but stop giving us information.
[12:27.320 --> 12:31.480]  Well, you know what, I'm going to give my friends, my family, my neighbors information.
[12:31.480 --> 12:36.680]  If more people would have warned folks about Hank Arendine, then Marvellous Marvin Hagler
[12:36.680 --> 12:40.280]  probably wouldn't have died, and many, many others, because remember, he's famous, he's
[12:40.280 --> 12:41.280]  a world champion.
[12:41.280 --> 12:44.640]  The average person in a nursing home getting killed, you're not hearing about.
[12:44.640 --> 12:47.880]  Most nursing homes are in on it, they're not reporting it, but the ones that do are like,
[12:47.880 --> 12:53.280]  yeah, we got 50 people, three died, we got 100 people, 10 died, we've got 200 done, 15
[12:53.280 --> 12:54.280]  died.
[12:54.280 --> 12:56.480]  I mean, these are the numbers coming out.
[12:56.480 --> 13:00.480]  Large numbers of old people die within hours or days of taking it.
[13:00.480 --> 13:04.960]  This is euthanasia, and Bill Gates runs this whole thing, and famously said, get rid of
[13:04.960 --> 13:07.560]  old people.
[13:07.560 --> 13:12.360]  To quote, save money, it's eugenics, it's teaching you to have no heart, to have no soul, and
[13:12.360 --> 13:16.160]  to not value your humanity, and once you don't value your humanity, the globalists can take
[13:16.160 --> 13:17.160]  your rights as well.
[13:17.160 --> 13:19.360]  We need to come together and defend each other's freedoms.
[13:19.360 --> 13:24.200]  That's why they're dividing us along race, and religion, and sex, and all this crap because
[13:24.200 --> 13:26.600]  it's an anti-human globalist takeover.
[13:26.600 --> 13:30.360]  We've all got our differences, but we also have the globalists out to get all of us.
[13:30.360 --> 13:32.720]  So that should unify us against the new world order.
[13:32.720 --> 13:37.040]  An info war stands steadfastly here as a beacon of truth, war in the world.
[13:37.040 --> 13:41.120]  So remember, all of you, spread the word tonight about this broadcast, and what really happened
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.240]  to Hank Aaron, to Marvellous Marvin, and so many others.
[13:45.240 --> 13:47.200]  God bless my friends, and good luck.
[13:47.200 --> 13:49.200]  Now the show's turned over to Owen Schreuer.
[13:49.200 --> 14:18.200]  Well, as you pointed out before, and Hagler is a very strong guy, but he's a flopper.
[14:18.200 --> 14:21.200]  What do you mean by a clever?
[14:21.200 --> 14:24.200]  Well, he does not have that real snap in the punch.
[14:24.200 --> 14:26.200]  He has strong arms.
[14:26.200 --> 14:27.200]  Oh!
[14:27.200 --> 14:28.200]  Oh!
[14:28.200 --> 14:29.200]  That right hand was the number.
[14:29.200 --> 14:30.200]  Well, we have 47 seconds to go.
[14:30.200 --> 14:31.200]  No, it's all over, Gil.
[14:31.200 --> 14:32.200]  Yeah, it looks that way.
[14:32.200 --> 14:33.200]  It's all over.
[14:33.200 --> 14:34.200]  They should stop this fight.
[14:34.200 --> 14:35.200]  Hagler just looked at the referee and asked him to stop it.
[14:35.200 --> 14:36.200]  Well, it's all over.
[14:36.200 --> 14:49.200]  He must have lost it just now, but he punched it back in himself.
[14:49.200 --> 15:00.200]  Warren, a good left hook for a change, and another.
[15:00.200 --> 15:26.200]  We have just been watching some replays of Marvellous Marvin Hagler, who, Thomas Hearns,
[15:26.200 --> 15:31.200]  is back today, first reported Hagler in the ICU after taking COVID vaccines.
[15:31.200 --> 15:32.200]  Very bad side effects.
[15:32.200 --> 15:33.200]  Died hours later.
[15:33.200 --> 15:36.200]  So we're going to have more of that coming up.
[15:36.200 --> 15:39.200]  You know, it's weird watching old sports.
[15:39.200 --> 15:47.200]  It's almost sad because old sports were so much more fun and so much more enjoyable and
[15:47.200 --> 15:50.200]  palatable and consumable than what you get nowadays.
[15:50.200 --> 15:57.200]  It's more fun to watch replays of old sports than anything new, and it's just a sign of
[15:57.200 --> 15:59.200]  how culture is going.
[15:59.200 --> 16:03.200]  Blisters ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[16:03.200 --> 16:06.200]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[16:06.200 --> 16:07.200]  Why do you do that?
[16:07.200 --> 16:09.200]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[16:09.200 --> 16:14.200]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists, they say, hey, a lot of people love Deep Earth
[16:14.200 --> 16:18.200]  pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth crystal iodine and the
[16:18.200 --> 16:21.200]  other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[16:21.200 --> 16:22.200]  Boom, we did it.
[16:22.200 --> 16:23.200]  It's popular at sex three.
[16:23.200 --> 16:24.200]  Is it better than the next two?
[16:24.200 --> 16:25.200]  You decide.
[16:25.200 --> 16:27.200]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[16:27.200 --> 16:32.200]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping,
[16:32.200 --> 16:34.200]  and that is down and out.
[16:34.200 --> 16:38.200]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.200]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[16:43.200 --> 16:45.200]  at m4store.com and free shipping.
[16:45.200 --> 16:48.200]  Secure you're down and out today, and while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the
[16:48.200 --> 16:49.200]  m4 at the same time.
[16:49.200 --> 16:54.200]  Down and out, exclusively available at m4store.com and 40% off and free shipping.
[16:54.200 --> 17:14.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[17:14.200 --> 17:19.200]  Infowars has been banned.
[17:19.200 --> 17:23.200]  Arrested.
[17:23.200 --> 17:25.200]  Act and threatened.
[17:25.200 --> 17:28.200]  Because we are effective.
[17:28.200 --> 17:31.200]  The great awakening is here.
[17:31.200 --> 17:33.200]  Go to banned.video.
[17:33.200 --> 17:37.200]  Download the videos and share.
[17:37.200 --> 18:00.200]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[18:00.200 --> 18:06.200]  Every product you hear me on air advertising, we have it stock in our warehouse in Austin,
[18:06.200 --> 18:07.200]  Texas.
[18:07.200 --> 18:08.200]  Every product.
[18:08.200 --> 18:12.200]  So if you order it, we've got it shipped out in a couple of days, sometimes the same day.
[18:12.200 --> 18:16.200]  Lizards get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's breaking
[18:16.200 --> 18:23.200]  down and its future orders, its product we're trying to reorder to get back in that we're
[18:23.200 --> 18:24.200]  having trouble with.
[18:24.200 --> 18:30.200]  I'm talking about double, triple, quadruple delivery times, and it's across not just the
[18:30.200 --> 18:33.200]  supplement, vitamin, mineral industry, it's across every industry.
[18:33.200 --> 18:37.200]  So the globalists have successfully devastated the economy.
[18:37.200 --> 18:39.200]  That's what I'm saying.
[18:39.200 --> 18:43.200]  You need to visit infowarstore.com today and get high quality supplements while you still
[18:43.200 --> 18:46.200]  can, and storeable food at infowarstore.com.
[18:46.200 --> 18:48.200]  Because we have it in stock, it's ready to ship.
[18:48.200 --> 18:53.200]  But with the supply chain breakdowns, prices are going up, availability is going down,
[18:53.200 --> 18:54.200]  and it's just crazy.
[18:54.200 --> 19:00.200]  So please get products while you still can and support the infowarstore.com.
[19:00.200 --> 19:03.200]  My enemies are your enemies.
[19:03.200 --> 19:04.200]  They're the globalists.
[19:04.200 --> 19:05.200]  They're an extremist.
[19:05.200 --> 19:11.200]  They are a consortium of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers,
[19:11.200 --> 19:17.200]  vampires, whatever you want to call them, that are highly predatory, and are setting up a
[19:17.200 --> 19:24.200]  false famously land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic
[19:24.200 --> 19:31.200]  regime to change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they
[19:31.200 --> 19:34.200]  can control, like a pawn on a chessboard.
[19:34.200 --> 19:40.200]  The bottom line is they want to play God, and they are playing God, and the news is only
[19:40.200 --> 19:42.200]  going to tie it around our necks from here on out.
[19:42.200 --> 19:44.200]  So many other people want to be positive.
[19:44.200 --> 19:48.200]  They want to put out fake news, and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening
[19:48.200 --> 19:49.200]  with New World Order.
[19:49.200 --> 19:51.200]  But at the end of the day, it's all about the population.
[19:51.200 --> 19:54.200]  It's all about world government.
[19:54.200 --> 19:57.200]  It's all about the end of the human system, as we know it, and on its ashes, a nightmare
[19:57.200 --> 20:03.200]  being built, only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[20:03.200 --> 20:13.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:13.200 --> 20:19.200]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[20:19.200 --> 20:22.200]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[20:22.200 --> 20:29.200]  We're going to get all the news in the next hour and a half here on the Alex Jones Show.
[20:29.200 --> 20:38.200]  We've got liberal Democrat progressives, the Biden promotion remorse, the Biden voter remorse,
[20:38.200 --> 20:43.200]  the liberal party, Democrat party politic remorse.
[20:43.200 --> 20:46.200]  You've got more people dropping dead of the vaccine.
[20:46.200 --> 20:51.200]  They can't hide it anymore, though they deny it.
[20:51.200 --> 20:53.200]  You've got odd developments now.
[20:53.200 --> 20:56.200]  I know that we don't care about the royal family.
[20:56.200 --> 21:00.200]  But you see, this is a global cabal that we're dealing with.
[21:00.200 --> 21:09.200]  And so there's a hint of that with what's going on with Meghan Markle and the fake Prince Harry.
[21:09.200 --> 21:12.200]  And so we'll touch on that a little bit.
[21:12.200 --> 21:19.200]  You have left-wing Democrat terrorism taking place all weekend long.
[21:19.200 --> 21:22.200]  Did you even hear about it in the mainstream news?
[21:22.200 --> 21:32.200]  Across the nation, in the name of Floyd, in the name of Breonna Taylor, in the name of what other mainstream media propaganda they push
[21:32.200 --> 21:37.200]  to get black people to hate police or white people or burn their cities to the ground.
[21:37.200 --> 21:39.200]  Yeah, it happened all weekend long.
[21:39.200 --> 21:41.200]  You didn't hear about it, though, did you?
[21:41.200 --> 21:43.200]  So we've got that coming up.
[21:43.200 --> 21:47.200]  Meanwhile, you still don't know who shot Ashley Babbitt.
[21:47.200 --> 21:51.200]  So once again, the big lie of racism and police exposed again,
[21:51.200 --> 21:55.200]  whether there was a white person, well, what about Ashley Babbitt?
[21:55.200 --> 22:01.200]  And we don't get to know her shooter, executed on film.
[22:01.200 --> 22:08.200]  But they don't rally, they don't riot, they don't say her name.
[22:08.200 --> 22:11.200]  But so we'll cover all the left-wing violence coming up.
[22:11.200 --> 22:19.200]  And then also you have a woman arrested and beaten by a police officer for refusing to wear a mask in a Bank of America,
[22:19.200 --> 22:24.200]  which is ironic since the mask mandate has been lifted here in Texas.
[22:24.200 --> 22:30.200]  And I went out this weekend to socialize really for the first time in a while.
[22:30.200 --> 22:37.200]  And the streets of Austin were packed, hundreds lined up to go into bars.
[22:37.200 --> 22:39.200]  Some people were still wearing their masks.
[22:39.200 --> 22:42.200]  I chose not to and was pleasantly never asked to put one on.
[22:42.200 --> 22:44.200]  Boy, that's nice to be free.
[22:44.200 --> 22:46.200]  Hey, you want to wear the mask? Fine.
[22:46.200 --> 22:50.200]  I don't, my friends don't, and no one bothered us about it, and that's nice.
[22:50.200 --> 22:51.200]  And guess what?
[22:51.200 --> 22:56.200]  Of the thousands of people that were out packed into bars in Austin, Texas this weekend,
[22:56.200 --> 22:57.200]  nobody's going to get sick.
[22:57.200 --> 23:00.200]  But that doesn't matter.
[23:00.200 --> 23:03.200]  We got a vaccine, we got to sell you.
[23:03.200 --> 23:06.200]  We got fear, we got to sell you.
[23:06.200 --> 23:13.200]  We got to put our boot on your neck and we have to lie to you via the mainstream media to get you to comply.
[23:13.200 --> 23:17.200]  Oh, and also bad news for Andrew Cuomo.
[23:17.200 --> 23:19.200]  It only gets worse for Cuomo.
[23:19.200 --> 23:25.200]  And so if you thought the nursing home desk were going to go away with the six or seven or whatever accusers now we're at,
[23:25.200 --> 23:34.200]  the number of accusers against Cuomo, well, a new ripple in this story has just come about.
[23:34.200 --> 23:42.200]  It looks like Cuomo was not only sending COVID into the nursing home,
[23:42.200 --> 23:52.200]  but was also sending COVID into offices, the New York office for people with developmental disabilities,
[23:52.200 --> 23:56.200]  where they have like housing and staffing, taking care of people with disabilities.
[23:56.200 --> 24:05.200]  It looks like Cuomo also sent people with COVID into there, which once again resulted in, in this case,
[24:05.200 --> 24:11.200]  at least hundreds of deaths and thousands of infections.
[24:11.200 --> 24:16.200]  So the Cuomo legacy just gets worse.
[24:16.200 --> 24:23.200]  But how about marvelous Marvin Hagler dead after receiving a COVID vaccine?
[24:23.200 --> 24:25.200]  Now, let's be clear about something.
[24:25.200 --> 24:30.200]  You want to know there's an agenda. You want to know there's a narrative.
[24:30.200 --> 24:32.200]  You want to know the signs.
[24:32.200 --> 24:36.200]  So tell me how this works.
[24:36.200 --> 24:43.200]  Every person that dies, they look for any reason to say that that death was from COVID.
[24:43.200 --> 24:45.200]  Well, why would that be?
[24:45.200 --> 24:52.200]  Well, the hospitals get $12,000 payouts for having COVID positive patients and then they get a bonus $49,000.
[24:52.200 --> 24:57.200]  This is just kind of the average of what these hospitals are making.
[24:57.200 --> 25:00.200]  This is all confirmed by doctors and everything.
[25:00.200 --> 25:06.200]  And then you can get about $49,000 if you put them on ventilators, which may blow their lungs out and kill them.
[25:06.200 --> 25:08.200]  You get the payday. It doesn't matter to you.
[25:08.200 --> 25:15.200]  So everything is COVID. The flu is COVID, pneumonia is COVID, cancer is COVID, Lou Gehrig's disease is COVID,
[25:15.200 --> 25:18.200]  run over by a car is COVID, shoot yourself in the head is COVID.
[25:18.200 --> 25:22.200]  It's all COVID and the hospitals get the payout so they don't mind.
[25:22.200 --> 25:25.200]  Yes, sure, this person came in with multiple gunshot wounds, COVID.
[25:25.200 --> 25:28.200]  And that's a common story. Just look at the Denver Death Count.
[25:28.200 --> 25:29.200]  Look at all of them.
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.200]  So it's always COVID, no matter what, because there's an agenda there.
[25:34.200 --> 25:37.200]  Well, how about look at the response with the vaccine?
[25:37.200 --> 25:42.200]  Well, it's the truth. Hank Aaron got the vaccine and then unexpectedly died.
[25:42.200 --> 25:49.200]  It's true that marvelous Marvin Hagler got the vaccine and then within hours died.
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.200]  That's just true. Both unexpected deaths.
[25:52.200 --> 25:58.200]  They don't know why they died and why won't they even mention the vaccine because, see, that's part of the agenda.
[25:58.200 --> 26:03.200]  So the agenda was everything's COVID, but with the vaccine, nothing is the vaccine.
[26:03.200 --> 26:15.200]  That's clear and present evidence that there is an agenda afoot when that's the dichotomy of the coverage and the approach to these two different circumstances.
[26:15.200 --> 26:18.200]  Everything's COVID, nothing is ever the vaccine.
[26:18.200 --> 26:25.200]  It doesn't matter that Bill Gates admits there's going to be thousands of people that have negative side effects or hundreds of thousands.
[26:25.200 --> 26:27.200]  It doesn't matter. He admits that on TV.
[26:27.200 --> 26:33.200]  The main guy pushing this is the main advocate. Why? I don't know. I guess you could take a guess.
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.200]  Or you could just listen to his own speech at TED Talk saying he wants all humans to die.
[26:37.200 --> 26:45.200]  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm paraphrasing. He said he only wants carbon emissions down to zero, which in his mathematical formula that he puts on the board that had P in it representing people.
[26:45.200 --> 26:49.200]  He said that had to get to zero. But, you know, just paraphrasing, he wants you dead.
[26:49.200 --> 27:06.200]  So he promotes the vaccine and then Fauci in an incredible interview with a Mexican comedian actor admits in the live interview just what InfoWars has been saying.
[27:06.200 --> 27:11.200]  This is not a vaccine. This is a brand new science. This is a brand new technology.
[27:11.200 --> 27:15.200]  Biotechnology never been used before. We're testing it on you humans right now.
[27:15.200 --> 27:19.200]  I don't want to play the video because I aired it 100 times on Friday.
[27:19.200 --> 27:26.200]  But the full video is at band.video and in stories. Just linked into stories at infowars.com.
[27:26.200 --> 27:30.200]  But then Fauci has the nerve to come out the next day.
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.200]  So after Fauci says this is an experimental technology, it's not even a vaccine.
[27:35.200 --> 27:38.200]  We're testing it on humans right now for the first time in a live interview.
[27:38.200 --> 27:40.200]  We admit to all of that.
[27:40.200 --> 27:44.200]  Making InfoWars next year's news today.
[27:44.200 --> 27:52.200]  And then the next day he comes out and he says it's disturbing that Trump voters are skeptical of the experimental mRNA vaccine.
[27:52.200 --> 27:56.200]  Oh, it's disturbing that we're free thinkers to Anthony Fauci.
[27:56.200 --> 28:00.200]  It's disturbing that we believe we have medical freedom of choice.
[28:00.200 --> 28:02.200]  That's disturbing to Anthony Fauci.
[28:02.200 --> 28:05.200]  See, he wants everybody to roll up that sleeve and take that jab.
[28:05.200 --> 28:11.200]  He's a medical tyrant.
[28:11.200 --> 28:18.200]  And then he's urging that Trump tells his supporters to get the COVID vaccine.
[28:18.200 --> 28:20.200]  Oh, that's not scary at all.
[28:20.200 --> 28:22.200]  So let me get this straight.
[28:22.200 --> 28:25.200]  A virus so deadly, I don't even know I have it.
[28:25.200 --> 28:31.200]  And a vaccine so effective and efficient that you have to force me to take it.
[28:31.200 --> 28:35.200]  Something doesn't add up there.
[28:35.200 --> 28:39.200]  Something seems to be missing there.
[28:39.200 --> 28:46.200]  And then he admits it's an untested science and we have all these people dying after they take the vaccine.
[28:46.200 --> 28:49.200]  Hmm. Hmm.
[28:49.200 --> 28:53.200]  What common sense and logic would say, I don't trust Fauci.
[28:53.200 --> 29:00.200]  I don't trust the vaccine and I'm still alive and the death count hasn't changed in the deadliest pandemic ever, huh?
[29:00.200 --> 29:05.200]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be,
[29:05.200 --> 29:09.200]  you have to understand that this is all a test.
[29:09.200 --> 29:14.200]  This experience, this wife on this planet is a reckoning.
[29:14.200 --> 29:23.200]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[29:23.200 --> 29:25.200]  And it really does come down to that.
[29:25.200 --> 29:33.200]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[29:33.200 --> 29:36.200]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[29:36.200 --> 29:43.200]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[29:43.200 --> 29:50.200]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult,
[29:50.200 --> 29:52.200]  it's all about dominating your free will.
[29:52.200 --> 30:00.200]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[30:00.200 --> 30:08.200]  As you know, we're always upping our game at M4 Wars and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[30:08.200 --> 30:09.200]  It is down and out.
[30:09.200 --> 30:11.200]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[30:11.200 --> 30:14.200]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[30:14.200 --> 30:17.200]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[30:17.200 --> 30:19.200]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[30:19.200 --> 30:23.200]  It's got 50 milligrams of Valerian root extract concentrate.
[30:23.200 --> 30:28.200]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[30:28.200 --> 30:31.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[30:31.200 --> 30:34.200]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[30:34.200 --> 30:36.200]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[30:36.200 --> 30:40.200]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[30:40.200 --> 30:41.200]  It's incredible.
[30:41.200 --> 30:43.200]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[30:43.200 --> 30:46.200]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[31:24.200 --> 31:27.200]  What's going to happen in mass movements?
[31:27.200 --> 31:33.200]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[31:33.200 --> 31:35.200]  In their own words, they admit it.
[31:35.200 --> 31:40.200]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[31:40.200 --> 31:42.200]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[31:42.200 --> 31:43.200]  They're Faraday cages.
[31:43.200 --> 31:45.200]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[31:45.200 --> 31:47.200]  They work absolutely great.
[31:47.200 --> 31:56.200]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business.
[31:56.200 --> 32:00.200]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[32:00.200 --> 32:04.200]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[32:04.200 --> 32:07.200]  They figured out the globalist are literally trying to kill us.
[32:07.200 --> 32:12.200]  They're trying to take over civilization and society and they depend on the public being ignorant.
[32:12.200 --> 32:16.200]  That's why Jesus said my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[32:16.200 --> 32:25.200]  Knowledge is power like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[32:25.200 --> 32:31.200]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[32:31.200 --> 32:40.200]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[32:40.200 --> 32:42.200]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.

[32:53.200 --> 32:55.200]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.

[33:23.200 --> 33:30.200]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[33:30.200 --> 33:34.200]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[33:34.200 --> 33:41.200]  All right, let me bear down and focus on the latest vaccine news and the Marvin Hagler story.
[33:41.200 --> 33:46.200]  So let me just, again, revert to the big news from last week.
[33:46.200 --> 33:54.200]  We've seen this where Anthony Fauci admits in a live interview that this is not a vaccine.
[33:54.200 --> 33:57.200]  This is experimental mRNA gene therapy.
[33:57.200 --> 33:59.200]  It's never been tested.
[33:59.200 --> 34:03.200]  I mean, he said, he's like, the good news is so far it's not been so bad.
[34:03.200 --> 34:14.200]  The good news is, well, pretty bad for Hank Aaron and his family, pretty bad for the nurse in Las Vegas and everywhere else and all the people that have died from it.
[34:14.200 --> 34:17.200]  So, you know, it kind of sucks for them, though, but for Fauci, it's been good.
[34:17.200 --> 34:23.200]  I mean, the numbers are pretty good for a worldwide human experiment with a brand new technology, only thousands dead.
[34:23.200 --> 34:24.200]  That's not bad.
[34:24.200 --> 34:25.200]  That's not bad.
[34:25.200 --> 34:31.200]  Sure, we rebranded the flu as fear porn for COVID to put you in fear.
[34:31.200 --> 34:32.200]  But you know what?
[34:32.200 --> 34:34.200]  Only thousands of you have died.
[34:34.200 --> 34:35.200]  So it's not so bad.
[34:35.200 --> 34:36.200]  It's pretty good.
[34:36.200 --> 34:38.200]  And he says it all in the interview.
[34:38.200 --> 34:39.200]  It's shocking.
[34:39.200 --> 34:43.200]  It's like, if you take what he says at face value, I mean, he just admitted all of it.
[34:43.200 --> 34:44.200]  It doesn't make headlines.
[34:44.200 --> 34:45.200]  Nobody blinks an eye.
[34:45.200 --> 34:47.200]  It's whatever.
[34:47.200 --> 34:49.200]  So Fauci admits it's experimental.
[34:49.200 --> 34:54.200]  He admits it's also not even effective because you get the vaccine, you still have to wear the mask.
[34:54.200 --> 34:55.200]  You still have to socially distance.
[34:55.200 --> 34:59.200]  You still can't go to school and church because they don't know it's in a trial phase.
[34:59.200 --> 35:00.200]  They don't know.
[35:00.200 --> 35:01.200]  Maybe you can still spread it.
[35:01.200 --> 35:02.200]  Maybe you can still get it.
[35:02.200 --> 35:03.200]  Maybe you can still die from it.
[35:03.200 --> 35:04.200]  Maybe it'll be worse when you get it.
[35:04.200 --> 35:05.200]  They don't know.
[35:05.200 --> 35:06.200]  It's all being tested right now.
[35:06.200 --> 35:07.200]  And he admits it.
[35:07.200 --> 35:10.200]  But see, he's so arrogant.
[35:10.200 --> 35:17.200]  He's such a medical tyrant that he's disturbed that Trump voters are skeptical of taking the
[35:17.200 --> 35:18.200]  vaccine and don't want to.
[35:18.200 --> 35:22.200]  And he's urging Trump to tell his supporters to take the vaccine.
[35:22.200 --> 35:25.200]  That's not going to go well.
[35:25.200 --> 35:27.200]  And Trump's not going to do it.
[35:27.200 --> 35:33.200]  At least, I hope, be a bad move politically.
[35:33.200 --> 35:38.200]  You'd think it'd be a bad move, you know, just across the board politically to say, hey,
[35:38.200 --> 35:41.200]  I'm introducing medical tyranny, big pharma tyranny.
[35:41.200 --> 35:44.200]  You have to take this big pharmaceutical product.
[35:44.200 --> 35:46.200]  You have to consume it.
[35:46.200 --> 35:47.200]  It's freedom.
[35:47.200 --> 35:50.200]  Or if you want to be free again, just do as I say.
[35:50.200 --> 35:51.200]  That's freedom, folks.
[35:51.200 --> 35:52.200]  Don't you know?
[35:52.200 --> 35:57.200]  Freedom in the 21st century under Fauci and Gates and Biden.
[35:57.200 --> 36:00.200]  Do what I say and you can be free.
[36:00.200 --> 36:03.200]  Oh, that's nice.
[36:03.200 --> 36:17.200]  So now Marvin Hagler, marvelous Marvin Hagler, a world famous boxer, champion boxer, gets
[36:17.200 --> 36:22.200]  the vaccine hours later in the ICU fighting the side effects.
[36:22.200 --> 36:28.200]  And it ends up being Thomas Hearns, who was a famous boxer as well back in the day, a
[36:28.200 --> 36:38.200]  champion boxer in his own right, said Hagler's in ICU fighting the side effects of the vaccine.
[36:38.200 --> 36:42.200]  And then of course, Marvin Hagler dies.
[36:42.200 --> 36:45.200]  And so the media has to rush.
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.200]  The media owned by a big pharma has to rush to cover this up.
[36:50.200 --> 36:53.200]  Has to rush to set the narrative straight.
[36:53.200 --> 36:55.200]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[36:55.200 --> 36:58.200]  Don't you mention that he took the vaccine.
[36:58.200 --> 37:00.200]  That's in bad taste.
[37:00.200 --> 37:04.200]  Don't you dare mention that somebody gets shot in Denver, Colorado.
[37:04.200 --> 37:06.200]  Somebody gets run over in New York.
[37:06.200 --> 37:11.200]  They died of COVID, but you don't dare mention that Hagler got the vaccine hours before he
[37:11.200 --> 37:12.200]  died.
[37:12.200 --> 37:14.200]  You don't dare bring that up.
[37:14.200 --> 37:18.200]  Fauci's very upset with you.
[37:18.200 --> 37:20.200]  And then here come the headlines.
[37:20.200 --> 37:23.200]  Anti-vaxxers try to hijack.
[37:23.200 --> 37:25.200]  We're hijacking the death.
[37:25.200 --> 37:27.200]  I've hijacked his death, folks.
[37:27.200 --> 37:28.200]  I'm hijacked and I stole it.
[37:28.200 --> 37:29.200]  It's mine now.
[37:29.200 --> 37:30.200]  My death.
[37:30.200 --> 37:33.200]  No, Marvin Hagler died from the vaccine.
[37:33.200 --> 37:35.200]  That's not me hijacking the death.
[37:35.200 --> 37:38.200]  That's the new world order hijacking his life.
[37:38.200 --> 37:41.200]  That's the new world order hijacking him and killing him.
[37:41.200 --> 37:47.200]  But it's all a global population control agenda.
[37:47.200 --> 37:51.200]  Anti-vaxxers try to hijack the death of boxing legend Martin Hagler.
[37:51.200 --> 37:54.200]  Falsely claiming he died from vaccine side effects.
[37:54.200 --> 37:55.200]  Falsely claiming.
[37:55.200 --> 37:57.200]  How do you know?
[37:57.200 --> 37:59.200]  You don't know.
[37:59.200 --> 38:01.200]  You're owned by big pharmaceutical.
[38:01.200 --> 38:04.200]  You are paid fake news.
[38:04.200 --> 38:06.200]  You're scum.
[38:06.200 --> 38:15.200]  We, you can't, we, you falsely claiming, falsely claiming, but you don't know.
[38:15.200 --> 38:18.200]  And I mean, the crazy thing is like they interview his family.
[38:18.200 --> 38:22.200]  They talk to herns and they're like, yeah, you just got the vaccine and immediately died.
[38:22.200 --> 38:24.200]  Like, yeah, this was out of nowhere.
[38:24.200 --> 38:25.200]  We had no idea.
[38:25.200 --> 38:26.200]  Oh, he was in great health.
[38:26.200 --> 38:28.200]  This was so unexpected.
[38:28.200 --> 38:30.200]  So what was the difference?
[38:30.200 --> 38:32.200]  What was the variable?
[38:32.200 --> 38:33.200]  The vaccine.
[38:33.200 --> 38:43.200]  Well, hey, look, listen, we got a global extermination thing going here.
[38:43.200 --> 38:49.200]  And we got this new trial biotechnology that we want to test on humans before we give ourselves the real stuff.
[38:49.200 --> 38:53.200]  And so, you know, maybe just not mentioned the vaccine.
[38:53.200 --> 38:58.200]  Just don't even, you know, I mean, just don't publish any headlines about that either.
[38:58.200 --> 39:01.200]  And if you do, just attack the people that would even mention the vaccine.
[39:01.200 --> 39:06.200]  And please don't bring up that he got the vaccine hours before he died either.
[39:06.200 --> 39:08.200]  Don't, you don't want to do that.
[39:08.200 --> 39:13.200]  We're running a very, very important worldwide experiment right now on you.
[39:13.200 --> 39:16.200]  So you just don't want to mention that vaccine.
[39:16.200 --> 39:17.200]  All right.
[39:17.200 --> 39:19.200]  It's just not a good idea for you.
[39:19.200 --> 39:24.200]  So he didn't die of the vaccine, even though we don't know what he died of.
[39:24.200 --> 39:27.200]  And it was all very suspicious right after the vaccine and unexpected.
[39:27.200 --> 39:29.200]  But do not mention that vaccine.
[39:29.200 --> 39:30.200]  You can't do it.
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.200]  And if you do, you're hijacking his death.
[39:34.200 --> 39:38.200]  Even though you hijacked his life when you killed him with the vaccine.
[39:38.200 --> 39:43.200]  And so here's the amazing thing because I don't know if my dad had heard about
[39:43.200 --> 39:46.200]  Marvin Hagler's death, but he, but he tuned in today and he's like, oh,
[39:46.200 --> 39:52.200]  Marvin Hagler, I was a big fan of him back in boxing's heyday.
[39:52.200 --> 39:55.200]  And I said, yeah, they got him with the vaccine.
[39:55.200 --> 40:00.200]  And he responded and he said, no, they got him with the propaganda first.
[40:00.200 --> 40:04.200]  And that is so key to all of this.
[40:04.200 --> 40:09.200]  That's why info wars is on air, folks.
[40:09.200 --> 40:12.200]  That's like the sword that we wield.
[40:12.200 --> 40:15.200]  That's like the ultimate burden.
[40:15.200 --> 40:18.200]  We don't want you to fall for the propaganda to be afraid of COVID.
[40:18.200 --> 40:22.200]  We don't want you to fall for the propaganda to be afraid of the flu.
[40:22.200 --> 40:25.200]  We don't want you to fall for the propaganda to go out there and take a
[40:25.200 --> 40:30.200]  potentially deadly, uh, never been tested on humans before.
[40:30.200 --> 40:35.200]  DNA, DNA modification therapy vaccine.
[40:35.200 --> 40:38.200]  So, so we're combating their propaganda and that's the battle.
[40:38.200 --> 40:43.200]  Hey, we're wielding our sword of truth versus the sword of the corrupt
[40:43.200 --> 40:46.200]  deep state secret government, whatever you want to call it mainstream news.
[40:46.200 --> 40:48.200]  Well, they got Hagler.
[40:48.200 --> 40:49.200]  They won that battle.
[40:49.200 --> 40:54.200]  And now Hagler's soul hopefully is in heaven with the creator.
[40:54.200 --> 40:57.200]  But so, see, this is the propaganda.
[40:57.200 --> 40:58.200]  Oh, Obama took the shot.
[40:58.200 --> 41:00.200]  George Bush took the shot.
[41:00.200 --> 41:02.200]  Don't you know all your famous celebs took the shot?
[41:02.200 --> 41:05.200]  Of course, they're probably not actually getting the shot.
[41:05.200 --> 41:10.200]  It's probably a fake shot or like a, I forget where it was.
[41:10.200 --> 41:11.200]  It was some hospital.
[41:11.200 --> 41:12.200]  So I was like, okay, fine.
[41:12.200 --> 41:13.200]  We'll, we'll force all our people to get a shot.
[41:13.200 --> 41:15.200]  And then they just gave them nothing.
[41:15.200 --> 41:16.200]  It was fake.
[41:16.200 --> 41:17.200]  They admitted it.
[41:17.200 --> 41:18.200]  They're like, yeah, we faked giving them the shot.
[41:18.200 --> 41:19.200]  We don't actually want them to take the shot.
[41:19.200 --> 41:20.200]  It's deadly.
[41:20.200 --> 41:22.200]  But see, there's the propaganda.
[41:22.200 --> 41:24.200]  Oh, be afraid of COVID.
[41:24.200 --> 41:25.200]  Be deathly afraid of COVID.
[41:25.200 --> 41:26.200]  It's the deadliest thing ever.
[41:26.200 --> 41:28.200]  Oh boy, I'm really afraid of COVID.
[41:28.200 --> 41:30.200]  Then they crash your economy.
[41:30.200 --> 41:33.200]  And now that they have you in fear, in the grips of fear.
[41:33.200 --> 41:35.200]  See, look, that woman didn't even get a vaccine.
[41:35.200 --> 41:36.200]  It's all fake.
[41:36.200 --> 41:38.200]  They know the damn thing's deadly.
[41:38.200 --> 41:39.200]  There's nothing even in it.
[41:39.200 --> 41:41.200]  They don't even try to fake it good.
[41:41.200 --> 41:43.200]  They think you're that stupid.
[41:43.200 --> 41:47.200]  And for most sadly, for most people, they are not you in this audience,
[41:47.200 --> 41:52.200]  obviously, but.
[41:52.200 --> 41:53.200]  So.
[41:53.200 --> 41:56.200]  You see how it works.
[41:56.200 --> 41:57.200]  It's true though.
[41:57.200 --> 41:58.200]  They hit.
[41:58.200 --> 42:00.200]  They hit you with the propaganda first.
[42:00.200 --> 42:02.200]  And then once you accept it.
[42:02.200 --> 42:07.200]  Once you consume it, then you'll do anything they want.
[42:07.200 --> 42:09.200]  You'll do a swab up your nose.
[42:09.200 --> 42:11.200]  You'll do a swab up your butt.
[42:11.200 --> 42:15.200]  Just to see if you got COVID.
[42:15.200 --> 42:19.200]  Which is 99.99999% survivable.
[42:19.200 --> 42:21.200]  So the big lie that, oh, it's going to kill you if you get it.
[42:21.200 --> 42:22.200]  That was a big lie.
[42:22.200 --> 42:23.200]  That doesn't matter now.
[42:23.200 --> 42:27.200]  The big lie of all these cases, it turns out the tests were fraudulent.
[42:27.200 --> 42:29.200]  No, that doesn't matter now.
[42:29.200 --> 42:32.200]  The big lives, the deadliest pandemic ever.
[42:32.200 --> 42:34.200]  Death rate didn't go up a single percent.
[42:34.200 --> 42:35.200]  Now the big lie.
[42:35.200 --> 42:38.200]  After they sold you that big lie and you bought that big lie.
[42:38.200 --> 42:40.200]  Now the big lie is the vaccine is safe and effective.
[42:40.200 --> 42:41.200]  Nope.
[42:41.200 --> 42:42.200]  It's killing thousands of people.
[42:42.200 --> 42:43.200]  Even admit it.
[42:43.200 --> 42:45.200]  That's just what we know of.
[42:45.200 --> 42:47.200]  That it's killing thousands of people.
[42:47.200 --> 42:48.200]  So that's the next big lie.
[42:48.200 --> 42:50.200]  So that's why InfoWars is here.
[42:50.200 --> 42:52.200]  To fight that propaganda.
[42:52.200 --> 42:55.200]  I would not get that vaccine, folks.
[42:55.200 --> 42:59.200]  And I would never live in fear of a TV media narrative.
[42:59.200 --> 43:04.200]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[43:04.200 --> 43:05.200]  People ask me all the time.
[43:05.200 --> 43:06.200]  They go, Joe, are you on cocaine?
[43:06.200 --> 43:07.200]  Are you on meth?
[43:07.200 --> 43:08.200]  How are you so excited?
[43:08.200 --> 43:11.200]  How do I not get excited about world government?
[43:11.200 --> 43:13.200]  Forced masks.
[43:13.200 --> 43:14.200]  Forced inoculations.
[43:14.200 --> 43:17.200]  Open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved.
[43:17.200 --> 43:18.200]  I'm sorry.
[43:18.200 --> 43:19.200]  I'm a fighter.
[43:19.200 --> 43:22.200]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[43:22.200 --> 43:24.200]  And so I'll just say this.
[43:24.200 --> 43:25.200]  I try to be calm.
[43:25.200 --> 43:27.200]  I try to be focused.
[43:27.200 --> 43:30.200]  I don't know what I do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[43:30.200 --> 43:34.200]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[43:34.200 --> 43:39.200]  Because you have to realize when I tell you that you're the InfoWars, that's not me patting you on the head.
[43:39.200 --> 43:43.200]  You are 99% of the equation.
[43:43.200 --> 43:46.200]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products,
[43:46.200 --> 43:51.200]  InfoWarsTour.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[43:51.200 --> 43:53.200]  So you are the InfoWars.
[43:53.200 --> 43:55.200]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[43:55.200 --> 43:56.200]  Thank you for all you've done.
[43:56.200 --> 43:59.200]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalist.
[43:59.200 --> 44:03.200]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[44:03.200 --> 44:06.200]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[44:06.200 --> 44:07.200]  Why do you do that?
[44:07.200 --> 44:10.200]  It does different strokes for different folks.
[44:10.200 --> 44:12.200]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say,
[44:12.200 --> 44:15.200]  hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine,
[44:15.200 --> 44:18.200]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types,
[44:18.200 --> 44:21.200]  because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[44:21.200 --> 44:22.200]  Boom, we did it.
[44:22.200 --> 44:23.200]  It's popular.
[44:23.200 --> 44:24.200]  It's X3.
[44:24.200 --> 44:25.200]  Is it better than X2?
[44:25.200 --> 44:26.200]  You decide.
[44:26.200 --> 44:27.200]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[44:27.200 --> 44:32.200]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[44:32.200 --> 44:34.200]  And that is down and out.
[44:34.200 --> 44:37.200]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out,
[44:37.200 --> 44:38.200]  but they don't compete with each other.
[44:38.200 --> 44:41.200]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas,
[44:41.200 --> 44:45.200]  and it's 40% off out of the gates at mforestore.com and free shipping.
[44:45.200 --> 44:48.200]  Secure your down and out today, and while you're sleeping,
[44:48.200 --> 44:50.200]  you know you're funding the M4 at the same time.
[44:50.200 --> 44:54.200]  Down and out, exclusively available at mforestore.com and 40% off and free shipping.
[45:00.200 --> 45:02.200]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[45:02.200 --> 45:04.200]  It's very bittersweet.
[45:04.200 --> 45:07.200]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[45:07.200 --> 45:09.200]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[45:09.200 --> 45:11.200]  I care about beating the new world order.
[45:11.200 --> 45:13.200]  And it's because we have so much credibility,
[45:13.200 --> 45:16.200]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[45:16.200 --> 45:18.200]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[45:18.200 --> 45:21.200]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[45:21.200 --> 45:22.200]  But let's just say this.
[45:22.200 --> 45:24.200]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[45:24.200 --> 45:26.200]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[45:26.200 --> 45:30.200]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mforestore.com.
[45:30.200 --> 45:31.200]  They're great products.
[45:31.200 --> 45:33.200]  Plus, they fund the operation.
[45:33.200 --> 45:36.200]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[45:36.200 --> 45:37.200]  Do they fund freedom?
[45:37.200 --> 45:38.200]  No, a lot of them don't.
[45:38.200 --> 45:41.200]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[45:41.200 --> 45:44.200]  when the whole world is waking up and looking for truth.
[45:44.200 --> 45:46.200]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[45:46.200 --> 45:49.200]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air.
[45:49.200 --> 45:52.200]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[45:52.200 --> 45:55.200]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it
[45:55.200 --> 45:57.200]  because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[45:57.200 --> 46:00.200]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[46:00.200 --> 46:04.200]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[46:04.200 --> 46:08.200]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[46:08.200 --> 46:11.200]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists,
[46:11.200 --> 46:14.200]  you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta
[46:14.200 --> 46:17.200]  and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[46:17.200 --> 46:20.200]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid,
[46:20.200 --> 46:22.200]  they are now making that move.
[46:22.200 --> 46:25.200]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons
[46:25.200 --> 46:30.200]  to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon
[46:30.200 --> 46:33.200]  to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[46:33.200 --> 46:36.200]  capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign,
[46:36.200 --> 46:40.200]  hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[46:40.200 --> 46:45.200]  not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab were saying
[46:45.200 --> 46:49.200]  and Bill Gates was saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns
[46:49.200 --> 46:52.200]  that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute
[46:52.200 --> 46:56.200]  are they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[46:56.200 --> 47:25.200]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[47:26.200 --> 47:29.200]  Stop tyranny, well so does he.
[47:29.200 --> 47:34.200]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:34.200 --> 47:39.200]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[47:39.200 --> 47:47.200]  So, in Texas last week, the governor of Texas
[47:47.200 --> 47:52.200]  revoked a mandate that he never had the legal right to enforce
[47:52.200 --> 47:56.200]  anybody to enforce anyway of forcing you to wear a face mask
[47:56.200 --> 47:59.200]  and breathe in your own carbon dioxide emissions.
[47:59.200 --> 48:03.200]  Totally unhealthy, plus the mask spreads disease, but I digress.
[48:03.200 --> 48:10.200]  So, it's been a bit of a bugaboo here in town with the mask thing
[48:10.200 --> 48:13.200]  and specifically across the state of Texas.
[48:13.200 --> 48:17.200]  And so, you have a woman that was arrested
[48:17.200 --> 48:20.200]  because she refused to wear a mask at a bank of America.
[48:20.200 --> 48:23.200]  So, now it's just become the globalist corporations
[48:23.200 --> 48:27.200]  enforcing the corporate government versus the actual will
[48:27.200 --> 48:29.200]  of you, the individual, the sovereign citizen,
[48:29.200 --> 48:32.200]  or even the will now of your local government.
[48:32.200 --> 48:36.200]  So, this is the introduction of the corporate government.
[48:36.200 --> 48:40.200]  The same people own everything and they are forcing you to wear a mask.
[48:40.200 --> 48:42.200]  They were behind the fake pandemic, they own the media,
[48:42.200 --> 48:45.200]  and now they own all the corporations.
[48:45.200 --> 48:47.200]  So, they're going to force you to wear a mask.
[48:47.200 --> 48:50.200]  So, now you have to find out where you can go in town
[48:50.200 --> 48:54.200]  that's not going to make you wear the face diaper and muzzle you
[48:54.200 --> 48:57.200]  and let you breathe clean air or at least have the option.
[48:57.200 --> 49:00.200]  And so, here is the report from Galveston, Texas
[49:00.200 --> 49:03.200]  where a nice lady refuses to wear a face mask,
[49:03.200 --> 49:08.200]  stands up herself, and then gets arrested on the ground by police.
[49:08.200 --> 49:10.200]  Our Vinzik Ravelli is live on the island tonight
[49:10.200 --> 49:13.200]  where an arrest warrant has been filed for a woman
[49:13.200 --> 49:17.200]  after she refused to wear a mask inside of a bank.
[49:17.200 --> 49:20.200]  This is one of the most pathetic things
[49:20.200 --> 49:22.200]  about the media here locally in Texas.
[49:22.200 --> 49:24.200]  Put that screen back up, guys.
[49:24.200 --> 49:26.200]  They love promoting the mask.
[49:26.200 --> 49:28.200]  I don't get it.
[49:28.200 --> 49:30.200]  I really don't get it.
[49:30.200 --> 49:32.200]  And here's what it comes down to.
[49:32.200 --> 49:35.200]  It used to be that street reporters and journalists,
[49:35.200 --> 49:38.200]  they used to be, they like to get their hands dirty.
[49:38.200 --> 49:41.200]  They like to go against the grain.
[49:41.200 --> 49:43.200]  That was kind of what separated them.
[49:43.200 --> 49:45.200]  They were rebellious in a way.
[49:45.200 --> 49:50.200]  Now it's the most conformist industry in the world
[49:50.200 --> 49:52.200]  is being a media reporter.
[49:52.200 --> 49:54.200]  That's why InfoWars stands out above the rest
[49:54.200 --> 49:56.200]  because we're the least conformist.
[49:56.200 --> 49:58.200]  When everyone else is a total conformist,
[49:58.200 --> 49:59.200]  we're the exact opposite.
[49:59.200 --> 50:02.200]  So you'll notice all the local news stations here in Austin
[50:02.200 --> 50:04.200]  and in Texas, they love the mask.
[50:04.200 --> 50:06.200]  They love promoting COVID.
[50:06.200 --> 50:08.200]  It's their number one story every night.
[50:08.200 --> 50:11.200]  They have the mask in their logo.
[50:11.200 --> 50:13.200]  Put it back on screen.
[50:13.200 --> 50:16.200]  The mask is in their logo.
[50:16.200 --> 50:18.200]  How pathetic is that?
[50:18.200 --> 50:20.200]  So let's go back to the report.
[50:20.200 --> 50:23.200]  Yeah, Christy, we spoke with a woman at the center of all this.
[50:23.200 --> 50:26.200]  But first, I want to show you guys the compelling body camera footage
[50:26.200 --> 50:28.200]  of the incidents.
[50:28.200 --> 50:29.200]  Compelling.
[50:29.200 --> 50:31.200]  A woman dares to be free.
[50:31.200 --> 50:33.200]  People, this is what they do to you.
[50:33.200 --> 50:37.200]  Detectives say yesterday 65-year-old Terry Wright
[50:37.200 --> 50:39.200]  had to wear a mask inside of a Bank of America
[50:39.200 --> 50:41.200]  that requires one.
[50:41.200 --> 50:43.200]  This is how the situation ended.
[50:43.200 --> 50:45.200]  Let's go back to where things started.
[50:45.200 --> 50:47.200]  If that's too late, you have to leave.
[50:47.200 --> 50:49.200]  That's a police officer talking.
[50:49.200 --> 50:51.200]  My money's in the bank, and I'm going to take it out.
[50:51.200 --> 50:53.200]  Then the pair argued over whether the bank
[50:53.200 --> 50:55.200]  was a private or public place.
[50:55.200 --> 50:57.200]  Wright claimed it was public,
[50:57.200 --> 50:59.200]  and she didn't have to wear a mask.
[50:59.200 --> 51:02.200]  Ma'am, listen, we're going to do this the easy way or the hard way.
[51:02.200 --> 51:03.200]  What are you going to do?
[51:03.200 --> 51:04.200]  Arrest me?
[51:04.200 --> 51:06.200]  Yes, for intruding on premises.
[51:06.200 --> 51:08.200]  Let's fast forward a couple seconds.
[51:08.200 --> 51:11.200]  Now the officer is telling Wright he wants her to go outside
[51:11.200 --> 51:13.200]  and pulls out his handcuffs.
[51:13.200 --> 51:15.200]  That's when things escalated.
[51:15.200 --> 51:16.200]  Now, touch me.
[51:16.200 --> 51:17.200]  Who do you think you are?
[51:17.200 --> 51:18.200]  It's my time.
[51:18.200 --> 51:19.200]  Oh, back up, back up.
[51:19.200 --> 51:22.200]  Some old lady is getting handcuffed here.
[51:24.200 --> 51:26.200]  Now, pause it.
[51:26.200 --> 51:28.200]  So she's trying to leave the building.
[51:28.200 --> 51:29.200]  She's cooperative. She's nice.
[51:29.200 --> 51:31.200]  Oh, by the way, it's such a deadly pandemic.
[51:31.200 --> 51:32.200]  I'd go back to the video.
[51:32.200 --> 51:33.200]  It's such a deadly pandemic.
[51:33.200 --> 51:35.200]  You know, six feet of social distance, wear the mask.
[51:35.200 --> 51:40.200]  The officer has no problem mauling her, mauling her in this bank of America.
[51:40.200 --> 51:42.200]  Oh, what happened to social distance?
[51:42.200 --> 51:43.200]  She doesn't have a mask.
[51:43.200 --> 51:44.200]  Are you going to die from COVID?
[51:44.200 --> 51:46.200]  No, it's all fake, but you still enforce the law anyway.
[51:46.200 --> 51:50.200]  So it's going to be real tough to do back the blue the more you see this
[51:50.200 --> 51:52.200]  because this is pathetic.
[51:52.200 --> 51:54.200]  This officer is pathetic.
[51:54.200 --> 52:00.200]  What a sad excuse for a man arresting a 65-year-old lady
[52:00.200 --> 52:04.200]  because she dares speaks the truth and live her own life.
[52:04.200 --> 52:06.200]  So guys, go back to the point where she's getting arrested.
[52:06.200 --> 52:08.200]  And she's in there. She's in there telling the people,
[52:08.200 --> 52:09.200]  like, hey, the mask is stupid.
[52:09.200 --> 52:10.200]  Why are we doing this? Take your mask off.
[52:10.200 --> 52:13.200]  And look at the pathetic American standing there,
[52:13.200 --> 52:18.200]  letting this woman be harassed by a police officer.
[52:18.200 --> 52:21.200]  Pathetic. This is just such a pathetic display on so many levels.
[52:21.200 --> 52:22.200]  Go back to the report.
[52:22.200 --> 52:25.200]  With one hand behind her back, she had more fights.
[52:25.200 --> 52:26.200]  Stop resisting. Stop.
[52:26.200 --> 52:30.200]  Eventually, she did stop and became compliant.
[52:30.200 --> 52:31.200]  Are you going to make more favor?
[52:31.200 --> 52:34.200]  That's when things got a little weird.
[52:34.200 --> 52:35.200]  Are you trying to speak Spanish to people?
[52:35.200 --> 52:36.200]  I do speak Spanish.
[52:36.200 --> 52:37.200]  Okay, we'll stand up.
[52:37.200 --> 52:41.200]  And she did stand up and was taken away in a cop car.
[52:41.200 --> 52:44.200]  I think wearing a mask is absolutely ridiculous.
[52:44.200 --> 52:46.200]  So I don't know why people aren't waking up.
[52:46.200 --> 52:49.200]  I really don't. It's a pandemic.
[52:49.200 --> 52:50.200]  That's Terry Wright.
[52:50.200 --> 52:52.200]  She's voicing her side of the story.
[52:52.200 --> 52:54.200]  My civil rights were violated.
[52:54.200 --> 52:59.200]  I do not. There is no law that says I have to wear a mask.
[52:59.200 --> 53:00.200]  None whatsoever.
[53:00.200 --> 53:02.200]  Ah, but there's a case for government, see.
[53:02.200 --> 53:04.200]  They don't have to write laws.
[53:04.200 --> 53:06.200]  They rule by fiat, by dictate.
[53:06.200 --> 53:09.200]  Excuse me, access, unless I put a face diaper on.
[53:09.200 --> 53:11.200]  Behind your back.
[53:11.200 --> 53:14.200]  And Wright went on to say that every bone in her body now hurts.
[53:14.200 --> 53:16.200]  Again, Wright has not been arrested.
[53:16.200 --> 53:19.200]  However, arrest warrants have been filed.
[53:19.200 --> 53:23.200]  Wow. We got her.
[53:23.200 --> 53:25.200]  We did it. We did it. Protect and serve.
[53:25.200 --> 53:28.200]  All right.
[53:28.200 --> 53:33.200]  Six feet social distance, but I'm all you onto the ground in a bank of America.
[53:33.200 --> 53:39.200]  So Terry Lynn Wright is an American treasure and an American hero.
[53:39.200 --> 53:41.200]  And she'll probably go to jail for it.
[53:41.200 --> 53:46.200]  She'll probably get demonized, fired from her job if she has one.
[53:46.200 --> 53:49.200]  Tormented by local media.
[53:49.200 --> 53:57.200]  And notice how not a single person stands up to her defense and they just let this cop manhandle this 65 year old lady.
[53:57.200 --> 54:00.200]  These people are pathetic.
[54:00.200 --> 54:02.200]  And so this is the strangest part.
[54:02.200 --> 54:05.200]  You know, this is one of the stranger things about living in the world.
[54:05.200 --> 54:07.200]  You think you're walking around with fellow humans.
[54:07.200 --> 54:10.200]  You're not.
[54:10.200 --> 54:12.200]  You're not.
[54:12.200 --> 54:18.200]  You are outnumbered by the brainwashed alien zombie hordes.
[54:18.200 --> 54:21.200]  And it's events like this.
[54:21.200 --> 54:24.200]  It display that sad reality.
[54:24.200 --> 54:32.200]  You have about 10 people in that bank and you have workers and the security guard and not a single person comes to this woman's defense.
[54:32.200 --> 54:35.200]  Not a one, not a one.
[54:35.200 --> 54:37.200]  Talk about customer service.
[54:37.200 --> 54:41.200]  Nobody can even step up and say, hey, can we just, can we let this lady leave in peace, please?
[54:41.200 --> 54:43.200]  Nope, they can't even do that.
[54:43.200 --> 54:44.200]  And don't you love this?
[54:44.200 --> 54:47.200]  They have, there's your social distance on the floor.
[54:47.200 --> 54:53.200]  They've got that little social distance marker on the floor as the cop is manhandling this lady.
[54:53.200 --> 55:00.200]  And no social distance, no gloves on his hand, just grabbing her up and down, pummeling her.
[55:00.200 --> 55:02.200]  It just shows how the whole thing is theater, folks.
[55:02.200 --> 55:04.200]  The entire thing is political theater.
[55:04.200 --> 55:09.200]  And it's being used to take away our freedoms and conquer us.
[55:09.200 --> 55:14.200]  And not a single person dares stand up against it.
[55:14.200 --> 55:18.200]  And you know, this is what I say to people now.
[55:18.200 --> 55:20.200]  Oh yeah, I don't want to enforce the mask.
[55:20.200 --> 55:22.200]  Oh, okay, I'm just doing my job.
[55:22.200 --> 55:25.200]  You know, there's a famous political movement.
[55:25.200 --> 55:28.200]  There's a historical group of people that that was the excuse.
[55:28.200 --> 55:29.200]  What am I thinking of here?
[55:29.200 --> 55:30.200]  Oh, I'm just doing my job.
[55:30.200 --> 55:31.200]  I'm just doing my job.
[55:31.200 --> 55:32.200]  How do we get to that point?
[55:32.200 --> 55:33.200]  Oh, I'm just doing my job.
[55:33.200 --> 55:34.200]  What was the name of them?
[55:34.200 --> 55:35.200]  I can't, I can't quite put it.
[55:35.200 --> 55:37.200]  But there was some group out there and that was the excuse.
[55:37.200 --> 55:38.200]  I was just doing my job.
[55:38.200 --> 55:39.200]  How could I get that bad?
[55:39.200 --> 55:40.200]  They were just doing their job.
[55:40.200 --> 55:42.200]  And then they figure out what you're talking about.
[55:42.200 --> 55:46.200]  Obviously the Nazis, and these people are behaving like Nazis.
[55:46.200 --> 55:50.200]  When you throw a 65-year-old woman into a cop car because she doesn't want to wear a mask.
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.200]  Oh, and she's supposedly the most at-risk individual.
[55:55.200 --> 56:00.200]  Yeah, it's a rude awakening being in a position like that.
[56:00.200 --> 56:05.200]  And having to realize in live time you're one of the last humans remaining on Earth.
[56:05.200 --> 56:07.200]  Everyone else is a mind slave.
[56:07.200 --> 56:11.200]  Everyone else is a walking zombie slave.
[56:11.200 --> 56:17.200]  And your desire to be free, your desire to live in reality does not resonate with your fellow humans.
[56:17.200 --> 56:20.200]  They are gone.
[56:20.200 --> 56:24.200]  So, yeah, it's not a pleasant thing to try to be free in America anymore.
[56:24.200 --> 56:25.200]  You are now the most disc-
[56:25.200 --> 56:30.200]  Free thinkers are the most discriminated group of people in the United States of America today.
[56:30.200 --> 56:37.200]  Free thinkers are the most discriminated and hated group of people in the United States today.
[56:37.200 --> 56:41.200]  And it's videos like that that prove it.
[56:41.200 --> 56:43.200]  And this is going worldwide.
[56:43.200 --> 56:47.200]  Again, another example, headline from the Daily Mail.
[56:47.200 --> 56:52.200]  Ranting customer brand sandwich shop staff Nazis after they ask him to wear a face mask.
[56:52.200 --> 56:53.200]  You're all Nazis.
[56:53.200 --> 56:54.200]  He screams.
[56:54.200 --> 56:58.200]  You're all traitors to your country as they tell him to wear a face mask.
[56:58.200 --> 57:02.200]  This was in Lee's Sandwich Shop in Oklahoma City.
[57:02.200 --> 57:03.200]  And it's the same thing.
[57:03.200 --> 57:04.200]  Everybody in there staring.
[57:04.200 --> 57:07.200]  By the way, there's no mask mandate in Oklahoma.
[57:07.200 --> 57:11.200]  Unless you're a service worker, I think is the thing now.
[57:11.200 --> 57:14.200]  But oh, see, he's in there saying, look at what they're doing.
[57:14.200 --> 57:15.200]  Nobody comes to his aid.
[57:15.200 --> 57:17.200]  Everyone bullies him, laughs at him.
[57:17.200 --> 57:21.200]  Again, you realize in that moment, you're one of the last humans alive.
[57:21.200 --> 57:24.200]  You are in zombie-osis land.
[57:24.200 --> 57:27.200]  You are in mind slave topia.
[57:27.200 --> 57:29.200]  You come out as a free thinker.
[57:29.200 --> 57:30.200]  You fight against this tyranny.
[57:30.200 --> 57:32.200]  You find that out real quick.
[57:32.200 --> 57:34.200]  Sidewalks way too crowded.
[57:34.200 --> 57:37.200]  Las Vegas Strip flooded with tourists as capacity limits eased.
[57:37.200 --> 57:39.200]  Yeah, the Austin Street were flooded with traffic.
[57:39.200 --> 57:41.200]  Thousands of people out drinking, nobody wearing masks.
[57:41.200 --> 57:43.200]  No spread.
[57:43.200 --> 57:45.200]  No spread, myself, none of my friends.
[57:45.200 --> 57:46.200]  We're all feeling fine today.
[57:46.200 --> 57:47.200]  The whole thing's fake.
[57:47.200 --> 57:49.200]  But don't be a good slave to it anyway.
[57:49.200 --> 57:53.200]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[57:53.200 --> 57:55.200]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years.
[57:55.200 --> 57:57.200]  And only the last year or so have I said that.
[57:57.200 --> 58:00.200]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[58:00.200 --> 58:02.200]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us.
[58:02.200 --> 58:04.200]  And they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[58:04.200 --> 58:07.200]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air.
[58:07.200 --> 58:10.200]  And please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[58:10.200 --> 58:14.200]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can.
[58:14.200 --> 58:15.200]  And get a book.
[58:15.200 --> 58:16.200]  Get a film.
[58:16.200 --> 58:17.200]  Get a t-shirt.
[58:17.200 --> 58:18.200]  Get some supplements.
[58:18.200 --> 58:22.200]  Because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[58:22.200 --> 58:25.200]  I need your help more than ever now.
[58:25.200 --> 58:26.200]  I want to keep fighting the globalists.
[58:26.200 --> 58:29.200]  But I can't do it if you don't support us.
[58:29.200 --> 58:30.200]  So pray for us.
[58:30.200 --> 58:31.200]  Word of mouth.
[58:31.200 --> 58:33.200]  Tell folks about the broadcast however you can.
[58:33.200 --> 58:39.200]  And buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[58:39.200 --> 58:43.200]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films.

[58:45.200 --> 58:46.200]  All of it empowers humanity.
[58:46.200 --> 58:49.200]  All of it is pro-human and pro-god.
[58:49.200 --> 58:50.200]  Thank you so much.
[58:50.200 --> 58:54.200]  As you know, we're always upping our game at Info Wars.

[59:00.200 --> 59:02.200]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[59:02.200 --> 59:05.200]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[59:05.200 --> 59:08.200]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[59:08.200 --> 59:10.200]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[59:10.200 --> 59:14.200]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[59:14.200 --> 59:16.200]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm.
[59:16.200 --> 59:19.200]  And 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[59:19.200 --> 59:22.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[59:22.200 --> 59:25.200]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[59:25.200 --> 59:27.200]  It's liquid, so it goes right into your body fast.
[59:27.200 --> 59:31.200]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off to sleep?
[59:31.200 --> 59:32.200]  It's incredible.
[59:32.200 --> 59:34.200]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[59:34.200 --> 59:37.200]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.
[59:37.200 --> 59:40.200]  Get yours today, down and out exclusively at InfoWareStore.com.

[59:44.200 --> 1:00:02.200]  Down and out, InfoWareStore.com.
[1:00:02.200 --> 1:00:20.200]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:29.200]  We have incredible amounts of left-wing terrorism, Democrat terrorism happening across the United States right now.
[1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:31.200]  Of course, it goes completely ignored by the media.
[1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:37.200]  They're still freaking out over the events of January 6th that didn't even stall the activities in Congress for more than five hours.
[1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:42.200]  They were back in Congress doing business even after the supposed insurrection.
[1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:44.200]  The big lie, that big lie.
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:47.200]  No lie too big for the Democrat Party and their media cohorts.
[1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:49.200]  They'll tell you any lie.
[1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:52.200]  So I would suggest not believing anything they say.
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:54.200]  You'll be much better off.
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:01:00.200]  But again, they still obsess over the events of January 6th where four Trump supporters died.
[1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:02.200]  One lady was executed, a military veteran.
[1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:11.200]  You still don't get to know the name of the officer that killed her or shot her in the head on tape, unarmed.
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:15.200]  And that's the worst thing that's ever happened and we have the Capitol locked down.
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:28.200]  By the way, the National Guard has requested that we remove all the National Guard and the walls and everything because it's on pace to cost us half a billion dollars a year right now at current rates in pace.
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:33.200]  And Pelosi and Lloyd Austin, the Secretary of Defense said no way.
[1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:36.200]  If anything, we're going to have more National Guard here.
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:39.200]  For what?
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:45.200]  Well, to protect the criminals in Congress, don't you see?
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:50.200]  This is what it really comes down to.
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:58.200]  Nancy Pelosi and the like know that you know they are the biggest criminals in the history of America.
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:05.200]  The most treasonous, traitorous actors in our country's history are in Congress right now.
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:08.200]  And they know that you know that.
[1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:17.200]  And so they got so scared that three straight months over a million people who know that showed up in D.C.
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:25.200]  And even though we were peaceful, it still scares them because they know at the flick of a switch that that could turn against them and we really could do.
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:27.200]  We could really, really could have taken Congress that day.
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:28.200]  They really could have taken the Capitol.
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:29.200]  That was never the plan.
[1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:30.200]  That was never the desire.
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:33.200]  That's why most people walking in looked confused and disoriented.
[1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:34.200]  We're walking around the ropes.
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:36.200]  They didn't know what they were doing.
[1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:45.200]  But see Pelosi and Schumer and Waters and Omar and the like know that you know they're the biggest criminals in the history of this country.
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:52.200]  They just robbed two trillion dollars once again, printing two trillion dollars to enrich themselves and build themselves out.
[1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:55.200]  So they need the wall at the Capitol.
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:03:00.200]  They need the National Guard at the Capitol because they need to protect themselves and their criminal behavior.
[1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:04.200]  It's mob psychology, but it's not mob.
[1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:07.200]  It's mafia psychology.
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:09.200]  You go to the big mafia Don's house.
[1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:10.200]  What does he have?
[1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:11.200]  He's got walls.
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:12.200]  He's got armed guards.
[1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:13.200]  He's behind it all.
[1:03:13.200 --> 1:03:19.200]  That's Congress now.
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:23.200]  But they don't seem to mind that Portland burns every night.
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:26.200]  They don't seem to mind that there's rioting in Los Angeles.
[1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:31.200]  They don't seem to mind that there's violence every night in Philadelphia in New York.
[1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:37.200]  The list just goes on.
[1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:41.200]  So what do you use that to say that the Democrats are total frauds and liars?
[1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:45.200]  Well, you already know that.
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:46.200]  But here's the problem.
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:49.200]  Most people don't even want to deal with this right now.
[1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:54.200]  And maybe that tide is starting to turn because it's getting so out of control.
[1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:56.200]  And I don't know how far ahead of the curve.
[1:03:56.200 --> 1:04:02.200]  Info wars is on this because we haven't reached that curve yet.
[1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:11.200]  But it's absolutely out of control what left wing Democrat terrorism is going on and being completely ignored by the mainstream media.
[1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:16.200]  They tried to burn a federal courthouse in Portland on Friday with people inside.
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:19.200]  Media didn't even mention it.
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:23.200]  But the FBI is still going after you.
[1:04:23.200 --> 1:04:30.200]  If you were in DC on January 6th, the FBI is still going after you.
[1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:40.200]  But in Portland, you had a Montana man who traveled to Portland, got involved in the Portland riots, he was arrested, got released and then got arrested again.
[1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:42.200]  Yeah.
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:45.200]  So I'm going to tell you all about it coming up.
[1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:54.200]  But the Democrat terror events continue to happen and the Democrat big lies continue to permeate the hearts and minds of Americans.
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:58.200]  And it needs to stop or we're in big trouble.
[1:04:58.200 --> 1:05:02.200]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:05.200]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:11.200]  They're trying to take over civilization and society and they depend on the public being ignorant.
[1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:14.200]  That's what Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[1:05:14.200 --> 1:05:16.200]  Knowledge is power.
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:23.200]  Like our bodies are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[1:05:23.200 --> 1:05:30.200]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals because it's so simple because you won't be under their control anymore.
[1:05:30.200 --> 1:05:39.200]  Well, the vitamin mineral fusion, the highest quality vitamin mineral fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form is now back in stock at infowarfstore.com.
[1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:41.200]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:44.200]  It funds the info war at the same time.
[1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:46.200]  No other product you can buy does that.
[1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:54.200]  So again, infowarfstore.com, it's back in stock, 50% off vitamin mineral fusion. I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[1:05:54.200 --> 1:06:17.200]  So take action today and give it to your first family as a gift.
[1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:25.200]  I need to get into this Democrat terrorism that's been happening as we enter the second hour, but I have not even plugged today. I am bad and this is more important.
[1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:34.200]  We have to stay on air, folks, to fight back against the New World Order propaganda that's leading people to take a deadly vaccine, die from it, and then deny that that's what happened.
[1:06:34.200 --> 1:06:49.200]  That's led us to a point where you can have an American woman 65 years old get assaulted, harassed, and arrested by a cop for not wearing a mask inside a Bank of America in Texas where there is no mask mandate for a fake pandemic that the media lied to them about.
[1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:55.200]  So we're at the front lines fighting this propaganda with truth. It's the only sword and shield that we can wield here.
[1:06:55.200 --> 1:07:00.200]  And we need to stay on air to fight that because, you know, there's very few and far between that are willing to stand up.
[1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:09.200]  Now, those few and far between that are willing to stand up are starting to take bigger leaps and strides, but it's still infowars leading the charge.
[1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:16.200]  So keep us on air by going to infowarsstore.com. We have the final hours right now.
[1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:20.200]  So Alex is back in town. He's going to have to cut new specials for tomorrow.
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:24.200]  So it's the final hours of free shipping store wide.
[1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:31.200]  And then the current sales we have vitamin mineral fusion 50% off down and out liquid sleep support 40% off.
[1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:38.200]  I will tell you, I tried down and out liquid sleep support for the first time last night.
[1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:43.200]  I, you know what, I'm all confused because of the changing in time.
[1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:46.200]  It kind of may have me confused and disoriented last night this morning.
[1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:51.200]  But let me tell you, yeah, I was down and out for sure.
[1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:57.200]  For about eight hours, probably I was down and out and was kind of shocking waking up to the clock.
[1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:01.200]  I was like, holy smokes, like down and out is serious stuff.
[1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:04.200]  But then I realized that we lost an hour too.
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:10.200]  So point is though, down and out the trifecta, the new addition to the trifecta of sleep support.
[1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:13.200]  We have an infowarsstore.com. I'm glad we have three different sleep support formulas.
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:16.200]  A lot of people struggle with sleep, including myself.
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:23.200]  And so it's good to have three different formulas to kind of go on and off each one so you don't get too tolerant to them and they remain effective.
[1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:28.200]  So down and out 40% off. That was got me down and out last night.
[1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:32.200]  Survival Shield X2 50% off turbo force 40% off.
[1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:36.200]  Supermail by Vitality 40% off.
[1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:40.200]  We still have privacy pouches available $10 off of those right now.
[1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:48.200]  And 50% off vitamin B12 all for 1250% off Alexa pure pro air filter.
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:50.200]  And I believe the water filters too.
[1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:52.200]  So these specials though have hours left.
[1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:56.200]  Alex is going to have to come cut new specials tomorrow now that he's back in town.
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:00.200]  So final hours of free shipping store wide.
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:05.200]  Now, guys, we've got all kinds of videos.
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:16.200]  So if you guys just want to be rolling this B roll, whether it's from LA or New York or Portland or wherever it's all from as I cover these headlines.
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:26.200]  But but remember as a backdrop, Ashley Babbit got executed on film in Washington DC by a Capitol police officer.
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:29.200]  We still don't know that individual's name.
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:33.200]  How is that possible and the big lie?
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:35.200]  Oh, police violence is racism.
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:38.200]  If that was a white person, they wouldn't have been shot.
[1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:40.200]  What about Ashley Babbit?
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:43.200]  And we don't even get to know the cops name.
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:48.200]  So that's interesting.
[1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:58.200]  But just remember that as a backdrop and remember that the Democrats have put DC under martial law lockdown without even a vote to protect their own criminal behavior.
[1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:00.200]  They just stole $2 trillion.
[1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:09.200]  So Congress just stole $2 trillion and they did it while they were protected by our military.
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:11.200]  Oh, man.
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:14.200]  But here we go.
[1:10:14.200 --> 1:10:19.200]  So will there be incitement charges for Joe Biden or Linda Sarsour?
[1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:25.200]  Linda Sarsour was leading rallies over the weekend.
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:31.200]  Speaking during rallies during the one year anniversary of Breonna Taylor's death saying we're going to have rallies.
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:32.200]  We're going to be louder than ever.
[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:34.200]  We're going to be in cities across America.
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:36.200]  And then that night what happened?
[1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:46.200]  Violence, destruction, criminal behavior, arson, assault, battery.
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:51.200]  Biden urges police reform as Breonna Taylor protests turned violent across the nation.
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:53.200]  So that's Biden's response.
[1:10:53.200 --> 1:11:01.200]  Hey, a bunch of people just went out and burned cities to the ground, assaulted police officers, attacked federal court buildings, guilty of arson, all kinds of criminal behavior.
[1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:04.200]  They get arrested and released and then arrested again.
[1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:05.200]  And what's Biden's response?
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:08.200]  We need police reform.
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:17.200]  Well, look, I'm telling you right now the quickest solution to this problem is to actually get rid of the police.
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:22.200]  It's not what I want necessarily to happen because it'll be a total breakdown of civilization.
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:29.200]  But at this point civilization is already broke and the police are only police because they need a paycheck.
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:32.200]  That's where we're at now.
[1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:34.200]  And so they really can't even do their job.
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:37.200]  It's all just political theater and ceremony.
[1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:40.200]  And so look, I feel bad for the police.
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:42.200]  I think for the most part they're good people.
[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:46.200]  They're in a bad situation and everybody needs a paycheck, folks.
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:49.200]  Everybody's got a mortgage, rent, bills, kids, whatever.
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:54.200]  So they can't quit even though I'm sure it's not a very positive experience for police right now,
[1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:58.200]  especially in Portland or Los Angeles or New York or Chicago,
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:03.200]  where the Democrat Party has basically put a target on your back to be murdered.
[1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:05.200]  But so you get attacked every night.
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:06.200]  The media doesn't even care.
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:08.200]  The FBI doesn't even care.
[1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:11.200]  And the politicians don't even care.
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:17.200]  So I'm serious, either police should just fully stand down at this point.
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:19.200]  That's if you just want to keep your jobs.
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:21.200]  I would just stand down, let them just burn it all.
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:23.200]  Hey, again, I'm not promoting this.
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:24.200]  I'm not the one that wants the violence.
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:27.200]  I'm just saying we got a problem here.
[1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:30.200]  And the only way people are going to realize that we have a problem here
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:34.200]  is if the police actually disappear for a month or so.
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:38.200]  And complete, and entire city blocks are burned to the ground.
[1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:46.200]  Entire city blocks are looted for every last scrap that these criminal thugs can find.
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:48.200]  Guess what?
[1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:51.200]  America will wake up real fast.
[1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:54.200]  And then when they end up at Nancy Pelosi's front door,
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:56.200]  and they end up at Maxine Waters' front door,
[1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:58.200]  and Chuck Schumer's front door,
[1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:00.200]  and the rest of the Democrats' front door, guess what?
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:02.200]  They're going to be begging for police then.
[1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:05.200]  But see, they'll have their own private security,
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:10.200]  which would expose them even further.
[1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:12.200]  But the FBI doesn't investigate,
[1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:15.200]  and they get arrested and released, folks.
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:17.200]  They get arrested and released.
[1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:19.200]  There are dozens, if not hundreds.
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:20.200]  We don't know the number.
[1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:23.200]  Dozens, if not hundreds, of Trump supporters, Americans,
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:25.200]  many of which are veterans,
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:27.200]  rotting in jail right now.
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:30.200]  Families, mothers, fathers, veterans, pastors,
[1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:33.200]  rotting in jail right now,
[1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:36.200]  because they were in Washington, D.C., on January 6th.
[1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:38.200]  Nobody's even reporting this except InfoWars.
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:41.200]  Because they get arrested.
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:42.200]  A Democrat judge says,
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:45.200]  if you're a threat to society, I have to keep you in jail
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:47.200]  until your court date, and then they delay the court date
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:49.200]  months and months and months and months and months
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:51.200]  because of the fake pandemic, they can't go to court.
[1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:53.200]  And they say, you can't be released.
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:54.200]  You're a threat to society.
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:58.200]  Children, mothers, fathers, pastors,
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:00.200]  rotting in jail cells right now
[1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:04.200]  because of the FBI and our politicians.
[1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:07.200]  Many of which, their only crime
[1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:09.200]  was being on Capitol grounds.
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:11.200]  That's it.
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:13.200]  That's a crime now.
[1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:15.200]  And it's going to be interesting to see what happens
[1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:17.200]  in the Q-Simon case.
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:19.200]  By the way, he's still rotting in a jail cell.
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:23.200]  His defense is arguing, how can you hold my client
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:25.200]  for entering a building illegally
[1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:27.200]  when he was waved in by the police?
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:29.200]  So that's in front of a judge right now
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:31.200]  with all the footage.
[1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:33.200]  But guess what?
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:35.200]  If you've got a Democrat judge,
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:37.200]  you're going to jail no matter what.
[1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:39.200]  And here's the difference.
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:41.200]  You know why Peter Ducey is the only person
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:43.200]  in the White House press corps
[1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:45.200]  that asks any real questions of Jen Psaki?
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:49.200]  Because everyone else is a Democrat.
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:52.200]  You have Democrats who are activists
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:55.200]  as judges and PAs and DAs
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:14:59.200]  and mayors and politicians,
[1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:01.200]  but they don't actually do their job.
[1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:06.200]  They put their agenda and their activism over their job.
[1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:08.200]  So that's why they're able to get away with this.
[1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:11.200]  And that's why Trump supporters are rotting in jails
[1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:14.200]  while individuals like a Montana man
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:17.200]  are arrested twice during the same riot
[1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:19.200]  in Portland over the weekend.
[1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:22.200]  Because Democrats are activists.
[1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:24.200]  They're not real.
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:26.200]  A Democrat on a journey,
[1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:30.200]  a jury or a bench or in politics
[1:15:30.200 --> 1:15:33.200]  will always put their agenda before reality,
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:35.200]  before the truth, before the evidence,
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:37.200]  before any of it.
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:39.200]  That's why these people are so dangerous, folks.
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:41.200]  That's why once you give them control,
[1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:43.200]  they never relinquish it.
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:45.200]  That's why they want you to wear the mask.
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:47.200]  That's why they want you to take a vaccine.
[1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:49.200]  That's why they want to take your guns.
[1:15:49.200 --> 1:15:51.200]  That's why they want to censor you on the Internet.
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:55.200]  Because they hate you
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:57.200]  and they'll do anything they can to destroy you.
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:15:59.200]  Blisters ask me all the time,
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:01.200]  why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:03.200]  Why do you have multiple high-quality items?
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:05.200]  Why do you do that?
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:07.200]  Different strokes for different folks.
[1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:09.200]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists,
[1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:11.200]  they say, hey, a lot of people
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:13.200]  love deep-earth pure crystal iodine,
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:15.200]  but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine
[1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:17.200]  and the two other types, because some people
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:19.200]  can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:21.200]  Boom, we did it. It's popular. It's X3.
[1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:23.200]  Is it better than X2? You decide.
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:25.200]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:27.200]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:29.200]  our very popular powdered pill sleeping.
[1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:31.200]  And that is down and out.
[1:16:31.200 --> 1:16:33.200]  It's super strong, way stronger
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:35.200]  than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.
[1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:37.200]  Different strokes for different folks,
[1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:39.200]  different formulas, and it's 40% off

[1:16:57.200 --> 1:16:59.200]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan
[1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:01.200]  for world government.
[1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:03.200]  But world government is only
[1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:05.200]  the control grid.
[1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:07.200]  Now, intermembers of the cult
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:09.200]  are told that they are going to
[1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:11.200]  transcend and become gods
[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:13.200]  and attain immortality.
[1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:15.200]  But the price for that is to carry out
[1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:17.200]  the orderly extermination
[1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:19.200]  of all carbon-based line forms.
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:21.200]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:23.200]  They are rewriting the entire
[1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:25.200]  genetic code of the planet.
[1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:27.200]  They are playing God.
[1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:29.200]  They believe they have been inspired
[1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:31.200]  by interdimensional entities
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:33.200]  that are giving them advanced technology
[1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:35.200]  to carry out this transformation.
[1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:37.200]  I know this sounds insane,
[1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:39.200]  but if you read the writings of the globalists,
[1:17:39.200 --> 1:17:41.200]  it's all on record.
[1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:43.200]  You have been warned.
[1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:45.200]  You have been given the information
[1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:47.200]  to say no to this plan.
[1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:49.200]  This is the end of all life
[1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:51.200]  on Earth as we know it.
[1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:53.200]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[1:17:53.200 --> 1:17:55.200]  As men age,
[1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:57.200]  they often experience
[1:17:57.200 --> 1:17:59.200]  a slowdown
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:01.200]  in vitality, energy,
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:03.200]  and overall wellness.
[1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:05.200]  And that's why
[1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:07.200]  we made one of our most popular
[1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:09.200]  formulas to date.
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:11.200]  Super male vitality.
[1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:13.200]  Specifically designed
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:15.200]  to assist the body
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:17.200]  in regulating proper balance
[1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:19.200]  to create superior vitality
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:21.200]  to create superior vitality
[1:18:21.200 --> 1:18:23.200]  in males.
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:25.200]  Now look.
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:27.200]  This unique formula promotes
[1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:29.200]  your body's own natural responses
[1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:31.200]  and it contains no synthetic
[1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:33.200]  chemicals
[1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:35.200]  and no unwanted additives.
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:37.200]  Yes.
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:39.200]  We're talking about ancient wisdom
[1:18:39.200 --> 1:18:41.200]  combined with modern technology.
[1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:43.200]  Working together in perfect
[1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:45.200]  synchronicity to help you get the most
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:47.200]  out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:49.200]  So what are you waiting for?

[1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:29.200]  right to Band-Aid video.
[1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:31.200]  Yes,
[1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:33.200]  Democrat terrorism continues to run
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:35.200]  rampant across the United States
[1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:35.200]  and the media continues to ignore it
[1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:37.200]  because of course they're not
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:41.200]  actual members of the media
[1:20:41.200 --> 1:20:43.200]  or journalist or reporters.
[1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:45.200]  They're well, Democrats,
[1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:47.200]  and so why would they call out
[1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:49.200]  their own criminal activity that they love to
[1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:51.200]  promote and engage in?
[1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:53.200]  Democrats promote the violence,
[1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:55.200]  then they hide the violence
[1:20:55.200 --> 1:20:57.200]  Then they say, oh, you're being violent.
[1:20:57.200 --> 1:21:07.120]  Now, you may remember over the summer, some of the violence that happened in Chicago,
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:11.580]  where you had all the police, dozens if not hundreds of police surrounding the Christopher
[1:21:11.580 --> 1:21:17.120]  Columbus statue, and they were surrounded by a Black Lives Matter Democrat mob, violent
[1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:20.200]  mob, insurrection mob.
[1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:26.160]  And so you had hundreds of Chicago police injured, you saw all these criminals throwing
[1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:33.920]  projectiles, bricks, pee-pee bottles, and all the other stuff that the left-wing terrorists
[1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:40.960]  are known to engage with, literally like bottles of pee-pee and poo-poo, that's what they do.
[1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:45.560]  They pee-pee and poo-poo over there, the Democrat Party terrorist.
[1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:51.880]  And so that statue, though, that was protected by the Chicago police when they were so viciously
[1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:56.640]  assaulted that day, well, it's now been removed.
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:02.240]  See, mob violence and Democrat terrorism accomplishes things.
[1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:03.920]  That's why they continue to do it.
[1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:09.440]  The media ignores it, and then we capitulate, and the cycle repeats itself until we stop
[1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:12.800]  the cycle, you understand?
[1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:20.120]  And the irony, of course, is they are still investigating the violence from that day.
[1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:25.120]  Chicago police seeking to identify people involved in last summer's class with officers
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:26.960]  at Columbus Statue in Grant Park.
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:31.280]  So hundreds of officers injured taken to the hospital.
[1:22:31.280 --> 1:22:35.800]  But even though they're still searching for those criminals, they gave them what they
[1:22:35.800 --> 1:22:43.040]  wanted, the Democrat terror mob, terrorist mob wins again, promoted and covered up by
[1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:47.800]  the mainstream media, funded by the Democrat Party, promoted by the Democrat Party.
[1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:51.680]  So, oh, but they took the statue down, even though they're still investigating the Democrat
[1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:54.720]  terrorists who were out there that day assaulting police officers.
[1:22:54.720 --> 1:22:55.720]  So that's good.
[1:22:55.720 --> 1:22:57.760]  Give the terrorist mob what it wants.
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:23:03.080]  I'm sure there will be no negative repercussions of that.
[1:23:03.080 --> 1:23:09.920]  And also, you have Democrat terrorists attacking individuals in the street, a man that has
[1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:15.000]  a sign that says children cannot consent to puberty blockers suffers broken arm after
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:19.640]  his Antifa gang assault.
[1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:28.800]  So once again, you have more, here's the video, you have more Democrat terrorism on the streets
[1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:31.760]  and these people won't even be arrested.
[1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:33.880]  They never are.
[1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:41.920]  And if they are, they get released, bailed out on Democrat money by Democrat DAs, district
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:46.160]  attorneys, prosecuting attorneys, always bail them out, but if you're a Trump supporter,
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:49.680]  you're going to rot in jail forever, you're going to get the worst out of the law.
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:53.840]  These people are behaving like true Nazis, except they're worse.
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:58.720]  And also, not only do you have the left-wing Democrat political violence that we see every
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:06.400]  day, the Democrat racist hate crimes continue to happen in New York, in California, and
[1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:12.960]  in Philadelphia, Guy's Roll Clip B-roll from 13, and apparently this is just commonplace
[1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:15.800]  in Philadelphia when I was researching this story.
[1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:21.640]  There's just basically a dirt bike gang in Philadelphia that just runs roughshod over
[1:24:21.640 --> 1:24:22.640]  the city.
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:29.480]  Now this individual is on his dirt bike, pulls out his gun, and finally, his other friends,
[1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:33.240]  so he's attacking people in their vehicles, smashing bricks in the vehicles, pulls out
[1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:35.640]  his gun, nearly kills an Asian man.
[1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:39.920]  So the hate crimes against Asians and white people by Black people continue, you're not
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:43.140]  allowed to say that, you're not allowed to report on that, you're not allowed to show
[1:24:43.140 --> 1:24:48.660]  the crime statistics, you're not allowed to show the hit game videos where they attack
[1:24:48.660 --> 1:24:52.160]  Asians and white people in the streets and kill them sometimes.
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:55.680]  You're not allowed to talk about that, you're not allowed to show that, it's racist to show
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:25:02.000]  that, it's racist to show the racists attacking innocent people.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:07.220]  So this is just what the Democrat Party is up to, promoting their terrorism, promoting
[1:25:07.220 --> 1:25:08.700]  their mob violence.
[1:25:08.700 --> 1:25:11.580]  It is, after all, the biggest hate group in the United States.
[1:25:11.580 --> 1:25:12.660]  That is the Democrat Party.
[1:25:12.660 --> 1:25:15.140]  It is, of course, the biggest terror group in the United States.
[1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:17.500]  That is, of course, the Democrat Party.
[1:25:17.500 --> 1:25:24.060]  But they can engage in all their criminal mob, mafia violence as they steal two trillion
[1:25:24.060 --> 1:25:27.380]  dollars from you behind the National Guard.
[1:25:27.380 --> 1:25:31.660]  But you can't have 4th of July.
[1:25:31.660 --> 1:25:34.660]  Biden said, you're not allowed to have 4th of July unless you get your vaccine, then
[1:25:34.660 --> 1:25:40.580]  maybe we'll let you be free, because, you know, he's the tyrant in chief now who wakes
[1:25:40.580 --> 1:25:44.180]  up every day and doesn't know where he is, his own admission.
[1:25:44.180 --> 1:25:51.180]  But now the National Park Service under Biden is rejecting a request from South Dakota to
[1:25:51.180 --> 1:25:53.940]  have fireworks at Mount Rushmore this year.
[1:25:53.940 --> 1:25:58.620]  So the Democrats were allowed to engage in straight-up terrorism in the streets.
[1:25:58.620 --> 1:26:03.860]  The Democrats were allowed to engage in straight-up promotion and bailing out of this terrorism,
[1:26:03.860 --> 1:26:08.020]  not to mention the hate crimes and racism that they're engaged with on a daily basis.
[1:26:08.020 --> 1:26:15.020]  They're allowed to do this all day long, but you can't even have fireworks at Mount Rushmore
[1:26:15.020 --> 1:26:17.140]  on the 4th of July.
[1:26:17.140 --> 1:26:19.140]  See what happens when Democrats get in charge, folks?
[1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:24.900]  These people destroy everything, everything.
[1:26:24.900 --> 1:26:25.900]  This is a cancer.
[1:26:25.900 --> 1:26:27.340]  This is a cancer of civilization.
[1:26:27.340 --> 1:26:28.980]  This is a cancer of culture.
[1:26:28.980 --> 1:26:34.620]  Yeah, you have a cancer of culture run by the Democrats, but it's really a cancer culture.
[1:26:34.620 --> 1:26:40.260]  It will kill our culture and civilization, and it's metastasizing now.
[1:26:40.260 --> 1:26:44.500]  And so, you know what has to happen?
[1:26:44.500 --> 1:26:50.220]  On the 4th of July, patriots need to go to Mount Rushmore and just have your own firework
[1:26:50.220 --> 1:26:51.220]  display.
[1:26:51.220 --> 1:26:57.700]  Shove it in these globalists' rear end, shove it in these Democrats' rear end.
[1:26:57.700 --> 1:27:00.220]  We're free people.
[1:27:00.220 --> 1:27:02.000]  You don't tell us to stay home.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.460]  You don't tell us we can't have barbecues.
[1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:08.300]  You don't tell us we can't hug our grandmas.
[1:27:08.300 --> 1:27:09.380]  You are the criminals.
[1:27:09.380 --> 1:27:11.340]  You are the tyrants.
[1:27:11.340 --> 1:27:16.940]  So let's see what happens at Mount Rushmore this 4th of July as they are refusing to let
[1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:20.460]  people have the firework display there.
[1:27:20.460 --> 1:27:22.900]  Just to know them is not going to rest easy on this one.
[1:27:22.900 --> 1:27:24.940]  I predict the governor of South Dakota.
[1:27:24.940 --> 1:27:30.300]  And I don't know if the American people will or the citizens of South Dakota will either.
[1:27:30.300 --> 1:27:37.500]  But you know, I'll finish with this, liberalism, Democrat party politics are a cancer to culture
[1:27:37.500 --> 1:27:38.500]  and civilization.
[1:27:38.500 --> 1:27:42.620]  And it's the strangest thing because they've ruined sports.
[1:27:42.620 --> 1:27:46.140]  You know, one of my escapes, even after I left the sports media, was still just maybe
[1:27:46.140 --> 1:27:47.140]  on a Saturday.
[1:27:47.140 --> 1:27:48.820]  I'd like to watch a sports game.
[1:27:48.820 --> 1:27:52.380]  I can go into the suspended reality and be a kid again.
[1:27:52.380 --> 1:27:57.420]  And it's fun to cheer and watch sports and the glamour and the majesty and all of it.
[1:27:57.420 --> 1:27:59.100]  It's dead.
[1:27:59.100 --> 1:28:00.900]  Liberals have killed sports, folks.
[1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:03.900]  And it's not just liberals, but it's other elements.
[1:28:03.900 --> 1:28:06.380]  But sports are not even enjoyable anymore.
[1:28:06.380 --> 1:28:09.780]  All the propaganda, it's all about the individual now.
[1:28:09.780 --> 1:28:12.620]  They're all rich, spoiled brats.
[1:28:12.620 --> 1:28:19.100]  And you can tell when you're watching the old footage of Marvin Hagler, and I was just
[1:28:19.100 --> 1:28:21.540]  watching old games that I went to as a kid.
[1:28:21.540 --> 1:28:25.100]  It's just so much more enjoyable than the new sports that are just shoving all the propaganda
[1:28:25.100 --> 1:28:26.540]  down your throat.
[1:28:26.540 --> 1:28:29.100]  Everything is a money suck.
[1:28:29.100 --> 1:28:30.620]  It's not even about the game.
[1:28:30.620 --> 1:28:33.260]  It's very disrespectful to the game, actually.
[1:28:33.260 --> 1:28:34.260]  But don't worry.
[1:28:34.260 --> 1:28:38.940]  They're making every piece of space on that TV is a bought advertisement.
[1:28:38.940 --> 1:28:42.500]  Every player is larger than life with their money in their social media.
[1:28:42.500 --> 1:28:43.500]  And don't worry.
[1:28:43.500 --> 1:28:47.660]  The left-wing propaganda is everywhere as well infiltrating it.
[1:28:47.660 --> 1:28:52.060]  So you have to go watch sports from like the 90s and before, or the early 2000s, even enjoy
[1:28:52.060 --> 1:28:53.060]  it anymore.
[1:28:53.060 --> 1:28:54.060]  Because why?
[1:28:54.060 --> 1:28:58.620]  Liberalism is a cancer to culture, and it kills it.
[1:28:58.620 --> 1:29:01.700]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[1:29:01.700 --> 1:29:05.900]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[1:29:05.900 --> 1:29:06.900]  pass.
[1:29:06.900 --> 1:29:10.620]  So many authoritarians, if you show the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where
[1:29:10.620 --> 1:29:15.500]  all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[1:29:15.500 --> 1:29:19.060]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[1:29:19.060 --> 1:29:20.060]  that move.
[1:29:20.060 --> 1:29:24.060]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[1:29:24.060 --> 1:29:29.740]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[1:29:29.740 --> 1:29:34.660]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[1:29:34.660 --> 1:29:40.340]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[1:29:40.340 --> 1:29:44.940]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[1:29:44.940 --> 1:29:50.940]  year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute, or they wouldn't
[1:29:50.940 --> 1:29:53.900]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[1:29:53.900 --> 1:29:58.500]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[1:29:58.500 --> 1:30:02.940]  As you know, we're always upping our game at Info Wars, and we brought you a new supplement,
[1:30:02.940 --> 1:30:06.540]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[1:30:06.540 --> 1:30:07.540]  It is down and out.
[1:30:07.540 --> 1:30:09.460]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[1:30:09.460 --> 1:30:12.460]  We mean down your bed sleeping hard throughout the night.
[1:30:12.460 --> 1:30:15.540]  It's got four milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[1:30:15.540 --> 1:30:18.100]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[1:30:18.100 --> 1:30:21.740]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[1:30:21.740 --> 1:30:26.660]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[1:30:26.660 --> 1:30:29.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[1:30:29.260 --> 1:30:32.420]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[1:30:32.420 --> 1:30:34.420]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:38.540]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[1:30:38.540 --> 1:30:39.540]  It's incredible.
[1:30:39.540 --> 1:30:41.700]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[1:30:41.700 --> 1:30:44.300]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[1:30:53.140 --> 1:31:01.140]  I actually bought this at Blocks, UHF Frequency.
[1:31:01.140 --> 1:31:07.140]  Nodin and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[1:31:07.140 --> 1:31:14.300]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[1:31:14.300 --> 1:31:15.300]  battery.
[1:31:15.300 --> 1:31:21.580]  Now, with the InfoWare's privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.

[1:31:33.100 --> 1:31:40.300]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking
[1:31:40.300 --> 1:31:43.540]  your every move through your mobile phone.
[1:31:43.540 --> 1:31:48.820]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.

[1:31:58.380 --> 1:32:01.500]  This is Greg Rees from InfoWare.com.
[1:32:01.500 --> 1:32:05.660]  I have many reasons to be grateful for working at InfoWare.
[1:32:05.660 --> 1:32:10.460]  One of them is that we support ourselves with great products that promote physical health
[1:32:10.460 --> 1:32:12.380]  and vitality.
[1:32:12.380 --> 1:32:18.620]  I've been using health supplements for years, and I have found our products at InfoWareStore.com
[1:32:18.620 --> 1:32:23.820]  to be the best, especially our vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:32:23.820 --> 1:32:28.900]  Before trying vitamin mineral fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually
[1:32:28.900 --> 1:32:29.900]  did anything.
[1:32:29.900 --> 1:32:33.820]  I never felt much of an effect from other products.
[1:32:33.820 --> 1:32:38.660]  But I felt vitamin mineral fusion the first time I took it, immediately.
[1:32:38.660 --> 1:32:40.700]  I love how it dissolves in water.
[1:32:40.700 --> 1:32:42.620]  I take it every day with my supper.
[1:32:42.620 --> 1:32:45.260]  It tastes great, feels great.
[1:32:45.260 --> 1:32:48.020]  And right now, it's 50% off.
[1:32:48.020 --> 1:32:54.900]  It sells out fast, so stock up now at 50% off at InfoWareStore.com.

[1:33:37.100 --> 1:33:41.940]  But I'm hosting the Alex Jones Show today, and so we're going to have Harrison Smith
[1:33:41.940 --> 1:33:42.940]  in studio.
[1:33:42.940 --> 1:33:45.100]  And Patrick Howley is going to be his guest.
[1:33:45.100 --> 1:33:49.740]  Let me tell you, I think Patrick Howley is going to be dropping some exclusive intelligence
[1:33:49.740 --> 1:33:54.860]  coming up on InfoWare Sunday Night Live regarding the Vegas shooting.
[1:33:54.860 --> 1:33:59.740]  And of course, it's pretty much the same intel that we had when it happened.
[1:33:59.740 --> 1:34:03.300]  But he's going to lay out some more of the details as he's being threatened and intimidated
[1:34:03.300 --> 1:34:04.300]  right now.
[1:34:04.300 --> 1:34:06.700]  So you're going to want to watch Harrison Smith and Patrick Howley coming up.

[1:34:44.260 --> 1:34:51.020]  Let me tell you, our newest sleep support formula, down and out the liquid pink sheer version
[1:34:51.020 --> 1:34:53.940]  really of rocket rest.
[1:34:53.940 --> 1:35:00.380]  I tried it for the first time last night and it is very effective, perhaps the most effective.
[1:35:00.380 --> 1:35:05.620]  And I'm not sure between that and rocket rest, very similar results for me.
[1:35:05.620 --> 1:35:09.420]  And I was just kind of just confused and disoriented when I woke up and it was like so late, but
[1:35:09.420 --> 1:35:12.940]  then I realized we lost an hour while I was sleeping.
[1:35:12.940 --> 1:35:23.220]  But down and out, brand new to InfoWareStore.com and introductory rate of 40% off right now.
[1:35:23.220 --> 1:35:29.420]  So final hours of free shipping, store wide, take advantage of that at InfoWareStore.com.
[1:35:29.420 --> 1:35:36.580]  Okay, let me continue on with the rest of these news stories.
[1:35:36.580 --> 1:35:42.340]  Once again, the Democrat Party and their media cohorts, all they do is lie.
[1:35:42.340 --> 1:35:44.420]  That's just the reality of the situation.
[1:35:44.420 --> 1:35:46.700]  And so here's one example.
[1:35:46.700 --> 1:35:52.900]  Pelosi says climate change is responsible for crisis on the southern border.
[1:35:52.900 --> 1:35:57.180]  So they don't know what to do to cover up this total catastrophe happening at the southern
[1:35:57.180 --> 1:36:00.700]  border because of Joe Biden's policies, which aren't really his policies.
[1:36:00.700 --> 1:36:03.860]  Who knows whose policies they actually are.
[1:36:03.860 --> 1:36:06.340]  Biden doesn't know his policies.
[1:36:06.340 --> 1:36:09.700]  He doesn't even know where he is.
[1:36:09.700 --> 1:36:13.900]  So Pelosi says it's climate change, wow.
[1:36:13.900 --> 1:36:14.900]  Now what is it really?
[1:36:14.900 --> 1:36:20.060]  It's really the fact that you've opened the border and that you're promising free handouts
[1:36:20.060 --> 1:36:25.740]  and that they're coming from hellhole countries destroyed by communism.
[1:36:25.740 --> 1:36:27.980]  But don't let the truth get in the way of the big lie.
[1:36:27.980 --> 1:36:29.980]  No, it's climate change says Pelosi.
[1:36:29.980 --> 1:36:34.820]  So they're trying to find a way to justify the fact that they have now hundreds of thousands
[1:36:34.820 --> 1:36:37.100]  of illegal immigrants pouring over the southern border.
[1:36:37.100 --> 1:36:40.220]  They're testing positive for COVID and they're releasing them into your cities.
[1:36:40.220 --> 1:36:41.540]  They're putting them on planes.
[1:36:41.540 --> 1:36:42.980]  They're putting them on helicopters.
[1:36:42.980 --> 1:36:44.580]  They're putting them on buses.
[1:36:44.580 --> 1:36:50.420]  And they're releasing them into your major cities, hundreds of thousands a month.
[1:36:50.420 --> 1:36:57.500]  I'll predict right now that May, the month of May, you'll have 300,000 illegal border
[1:36:57.500 --> 1:36:58.500]  crossings.
[1:36:58.500 --> 1:37:03.100]  It'll be a new record and it's called an invasion, folks.
[1:37:03.100 --> 1:37:07.460]  A functioning society, a functioning country calls this an invasion.
[1:37:07.460 --> 1:37:08.460]  And it is an invasion.
[1:37:08.460 --> 1:37:12.300]  I'm not saying the people invading us are bad, but you do have the drug cartels running
[1:37:12.300 --> 1:37:15.860]  their drugs and their deadly fentanyl, which by the way, you have record amounts of fentanyl
[1:37:15.860 --> 1:37:17.660]  being taken off the streets right now.
[1:37:17.660 --> 1:37:19.180]  Yeah, it's because the borders are open again.
[1:37:19.180 --> 1:37:24.980]  Oh, and it's Biden's, one of Biden's appointees invests in one of the companies that makes
[1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:25.980]  the heroin.
[1:37:25.980 --> 1:37:30.260]  Oh, you can't even make this stuff up, Gupta.
[1:37:30.260 --> 1:37:31.260]  That's her name.
[1:37:31.260 --> 1:37:32.260]  Gupta.
[1:37:32.260 --> 1:37:35.700]  And she's invested millions of dollars in a company that makes heroin that gets smothered
[1:37:35.700 --> 1:37:36.700]  over the southern border.
[1:37:36.700 --> 1:37:39.820]  But don't let that get in the way of a good Biden appointee.
[1:37:39.820 --> 1:37:43.260]  If it's even his appointee, it's total criminal behavior.
[1:37:43.260 --> 1:37:49.460]  And so the Democrats need any excuse they can for the overflow of the kids in cages.
[1:37:49.460 --> 1:37:53.420]  They had to reopen the cages, actually, their reception centers now, but literally the places
[1:37:53.420 --> 1:37:59.020]  that they called cages where they sent for their photo shoots with AOC and the rest.
[1:37:59.020 --> 1:38:05.860]  Those were closed by Trump, the Democrats, Biden had to reopen them for all the overflow.
[1:38:05.860 --> 1:38:09.580]  So they needed somehow to cover this disaster at the southern border up.
[1:38:09.580 --> 1:38:11.620]  There were parts of the wall.
[1:38:11.620 --> 1:38:17.900]  They were needed one or two days, one or two days, two days max to complete part of these
[1:38:17.900 --> 1:38:22.340]  sections of the wall where there's like 20, 30 foot gaps, Biden shut it down.
[1:38:22.340 --> 1:38:25.180]  He literally called and said, stop this construction.
[1:38:25.180 --> 1:38:30.300]  And now there's these huge gaps in the wall and they're just pouring in.
[1:38:30.300 --> 1:38:37.020]  You can look at all these different journalists, Julio Rosas, Ben Berklam, I forget the other
[1:38:37.020 --> 1:38:43.380]  lady at Fox, Laura Logan, folks, they go down to the southern border to do a report and
[1:38:43.380 --> 1:38:48.660]  they can't even get their camera set up in time to capture the thousands of people pouring
[1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:49.660]  in illegally.
[1:38:49.660 --> 1:38:53.660]  So they pull out their phones and they film it on their phone because they can't even
[1:38:53.660 --> 1:39:00.420]  get a camera set up because they get down there and immediately they're pouring across.
[1:39:00.420 --> 1:39:04.900]  And that's why you see all the footage of it shot on cell phones because they don't
[1:39:04.900 --> 1:39:10.220]  even have enough time to get a camera set up on a tripod.
[1:39:10.220 --> 1:39:13.260]  So it's like, oh, here comes the southern border, crossing is happening illegally, get
[1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:16.380]  out the cell phone, the camera's not ready.
[1:39:16.380 --> 1:39:17.380]  And what does Pelosi say?
[1:39:17.380 --> 1:39:18.860]  Oh, it's climate change.
[1:39:18.860 --> 1:39:25.940]  Now the funny thing is, you have more expats moving to Central America right now, perhaps
[1:39:25.940 --> 1:39:29.060]  ever than has ever been in this country's history.
[1:39:29.060 --> 1:39:30.140]  They're moving to Belize.
[1:39:30.140 --> 1:39:32.940]  They are moving to Mexico.
[1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:36.140]  They are moving to Nicaragua.
[1:39:36.140 --> 1:39:40.700]  There's whole communities of expats buying up land and turning it into neighborhoods
[1:39:40.700 --> 1:39:48.940]  on in the Gulf, on rivers, I know multiple people that have done this.
[1:39:48.940 --> 1:39:53.060]  So they go to Costa Rica, I mean, I'm serious, the amount of expats moving to Central America.
[1:39:53.060 --> 1:39:54.940]  So what does that tell you?
[1:39:54.940 --> 1:40:02.900]  So the globalists or communist party politics have destroyed Central America.
[1:40:02.900 --> 1:40:07.780]  So all the people, the number is now at in the last 10 or 20 years, the United States
[1:40:07.780 --> 1:40:11.860]  of America has taken 15%.
[1:40:11.860 --> 1:40:14.300]  This number could be up to 20 before long.
[1:40:14.300 --> 1:40:20.300]  I don't even know what you would search guys, but we've taken now 15% in the last couple
[1:40:20.300 --> 1:40:27.300]  of decades of Central America's entire population, 15%.
[1:40:27.300 --> 1:40:30.180]  They broke those civilizations.
[1:40:30.180 --> 1:40:33.700]  The same policies the Democrats want here broke Central America.
[1:40:33.700 --> 1:40:35.060]  So yeah, these people are downtrodden.
[1:40:35.060 --> 1:40:36.060]  They try to come to America.
[1:40:36.060 --> 1:40:37.060]  They think it's going to be better.
[1:40:37.060 --> 1:40:43.100]  Meanwhile, successful smart people in America are rushing to Nicaragua.
[1:40:43.100 --> 1:40:49.340]  What rushing to Honduras rushing to Belize, because they can buy cheap property on a river
[1:40:49.340 --> 1:40:55.740]  or a beach and farm and grow their own food and not have to deal with the collapsing United
[1:40:55.740 --> 1:41:04.980]  States of America and the tyranny here by what a dichotomy that is.
[1:41:04.980 --> 1:41:08.100]  But Pelosi says it's because of climate change.
[1:41:08.100 --> 1:41:17.180]  Once again, telling the big lie, Darrell Issa understands the Democrat hypocrisy.
[1:41:17.180 --> 1:41:22.300]  He says Democrats are taking credit for the vaccine and blaming Trump for the border crisis.
[1:41:22.300 --> 1:41:23.860]  Of course, what's the reality?
[1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:27.460]  Trump was actually getting the border crisis under control.
[1:41:27.460 --> 1:41:31.180]  And if it wasn't for Trump, you wouldn't be having these vaccines right now.
[1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:38.220]  I don't know if that's totally true because the vaccine agenda was obviously always there.
[1:41:38.220 --> 1:41:41.900]  But for whatever reason, Trump really wants the credit for the vaccines.
[1:41:41.900 --> 1:41:43.180]  And I know why.
[1:41:43.180 --> 1:41:47.060]  It's because he sees all of his friends and all the liberals begging for the vaccine,
[1:41:47.060 --> 1:41:50.340]  saying it's the greatest thing ever, saying thank God for the vaccine, like getting on
[1:41:50.340 --> 1:41:52.540]  their knees crying because they can get a vaccine.
[1:41:52.540 --> 1:41:54.940]  So Trump's just like, hey, I'm the one that did that.
[1:41:54.940 --> 1:41:55.940]  Remember that.
[1:41:55.940 --> 1:41:58.420]  You hate me so much, but I'm the one that got you the vaccine, so understand why he
[1:41:58.420 --> 1:41:59.420]  does it.
[1:41:59.420 --> 1:42:02.180]  There's kind of more of an ego thing.
[1:42:02.180 --> 1:42:05.820]  But the reality is he launched Operation Warp Speed.
[1:42:05.820 --> 1:42:09.100]  That's why the vaccines got rushed to delivery.
[1:42:09.100 --> 1:42:10.580]  But Biden says, oh, that was me.
[1:42:10.580 --> 1:42:14.340]  Biden says there was no plan at all for a vaccine when he got into the White House,
[1:42:14.340 --> 1:42:16.460]  even though he'd already been vaccinated.
[1:42:16.460 --> 1:42:19.900]  That's how big of a liar he is, or he doesn't even know where he is.
[1:42:19.900 --> 1:42:23.500]  And then there's the border crisis was actually starting to move in the right direction under
[1:42:23.500 --> 1:42:24.500]  Trump.
[1:42:24.500 --> 1:42:25.500]  We're getting the border under control.
[1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:30.620]  The wall was almost completed, and then the Democrats come in, stop the wall, open the
[1:42:30.620 --> 1:42:32.740]  border, promise free handouts, and it becomes a crisis again.
[1:42:32.740 --> 1:42:33.740]  And what do they say?
[1:42:33.740 --> 1:42:36.140]  They blame Trump.
[1:42:36.140 --> 1:42:37.140]  They blame Trump.
[1:42:37.140 --> 1:42:38.780]  Seriously, how does it end?
[1:42:38.780 --> 1:42:42.940]  I really always wonder though, how it ends, how does it end with an entire political
[1:42:42.940 --> 1:42:47.420]  party that spews nothing but lies 24-7?
[1:42:47.420 --> 1:42:50.260]  How does that end?
[1:42:50.260 --> 1:42:56.540]  How does that end when the media and the Democrat Party lie to you 24-7 100% of the time?
[1:42:56.540 --> 1:42:59.260]  Where is the end of this?
[1:42:59.260 --> 1:43:06.260]  Look, I've proven that M-Full Wars information is some of the best in the world.
[1:43:06.260 --> 1:43:08.700]  It's just absolutely on target.
[1:43:08.700 --> 1:43:11.780]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[1:43:11.780 --> 1:43:13.140]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[1:43:13.140 --> 1:43:17.220]  I believe in humanity, and I want to see you empowered because I know that John F. Kennedy
[1:43:17.220 --> 1:43:21.140]  was right, a raising tide raises all ships.
[1:43:21.140 --> 1:43:26.380]  Now, the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have, the M-FullWars.com

[1:43:57.900 --> 1:44:01.740]  Listers ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[1:44:01.740 --> 1:44:04.380]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodine?
[1:44:04.380 --> 1:44:05.380]  Why do you do that?
[1:44:05.380 --> 1:44:07.620]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[1:44:07.620 --> 1:44:12.300]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists, and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep-earth,
[1:44:12.300 --> 1:44:13.300]  pure crystal iodine.
[1:44:13.300 --> 1:44:17.060]  But you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types, because some
[1:44:17.060 --> 1:44:19.100]  people can't absorb pure iodine.
[1:44:19.100 --> 1:44:20.260]  Boom, we did it.
[1:44:20.260 --> 1:44:21.260]  It's popular at sex three.
[1:44:21.260 --> 1:44:22.820]  Is it better than X2?
[1:44:22.820 --> 1:44:23.820]  You decide.
[1:44:23.820 --> 1:44:24.820]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[1:44:24.820 --> 1:44:30.700]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid.
[1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:32.100]  And that is down and out.
[1:44:32.100 --> 1:44:37.020]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[1:44:37.020 --> 1:44:39.500]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas.

[1:44:58.660 --> 1:45:00.220]  The people are awakening.
[1:45:00.220 --> 1:45:03.380]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[1:45:03.380 --> 1:45:04.660]  Cellphones are an amazing tool.
[1:45:04.660 --> 1:45:07.420]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[1:45:07.420 --> 1:45:13.020]  Big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHICOMS especially,
[1:45:13.020 --> 1:45:18.620]  are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when
[1:45:18.620 --> 1:45:21.140]  they're able to scoop up millions of people's data.
[1:45:21.140 --> 1:45:25.420]  They can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[1:45:25.420 --> 1:45:32.260]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[1:45:32.260 --> 1:45:33.700]  In their own words, they admit it.
[1:45:33.700 --> 1:45:38.620]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and block-it-block-it and things like that for more than a decade.
[1:45:38.620 --> 1:45:40.580]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[1:45:40.580 --> 1:45:41.580]  They're faraday cages.
[1:45:41.580 --> 1:45:43.340]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[1:45:43.340 --> 1:45:45.340]  They work absolutely great.
[1:45:45.340 --> 1:45:50.340]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[1:45:50.340 --> 1:45:53.540]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because
[1:45:53.540 --> 1:45:54.540]  it's not their business.
[1:45:54.540 --> 1:45:58.260]  Get yours at mforestore.com today.
[1:45:58.260 --> 1:46:01.780]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:46:01.780 --> 1:46:05.900]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:46:05.900 --> 1:46:09.100]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:46:09.100 --> 1:46:12.180]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[1:46:12.180 --> 1:46:13.500]  can to shut us down.
[1:46:13.500 --> 1:46:17.780]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air and please support the local states you're
[1:46:17.780 --> 1:46:18.780]  listening to as well.
[1:46:18.780 --> 1:46:24.900]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[1:46:24.900 --> 1:46:29.820]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:46:29.820 --> 1:46:31.300]  in the face of this thing.
[1:46:31.300 --> 1:46:33.420]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:46:33.420 --> 1:46:37.740]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:46:37.740 --> 1:46:42.580]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast, however you can, and
[1:46:42.580 --> 1:46:48.380]  buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:48.380 --> 1:46:52.900]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[1:46:52.900 --> 1:46:57.940]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:46:57.940 --> 1:47:00.940]  Thank you so much.
[1:47:00.940 --> 1:47:05.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:05.140 --> 1:47:18.780]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[1:47:18.780 --> 1:47:23.500]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:47:23.500 --> 1:47:26.700]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:47:26.700 --> 1:47:31.340]  In the final segment of this Sunday's Alex Jones Show, don't forget Harrison Smith coming
[1:47:31.340 --> 1:47:35.660]  up with Sunday Night Live, normally hosted by yours truly, but Harrison Smith fulfilling
[1:47:35.660 --> 1:47:38.860]  those duties tonight as I'm in studio for the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:38.860 --> 1:47:44.060]  He'll be back on air in studio tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central God willing with the Alex Jones
[1:47:44.060 --> 1:47:45.060]  Show.
[1:47:45.060 --> 1:47:47.180]  Patrick Halley also coming up with Harrison Smith.
[1:47:47.180 --> 1:47:50.540]  There's going to be a lot of important information discussed there.
[1:47:50.540 --> 1:47:54.340]  And what I think I'm going to do is, because Alex likes it when we pitch to the other
[1:47:54.340 --> 1:47:55.340]  shows.
[1:47:55.340 --> 1:48:01.900]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to tell a story at the beginning of the broadcast pitching
[1:48:01.900 --> 1:48:02.900]  to Harrison Smith.
[1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:06.820]  I'm going to get his response to it, but I'm going to tell a story about something I experienced
[1:48:06.820 --> 1:48:12.180]  this weekend being out and about in Austin with some buddies now that the mask mandate
[1:48:12.180 --> 1:48:13.180]  is lifted.
[1:48:13.180 --> 1:48:18.060]  I experienced some pretty interesting stuff that I want to just run by Harrison before
[1:48:18.060 --> 1:48:19.940]  he gets into his stuff.
[1:48:19.940 --> 1:48:23.220]  So guys, I'll probably just come right back out there so we don't have to do another setup
[1:48:23.220 --> 1:48:25.780]  and I'll sit right out there and we'll transfer it to Harrison.
[1:48:25.780 --> 1:48:33.300]  But I do have some news to cover here before we give the baton to Harrison Smith to host
[1:48:33.300 --> 1:48:36.260]  Sunday Night Live.
[1:48:36.260 --> 1:48:39.300]  Here are some of the other headlines.
[1:48:39.300 --> 1:48:44.820]  Organization, which is a left wing organization, the Slow Factory Foundation, I did some research
[1:48:44.820 --> 1:48:45.820]  into them.
[1:48:45.820 --> 1:48:50.500]  It doesn't seem that they're too, you know, sorted in their affairs or their affiliations,
[1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:55.500]  but it's the big left wing crazy group, the guy that founds it likes to paint his fingernails.
[1:48:55.500 --> 1:48:56.900]  So that's cute.
[1:48:56.900 --> 1:49:03.460]  So organization says sharing Oprah Winfrey interview memes is digital blackface.
[1:49:03.460 --> 1:49:10.300]  And so obviously that Oprah Winfrey interview, the content of it, the subjects of discussion
[1:49:10.300 --> 1:49:14.140]  didn't really go viral, but the memes did.
[1:49:14.140 --> 1:49:18.900]  All the memes of Meghan Markle and all the memes of Oprah went mega viral.
[1:49:18.900 --> 1:49:22.580]  Nobody really knows or cares what they talked about, but the memes went viral.
[1:49:22.580 --> 1:49:27.140]  So that angers the left wing because this is, of course, a propaganda event for them.
[1:49:27.140 --> 1:49:34.820]  And when the propaganda doesn't hit, but then it gets basically spun and turned into propaganda
[1:49:34.820 --> 1:49:39.620]  against them with the Oprah Winfrey memes, of course, then they start to panic.
[1:49:39.620 --> 1:49:42.460]  So the left wing says, don't share Oprah Winfrey memes.
[1:49:42.460 --> 1:49:45.140]  That's digital blackface.
[1:49:45.140 --> 1:49:50.300]  Yes, and these people haven't gone completely insane, though.
[1:49:50.300 --> 1:49:52.900]  Some people are realizing, though, that they've gone completely insane.
[1:49:52.900 --> 1:49:58.460]  Sarah Silverman, one of them, in an interesting podcast, I guess it's her own podcast.
[1:49:58.460 --> 1:49:59.580]  They all have podcasts now.
[1:49:59.580 --> 1:50:00.740]  Nobody listens.
[1:50:00.740 --> 1:50:04.300]  But she says she doesn't want to be associated with the Democrat Party anymore.
[1:50:04.300 --> 1:50:07.740]  And you can tell it's like the most real I've ever seen, Sarah Silverman.
[1:50:07.740 --> 1:50:13.340]  I mean, her potty humor is real, but this was like kind of like down to earth real.
[1:50:13.340 --> 1:50:18.980]  And you could tell that there was Biden voter remorse, or I don't know if she voted for
[1:50:18.980 --> 1:50:24.420]  Biden, but there was Biden promotion, Democrat Party promotion remorse.
[1:50:24.420 --> 1:50:28.860]  And you could tell that she's having this realization in this podcast.
[1:50:28.860 --> 1:50:30.540]  And now she doesn't want to be affiliated with parties.
[1:50:30.540 --> 1:50:32.020]  Shouldn't we be affiliated with any of it?
[1:50:32.020 --> 1:50:36.180]  She just wants to be, yeah, yeah, you figured out these people hate us, huh?
[1:50:36.180 --> 1:50:37.180]  You finally got it.
[1:50:37.180 --> 1:50:38.180]  Politicians are corrupt.
[1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:40.660]  You shouldn't be involved with any of these people.
[1:50:40.660 --> 1:50:46.740]  But Hollywood has been so in the tank for the Democrat Party for so long.
[1:50:46.740 --> 1:50:50.580]  But the weird thing that she mentions in here, and this is what I'm wanting liberals and
[1:50:50.580 --> 1:50:51.740]  leftists to realize.
[1:50:51.740 --> 1:50:54.740]  And this is why I'll tell the story with Harrison Smith coming up.
[1:50:54.740 --> 1:51:01.140]  And there's a bit of it in my street interview from last Monday at the mask event.
[1:51:01.140 --> 1:51:05.340]  But she's calling liberals absolutists.
[1:51:05.340 --> 1:51:15.740]  In this, absolutists, the real world, the real world word that she's looking for is totalitarians.
[1:51:15.740 --> 1:51:18.620]  Absolutists is fair enough, but it's the same thing.
[1:51:18.620 --> 1:51:20.620]  They're totalitarians.
[1:51:20.620 --> 1:51:25.380]  So that's what it's time for the left wing to realize that that's what they've become.
[1:51:25.380 --> 1:51:28.940]  They want to force you to wear the mask and take a vaccine because they're totalitarians.
[1:51:28.940 --> 1:51:30.180]  They don't want you to open their business.
[1:51:30.180 --> 1:51:33.900]  They want to be in charge of when it's open or closed because they're totalitarians.
[1:51:33.900 --> 1:51:40.460]  They want to be in charge of your children, your movement, the thermostat in your house,
[1:51:40.460 --> 1:51:42.100]  the gas in your car.
[1:51:42.100 --> 1:51:44.100]  These are totalitarians.
[1:51:44.100 --> 1:51:48.060]  And it looks like maybe some of these libs that just kind of went along with the cause
[1:51:48.060 --> 1:51:52.020]  to the lab are having the remorse and feeling bad.
[1:51:52.020 --> 1:51:55.220]  And they won't be totally honest about it for their own pride.
[1:51:55.220 --> 1:52:00.740]  But it does look like they're beginning to take some steps back in some remorse of promoting
[1:52:00.740 --> 1:52:05.740]  the new world order totalitarianism.
[1:52:05.740 --> 1:52:08.500]  Here's kind of an example of the nonsense, though.
[1:52:08.500 --> 1:52:13.980]  Judge takes action on virtually unintelligible lawsuit against Trump and Israel and it's Palestinians
[1:52:13.980 --> 1:52:17.620]  that fire this lawsuit and it's complete garbage.
[1:52:17.620 --> 1:52:19.580]  And look, we deal with similar stuff here.
[1:52:19.580 --> 1:52:24.700]  Well, they'll file lawsuits against us and it's like they use people's names that never
[1:52:24.700 --> 1:52:26.700]  worked here or haven't worked here in years.
[1:52:26.700 --> 1:52:28.220]  They miss spell names.
[1:52:28.220 --> 1:52:30.380]  They get people's identities confused.
[1:52:30.380 --> 1:52:32.500]  And it's just total dribble and garbage.
[1:52:32.500 --> 1:52:36.540]  But see, Democrat judges will still hear it.
[1:52:36.540 --> 1:52:39.420]  But that's basically what this Palestinian group tried to do to Trump and Israel.
[1:52:39.420 --> 1:52:41.140]  He's like, I don't even understand this lawsuit.
[1:52:41.140 --> 1:52:42.640]  Throw it out.
[1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:44.460]  Democrat judges will hear it, though.
[1:52:44.460 --> 1:52:48.500]  More bad news for Cuomo.
[1:52:48.500 --> 1:52:52.660]  More bad news for Cuomo is this thing going to blow up.
[1:52:52.660 --> 1:52:57.300]  From the Washington examiner, coronavirus infects 10,300 New York group home workers
[1:52:57.300 --> 1:53:04.380]  killing 32 and it actually says it killed hundreds later on in the article.
[1:53:04.380 --> 1:53:07.420]  So I'm a little confused at the headline.
[1:53:07.420 --> 1:53:11.460]  The New York office for people with developmental disabilities, which operates the group homes,
[1:53:11.460 --> 1:53:17.460]  also reported 552 resident deaths and 6,382 infections.
[1:53:17.460 --> 1:53:23.660]  So they have the nursing homes that COVID got sent into by Cuomo.
[1:53:23.660 --> 1:53:33.220]  Now they realize Cuomo also sent the COVID into these developmental disabilities homes,
[1:53:33.220 --> 1:53:36.740]  killing state workers and killing people with mental disabilities.
[1:53:36.740 --> 1:53:47.620]  So my goodness, the numbers of death, the New York nursing home slayer, Andrew Cuomo,
[1:53:47.620 --> 1:53:52.920]  the number of death on his name, on his tally, I mean, he's up there with some of the biggest
[1:53:52.920 --> 1:53:55.180]  tyrants of all time now.
[1:53:55.180 --> 1:53:56.980]  Wow.
[1:53:56.980 --> 1:54:01.100]  But he'll get brought down by some groping allegations or some harassment allegations.
[1:54:01.100 --> 1:54:02.900]  He's fighting them tooth and nail.
[1:54:02.900 --> 1:54:10.660]  And now I'm wondering if the only reason why Cuomo is going slug for slug with the harassment
[1:54:10.660 --> 1:54:14.620]  complaints is because he knows more is going to come out about the COVID deaths that he
[1:54:14.620 --> 1:54:20.980]  caused and so he wants all of that to come out first until the harassment allegations
[1:54:20.980 --> 1:54:22.860]  bring him down.
[1:54:22.860 --> 1:54:25.020]  He's slick if that's the case.
[1:54:25.020 --> 1:54:27.220]  House Democrats draw the line.
[1:54:27.220 --> 1:54:30.060]  They want no cooperation with any Republicans that question the election.
[1:54:30.060 --> 1:54:32.020]  Yeah, you're not allowed to question the election.
[1:54:32.020 --> 1:54:33.220]  You're not allowed to be a free thinker.
[1:54:33.220 --> 1:54:35.820]  But oh, Russian collusion was the biggest story ever.
[1:54:35.820 --> 1:54:39.820]  They spent millions of dollars investigating that, all the media propaganda on that.
[1:54:39.820 --> 1:54:42.380]  It was total fake news.
[1:54:42.380 --> 1:54:47.420]  U.S. National Guard soldier dies while stationed at U.S. Capitol as many are being poisoned
[1:54:47.420 --> 1:54:50.380]  with undercooked food and metal shavings in their food.
[1:54:50.380 --> 1:54:52.060]  It's a total disaster.
[1:54:52.060 --> 1:54:57.400]  It's all Democrat party politics and it's killing people and they don't care.
[1:54:57.400 --> 1:54:58.900]  They like it.
[1:54:58.900 --> 1:55:01.180]  They love when someone dies from their policies.
[1:55:01.180 --> 1:55:04.060]  It makes them feel in charge.
[1:55:04.060 --> 1:55:08.580]  And Lloyd Austin said we will not be removing the National Guard from D.C. even though the
[1:55:08.580 --> 1:55:10.940]  National Guard said there's no point in us being here.
[1:55:10.940 --> 1:55:14.900]  It's going to cost us half a billion dollars a year if we continue to do this.
[1:55:14.900 --> 1:55:16.380]  Well, they love that.
[1:55:16.380 --> 1:55:19.020]  Meanwhile, Biden still yet to have a press conference.
[1:55:19.020 --> 1:55:20.860]  Won't even take questions from the media.
[1:55:20.860 --> 1:55:23.460]  They cut off his camera when he says he will.
[1:55:23.460 --> 1:55:26.660]  He asked for Pelosi's permission or he just says what am I supposed to do?
[1:55:26.660 --> 1:55:27.820]  I don't know what I'm doing here.
[1:55:27.820 --> 1:55:28.940]  And then they cut the feed.
[1:55:28.940 --> 1:55:33.740]  50 days as president, Biden still has not given a news conference.
[1:55:33.740 --> 1:55:34.740]  Critics and allies wonder why.
[1:55:34.740 --> 1:55:36.220]  Well, the allies are starting to wonder why.
[1:55:36.220 --> 1:55:38.780]  The critics know why.
[1:55:38.780 --> 1:55:42.900]  Trump had, I think, five by now, Obama had three by now, Bush had three by now, Obama
[1:55:42.900 --> 1:55:45.620]  had, I mean, everybody does the press conference.
[1:55:45.620 --> 1:55:48.620]  Biden won't even take a question from the media and we all know why.
[1:55:48.620 --> 1:55:50.060]  There's no secret here.
[1:55:50.060 --> 1:55:54.100]  Biden at the very minimum is suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's.
[1:55:54.100 --> 1:56:00.220]  And he can't be trusted on a public microphone.
[1:56:00.220 --> 1:56:03.540]  So Trump gets censored from Twitter because he speaks the truth.
[1:56:03.540 --> 1:56:08.380]  Biden gets censored from talking to the media because he can't speak.
[1:56:08.380 --> 1:56:12.580]  So it's a total clown show.
[1:56:12.580 --> 1:56:17.860]  And we'll see how long Biden can go without having to answer questions from the media.
[1:56:17.860 --> 1:56:22.460]  But remember when Saki was asked why Biden won't address questions from the media, what
[1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:23.460]  did she say?
[1:56:23.460 --> 1:56:25.460]  Well, there's too many national crises going on.
[1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:27.780]  No, that's exactly when you address the media.
[1:56:27.780 --> 1:56:28.780]  Isn't that ironic?
[1:56:28.780 --> 1:56:32.380]  Okay, by the way, Meghan Markle says she wants to run for president now.
[1:56:32.380 --> 1:56:33.380]  Have you heard this?
[1:56:33.380 --> 1:56:39.020]  Yes, Meghan Markle wants to run for president now, married to the fake Prince Harry, which
[1:56:39.020 --> 1:56:43.180]  it does appear, I mean, I don't want to jump the shark, but it does appear that there was
[1:56:43.180 --> 1:56:51.140]  actually the son of Princess Diana's horse-riding instructor, but I'm not going to get too conspiratorial
[1:56:51.140 --> 1:56:52.140]  on that.
[1:56:52.140 --> 1:56:57.460]  But the fake Prince Harry married to the briefcase model, Meghan Markle, who gave it all up to
[1:56:57.460 --> 1:57:01.220]  be a princess, a fake princess, but didn't get what she wanted.
[1:57:01.220 --> 1:57:03.580]  And so now he's trying to destroy the royal family.
[1:57:03.580 --> 1:57:06.920]  And she thinks she can run for office too, by the way, that's hilarious.
[1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:14.740]  But she promotes a yogurt company on the Oprah Winfrey interview, Humphrey Yogurt.
[1:57:14.740 --> 1:57:18.020]  People look into this, and guys, go ahead and look at this logo, and I'm sure it's just
[1:57:18.020 --> 1:57:24.980]  a coincidence that the pedophile logo is in the Meghan Markle frozen yogurt company
[1:57:24.980 --> 1:57:25.980]  that she promoted.
[1:57:25.980 --> 1:57:29.540]  I'm sure that's just a coincidence, so please don't make a big fuss about that.
[1:57:29.540 --> 1:57:35.180]  Meanwhile, the COVID relief bill, $2 trillion, did you know inside that bill is relief for
[1:57:35.180 --> 1:57:39.300]  farmers, but only if you're a farmer of color.
[1:57:39.300 --> 1:57:44.340]  So white farmers get nothing, everybody else gets at least $5 billion in aid.
[1:57:44.340 --> 1:57:48.180]  Wow, Harrison Smith coming up with Sunday Night Live.
