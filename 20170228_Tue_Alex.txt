[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.000]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about growing up in White House.
[00:26.000 --> 00:33.000]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  You are dying to my life! You are dying to my life!
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  From the floodlines of the Info-River, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  No!
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  You want to talk? You want to talk?
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please almost stop.
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  The social engineers are in overdrive trying to start a civil war.
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  Even the French news agency and the Associated Press admit that the United States, but also France
[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  and many other nations of the world are in a civil war against globalism.
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  We've really come a long way, haven't we, from them denying there was a private corporate global government
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  to now having to admit it right out in the open.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away from the broadcast today.
[01:47.000 --> 01:55.000]  I like to swim in cold water. We were out hiking Sunday, myself and some friends and one of my daughters.
[01:55.000 --> 02:02.000]  And there's been a lot of rains lately, and Barton Creek was really flowing pretty fast and full.
[02:02.000 --> 02:11.000]  And I got in the water and swam around for a while, and then booms were having a big earache, sore throat yesterday.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  And it's just one of my little susceptible things that obviously shouldn't be swimming in the creek,
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  even if it looks totally clean in the middle of a city because there's a lot of runoff and a lot of bacteria.
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  But I have guzzled starting last night of the colloidal silver.
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.000]  I think I'm already turned to the corner, but the reason I raised that is I sound a little bit deeper voice today
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  or talk a little bit slower or have to go to videos here and there.
[02:33.000 --> 02:40.000]  It's because everybody's experienced, I think, a Eustacean tube being closed and an airache and a sore throat.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  That's a little bacteria, munch on your throat.
[02:45.000 --> 02:52.000]  Again, I'm just throwing that out there because I almost stayed home, but just there's too much news.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  Plus, I'm going to come back tonight with a lot of the crew.
[02:55.000 --> 03:02.000]  And we're going to do an hour of coverage before the Trump address to Joint Congress.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  And then we're also going to have about an hour of analysis and phone calls from you after that.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  There'll be a big page posted at the front page of infowars.com with our feed, a YouTube feed, a Facebook feed,
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  and then audio feeds as well.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  And of course, our affiliates are welcome to pick up the feed and it will be family-friendly.
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  I've gotten so wild fighting the globalists and so teleprompter-free that occasionally we always delay it out.
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  I've said some things I shouldn't have and I'm really making conscious effort not to do that anymore.
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  It's just that things have gotten so wild, it's really hard to hold back sometimes,
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  and I think a lot of you can also probably register with that.
[03:41.000 --> 03:51.000]  There was a story in Spin Magazine that basically said Alex Jones is a bootlicking scumbag
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.000]  who worships the government now because he supports Trump so much.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  Now, I'm not part of the establishment because we have a president in office being attacked from all sides,
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  big corporations, foreign countries, you name it.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  He is anti-establishment.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  That's why the entire establishment, Hollywood, MSM, everything is against him.
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  The big banks, you name it.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  Now, there was the headline.
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.000]  I found it quickly.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  The job crew, they find stuff so fast, faster than I could.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  I turned conspiracy king Alex Jones into a government bootlegger.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  No, I want a constitutional republic back so I don't have to be enemies with the government.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  That's what I'm talking about in prosperity.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  But that's the type of disinformation and garbage that they spew.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  When we come back, we're going to cover it all in a whole bunch of clips
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  and we've got a bunch of guests on today as well.
[04:47.000 --> 04:56.000]  I'll be telling you about on the other side of this break and again, we have Trump addressing Congress tonight at 8 o'clock central.
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.000]  We're going to kick off coverage at 7 o'clock central infowars.com for our show.
[05:01.000 --> 05:08.000]  If you think that chicken sandwich you ordered at Subway did not fully taste like foul, you may have been right.
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  Ashley Beckford here for infowars.com.
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  A DNA test shows Subway's oven roasted chicken is only 50% chicken.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  Well, this is out of CBS LA.
[05:18.000 --> 05:26.000]  According to a Canadian study, a DNA test showed only half of Subway's oven roasted patty is made with real chicken.
[05:26.000 --> 05:33.000]  Subway was among five fast food restaurants whose chicken the Canadian Broadcast Corporation had tested.
[05:33.000 --> 05:39.000]  The Subway sandwich chain has refuted the results of the DNA test in a release statement.
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  In case you're wondering what the heck was in the rest of those patties and chicken strips, it's soy.
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  Multiple studies have shown eating soy products can cause males to develop gynecomastia.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  That's right guys, male breasts and summers coming.
[05:55.000 --> 06:23.000]  Fight the information war and buy super male vitality at infowarsstore.com.
[06:23.000 --> 06:29.000]  Caveman is those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  From the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[06:47.000 --> 06:54.000]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were.
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.000]  And this is a big part of it.
[06:55.000 --> 07:20.000]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at infowarslife.com today.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  And there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[07:25.000 --> 07:34.000]  In our quest for the purest iodine we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine.
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  On top of that we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  It is the purest cleanest strongest out there.
[07:41.000 --> 07:54.000]  And frankly I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[07:54.000 --> 08:20.000]  This is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the infowarslife family of incredible products.
[08:20.000 --> 08:29.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he. Live from the infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones.
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  Well President 45 is set to make his biggest speech yet.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  In joint address to congress we'll have live coverage at infowars.com forward slash show.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  We'll have the different video players there.
[08:40.000 --> 08:50.000]  You can email your friends and neighbors and family and help spread the transmission viral as we have an hour of news and live analysis before the kickoff at 8 o'clock central.
[08:50.000 --> 08:58.000]  And then we'll have at least an hour of live coverage in your phone calls after historic speech as well.
[08:58.000 --> 09:08.000]  Wow there is obviously just a cornucopia of vitally important news to get to and to cover here today.
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  Trump to tell poorest communities help is on the way.
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  Hasbro to make Play-Doh American again.
[09:17.000 --> 09:25.000]  They've announced that via the push of Trump they're moving back through having the Play-Doh produced here in the United States.
[09:25.000 --> 09:36.000]  Consumer confidence soars the 15 year high according to Business Insider and the federal numbers that were just released from the conference board consumer confidence index.
[09:36.000 --> 09:43.000]  In fact small business startups and other numbers of the highest is the Reagan recovery of 1984.
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  Meanwhile every major globalist institution.
[09:47.000 --> 09:55.000]  Is pushing with everything they've got to plunge the stock market and to kill this recovery.
[09:55.000 --> 10:02.000]  And you see all these poor people that are buying into mainstream media and buying into Stephen Colbert and.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  All the rest of the disinformation agents out there really think it's trendy and cool to attack Trump and hope he fails.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  And that's why they're poor.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  That's why they're disenfranchised.
[10:13.000 --> 10:14.000]  That's why they're stupid.
[10:14.000 --> 10:26.000]  They're getting their news from big corporate comedians who have a whole team of writers filling teleprompters with disinformation and holding up signs to tell the audience to clap.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  When they say how dare Trump criticize the media.
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  I mean you talk about stage you talk about fake you talk about disingenuous it's a joke.
[10:37.000 --> 10:47.000]  As Trump according to every basic benchmark of economics tries to create a level playing field for the average person and tries to flood.
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  Small businesses with very very low interest rate loans and just so much more.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  Trying to cut the price of energy.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  Everything Trump's doing is tangible and real.
[10:58.000 --> 11:05.000]  So of course I have a clip coming up later if we should just play it now where Nancy Pelosi says he has no jobs built.
[11:05.000 --> 11:12.000]  In another daughtering press conference like the one she had two weeks ago when she keeps talking about George W. Bush and how he's a horrible president and how.
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  You know he's trying to deport all the illegals no no that was eight years ago sweetheart.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  And then waters again comes up and says Putin has invaded.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  Korea.
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  Well she's back so let's just go to that clip first because it illustrates what we're dealing with.
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  Let's go to Nancy Pelosi says Trump has no jobs bill.
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.000]  Here it is.
[11:34.000 --> 11:40.000]  Are there any issues where you feel you can still work with the president back in November you talked about infrastructure.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  Talked about perhaps a trillion dollar infrastructure plan.
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.000]  We don't know if he's going to propose one on Tuesday is that something Democrats can get.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  Well let's just talk about that for a moment because I call him the deflector in chief.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  He has no jobs bill.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  I talked about President Obama in the first four weeks four million job.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  He has no jobs bill so he's got to talk about the press.
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  He has no jobs bill so he has to talk about kids transgender kids in school.
[12:07.000 --> 12:15.000]  He has no jobs bill so he has to talk about immigrants and and have a ban on Muslims coming to the country.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  So all of this is a deflection from the fact he has done nothing.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  So that's enough.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  We haven't seen a job.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  What you're seeing is total projection.
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  Obama didn't create four million jobs in his first few months in office.
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  Trump is going forward with a giant infrastructure piece of legislation.
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.000]  He's already signed an executive order to kill the forced provision of Obamacare and the $5,000 fines.
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.000]  He's already said we're going to turn our coal power plants back on that creates massive amounts of jobs and cuts prices in electricity.
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  It makes us more competitive.
[12:52.000 --> 13:04.000]  He's already gotten Ford and Chrysler and Toyota and everybody else to announce they're going to move factories to the United States that were overseas.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  He's already gotten Carrier and Play-Doh that I just mentioned a few minutes ago.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  I mean there are so many companies and so many jobs coming back.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  It's being announced every day.
[13:17.000 --> 13:30.000]  Japan announced $100 billion of investment for this year inside the United States in high-tech development jobs and the list goes on and on and on.
[13:30.000 --> 13:43.000]  We've seen a $2 trillion, $200 billion increase in the biggest run of the stock market again since 1984.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  Here's the clip.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  Now is gaining 15 points.
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.000]  As I said, this is now the 12th record in a row.
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  The last time we saw that, 30 years ago, January 20th of 1987.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  That is also a record for the S&P 500.
[14:00.000 --> 14:09.000]  The Trump boost continues and of course the Atlanta Fed predicted that the GDP for Q1 will come in at 2.5%.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  So David and Melissa, some decent news here.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  All right, a dozen days of records.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  The Dow ending the day at a brand new high for the 12th day in a row.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  The most consecutive records in 30 years.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  Just one more and we make history.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  New record close to the S&P 500 as well.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  All of the major averages ending higher.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  Okay.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  Now here's the key to all of this and I'm about to cover right now.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  Why they're so desperate.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  Chronic capitalists admit they want a managed controlled economy where they picked the winners and losers.
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  Everybody knows that.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  Ron Paul talked about it 30 years ago.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  I talked about it 20 years ago.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  The general public didn't even understand those type of terms.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  Now it's ubiquitous.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  Pretty much everybody understands that the big global corporate combines are tax exempt.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  They control the governments.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  They pick winners and losers.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  But from Iceland to Spain, from Greece to Italy, from Brazil to the United States to Australia.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  And many other places.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  I mentioned Iceland.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  One of the first to do it.
[15:13.000 --> 15:19.000]  They're saying, why are there one sided deals to transfer our jobs and sell off our steel mills and sell off our industry?
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  And we're supposed to have service jobs and even that gets sold off.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  We don't want this.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  And so there's an article in the AFP today.
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  French election turns ugly as political attacks mount.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  And they admit that there is a civil war against globalism happening.
[15:35.000 --> 15:42.000]  There's another article today about two visions for America and tonight's Trump speech to Congress.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  Americanism versus globalism.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  So they don't even deny now this is what's happening.
[15:46.000 --> 15:53.000]  But you go out to the local leftist rallies and they're screaming and yelling that Trump hates gay people.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  They're screaming and yelling, you know, that he wants to basically kill Mexicans or something.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  They're screaming and yelling all these things that aren't true.
[16:02.000 --> 16:09.000]  They're total distractions and it's the big corporate media from Colbert and the fake, you know, newscast that he does.
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  Admittedly fake newscast where he calls us fake to CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  They're all working against the American people.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  But still the American people are aware of it.
[16:20.000 --> 16:21.000]  What's blown up in their face.
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.000]  So here's the key.
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  Consumer confidence soars a 15 year high.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  We've got the best small business numbers since 1984.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  Same thing with stock market.
[16:30.000 --> 16:38.000]  Look at this GDP for Q4 holds at 1.9 despite consumer spending jump because the deindustrialization was so bad.
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  We were supposed to be going into a depression this year.
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  That's why this is neck and neck folks.
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  You better hope Trump succeeds because he'll be fine.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  The rest of us are not going to do so well if this thing goes belly up.
[16:51.000 --> 16:57.000]  I've got numbers on that with top economists saying if this goes belly up and Trump fails like Ron Paul said here a month ago,
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  it is going to be a gigantic depression in many areas.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  Here's the key.
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  This is the key from Bloomberg News telling the truth.
[17:07.000 --> 17:15.000]  Bloomberg itself and Michael Bloomberg's bad-bouncing Trump saying things are in collapse saying it out of stock market.
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  JPMorgan Goldman Sachs, they're all betting against Trump and betting against America because they just want to have a controlled system.
[17:21.000 --> 17:31.000]  But they have to admit that this isn't a rally on the stock market caused by the big banks even though they're getting a lion's share of the money in some cases.
[17:31.000 --> 17:42.000]  No, despite them trying to block Trump Goldman Sachs has made what is it 36% was 33% more just since he got in office 40 something days ago.
[17:42.000 --> 17:50.000]  They've made hundreds of billions of dollars and they're trying to block it because see they don't want you to have anything.
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  So much wealth getting produced and she says he has no jobs bill.
[17:54.000 --> 18:00.000]  What do you think a trillion that's the bill in the next decade of infrastructure spending does that's jobs.
[18:00.000 --> 18:09.000]  What do you think a 50 plus billion dollar increase in defense spending which isn't really that big quite frankly compared to what you know some increases have been but it's in targeted areas.
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  That's a jobs bill.
[18:10.000 --> 18:19.000]  What do you think any of this is jobs, jobs, jobs as he said help is on the way but she responds hoping that people watching ABC News are idiots.
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  When it comes to the basic economics.
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  Here's the key Bloomberg has to admit this mom and pop investors are behind this historic market rally.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  It's the small stocks the medium stocks are driving the big stocks.
[18:32.000 --> 18:43.000]  And it's the overall spending and outlaying and people purchasing cars and boats and houses that also hiring more people believing in America and putting everything down on the line like I'm doing.
[18:43.000 --> 18:52.000]  Despite the fact we're under censorship attack Google banning us via ad role from advertising on the Internet basically all sorts of other behind the scenes attacks that I won't go into.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  I'm going I decided not just hire 1520 more people this year.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  I'm going to try to hire like 30 or 40 to be.
[18:57.000 --> 19:03.000]  I joked instead of hundreds the other day we can't do that we're only like 65 people and in full wars but I want to go next level.
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  I really want to put everything in now because history is happening.
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.000]  It's an amazing time but this is this is your rally.
[19:10.000 --> 19:18.000]  This is mom and pops who are black who are white who are Hispanic who are just human beings who are working together and believing.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  And the globalist cannot stand it.
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  They want to replace everybody with robots.
[19:23.000 --> 19:29.000]  They want to bring in minimum wages so high that you can't compete in America and you got to go to China or Mexico.
[19:29.000 --> 19:39.000]  That's why the big globalists are always pushing a minimum wage hike of $15 $18 because here it is Wendy's replacing 1000 of its employees with robots as we speak.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  Because a minimum wage is already going up many areas.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  Some states passing laws.
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  So again this all sounds good to understand economics.
[19:47.000 --> 19:56.000]  It's like taxes they have of making you know a six pack of Coca Cola 10 bucks and then sales plunged by almost half because people aren't going to pay for that.
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  This is how economics works.
[19:58.000 --> 20:10.000]  They'll be back with huge news.
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.000]  Maybe not today.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  But soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  Forget bunkers.
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  You need survivalist camps.

[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  Hi this is Ron Paul.
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.000]  I am a former congressman physician and presidential candidate.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  The world is in turmoil.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars and famines are commonplace.
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  As Americans we are largely sheltered from these events.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  However in parts of the world just having enough food is a huge problem.
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.000]  For some of us there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.000]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  It's a home freeze dryer from harvest right.
[22:31.000 --> 22:35.000]  With it we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat and it lasts up to twenty five years.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  Who knows what the future will bring.
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  One thing certain my family and I will always have food on the table.
[22:47.000 --> 22:54.000]  To learn more go to harvest right dot com or call eight hundred seven six three five nine nine nine.

[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  Individual share amounts begin at one hundred seven dollars a month and three hundred forty seven for families.

[23:20.000 --> 23:21.000]  See guidelines.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  Discount programs available for dental, vision and pharmacy.

[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  That's libertyoncall.org.
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  This is Dan Billard.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  I've defended people from the IRS for over thirty years.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  Call eight hundred thirty four no tax to finally get free of IRS debt.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  With the IRS's new programs there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  Call eight hundred thirty four no tax.
[23:54.000 --> 23:59.000]  That's eight hundred three four no tax or my website danpilla.com.
[23:59.000 --> 24:17.000]  Coming up in the next segment we're going to break down incredible instances of censorship taking place.
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  We almost had our YouTube channel that's got a billion two hundred million views.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  Just one of our YouTube channels down and I knew when I saw the video this weekend that we'd be facing this.
[24:27.000 --> 24:36.000]  It's several large women at the LGBTQ rally coming up to Millie Weaver is being totally nice to them.
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  And saying we're going to basically beat you up if you don't delete footage of us.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  But they're at a public event.
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  There's no perception of privacy when you're at a rally.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  And you know by the Capitol.
[24:51.000 --> 24:59.000]  And they were so threatening she deleted that but actually shot footage of them coming over and getting in her face and it's the entitlement.
[24:59.000 --> 25:07.000]  Sure enough they filed complaints with YouTube and tried or someone acting for them did and then YouTube said no this doesn't violate our policies we're not going to do it.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  I'm going to show you this just the entitlement is like unbelievable.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  It's like the new royalty or something.
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000]  And again I don't care if these women like women or whatever I'm not getting into that.
[25:18.000 --> 25:26.000]  It's that we're going out to show what spoiled rotten babies these people are and they never cease to deliver an amaze.
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  And some of the folks I mean it's quite frankly like out of a horror movie.
[25:30.000 --> 25:36.000]  I don't mean that mean but you know six four guys with day of the dead white paint on their face with big red wigs.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  Man that's scary devil's reject stuff and they're trying to be shocking.
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.000]  It's like a bunch of people that were you know failed arts you know theater class people or something.
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.000]  You know they want to just be in theater and act funny and act weird.
[25:50.000 --> 25:57.000]  That's fine but don't try to teach our five year olds you know how to behave and don't try to come in showers with girls.
[25:57.000 --> 26:04.000]  That's all Trump or I or anybody saying this is a very nice report we put out.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  And of course the entitlement is we want to take you down.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  We're so entitled we're going to go to a public event.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  We're going to threaten people and then we're going to say you can't show that.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  Wow.
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.000]  So that's kind of ties in to PewDiePie who has I was saying 46 million subscribers.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  I'm sorry it's 50 plus million subscribers.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  Billions and billions of views a year.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  The biggest thing on YouTube.
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  The guy was raking in I think was $10 million in 2013.
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  Who knows what it is now.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  Okay.
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  And this guy's got more viewers every day than CNN and MSNBC combined conservatively.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  53 million subscribers.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  He plays some of our clips on there.
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.000]  He's welcome to.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  We want the publicity.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  We want to reach out to young people.
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.000]  You know one of my daughters at school.
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  He's the big rock star.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  They'll watch him.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  They're not supposed to.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  There's a little bit of raciness there.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  But the point is they were trying to ban him as a racist.
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  And Paul Watson did a report.
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.000]  But that just shows where all this is going.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  By all yardsticks I'd call the guy kind of a libertarian liberal.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  He's not a conservative but they want him banned because he made Hitler jokes.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  So did Charlie Chaplin.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  You know I did a Hitler dog video with my dog captain.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  He has a Hitler moustache.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  He doesn't have any hair on his lip.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  It's black.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  He has white fur.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  And they try to take that video down a few years ago saying it's Nazi.
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  Let the Nazis have their stuff as long as they're not calling for violence.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  If you don't do that you'll lose all free speech.
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  In fact we're just going to start covering this now and I'm going to come back and get into all that.
[27:39.000 --> 27:42.000]  Then I'm going to get into Russia.
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  And the rest of it, you know, Devin Nunes, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee,
[27:47.000 --> 27:53.000]  has come out and told reporters yesterday that there's no ties to Russia that have been found.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  They look.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  They're not even phone calls until he's president-elect.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  And then he starts making calls.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  They announce the Russians recorded the calls and put out transcripts.
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  That's what a president does with his transition team.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  But they made this huge much to do about nothing.
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  They cover that as well coming up.
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  And it's just like Trump told us months ago and told us last week in a press conference,
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  this whole Russia thing is a ruse.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  And now Rand Paul has credit.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  I'm glad to see these guys are working together again.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  That's really good.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  I like Rand Paul a lot.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  Investigating Trump's Russia ties driven by hysteria.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  House Intelligence Chair denies evidence of Trump's team's ties to Russia.
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  While Flynn resigns, he can make 10 times the money easily, you know, working places like Jones Group.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  I know for a fact, he turned down a super lucrative job at the Jones Group
[28:45.000 --> 28:51.000]  in international security and consulting that was 10 times what he'd be paid as national security advisor.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  He's just like, you know what?
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.000]  Call me a Russian agent, former head of defense intelligence.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  I'm done.
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  Okay.
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  I'm done.
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  Just enjoy yourselves, America.
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  Thanks a lot for, you know, going out and stopping Al Qaeda and ISIS, you know.
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  Geez.
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  So there you go.
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  So good for General Flynn.
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  You know what I mean?
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.000]  It's almost like the American people don't deserve patriots like that that actually work their butts off and care about the country.
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  But say la vie.
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  There's another big report here where deep state war, Russia officials keep dying unexpectedly.
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.000]  These are all allies of Putin.
[29:23.000 --> 29:29.000]  And it's definitely a Western war trying to push Putin into some type of provocative action.
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  It's big.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  We're going to look at that.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Maybe Darya, who speaks Russian, can read these words.
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  Well, these names can go over this with me.
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.000]  So I don't, uh, Vitaly Churkin, Peter, Polish, Kov.
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  I'm getting these right.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  We'll talk about that coming up too.
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  This is the info war.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  And I'm going to tell you about the guests we've got as well today.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  A bunch of guests.
[29:50.000 --> 30:02.000]  Stay with us.
[30:02.000 --> 30:08.000]  If you think that chicken sandwich you ordered at Subway did not fully taste like foul, you may have been right.
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  Ashley Beckford here for info wars.com.
[30:11.000 --> 30:16.000]  A DNA test shows Subway's oven roasted chicken is only 50% chicken.
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  Well, this is out of CBS LA.
[30:18.000 --> 30:27.000]  According to a Canadian study, a DNA test showed only half of Subway's oven roasted patty is made with real chicken.
[30:27.000 --> 30:33.000]  Subway was among five fast food restaurants whose chicken the Canadian broadcast corporation had tested.
[30:33.000 --> 30:39.000]  The Subway sandwich chain has refuted the results of the DNA test in a release statement.
[30:39.000 --> 30:44.000]  In case you're wondering what the heck was in the rest of those patties and chicken strips, it's soy.
[30:44.000 --> 30:51.000]  Multiple studies have shown eating soy products can cause males to develop gynecomastia.
[30:51.000 --> 30:55.000]  That's right guys, male breasts and summers coming.

[33:27.000 --> 33:53.000]  We've got our 1776 worldwide background, the globe and the American flag orbiting each other.
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  You're a TV viewer at infowarst.com for this last show.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  Tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  We'll have a live info wars nightly news.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  We'll cover Trump's historic first speech to Congress.
[34:05.000 --> 34:13.000]  And then we will go right into analysis after that and open up the phone systems and take some of your phone calls.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  We'll also take some phone calls today.
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  Let me tell you about some of the guests that are coming up.
[34:18.000 --> 34:27.000]  We're going to have Millie Weaver in studio with us, with Gavin, who is the camera guy out there with her.
[34:27.000 --> 34:33.000]  When this weekend, they simply went to the LGBTQ Queer Fest, as it's called.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  We couldn't even call it that on YouTube because they'd ban us for sure.
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.000]  See, because only the city of Austin and these groups can call themselves the Queer Fest.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  And we're not supposed to call them by their actual name or we're hateful.
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  See how these special games work because they're the bosses, they're in control.
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.000]  They're a bunch of spoiled brats, whether they were heterosexual or whatever they were, just acting like a bunch of control freaks.
[34:53.000 --> 35:06.000]  And then complaining to YouTube, trying to take down the video, saying we were at their event in their privacy when they were in public in front of the Capitol, across the street from the Capitol and the governor's mansion.
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  So Millie Weaver is going to be in studio to talk about that.
[35:08.000 --> 35:21.000]  Of course, he has huge breaking news dealing with his part two report that's on infowars.com, how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were looted for hundreds of billions of dollars illegally.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  This has come out in federal court by Obama to prop up Obamacare.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  This is huge.
[35:28.000 --> 35:35.000]  And this comes again from our sources directly inside the White House that directed us at the public court cases and information.
[35:35.000 --> 35:42.000]  And then Gerald Solentil will be joining me in the fourth hour or in the third hour and then Owen Troyer is in the fourth hour today.
[35:42.000 --> 35:49.000]  Before I go any further, there was another controversy that ended up being in the Washington Post.
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  And I'm not joking, it had to be over 100 other publications.
[35:52.000 --> 35:59.000]  Because I get Google alerts on my phone and I can just see them and it'll say the number and it was over 100.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  This is how things work because when we make a retraction, we make a retraction.
[36:03.000 --> 36:09.000]  And we're proud to make a retraction because we're always making mistakes like anybody does by accident though.
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  Not on purpose like the mainstream media lying to you and saying Obamacare is free.
[36:13.000 --> 36:26.000]  So of course, he sends me his Obamacare story part one yesterday about Obama looting the federal housing money and the private investors that are inside there.
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  And then those low cost home programs to prop up Obamacare.
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  So I go in there and I say the headline is exclusive and then his article.
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  And I say, oh, and here's talking points that were sent out to conservative libertarians.
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  I'm told by course, this is not broken yet.
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  It's just got sent out.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  And so, you know, put this out and say breaking.
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  And then it did say breaking in the headline, but lower down and said this exclusive list.
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  And then I said at the bottom, this is not a leak.
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  So folks that think I was leaking something that turns into Jones has been deceptive.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  He said he got something exclusively from the White House and he didn't.
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.000]  The point is, we're the first to put out the talking point list of the speech tonight yesterday.
[37:06.000 --> 37:16.000]  And the Washington Post freaked out and ran with it pretty much creating the illusion that that was actually true.
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.000]  They're the ones that kind of did it saying we didn't believe the White House exclusively gave Jones an info wars.
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.000]  These talking points, but sure enough, Spicer gave a press conference and that's exactly what they said and did.
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  So they freaked out and said, okay, it's true.
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  And then that's when everyone went nuts and said, Alex has made this up.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  No, we didn't make it up.
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  There was just one little part on the note at the end that wasn't exactly right.
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  It doesn't matter.
[37:39.000 --> 37:46.000]  I'm not fawning around in Washington like I'm in junior high or high school trying to be cool and trying to go to the stupid correspondence dinner.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  I'm not trying to be in Hollywood.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  I mean, I've been in some big Hollywood films.
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  I've hosted discovery channel and history channel shows.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  I've been offered national TV shows.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  I don't want you.
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  I don't need you.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  I've been offered Fox news shows on record.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  So just get this straight media.
[38:04.000 --> 38:13.000]  I'm not running around fawning at the White House and you guys just constantly try to act like, you know, we're deceiving people as you pick through everything.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  You're a joke.
[38:15.000 --> 38:24.000]  But here it is for a preview of Trump's address to Congress, read info wars really.
[38:24.000 --> 38:40.000]  And it goes on to say info wars website, the Travis conspiracy theories questioning on liars like Jeff Bezos who got 600 million last year to fence it through reportedly into the Washington Post under media companies to put out CIA propaganda and to co locate thousands of giant servers at his home base.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[38:43.000 --> 38:54.000]  Info wars website, the Travis conspiracy theories claim Monday was clicked through an article to have gotten his hands on online outline of President Trump's upcoming address to Congress.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  You're forgiven for being skeptical.
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  After all, this is the site that reported the news that Hillary Clinton is a child murderer.
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  In fact, she is not.
[39:02.000 --> 39:13.000]  It appears, however, that someone in the White House really did provide a preview of Trump speech info wars.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  In some cases during his daily media briefing.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  Let's stop right there.
[39:19.000 --> 39:25.000]  Then it turns into the Hill and everybody else info wars claims exclusive preview of mass emailed Trump address.
[39:25.000 --> 39:32.000]  Wasn't mass emailed since I was told by 20 people and we were getting it first because the guy that was sending it out was giving it to us first.
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  Fine.
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  I'll just go all the way and tell you the whole thing and be like, we were given the first time.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  That's what I'm not going to tell you who did that either.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  I mean, you'd really freak out.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  But I mean, it just never ends.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  It just never ends.
[39:48.000 --> 39:49.000]  People are nice.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  People are friends with Corsi.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  They say, hey, this is going out in an hour.
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  You want it first, we're sent up to the conservative outlets, libertarian outlets.
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  Yeah, please.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Or she says, hey, this is going to go out to like 20 people an hour.
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  You got it first.
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  They want to, you know, give it to you.
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  Boom.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  And I'm not going to say the rest of what he said.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  But the point is, is that they turn it into this whole controversy.
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  It's like Conway was excited.
[40:10.000 --> 40:21.000]  It was wearing little slippers and put her feet up on the couch, taking photos of the congressional caucus that was visiting being a charming lady.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  And they said, oh my God, you've got your feet up on the couch.
[40:23.000 --> 40:34.000]  If you go to infowars.com, there's an article about this, much to about nothing, where we show Obama with his feet on the couch and other people with their feet on the couch and on the desk and on chairs.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  Big deal.
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.000]  And that's because these are not uptight, stuck up weirdos like the globalists we've seen.
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.000]  Conway just jumps up there so she can get a better photo.
[40:48.000 --> 41:01.000]  And everybody acts like it's so weird, but if you go to infowars.com and Paul's article about it, Steve has an article, you can see all the photos of people doing the exact same thing and more.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  Not just Obama kicking his feet up, but other stuff.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  People put them on tables, chairs, you name it.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  That's what you do.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  But this just shows this entirely different standard.
[41:12.000 --> 41:20.000]  Just like you're going to see them attack this address tonight and heckle it, but don't you dare heckle Obama and don't you dare not, you know, only glow.
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  Like it's the best thing in the world when Obama or Bill Clinton did something.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  It's disgusting.
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.000]  So again, I don't want to talk about ourselves here, but that's the type of stuff we deal with.
[41:32.000 --> 41:43.000]  Like we pull up our original article here does breaking bullet points of Trump's congressional address given to info wars breaking, not exclusive.
[41:43.000 --> 41:51.000]  But that's again, how they turn everything into some type of controversy, because that's all they can do.
[41:51.000 --> 41:57.000]  Because they're the discredited people that said Trump could never win.
[41:57.000 --> 42:07.000]  Now, before I go any further, I want to really thank the viewers and listeners and supporters, whether you've prayed for us, whether you've spread the articles and videos, whether you've bought great products from us that help us fund this operation.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  You are the reason info wars is here.
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  You are the info war.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  So know that.
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.000]  And we lost at least $3.3 million last week.
[42:17.000 --> 42:31.000]  That's how much we had extra from ad role Google ads we place to spend a lot of money on, but that was in the black column to then overall fund this operation, not as profit for the overall operation, but an advertising system.
[42:31.000 --> 42:39.000]  We run to then fund the radio show, the TV show, investigative journalists, the camera people, everything we do here.
[42:39.000 --> 42:48.000]  You know, the game changing tip of the spear assault on the globalists that's bringing back the biggest dividends anybody's ever seen from a propaganda outfit.
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.000]  By the way, propaganda just means a political point of view, something that promotes it has negative connotations.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  There's white propaganda, great propaganda and black propaganda.
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.000]  We put out white propaganda.
[43:00.000 --> 43:10.000]  And we are funded by folks that support us. So thank you so much.
[43:10.000 --> 43:18.000]  We didn't make back all of the shortfall that we've made back a little less than half of it in this big drive of the last week and change.
[43:18.000 --> 43:34.000]  So we've been doing this for eight, nine days. And now if you count what we normally would have already brought in, it's more like 600, 700,000 to try to, you know, projecting into 2018, because that was money we made in 2016 to fund ourselves this year, projecting out.
[43:34.000 --> 43:47.000]  We're going to find some other revenue sources without turning this broadcast into a giant infomercial to be able to build this media operation and then again, not just advertise to our own audience but reach out and advertise so that we don't pollute the show.
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  That's what we're doing.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  Most people advertise and then they just keep the money.
[43:52.000 --> 44:01.000]  You know, we advertise outside of this operation, take it in and then use it to fund our operation.
[44:01.000 --> 44:08.000]  I remember when I was trying to help Rush Limbaugh and he was being boycotted six years ago and I spent a quarter million dollars on there in a month advertising some of our films.
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.000]  They almost didn't let us do it.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  They said, oh, you want to be on this show? You want to, I said, fine, don't take the money if you don't want to.
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  They said, okay, you can advertise.
[44:19.000 --> 44:25.000]  I mean, I was literally trying to help somebody.
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  I have that instinct. I mean, I hope if we're under attack, you're going to support us.
[44:28.000 --> 44:36.000]  Not about other talk shows, not just our listeners. I mean, we're going to hang together or hang separate for the First Amendment. It's very, very, very simple.
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  But let me get back to this so much for the news and the clips I've got.
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.000]  There's huge censorship taking place everywhere that I'm about to document further.
[44:45.000 --> 44:56.000]  It's not just us because they can intimidate everybody and intimidate the biggest names like PewDiePie and Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and Donald Trump.
[44:56.000 --> 45:00.000]  If they can get us to kind of roll over and shut up and self-censor, they win.
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.000]  This whole movement is about not being self-censored.
[45:03.000 --> 45:25.000]  So we're going to end the special tomorrow morning where you can get 33% off silver bullet colloidal silver, 25% off supermail volatility, 25% off brain force, survival shield X2, 25% off caveman, ultimate paleob, turmeric and bone broth and more,
[45:25.000 --> 45:33.000]  33% off out of the gates. The Donald J. Trump and Ronald Reagan, one-of-a-kind lithographs. The Trump print is in chocolate ink.
[45:33.000 --> 45:40.000]  The last one was in black ink. The Reagan we've never done before. This is a limited edition. It's only 500 of those.
[45:40.000 --> 45:46.000]  They are selling out. They're $19.95 at an art house. This is the official guy for the Republican Party that does these.
[45:46.000 --> 45:56.000]  An amazing artist. This should be $50 for the print, $100, $200, $200 framed. And when these are done, no more of these prints, even in different variants or different colors.
[45:56.000 --> 46:05.000]  It is a collector's item. It comes in a nice tube. It's numbered and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[46:05.000 --> 46:28.000]  So m4store.com, m4slife.com or 888-2533-139. And finally, I've come up with a new idea for a t-shirt with the crew that I believe will be the next viral t-shirt.
[46:28.000 --> 46:39.000]  Like the t-shirt that sold $100,000 or so? That sounds like a lot. Most of them we sold for $995 or $5, $5 is that cost.
[46:39.000 --> 46:44.000]  There's more that goes into the shirt itself, costs like $5, all the infrastructure and things, probably $6, $7.
[46:44.000 --> 46:51.000]  But the point is, I just wanted to see the shirts everywhere. You responded, you bought four, five, six of them each of the Hillary for President 2016.
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  It took over the narrative last year. It's huge.
[46:55.000 --> 47:03.000]  We now have the Trump Pence 2020 Keeping America Great election shirt with m4wars.com on the right shoulder.
[47:03.000 --> 47:07.000]  It's a navy blue, handsome shirt. Looks great on men and women on the back.
[47:07.000 --> 47:16.000]  It says, America first since 1776, m4wars.com. You want to meet like-minded people?
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  You want to spread the word? You want to exercise the First Amendment?
[47:18.000 --> 47:28.000]  And these bully's faces? You want to help us fund this operation that has millions and millions of dollars in bandwidth costs every quarter alone?
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  I mean, you want somebody to fight? Folks, we're doing it. We're fighting hard. We appreciate your support.
[47:33.000 --> 47:39.000]  We don't have the big corporate sponsors, and I'm not putting them down. It's just true of a PewDiePie, because they're now taken away.
[47:39.000 --> 47:43.000]  PewDiePie is number one on YouTube, billions a year of viewers.
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.000]  But to the globalists want to teach them, you're not part of our structure. You're not going to have any sponsors.
[47:48.000 --> 47:57.000]  We're going to kick you off YouTube next time, because you made fun of Hitler, like Charlie Chaplin or John Cleese.
[47:57.000 --> 48:04.000]  There's a report Paul Watson breaks this down. It's on m4wars.com. PewDiePie ban all things.
[48:04.000 --> 48:14.000]  Well, when they have white chalkboards, white markboards, marker boards in colleges all over the country,
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  as reported last week, being removed because somebody might write something hurtful.
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.000]  That's saying banned books or banned paper because somebody might write something banned language.
[48:23.000 --> 48:31.000]  Well, look at globalism. Look at the language shrinking. Look at what's happening. It's unfolding.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  So Paul dares. He may lose his YouTube channel here.
[48:35.000 --> 48:45.000]  We've already had complaints filed. That was what they're trying to do right now, to take iconography and show PewDiePie in a Nazi uniform as part of the joke,
[48:45.000 --> 48:52.000]  or to show another Hitler dog. I mean, I did Hitler dog four years ago.
[48:52.000 --> 49:03.000]  But again, Charlie Chaplin, he's allowed to, but nobody else is. You know, Disney could have cartoons in World War Two lampooning Hitler.
[49:03.000 --> 49:09.000]  If it's Nazi land so good, we wouldn't change it if we could. Oh, we love it. New World Order.
[49:09.000 --> 49:19.000]  You guys Google or YouTube, Disney anti-Nazi cartoons. I mean, it's Donald Duck fighting Hitler, but those would be banned today
[49:19.000 --> 49:24.000]  because Donald Duck's running around hollering Hitler as a joke in as part of his disguise.
[49:24.000 --> 49:32.000]  But PewDiePie was even clearer. He wasn't with Hitler. It's about the mob of intimidators being able to go around and shut down whoever they want
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  because they're jealous that he gets billions of viewers a year. They're jealous that we have over a billion viewers a year.
[49:38.000 --> 49:43.000]  Clearly, we count all the other channels and people that we let run our videos, hundreds of millions a month.
[49:43.000 --> 49:49.000]  Yeah, here it is. Let's play this with some audio. Let's back this up. This is Disney 1943.
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.000]  Oh, there's no audio on this. Hmm. Well, maybe later we can play it.
[49:54.000 --> 50:03.000]  But the point is, is that I even own the DVD actually, it's back there and like Rob Do's shelf of all the World War Two era propaganda cartoons.
[50:03.000 --> 50:10.000]  I believe is the name of the DVD set. But continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, you are the folks that are funding us
[50:10.000 --> 50:17.000]  and you're the ones that are spreading the word as they start delisting us on Google and driving us down in the ratings even though we're number one.
[50:17.000 --> 50:25.000]  You search info wars as they start to try to block us on Facebook and Twitter as they start to disappear our post as they start to try to remove us off YouTube.
[50:25.000 --> 50:32.000]  As they announced, they're doing this as they ban us from advertising on Google platforms.
[50:32.000 --> 50:41.000]  It's getting bad. They're doing to Bright Bar, they're doing to everybody. As Drudge says, we have to create our own platforms, our own advertising systems and we're going to do it.
[50:41.000 --> 50:57.000]  But let's go ahead and go to PewDiePie because this ties into the next guest in the next hour, Millie Weaver, because we're going to play the video that's bleeped quite a bit as these bullying women.
[50:57.000 --> 51:05.000]  But it's like a trans event. They may want to be men. I mean, it's all just look at me stuff. It's like, I don't care what you're doing.
[51:05.000 --> 51:12.000]  But it's the arrogance of that I've noticed with particularly butch women.
[51:12.000 --> 51:21.000]  I told the story about Shane Steiner's wife who's like a supermodel and we're playing pool one day while the kids are bowling right there at a place called Main Event.
[51:21.000 --> 51:33.000]  The pool tables are right here. The bowling's right here. And young lesbian women but butch with like James Dean, ducks ass hairstyles and white t-shirts with cigarette packs under them.
[51:33.000 --> 51:37.000]  I'm not kidding. Like they're about to drop canes or switch blades are about to come out.
[51:37.000 --> 51:43.000]  Came right up and we're like trying to hit on her and we're hitting on other women and she was just laughing at them.
[51:43.000 --> 51:51.000]  And like, I'm not a little guy but Shane looks like Conan the Barbarian. I mean, literally he could. I've seen him bench press 400 pounds 30 times.
[51:51.000 --> 52:03.000]  He says he can do it 40. The point is, is they literally muscled up. And again, it's this thing. I'm entitled. I'm going to muscle up on your hot blonde wife.
[52:03.000 --> 52:12.000]  I mean, this is cuckoo land folks. And boy, you get a good looking woman at one of these events. These women come flooding in like, you know what?
[52:12.000 --> 52:18.000]  A man threatened a woman like that and said, you better erase that. We're going to, you know, hurt you.
[52:18.000 --> 52:24.000]  It'd be the end of the world. But see, because it's women doing another woman. And by the way, statistically, lesbians.
[52:24.000 --> 52:33.000]  And I'm not passionate lesbians. Okay. I mean, I don't want to. It's a family show. But I mean, I get it. I like women. I just kind of like, you know, I like.
[52:33.000 --> 52:44.000]  They're dead by stakes. You know, you like, you like women, whatever. They have the highest rates, though, of beating each other up and domestic violence. It's fact that there's something going on here in this culture.
[52:44.000 --> 52:54.000]  It's very unhealthy. Camille Pagli is a lesbian. She's written books about that. There's stuff going on here and it's anti male. It's anti woman. It's anti human culture.
[52:54.000 --> 53:07.000]  You can have your culture to stop trying to have a revolution to take ours over here in the tolerant open West because we've allowed you to do whatever you want from pouring bleach in your eyes because you identify as a blind person.
[53:07.000 --> 53:21.000]  Having the government pay for it to millions of sex changes being paid for by taxpayers every year. And now you want to go in the eighth grade girls locker room when you're a senior and go in the showers with them with your Ataconda hanging out.
[53:21.000 --> 53:31.000]  It's just not right. And it's a form of assault and a form of dominance and taking our open society and our kindness for weakness. And it's got to stop.
[53:31.000 --> 53:47.000]  So again, complaints get filed saying you aren't allowed to tape us. You you've exposed our personal information when you're the ones at a public event getting in somebody's face surrounding a little woman, Millie's little big women surrounding them.
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.000]  Like it's the space bar, you know, in Star Wars.
[53:52.000 --> 54:00.000]  You better watch yourself. I have the death sentence on 12 systems. My friend doesn't like you.
[54:00.000 --> 54:05.000]  I don't like you either. I mean, they're literally like thugs.
[54:05.000 --> 54:17.000]  Like a few times when I was younger, be out at bars, some rowdy bars where that's some good rockabilly music and there might be, you know, some bandidos or something, which is a serious outlaw motorcycle gang.
[54:17.000 --> 54:24.000]  And I don't know who you are. You're a clean cut whatever. Just say something. You better watch yourself. You know, you'd be like, serious stuff could happen right there.
[54:24.000 --> 54:32.000]  But this is women coming over to a woman acting like they're in the space bar and it's Luke Skywalker.
[54:32.000 --> 54:38.000]  I mean, you guys are a joke is all I can say. And then you can't handle it. You want to go to public events and getting women's faces.
[54:38.000 --> 54:44.000]  And then we're supposed to do nothing. Here's Paul Watson's report. It's already got several million views just on YouTube alone.
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.000]  And it's also on Facebook. Here it is. It's at infowars.com. Let's tweet it out right now at Real House Jones.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  Pewdiepie ban all things. Here it is.
[54:51.000 --> 55:09.000]  Have you seen the new edition of the regressive left dictionary fascist noun, a person who disagrees with my opinion?
[55:09.000 --> 55:21.000]  Neo-Nazis. Noun. A person who makes jokes about Nazis. So Pewdiepie is commanding an internet troll army of Neo-Nazis because he made a Hitler joke, which you took completely out of context.
[55:26.000 --> 55:33.000]  You people never fail to disappoint, do you? I guess we better exhume the body of Charlie Chaplin and charge him with hate crimes.
[55:33.000 --> 55:40.000]  I guess we better lock up John Cleese and throw away the key. JK Rowling says Pewdiepie is trivializing fascism.
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.000]  No, you're the one trivializing fascism when you call everyone a fascist.
[55:45.000 --> 55:51.000]  Over a frigging joke. You've destroyed the meaning of the word. You've obliterated nuance.
[55:51.000 --> 55:58.000]  But Rowling says the Neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer loves Pewdiepie. So that must make him a Neo-Nazi, right?
[55:58.000 --> 56:11.000]  Yeah, it doesn't quite work like that. And isn't it rich that the same mainstream media who constantly whine about Trump shutting down free speech is now crucifying Pewdiepie in a unified effort to shut down free speech?
[56:11.000 --> 56:12.000]  Choose.
[56:12.000 --> 56:31.000]  Here's the thing. Regressives have almost succeeded in making Facebook and Twitter sterile safe spaces, and now they're coming after YouTube.
[56:31.000 --> 56:46.000]  Look at this Reddit thread. Look how panicked they are about Pewdiepie.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  It's scary because these people have huge influence on kids and it seems that YouTube itself has turned right.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  Yeah, YouTube has really turned right because Casey-
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  I will be voting for Hillary Clinton.
[56:55.000 --> 57:01.000]  Nice stat is really right wing. It's all going to back end. The self-proclaimed li-
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  Let's back it up for a second because I'm going to come out in the next segment by the rest of it, but listen.
[57:04.000 --> 57:12.000]  What's happening here? You notice they say, we've got to ban this because this is really popular. That's what it's really all about.
[57:12.000 --> 57:22.000]  So you make your little safe spaces and what they admit are mental illness induction centers at the colleges to create wrecked, confused, dysfunctional people getting worthless degrees.
[57:22.000 --> 57:32.000]  This is all declassified. And then you come off your safe spaces and you want to make YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and everybody else's personal website a safe space.
[57:32.000 --> 57:39.000]  And you don't want to see our colloidal silver and body armor ads advertised on Google.
[57:39.000 --> 57:51.000]  So you go complain and then, oh, look, we're banned there. You have such power, big bullying groups who are nothing but astroturf that the globalists have made the politically protected groups.
[57:51.000 --> 58:00.000]  But just like what we've seen happen with dig years ago and, you know, my space as they begin to censor these things, they make everyone exodus off.
[58:00.000 --> 58:10.000]  And there's an exodus out of MSM, an exodus right out of Facebook and Twitter. And I'm already found another great advertising platform that doesn't even work with these groups.
[58:10.000 --> 58:22.000]  It'll probably be even more successful. So God certainly blessing us to thank you all for your prayers. But I mean, you talk about a bunch of basically spoiled brats who run around screaming racism all day.
[58:22.000 --> 58:31.000]  And when I go to these events to cover them, they're like 90% white screaming, you're an effing white male shut up.
[58:31.000 --> 58:40.000]  So I'm not trying to blame white people. It's just the fact that stereotypical social justice warrior is a disenfranchised, criminally inclined white person.
[59:02.000 --> 59:03.000]  Available.
[59:03.000 --> 59:14.000]  Vitamin, mineral, fusion, drink mix at m4warslife.com is loaded with a full month supply of essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[59:14.000 --> 59:27.000]  In the history of m4wars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like survival shield x2, super male vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[59:27.000 --> 59:34.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products and this part is most important.
[59:34.000 --> 59:40.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[59:40.000 --> 59:46.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure and rest secured. You're finding the tip of the spear in the info war.
[59:46.000 --> 59:51.000]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[59:51.000 --> 59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:56.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  You better turn me loose. You better set me free.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  A little bit better than it used to be because I'm alive.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  Live wire.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  Sounds like I'm proud to be cool, doesn't it?
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Or that I can shoot bullseye at 500 yards?
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  Alright, I'm gonna stop it right there.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  I just love all the blessings you can give to my God. You gotta have some self confidence in this world.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  But you can't be a confident person that looks down on people that don't have skills you have because if you start doing that, you become nothing but a predator.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  So there's massive censorship that a lot of folks are involved in right now.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  And Pooty Pie, Paul Watson did a report on this guy. I know he's been huge forever, but since he tried to censor him and took a bunch of sponsors away, he's gotten even bigger.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  My older daughter comes home from school and says, can we please watch Pooty Pie? You're on some of his new videos. Oh my gosh, Daddy, you're so famous.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  Oh my gosh, Daddy, you're on Pooty Pie. You're on Pooty Pie. He's so handsome.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Pooty Pie. In between Paul Watson. I love Paul Watson.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  I mean, I'm telling you folks, Paul Watson is becoming as popular as Pooty Pie, but he's doing serious political analysis, not, you know, the 10 best cat videos.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  This is so exciting, folks, because real satisfaction is knowing, even if they take me out or something, we have found all these superstars of liberty like Paul Watson and others.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Let's go back to the piece.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Yeah, unanimous support of Pooty Pie. Even Casey Neistat, a huge liberal YouTuber, is being vocal in his support of Pooty Pie.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  All of this, even though he just gave support to Sargon of f**k at this.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  It's scary because these people have huge influence on kids and it seems that YouTube itself has turned right.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Yeah, YouTube has really turned right because Casey...
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  I will be voting for Hillary Clinton.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  Neistat is really right-wing. Sargon of f**k had a self-proclaimed liberal is really right-wing.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Pooty Pie, a guy from the most left-wing country on the planet, is really right-wing.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  This isn't about right-wing. It's about anyone daring to express a thought crime or make a joke that triggers your insatiable desire to ban all the things.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  See Kyle. See Kyle. See Kyle.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Here's fake news website Buzzfeed, how YouTube serves as the content engine of the Internet's dark side.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Oh, and who do we have here? Oh, it's my name, Sargon of f**k at. Then in the very next sentence, conspiratorial white identity neo-nazis.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  Morally and ethically shouldn't YouTube be asking itself the same hard questions as Facebook and Twitter about the role it plays in a representative democracy?
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Yeah. Morally and ethically shouldn't Buzzfeed be asking itself, why Buzzfeed is cancer?
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  What's next? Have you got a secret dossier about how me and Sargon hired huckers to piss on a bed?
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  It never ceases to amaze me. How incredibly stupid you regressive twats are.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  You pick to fight with a guy who has 53 million subscribers, a guy who can rely on the support of other top YouTubers who have a combined total of hundreds of millions of subscribers.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  And look at what happened. He just redpilled millions of young people about how your institution is in complete meltdown.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  How trust in media is cratering. How your ad revenue is dropping off a cliff.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  When are you going to realize you've lost your ability to control public opinion?
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  When are you going to realize that everyone thinks you're an absolute joke?
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  When are you going to realize that you don't have the moral high ground?
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Almost everybody hates you because you're making everything joyless and terrible.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  You've declared war on fun.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  The star of the much loved 90s British comedy show Absolutely Fabulous says they can't even resurrect it because too many people would be offended.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Most of the movies that have Oscars be stilled upon.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  It's important upon infowars.com. I'm tweeting it out at Real Alex Jones. By the way, PewDiePie has 15 billion views in six years.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  No wonder they want to shut him down. They're a bunch of jealous nobody.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Oh, I'm sorry BuzzFeed didn't get into the last press conference because you're fake news that made up PP Gay.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  And nobody reads you but your own little foppish followers and other control freaks.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  You're a bunch of anti-liberal scum.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  It's Ashley Beckford here for infowars.com.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  The National Council of La Raza, an organization that promotes the reconquista of the southern United States,
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  called President Trump's executive order a quote declaration of war on the Hispanic community equivalent to the slave trade.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  This organization, meaning the race, La Raza, is promoting Make America Mexico Again.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  The president of the National Council of La Raza claimed the president's plan to build a wall on the southern border
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  and deport violent illegal immigrants will quote tarnish our nation's character.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  The bottom line is this, President Trump's decision to build a wall on the southern border does not violate human rights.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  President Trump is protecting our borders from radical extremists and criminal thugs.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  Stay tuned at infowars.com for more immigration news.

[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  We are now into hour number two.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Millie Weaver.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  One of our reporters is here in studio with us.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  You're a radio listener.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  You can always watch it at infowars.com, or watch our show, the free feeds, or they're archived every day for PrisonPlanet.TV members,
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  and then the large excerpts from posts on YouTube, Facebook, and other third-party platforms.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  But more and more, we're having to focus on our own platforms because of the massive censorship that is now being executed against us.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  If you just tuned in, Hootie Pie, who has been big for six years, has right at 15 billion views on YouTube according to his About page.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  That's from YouTube.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  And this was a few days ago, but joined in 2010, six and a half years ago, and there he is almost at 15 billion views,
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  not to mention all the derivative channels that are out there.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  It's much higher than that.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  So when YouTube told me two years ago, their vice president said,
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  listen, you have five billion views, not just your channels that have a couple billion views,
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  but you have five billion views.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  You've never monetized this.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  You can monetize everybody's channels and bring in a lot of money to fund yourself.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  But I didn't want to have everybody's channels get shut down with copyright claims.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  So I said, no, let's just monetize the 18 channels we have.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  And so it brings in a fraction of what it would.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  But people like Pootie Pie, you know, he brings in years ago, more than $10 million a year.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  Well, they've taken his sponsors away and YouTube has said,
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  if you make any more Hitler jokes, you're going to be banned.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  Now, putting this in context, this guy has more viewers than Fox News, tens of millions every day.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  The absolute key demographic of young people ages 10 to about 20.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  He's got the demographic you want for branding for the rest of somebody's life.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  I mean, the guy has more viewers in a couple of days than the Super Bowl.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  But then why is the Super Bowl God?
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Because it's the old system.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  And granted, it's got 80 million viewers.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  It's bad.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  But how do we have 80 million viewers some weeks?
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  And we're just nobody.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  We're just, you know, we're fake news.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  Who cares?
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  Again, the only thing we haven't figured out to do in the new media that's bigger than the old media is
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  monetize it to fully displace the globalist press.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  And they know that.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  So there's a perfect storm of wanting to kick us off the Internet, kick us off terrestrial radio,
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  to kick us off XM when Goldman Sachs came in and kind of kick Claire Channel out.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  I'm not in business with Claire Channel.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  They had some nice VPs there that I talked to that put us on XM a few years ago, eight years ago,
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  and it was very successful.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  But just giving people some background here of why I'm talking about this.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  This isn't just about info wars or some guy on YouTube that has, you know, 14 billion plus views,
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  almost 15 billion on one channel.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  It's about the fact that he did a Charlie Chaplin skit.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  They got his anti Nazi, by the way.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  And they've taken all this, all the sponsors.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  Yeah.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  And he was making fun of the Nazis.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  So it's like you can't even make fun of the Nazis because then they're going to point the finger at you anyway
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  for saying something slightly anti-Semitic.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  But any other mainstream channel can do whatever they want.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  If you show leaked WikiLeaks combat video, ABC News can have their own YouTube and show it.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  They don't get a strike we do.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  So what I'm saying is even though we're bigger than the dinosaur media and drudges and PewDiePie and everybody,
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  there's hundreds of prominent people that have more views than mainstream media individually.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  This is how they're shutting us down is selectively enforcing made up rules.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Exactly.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  That's exactly what's happening.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  And I've even experienced it myself on my YouTube channel, the Millennial Millie channel.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Everything you do political is, tell folks about it.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Yeah.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Well, you know, I posted a video about how info wars is under attack and how, you know,
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  we had our advertisement last week and, you know, how that was a big deal.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  And all the video was just me saying this and saying how we're under attack.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  And next thing you know, I look on there and YouTube demonetized the video.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  Now, a separate thing from the monetization aspect, you know, you're not making money once they demonetized.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  But the main thing is, is that their algorithms actually promote the videos that are monetized.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  So what it actually does is it, it's a way of stifling your video because it's not a priority.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  They want to put priority on those.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  YouTube last week allowed to family audiences a video of gay men defecating on each other and urinating on each other.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  But because they're gay, it's okay.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Yes.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  That's exactly.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  But, but, but if, if we say a cuss word, they will ban our video and kick us off.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  Or if you go out to a public event, you go out to interviews in a public event this weekend, people will come over and say, delete your video.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  And then somebody, we have the YouTube emails here.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  Yes.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  Those and investigates us.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  And they almost took our channel down, our video down because it'll give you a strike.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  But they said, no, actually you weren't showing personal or secret data.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  No.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  You should have privacy when you're at a public event in a woman's face, three women around Millie Bullinger.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  So I want to get to this because when you show document cam shots for TV viewers, so people can actually see the letter.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  But this is what we deal with where we can't go to public rallies where they yell, scream and cuss at us.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  We bleep it out on YouTube.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  We simply show them physically threatening a woman.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And then we're the bad people.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  See, because they're God.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  And this is why they've been set up as the political movement to take over because they have no morals.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  I don't mean morals and what they do sexually.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  I mean, they have no sense of justice.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  Go ahead.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  I'm ranting.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  That's exactly it.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  You know, I'm out at this event.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  I'm covering the news.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  I'm just reporting.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  I'm going up.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  I'm conducting interviews with a microphone.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  And, you know, everybody saw that I was clearly conducting interviews and the people actually came up and willfully participated in the interview.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  And it was only later that these three huge butch lesbians came up to me and started threatening me.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  And I'm a pretty reasonable person.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  If you want to come up and just be like, hey, you know, could you just not use that little snippet of me in the interview?
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  It's going to conflict with work.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  By the way, you were out there.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  I would definitely agree and say, you know what?
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  It wasn't even that great of an interview.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  By the way, you were out there by yourself because the cameraman was doing stuff in the car at that point.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  Because I was in the car.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  They waited until the one man that was with you left.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Then they came over.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  Plus, people run over and scream the whole time.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  Don't talk to her.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  She's with Info Wars.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  And even when someone wants to talk to you, people come over and try to stop them.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  So it's this again.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  It's a cult in my view.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  It is.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  That's exactly what it is.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  And they're just big bullies.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  And you can see right here in the video footage, they're bullying me here.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  They're threatening me that if I don't delete the footage in my camera, that they are posturing at me like they're going to stop me.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  They're going to, you know, beat me up.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  The girl even smacked my camera in this.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  You know, I mean, they were getting pretty aggressive.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  And some of these, not this one, but these other girls here, they were like six feet tall.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  They were huge.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  So at the same point, it's like, okay, you're going to bully me.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  You're a small woman.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  How tall are you?
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  I'm probably about 5'5".
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  You know, I'm small compared to these women.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Well, if you Google, anybody can search into this, lesbians have the highest level of family violence of any group.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  I'm not against lesbians.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  My whole thing is I've seen the stereotype in Austin to be the real deal where, I mean, it's like, you know, cigarettes wrapped up, you know, on the shoulder like James Dean.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  I'm in your face.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  There it is.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  This is what domestic violence is like when you're LGBT.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  And then it just goes through the whole thing.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  I mean, it's just, it's just, I don't get how the archetype of being inclusive of the press, inclusive to a woman, women are being beaten up all over the country when they go to Trump events or Milo events.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  And these people are proud of it.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  I don't understand.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  And then we're the bad people.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  And the craziest part to me is, okay, they were mad because they said I violated their safe space, which nobody knows the rules to violating their safe space.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  So it's just, it's.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  They just arbitrarily make them up.
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  The safe space is in front of the Capitol at a rally at night.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  Exactly.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  I guess so.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  But anyway, you know, public places, they own them.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  Yeah.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  That's what they think.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  And so they come out to a rally to get attention on the news.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  The news shows up.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  And because it's info wars, because we're say a thousand times bigger than a local TV station, let's say 2000 times bigger.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  Let's, let's not underestimate me three times thousand because we're so huge and so real.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  We're not human.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  We don't have any rights.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  Yeah.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  That's it.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  And you know, the craziest part is, is some of these were transgender people.
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  I'm taking from most likely taking hormones, steroids, whatever else testosterone.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  And, you know, between men and women, there's a, there's like a rule almost like an unspoken rule that our culture has that men don't attack women.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  Men don't hit women.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  And your women aren't supposed to hit.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  A bunch of men are about to come kill you.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  Yeah.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  And so what it was was, okay, they're coming up to me almost like looking somewhat very masculine.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  Almost like men probably taking these hormones, but in their mind, that's part of the culture.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  We don't know we're speculating.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  They look, look, they're very, very aggressive.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  Absolutely.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  I'm going to skip this breaks.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  We have more time.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  It's like a 12 minute report.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  And now again, we can't even use the name of what was in the news was in the paper.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  We can't use the official name because then we'll be censored on YouTube for using a word.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  They say we can't use, which was expropriated, which was appropriated.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  The word queer just means stranger, unusual.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  Then it was used as an insult or a pejorative.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  And so now these groups, which is fine, have taken the term on as a thing of pride.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  But what they're saying is in literature, art and culture, only they can use it.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  Well, now they took the word gay though, which just means a happy day or a gay lad or a gay puppy or whatever.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  It was a gay day.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  So again, more and more words are appropriate.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  And we now see the game.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  We first give them the first words they want.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  They're just using these people.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  This is the globalist admittedly wanting to come in and in the language in debate,
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  ban whiteboards because somebody might write something on them that hurt somebody's feelings.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  Truly ban everything.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  That's truly it.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  And you know, as far as these emails that I got from YouTube saying that I needed to basically remove this content or blur these people out.
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  Well, the people I'm assuming it was the people that came up and bullied me because they were the ones who were so adamant against this video.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  They were probably the ones who made the complaint and they said that I use their personal information,
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  which is not true because that would be like your social security number, your phone number, your address.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  They made a false complaint.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  We've had these fake reports.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  In fact, this weekend I almost called you to come on Sunday.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  I said, I'll let her have some time.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  But I was going to call you guys and say, watch, someone's going to put a report in.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  Because I know this is what happens.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  Let's go over more of these letters for folks because this is happening.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  Again, this is for you going to a public rally showing them acting aggressively.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  Mainly, I would say, abusively in my opinion.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  But again, we have to be penalized.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  Let's go over this letter.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  Go ahead and read it.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  Yeah, they want to censor us.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  You know, and if we don't fight back, if we don't say, hey, this is enough, then they're going to win.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  This is what, you know, basically they started out saying that this is to notify you that we've received a privacy complaint from an individual regarding your content.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  And this is where they basically just tried to say that I was, you know, using somebody's public private information.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  And then I disputed it because if we don't dispute this stuff, then we lose and they silence us.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  Yeah, they take your channel down.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  Exactly. This is part of what I said.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  They also froze the comments on the video.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  I said, I've reviewed the alleged privacy complaint.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  This is a false complaint.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  All people shown spoke into my handheld microphone with foreign knowledge that I was conducting interviews.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  No private information of anyone is ever displayed anywhere within the video.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  Everything shown in this video is from the public and what people willfully displayed in the public at a public event.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  Absolutely. No perception of privacy, especially in a rally.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  A rally is the one absolute place of no privacy.
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  Yes, and I just went on to say that everything shown in this video falls under public domain and fair use and is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and the Fair Use Doctrine.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  And then, lo and behold, YouTube comes back to me later and says, oh, okay, we reviewed the complaint and basically it doesn't violate any rules and, you know, they're not going to...
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  Now, again, a lot of viewers are asking, why are we obsessing over one video and what happened?
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Because it's a microcosm of a guy that has 14.7 billion views, almost 15 billion views.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  The biggest thing in the world, okay?
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  I mean, let's just say it.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  Pooty Pie is the biggest thing on TV, Internet world, period, like Drudge is the biggest thing when it comes to news, okay?
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  Here we are, right below that tier, but hardcore info, reaching the politicos, the military, world leaders.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  I mean, InfoWars is talking to kids.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  Kids are great to talk to, but I'm very proud of the fact that we have a very high-brow audience, okay, when it comes to, you know, the intelligentsia.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  People like General Flynn and many, many others that are in the White House right now.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  But you look at this, again, this is them taking something totally wholesome, totally good that we did,
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  bleeping out the cussing, all of it, and then it's our fault when clearly they're the ones misbehaving.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  By any yardstick, this is a false claim, a false report, and is outrageous as an attack on the First Amendment,
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  just like I saw people getting beat up all over D.C. with their families trying to get into the inauguration.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  The news that announced that I was arrested for fighting, none of it was even true.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  The police were protecting me, just like Cleveland.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  So they said the same thing in Cleveland. I was arrested.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  They, they sit there with fake news all day saying we're the fake news and saying Donald Trump's a liar.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  He didn't bring in jobs back when every number shows. No president's ever done it this quick.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  Took Reagan four years to get it going like this.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  Trump's done it in 45 days. It's insane.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  But again, it's a total inversion of reality.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  So if they can shut down, you know, other top YouTubers and us, they can shut anybody down.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  And this is happening right now and people need to understand that they can't just take this information for granted.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  They need to understand that we're in very, very dark times because yes, we're winning politically,
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  but that's why big corporations and governments want to shut us down and shut you down because we are winning.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  Folks, we're that close. It's why they're out bullying the town halls and the city councils and the state houses.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  It's why they're death-threading everybody. It's why they're calling for President Trump's death because he's a nationalist, populist,
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  champion of incredible courage, taking action and defeating the enemy like nothing I've ever seen.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  They call that bootlicking. That's called reality.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  Okay? If Trump was going sideways, I'd be all over him like King Kong.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  Okay? It's just not true.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  The attacks on him are misrepresentations. They censor him.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  He says, fake news is the enemy of the American people.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  They go, oh, he says, old media is the enemy. He wants to shut down the media. Never said any of that.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  They lie. They're the ones calling for us to be shut down.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  Obama signed the bill to start shutting down the alternative media.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  We are the media. We're winning audience. Know that.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  Support our local MNFM affiliates because that may be the only place we're on soon the way this is going.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  Exactly.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  I mean, I've been kicked off XM despite the fact it was huge revenue.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  Clear Channel was making a lot of money selling ads on my show.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  We were one of the most popular shows on XM, a political talk.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  They wanted to give me my own channel.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  And then the foreign investors came in and said, you take him off.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Then the same foreign multinational groups came in and bought me off the local station I was on.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  They said, we'll give you $100,000 a quarter to take him off and put these sponsors in.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  And they said, no, they said $200,000, $300,000.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  I mean, until they just said, OK, I mean, that's what goes on folks to shut us up.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  Why is it?
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  Because if we ever catch fire, which is starting to happen, you think we're big now?
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  We really catch fire. It's over for them.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  Yep.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  Millie, I'm ranting. Sorry.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  That's exactly it. And if you're somebody on YouTube that wants to just put out a bunch of mindless entertainment,
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  that's just, you know, nothing interesting.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  There's no political...
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  But they're even shutting that down now because they don't...
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  Yeah.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  They can't compete with even Blither.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  Yeah.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  And Blither is better than them trying to hurt families and globalism and tell us GMOs are good.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  So the fact is they don't want anybody that's got an audience, but them.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  Exactly, because they want it controlled.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  They want it in their spectrum where they can do their programming.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  It's just like, you know, what Mika Zabrinsky said the other day on air,
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  we're the ones that control the programming.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  We're the ones that control what they think.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  That shows our arrogance.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  I mean, it's exactly what they think.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  They're so arrogant.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  That's behind closed doors.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  They say that now.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  They're externalizing the method.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  This is a 12-minute video.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  Let's just play a few minutes from the first to get a flavor and then fast forward to the bullying at the end.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  And again, give folks the name of the video.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  The name of the video is Ultimate Cringe.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  I think it was Queer Dance Freakout at the Governor's Mansion.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  There it is.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  LGBTQ Dance Freakout Protest, Ultimate Cringe video.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Yeah, we didn't use the name they gave at Queer.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  Yes.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  They'll probably talk about it here.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  That's their event.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  We can't even say the name they said.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  That word's theirs, nobody else's.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  This is an attack on language, just like 1984.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  And they're using our own liberal sensibilities to get us to give up our speech
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  because they know Americans are very tolerant and very liberal.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  I'm very liberal in my life about don't hurt somebody.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  Don't hurt yourself.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  Yes.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  Do whatever you want.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Everybody knows that.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  People know that about Trump.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  That's why they misrepresent it.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  Let's go to the report.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  Let me get this straight.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  You want conservatives to be tolerant of you and let you guys use any bathroom you choose,
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  but you're going to be intolerant towards me just because I have an infowars microphone.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  So I've watched infowars before.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  You call people like me, cucks, lip darts, betas, and crying PC.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  You know, we're trying to show our speech now, we do.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  When they go asking, why fail?
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Who said about you?
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  See, he doesn't even get it.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  Milly, we were reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  We're here in Austin, Texas, outside of the governor's mansion where there's a
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  dance off festival being held while the image of this festival showed a picture of Donald
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  Trump having his brains blown out by a rainbow that was coming out of a vagina with wings.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  So you can see that there's a lot of anti-Donald Trump sentiment here.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  It's also important to note that the governor of Texas is handicapped and does use a wheelchair.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  And they had kids there, they had naked women running around, they had people, you know,
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  just engaging in discussing behavior.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  It's the fault of society.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  No one's ever said no to these people.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  So let's go ahead and talk to them and see how they feel about Donald Trump.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  But the main thing here is, are they going to be tolerant towards me because I'm an
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  infowars supporter while they're trying to say that conservatives need to be tolerant of them.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  They're practically feminine too, they don't like that.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  What were you saying about infowars?
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  I just said that's infowars.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  That's a pretty nice person.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  I remember that.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  The dance party.
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  Let me get this straight.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  You want conservatives to be tolerant of you and let you guys use any bathroom you choose,
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  but you're going to be intolerant towards me.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  Most of you have been from very oppressive families.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  You told them sex was bad and stuff, now they go the other extreme.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  People like me, cucks, lipdards, betas, and cryingy PCY baby, cryingy babies.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  So f**k you.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Just because, excuse me sir, we're not saying that directed towards homosexuals in any way.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  What's happening over here?
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  Well, we're just trying to talk to people.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  What brings you out here today?
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  Well, who are you?
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  And again, people ask why we leave the boring ones here because we're not editing.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  We're infowars.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  We cut out the desk faces.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  We're showing you what happened.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  We would be considered anti-establishment.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  There was one guy that's kind of funny and he's like, you know, he starts proposing to you.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  Yeah, this lady here, she was like trying to basically tell me I needed to disclose who I was to her.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  You've got a flag on the microphone.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Yeah, I guess not.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  Perspective.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  We don't lobby.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  We just report the news.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  We're libertarians, man.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  We're here to help.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  People should be able to use whatever bathroom they want.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Bathrooms.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  Bathrooms.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  Let's just have some bathrooms.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  Can people buy their pronouns?
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  No, I don't.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  But I think it's a very courteous and kind thing to do.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  My pronoun is they.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  They?
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Yeah, that's her.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  They's pronoun.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  I mean, look, this looks like a total cult.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  I have a hard time with the pronoun thing because it wants you to speak grammatically.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  This is in public schools and colleges everywhere.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  You have the GZ, all this, you know, Star Trek Cook, Blonnie.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  Excuse me.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  They can never talk.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  Never have points.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  Don't you guys want tolerance?
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  I'm tolerant.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  Yeah.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  So she's just cursing me out and then I'm like, are you tolerant?
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  She's like, I'm tolerant.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  Yes.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  Tolerance.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  Tolerance.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  Tolerance.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  Tolerance.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  In the words.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  In the words.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  In the words.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  In the words.
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  In the words.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  And the other people try to talk to you and later they won't let you talk to them.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  Alex Jones, he's the drug test because I have, I have energy.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  I think that most of the people there would not have passed the drug test.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  But she's saying give Alex Jones a drug test.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  I mean, what does that even mean?
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  Like I'm not going running around in circles with a bunch of naked people and, you know, kids.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  Yeah.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  I mean, you know, right by the Capitol in the governor's mansion in the middle of the street.
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  Like running around naked.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  Like they're all insane.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  And then we're just sitting here trying to cover it and they're mad at us and we need to be drug tested.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  We need to be drug tested.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  See the power of the state needs to come in and get us.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  We're going to come back and show the bullying and the Dr. Corsies that brain is the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  According to a Canadian study, a DNA test showed only half of Subway's oven roasted patty is made with real chicken.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  Subway was among five fast food restaurants whose chicken the Canadian Broadcast Corporation had tested.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  The Subway sandwich chain has refuted the results of the DNA test in a release statement.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  In case you're wondering what the heck was in the rest of those patties and chicken strips, it's soy.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  Multiple studies have shown eating soy products can cause males to develop gynecomastia.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  That's right guys, male breasts and summers coming.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  Fight the information war and buy super male vitality at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:23.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  The general public doesn't.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then foldwarstore.com.
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  At the start of the next hour, we've got a very important investigative report by Rob Jacobson and Darren McBreen dealing with the plan.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  It was laid out in a book published just a month ago by Chelsea Clinton that's gotten no attention,
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  calling for global government through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with her at the head of it.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  Now, that all got dropped because, or at least got postponed over the time being,
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  because by the grace of God, obviously, Hillary Clinton did not get in, but that's how big the stakes were.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  So a special report, then Gerald Salente at about 15 after joint just the trends forecaster for the Balanced The Hour,
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  and then Josh Owen is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  Yeah, Owen Shroyer. I always cross Josh Owen and Owen Shroyer together.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  I had a teleprompter free of our great Cameron editors, Josh Owen with Owen Shroyer.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  Owen Shroyer, our social justice warrior slayer.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour of the Blitzkrieg of the news and information.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  We've got a Dr. Jerome Corsi here in just a few minutes,
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  but I wanted to finish up with our own Millie Weaver, or Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Millie Weaver said that those names aren't that close.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  With this weekend, what day was this by the capital, Friday?
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  I think it was Thursday.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  Okay, so you have the LGBTQ, but now it's 50 designations according to Facebook, folks out there,
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  and whether they're trainees or women, men, whatever, I don't hate any of them.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  There's this presumption that we're all out to get you and you're movie stars and we're bad people,
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  and you should be able to train our kids at age five to do whatever you want.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  And so Millie's talking about this video.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  They tried to get taken down off YouTube saying that we were in a private event showing private information,
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  and YouTube rightly said, no, this is a false claim.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  The reason I'm covering it is it's happening everywhere now,
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  and a lot of times they're actually honoring these things and taking channels down
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  and taking the sponsorship of one channel that has 14, almost 15 billion views
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  that we talked about earlier, PewDiePie.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  So they want to shut down not just InfoWars, not just Drudge,
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  not just Breitbart who they're taking the sponsors away from and banning them off AdRole
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  and all the rest of the same stuff's happening.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  And then kicking our apps, Breitbart's apps off of iTunes.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  This is outrageous interference.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  Serious racketeering in my view, and I've talked to lawyers,
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  and they think that's the case.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  But now they're trying to get rid of channels that are just entertainment
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  because they're so big and it makes the corporations look bad and makes them jealous
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  that PewDiePie has billions of viewers a year, way bigger than CNN,
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  even bigger than Fox News, and he's incredibly popular with teenagers.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  So Millie's really popular with teenagers.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Paul Watson is the second biggest thing on YouTube,
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  bigger than Milo, bigger than Gavin McGinnis, who are all great guys.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  It's not about who's the biggest.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  But our own Paul Watson has over 10 million views conservatively a week
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  just on YouTube and Facebook.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  His tweets get more impressions than the BBC combined.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  That's been the news.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  Hundreds of millions of impressions every week.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  Hundreds of millions of people read it.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  Folks, what I'm telling you is that's why they're all panicking,
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  is because Trump understands this is happening and is riding in on this wave.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  How come they stand against this?
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  We're going to play this clip of the bullying, but go over some final points, Millie.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  Well, just a final point on that is what Paul Watson was talking about
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  with conservatism being the new counterculture of the new punk rock.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  We do have a lot of young people wanting to tune into our channels,
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  wanting to see what we have to say, and they're becoming very interested
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  and it's diverting away from the mainstream media television programming.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  And that's the problem.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  They want to control the minds of the youth,
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  and they don't like the fact that we're influencing them.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  And look, while we're talking about being inclusive here in liberal Austin,
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  I've had in the last week, this always happens with McAdoo,
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  but I've had two guys and one lady come over and say,
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  I have a crush on Millie Weaver, more of her on the show.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  So the point is, we're just dominating and we're not here bragging how big we are.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  It's that fake stream media, old dinosaur media is already imploding
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  and they don't know what to do.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  And so that's why they're trying to shut us down.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  We're going to go to Dr. Corsi here in about two minutes, but here it is.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  They wanted this at a public event taken down.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  They were saying, telling her to erase footage she had of an interview
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  they consented to in front of the Capitol at a rally with the media in attendance.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  No perception of privacy.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  You gave the interview, then they tried to take down or someone claiming they were them,
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  take down our YouTube channel because of it.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  Again, this is the mindset.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  They're bullying and threatening a woman,
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  but it's okay because they're LGBTQ, barbecue, whatever it is. Here it is.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  What's your number one cause that you're fighting for?
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  I mean, you can't prioritize people's lives, you know?
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  It's an intersectional thing.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  So, I mean, gay rights, trans rights, rights of all marginalized people,
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  especially people of color, like you can't rape them.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  I don't know what the f*** is going on, honestly.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  I don't understand where we are.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  I don't know how we got to here.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  We just need to dance.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  I swear that is, like, this relationship.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  Alicia talked to you.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Yeah.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  Where are you being filmed?
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  I thought I was dressed as a woman.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  I'm a Natalie's woman, buddy, and here it is.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Yeah, what YouTube channel, though?
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Why are you guys, like, coming up to me like that?
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  Because you want to know, because Washington was my partner for a sec.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  You filmed my partner.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  Why are you being so crazy and weird?
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  You guys are being crazy.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  We're asking because you filmed about my partner,
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  and that's their now personal image.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  So, you have to delete that.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  They don't want that on there anymore.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  Okay.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  Can you, I'd like to see that.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  Sure, I'll delete it.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  Okay, so let's watch you do it right now.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  We don't watch you do it right now.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  Okay.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Yeah, let's watch it.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  It's my image.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  Oh, don't get that f***ing image.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  All right, sure.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  This is newsgabber.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  I'm wearing my rainbow snatch disguise right now.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  Everything was going great.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  I was interviewing these SJWs.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  I was trying my best to, you know,
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  to blend in and mesh with their, you know,
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  their programming and whatnot,
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  their political correctness as rainbow snatch.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  And as I'm going along,
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  I interviewed these transgender lesbian types
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  and they ended up, you know,
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  asking me some questions after the interview
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  and it was pretty, it was really a boring interview.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  Nothing really exciting happening in this interview.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  I'm a specific transgender.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  And then afterwards they're like,
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  oh, where's Diego?
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  What are the exact quotes?
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  I said on YouTube.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  You know, look me up on YouTube.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  Well, what it was was they were completely like surrounding me
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  and hitting me, hitting the camera into my face,
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  posturing that they were going to, you know,
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  beat me up.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  Don't share it.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  But they didn't realize that I got them coming up
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  and threatening me.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  All of them have their own safe spaces
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  with different rules.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  Finally, closing comments.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  I'm going to go to Dr. Corsi.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  I appreciate you having the courage to do that.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  But we've got to send out some more crew with you.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  As soon as your camera guy went to the car
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  to get some more, you know, batteries,
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  that's when they just send it on you.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  Yes, that's exactly it.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  And, you know, you don't know
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  when these people are going to get triggered.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  They're so volatile.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  I really do think that there's a mental illness
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  somewhat plays a role in why somebody would come up
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  and threaten me like this
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  and try to bully me into, you know,
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  turning my footage off or deleting footage.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  And the bottom line is, I did turn off my camera.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  More than mental illness.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  More than mental illness.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  And of course, that's your opinion, my opinion.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  We can all have a pain.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  It's a sense of entitlement.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  That's what it is.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  It's a raging entitlement and arrogance.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  That's exactly what it is.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  And they felt like they said,
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  I violated their safe space
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  and that they had a right for me to delete their footage
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  because I violated their safe space,
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  which I don't even know how I did that
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  or how I could have done that as rainbow snatch.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  All right.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  What do you got coming up next?
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  I know you're working on a lot of stuff.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  We got full coverage tonight,
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  seven o'clock an hour before Trump.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  Then we'll have the live event where he speaks to Congress
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  and his biggest speech yet in his own words.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  And then after that, we're going to have live coverage
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  afterwards tonight, seven o'clock central.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  It kicks off.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  There'll be free feeds.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  And then fullwords.com forward slash show.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  What else is coming up?
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Well, we're just excited to see
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  Donald Trump's press conference.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  You know, that's going to be coming out tonight.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  And we got some really cool bullet points,
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  which Trump's going to be talking on.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  He's going to be talking on jobs, education.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  He's going to be talking about some issues
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  and how he's going to help improve some of the inner cities.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  All right.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  Great job, Millie.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  But again, we have to illustrate,
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  they wanted this taken down,
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  tried to have it taken down for our free speech
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  when they're the ones hitting or slapping
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  or threatening her.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  Dr. Jerome Corsi doesn't need any introduction.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  He's on Twitter at twitter.com forward slash Jerome underscore Corsi.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  We got Gerald Salente coming up the next hour.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  Dr. Corsi will be with us till five after.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  He has got some major breaking news.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  He received his PhD from Harvard University in political science in 72.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  He's currently senior staff writer now here at info wars.com
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  for our Washington bureau,
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  which he's setting up and developing and getting going.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  Of course, he's written three New York times.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  Number one best sellers formally headed up a lot of operations
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  there at the great world net daily.com.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  And again, he's got major breaking news.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  Part two, the story is up on info wars.com right now.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  Dealing with what really happened with Obamacare
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  and where Obama looted the money.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  Exclusive Obama illegally robbed Fannie Mae Freddie to fund Obamacare.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Now that's yesterday's article, the new article.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  We're going to tell you about here in a moment.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  It's up on info wars.com.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  Dr. Corsi is going to join us to break that down.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  So, so, so fellas sent on the first article and now part two.
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  I mean, you're linked to court cases.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  You're linked to the public record.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  No one else has reported this.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  I guess one of your White House tipsters told you, hey,
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  you might want to look at this.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  Simply amazing.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  But the information did come from inside some of the top consultants
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  in Washington said, we've got to look at this.
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  And what the story is, is that Fannie and Freddie
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  were the two mortgage giants.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  These are the two federal mortgage giants.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  We're suffering losses in 2008, 2009.
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  Although I'm not even sure now the losses were there.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  I think that might be a cover story too.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  At any rate, the federal government put through the Treasury
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  $187 billion in notes into Fannie and Freddie.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  There's investors, there's private investors in Fannie and Freddie.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  What we found out was that when Congress would not allow
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  taxpayer money to go into paying the insurance subsidies in Obamacare,
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  the Obama administration just put these two mortgage giants
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  into a conservatorship and stole the money.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  The investors didn't get a penny.
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  All the dividends, all the earnings,
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  all the profits went into the Treasury.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  And the Treasury used the money to pay for Obamacare subsidies.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  Now, you're an expert in banking and in fraud.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  You've been a consultant to the government, state department.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  You haven't reached more than a journalist.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  You're an expert on this area.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  How big is this?
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  How criminal is this?
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  How massive is this scandal?
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  Well, it's huge.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  I mean, this is $187 billion that was just stolen by the illegally taken.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  The administrative branch, the executive branch,
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  is not able to have taxing powers and it can't just reallocate money
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  that's supposed to go to private investors,
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  which is the nature of Fannie and Freddie,
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  steal that money from them, say,
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  you're not going to get paid anything.
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  You're rights as a shareholder, we're going to ignore.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  And that money then comes into Treasury and Treasury says,
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  well, Congress told us we can't use taxpayer money
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  to pay for the Obamacare subsidies.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  Obamacare is broke, so in order to keep it from going bankrupt,
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  we'll just steal this money.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  We'll just confiscate it from Fannie and Freddie
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  and put it into Obamacare.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  Now, that also weakens Fannie and Freddie
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  so that they're vulnerable, should there be another financial downturn,
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  because that money also should have gone to
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  propping up the reserves of the two mortgage giants.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  It's a huge theft and the victims in this
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  are the shareholders of Fannie and Freddie
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  and the mortgage holders who are depending upon
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  a strong Fannie and Freddie in the future
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  that the capital needed to underwrite the mortgages in this country.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  And the Obama administration simply did this surreptitiously.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  I mean, it's taken us two years to really figure out what happened.
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  And as we're now getting court cases proceeding,
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  that's what my second article is about.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  We're getting documents.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  They tried to keep almost 11,000 documents.
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  First it was 50,000 documents.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  Now they're down to 11,000 documents.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  So that's how this is coming out is via discovery
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  and you're linked to it all.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  What's crazy is when you said I had an exclusive a few days ago,
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  you told me about it.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  I went and searched in it and certainly there was nothing there.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  When I read your first article,
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  you were linked to federal lawsuits.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  You'd think MSM, even if they're anti-Trump,
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  would not want to rip off a taxpayer
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  and would want to expose $100 plus billion swindle
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  just to begin with, but they don't.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  They're so much worse than they even were five years ago.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  At least you still had people at CBS
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  who would expose Fast and Furious.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  Now it seems like they've culled everyone.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  They've run everybody off and had any basic decency.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  If Trump was doing something like this,
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  I'd expose it instantly.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  I cannot believe the criminal level
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  of the collusion that's going on.
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  The mainstream media is determined to run the story
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  that Obamacare is successful,
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  that people have gotten insurance that they need
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  that wouldn't otherwise be insured.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  Now what they aren't saying is that the exorbitant cost
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  on others getting insurance
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  back the need to steal money from Benny and Freddie,
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  these two mortgage giants,
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  in order to keep the insurance subsidies afloat.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  The truth is that Obamacare is already bankrupt.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  It has been bankrupt.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  And the truth is,
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  we know that they knew it was a giant looting operation
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  all along.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  It was never even meant to help people,
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  but to take over one seventh of the U.S. economy,
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  which they now admit it's wrecked.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  But that, like it was just a mistake,
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  no, from your own research and from my own research,
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  clearly, is it correct to say Dr. Corsi,
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  this was engineered as a screw job
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  in their own words to ruin healthcare
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  to then bring in single payer.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  They admit that.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  It was rigged to fail from the very beginning.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  Obamacare was created to fail.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  And the failsafe was going to be,
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  the federal government comes in
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  and takes over the entire healthcare industry.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  But the story here is that
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  to take over the healthcare industry,
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  they also took over the housing industry.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  They've also gone into Fannie and Freddie,
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  which is, are they basic?
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  And that's the key.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  They used laws they did in the 90s
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  to allow the bubble with the Clintons.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  Then they come in with the banking regulation,
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  housing reform laws, and Frank Dodd, as you know.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  Yes.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  Let's elaborate on that,
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  which shuts down the small banks, the small enders,
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  and only lets the mega banks engage in it.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  Again, further vertical integration.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  And it pushed every, all the mortgage market
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  into Fannie and Freddie.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  Which they've eluded criminally.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  This is incredible, including private investors.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  That's what's in the lawsuit, correct?
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  It's in the lawsuit.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  I mean, you've got private investors out there
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  who bought stock and are just being told,
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  we're told by the Obama administration,
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  you're not going to get anything in your stock,
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  because we confiscated it into the treasury.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  So this is like a bail-in.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  This is like Cyprus or Greece,
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  where they just grabbed 30% of your bank account,
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  but instead they just grabbed investors' systems
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  that the government manages,
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  showing us we don't want the government managing
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  private investments.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  And they lied.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  They were saying,
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  we have to put a conservatorship here
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  and take over the profits,
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  because Fannie and Freddie are failing.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  You know, the story here is that your articles
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  are so well documented.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  How in Hades did this never break?
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  And now it's been out for 24 hours,
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  and no one's even picking it up.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  This is sensational.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  I'm finding in the Twitter feed,
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  and look at my Twitter,
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  look at what's going on in InfoWars,
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  that now there are literally millions of people aware
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  that the Obama is-
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  I know we're reaching people,
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  and so it's a great story.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  What I'm saying is,
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  the silence from MSM is deafening.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  Well, they're going to ignore this,
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  because I mean,
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  the Obama administration
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  robbed the housing industry
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  to keep afloat of failing healthcare-
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  And by the way, that's not rhetoric.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  This is clear cut.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  But I mean, you're a fraud expert.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  You're a banking expert.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  Explain to people in layman's terms,
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  in 60 seconds what he did.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  Well, I mean, I was the one who caught HSBC
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  on their money laundering.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  It was $1.9 billion fine.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  It was my stories that broke that.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  And here I'm saying,
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  we've got a major scandal
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  that the Obama administration
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  has been risking putting the mortgage industry
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  at financial peril
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  in order to bail out
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  an already bankrupt Obamacare program.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  Which is criminal.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  You can't just take the investors' earnings away,
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  the dividends away,
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  and say,
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  well, Treasury's just going to confiscate them.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  That's what Obama said.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  And to the risk of the mortgage market,
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  I mean, Fannie and Freddie now
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  are the pillars upon which our mortgage market depends.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  And by taking out, you know,
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  over $200 billion in profits from Fannie and Freddie,
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  they've put Fannie and Freddie
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  in a much more risky financial position
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  than had that money gone,
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  the dividend payers.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  Sure, but the key here is,
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  I read the statutes you quote,
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  and plus I've studied the law,
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  because we all covered the housing crisis.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  I don't have degrees from Harvard like you,
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  but I mean, I can read the law and see what happened.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  This is clear-cut illegal.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  It was done clear-cut in secret,
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  just the so-called mandate in Obamacare
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  where Obama could kind of, you know,
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  manipulated how he wanted to.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  That still doesn't let him break the law.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  So what needs to happen?
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  What do listeners need to do now
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  to counter Obama and Gruber and everybody
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  that call us dumb idiots?
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  How do we become not dumb idiots
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  and make sure he gets brought to justice?
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  Trump is being really nice.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  He needs to get on the offensive against Hillary
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  with the Russian connections and the Chinese connections,
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  Congressman Kurt Weldon exposed last week
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  here with you that's admitted.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  We need to get on the offense
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  with this Obamacare thing.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  And listen, have sessions go after Obama.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  Obama has moved in
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  two miles from the White House in a bunker,
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  30,000 activists.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  Trump comes out and says he thinks Obama
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  is behind the unrest.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  Obama admits he's behind it.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  He's the quarterback for the coach that's toward Soros.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  So it's not like we're looking for trouble.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  These are seditious people.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  And I agree with Mike Savage.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  It's time to take the gloves off, man,
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  when foreign banks are trying to overthrow
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  the government and kill the president
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  and shut down the free press.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  It's time to go after them.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  Well, I agree.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  Congress specifically told Obama
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  he could not use tax money
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  in order to pay these Obamacare subsidies.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  They were, the Obama administration
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  had no way to pay them.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  So they start looking around.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  They figure we've got this pot of money
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  over in the mortgage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  And we can just go over and confiscate it.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  Legally, just take illegally,
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  no law, no authorization,
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  completely in violation of the Constitution,
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  which does not allow the executive branch
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  to begin to be its own taxing agent.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  And here Obama said,
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  we're just going to secretly take this money
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  under a ruse that Fannie and Freddie are.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  Sure, let me ask you this because as this comes out,
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  we know they're going to claim this.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  They're going to say,
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  well, this gave us the power to tax,
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  which you and I said years before it was law, it was.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  They said, oh, it's not a tax.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  Then they hire 18,000 IRS agents, all the rest of it.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  Then the Supreme Court says it's a tax.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  So under this, was this a new power of the executive?
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  So Obama's saying, hey, I can just grab private investments.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  I can grab hundreds of billions of people's money
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  that they've invested in the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac system
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  because I have this new power.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  So if that's the case, what else did he do
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  we haven't learned about?
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  Well, in fact, I'm going to tell you this story.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  It's just getting going.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  I mean, we're just beginning to get into it.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  It's very similar to what happened in the General Motors bankruptcy
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  when Obama came in and confiscated the money
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  of the subordinated debt holders who were first in line,
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  really should have been first in line
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  instead of taking the stock in which Obama did,
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  giving it to the labor union and told subordinated debt holders
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  who I know or my friends in Wall Street
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  that they dared complain about it.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  They would never work in that business again.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  And that's how the Obama administration's operated.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  Now we know they've confiscated, Obama confiscated
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  the dividend earnings of the private shareholders of Fannie and Freddie
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  and really diverted that money, confiscated it
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  without authorization of Congress, diverted it to pay for Obamacare
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  when Obamacare was going bankrupt on these insurance subsidies.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  Now, if that isn't entirely a set of criminal actions
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  that ultimately involves nightmare and the other heads of treasury
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  when this was going on between 2012 and 2016,
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  and it's still going on today, I mean.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  Well, Dr. Corsi, everybody's got to get your articles out there
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  It's just super important for everybody to get these out.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  We're going to have more reports from you in the next few days.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  I'm going to come back in just a moment.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  I want to ask you about the big speech tonight,
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  the fact that even Bloomberg admits it's small investors
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  that are actually making the market go up
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  while big investors try to implode it selfishly
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  just to kill our nationalist movement,
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  just like we see the EU doing with Brexit.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  It's so transparent.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  They've clearly miscalculated.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  The poll numbers show that.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  We're going to talk to you about that in just one moment
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  and then do one more segment with you
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  if you can, Dr. Jerome Corsi, of infowars
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  as our guest setting up our Washington bureau as we speak.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  But coming to Quentin Carter, who does security around here
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  but also works with some of the products
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  and proves up some of the self-defense items
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  that we carry in the store.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  Well, they came over and said to, hey,
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  Q brought this over.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  The new shirt came in.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  This is the proof.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  The shirts are coming in next week.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  They'll be shipped out to you.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  This is the new mega viral shirt.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  I can feel it. I know it.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  And it was Q's idea.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  I said, what should the new viral shirt be?
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  I want something like the Hillary for President shirt
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  that looks the same.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  He said, how about Trump pants 2020?
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  And I said, genius.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  And I said, also keeping America great.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  And on the back, it says America first in 1776.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  That's what a nation state is.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  That's what a country is.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  And so they act like it's dirty.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  Let's exercise our free speech.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  Let's get out there.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  If you pre-order the shirt, again, that you see Q wearing,
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  if you're a radio listener, go to infowars.com.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  For this last show, you can see the video feed.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  Or go to infowarsstore.com.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  You can see the shirt.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  And it's $9.95.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  Now, again, an XXXL large costs us like $7 a piece
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  or small costs us like $4.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  On average, they cost a little over $5.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  They're printed right here in the United States.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  They're high quality.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  You meet like-minded people.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  You spread the word.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  You stand up against those that want to try to intimidate
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  our free speech.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  You stand up against the globalist.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  And you fund the operation with a couple of dollars each shirt.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  But the solidarity of the shows, the power of the shows,
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  at the upcoming Trump rallies and the big mega rallies
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  he's going to have, this is the new shirt.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  And so we will ship these out in the next week and a half
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  or so as soon as they come in that they're being made right now.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  The 18-wheeler is going to be on its way.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  I'm told in two days.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  And so it's the great folks we've been using for over a decade
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  to make a lot of our shirts.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  And they're coming.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  So Trump pins 2020 Q.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  What do you think of the shirt?
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  Absolutely love the shirt.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  Red, white, and blue, you know, bearing true faith
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  and allegiance to the United States of America.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  America first, that's the whole point.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  We've been a great nation for a long time
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  and it's time to make it better again.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  It's time to not allow people to take away
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  our right of free speech.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  You know, they're loud.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  They're vocal.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  They love to talk about it.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  Let's do the same thing.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  And again, this is a shirt that isn't too shocking.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  It's classy.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  It looks good.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  And it's your right to wear it.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  I'm going to start wearing these shirts.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  I've got my proof that just came in.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  That's it you're wearing.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  I'm going to start wearing this sucker out there
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  because, you know, I wear it sometimes
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  and I just want to have the kids with me.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  It's got to be done.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  These people want to intimidate us.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  They want to get in our face.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  Hey, reality check.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  It's a guy trying to cut your taxes.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  The economy is already exploding for the little guy.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  The globalists are pissed because we finally have a president
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  that wants to actually be the president
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  and I'm a new world order globalist.
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  So get the shirt.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  And in closing, before we go back to Dr. Corsi here,

[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  that go back to them, taking us off Adroll and Google ads
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  where we go outside of the operation,
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  run ads, sell products to fund this information warfare system.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  We're proof of our secret weapon.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  And so those specials of 33% off, 40% off, 25% off
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  on the nutraceuticals and so many items
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  and water filtration systems, those are going to end.

[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  Unbelievable.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  These are so comfortable.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  They work so good in the shop or in the bad pollen or out in LA
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  with all the smog and the rest of it.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  It's incredible.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  We've got the RZ air filtration systems
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  with a replacement filters and more at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  That's our newest item.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  We only bring in the best.
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  Thank you, Cube.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  We'll be back.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  Want to thank you all for your support.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  Dr. Corsi, 70 Seconds Away.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  Visit GCN.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation.
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  Charlie Daniels.
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  He's always loved America.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  to the rest of the world.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  Individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you?
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  It's going to be coming after you're done.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  I think it ain't going to sit well down my way at all.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  It ain't going to sit well.
[1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  They lost.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  We won.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  Want to see what drums up against.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  It's time to ride, boys.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  We need a thousand pallet beers.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  Heritage.
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  Mom and apple pie.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  And beef was for supper.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  Revelation.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  Dawn of global government.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  The ethical screenings on demand.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  DVDs now available.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  Starring Alex Jones.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  Charlie Daniels.
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  Special ops general.
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  Jerry Boykin.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  Revelation.
[1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  The movie.info.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:51.000]  Let's fix it.
[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  Coming up.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  World government was to be run through healthcare
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  via the billable and the Gates Foundation with
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  Chelsea Clinton at the head.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  Just like they've got her in the foundation.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  She wrote a book, but they're not promoting it now.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  Because Hillary was supposed to get in.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  Amazing.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  That's coming up.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  Dr. Corsi, again, you are so prolific.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  It's great to have you on the team.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  I'm impressed.
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  A couple of articles a day.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  Major scoops you give us.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  It's really incredible.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  Just overall, where do you see Trump at right now?
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  I think he's over delivering.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  I don't want to be some cheerleader or a bootlicker,
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  like Spin Magazine called it.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  I'm just very pleased to see somebody working their
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  heart out like a lion to restore this republic.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  This is incredible.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  I agree.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  I think he's done tremendously fulfilling his promises.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  I think tonight's speech is going to be all the
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  advanced word we're getting on.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  It's going to be a very solid speech on delivering
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  on campaign promises.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  What's happening though is, you know,
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  the Obama forces are out mass.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  And this is a war.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  I'm going to be surprised tonight if there isn't
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  anything going on.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  There is, and heckling from the gallery,
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  completely inappropriate behavior that Democrats would
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  have gone up in arms about had anything been done
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  with Obama and his first speech, his first State of
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  the Union.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  The key element here is that the Obamacare is at the crux
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  of a lot of this.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  This was the government takeover,
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  global government takeover vehicle.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  And now we know from the articles we've been able
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  to produce here, which is really groundbreaking
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  and only info wars really covering the story.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  I'm going to kill Obamacare and make Paul Ryan do the
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  right thing.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  Get this article out, folks.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  Get it out.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  Your community bank ribs.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  Get it out to the news.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  Tell mainstream media, hey, get on this.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  Cover this.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  Because it's stealing from the average person in
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  mortgages, the mortgage giants, which we depend on,
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  stealing from the Fannie and Freddie,
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  and also doing it such that, you know,
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  the Obamacare was bankrupt and keeping that line
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  from the American people.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  Disrespecting the investors in Fannie and Freddie.
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  And this is going to be a big part of the speech tonight.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  I think Obama did not respect investment.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  He didn't respect small investor.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  You're going to see a turnaround where Donald Trump
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  knows that the economy depends on small companies
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  creating jobs and the small investor.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  Because this economy is not based on the gigantic
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  billionaires.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  It's based upon the hundreds of millions of Americans
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  who employ others, invest their money, buy properties.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  And Obama was undermining our health system
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  and our housing system.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  Sure.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  And looting it illegally.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  I mean, classical looting.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  Here's Joe Wilson at one of the State of the Union
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  saying that Obama, again, was lying about saying
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  that Obamacare wouldn't cover illegal aliens,
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  which we later learned it did.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  So they demonized this like it was the worst thing on Earth.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  They openly say they're planning 100 times this tonight.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  Here's Joe Wilson.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  here illegally.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  And then, of course, we have Jonathan Gruber, one of many
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  clips saying, thank God the American people are dumb
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  and don't have attention spans.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  Here's that.
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  It's just you can't do it politically.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  You just literally cannot do it.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  OK, transparent financing.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  Unless you have transparent financing,
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  it's also transparent spending.
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  I mean, this bill was written in a tortured way
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  OK, so it was written to do that.
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  In terms of risk-rated subsidies,
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  if you get a law which said healthy people are going to pay in,
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  it made explicit that healthy people pay in
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  and sick people get money, it would not have passed.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  OK, just like people, lack of transparency
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  is a huge political advantage.
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  or whatever.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  There you go.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  That's the arrogance.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  So let's never forget that.
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  Dr. Corsi, if you want to, you can pop in after the speech
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  tonight.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  We're going to have a live event.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  We're having Roger Stone on as well.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  Happy to.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  I'll be available all evening.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  And I think this is the whole Obamacare was based on a lie.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  And that line now we know stole from the mortgages of the country,
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  the mortgage giants, and investors in Fannie and Freddie.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  And it's intolerable.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  It's a much worse than we ever knew.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  Congratulations on breaking the scandal.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  Thank you, sir.
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  It's Ashley Beckford here for infowars.com,
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  the National Council of La Raza, an organization that promotes
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  the reconquista of the Southern United States
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  called President Trump's executive order,
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:19.000]  a quote, declaration of war on the Hispanic community,
[2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  equivalent to the slave trade.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  This organization, meaning the race, La Raza,
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  is promoting Make America Mexico again.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  The president of the National Council of La Raza
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  claimed the president's plan to build a wall on the southern border
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  and deport violent illegal immigrants will, quote,
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  tarnish our nation's character.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  The bottom line is this.
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  President Trump's decision to build a wall on the southern border
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  does not violate human rights.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  President Trump is protecting our borders from radical extremists
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  and criminal thugs.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  Stay tuned at infowars.com slash show for more immigration news.

[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  how young Jebedee and the products at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  Check it out for yourself today.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  Top Global is for Shadow, an epidemic, apocalyptic, biological attack.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  That's the sub-headline.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  I'm going to make that the main headline of the article on infowarsteam.com.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  Top Global is for Shadow, an apocalyptic, biological attack
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  that will, again, bring in total world government.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  Chelsea Clinton wrote a book where she was going to be the head
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  of the Bill and Melinda Gates program worldwide when her mother was president.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  That didn't happen, so now they're not promoting the book.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  This is huge.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  We're going to play this special report, and then we're going to,
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  just a few minutes for the balance of the hour, go to Gerald Salente
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  of Trends Research and The Trends Journal to break down.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  I want to get into the economy first, because he's really a smart guy.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  When it comes to that, best-selling author as well,
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  because, like Ron Paul said a month ago,
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  what Trump's doing is great for the economy, but it may be too little too late,
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  especially with how they're lined up trying to stop him.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  So we're going to talk to Gerald Salente who's got his finger on the pulse
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  of TrendsResearch.com here in just a moment.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  But first, this is a really important report that Rob Jacobson and Darren McBrain
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  put together, because it goes to the mindset, it goes to the system,
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  it goes to where the globalists are taking us and how they want to use
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  global pandemics and crises, many cases that they create.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  Oh yeah, the Bill and Melinda Gates have been caught doing all sorts of horrible stuff,
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  sterilants and vaccines, you name it. His dad was the head of Planned Parenthood.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  It's really deep stuff, my film Endgame,
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  blueprint for global enslavement that's free on YouTube, by the way, breaks it down.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  So here's this report, and then we're going to go to my friend, there he is right there,
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  Gerald Salente up there in Kingston, New York,
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  to get into all the important topics he's got.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  But here is this brief but important report that's on infowars.com.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  Please retweet it, please Facebook it.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  You're the reason these videos get millions of views when they do get millions of views,
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  and this one needs millions of views, here it is.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  Right now, the global elite are preparing for something big.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  It looks like they are in the final stages of positioning themselves
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  for a worldwide global pandemic.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  An event that they say is not a matter of if, but a matter of when it will happen.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  Now recently, we've noticed that Bill and Melinda Gates,
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  well they've been given a lot of speeches lately,
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  publicly warning that the world is at risk of a deadly outbreak.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  On February 18th at the Munich Security Conference,
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  they said that a bioterrorist could use a genetically engineered epidemic
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  that could kill up to 30 million people.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  We also face a new threat that the next epidemic has a good chance of originating
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  on a computer stream of a terrorist intent.
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  And still when it happens, he'll be a hero for telling us about it.
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  A highly deadly strain of flu.
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  Whether it occurs by the quirk of nature at the hand of a terrorist,
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  epidemiologists show through their models that a respiratory spread pathogen
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  would kill more than 30 million people in less than a year.
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  Head pause, I'm going to play most of the report but go to Slentay here in a minute
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  and I'll skip a break so we have more time.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  But if you study Bill Gates like I have and all the weird stuff he's into
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  and the bioweapons and how he gets funding in his own companies,
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  the government programs like BioShield,
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  you realize just how incredibly creepy all of this is
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  and how the very elites, he and Oprah Winfrey and others have met there in New York
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  covered by ABC News to discuss a bioweapon to reduce world's population
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  with what the UN openly calls for.
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  Then the guy that thinks we're stupid that writes books saying it's time to call the population
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  and has secret meetings with Ted Turner who says the same things
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  is here telling us get ready for it to come, get ready for it to happen.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  When it's our own government, other governments that shot the black people up with syphilis
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  and did all the secret nerve gas testing and radiation of homeless kids and orphans.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  I mean it's just like the devil is sitting in front of you telling you
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  that look out gremlins exist and that they're coming for you when he's the king of the gremlins.
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  Again, the full reports on infowars.com, let's go to some more of this,
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  but they're really hyping it right now, like right before 9-11, terrorism's coming
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:39.000]  and when it comes give all your rights up, big buildings are going to get blown up.
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  I saw Gary Hart and Warren Redmond on the hardball going,
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  something big's about to happen, probably in New York.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  Wait, it's just a big celebration of throwing it in our face.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  So here it is.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  The nation is known for its global vaccine programs
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  and the tragic incidents that left over 40,000 children paralyzed.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  Some children even died from the vaccines.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  The Gates Foundation's practices of bad science on innocent children
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  has compelled the Indian government to refuse funding from Bill Gates
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  and restrict their...
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  MSM does stuff like, the Washington Post did it again today,
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  they just sent a random article that I covered earlier, say,
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  Alex Jones says, Hillary Clinton murders children.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  And then again, tied to Pizza Gate.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  When I said she murdered children funding Al Qaeda and ISIS
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  and all these groups in the Middle East the last six years,
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  since the Arab Spring, which they admit they did, and Trump's right exposing it.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  So see how they misrepresent?
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  But while you're watching that video as a listener,
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  you see mainstream news, articles, documents,
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  as Darren McBreen proves everything he claims.
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  But see, the news will just take clips of what he said
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  and say that we said that when we're showing you CNBC.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  That's why I started putting the radio show on TV 16 years ago
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  because I was sick of people saying I was making stuff up.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  India scraps funding ties with Gates Foundation on immunization.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  Let's give a few more minutes and we're going to Gerald Salente.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  Here, relationship.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  Infowars has exhaustively covered the Gates family participation
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  in global eugenics schemes such as Planned Parenthood,
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  global vaccine failures, alliances with foundations such as the Rockefellers,
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  who sponsored dozens of population control centers,
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  as well as ominous quotes like this.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  First, we've got population.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care,
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  reproductive health services,
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  On January 18th, in an article titled,
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  Bill Gates is teaming up with world leaders
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  to stop the next deadly pandemic.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  Business Insider reported that governments from Germany,
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  Japan and Norway have pooled funds,
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  along with the Gates Foundation, to raise a total of $490 million,
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  which Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPA,
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  says will help finance the first five years of research and development.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  Bill Gates appeared at January 2017's Davos World Economic Forum,
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  flaunting his CEPA program.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  CVS News headline, Bill Gates on how to outsmart global epidemics.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is listed as a member of the World Health Organization,
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  which means the World Health Organization gets their money, in part, from Gates.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  If the chips fall, it's the foundations and trust funds
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  that want to be the ones sitting at the very top.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  So what's their next move?
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  Well, we could simply turn to their own actions and their own writings for the answers.
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  In early 2017, the Oxford Press released Governing Global Health,
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  Who Runs the World and Why, and it was authored by none other than Chelsea Clinton,
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  and co-authored by Debbie Sridhar.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  The book discusses the current global model of principal agency theory,
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  or public-private partnership funding,
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  and managing a coordinated response of a worldwide pandemic.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  Now in this book, Chelsea Clinton suggests ways that the request of those financing these plans
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  are heard loud and clear and acted upon appropriately.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  In the case of a world pandemic...
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  The full reports on infowars.com, it's excellent, it gets even more hardcore.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  Bottom line, they loot the government, they create a world government,
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  they get medical tyranny worldwide, make more corporate profits
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  that they didn't have tax exempt to carry out sterilization, population control, you name it.
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  Then they have meetings at Einstein University in New York,
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  and it leaks out that they're planning all this.
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  I cover it eight years ago from mainstream news, and nobody cares.
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  Talk about sensational.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  Now, joining us for the balance of the hour is Charles Solante of TrendsResearch.com.
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  He needs no introduction here.
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  And I've got a lot of questions I want to ask up front about the economy,
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  where he sees it going, where he sees the attempts to cause civil wars going,
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  even AFP admits that's the attempt happening in France right now,
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  as people fight back against globalism.
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  So we're going to cover some of that, but Gerald, what else do you want to break down?
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  What else are you looking at in new trends and developments?
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  Well, you know, just what you were talking about, the vaccines and the drugs,
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  and how, you know, the whole industry is really killing people,
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  and the products that you have on info wars that help people in whole health healing
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  are really what people should be focusing on as they see the sham on the other end.
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  You know, there was a drug, I'm not sure the name of it.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  It was in the late 1980s, up into the mid-1990s, late 90s,
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  that they were recommending that women take as they were going into menopause.
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  And then anybody that came out against it, like yourself or any others,
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  was attacked by the media.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  And of course, the media is zoned by the corporations.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  And I think it was progesterone or named something similar to that.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  And what they found out is that as they were pumping this stuff into women,
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  it was causing cancer.
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  But this is going on for decades.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  And anybody that came out against it was attacked.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  Sure was estrogen.
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  Estrogen, that was it. Thank you.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  And that's what's going on with this whole vaccination craze.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  It's merely there to make big pharma richer.
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  And the politicians, I mean, I worked up in Albany.
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  I was the assistant to the secretary of the New York State Senate
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  and was in the political scene for many years.
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  You don't need a lot of dough to buy these clowns off.
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  They like to call them campaign contributions, adults call them bribes and payoffs.
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  So now you were talking also, and all things connected, what was going on in France.
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  Let's just stay on the drug issue for a while
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  and what they're forcing parents to do in this country
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  by forcing the children to get vaccinated when they go into school.
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  Well, you know over there in Italy right now?
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  A new party, the five-star movement, Cinque Stella.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  You know what they're fighting against?
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  Forced vaccination of kids.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  While everybody else in this country is, shoot them up.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  Shoot them up.
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  Notice that Trump puts Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the head of this commission,
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  says that he has questions about vaccines,
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  obviously an issue reportedly that hadn't really been reported on with Barron,
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  that Barron's basically recovered from, thank God, but expanding on that.
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:56.000]  And then he has Robert De Niro, part of the commission.
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  We asked De Niro a week and a half ago if he appreciated Trump doing that
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:04.000]  and he basically said, no, I don't like Donald Trump.
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  To me, that's like a big fat baby who runs around saying he wants to beat up Trump
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  with all this made up stuff.
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  I'm trying to bash Robert De Niro.
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  It's just that if you really look at what Trump's really doing,
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  he really is, I'm sorry, on almost every front,
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  really trying to deliver to the people.
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  So I want to ask you about that.
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  Consumer Confidence sourced a 15-year high.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  We've got mom and pop investors are behind the historic market rally.
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  Bloomberg has to admit that.
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  Meanwhile, Trump, you know, trying to get our power prices down,
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  trying to get, you know, clawback some of the corporate income tax.
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  Everything I see Trump doing is common sense,
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  not making you get Obamacare, signing executive order to the IRS
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  can't give you a $5,000 fine.
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  But hardly any of that ever hits the news.
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  We just hear that he's this horrible, racist, evil person.
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  I know you're a political atheist, you know, don't like both parties.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  Well, it seems like Trump is running him over as against both parties.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  He has both parties against him.
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  He has the establishment against him, the big banks against him.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  And then all these so-called liberals run around claiming he's the establishment.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  What do you think, Gerald?
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  Well, he's not the establishment at all.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  And the reason the markets are going up is because, again,
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  the things that you mentioned, Consumer Confidence,
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  small business confidence is that it took its biggest spike since 1980.
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  That's when Ronald Reagan got elected.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  That was after Stagflation and Jimmy Loser Carter.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  You know, the guy that gave us, by the way, the Mujahideen,
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  that then became Al Qaeda that everybody forgets about.
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  And also the guy, you know, remember the Iran hostage crisis.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  So after that, Reagan comes in, boom, the economy zaps.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  That's the same emotion.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  Because now the business of America is business.
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  And the business of America, since Clinton, really.
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  I mean, he was the Iraq war, the Yugoslav war, you know, the Bosnian war.
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  And then he was bombing Iraq three times a week.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  And then Bush comes in with the war on terror, Afghan, Iraq war.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  Obama keeps them going.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  And now we have someone that talks about business first and what happened yesterday.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  They brought in Wilbur Ross as the Commerce Secretary.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  He was finally okay.
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  It's the cabinet position.
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  You like Wilbur Ross? Do you think he's a ruthless business guy?
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  Maybe.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  But guess what?
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  If he's going to work on behalf of we, the people,
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  in renegotiating these lousy trade deals,
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  and they are terrible trade deals,
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  and I'll make that really clear just to put some facts.
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  Let's be clear.
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  I mean, they admit our government has sold America out.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  That's their business is doing lousy trade deals
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  where they get positions for themselves and their wives
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  and their families on the corporate boards
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  of the Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and 160 other countries.
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  Our literal wealth, as you know, in the 1960s,
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  was more than half the global GDP.
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  Now we're way below that.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  We have been sold out.
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  So all Trump's got to do is take the globalist foot off our neck
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  and we're going to explode, aren't we?
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  That's exactly it.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  And that's why the markets are going up.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  And again, as you know, I'm a political atheist.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  And Trump got in and it's on, in fact, it's in writing.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  It's in our broadcasts.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  Five days afterwards, and I saw the market going up.
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  We did a 180 on our economic forecast.
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  You said ongoing from being very negative,
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  which they admitted global depression basically this year,
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  that was admitted that you were saying,
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  now we're boom.
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  And that's my next question for you because you were right.
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  You know, who thought when, you know,
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  50 billion had come in the first few days,
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  it'd be, you know, 2 trillion, 300 billion,
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  or whatever it is now.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  You probably have that number.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  You're always on top those numbers.
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  Gerald Salente, Trends Forecaster.
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  What do you make then of Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs,
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:55.000]  JPMorgan, all bad-mouthing the market,
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  saying it's over, death spiral, implosion.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  I have those headlines here today doing everything they can
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  to suppress it because they want a controlled market,
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  even though they've made huge profits because of what Trump's done.
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  They want full control.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  And so who will be successful?
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  Because Ron Paul was almost a month ago.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  He was an economist, as you know, from the Von Mies Institute.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  And he says, you know, that he thinks it could be too little, too late.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  He said, what Trump's doing is wonderful.
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  He doesn't usually get praise.
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  But he said, globally, we're facing something so big,
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  he doesn't know if it can be staved off.
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  So a lot of people are rooting for Trump to fail.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  A lot of people on the streets are.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  They hate him so much.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  They have no idea he's actually trying to save their butt.
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  So what do you make of that?
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  And will Trump be successful?
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  Or is it really up to us to make sure he's successful?
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  Now, he'll be successful, again, going to a guy like Wilbur Ross.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  Now, just to put this into perspective,
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  when I say the trade deal is a lousy,
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  because I'm not making this up,
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  there was a thing called the chicken tax.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  And what happened back in the 1960s
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  is that the United States was dumping a lot of cheap poultry into Europe,
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  particularly Germany.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  In retaliation, Germany raised the import tax as a chicken coming in.
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  LBJ, President Johnson, put on a chicken tax.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  If you're going to bring Volkswagen's into the United States,
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  particularly those van size ones, little buses,
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  we're going to put a 23% tax on all of them.
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  And they did.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  And he was smart.
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  He picked a hot item that was the best selling car that year.
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  I remember reading about that.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  And he said, I'm going to put a tax on it.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  And did it stop Volkswagen's from bringing them in?
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  No.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  No.
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  And what happened?
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  Then they kept that tax on until Slimer,
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  slick, willy sellout Clinton,
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  that miserable little boy of a nothing with a bad attitude
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  and a lot of lies and blood on his hands brought us after.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  And how good that all those liberals love.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  They forgot about that debate with Ross Perot, didn't they?
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  When he warned of the great sucking sound of our jobs
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  leaving the country.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  Boy, was Ross Perot not proven absolutely dead on?
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  So you can have these tariffs.
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  They're not a dirty word.
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  The only thing that free trade has given,
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  it's not fair trade, it's slave trade.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  It is.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  It's a giant sucking sound, the lowest common denominator
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  that is Chinese slaves in literal death camps.
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  We cannot compete with that.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  It's a giant sucking sound to the lowest common denominator.
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  And you make one side of deals, you get screwed over.
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  We've seen what happens.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  And so Trump is individually, as you know,
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  renegotiating each deal.
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  And every day major industries are coming back.
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  This is incredible.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  Then I hear Nancy Pelosi on ABC News last night saying,
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  he hasn't done one thing for jobs.
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  She said, quote, one thing.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  I mean, what planet is she living on?
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  Nancy Pelosi or Minnie Mouse?
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  I mean, who are you talking about?
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  I mean, what is she?
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  I mean, there's another one born on third base
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  and thought she had a home run.
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  Her old man was in the business of a politician
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  and she just found her way in there.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  What has Nancy Pelosi ever done?
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  Any of them.
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  Pelosi, not so far inside.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  By the way, she looks completely insane.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  You always talk about how Alex is not too conspiratorial.
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  It's all out in the open.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  There are a bunch of losers who are, you know,
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  just handed everything, white shoe boys,
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  as you said, silver spoon, all of it.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  I watch Pelosi, people like Waters.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  I'm sure you've seen her in press conferences
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  where they say George W. Bush is still president
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  in the same press conference
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  and that Putin and Trump invaded Korea.
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  She doesn't say North or South Korea.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  These people are completely out of their minds.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  How about, look her up on YouTube.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  I guaranteed Donald Trump is not going to be president
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  to the United States.
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  You remember her saying that how many times?
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  So again, going back to the whole crew
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  and putting the whole picture together.
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  It's not only the Democrats.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  I mean, it's little Paulie Ryan.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  Oh, he's the worst.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  Yeah, what was he?
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  Was he Eddie Munster before this?
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  So I'm saying there's no one there.
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  I agree.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  So I mean, I think they won't stop the rally
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  at least here because we're the best position,
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  you know, the best worst house in a bad neighborhood.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  But if you expand on that, then we'll come back
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  and let you elaborate.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  Gerald Salenta here.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  How does it go then?
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  The polls show everybody hates what the Democrats are doing,
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  at least the majority.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  Trump's getting more popular even in skewed polls.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  It's blowing up in their face.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  Prosperity's coming back.
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  What are they going to do as it dawns on them?
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  And what is Trump doing letting them
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  in hundreds of newspapers every week saying killing?
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  I mean, I've never seen a bunch of wimps like this
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  going around looking for a fight.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  Well, again, you mentioned De Niro.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  To me, he's a little low life, nothing.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  He has to live far from over here.
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  He has to come and punch me in the face
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  because I think he's a low life.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  I don't like these little Italian boys
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  or partially Italian
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  that keep promoting lousy mafia movies.
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  I don't like these kind of guys.
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  So anyway, he's just a fat mouth.
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  And when you talked about his child having autism,
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:12.000]  and then you remember, he pulled that movie
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  out of the Tribeca Film Festival.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  Because maybe the guy that talks tough
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  has a little pair of cojones smaller than a moth ball.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  Because only a little boy would be a coward
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  to pull those movies.
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  You're on a roll, Gerald.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  Let's come back and talk about that.
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  He won't even thank Trump for trying to put him
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  in a commission to help kids.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  It's just exactly...
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:36.000]  And we thought he was going to lose money
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  in that event is when he pulled it.
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  So I guess money's more important than this kid.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  I don't want to bash De Niro, but it is true.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  He runs around everywhere talking about
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  attack Trump physically, so he deserves...
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  he deserves for what you just said.
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  I think we'll be right back with Gerald Salante.
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  Stay with us.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  And we'll also tell you about his latest trends alerts.
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  We're on the march.
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:54.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:30:17.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:26.000]  That's right, guys.
[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:28.000]  Male breasts and soy.
[2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  And the rest of us are on the run.
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  So the new Roasted Patty is made with real chicken.
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  Subway was among five fast food restaurants
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  whose chicken the Canadian Broadcast Corporation
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  had tested.
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:42.000]  The Subway sandwich chain has refuted the results
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  of the DNA test in a release statement.
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:46.000]  In case you're wondering what the heck was in the rest
[2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:48.000]  of those patties and chicken strips, it's soy.
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:51.000]  Multiple studies have shown eating soy products
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:54.000]  are the best way to get rid of soy.
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:30:55.000]  That's right, guys.
[2:30:55.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  Male breasts and summers coming.
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:30:59.000]  Fight the information war and buy
[2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:01.000]  SuperMailVitality

[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:03.000]  Today we call it bone broth.
[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com,
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth,
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  in a single great tasting formula, Caveman.
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  that are our superior ancestors.
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:34.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking,
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  but you used the bones for strength,
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  from the outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:44.000]  to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were,
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:55.000]  that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:57.000]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman,
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:33:21.000]  ultimate paleo formula for yourself and ForWarsLife.com today.
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  This ought to be our theme song.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  I got no friends because they read the papers.
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  They can't be seen with me.
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  You know it's funny though, back when he produced this song in the 1970s.
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  If the papers were attacking you, you were destroyed.
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  If 60 minutes of attacking you were destroyed.
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  Now, when they attack you, they lie about you, they nitpick you.
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  People love you because MSM is dead.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  I want to talk about that with Gerald.
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  If you go back and read some of the books he wrote in the 1980s,
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:08.000]  I remember my dad reading his books in the 1980s
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  and he predicted so much of what's now come to pass.
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  Thank God they were able to manipulate the economy
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  to not have the bubble completely implode
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  like most experts agreed it would until Trump got in.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  And I hope he can stave it off, but I've studied the economy.
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  The economy is only trying to deliver funds and jobs
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  in two real communities.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  He's making it about people and bringing the workers up again
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  and saying this is about humanity and this is about
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  Main Street and small towns and big cities and cold miners
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  and farmers and teachers and auto mechanics and factory workers
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  and dock workers and artists and in quality.
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  Slinty for decades is obsessed with dressing nice
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  and respecting yourself and just look what Trump does
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  and it's bringing all that back.
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  I'm going to go back to him here in just a moment,
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  finish up with DeNiro, but also Trump just signed a bill
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  for empowerment through legislation to promote women in business.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  So just a lot of exciting things and anybody will tell you
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  he's gotten awards for putting more women in management positions
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  than anybody else in the hotel and golf course businesses
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  and of course he's been given awards for hiring record numbers
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  of black people and let them move up from the very bottom
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  just like women or anybody else right to the top.
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  That's what Trump wants and I'm just...
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  I don't listen to him in fun.
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  He's not perfect on a few things but he's so real
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  and is doing what he says.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  Even if I disagree with some of it, it's so genuine
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  to see the return of that.
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  We haven't seen this in a very long time.
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  We're going back to Gerald here in a moment.
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  Before I go any further, you know,
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  Google banned us through their Adroll subsidiary.
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  It's a separate company, right?
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  That's the company you have to go through to get on Google.
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  We've been running ads with them for three years.
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  Gerald's got his own stories about Google
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  that other people take as identity and do stuff
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  and almost destroy his operation.
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  But anyways, just do whatever they want
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  and they're now censoring us in the ratings as well
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  with our articles and they promise they do this
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  and Facebook and Twitter are doing it as well.
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  People say, well, that's their own platform.
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  No, we follow their rules. We're legitimate news organizations.
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  They're supposed to give you whatever the hottest thing is.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  That's what drives us to the top. They don't do that.
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  But I'm digressing.
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  For everybody that signs up for our free newsletter,
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  you get articles, you get videos that are exclusive every day,
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  but you also get discounts just because if things really implode,
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  we can still contact you via email.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  That's the last frontier, even if they shut off info works.
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  And that's the direction they're going.
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  50% off deep cleanse.
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  It is the amazing all-in-one using a whole bunch
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  of different known proprietary herbs
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  that are in deep cleanse to purify and cleanse out the body.
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  Deep cleanse is one of our best sellers,
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  but it's sold out all the time because it's so hard to get all the proprietary
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  organic ingredients that are in it.
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  So go to infowars.com.

[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  one of a kind.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  Again, honestly, one of a kind.
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  It's like 2001, 500, the other,
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  but these are original print size, color, all of it
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  by the amazing artist who is the official sketcher
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  and a person for the Republican Party.
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  In fact, you'll recognize the famous Ronald Reagan drawing.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  Those are available right now about to sell out
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  in only $19.95, parchment paper,
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  come in a nice tube, transport it to your door.

[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  And we have the new Trump Pintz 2020 shirt.
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  We're launching it now to trigger control freaks everywhere
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  that try to bully Americana, America First supporters.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  So that new shirt, Trump Pintz 2020,
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  keeping America great on the front, on the back.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  America First in 1776.
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  Yeah, it's okay to have a country.
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  It's okay to be sovereign.
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  Glenn Beck comes out on Ask Gerald about this
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  on CNN last week and says,
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  it's very scary to talk about nationalism
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  and economic nationalism.
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  Bannon's scary.
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  That's like saying it's scary, you know,
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  for fish to live in the ocean
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  or for birds to fly in the sky.
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  We have to have a country.
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  We've gotten this upside down world
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  where they're trying to force feed us this narrative
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  that it's dirty to have a country.
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  So I've been ranting, of course, people should go
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  and get your sign up for your free news alert
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  or sign up for the publication, the Trends Journal.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  They can do that at TrendsResearch.com.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  But getting back, that's quite a cornucopia
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  that I just laid out there, Gerald.
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  But what do you want to tackle first?
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  Well, first of all, I like to say about your products
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  and I buy them.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  So I recommend to everyone to consider...
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  Don't you have a degree in that or something?
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  Yeah, I have an honorary doctorate of law
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  from the National University of Health Sciences
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  for the work I've done in integrative
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  and complementary medicine.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  I mean, you've had so many best sellers,
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  didn't you write one of the main best sellers on herbs?
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  Well, it was called Natural Healing.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  Back in 1986, it was a Warner book.
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  So I've been very much involved in this
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  and I use your product.
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  Well, thank you for the support.
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  And for people to stay healthy in this poison planet,
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  I would suggest you consider building your immune system.
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  Plus, people have got to support the Trends Journal
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  and hand the magazine out
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  because they may know a lot of this stuff.
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  Their friends and family don't.
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  And they've got to support platforms that are under attack
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  because that was my next question.
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  What are they going to do about that?
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  Well, let me finish on the economy
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  because it ties in a lot to your first guest as well.
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  Corsi is his name.
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  Yes, Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:00.000]  Yes, and he was talking about Obamacare.
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  What this is that people aren't putting into connection.
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  You remember another thing called too big to fail.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  Yes.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  All right, in capitalism, there's no such thing as too big to fail.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  You rise and fall on your own merits.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  This is not a failure of capitalism.
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  Then you go back to Obamacare.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  Sure, it's like people like Pelosi
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  who doesn't know what world she's on and Obama.
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  Totally lazy.
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  You do whatever he wants, you know, ripping us off,
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  telling us they're geniuses, as you always say.
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  And then what happens is we're being forced under Obamacare.
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  First of all, the pay of penalty and taxes,
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  but the bigger one being forced to buy insurance
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  from a private company.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  That's called what I just said, too big to fail and Obamacare.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers,
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  which by definition is called fascism.
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  And then when you talk about why the liberals don't complain,
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  and again, all of these protests week after week,
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  what are they protesting?
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  Where were they when Obama was destroying Libya,
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  killing 30, 40,000 people?
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  All these little liberals had locked jaw.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  How about Hillary Clinton? A sod has to go.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  Gaddafi has to go.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  Oh, that's all right.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  We'll forget about that because we're little low-life hypocrites
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  that have no courage.
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  And then you keep going on.
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  How about Obama, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner?
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  As soon as he gets it, bam, more troops into Afghanistan.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  No, I know the ones the liberals love the most.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  I'm really good at killing people, quoted in the book,
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  Double Down, over 4,000 innocent people killed by Obama.
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  And he thinks it's tough that he orders the drone strikes,
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  claims he's anti-war, launches more wars than Bush and Clinton combined,
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  but it's okay because, well, he's African-American.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  And then again, tying it all together, you asked why they do it,
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  and the reason is the same reason why people are in abusive relationships.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  They call themselves party members, little kids,
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  calling themselves party members to a party that they're never invited to, of course,
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  party only steals from them that a murder is in.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  I was about to say, isn't it that modern leftists,
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  because we're not left-wing or right-wing, obviously,
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  are like wannabe club members, like saying they're royalty,
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:40.000]  they're just delusional, and they're anti-free speech,
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  and they don't get they're being ripped off by the very so-called leaders
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  they defend and worship, it's make-believe.
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  Exactly. And I said, I'm saying they're in an abusive relationship.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  Their husband or wife kills, and it's okay with them.
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:01.000]  So then tying this all together about too big to fail
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  and going back into what Corsi said about Obamacare,
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:07.000]  the merger of state and corporate powers,
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  and where the economy is going.
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  We believe there's going to be...
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  The Trends Journal just came out today, the new edition,
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  and it's in there, briefly, is going to be a market correction.
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  No question about it. You don't have a boom like this
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  in any kind of condition, no matter who's there without a correction.
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  And by the way, Farber and a lot of other people are saying that,
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  and they're saying it's not Trump's fault.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  But what we're saying is that it's not going to be a crash.
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  It'll be a market correction.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  And then the if, if Trump sticks by and does,
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  and we can't say if he's not or is going to continue it,
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  but if he, and again, like them or not, not the issue,
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  if he goes with his tax cuts that he's promising,
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  if he does the deregulations that he says he's going to do,
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  and if he goes into the infrastructure program that he says,
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  if he brings back jobs to America,
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  then yes, the correction will be just that,
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  a correction and then a bounce back,
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  and that's in our latest Trends Journal.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:20.000]  Now, bringing it back to Jeff Beck and talking about
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:22.000]  how dare we be nationalistic,
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  go back to our top trends of 2016.
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  And one of the top one was a self-sustaining economy.
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  So in one time, for example, in New York area,
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  you had over 300,000 people in the garment industry.
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  And that's exactly what Trump's saying.
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  We're going to have trade,
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  but we're also going to have local inner-city trade
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  between cities, between counties, between states.
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  We're going to have investment that creates those microeconomies
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  that always created that amazing richness of America.
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:58.000]  Again, 98% of our clothing comes from overseas.
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  Sure, let's just say it, though, Gerald.
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:01.000]  I mean, so much of what Trump says and does
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  is exactly what you've been saying for decades.
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  I mean, I mean, I know you were kind of neutral on Trump
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  early on in the election,
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:10.000]  but I mean, is it not surreal to see how much he's delivering
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  on classic Americana populism?
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  Yes, it is.
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  It's real in that sense.
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:17.000]  And those are the things I agree with him on,
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  on the war fronts, the whole different issue, as you know.
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  But it's talking about the economy.
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  And again, not what I like or don't like.
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  It's what is.
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  And the what is, he's building confidence.
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  That's why you are seeing the markets go up.
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  And not only our markets,
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  but emerging markets that was submerging.
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  Yeah, the whole world's demonizing him
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  because the globalists control those markets.
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  But the whole system's rising,
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  despite all their attacks,
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  the whole world ought to be thanking Trump.
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  On the economy, yes.
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  And Americans should be thanking him.
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  But you see where they're going wrong
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  is they just keep about immigration.
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  Go back again to the Great Depression.
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  Nobody was allowed to come in.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  It wasn't about Mexico.
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  You couldn't come in from Italy.
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  You couldn't come in from Germany.
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  You couldn't come in from anywhere.
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  We couldn't take care of our own.
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  Once you take care of your own,
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:17.000]  exactly how are we supposed to take record numbers of immigrants
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  which we've been doing that are unskilled or handicapped
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  when we're already falling apart.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  And speaking of falling apart,
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  CNN has almost no ratings except when Trump's on.
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  I thought it was smart.
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  He said no to the White House Correspondence Center
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  that's about the president.
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  They want to use it as a, you know, sniping attack, a trap.
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  You know, also they said, hey, some of these press conferences,
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  we're going to let other independent media in
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  and not always let CNN or Buzzfeed
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  to put out fake dossiers on.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  And they bitch and complain because they're so entitled.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  I want you to comment on both those.
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  And then CNN comes out in a new whopper of really hilarity.
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  So it's kind of a heavy subject.
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  I almost have some entertainment here.
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  You know, kind of a laugh break.
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:59.000]  CNN claims they do not root for any president
[2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:01.000]  as they demonize Trump and fawn after Obama.
[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:02.000]  Here it is.
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:05.000]  Seems to me there's a reason that they were blocked.
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:06.000]  Again, that's really troubling.
[2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:09.000]  And on the flip side, you look at those who are allowed in.
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:25.080]  verso Algeria,чи
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:29.080]  I've seen this administration in the deck with friendlier,
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:30.080]  news outlets.
[2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:32.080]  And when it's a friendlier, what I mean are,
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:35.080]  news outlets that have a point of view in some cases
[2:47:35.080 --> 2:47:36.580]  are openly rooting for the president.
[2:47:36.580 --> 2:47:38.000]  We don't see.
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:38.880]  See it.
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:41.760]  So let's put the facts into place.
[2:47:41.760 --> 2:47:42.760]  What's that guy?
[2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:43.760]  We have WikiLeaks.
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:48.680]  We have all the memos where they give the questions at press conferences to CNN to ask,
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:51.240]  to the New York Times to ask.
[2:47:51.240 --> 2:47:52.960]  They're giving her the debate questions.
[2:47:52.960 --> 2:47:54.360]  They're rigging everything.
[2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:56.560]  They're totally rooting for Hillary and the rest of it.
[2:47:56.560 --> 2:47:57.560]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:47:59.720]  I'll go back to that guy's stuff and awfulness.
[2:47:59.720 --> 2:48:02.320]  Who did he work for?
[2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:03.320]  The Clintons.
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:07.240]  What's that guy little Chucky Todd?
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:10.560]  On Meet the Prestitudes.
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:11.560]  What did he say?
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:14.120]  Oh, that they were too easy on Clinton.
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:16.120]  Oh, that's a fact.
[2:48:16.120 --> 2:48:18.480]  But I mean, Clinton's running them.
[2:48:18.480 --> 2:48:20.880]  Clinton was actually running them and telling them what headlines they have.
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:21.880]  That's what I'm saying.
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:26.120]  How does he get away with saying- And then what I'm saying though, he worked for a Democrat
[2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:27.120]  too.
[2:48:27.120 --> 2:48:28.120]  Exactly.
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:29.520]  And that's what I'm saying.
[2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:32.960]  They've all been in bed with the parties.
[2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:37.080]  So they're going after Trump because he's cutting them out.
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:39.320]  Making up the old system.
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:45.920]  And that's when they made up the whole fake news story, when the media lost.
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:48.000]  That's when they made, you go right back.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:53.760]  It's right after Trump gets elected, boom, they start hitting with fake news.
[2:48:53.760 --> 2:48:59.760]  They are the fake news propagandists, the people that gave us all these words, but we won't
[2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:00.760]  go into that.
[2:49:00.760 --> 2:49:03.680]  By the way, after Jimmy Carter was crushed by Ronald Reagan, that's when they created
[2:49:03.680 --> 2:49:05.320]  CNN to prop up the Democratic Party.
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:06.960]  I mean, Ted Turner admitted that.
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:13.720]  The claim that CNN doesn't root for anybody, when CNN on their own admissions was founded
[2:49:13.720 --> 2:49:17.160]  for the Democratic Party, this is ridiculous.
[2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:22.400]  And again, as you mentioned, the facts are there with WikiLeaks.
[2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:28.680]  They were giving Hitler-Reedy questions before the debates, the town hall meetings.
[2:49:28.680 --> 2:49:32.520]  And then again, with NBC, with that meet the prostitute guy.
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:33.520]  Sure.
[2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:35.200]  So when we come back, I want to ask you this question.
[2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:36.640]  How will the mainstream media die?
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:40.440]  I think Trump kicking them out, not going to correspondence centers, kind of the final
[2:49:40.440 --> 2:49:45.120]  tombstone that the facade's about to fall over with the next big win, and what comes
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:46.120]  out of that.
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:50.320]  But first, here's Trump a few weeks ago saying, the whole Russia thing is a ruse.
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:52.720]  Now the head of the intelligence committee comes out and says, there's not even phone
[2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:53.720]  calls.
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:49:54.720]  There's no evidence.
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:50:00.200]  We just kept hearing this from Brennan, who's a Wahhabist, none of it was true.
[2:50:00.200 --> 2:50:01.200]  Here's the president.
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:02.200]  Can you just say that?
[2:50:02.200 --> 2:50:03.200]  Russia is a ruse.
[2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:05.800]  I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important.
[2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:07.720]  Russia is a ruse.
[2:50:07.720 --> 2:50:09.840]  I have nothing to do with Russia.
[2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:12.720]  Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years.
[2:50:12.720 --> 2:50:14.200]  Don't speak to people from Russia.
[2:50:14.200 --> 2:50:15.200]  Not that I wouldn't.
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:16.200]  I just have nobody to speak to.
[2:50:16.200 --> 2:50:17.200]  No, stop right there.
[2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:19.800]  The young Turks came out and said, he's a liar.
[2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:23.600]  He knows Roger Stone, who's a Russian agent, though that's never been proven.
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:26.040]  And now they've had to come out and admit none of that's even there.
[2:50:26.040 --> 2:50:27.680]  Not on stone, none of them.
[2:50:27.680 --> 2:50:28.680]  Zero.
[2:50:28.680 --> 2:50:32.080]  Stone in the 80s helped roll up a Soviet spiness in Washington, D.C.
[2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:34.080]  It's the biggest load of crap the world's ever seen.
[2:50:34.080 --> 2:50:35.080]  Joe, we're going out to break.
[2:50:35.080 --> 2:50:36.080]  What do you say to that?
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:43.240]  Well, again, you know, the Democrats, don't they love war, no peace with Russia.
[2:50:43.240 --> 2:50:47.680]  We got to make America hate again.
[2:50:47.680 --> 2:50:50.560]  When Russia is only trying to stabilize itself, it's not even...
[2:50:50.560 --> 2:50:51.560]  I'm just saying...
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:54.880]  No, I agree, but I mean, Russia's doing nothing, and that's why they won't have a war with
[2:50:54.880 --> 2:50:58.160]  it, because I think they can push Russia around with all those countries that are around it,
[2:50:58.160 --> 2:50:59.160]  the Europe borders.
[2:50:59.160 --> 2:51:00.160]  Great points, Gerald.
[2:51:00.160 --> 2:51:29.160]  We'll be back on the other side.
[2:51:29.160 --> 2:51:30.160]  Thanks for watching.
