[00:39.280 --> 00:46.000]  pits a representative congressman out of pennsylvania on the house floor now i've
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.640]  been going through a ton of footage i gotta be honest i haven't been listening
[00:48.640 --> 00:52.560]  to the show lately i've just been doing so much work not only on my movie but
[00:52.560 --> 00:56.480]  working on obama too which is just shaping up to be a masterpiece just an
[00:56.480 --> 00:59.360]  unbelievable picture i really hope people get out there and support it like
[00:59.360 --> 01:02.480]  they did the first one let's support it ten times over because i think that this
[01:02.480 --> 01:06.240]  movie is going to be even stronger as we go through more and more footage more
[01:06.240 --> 01:10.320]  and more current events and are really able to analyze it for you in a way
[01:10.320 --> 01:14.400]  that only a movie can do unfortunately people don't read it doesn't have the
[01:14.400 --> 01:18.320]  big effect so i like i said haven't been listening to the show but pits on the
[01:18.320 --> 01:24.560]  floor calling out the eugenics program of population control let me repeat that
[01:24.560 --> 01:27.680]  calling out the eugenics program of population control
[01:27.680 --> 01:31.920]  and calling out judge ginsburg on her eugenics comments
[01:31.920 --> 01:35.200]  and i really wanted to show people the video i'm really liking these one
[01:35.200 --> 01:38.960]  minute speeches lately uh there was a clip we just pulled for the
[01:38.960 --> 01:41.760]  obama deception uh where i think it's longer in
[01:41.760 --> 01:47.280]  is talking about the elites and them using again global warming as a tool to
[01:47.280 --> 01:51.120]  control the population because that's what it is really talking about their
[01:51.120 --> 01:54.880]  fear mongering saying oh in 92 or 96 months which
[01:54.880 --> 01:58.480]  equivalent of eight years the world is going to end he talks about prince
[01:58.480 --> 02:03.440]  charles and this royalty this bourgeoisie this elite that again
[02:03.440 --> 02:07.440]  want to control us through the fear of global warming i mean
[02:07.440 --> 02:12.160]  this climate bill is out of control it's over the top this healthcare bill
[02:12.160 --> 02:15.600]  which really does tie into pits as comments about eugenics where they're
[02:15.600 --> 02:20.240]  stating that they can have interventions in private homes
[02:20.240 --> 02:23.520]  interventions that they're going to knock on your door and say take the shot
[02:23.520 --> 02:27.760]  or go to jail now this is this is unheard of and it's
[02:27.760 --> 02:32.320]  going to be federally funded in fact i have um subsections of the bill that i
[02:32.320 --> 02:34.880]  i'm really just going to have to read i mean title three of the bill is
[02:34.880 --> 02:38.480]  entitled improving the health of the american people it includes four
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.480]  subtitles they are a modernizing disease prevention of public

[02:57.440 --> 03:00.160]  shots maybe you can't live in the neighborhood anymore
[03:00.160 --> 03:03.520]  and of course d support for prevention and public
[03:03.520 --> 03:06.880]  health information and then it tells you in

[08:19.280 --> 08:22.560]  clip of joseph pitts a representative out of pennsylvania
[08:22.560 --> 08:27.520]  really calling out the elites eugenics program and ginsburg judge ginsburg in
[08:27.520 --> 08:31.280]  particular so let's go to the clip right now
[08:33.840 --> 08:36.720]  thank you for what purpose is the gentleman from pennsylvania
[08:36.720 --> 08:40.400]  gentleman's recognized mr. speaker last week's new york times magazine
[08:40.400 --> 08:44.480]  featured an interview with supreme court justice ruthbader ginsburg
[08:44.480 --> 08:48.400]  some of her comments were absolutely astonishing coming from a sitting supreme
[08:48.400 --> 08:51.600]  court justice but the most disturbing comment came in
[08:51.600 --> 08:55.120]  reference to abortion in reference to roe v wade
[08:55.120 --> 08:58.480]  the infamous supreme court case she said this quote
[08:58.480 --> 09:01.840]  frankly i thought that at the time roe was decided
[09:01.840 --> 09:06.080]  there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in
[09:06.080 --> 09:10.160]  populations that we don't want to have too many of
[09:10.160 --> 09:13.840]  in quote i cannot imagine any acceptable context
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.000]  and what a serious person could refer to populations that we don't want too
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.360]  many of this eugenic way of thinking debases the
[09:21.360 --> 09:25.200]  value of all human life all people people are created equal
[09:25.200 --> 09:28.800]  and deserve the most fundamental right to life no matter what race religion or
[09:28.800 --> 09:32.080]  socio-economic background i am shocked that a member of the
[09:32.080 --> 09:35.360]  supreme court believes that a compelling reason for the
[09:35.360 --> 09:39.680]  legality of abortion is because our society wants to reduce the growth
[09:39.680 --> 09:44.720]  of specific populations justice ginsburg's comments are an assault
[09:44.720 --> 09:48.640]  and insult to the values of the american people are you back
[09:48.640 --> 09:53.360]  amen brothers expired with purposes of gentleman folks i mean
[09:53.360 --> 09:57.200]  exactly all men are created equal you should not be debasing
[09:57.200 --> 10:04.640]  any population based on race creed uh economic situation it's absolutely
[10:04.640 --> 10:08.000]  ludicrous you know you can come up from nothing folks
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.880]  you just have to believe in yourself you have to work towards a goal
[10:10.880 --> 10:15.680]  you gotta stop sitting on your hands and why me and crying and
[10:15.680 --> 10:19.600]  eating bonbons on the couch watching jerry springer and ellen all day
[10:19.600 --> 10:23.360]  i mean that's the bottom line get off your duff and do something there are
[10:23.360 --> 10:27.040]  so many victories that we've had and what there there've been some losses lately
[10:27.040 --> 10:32.480]  by the way i mean big time although never passed the climate bill they did it
[10:32.480 --> 10:35.040]  now it's going to the senate oh we'll never pass in the senate well if we
[10:35.040 --> 10:37.440]  don't do something it's going to pass in the senate
[10:37.440 --> 10:41.360]  although never bringing a judge who openly writes a book called
[10:41.360 --> 10:46.720]  america's deadly obsession and no one will call her out on it a book that
[10:46.720 --> 10:50.720]  literally says that we don't have a second amendment and only the military
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.520]  should have firearms and nobody says anything on the floor while she's going
[10:55.520 --> 10:59.680]  to be the next supreme court justice they're just
[10:59.680 --> 11:02.880]  going to confirm her it looks like it's on a fast
[11:02.880 --> 11:06.160]  track and they want to keep going to that uh wise latina woman
[11:06.160 --> 11:09.040]  all right well if you're going to go to the liat wise latina woman comment
[11:09.040 --> 11:12.240]  why don't you take it the step further the step that needs to be taken and say
[11:12.240 --> 11:16.560]  wait a minute what's really disturbing is you're a member of la ras but not just
[11:16.560 --> 11:22.560]  a member a council member which is an organization solely based on race
[11:22.560 --> 11:26.400]  you know i'm all for this let's come together again i'm not for eugenics i
[11:26.400 --> 11:29.840]  don't want to see any race wiped out i think it's it's
[11:29.840 --> 11:34.400]  unbelievable the thought that i'm superior to somebody because the way i
[11:34.400 --> 11:38.480]  look my physical attributes
[11:38.480 --> 11:43.840]  i mean could you be more ignorant than that than to believe something like that
[11:43.840 --> 11:47.600]  but no she believes it that's the thing and no one no one is stepping up to the
[11:47.600 --> 11:50.480]  plate no one's asking the tough question the tougher question is the second
[11:50.480 --> 11:53.600]  amendment question folks and she is she's just going to get it look
[11:53.600 --> 11:57.280]  i'm going to take calls based on uh this eugenics comment
[11:57.280 --> 12:00.720]  and the eater robots that's pretty much what i want to stick to right now do a
[12:00.720 --> 12:02.720]  little bit of a news blitz and we'll take your calls
[12:02.720 --> 12:07.920]  uh at the 20 marker and the 20 after marker house panel passes health bills
[12:07.920 --> 12:12.320]  critics slam cost see this is going to cost us all sorts of money
[12:12.320 --> 12:18.480]  again as the economy crashes as there are less and less jobs as there are no
[12:18.480 --> 12:22.320]  more benefits as they begin to take your house away they are
[12:22.320 --> 12:28.480]  going to jack the cost up of health care they are going to jack the cost up
[12:28.480 --> 12:31.360]  of your home based on this climate bill they're going to come in and say you
[12:31.360 --> 12:34.480]  know what you're not electricity efficient this is going to be on your
[12:34.480 --> 12:36.960]  dime you have such and such a time period to fix it if you don't you're
[12:36.960 --> 12:39.280]  going to be heavily taxed we're going to take your house away
[12:39.280 --> 12:42.800]  and then they're going to up the price of energy so that once you do make the
[12:42.800 --> 12:46.240]  changes you're still going to be paying three to four times more it's the open
[12:46.240 --> 12:50.080]  plan it's something we discuss on the show
[12:50.080 --> 12:54.480]  and they're saying over a trillion dollars over a trill
[12:54.480 --> 12:58.000]  but i mean it's not real money they just printed out of nowhere
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.960]  meanwhile they can now have home interventions no big deal
[13:00.960 --> 13:04.000]  home interventions for the swine flu and by the way uh this one's out of the
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.640]  guardian this is uk but i i try to keep a a global look
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.080]  on this uh swine flu thing because it's under the world
[13:12.080 --> 13:17.760]  health organization un control and we are at w h o level six we've been there
[13:17.760 --> 13:21.200]  officially now uh for over a month i believe
[13:21.200 --> 13:24.560]  over a month and they are taking the steps
[13:24.560 --> 13:28.080]  right now right now to say you're taking the shot and you don't have a choice
[13:28.080 --> 13:31.600]  remember in canada they're going to start with the schools just like here
[13:31.600 --> 13:35.360]  kathryn sableis is on record that's the head of health and human services for
[13:35.360 --> 13:39.520]  those that don't know just look into it they are going to make your kids school
[13:39.520 --> 13:43.040]  a mass vaccination center so they get the kiddies first then the parents
[13:43.040 --> 13:46.320]  have to come in and get their kids oh do you have your shot
[13:46.320 --> 13:50.080]  oh well you got to make an appointment too we need to keep tabs on you as well
[13:50.080 --> 13:53.680]  but in canada they've already figured out that the 18 to 30 crowd isn't going to
[13:53.680 --> 13:56.800]  go for because they're too busy drinking and having fun and not caring
[13:56.800 --> 13:59.680]  so what are they going to do they're going to go to where they're drinking and
[13:59.680 --> 14:02.880]  having fun and not caring that's right they're going to make make shift
[14:02.880 --> 14:08.720]  vaccination centers out of the bar that's right at a bar strip
[14:08.720 --> 14:12.720]  how dangerous is it to inject toxins into somebody's body
[14:12.720 --> 14:16.320]  while they're inebriated on alcohol and god knows what else
[14:16.320 --> 14:19.120]  but that's the loving government for you that's what they're going to do and
[14:19.120 --> 14:21.200]  then i guess the people that they can't get through all these different
[14:21.200 --> 14:24.560]  programs it's going to be the old knock hey
[14:24.560 --> 14:28.960]  did you take that three mandatory shot but meanwhile they have to
[14:28.960 --> 14:32.400]  fear monger that this is going to shut down schools this is going to shut down
[14:32.400 --> 14:36.080]  work this is going to hurt the economy swine blue may keep some schools shut
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.080]  in september uncertainty over your spread of pandemic
[14:40.080 --> 14:44.160]  could keep pupils away at start of autumn term
[14:44.160 --> 14:46.720]  some schools in england could remain closed in september if the swine
[14:46.720 --> 14:50.160]  flu pandemic escalates over the summer see it won't what will happen is
[14:50.160 --> 14:54.000]  they'll say man we just beat it and now the kids are coming in let's
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.760]  let's nip this swine flu thing in the bud
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.720]  before it gets cold and it comes flu season so again they have to fear monger
[15:02.720 --> 15:07.120]  right now but they're building the infrastructure
[15:07.120 --> 15:10.560]  where every kid is going to have to take this shot i'm warning parents out there
[15:10.560 --> 15:13.680]  i mean there's if there's one thing i tell people with kids
[15:13.680 --> 15:17.680]  and and i've been doing it in fact my landlord was over yesterday
[15:17.680 --> 15:20.480]  he was replacing my dryer he had his son with him
[15:20.480 --> 15:25.200]  and his grandson actually and i said look if there's one thing i can tell you
[15:25.200 --> 15:28.560]  it's don't take this swine flu shot don't you got a family man don't let
[15:28.560 --> 15:32.800]  your kids take it it's a bad bad idea what do you mean it's a bad idea i'm
[15:32.800 --> 15:37.920]  like well 1976 60 minutes in 79 had to do a story
[15:37.920 --> 15:42.240]  that in 76 when they injected people with the swine flu vaccinations and it
[15:42.240 --> 15:47.440]  caused mass paralysis and death i mean i'm not sure which i'd rather have i
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.520]  actually i am sure i'd probably rather die than be a quadriplegic
[15:51.520 --> 15:54.960]  that's no offense to quadriplegics out there i know we've got a ton listening
[15:54.960 --> 15:58.800]  i'm sure or people that'll be offended but i cannot imagine having to go
[15:58.800 --> 16:02.800]  through life without the use of my arms and legs
[16:02.800 --> 16:06.560]  because the elite run a eugenics program where they're poisoning the population
[16:06.560 --> 16:10.960]  and they made me take a shot that i obviously didn't need
[16:10.960 --> 16:13.920]  and then they hype up the amount of deaths from swine flu
[16:13.920 --> 16:17.440]  remember the remember the first couple deaths first of all it was piggy flu
[16:17.440 --> 16:20.800]  and it'd come from mexico but then they couldn't find me pigs within in mexico
[16:20.800 --> 16:24.000]  then the story came out weeks later after they said it was from mexico no
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.560]  well actually it was a pig in canada from a Mexican migrant worker
[16:28.560 --> 16:33.040]  no proof just a story zero proof meanwhile the first
[16:33.040 --> 16:36.080]  person that dies in the united states from swine flu and i haven't seen a
[16:36.080 --> 16:38.080]  pandemic i haven't seen people with masks on
[16:38.080 --> 16:42.320]  i haven't seen people getting extra sick and was a two-year-old boy
[16:42.320 --> 16:45.360]  who was from mexico wasn't even a u.s citizen
[16:45.360 --> 16:49.280]  had all these health problems beforehand had been in and out of hospitals his
[16:49.280 --> 16:53.120]  whole life and may have had this swine flu which is
[16:53.120 --> 16:56.240]  really three types of flu it is one part bird flu
[16:56.240 --> 16:59.920]  two parts swine flu one part human flu look it up
[16:59.920 --> 17:04.960]  regular that i mean that is open i mean i think that's even on wikipedia
[17:04.960 --> 17:08.560]  but by this time so many people are brainwashed this comes from pigs and
[17:08.560 --> 17:11.360]  they're gonna have to slaughter all sorts of animals because of it you tell
[17:11.360 --> 17:13.440]  them to the normal person they're like no man
[17:13.440 --> 17:17.360]  you see that all-star game obama can sure pitch a ball
[17:17.360 --> 17:21.440]  through that ball real good like my president
[17:21.440 --> 17:24.560]  all right let's uh let's jump to some other news mark cuban insider trading
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.480]  case thrown out this out of Reuters but we have a story over at info wars dot
[17:28.480 --> 17:32.400]  com right now that's right mark cuban had been threatened with insider trading
[17:32.400 --> 17:35.360]  in texas after one of these guys started
[17:35.360 --> 17:38.880]  threatening because he was thinking about funding the loose change project
[17:38.880 --> 17:42.000]  and uh they had a big email exchange and then they said you know we're going to
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.440]  do it anyway but now a u.s court judge threw out insider
[17:45.440 --> 17:48.240]  trading case against alice mavericks basketball team owner
[17:48.240 --> 17:51.440]  mark cuban on friday but gave the u.s securities and exchange commission a
[17:51.440 --> 17:56.400]  month to file an amended lawsuit cuban listed by force magazine is one of the
[17:56.400 --> 18:00.320]  400 richest americans face civil charges that he acted on non-public
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.000]  information when he sold his stake in internet search ended company
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.760]  mama dot com to avoid more than a seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar
[18:07.760 --> 18:12.800]  loss u.s district judge sydney uh fits water gave the sec 30 days to file an
[18:12.800 --> 18:16.560]  amended complaint if the sec can allege that cuban undertook a duty
[18:16.560 --> 18:20.560]  expressly or implicitly see this is for three quarters of a million dollars
[18:20.560 --> 18:24.240]  and this is a pretty honest guy this is a guy that does put out cutting-edge
[18:24.240 --> 18:27.120]  products uh you know magnolia pictures you know not
[18:27.120 --> 18:28.720]  everything they do is great but at least they're
[18:28.720 --> 18:32.640]  challenging the system and they're worried about three quarters of a
[18:32.640 --> 18:36.800]  million dollars we got people stealing trillions right now
[18:36.800 --> 18:41.120]  let me repeat that we got people stealing trillions trillions while you
[18:41.120 --> 18:45.040]  struggle to make your house payment while you're still paying over paying for
[18:45.040 --> 18:47.920]  gas even at what looks like 240 right now
[18:47.920 --> 18:52.080]  it shouldn't be 240 and you know i got a clip on that
[18:52.080 --> 18:54.720]  i don't know if it's gonna make the new obama film but we got a representative
[18:54.720 --> 18:56.960]  going there you know what is up with this
[18:56.960 --> 19:02.080]  like that the uh supply is up the demand is lower
[19:02.080 --> 19:05.280]  we should be uh paying a lot less what's going on here
[19:05.280 --> 19:09.920]  is this a little uh price gouging a little collusion i wonder
[19:09.920 --> 19:14.000]  these guys are still making handover fist in every aspect
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.280]  the wars are still happening in the middle east in fact we got a bombing in
[19:17.280 --> 19:19.760]  the middle east right now i'm sure it's going to be blamed on al-qaeda
[19:19.760 --> 19:24.720]  where al-qaeda like cells or terrorists or insurgents it's over in indonesia
[19:24.720 --> 19:29.040]  in fact i i'm i'm sure right right now on the news
[19:29.040 --> 19:33.120]  they're saying it's al-qaeda i i i just have a prediction right now we're
[19:33.120 --> 19:37.600]  taping uh c-span so i won't know for sure but i'm sure it's al-qaeda
[19:37.600 --> 19:41.920]  because bombs have ripped through indonesian hotels must be al-qaeda

[24:37.760 --> 24:41.520]  people and wounding dozens in an attack the president said would damage
[24:41.520 --> 24:44.640]  confidence in southeast asia's biggest economy
[24:44.640 --> 24:49.360]  suicide bombers struck the jw merit hotel and close by ritz carlton both
[24:49.360 --> 24:52.480]  popular popular with visiting international businessmen
[24:52.480 --> 24:56.240]  and boasting some of the tightest security in jacarta as guests sat down
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.560]  for a breakfast power meeting so to me it's going to be pretty interesting to
[25:00.560 --> 25:04.720]  see who was killed in this who was targeted and who they blame and again
[25:04.720 --> 25:07.680]  they blame al qaeda for everything so i don't think this is going to be much of
[25:07.680 --> 25:10.560]  an exception all right let's go to our first caller
[25:10.560 --> 25:17.680]  john in washington johnny on the air how you doing jason good listen i i got
[25:17.680 --> 25:22.880]  some information about those eater robots and it kind of
[25:22.880 --> 25:30.480]  surprised me actually um my wife is a um distributor for electronics components
[25:30.480 --> 25:34.080]  and when i told her about this story
[25:34.080 --> 25:37.760]  um after work the other day she goes
[25:37.760 --> 25:43.120]  oh that doesn't sound right and i said well what do you mean she goes well
[25:43.120 --> 25:48.400]  she knows mr finkelstein at rt i because apparently they've done business
[25:48.400 --> 25:52.480]  through her company before so she calls him
[25:52.480 --> 25:56.480]  and um he was quite candid about it and and
[25:56.480 --> 26:01.760]  what it comes down to is that um and any electronics and these r&d projects they
[26:01.760 --> 26:05.920]  have what they call software then they have firmware
[26:05.920 --> 26:09.200]  then they have hardware and then they have what's called
[26:09.200 --> 26:14.880]  vaporware vaporware are wishful ideas ideas about things that they
[26:14.880 --> 26:18.480]  wish they could do or want to do some time
[26:18.480 --> 26:23.680]  he said or he told my wife that there are no eater robots
[26:23.680 --> 26:27.920]  that are operative there are none under construction
[26:27.920 --> 26:32.640]  there are no contracts for them and at this point it's vaporware
[26:32.640 --> 26:36.080]  so what this implies to me because this came out
[26:36.080 --> 26:40.000]  in the media was you know carried and has been talked about on the internet and
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.320]  so forth created a buzz it's one of those stories that
[26:44.320 --> 26:49.600]  they like to feed out to the public so they can draw people's attention away
[26:49.600 --> 26:54.000]  kind of hype people up perhaps make some people a little fearful
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.040]  of the government or how they're doing this this technology isn't that off the
[26:59.040 --> 27:01.600]  realm it's kind of all almost a beta test i mean
[27:01.600 --> 27:05.440]  again we just found out two weeks ago the nazis had the stealth bomber
[27:05.440 --> 27:08.480]  i mean think about how long that's why i can't stand it when people always tell
[27:08.480 --> 27:12.000]  me oh they could never lie about something for so long
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.520]  we just waited uh 60 plus years to find out that the nazis
[27:15.520 --> 27:18.800]  had the stealth bomber they had the technology i mean what was the official
[27:18.800 --> 27:21.920]  story before that that we we developed in the 70s through
[27:21.920 --> 27:25.680]  skunkworks and then we had it uh in the late 70s with the
[27:25.680 --> 27:30.560]  with our model i mean come on so to me this may be quote unquote vaporware or
[27:30.560 --> 27:33.200]  only be modeled in a computer or maybe they've only made
[27:33.200 --> 27:36.640]  uh one or two models but it's scary to me because i have seen
[27:36.640 --> 27:40.160]  the actual live models the things that are on the battlefield right now
[27:40.160 --> 27:43.440]  such as the big dog you know we should bring a video up with a big dog
[27:43.440 --> 27:48.080]  of the robo snake of the robo fish that's not military yet but they're using
[27:48.080 --> 27:51.760]  in the uk to surveil the waters a lot of this stuff has ai technology
[27:51.760 --> 27:55.920]  there's a company out there called festo that has the robo penguin that looks
[27:55.920 --> 27:58.400]  just totally creepy swims amongst the penguins
[27:58.400 --> 28:01.520]  and then they also have a stingray so we're going to pull some of those videos
[28:01.520 --> 28:03.920]  we're going to play on the other side i appreciate the call john we're going to

[28:12.080 --> 28:15.280]  hey oh thanks uh uh those are robotic things i'd
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.680]  think that's not uh vaporware i mean like you said they got the fish they
[28:19.680 --> 28:23.360]  got the the israel snake they got uh
[28:23.360 --> 28:27.200]  they got a you know it's ai gps man that's what it's for
[28:27.200 --> 28:30.320]  and they just announced too that they were going to be using small hummingbird
[28:30.320 --> 28:33.360]  like insects that would be remote controlled by people
[28:33.360 --> 28:36.720]  uh there was some suspicion that they were spying on protesters uh a little
[28:36.720 --> 28:40.160]  over a year ago in dc with these things but now they're just
[28:40.160 --> 28:44.880]  openly saying yeah we got them yeah well people can do their own research and
[28:44.880 --> 28:48.400]  find out that hitler had the uh honobo too
[28:48.400 --> 28:51.280]  they can look that up on the internet if they like google that but in that
[28:51.280 --> 28:54.880]  article it said uh they would gobble up whatever organic material they could

[29:12.800 --> 29:16.880]  at the xm-25 look at this new weapon that the military is going to be
[29:16.880 --> 29:21.040]  wielding it has a smart chip in a bullet that allows the bullet to
[29:21.040 --> 29:24.800]  curve around to get the target go around buildings go through buildings
[29:24.800 --> 29:28.640]  and then explode like a grenade within three feet of its target and kill
[29:28.640 --> 29:31.360]  everybody you know this is a smart bullet and it has heat
[29:31.360 --> 29:35.520]  sensors it's something that out of a a science fiction movie but it's fact now

[34:25.360 --> 34:31.120]  home gain dot com that's h o m e g a i n dot com
[34:31.120 --> 34:35.040]  all right let's uh let's go back to callers and uh while i'm doing this i
[34:35.040 --> 34:38.160]  want to show you some of these robots i've been talking about over at prism
[34:38.160 --> 34:41.520]  planet dot tv let's bring up uh who do we have let's let's show them the big
[34:41.520 --> 34:45.280]  dog you know because now we have the big dog we have the ripsaw
[34:45.280 --> 34:50.480]  the ripsaw is a tent essentially a tank with a 25 or 50 caliber mounted on top
[34:50.480 --> 34:53.680]  of it and it is a weapon now the big dog is there to
[34:53.680 --> 34:56.400]  carry weapons and whatnot but it's very hard to
[34:56.400 --> 35:00.000]  disable basically because it it kind of goes side to side you can kick it you
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.600]  can bounce it and if you put a weapon on this thing
[35:03.600 --> 35:06.640]  can you imagine how scary this thing looks they call the big dog because it
[35:06.640 --> 35:10.640]  kind of looks like a dog without a face but here it is going through
[35:10.640 --> 35:15.120]  you know pretty rough terrain with a probably at say a hundred or so pounds
[35:15.120 --> 35:18.080]  mounted on top of it all this different equipment
[35:18.080 --> 35:21.920]  all right let's go to uh dan in north carolina dan you're in line
[35:21.920 --> 35:29.440]  all right hey jason um yeah i know i um i saw big dog quite a while ago and that
[35:29.440 --> 35:32.960]  that's really what's kind of scary more than anything else because you look at
[35:32.960 --> 35:36.720]  it and you think about like the process or power they have to have in that thing
[35:36.720 --> 35:40.640]  for it to correct correct its uh its movement you know when it's caked and
[35:40.640 --> 35:43.600]  stuff and they talked about um i was looking on
[35:43.600 --> 35:47.280]  in articles and stuff and they're talking about uh putting technology on it
[35:47.280 --> 35:51.920]  that would be able to track like human heartbeat and human breath and stuff
[35:51.920 --> 35:56.480]  so they're talking about essentially an extremely mobile weapons platform that
[35:56.480 --> 35:59.280]  can track people and that just freaks me out
[35:59.280 --> 36:02.640]  more than anything well we live in a track and trace society and right now
[36:02.640 --> 36:06.480]  they're uh they're showing um that that's kind of virtual video
[36:06.480 --> 36:09.520]  of these robo penguins but before they were showing the robo penguins
[36:09.520 --> 36:13.920]  actually in the water with other penguins and that's just a side we live in i
[36:13.920 --> 36:18.640]  mean we we now have the census bureau going from house to house and gps in
[36:18.640 --> 36:23.280]  every single home i just saw the latest version of google earth and oh my god
[36:23.280 --> 36:27.600]  it is just off the charts i mean how much longer until all of our houses
[36:27.600 --> 36:32.640]  our 3d model where you can get like a real time zoom in and this is something
[36:32.640 --> 36:36.800]  that not you know intelligence agencies don't have the public has this so we're
[36:36.800 --> 36:40.000]  really living in a society where we can almost track trace and surveil
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.920]  each other if we so desire so you know that the government's doing it you know
[36:43.920 --> 36:47.360]  it through the at&t versus heptin case that was thrown out
[36:47.360 --> 36:51.120]  in the beginning of june you know where they actually had to admit let me say
[36:51.120 --> 36:54.560]  again they actually had to admit that they were tracking and tracing
[36:54.560 --> 36:58.400]  everything you do on your internet and cell phone with a standard line
[36:58.400 --> 37:01.040]  that would take all that information and store it on a hard drive where they
[37:01.040 --> 37:04.400]  would then run it through like promise or carnivore all
[37:04.400 --> 37:07.440]  these software where it would be automated before it saw even human eyes
[37:07.440 --> 37:11.280]  so i mean we are well beyond the pale of what 1984
[37:11.280 --> 37:15.040]  wanted to be because we are in a technological super state
[37:15.040 --> 37:20.400]  that is just far beyond the visions of you know or well or you know brave new
[37:20.400 --> 37:23.600]  world and it's it's i mean some of the things aren't there yet but they will
[37:23.600 --> 37:26.400]  be i thank you for the call just a moment ago
[37:26.400 --> 37:29.920]  they were showing this einstein robot and i forgot what headline i read but the
[37:29.920 --> 37:32.560]  last time i sat in for the alex joneshow a couple weeks ago
[37:32.560 --> 37:35.600]  we read a headline about that thing i thought i think it taught itself to do
[37:35.600 --> 37:39.200]  something so not only are these robotics in that einstein one looks really
[37:39.200 --> 37:42.560]  creepy i told them to bring up handsome robotics and if there's a little panel
[37:42.560 --> 37:46.320]  on the side that says robots where they're trying to rebuild philip k dick
[37:46.320 --> 37:49.360]  uh... they got a robot called joey chaos all these different
[37:49.360 --> 37:54.560]  robotics it is terminator s let me say again it is terminator s but
[37:54.560 --> 37:57.840]  instead of the robots being in charge the elite will be in charge
[37:57.840 --> 38:01.040]  see they're never really going to be fully automated hopefully i mean that
[38:01.040 --> 38:05.520]  that would be nightmare amongst itself harry in michigan harry you're online
[38:05.520 --> 38:09.520]  yes sir uh... jason yes
[38:09.520 --> 38:14.240]  there are good talk to you yeah i'm a long time listener and uh...
[38:14.240 --> 38:18.480]  way before alex started to show how i was aware of all this and i'm
[38:18.480 --> 38:24.000]  62 years old and not and i think the world is in deep trouble and um
[38:24.000 --> 38:29.840]  harder i try to uh... ask the word to see if i could further back i'd go
[38:29.840 --> 38:33.360]  and uh... i'm still trying to convince people of uh... chemtrails
[38:33.360 --> 38:37.760]  alone that was a fairy in connection with running this world
[38:37.760 --> 38:44.240]  and uh... there's a
[38:44.240 --> 38:48.400]  like the people nowadays were living off the bottom portion of our brain and
[38:48.400 --> 38:50.960]  uh... the lizard we know the lizard people
[38:50.960 --> 38:55.280]  and uh... we're in some deep trouble and uh... well sir i gotta agree with you
[38:55.280 --> 38:58.480]  we are in some deep trouble but it's really because society chooses to be
[38:58.480 --> 39:01.200]  and i thank you for the call i mean we choose
[39:01.200 --> 39:05.040]  to care about our jenny like we choose to care about our sports
[39:05.040 --> 39:08.400]  more than knowing what our government's up to we choose just to watch
[39:08.400 --> 39:11.920]  the nightly news or a 24-hour news network instead of actually becoming
[39:11.920 --> 39:16.080]  active in our communities uh... not going to our city council meetings
[39:16.080 --> 39:19.040]  not taking part in the political process
[39:19.040 --> 39:22.480]  well i mean we dig our own graves you know when ron paul says we get the
[39:22.480 --> 39:25.680]  government we deserve unfortunately that is the case i i think that sometimes
[39:25.680 --> 39:30.080]  they go way over the top and it really is a reflection of the
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.440]  corrupted moral society we live in you the people are still good
[39:33.440 --> 39:36.560]  okay i i don't want to get totally self-righteous and out of line
[39:36.560 --> 39:39.520]  there is a lot of goodness in people a lot of people are out there you know to
[39:39.520 --> 39:42.320]  take care of their families and there's a lot of love in their hearts and they
[39:42.320 --> 39:45.360]  just don't know the bigger picture a lot of its tact if you're trying to wake
[39:45.360 --> 39:48.560]  people up you know you have to i mean you just were
[39:48.560 --> 39:51.520]  all of you went from chemtrails to luciferianism
[39:51.520 --> 39:54.480]  you know a lot of you know people are going to respond to that if you want
[39:54.480 --> 39:57.840]  people to respond to your message and you can't get them to talk about chem
[39:57.840 --> 40:01.920]  trails we'll just say take them outside well what is that oh that's a con trail
[40:01.920 --> 40:05.520]  really that's a con trail and then you explain geoengineering
[40:05.520 --> 40:08.640]  you have to have a laptop next to you this is the information age this is
[40:08.640 --> 40:10.960]  where everything is at the cusp of your fingertips
[40:10.960 --> 40:15.440]  and really your brain not just your imagination but your recall
[40:15.440 --> 40:18.640]  remember we used to have recall we used to teach memory in school
[40:18.640 --> 40:22.080]  it's a very novel idea to try to remember things you're taught
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.520]  instead we live in this you know information age where your attention
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.600]  span is less than 15 minutes and your retention of information is in an
[40:29.600 --> 40:33.360]  all-time low and we do it to ourselves by slurping down
[40:33.360 --> 40:38.400]  you know mercury filled corn syrup laced coca-colas all day
[40:38.400 --> 40:42.720]  forget about the alcohol forget about just the slothfulness of society
[40:42.720 --> 40:45.920]  and not everybody i know there's a lot of good smart people out there that are
[40:45.920 --> 40:49.280]  struggling that are working three jobs try to support a family three forget
[40:49.280 --> 40:53.120]  about two now it's like three three to support a family
[40:53.120 --> 40:56.640]  their wife works they can still barely afford the payments they just don't have
[40:56.640 --> 41:00.000]  time for this stuff but again those people are the ones
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.960]  that are zombified by the nightly news by their favorite talk radio guy
[41:04.960 --> 41:08.800]  and you have to find points of agreement with them first and then expand on
[41:08.800 --> 41:11.840]  those points of agreement to try to bring them beyond the false left right
[41:11.840 --> 41:14.720]  paradigm that's what i found works the best
[41:14.720 --> 41:18.880]  all right let's go to josh in florida josh online
[41:18.880 --> 41:23.680]  yes sir how you doing good oh yeah i had a question about uh well not a question
[41:23.680 --> 41:28.400]  i had some comments about a eugenics i know alex was uh asking a few days ago
[41:28.400 --> 41:32.640]  for solutions like what he should do if you should start an organization
[41:32.640 --> 41:36.320]  but uh in front of me i have the uh city of tamarack that's from
[41:36.320 --> 41:41.440]  broward county south florida at the two two thousand seven water quality report
[41:41.440 --> 41:45.520]  and then uh in this packet you open it up and
[41:45.520 --> 41:51.920]  it tells you okay they put fluoride in it at 0.722 parts per million
[41:51.920 --> 41:55.680]  and then we also have uh all these things that are not available
[41:55.680 --> 42:02.960]  chloromethane which is a refrigerant um they also put acetone in it which is a
[42:02.960 --> 42:07.680]  nail polish remover uh they also have two uh butanine
[42:07.680 --> 42:13.520]  which is uh used in plastics plastics uh they also have chloroform
[42:13.520 --> 42:18.240]  uh and that's used in teflon and it's also says uh
[42:18.240 --> 42:22.560]  dichrobromethane which is on the water supply
[42:22.560 --> 42:26.880]  yeah and i have it right here the water quality report 2007 and
[42:26.880 --> 42:31.120]  they have sodium fluoride barium and then all those things i just listed
[42:31.120 --> 42:34.960]  and you just do a quick you know google search looking on wikipedia
[42:34.960 --> 42:39.760]  and you find out that all these things are in plastics um nail polish remover
[42:39.760 --> 42:44.000]  and it's pretty crazy i actually have all i think it's crazy and then you know
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.880]  what the public doesn't even care and beyond just drinking it i mean you
[42:46.880 --> 42:49.840]  absorb that through your skin when you're taking a shower in your daily
[42:49.840 --> 42:53.520]  dose of yeah you you breathe it in i need you to write an article or send it
[42:53.520 --> 42:57.760]  to writers at info wars dot com articles and info wars dot com a scan of this
[42:57.760 --> 43:00.560]  information hopefully have a scanner and you can get it out there
[43:00.560 --> 43:04.080]  because we need to do a story about this i mean this eugenics program hits us
[43:04.080 --> 43:07.600]  from so many angles it's not just the water it's not just the food it's not
[43:07.600 --> 43:11.920]  just the shots i mean now it's the air you breathe as well and that's what you
[43:11.920 --> 43:14.880]  know that's what you have to explain to people while you're talking about
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.960]  chemtrails you know again don't don't go off into other tangents i thank you for
[43:18.960 --> 43:22.400]  the call josh great caller uh hopefully we can post that over there because
[43:22.400 --> 43:25.680]  people aren't aware barium in your water did you just hear the guy
[43:25.680 --> 43:31.920]  very um chloroform i mean people know from movies because people relate to
[43:31.920 --> 43:36.080]  movies so well because movies are people's lives but chloroform
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.000]  is bad bad bad it will knock you out
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.120]  but let's go to movies again because i know people relate to the movies they
[43:43.120 --> 43:46.640]  love the hollywood pictures but when you when somebody's being abducted or
[43:46.640 --> 43:50.480]  attacked what do they always do they take a rag with chloroform in it
[43:50.480 --> 43:54.240]  you're not supposed to drink it it's not good for your body it's not good for
[43:54.240 --> 43:57.120]  your kids you're not supposed to absorb it through your skin and wash
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.400]  yourself with chloroform i don't radical ideas coming out of
[44:02.400 --> 44:07.440]  this program all right let's go to david in north carolina david online
[44:07.440 --> 44:10.320]  northern california brother it's good to talk to you again
[44:10.320 --> 44:15.120]  thank you two things uh one i want to take this opportunity to applaud that
[44:15.120 --> 44:18.960]  uh congressman that stood up and talked about eugenics on the floor of the
[44:18.960 --> 44:22.000]  house thank you sir what was his name again
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.160]  his name is joseph pits and i think that we're going to play that clip
[44:26.160 --> 44:29.280]  uh on the other side of the next uh segment we're going to definitely play
[44:29.280 --> 44:32.400]  that again because it's only a minute and 27 seconds and it really does
[44:32.400 --> 44:35.760]  deserve a uh uh standing applause really
[44:35.760 --> 44:39.760]  yeah well here it is
[44:41.600 --> 44:45.440]  all right i didn't stand up all right so on the eater i have the pdf here in
[44:45.440 --> 44:48.560]  front of me and i scan i i look at it really close
[44:48.560 --> 44:52.000]  in the pdf itself it doesn't say anything about using bodies
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.840]  uh okay so i'm not sure where that came from but uh let me give you a couple of
[44:55.840 --> 44:59.680]  highlights from it it's kind of interesting the rationale and utility
[44:59.680 --> 45:04.160]  part what's going to be used for the inherent advantage is its ability to
[45:04.160 --> 45:09.040]  engage in long endurance tedious and hazardous tasks such as reconnaissance
[45:09.040 --> 45:12.960]  surveillance and target acquisition without fatigue or stress basically this
[45:12.960 --> 45:17.600]  these things can stay out there forever eating stuff and and cruising around
[45:17.600 --> 45:21.280]  and uh scanning down to the bottom here they talk about the number of
[45:21.280 --> 45:26.640]  applications uh commercialization of the eater is focused on
[45:26.640 --> 45:30.960]  developing a prototype for military applications that's number one
[45:30.960 --> 45:34.960]  and civil applications including homeland security
[45:34.960 --> 45:39.680]  evolving uh autonomous intelligent control which basically means you can do
[45:39.680 --> 45:43.840]  everything you know in a primitive way it can think the way humans can do
[45:43.840 --> 45:47.920]  think and make decisions and to provide unmanned
[45:47.920 --> 45:52.720]  ground water uh robotic swarms and cognitive
[45:52.720 --> 45:57.680]  collectives driverless cars distributed intelligence
[45:57.680 --> 46:02.080]  ubiquitous intelligence and intelligent infrastructure
[46:02.080 --> 46:07.360]  control of complex systems of systems and decision making for decision makers
[46:07.360 --> 46:10.240]  in other words it basically is the swarm of these things
[46:10.240 --> 46:15.360]  uh you know all interrelated uh yeah like a hive mind concept where you know
[46:15.360 --> 46:19.040]  they they've got one target and they work in unity kind of like a you know a
[46:19.040 --> 46:23.680]  beehive i mean or or hands working together yep and and basically taking
[46:23.680 --> 46:28.080]  over large chunks of of terrain and and just staying there
[46:28.080 --> 46:30.960]  so anyway i'm not sure on the body thing but uh
[46:30.960 --> 46:36.320]  i think that our biomass is they're just assuming i i have to check the pdf
[46:36.320 --> 46:40.880]  uh file i'm myself out but i i do wonder you know what are these things gonna do
[46:40.880 --> 46:44.480]  reject a mouse that's in the field are they going to reject
[46:44.480 --> 46:47.680]  you know a dead bird or are they actually going to absorb it i mean is it
[46:47.680 --> 46:51.200]  possible that they could build these things large enough to consume human
[46:51.200 --> 46:53.760]  bodies i mean i think that is a possibility
[46:53.760 --> 46:56.640]  and uh you know it is odd to me the way that they
[46:56.640 --> 47:01.440]  immediately changed it but uh again it's it's a spooky scenario whether it's
[47:01.440 --> 47:03.920]  eating human beings or not i thank you for the call
[47:03.920 --> 47:08.400]  let's go to k in ohio k you're online
[47:08.400 --> 47:15.200]  yes k yes uh good afternoon by the way this is a totally different subject than
[47:15.200 --> 47:18.320]  what you've been discussing but i'm hoping maybe you can give me just a
[47:18.320 --> 47:22.160]  little bit of advice i'm a grandmother of three little
[47:22.160 --> 47:27.760]  girls ages four six and seven and they are a victim of
[47:27.760 --> 47:31.120]  children's services here in johnson county ohio
[47:31.120 --> 47:35.440]  we have corrupt and unethical judge we have attorneys that
[47:35.440 --> 47:40.560]  deal behind closed doors and these kids are in foster care with nothing ever
[47:40.560 --> 47:44.080]  proven legally is what it should have even been taken
[47:44.080 --> 47:50.080]  but now after 15 months they're putting them up for adoption
[47:50.080 --> 47:54.000]  well that is a tragic story and ma'am i i wish i had some advice for you other
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.960]  than to fight these people tooth and nail it's something maybe you could take up
[47:56.960 --> 48:00.560]  with alex when he returns on monday but i really don't know what to tell you i
[48:00.560 --> 48:03.360]  don't know the specifics of the case and i really just can't go into him on the
[48:03.360 --> 48:06.560]  show today i thank you for the call all right i'm going to do a little bit of a
[48:06.560 --> 48:08.800]  news blitz and then on the other side
[48:08.800 --> 48:12.480]  we're going to play that clip again of the representative out of pennsylvania
[48:12.480 --> 48:16.480]  joseph pits talking about the eugenics program and john
[48:16.480 --> 48:22.160]  judge ginsberg's support of such a program i mean this guy again it was it
[48:22.160 --> 48:25.920]  was a beautiful moment on the house floor
[48:25.920 --> 48:30.880]  moon landing tapes got erased nasa admits now i want people to understand
[48:30.880 --> 48:35.600]  just how ludicrous this story is now uh in the news all over yesterday oh it's
[48:35.600 --> 48:39.120]  coming up on the 40th anniversary of the moon landings and
[48:39.120 --> 48:42.400]  it's it's really happening oh the moon landings we
[48:42.400 --> 48:46.640]  we're going to redo the footage look at how great that footage looks
[48:46.640 --> 48:53.120]  now nasa is coming out and saying oh we erased the moon landing tapes i mean
[48:53.120 --> 48:59.360]  it's comical the man walks on the moon for the first time and the agency
[48:59.360 --> 49:03.120]  responsible for the tapes erases them yeah that's plausible
[49:03.120 --> 49:06.320]  see they took the original what they broadcast on television and they cleaned
[49:06.320 --> 49:09.360]  that up because they claimed they didn't have come on
[49:09.360 --> 49:17.840]  please i i you would have to be i mean the dumbest person in the entire world
[49:17.840 --> 49:22.080]  to erase the moon landing tapes i'm not even going to take it any farther folks
[49:22.080 --> 49:26.400]  but if you believe that i i have several bridges
[49:26.400 --> 49:30.160]  across the united states to sell you at an unbelievable price
[49:30.160 --> 49:34.640]  if you believe that nasa erased the moon landing tapes
[49:34.640 --> 49:41.760]  i mean come on give me a break give i i mean it's almost
[49:41.760 --> 49:48.080]  too far beyond the pale obama has tough love message for african americans now
[49:48.080 --> 49:50.960]  remember you're seeing all these different city year commercials the
[49:50.960 --> 49:54.400]  majority of which are reaching out to youthful minorities there are a
[49:54.400 --> 49:57.680]  couple where they are trying to get the white youth to join as well
[49:57.680 --> 50:00.960]  but i mean you literally you never hear a white guy going this will be great for
[50:00.960 --> 50:04.880]  caucasians to join however they do have a young african americans
[50:04.880 --> 50:08.720]  guy saying you know if you're a person of color you need to join city year

[50:12.080 --> 50:15.600]  i'm fierce people doing jumping jack so that's a good idea
[50:15.600 --> 50:18.960]  youth cores have always been a good idea so here he's telling we're gonna have to
[50:18.960 --> 50:22.080]  work and you know uh nobody's getting the past city
[50:22.080 --> 50:25.520]  years a good place to go president brock obama had a tough love message for
[50:25.520 --> 50:28.880]  fellow african americans on thursday urging black parents to push their
[50:28.880 --> 50:31.600]  children to think beyond dreams of being sport stars
[50:31.600 --> 50:35.440]  or rap music performers hey i got news for you obama

[55:10.720 --> 55:14.400]  again of representative joseph pits on the house floor
[55:14.400 --> 55:18.000]  out of pennsylvania talking about the eugenics program that the elite carry
[55:18.000 --> 55:23.120]  out daily
[55:23.120 --> 55:26.080]  thank you for what purpose as a gentleman from pennsylvania
[55:26.080 --> 55:30.240]  recognize mr speaker last week's new york times magazine featured an
[55:30.240 --> 55:33.760]  interview with supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.680]  some of her comments were absolutely astonishing coming from a sitting supreme
[55:37.680 --> 55:40.800]  court justice but the most disturbing comment came in
[55:40.800 --> 55:44.960]  reference to abortion in reference to roe v wade the infamous
[55:44.960 --> 55:49.680]  supreme court case she said this quote frankly i had thought that at the time
[55:49.680 --> 55:53.680]  roe was decided there was concern about population growth
[55:53.680 --> 55:57.440]  and particularly growth in populations that we don't want
[55:57.440 --> 56:03.200]  to have too many of in quote i cannot imagine any acceptable context and
[56:03.200 --> 56:07.520]  what a serious person could refer to populations that we don't want too many
[56:07.520 --> 56:12.160]  of this eugenic way of thinking debases the value of all human life
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.160]  all people people are created equal and deserve the most fundamental right to
[56:16.160 --> 56:19.920]  life no matter what race religion or socio-economic background
[56:19.920 --> 56:22.400]  i am shocked that a member of the supreme court
[56:22.400 --> 56:26.080]  believes that a compelling reason for the legality of abortion
[56:26.080 --> 56:30.960]  is because our society wants to reduce the growth of specific populations
[56:30.960 --> 56:35.760]  justice ginsburg's comments are an assault and insult to the values of the
[56:35.760 --> 56:39.680]  american people are you back all right there he is again just an amazing
[56:39.680 --> 56:42.560]  speech on the house floor and bravo mr pits
[56:42.560 --> 56:46.320]  all right let's go to steve in pennsylvania steve online
[56:46.320 --> 56:50.160]  um i just first off want to thank congressman pit
[56:50.160 --> 56:54.400]  for you know supporting our rights and
[56:54.400 --> 57:00.800]  um i wanted to make a point um regarding
[57:00.800 --> 57:05.600]  uh common misconception about robotics okay um
[57:05.600 --> 57:10.560]  i actually study robotics and one of the things we
[57:10.560 --> 57:13.760]  not we like i'm some kind of part of an organization
[57:13.760 --> 57:17.760]  i wanted things they strive for is um being autonomous
[57:17.760 --> 57:23.920]  um and that is self-sufficiency and that's you see that with these
[57:23.920 --> 57:29.520]  um man eater robots um they want to create robots that can tell where they
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.120]  are and gain the necessary energy to do a task
[57:35.120 --> 57:40.080]  that is the forefront of everything we're trying to do
[57:40.080 --> 57:43.200]  and uh
[57:45.920 --> 57:51.120]  it's important not to underestimate the intelligence level of the people
[57:51.120 --> 57:57.680]  uh behind um this field look the way i'm looking at it man is that public
[57:57.680 --> 58:01.760]  technology is at least 20 or 30 years behind what they have in closed
[58:01.760 --> 58:05.680]  doors and underground facilities in these lockheed martin and darpa
[58:05.680 --> 58:09.280]  institutes let's be honest again if if the nazis had the
[58:09.280 --> 58:13.520]  stealth bomber and it took almost 70 years to make that public
[58:13.520 --> 58:17.120]  knowledge what else are they hiding from us if they're rolling out
[58:17.120 --> 58:21.680]  glowing the dark pigs and dogs what else have they done
[58:21.680 --> 58:26.080]  with bioengineering behind closed doors i mean obviously something else is
[58:26.080 --> 58:29.600]  going on and yes there are some very intelligent people out there i mean how
[58:29.600 --> 58:31.760]  far was it 20 years ago it's the alex joneshow

[58:57.040 --> 59:00.400]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[59:00.400 --> 59:04.640]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[59:04.640 --> 59:07.760]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[59:07.760 --> 59:10.720]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[59:10.720 --> 59:14.400]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:14.400 --> 59:17.280]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[59:17.280 --> 59:20.800]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[59:20.800 --> 59:23.920]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[59:23.920 --> 59:27.120]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:27.120 --> 59:30.960]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar

[59:55.680 --> 1:00:05.040]  alex jones on the gcm radio network
[1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:09.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:17.120]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:23.920]  and now live from austin texas alex jones all right folks we are live i am just
[1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:27.600]  focusing in for alex jones
[1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:31.520]  obama has tough love message for african america now
[1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:35.040]  again when you read this it's it's kind of insulting to me
[1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:38.960]  because this isn't just again being a sports hero or a rap star
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:42.720]  isn't exclusive to the quote-unquote african american community
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:46.400]  it is all over it's pop culture baby i mean if you go down in
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:50.240]  mississippi is it any worse for a white kid to have the same dream
[1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:53.200]  of being an athletic star or maybe instead of a rapper
[1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:57.360]  a country star and believe me there are kids in mississippi listening to the
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:00:59.760]  rap it's all over the place it's it's an old
[1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:02.800]  form of music now it's been around almost 30 years
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:07.040]  it's at its crescendo in pop culture so a lot of this stuff is just
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:10.880]  totally mindless and totally insulting in my opinion
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:14.720]  we need a new mindset as as though he's part
[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:18.800]  of the african american community folks he's half white
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:22.640]  his father had tons of money tons of women he was a polygamist
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:26.000]  okay he had several wives all over he traveled the world
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:30.720]  he's an internationalist he doesn't know what being a poor african american
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:34.160]  is he never knew that oh i know he was taken care of his
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:38.240]  by his grandmother he has such a hard luck story he smoked meth
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:42.080]  oh president obama we can relate to you on so many levels
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:45.280]  we need a new mindset a new set of attitudes
[1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:48.640]  because one of the most durable and destructive legacies of discrimination
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:52.880]  is the way that we have internalized a sense of limitation
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:58.320]  what we have internalized a sense of limitation based on discrimination i
[1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:02.000]  think that that's totally just condescending
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.320]  how so many in our community have come to expect so little of ourselves
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:10.000]  sir that's beyond the african american community unfortunately
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.400]  unfortunately the world not even the world you know there are some go getters
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:16.640]  out there you see people in third world and second
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:20.640]  world nations really working you know 16 18 hours a day to try to
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:24.240]  get somewhere in life to try to take care of their family here there's a sense of
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:26.960]  entitlement it's not just black people there's
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:30.560]  plenty of white people who are lazy out there that have a sense of entitlement
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:33.280]  and we like that see that's what he doesn't tell you
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:37.040]  the social engineers his bosses actually like you
[1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:41.840]  to be dependent on social service uh dependent on the federal government
[1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:45.520]  dependent on these programs but see now he's setting you up
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:49.280]  to get into a new kind of program a community program
[1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:52.720]  city year or some other americorps type job
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:56.240]  obama had a packed ballroom at a manhattan hotel that blacks need to
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:58.560]  recapture the spirit of civil rights movement
[1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:02.720]  of a half century ago to tackle problems and have struck african americans
[1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:06.480]  disproportionately joblessness spiraling health care costs
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:09.920]  and hiv aids well maybe you shouldn't develop bio weapons
[1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:15.360]  that are a specific then huh i'm not that you did it you're your handlers
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:20.240]  your bosses did it but oh obama give me a break
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:25.360]  with this garbage this is garbajo the real civil rights movement
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:30.640]  is the patriot movement is the 911 truth movement
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:34.960]  we are the ones that want civil rights for all human beings
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:39.520]  we don't like being discriminated against because we make 30 000 a year
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:45.200]  or we make 15 000 a year or we don't live in a nice house
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:48.400]  we don't like being discriminated against because we're the little guy
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:51.280]  it doesn't have anything to do with the color of your skin get it through your
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:55.600]  heads people this is a war not only on the poor
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:03:59.040]  but the middle class and the upper middle class all you yuppies out there
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:01.680]  guess what they're in a place at the table for you either
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:04.880]  maybe one out of ten of you will work in some kind of like slave
[1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:08.880]  ceo office or you know be a real important person
[1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:13.200]  uh i'm sorry important person over at the uh the fema camps
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:16.640]  maybe maybe maybe you will be able to take care of your uh
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:20.240]  family on the slave grid a few of you but believe me your standard living is
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:23.440]  going down with the rest of us that survived this mess
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:27.920]  so again the real civil rights movement is the patriot movement
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:31.440]  are the people that want more liberty more freedom they want the constitution
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:35.040]  and bill of rights they want less government they want accountability
[1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:39.520]  they don't want massive bailouts that's a no-no
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:42.720]  they don't want bankruptcies and bailouts of industries that are just
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:46.240]  going to be put into this grid this north american union grid
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:50.400]  like christler we don't want that we don't want health bills and
[1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:53.600]  climate change bills that are only going to tax and enslave us we're against
[1:04:53.600 --> 1:04:56.560]  that too that's the real movement we'll be back after this is the alex jones

[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:26.960]  that scares the hell out of me oh you're talking about the eugenics book
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:31.600]  right where he's basically talking about geoengineering and population
[1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:35.920]  control and sustainability they love sustainability yeah
[1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:40.000]  and uh... you know this guy is i mean they put out a press release because of
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.320]  the because we have a large audience and when we expose somebody like this
[1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:47.920]  there's a new press release out there that obama's science are and personally
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:52.400]  i'm just disturbed at the uh... at the perception that we're using the term
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:57.360]  czar all over the place now our science czar does not support coercive
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:00.960]  population control spokesman says uh... however
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:04.720]  uh... who was it one of one of the obama's other administrators is a
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:08.320]  a member of the world sustainable society and calls for global governance
[1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:12.080]  gordon brown is another net member of this it really seems like he's stacking
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:16.080]  up his administration for people who are pro population control i mean you look
[1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:20.080]  at kathryn savelas and she's one of these people that's been to bill derbergh
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:24.400]  the last couple of years a total minion of the elites
[1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:28.640]  this um attacking around stuff i'm seeing stuff in the news that
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:31.680]  they're gonna do it that scares the hell out of me because that with the carbon
[1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:35.840]  tax is really really gonna just kill the economy
[1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:38.560]  well you know i don't know if they're gonna be i don't know if they're gonna
[1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:41.680]  be able to have a hot hard war and i ran without
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:45.440]  some kind of a provocateur western eyes
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:49.200]  false flag event i really just don't see the support for it in this country i mean
[1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:52.400]  people have really curled back now that obama's here on the fact that we need to
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:56.400]  get out of a afghanistan iraq but we just lost more people in afghanistan more
[1:10:56.400 --> 1:11:00.240]  casualties in afghanistan in half a month really than we have
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:04.320]  in any other month so far in the war so there's obviously firefights going on
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:06.880]  there there's obviously warfare taking place there
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:09.920]  and i don't know if the american people are ready to go into iran without
[1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:12.800]  something of a staged event i thank you for the call the
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:16.800]  uh... craig in new jersey craig you're online
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:20.960]  yesterday hey hey yeah this is actually correct when we are changing
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:24.320]  new jersey oh cool man uh... just calling and giving a count of what
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:27.600]  happened up at the john court on brock obama rally yesterday
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:30.480]  okay uh... we had one of our members
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:35.440]  detained by uh... new jersey state police uh... for handing out dvd
[1:11:35.440 --> 1:11:40.400]  what do you think we have no obama's help we put yeah we put together a car
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:43.840]  uh... a double uh... a double
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:46.240]  uh... disc of endgame and the obama deception
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:50.800]  excellent on one dvd and uh... this is how the police hand out
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:55.200]  and uh... he got grabbed up and escorted to his car
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:11:58.960]  uh... before he got out probably i'd say thirty or forty of them
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:03.120]  and uh... he was escorted off the property and they tried to rain his car
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:06.160]  and they are charging him with anything
[1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:09.200]  uh... now that he was free to go but uh...
[1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:11.840]  i mean you know you're a younger kid so he was kind of
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:14.640]  totally taken aback and intimidated by the whole situation
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:18.480]  so it was a teenager in his early twenties and they they decided to pick him
[1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:21.680]  out of the crowd of people that were handing out dvds try to make a point
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.040]  and then they detained him illegally and but they ended up letting him go in
[1:12:25.040 --> 1:12:27.280]  the long run they didn't like what he was doing
[1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:31.600]  yeah and uh... what what happened was uh... there is probably i think thirty or
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:35.280]  forty people that showed up the protest and we were kind of cordoned off into a
[1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:40.000]  little free speech zone well away from any crowd
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:43.440]  um... we had our own dedicated unit of the new jersey
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:47.760]  stormtrooper i mean state police uh... well sir you're you're just lucky that
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:50.800]  you didn't get tased in the mouth or shot in the face because that's
[1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:54.000]  the kind of country we live in where the law enforcement are the authorities
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.960]  they are the lords they are the gods they make split decisions
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:00.160]  when people like yourself try to go against the status quo i mean
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:04.160]  you're you're challenging obama sir and you know if you don't like that little
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:08.000]  free speech area you won't get none we can just take you down to the jailhouse
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.760]  and that's what they told you we had a we had our video cameras which is in my
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:14.320]  opinion the best weapon against terry ever
[1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:16.960]  absolutely has it been posted on youtube yet
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:20.880]  what that has it been posted on youtube yet uh... we should have it up by tonight
[1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:23.120]  or tomorrow morning now we have some issues of video transfer
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:26.400]  all right well soon as we send it over to jason at we are or not jason we are

[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:45.360]  david in oklahoma david you're online
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:50.240]  hey day uh... hey jason uh... just wanted to let you know prison planet
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:54.720]  member and certainly appreciate the great job that you and alex are doing
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:57.440]  i have a couple things i wanted to talk to you about
[1:13:57.440 --> 1:14:01.120]  the first thing uh... the eugenics movement
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:04.720]  i'm real uh... concerned about this
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:08.080]  swine flu vaccination that they keep talking about
[1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:10.480]  yeah i'm concerned about it too and i really think that they're going to try
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:13.200]  to institute it on an international level
[1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:16.480]  and forcibly inoculate people it really looks like they're going to say
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:19.600]  everyone has to take it i you know it's not a coincidence
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:22.400]  that i'm reading articles two months ago on the air where they say they're
[1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:25.760]  going to have four point nine billion of these vaccines
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:29.680]  four point nine billion
[1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:34.080]  you with me david yeah it's a little more serious for me because i have uh...
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:38.880]  children and uh... you know research in the law up here in oklahoma
[1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:43.680]  um... i just found out that you know uh... you don't have to
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:49.920]  uh... to come to the you know forced vaccines and inoculations under state
[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:53.920]  law and it actually says that you know if you uh...
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:58.240]  you know at object to on a religious or moral ground
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:01.920]  then you can you know avoid getting inoculated but
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:05.840]  i'm real concerned about that and if i can ask you two other things real
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:10.960]  quickly um... for your your listeners commenting about
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:15.680]  you know getting the word out i think the best thing that we can do
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:18.560]  is just we're winning the war we're winning the
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:23.520]  with uh... with the information war we just have to open up people's eyes
[1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:28.320]  and uh... you know if they if they question the legality or
[1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:33.040]  you know the legitimate legitimate argument that is being put forth
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:36.240]  then show them where it is on the internet pull it up for
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:39.760]  exactly you have to be johnny on the spot with that information that's what's
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:43.280]  so great about some of these smartphones i mean technology is another tool
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:46.800]  out there that can be used to empower or enslave them we're talking about these
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:50.480]  autobots and these you know robotics that have a i that are going to have
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:53.920]  military applications in your iphone is one of these things that can cause you
[1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:57.920]  to be slothful and lazy and just totally into pop culture but your iphone
[1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:01.600]  can also be something that you can look up something on youtube and say no it's
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:05.280]  right here or pull up a pdf file off a government website and say no
[1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:10.160]  here's the bill so again it's all how you use the tools that you're given
[1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:14.320]  and i think that the end game and the obama deception are very powerful
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:19.280]  uh viewing parties are a necessity and my last question is regarding and this
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:23.360]  ties into eugenics as well uh the water supply i know
[1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:26.560]  one of your first callers was talking about all the chemicals
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:30.400]  do you think that we can ever get back to where
[1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:34.560]  we can get these pollutants out of our water supply certainly get less of them
[1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:37.760]  number one yeah certainly get less and i and you know if we made a concerted
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:40.800]  effort i don't see why we couldn't get rid of them completely
[1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:44.560]  with filtration systems that would get rid of this stuff but it's going i mean
[1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:48.240]  that's a very uphill battle most people would are
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:51.920]  are just in so much denial about that they refuse to even acknowledge the
[1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:54.560]  subject because they don't like the fact that they're being poisoned on a
[1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:58.160]  daily basis so they choose to ignore it and act like it doesn't exist and a lot
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:01.600]  of people just kind of recoil from fear when you
[1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:04.160]  tell them yeah there's chloroform in the water and
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:08.800]  you know sodium fluoride and barium and all sorts of other terrible and mercury
[1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:11.520]  so you know maybe we shouldn't be drinking or
[1:17:11.520 --> 1:17:14.720]  or using that water supply they don't want to hear it thank you for the call
[1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:19.440]  great points dave uh let's go to daniel in arkansas daniel you're online
[1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:23.840]  hey dave now we're going good um i just want to see if anybody is aware of this
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:28.240]  actually an article on nss.gov the national science foundation
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:32.080]  uh it titled solar cycle link to global climate
[1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:35.840]  and it just says how the solar cycle they've you know found out through
[1:17:35.840 --> 1:17:40.400]  research that it actually does cause climate change but it only a small
[1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:43.520]  fraction of it compared to like what the humans are doing to the earth
[1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:47.040]  supposedly so wait in the real world you're admitting to the sun cycle but
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:50.080]  they're saying that man is still causing global warming that's what you're
[1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:53.360]  telling me yeah in one paragraph in the middle of the article it mentions
[1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:56.560]  this man that's what i like to call controlled opposition
[1:17:56.560 --> 1:17:59.280]  uh what they'll do is they'll take something that is a fact that the solar
[1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:03.280]  cycle does affect climate change again we were once pangea folks the earth
[1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:07.040]  oh didn't always look this way i'm sure the great deserts weren't always
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:10.720]  deserts but none of us are around to see that that gradual climate change
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:14.960]  and it is the solar cycle the solar cycle is the reason we're going into this
[1:18:14.960 --> 1:18:18.480]  different climate change and you notice they changed it from global warming
[1:18:18.480 --> 1:18:23.360]  in the 80s and chlorofluorocarbons to carbon dioxide from the 80s to the 90s
[1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:28.400]  it's all propaganda to control you to tax you to say you can't live here or if
[1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:32.800]  you live here you have to pay this amount it's truly a eugenics program and i
[1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:35.920]  encourage anybody that still believes in this farce
[1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:39.040]  of man-made global warming by the way i'm not saying that men
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:42.400]  can't create pollution we obviously do that on a great level
[1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:46.240]  in many areas and that is a concern that is a concern
[1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:50.080]  but go watch the great global warming swindle from the vbc it's readily
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:52.640]  available on youtube it's readily available on google
[1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:56.320]  video it will really open your eyes to the truth about what this whole thing

[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:41.200]  183 in northwest austin area code 512 250
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:45.440]  1591 we stock the e-foods freedom unit we stock

[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:54.960]  which is a screen which we can sell in the open market to somebody who
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:58.000]  doesn't have to buy it from me right you know you mean a product that's
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:01.280]  produced here in the united states made here in the united states and used by

[1:33:18.720 --> 1:33:22.480]  gonna go to Chris John Larry and others in this long segment but first I want to
[1:33:22.480 --> 1:33:27.520]  talk about this process of confirming Judge Sotomayor it looks like
[1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:32.000]  that is the process I mean there's really no debate they use the same
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:35.760]  point over and over again the wise Latina woman the wise Latina woman
[1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:39.440]  the false left right paradigm then feeds into that you know you watch
[1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:43.920]  Rachel Maddow or you watch Keith Oberman and they over and over again
[1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:47.760]  make the point that that's what they're focusing on but they're not focusing on
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:52.240]  the La Raza council membership they're not focusing on the Belizean grove
[1:33:52.240 --> 1:33:56.560]  and they're obviously not focusing on America's deadly obsession where she
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:33:59.040]  says that we don't have the right to have guns
[1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:02.640]  well it's not just guns uh what what's her what's her stance on abortion
[1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:06.000]  has she clarified that uh you know I haven't watched all the hearings I
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.720]  couldn't tell you hasn't I think she's been dancing around everything like
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:11.920]  they always do me it's just it's a dog and pony show the woman is a
[1:34:11.920 --> 1:34:15.600]  is a is an elitist shield just like all the rest of them
[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:19.200]  and it's just for our entertainment but the second amendment I mean what is
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:23.040]  that we don't need that Obama's president now yeah no we have a
[1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:26.800]  biomass eating robots why would we need firearms we don't need firearms to send
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:31.040]  them in after that guys they might hurt the biomass eating robots
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:35.120]  you know I mean what what's sort of my or's position on the second amendment
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:38.080]  is oh yeah I have friends who hunt mm-hmm
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:41.040]  isn't that people you should say well I I know people that are black
[1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:45.040]  okay does that make me okay you know I have friends that hunt
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:48.720]  well what is hunting you have to do the second amendment tell me and not only
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:51.600]  that you know again she tries to skirt the issue but then she doesn't answer
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:54.080]  the question whatsoever she just says I have friends who hunt me
[1:34:54.080 --> 1:34:56.880]  doesn't mean she's in favor of that either well Jason you're from New York
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:59.600]  right well you would I would have to excuse you not knowing as much about
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:02.960]  hunting as people from Texas you would think that but I have deer everywhere
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:06.240]  deer oh my god I've been in four different car accidents with deer
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:09.360]  they're all over the place it's big enough state new york all the city folk
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:12.400]  come up to the Catskill mountains to shoot the deer now I've been around the
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:15.440]  whole dressing situation oh yeah that's everything I throw it on the back and
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:19.760]  the whole night well uh the the second has nothing to do with hunting do nothing
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:23.600]  you know the right of hunters to stalk and shoot bambi shall not be in French
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:26.400]  I mean where does it say that in the Constitution in fact it doesn't it
[1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:30.000]  actually reflects that the people are the militia that they're the ones that
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:33.600]  are in charge of upholding the Constitution and Bill of Rights
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:37.440]  absolutely and if a government gets too tyrannical they then have the right to
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:40.960]  rise up against that government I remember years ago
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:45.520]  um now Susanna Hupp who was whose parents were killed in the Colleen Lubies
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:48.240]  many years ago because she didn't have her gun in her purse
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:52.240]  that's what got concealed carry in Texas going uh you know she was in Lubies
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:54.800]  without her without her gun because it was illegal to have it and her parents
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:57.760]  got blown away but it's not right well she was
[1:35:57.760 --> 1:36:00.720]  testifying before the U.S. congress many years ago right in front of
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:04.720]  Chuckie Schumer my favorite then congressman now senator
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:09.200]  and she looked at him and she said quote I'm not going to be very popular in
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:13.040]  this room by saying this but the second amendment has nothing to do with
[1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:17.280]  duck hunting it's about people like me being able to protect ourselves
[1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:21.040]  from people like you and that's exactly right and Chuckie was
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:23.760]  fuming you can see the steam coming out of his ears
[1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:26.880]  you know that's what the second amendment is all about and when Sotomayor
[1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:30.240]  says oh oh I have friends who hunt it's that is
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:34.320]  irrelevant to the second amendment completely irrelevant you know I told
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:37.600]  it a little bit of this story earlier but I had my landlord come over and
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:40.560]  changed my dry rod and he's with his son his son's joining the military
[1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:43.520]  and he pulls out one of those utility knives you know one of the ones that's
[1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:46.960]  going to be banned it's a switchblade now it's more than four inches eight out
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:50.240]  of ten knives are now getting banned in this country just
[1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:53.440]  totally sick totally disgusting totally degrading and I mentioned it to him
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:56.640]  and he's well aware of it because he's like uh it doesn't matter to me
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:01.920]  military's exempt and I'm like well guess what it matters to me why why
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:05.680]  should the military even have knives that I'm not allowed to have
[1:37:05.680 --> 1:37:09.360]  absolutely and during the actual revolutionary war if you want to get
[1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:14.880]  down to just the statistics of it the militia guys mostly carry rifles
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:18.480]  barrels that are rifle more accurate the guys in the british army or what not
[1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:21.120]  they carried a brown vest musket it was a smoothbore musket
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:24.000]  he pointed in general direction and there was enough of you fired in the right
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  spot you hit somebody so the militia actually had better weapons
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:31.680]  than the regular army yeah that'll never be the case again well come on now
[1:37:31.680 --> 1:37:35.600]  so let's walk why can't we yeah no I agree and I was making you know I talked to him
[1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:39.680]  about the xm-25 and the smart bullets and the technology the military is openly
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:44.000]  using now and I think that we've gone into such a
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:47.840]  technocracy it would be impossible for the people ever to compete in a
[1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:50.880]  military sense however that doesn't say that we should just turn in our guns
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:55.520]  and bow down to our masters we still have to a keep away the police state we
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:59.120]  have to keep the military and the police separate I mean that's
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:03.600]  that's common you know posi commentatus is there for a reason and as much as
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:07.360]  they try to tear down that idea we have to keep upholding oh
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:10.880]  absolutely and you know another thing soto mayores said is that you know she
[1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:14.000]  has somebody of some relative of hers is in the nra
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.560]  ooh what is the nra I mean all they do is promote shooting sports and things
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:22.480]  they're they're pretty wimpy really if you really really get get right down to
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:26.160]  it on the the real purpose of the second amendment they want to protect the
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:29.520]  hunters and the shooters and every once in a while they say something nice about
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:33.200]  personal self-defense with they they're not real real good about
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:36.480]  the real core meaning of the second amendment well that's why we support gun
[1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:39.840]  owners dot org here at the alex jones show
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:44.000]  I was reading this article uh in the segment for walmart needs industry
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:47.280]  support for green labels so now you can walk into your local
[1:38:47.280 --> 1:38:50.720]  slave mart and you'll be buying products with a nice little label that makes you
[1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:53.840]  feel better and say oh the the carbon impact of this
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:56.640]  product isn't that much at all isn't it so good
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:00.240]  what this really means is shoddier products for more money
[1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:06.560]  in a slave mart situation green labels green labels I hope they don't have the
[1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:11.280]  wrong kind of dye and labels I mean no you know what I'm sure they'll make them
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:15.360]  look really earthy but they'll still be put together by indonesian kids in
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:19.040]  some far off third world country well unless the indonesian kids start to
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:21.680]  make more money than the kids they can find someplace else well that's really
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:24.480]  the point isn't it isn't it to bring everybody to kind of
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:27.920]  second world status I mean you look at let's look at china as an example
[1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:31.840]  you know in the 80s they got the coca-cola they got the Levi's genes they
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:35.120]  got the mcdonald's you know they westernized a little bit not much they
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:38.480]  still had their one child policies they still had their police state they
[1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:42.080]  still have their ultimate rulers their dictatorship the military are the police
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:45.280]  there they still have that but then you look at the united states
[1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:48.560]  and what have we taken from their culture well now it suddenly it's okay to
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:52.160]  have the military on police or on the streets suddenly it's okay to have
[1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:56.240]  youth groups suddenly we're talking about bio and geo engineering suddenly
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:59.520]  we're talking about one child policies what do you got against youth groups oh
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:03.200]  yeah youth brigades are always good when their state sponsored you know what I
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:06.320]  always said about teenagers I hope I don't offend any teenagers but
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:10.640]  teenagers are the dumbest people on the planet I disagree with you there it
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:14.320]  wasn't so long ago I'll tell you what teenagers the dumbest people on the
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:17.200]  planet okay ten-year-old knows he doesn't know anything
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:19.920]  you know he realizes it you know a teenager doesn't know anything either
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:22.640]  but he thinks he knows everything well I'm not gonna war
[1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:25.440]  he's some of the dumbest people on the body I guess I'm not gonna say I wasn't
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:28.480]  cocky and arrogant as a teenager but I know plenty of middle-aged people I was
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:32.240]  smarter than even then well and that was over a decade ago I'm gonna be 30 in
[1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:35.520]  like two weeks well your exception to the rule exception to the rule most
[1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:39.040]  teenagers are are dumb because they think they're smart and listen
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:42.720]  yeah but the thing is that their parents in most cases are just as dumb
[1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:46.880]  especially nowadays they're like look at my suv let's take the example you know
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:50.640]  five ten years ago they're the ones driving this eddie bower mobile trying
[1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:54.000]  to be like socially acceptable at the soccer mom circles and
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:57.280]  over at the kids games and what's socially acceptable let's talk about the
[1:40:57.280 --> 1:41:01.760]  latest sports team and the college game that was on last night and look at the
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:04.160]  bumper sticker I have or the pennant on my car
[1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:09.920]  jason jason look look kids sports can be relevant to current politics and how's
[1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:14.400]  that because when I was younger and my kids were little I was a soccer coach
[1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:17.200]  and you know what I had to carry with me when we went to tournaments
[1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:20.400]  when we register our kids to play in tournaments I had to carry a folder on
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:23.360]  each kid which included the kids birth certificate
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:26.560]  really yeah because you had to prove your kid was eligible to play in the
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:29.840]  league because lots of parents who try to play their kid down to make them look
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:33.280]  yeah yeah yeah so you had to carry the kids birth certificate in order to play
[1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:36.960]  little league little kid soccer but to be president you don't got a pony up your
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:41.280]  birth there there's relevance here I guess I guess there's
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:45.120]  so well you know what there's also and I think that the reason that people latch
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:48.480]  on to sports is because we really don't have anything else where we get
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:51.360]  together and we go for a common goal and you have that
[1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:55.200]  adrenaline rush I think sports actually does teach a lot of kids
[1:41:55.200 --> 1:42:00.240]  discipline and respect and goal orientated behavior you know reach out for
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:04.560]  that goal work hard for it but the problem is a lot of that does not go
[1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:08.720]  into the real world beyond you know they lose it as they go to college or they
[1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:12.560]  get that first job and then they try to latch on to it again
[1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:16.000]  by thinking that they're part of the Yankees or the Mets they don't really
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.480]  learn the the things that they learned again
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:22.880]  coming together common goals the greater good you know working towards a goal
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:26.560]  instead they're like the goal they're working towards is to see their team
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:31.120]  win the pennant and even you what in your in your analysis there went back to
[1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:36.720]  New York didn't you I can't help myself I am
[1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:41.200]  you are healthy we're gonna get into this uh Facebook police rated my family
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:44.480]  barbecue we've we've reported on this before federal agencies
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:48.240]  surveilling Facebook local police broke up a prom party
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:51.680]  they're like no new jersey kids no prom party for you
[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:55.440]  how dare you put it on Facebook and this is even worse this is a SWAT team
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:42:58.640]  saying it was a raid guns drawn we're gonna get into that in a moment we're
[1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:02.480]  gonna take some calls uh chris in Missouri chris chris hung up so we're

[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:26.800]  times i've interviewed uh steven jones on several occasions we're well aware
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:31.360]  of the latest paperwork where they published the findings of unexploded
[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:36.080]  thermite in the dust about three weeks ago right big fans of their work
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:40.960]  okay i can't get you in san Antonio but stationary on

[1:44:21.760 --> 1:44:25.360]  yeah that that last little bit that came out three weeks ago i mean why isn't
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:30.000]  that mainstream headlines all over the world might even be six weeks ago
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.880]  seven weeks ago yeah ever long ago it was i mean when you have
[1:44:32.880 --> 1:44:37.280]  unexploded super thermite in in all the dust samples that are tested and when
[1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:40.800]  the scientists put it in their little gizmo and they heat it up and it goes
[1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:46.720]  boom i mean this is unreal proof this is
[1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:50.320]  this is like fingerprints all over the bloody knives everywhere
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:54.400]  so why isn't it being covered by the mainstream media jason i don't understand
[1:44:54.400 --> 1:44:57.200]  well yeah because the mainstream media is so good and they have our best
[1:44:57.200 --> 1:44:59.280]  interests at heart so they have to lie to us sometimes
[1:44:59.280 --> 1:45:03.120]  yeah well it's maybe it maybe it's not in our best interest to know that
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:08.000]  super thermite unexploded super thermite is all over the world trade center dust
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:11.600]  and and and we'd like an explanation now you don't understand plans cause
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:16.640]  buildings to fall on top of themselves in uniform fashion at unprecedented
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:18.640]  speeds even when they don't hit up even when they
[1:45:18.640 --> 1:45:22.560]  don't hit the building yes yes building seven obviously seven to fall down
[1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:26.800]  yes but this super thermite thing i mean this is scientific peer reviewed
[1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:30.960]  i mean uh somebody tell me how unexploded super thermite
[1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:34.240]  got in the world trade center dust please i would like well let's well let's
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:38.160]  talk for a second about that because you know we're almost eight years after
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:42.640]  9 11 there have been zero let me say that again zero instances where
[1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:46.400]  quote-unquote terrorists were able to smuggle explosives into
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:50.640]  anywhere in the united states however the u.s government through drills and
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:54.240]  exercises was able to get explosives into 10 buildings
[1:45:54.240 --> 1:45:58.000]  over the last couple years amazing that's weird i just want to see real people
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.640]  can't do it bob and the terrorists can't do it
[1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:04.960]  but the government seems to be able to do it well obviously al-qaeda must be way
[1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:09.200]  more sophisticated than we think they are boy for them to be able to bring all
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:12.640]  that tons of super thermite into those buildings and hook it all up and
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:15.120]  and ram planes into there for no apparent reason
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:19.920]  absolutely yeah no it makes a ton of sense a huge huge uncovered story in
[1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:22.880]  the mainstream media and there's still complicit with it
[1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:27.040]  completely completely complicit they're totally controlled i i absolutely agree
[1:46:27.040 --> 1:46:29.760]  larry in california larry online
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:31.920]  yeah thanks for having me on jason you got it
[1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:35.680]  well uh... i just wanted to mention something uh...
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:41.040]  i actually had court the other day uh... and i want to uh... bring out how
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:45.520]  they're using uh... the draft for
[1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:49.600]  uh... young young men that are in court for like child support
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:53.680]  and unemployed i was uh...
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:56.320]  number ten on the list to be called up
[1:46:56.320 --> 1:47:00.960]  and every single guy before me because i'd sat in the front row i could hear
[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:04.720]  everything the public defender i could say in everything and
[1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:08.240]  uh... every every young man that was up there
[1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:12.640]  uh... was asked if he'd signed up for selective services
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:15.680]  and uh... they really kind of it was like
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:17.680]  the guy was pushing it
[1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:21.120]  so you really think that maybe they might be gearing up to open up uh... be
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:23.840]  either the draft in other words military conscription
[1:47:23.840 --> 1:47:26.880]  or perhaps a military force in the united states where they would have to
[1:47:26.880 --> 1:47:31.760]  draft from you know they did just make the dhs officially part of the nsa about
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:35.280]  no they did well that makes me so happy yeah yeah
[1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:38.800]  it's much difference but now they're just admitting that dhs
[1:47:38.800 --> 1:47:42.800]  is going to be absorbed by the national security agency and dhs
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:46.160]  was only put into place supposedly even though it was on the shelf in the
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:49.600]  paperwork was all there and they just seemed to spring this new
[1:47:49.600 --> 1:47:53.840]  administration into life this new bureaucracy because of 9-11 bob
[1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:57.840]  yeah that the concept of the department of homeland security
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:01.600]  which is sounds so teutonic you know you little dutchland little dutchland
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:05.840]  was in place before september 11th and you know that they use it as an excuse
[1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:09.600]  yeah period that's not even debatable i'm with you
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:12.240]  we're gonna go to tray in texas in just a moment but i want to read this story

[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:27.120]  apparently they shut the whole thing down i mean they they didn't say
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:30.160]  oh it looks like there's only 15 people here now they came in
[1:54:30.160 --> 1:54:34.560]  guns a blazing helicopter swooped in eight people think about that
[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:38.720]  eight police officers for 15 people that's uh
[1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:42.080]  that's a little better than a two to one ratio actually bob and two cops for
[1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:44.960]  every person uh i guess mr pool said he spent but
[1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:48.720]  this is out in the uk by the way he spent 800 pounds
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:52.320]  on food and a refrigerator you know he tried to cater the event and they
[1:54:52.320 --> 1:54:55.040]  didn't like it they didn't like i was being advertised on the
[1:54:55.040 --> 1:54:59.360]  internet as an all night party so this is big brother in every sense of the
[1:54:59.360 --> 1:55:01.600]  word and what people have to understand is when they
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:05.120]  join a group or they become a fan of something sometimes these are undercover
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:09.360]  officers posing as other people so that they can see you in their little news
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:13.040]  feed okay and they are tracking and tracing and
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:16.560]  databaseing all these kids and it's not just kids because this is
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:18.720]  something that's i mean this is a 30 year old guy
[1:55:18.720 --> 1:55:21.920]  i would hardly call him a kid this is his 30th birthday party and this is
[1:55:21.920 --> 1:55:26.080]  social networking site that you know more and more middle aged and older
[1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:28.880]  people are using because they see the power of it
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:32.880]  as yet another tool to enslave or empower but this is just outrageous
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:35.440]  i don't know why don't they just go out and find some real crime or something i
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:39.280]  mean the cops in the country all the time do something stupid
[1:55:39.280 --> 1:55:43.120]  you know here in austin several years ago alex was all over this some
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:47.520]  some lady out in west austin somewhere gets this helicopter swat team stomping
[1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:51.600]  on her property because some fool thought that she was growing marijuana in
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:55.440]  her backyard i mean they they got a swat team helicopters guns drawn the whole
[1:55:55.440 --> 1:55:57.600]  nine yard to order everybody the ground
[1:55:57.600 --> 1:56:01.440]  to inspect what turned out to be a real common weed that grows all over texas
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:04.400]  and this was the this was the sheriff's department
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:07.760]  under uh i forgot the name and this was just an old woman right
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:11.440]  yeah just an old lady and here comes the swat team well it shouldn't be a
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:15.360]  surprise i mean hr 1444 is now being passed around congress
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:18.320]  where they're not only talking about compulsory service they're talking
[1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:22.720]  about specifically getting the baby boomer generation involved
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.080]  in this compulsory service and how they'll fit in how boy i can't wait
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:29.600]  yeah 60 plus year old people should really have to serve in a
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:32.720]  a city year or some other kind of a americorba grade
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:36.720]  oh we can pick up the aluminum cans and donate them to the cause or something

[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:47.760]  problem oh they do you think that somebody
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:51.520]  should have to have a permit for 15 people eating burgers in the country i
[1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:54.880]  mean you look at the shot and i don't know if these guys this got brought
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:57.840]  into me so i didn't send them a link on prism planet dot tv
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:01.760]  but it's a small blue tent i think the in the small blue tent they're showing
[1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:05.760]  you a very minimalized sound system that was not even plugged in yet
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:09.280]  this is 4 p.m when they got raided they didn't even plug in the music
[1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:13.200]  but there's trees everywhere it doesn't even look like the guy has neighbors
[1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:16.720]  oh but how dare they assemble without permission
[1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:21.200]  maybe they write the place because they were cooking meat and we all know meat
[1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:25.920]  is not sustainable that's true what else you got for me tray
[1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:29.520]  uh jason i was watching the today show yesterday morning and there was a
[1:57:29.520 --> 1:57:33.440]  short segment where they were commenting that helery has been
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:37.680]  uh noticeably absent recently for many of her typical duties
[1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:42.000]  they cut to a short scene of hillary speaking with senator rocker feller in
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:45.360]  preparation to provide a briefing to president obama
[1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:49.200]  and in between the uh phrases of the voice over of the today show
[1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:54.080]  correspondent you can clearly hear what hillary is saying to senator rocker
[1:57:54.080 --> 1:57:57.440]  feller in the background and what she said was
[1:57:57.440 --> 1:58:01.280]  i have been briefing the interagency on what has been going on
[1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:05.360]  inside the camp uh i can only speculate as to what she's
[1:58:05.360 --> 1:58:09.120]  referring to but of course i i hit record on the tivo and
[1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:13.360]  watched it several times and uh you know some of these people have this
[1:58:13.360 --> 1:58:19.120]  perverse pleasure from uh publicly displaying their power uh i just
[1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:22.000]  thought it was rather we're talking to rocker feller kind of makes me think
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:25.200]  that this might be a cyber security thing or her absence i mean we know that
[1:58:25.200 --> 1:58:28.240]  he's starting a new cyber security office we know that he has somebody in
[1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:31.680]  mind as a quote-unquote czar so without seeing the clip

[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:22.320]  i'm fine thank you and uh it's interesting i'm running into more and
[2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:26.240]  more stuff on eugenics and uh and uh so the my
[2:02:26.240 --> 2:02:30.800]  idea uh referred to that in uh roe vs wade
[2:02:30.800 --> 2:02:35.120]  people didn't realize what she was saying but she's spoken before
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:39.600]  about eugenics which we'll get into later well absolutely and one of the
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:42.960]  you know highlight clips we're gonna have to play again in this hour because
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:45.840]  it's just so important is representative joseph
[2:02:45.840 --> 2:02:49.840]  pits out of pennsylvania on the house floor discussing
[2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:53.120]  judge ginsburg and her comments on pro eugenics
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:58.320]  and population sustainability and control and their desire to root out
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:02.800]  you know pop yeah undesirables that's right that's what it is uh mr dacy it's
[2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:06.400]  undesirables yes go ahead i have to do is go back to
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:10.000]  germany and is a very very important word
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  in the german language and it's called onto mention
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:17.840]  and this is what they called the nazis called subhumans
[2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:25.040]  is what it is in english and this was part of only allowing
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:31.280]  the quote intellectual and physical uh and of course in the case of germany
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:38.080]  uh the purity to uh of race to procreate and this is what these
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:41.520]  people are talking about today and even talking
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:45.680]  in america about a couple hundred years and most people don't know it
[2:03:45.680 --> 2:03:48.880]  and i have one of the biggest libraries in eugenics
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:53.760]  anywhere which i ended up giving away to uh u.s.c and uc la because nobody ever
[2:03:53.760 --> 2:03:59.120]  wanted to read them besides me and and so this is where they're headed in america
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:02.640]  and this is how they're going to call the population
[2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:08.800]  uh they're going to use uh selective breeding and and and people are going
[2:04:08.800 --> 2:04:12.320]  to be told you can't breed and if you try to
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:15.680]  you'll be aborted and sterilized well i'm not sure if you've read this
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:19.520]  information but the current health bill that's been passed is actually going to
[2:04:19.520 --> 2:04:22.640]  give and it's only gone through the house like i said
[2:04:22.640 --> 2:04:26.880]  i've right it hasn't been passed by the senate the health bill
[2:04:26.880 --> 2:04:31.360]  i'm pretty sure it's just through the house but but the bill specifically says
[2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:35.600]  that they are providing funding for home visits that promote immunization
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:38.800]  through education so in other words they can enforce
[2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:42.160]  immunizations that you don't want to take by knocking on your door and saying
[2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:45.280]  you must take it more on that on the other side

[2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:21.520]  and again in the health care bill they're saying that federally
[2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:25.920]  they will fund you know state teams to conduct interventions
[2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:29.760]  in private homes and here's just a little subsection the program
[2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:33.520]  authorizing home interventions to promote immunization falls under
[2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:36.880]  subtitle c creating healthier communities so again they're

[2:08:39.840 --> 2:08:43.520]  this sub subtitle directs the secretary of health and human services
[2:08:43.520 --> 2:08:47.040]  to establish a demonstration program to award grants
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:50.480]  to states to improve the provision of recommended immunizations
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:54.960]  or children adolescents and adults through the use of evidence-based

[2:09:06.960 --> 2:09:10.560]  whether you like it or not exactly and you know with all this hype
[2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:14.160]  surrounding the swine flu and obama's science
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:18.080]  czar openly writing about this stuff how do you feel about it mr daisy well i
[2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:21.680]  think it's really neat i mean this john holder and guy wrote this book this
[2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:24.800]  um the back and was in the early 70s and
[2:09:24.800 --> 2:09:28.320]  and it it perfectly dovetails with what we're talking about here he says on
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:31.200]  page seven eighty six through seven eighty seven
[2:09:31.200 --> 2:09:34.720]  the development of a long-term sterilizing capsule
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:38.400]  that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:43.520]  opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:47.360]  the capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable
[2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:52.240]  with official permission or a limited number of births well let's right there
[2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:56.240]  it's all personal let's go back to that term coat coercive fertility control
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:09:59.840]  see in in this memo that they had to put out yesterday as this stuff is starting
[2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:03.760]  to surface they're saying that obama science czar does not support
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:08.000]  coercive population control what is that i'm confused yes
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:12.160]  sounds like semantics to me what's the fertility control but not coercive
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:15.680]  population oh i get it i think that they're synonyms aren't they
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:19.600]  i don't get it i don't get it well it it's the manipulation
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:24.160]  of the language and these guys are masters of manipulating the language and
[2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:27.680]  they do so on so many levels mr chapman
[2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:33.040]  they certainly do and it's amazing that people
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:37.840]  are able to go in and pull out these juicy little tidbits like you just read
[2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:41.120]  about what they're really all about what where they're headed with this thing
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:45.120]  and you know i've been talking about this since the mid-1960s
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:49.280]  and regional government and things like that and people thought we were crazy
[2:10:49.280 --> 2:10:52.960]  and you know here it is now it's happening
[2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:59.120]  and it it's absolutely downright frightening i absolutely agree i kind
[2:10:59.120 --> 2:11:02.320]  of want to jump topics here and get into the economy
[2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:06.720]  i got a couple stories in front of me u.s video game sales post largest
[2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:10.400]  decline since 2000 one of the only really unbeatable
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:13.280]  industries the ones that you've seen grow and grow and grow
[2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:17.840]  despite economic times have been these big blockbuster video games that are now
[2:11:17.840 --> 2:11:20.800]  grossing more than major motion pictures and now
[2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:24.480]  since the first time since 2000 almost a decade ago
[2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:28.400]  they're seeing their largest decline can't be good news for this economy even
[2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:32.080]  g e is saying that their revenues down and we're talking about one of the
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:35.760]  biggest media military industrial complex companies
[2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:42.240]  out there in the world that's correct and um uh we are in
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:11:47.440]  depression we started this past february and uh it's an inflationary
[2:11:47.440 --> 2:11:51.520]  environment and uh that inflationary environment will get
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:56.320]  worse over the next couple years and uh then we'll go into a deflationary
[2:11:56.320 --> 2:11:58.640]  environment i think what's interesting here
[2:11:58.640 --> 2:12:04.320]  is that this is the epitome of kinsienism which is the school of economics
[2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:07.920]  the emphasis to that is classical economics and
[2:12:07.920 --> 2:12:11.920]  it looks like the european central bank which represents 16 of about
[2:12:11.920 --> 2:12:19.520]  29 nations in europe and they are taking the classical tax which is to
[2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:24.160]  uh yes take interest rates down but reduce the amount of money and credit
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:27.760]  being injected in the system and just to show you the difference
[2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:32.400]  the interest rates are all down but on the other hand
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:35.760]  the money supply in the united states and the united kingdom and many other
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:40.080]  nations is up about 18 percent and
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:46.000]  in the eurozone it's only up 3.7 percent
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:49.520]  and that's down from a plus 12.8 about a year and a half ago
[2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:54.160]  so they are taking the other tax in Europe
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:12:58.560]  well what do you think is is going to happen in the next few months in light
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:03.840]  of the last g8 summit in light of this brick conference in light of uh
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:07.440]  russia's medived get out getting out there and showing people
[2:13:07.440 --> 2:13:10.640]  the prototype and a minted prototype might i add
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:17.600]  for a global currency coin well it it's it's it's uh something that
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:23.040]  uh it was bound to come and uh i think what they're really looking for
[2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:27.120]  here is an international trading unit at first
[2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:31.280]  i expect there's going to be another meeting similar
[2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:34.800]  to the smithsonian type meeting that was held in the early 70s
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:38.480]  and the plaza records in 1985 and i think all the nations are going to get
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:42.080]  together within the next six months and i think they're going to realign the
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:45.680]  currencies against one another there'll be all these
[2:13:45.680 --> 2:13:48.400]  cross currencies and they'll have these experts
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:52.560]  working at you know what's going to be devalued and what's going to be revalued
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:56.320]  and i think that's going to happen and i think it's going to be brought on
[2:13:56.320 --> 2:14:01.760]  by pressure on the united states dollar uh the usdx is down from 89.5 it's
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:07.040]  trading around 79.5 and i expected to test 71.18 and if it
[2:14:07.040 --> 2:14:10.480]  does that between now and the end of october
[2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:13.600]  we're going to have pressure on the dollar like we had
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:18.160]  about a year and a third of go when other nations didn't want to accept the
[2:14:18.160 --> 2:14:22.240]  dollar especially in trade and and for people who are on
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:25.840]  vacation things like that if you remember there were stories back then
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:30.400]  about that and i think that's going to happen again and i think it could cause
[2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:35.120]  a short bank holiday in the united states
[2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:39.120]  well that would be something we haven't seen in so long and i it does seem to
[2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:42.080]  be going that way with you know brazil russia
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:45.600]  india and china openly saying that they want a separate
[2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:50.880]  world reserve currency mr daisy i don't want a separate world reserve currency
[2:14:50.880 --> 2:14:54.400]  i would like to have our currency be strong so they stop printing it like
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:57.760]  it's going out of style every five seconds and blowing away the value of it
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:15:01.280]  all the time of course they've been doing it since what 1913
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:04.960]  uh... you know i these people don't even know what classical
[2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:08.480]  economics is i'm not an economics advisor i don't really know that much
[2:15:08.480 --> 2:15:12.480]  about all that stuff but i do know this i was up in a conference
[2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:16.800]  back in 2006 up in waco it was the follow-up conference to that
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:21.520]  uh... nafta thing that they had in in march where bush was up there and they
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:25.360]  were doing the superhighway and was that the captain project or spp free
[2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:28.320]  trader of the america okay i was up there
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:31.760]  uh... for the new american and i was talking to these business people from
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:35.680]  baler university in these economics professors in the top guys that a little
[2:15:35.680 --> 2:15:39.520]  did get together that we had and i brought up uh... you know the
[2:15:39.520 --> 2:15:45.040]  the uh... economic policies of on mrs is how you pronounce his name
[2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:48.800]  and they looked at me like i was crazy they didn't know who he was
[2:15:48.800 --> 2:15:52.320]  i mean literally they didn't know who he was well i know what they didn't know
[2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:55.600]  what i was is the head of the economics department at baler university
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:15:58.640]  didn't know who the guy was they don't understand it
[2:15:58.640 --> 2:16:01.920]  no most of them don't have been trained not trained not to and that's why it's
[2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:05.280]  so important for people listening to this program aware of this information
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:08.400]  to really protect the the wealth that they do have
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:11.280]  by investing in gold and silver and other precious metals
[2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:14.960]  why don't you tell people how they can do that on mr chavin
[2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:20.240]  well i think the best way to get into precious metals is to talk to mitis
[2:16:20.240 --> 2:16:25.280]  and uh... they have uh... uh... a big collection of uh... golden
[2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:29.600]  silver coins and voting for you to purchase and uh...
[2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:34.160]  and they also well will supply you with a free introductory copy to
[2:16:34.160 --> 2:16:37.520]  uh... the international forecaster as well all you have to do is call eight
[2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:43.200]  seven seven four seven nine eight one seven eight that's eight seven seven
[2:16:43.200 --> 2:16:47.680]  four seven nine eight one seven eight uh... i was on the ten innocent thursday
[2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:50.800]  with butch pa which was last night
[2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:56.320]  and uh... uh... we uh... uh... we talked about uh... the availability in the
[2:16:56.320 --> 2:16:59.760]  things that were going on in the golden silver markets
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:02.640]  and there was a one more thing i was going to bring
[2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:06.480]  uh... to four uh... in the confiscated conversation
[2:17:06.480 --> 2:17:11.840]  regarding uh... the dissent of the dollar and and that is i have been told by
[2:17:11.840 --> 2:17:16.320]  extraordinarily reliable sources actually a half dozen of them
[2:17:16.320 --> 2:17:21.040]  that and i believe this information two months ago when nobody else did
[2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:25.200]  and uh... the u.s. embassies have been getting
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:30.160]  u.s. dollars which they are supposed to turn into local currencies
[2:17:30.160 --> 2:17:34.560]  and i don't know in total how many embassies have received it but i know at
[2:17:34.560 --> 2:17:39.200]  least six of them have and i just had another writer send me an email this
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:42.720]  morning and he said i can verify what you're saying
[2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:46.960]  so the government is getting ready for a problem
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:50.480]  well if they do dispense these local currencies and let's say that they do
[2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:53.680]  uh... actually have a bank holiday what is it going to look like in this
[2:17:53.680 --> 2:17:58.560]  country well your a t m credit and debit cards won't
[2:17:58.560 --> 2:18:02.160]  work nobody will accept checks until the banks
[2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:06.240]  you know reopen i don't think they're going to be shut down a long time
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:09.600]  i think it will be perhaps four or five days
[2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:13.120]  and i think it's going to be a trial run a precursor to
[2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:17.360]  what they think is going to happen down the line when they have to shut a wall
[2:18:17.360 --> 2:18:20.720]  for a longer extended period of time perhaps
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:27.760]  when they're going to do these multi country multi currency devaluations
[2:18:27.760 --> 2:18:30.960]  so maybe you think it's going to be a beta test a beta test to see how the
[2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:34.800]  populace will react to not being able to get their money for a week
[2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:37.920]  yes but if they do that what's going to happen with
[2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:40.560]  the when they reopen didn't that get a cause of a bank
[2:18:40.560 --> 2:18:44.400]  run and people are going to freak out the people
[2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:48.640]  people are going to be so happy that the banks are back open they're not going
[2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:52.640]  not going to do too much it's the behavior that they're looking for
[2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:56.800]  in between the time the banks are shut down and they reopen again
[2:18:56.800 --> 2:19:00.480]  so what you're saying is they want to gauge how how much outrage they'll be
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:03.920]  how much public outcry they'll be but they also want to see whether or not
[2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:06.560]  they can convince those people who have that kind of an outcry
[2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:09.600]  not to take all their money out of banks and send you know basically convince
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:12.160]  them that everything's going to be okay
[2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:17.920]  yes that's correct and i think that you probably have the title to this but
[2:19:17.920 --> 2:19:22.560]  uh... this coming week we have maneuvers in the united states
[2:19:22.560 --> 2:19:27.840]  with australian german mexican canadian and u.s troops
[2:19:27.840 --> 2:19:32.640]  and u.k. let's not end private forces by the way
[2:19:32.640 --> 2:19:35.040]  but i know exactly what you're talking about if you don't know what it is it's
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:38.080]  it's national level exercise o nine

[2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:08.240]  barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national
[2:23:08.240 --> 2:23:12.480]  security force that's just as powerful just as strong
[2:23:12.480 --> 2:23:17.920]  just as well funded the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:20.560]  is working for the best interest of the american people
[2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:25.120]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election if
[2:23:25.120 --> 2:23:29.280]  you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:33.040]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:36.560]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[2:23:36.560 --> 2:23:40.160]  it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government
[2:23:40.160 --> 2:23:45.120]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told

[2:24:52.960 --> 2:24:56.480]  enemies if you want to know about the international intelligence agency that
[2:24:56.480 --> 2:25:00.960]  actually did carry out 9 11 we cover it from front to back in this
[2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:03.680]  video very jennings the current vice president of the
[2:25:03.680 --> 2:25:06.800]  united states joseph viden synthia mckinney michael j springman bow
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:12.000]  deedle and so much more fabled enemies go check it out
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:15.520]  now we were talking about this uh state of the economy we're talking about bank
[2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:19.120]  holidays and local currencies
[2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:23.600]  mr. chapman if the government starts issuing local currencies what is the
[2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:26.880]  economy in this country going to look like and and what are we going to be
[2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:30.480]  doing day to day i mean how it how is that going to work
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:34.480]  well as i said i think they'll have a large meeting so to speak
[2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:37.600]  and they'll decide ahead of time how much
[2:25:37.600 --> 2:25:41.600]  one currency is going to be devalued against another and of course all of
[2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:45.200]  those changes are going to make all of those currencies
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:49.680]  degenerate in value versus gold and so that's very important
[2:25:49.680 --> 2:25:54.160]  but i think if they were to do a switch like that now
[2:25:54.160 --> 2:25:59.600]  now there's a thing called the usdx and at six currencies major currencies
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:06.720]  weighted each one against the dollar now the usdx
[2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:11.360]  uh is probably at the state and it's in now
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:15.280]  you would probably see somewhere between a 50 percent
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:18.960]  and 70 percent reduction of the dollar
[2:26:18.960 --> 2:26:22.960]  versus that group of currencies that six currencies
[2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:28.800]  and that's one heck of a devaluation but what would have to happen at the same
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:31.600]  time they would have to be a adjustment of
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:36.400]  debt between countries because 64.5 percent of all of the foreign
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:40.160]  exchange held by other countries is in dollars
[2:26:40.160 --> 2:26:43.200]  so everybody's going to take a haircut if they do that
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:48.640]  and i think that's coming well that is just uh it's nightmarish uh i wonder
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:52.560]  what happens to other localized concern uh currencies that are outside of
[2:26:52.560 --> 2:26:56.320]  government control like say the Lakota rounds
[2:26:56.320 --> 2:27:00.080]  well they do up in value silver and gold will go up in value
[2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:04.080]  if the the value of the gold dollar let's say went down 50 percent
[2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:07.920]  then we would assume that gold and silver would rise 50 percent
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:10.720]  but doesn't that put them in kind of a spot a lot more
[2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:14.960]  but you i understand that the rounds essentially would be worth more
[2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:18.560]  but actually in those communities where they're using the rounds as currency
[2:27:18.560 --> 2:27:20.960]  don't you think the federal government is going to want to step in
[2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:24.560]  and further regulate them i mean when you look at this uh exercise that you're
[2:27:24.560 --> 2:27:30.080]  talking about national level exercise 09 is is in fema region six that means
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:33.840]  texas arizona parts of california basically
[2:27:33.840 --> 2:27:36.880]  the southwest and there are indian reservations there
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:39.600]  and they state specifically in these documents that they're going to be
[2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:43.680]  going after state local and tribal governments basically
[2:27:43.680 --> 2:27:47.200]  this is a huge federal takeover but it's really an international takeover
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:50.320]  because like you stated before we're talking about governments in canada
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:56.640]  mexico australia the uk and then private organizations also taking part
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:01.200]  well that's correct and uh you know we were just going to have to watch what
[2:28:01.200 --> 2:28:04.320]  they do because we don't know exactly what they are
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:09.040]  going to do we have to learn as much from what they're doing as they do
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:13.040]  and then we have to broadcast let everybody know about it because
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:15.280]  certainly mainline media is not going to carry it
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:18.400]  that's right and it's it's for it's for i'm sorry
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:22.320]  it's for a full week and people really do need to arm themselves
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:25.840]  with cameras and questions if we want to expose this to the world
[2:28:25.840 --> 2:28:30.000]  via info wars and youtube mr daisy i want to know from bob i have a question
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  from about this bank holiday thing i mean i'm a retailer you know have a local
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:38.240]  hardware store as how does that affect the guy on the street i'm in the real
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:41.600]  world you know mainstream america real business
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:44.000]  you know people getting their toilet fixed and
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:48.080]  getting their light bulbs changed and all that how does that affect the average
[2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:51.440]  retail establishment during a bank holiday what happens
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:54.880]  you don't take credit cards or what what how does that how does that play out
[2:28:54.880 --> 2:28:58.640]  well you you can't because it won't function and neither will atm
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:02.320]  well then nothing will function well that's true
[2:29:02.320 --> 2:29:05.200]  and i mean that's what everybody uses money in gold
[2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:08.800]  or there will be some establishment i'm sure
[2:29:08.800 --> 2:29:14.720]  that'll accept checks incumbent upon the problem being solved and of course
[2:29:14.720 --> 2:29:17.520]  government will say well we'll have this fixed in a few days so don't worry
[2:29:17.520 --> 2:29:20.080]  about it but wait a minute bob won't that also cause an
[2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:23.680]  artificial run on the banks if places start actually taking
[2:29:23.680 --> 2:29:27.920]  checks that are say post-dated to when the banks reopen won't there be just an
[2:29:27.920 --> 2:29:32.720]  exorbitant amount of checks that are post-dated for when this bank holiday ends
[2:29:32.720 --> 2:29:35.920]  which could then again cripple these banks once more i want to get your
[2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:39.600]  opinion on that on the other side we're going to be taking your calls tony rob

[2:31:21.200 --> 2:31:24.880]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:31:24.880 --> 2:31:27.760]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:31:27.760 --> 2:31:31.280]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again

[2:33:37.760 --> 2:33:42.080]  joneshow i am jason bermus sitting in i'm gonna be with you on sunday as well
[2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:45.600]  we're about to in the next 30 minutes we're gonna play a
[2:33:45.600 --> 2:33:49.680]  eugenics rant by alex jones hopefully he is gonna call in before the end of the
[2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:53.360]  show but we just posed the question to mr desi if they do have
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:56.720]  these bankrupt or not mr desi i'm sorry mr chatman the bob and bob thing is
[2:33:56.720 --> 2:33:59.680]  killing me right now but mr chatman if they do
[2:33:59.680 --> 2:34:04.000]  have this bank holiday and people do start accepting checks that are
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:08.320]  post-dated which may be the only way to really have transactions like you said
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:10.320]  because there's not going to be a lot of cash available
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:13.120]  people won't be able to use their credit cards they can't use their atm
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:16.640]  cards they're going to be totally completely shut down won't that cause
[2:34:16.640 --> 2:34:20.240]  an artificial bank run whether or not there's an actual bank run with people
[2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:22.640]  taking all their money out an artificial bank run
[2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:25.600]  on the day that they reopen because everybody's going to be cashing these
[2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:27.760]  checks
[2:34:27.760 --> 2:34:31.680]  no i don't think it it'll be that teres they
[2:34:31.680 --> 2:34:36.400]  they have the ability to process them and and even if they were backed up for
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:39.920]  two or three days uh it's no biggie it's just that
[2:34:39.920 --> 2:34:43.520]  many accounts wouldn't get credited as quickly as people would like
[2:34:43.520 --> 2:34:47.520]  but they'll sort that out i i don't think that's going to be a big thing
[2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:51.520]  uh the important thing is that people are going to learn that these kind of
[2:34:51.520 --> 2:34:55.440]  things can happen again like they happened in the 1930s
[2:34:55.440 --> 2:34:58.880]  and secondly they're going to uh rediscover
[2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:02.720]  how important gold and silver is a medium of exchange
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:06.560]  and i think that that will come into play especially
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:10.320]  a silver and small coins like the sovereign and so on
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:16.640]  and it it it it it it's it's just again i think a trial run
[2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:22.400]  uh to build up to something bigger that they got in mind later on
[2:35:22.400 --> 2:35:25.120]  what do you think i want to know what that's something bigger that they got
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:28.880]  in mind later on is i think it might be that coin that uh medved was holding
[2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:31.920]  over there i mean that coin just creeps me out that they've actually
[2:35:31.920 --> 2:35:37.200]  minted a global currency coin remember there it's in beta test stage but just
[2:35:37.200 --> 2:35:39.760]  that they have it there and they're like this is what we want
[2:35:39.760 --> 2:35:44.080]  and they're holding these meetings again this brick meeting this brazil russia
[2:35:44.080 --> 2:35:48.000]  uh india and china meeting they're openly saying we don't like the dollar
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:51.200]  we want to kick it in the back we will actually they want to cut its throat it's
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:35:54.320]  already like you know crippled on its knees and like
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:57.200]  chained up they just want to cut the throat of it and just bleed it out
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:36:02.480]  well i i just think just as a as a retailer who day to day just rings up
[2:36:02.480 --> 2:36:05.200]  hundreds of sales all the time that's what i do
[2:36:05.200 --> 2:36:09.840]  i though it would just paralyze the whole country if they if they had a bank
[2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:13.040]  holiday people get people get mad if i open five minutes late
[2:36:13.040 --> 2:36:16.720]  yeah but you know what they do some things they probably pull stunts not
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:19.040]  only in the media but in sports they'd be like
[2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:23.440]  free day to come on down to the stadium and see the texas rangers play it's a
[2:36:23.440 --> 2:36:27.200]  bank holiday it's not first you know 20 000 that show up
[2:36:27.200 --> 2:36:30.720]  they'd be you know motivating people and really shutting down what's left of the
[2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:33.600]  real economy hey man the social engineers are smart
[2:36:33.600 --> 2:36:36.800]  all that's all i know all right let's take some calls for uh bob daisie and

[2:37:01.600 --> 2:37:04.720]  looking for a good hardware store because i ain't going to home depot well
[2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:08.000]  well it's late well you think i paid this guy to call in right

[2:37:29.120 --> 2:37:32.720]  oh i got you and now we don't rent toilet augers either because we don't want
[2:37:32.720 --> 2:37:38.160]  to darn things back we sell them you know what else you got for us tony
[2:37:38.160 --> 2:37:42.480]  first i really i really called to talk about hidey and spencer and torture but
[2:37:42.480 --> 2:37:46.480]  i just wanted to say something real fast john mender king is well known to have
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:52.240]  been something of a sexual deviant he kept sex diaries one of which is encoded
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:56.720]  he liked to photograph young boys and i think the whole idea of stealing from
[2:37:56.720 --> 2:38:01.040]  the future of someone else for your own perverse gratification kind of carries
[2:38:01.040 --> 2:38:05.440]  through into his economics however having said that
[2:38:05.440 --> 2:38:09.760]  you know i saw that uh hidey and spencer were claiming torture and so the whole
[2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:14.080]  time that i was hearing this i was thinking it was over something i actually
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:18.000]  saw on that show in which they literally
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:23.040]  waterboarded the contestants and i was a celebrity get me out of here
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:26.240]  yes one of the challenges they had an octagon
[2:38:26.240 --> 2:38:31.440]  with the little teeter boards attached to the side of like a octagonal baby pool
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:35.920]  filled with spiders and snakes they had people on an incline board with their
[2:38:35.920 --> 2:38:39.920]  head lower than their chest they had them in goggles and a protective
[2:38:39.920 --> 2:38:45.520]  jumpsuit and snakes and spiders crawling all over them and john sally's urge
[2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:48.800]  you know trash talking people go ahead quit you don't want to quit
[2:38:48.800 --> 2:38:52.720]  and i like well this is the usual spiders and snakes reality show garbage
[2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:57.360]  but then the pool starts filling up with water
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:39:01.440]  and it gets all the way up to their nose and once it got up to the nose
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:04.000]  nobody lasted longer than two or three seconds
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:10.640]  bonjaya from american idol one oh he would come to that my god i can get
[2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:15.520]  waterboarded apparently more than than uh janice dickinson and whoever else
[2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:19.920]  well you know alex jones would tell you that this is just the standard dehumanization
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:23.120]  of a culture it's getting you desensitized to this sort of thing he
[2:39:23.120 --> 2:39:25.920]  wasn't a big fan you know even though he's had joe rogan on the program and
[2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:28.640]  their friends he wasn't a big fan of some of the things they did on there
[2:39:28.640 --> 2:39:32.240]  especially when they were taking metal spikes and throwing them through there
[2:39:32.240 --> 2:39:36.400]  and this this water uh boarding debate has really just gotten out of control i
[2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:40.400]  thank you for the call it is quite obvious that this is torture mr dacy
[2:39:40.400 --> 2:39:43.680]  well tell of it the television is torture i mean the stuff that they put on the
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:47.600]  air nowadays is just complete and total garbage is meant to make us think like
[2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:50.080]  we're a bunch of animals and then appeared
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:54.400]  appeal to our pure inside i really like leave it to beaver you know and i like
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:58.320]  father knows best now and i like i like gilligan i was a dentist the menace
[2:39:58.320 --> 2:40:01.120]  guy maybe a little more commending well you know you know a little bit
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:05.440]  monsters yeah you know what whatever happened to you know andy of mayberry
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:09.120]  you know whatever happened to the decent shows the vast majority of what's on
[2:40:09.120 --> 2:40:12.960]  tv now is total garbage well what's your take on
[2:40:12.960 --> 2:40:16.480]  pop culture and what's on the television and shows like this where they are
[2:40:16.480 --> 2:40:20.080]  you know dehumanizing people to desensitize them to things like torture
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:23.440]  and waterboarding they're trying to turn us in they were into what they think we
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:26.320]  are well that's what that's basically it they're
[2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:28.720]  trying to turn us into what they think we already are
[2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:32.800]  well just lovely let's go to rob in new jersey robert online
[2:40:32.800 --> 2:40:37.920]  hey how are you doing good um basically i heard a caller earlier calling about
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:41.520]  uh thinking about the military gearing up for something
[2:40:41.520 --> 2:40:46.480]  um i have prior service uh in the past and was uh discharged for not being
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:49.360]  mrs qualified within 24 months federal law
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:53.840]  okay and basically i received the email uh within the week and it basically
[2:40:53.840 --> 2:40:57.440]  said you know you can join back in don't have to go to maps you don't have to do
[2:40:57.440 --> 2:41:02.160]  nothing you can go right in pick a job and go to your schooling
[2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:05.840]  basically being that kind of desperate to recruit as many people as possible
[2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:08.800]  into the military you know we just had that caller earlier saying that people
[2:41:08.800 --> 2:41:11.760]  who were accused of small and petty crimes and i thank you for the call
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:15.040]  were they were making sure that they'd signed in for selective service
[2:41:15.040 --> 2:41:19.120]  we also know people they'll they'll try to send you to shock camp or say hey join
[2:41:19.120 --> 2:41:22.960]  the military after you've done something stupid like use drugs or
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:27.680]  sold drugs to others and they're having a tough time selling this
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:30.480]  military to people because we're still in afghanistan
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:34.400]  we're still in iraq and we're still beating the war's drum
[2:41:34.400 --> 2:41:38.160]  against iran speaking of that jason i just have to say this i i had a
[2:41:38.160 --> 2:41:41.600]  fellow young man in my store uh yesterday he had just joined the
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:45.040]  marine corps nice guy really nice guy and he's all
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:48.800]  he's all proud he was a private first class in the marine corps and
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:54.160]  and uh we were talking and i just had to bring up this obama thing about the
[2:41:54.160 --> 2:41:59.040]  the major whose orders to go to afghanistan got uh revoked because he
[2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:01.600]  wanted to sue the president to make him prove that he's
[2:42:01.600 --> 2:42:06.160]  actually qualified to be president if he won't pony up his birth certificate
[2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:08.880]  and we got to talking about that and i was thinking
[2:42:08.880 --> 2:42:12.640]  how i was kind of two minds about talking to him about it because i would
[2:42:12.640 --> 2:42:15.920]  i told the young man is you know this he listened and he
[2:42:15.920 --> 2:42:19.040]  he understood the the constitutional problems involved
[2:42:19.040 --> 2:42:23.120]  in a commander-in-chief who's a fraud possibly yeah won't prove that he's
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:27.120]  as qualified to be president but i told him i said listen son you know
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:30.720]  marine corps are great thing you you just you just do your job you be a good
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:33.600]  you be a good marine this this is way above your pay grade
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:37.280]  so absorb it maybe but just just stay out of it you know because
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:42.320]  you know marines are you know my dad was a marine my granddad was a marine my
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:46.960]  uncles were marines they're all marines you know and
[2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:50.880]  it's it's it's a shame what they're doing
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:54.000]  yeah no how they manipulate military personnel
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.320]  military personnel and and you know they they they think they're out there to
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:01.280]  protect the united states and the constitution and the bill of rights
[2:43:01.280 --> 2:43:04.320]  and they're being manipulated into doing something which is the exact opposite
[2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:07.760]  it's it's so it's so sad on a personal level
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:11.040]  you know baba chatman i want to get your take on what's happening in the
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:16.160]  middle east and what your forecast is we just had this big bombing in indonesia
[2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:19.040]  uh... they're not saying who's responsible yet but uh... i have been
[2:43:19.040 --> 2:43:22.480]  watching the news wires i'm sure they're gonna blame al-qaeda or al-qaeda like
[2:43:22.480 --> 2:43:26.880]  insurgents i do you see an escalation in the activity there you think it's just
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:29.120]  going to kind of taper off into the background
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:34.400]  and we're going to just continue to conduct operations in afghanistan iraq
[2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:38.240]  hard to say and i think it probably would taper off
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:43.440]  and uh... the the problem is not only of the occupation of iraq
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:47.120]  and the continual bombings but also uh... the
[2:43:47.120 --> 2:43:51.920]  service that uh... we are in uh... in afghanistan which i think
[2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:56.560]  i think it stands a very very good chance of going into pakistan
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:01.680]  and uh... and so i i think we're already conducting operations in pakistan let's
[2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:06.160]  talk about that for a minute i mean you can't now hit the news wires for less
[2:44:06.160 --> 2:44:10.000]  than two or three days without finding out that we used a drone attack to kill
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:13.840]  forty fifty or sixty people and always it's always their insurgents
[2:44:13.840 --> 2:44:17.120]  let's let's be real about this they're killing families
[2:44:17.120 --> 2:44:20.640]  they're killing neighborhoods when you're killing forty fifty or sixty people
[2:44:20.640 --> 2:44:24.240]  at a time it's not always an insurgency camp or
[2:44:24.240 --> 2:44:28.400]  al-qaeda center or a tele Taliban terrorist training facility
[2:44:28.400 --> 2:44:32.320]  the majority of the times they're targeting the regular populace and we
[2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:33.440]  had this come out
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:36.560]  i think about a month ago where they were paying quote unquote another
[2:44:36.560 --> 2:44:40.640]  insurgent to take a little microchip small little microchips the size of a
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:44.800]  grain of rice and then throw them into quote unquote other insurgents homes
[2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:49.040]  and then a uh... missile would be guided in by that microchip
[2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:51.840]  and the guy said well and they were paying me a hundred and twenty two
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:54.720]  dollars every time they give me a handful so i was just putting them
[2:44:54.720 --> 2:44:56.800]  anywhere
[2:44:56.800 --> 2:45:02.720]  and and and and and and i i i believe that and uh... this is the kind of thing
[2:45:02.720 --> 2:45:07.280]  that government uses to extend warfare if they want to do so
[2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:12.400]  and uh... they are going to continue in pakistan where else they'll go
[2:45:12.400 --> 2:45:15.240]  uh... iran or north korea or wherever
[2:45:15.240 --> 2:45:17.600]  uh... remains to be seen
[2:45:17.600 --> 2:45:20.280]  one thing you can be assured of is that
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:24.120]  in uh... very very troubled economic and financial times
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:28.680]  history tells us that a war is always begun
[2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:31.520]  a different a bigger war than we already have
[2:45:31.520 --> 2:45:34.240]  and so that's what i think we've got to look forward to
[2:45:34.240 --> 2:45:37.280]  and incidentally i have to mention something i mentioned with ted last
[2:45:37.280 --> 2:45:38.160]  night
[2:45:38.160 --> 2:45:41.200]  on butch paul's uh... program
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:45.600]  and that is i had on drew rain's blog talk uh... show
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:49.920]  i had a uh... carnal who had just come back from afghanistan
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:52.080]  uh... and he said that uh...
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:53.600]  uh... they had four
[2:45:53.600 --> 2:45:56.640]  british solvents sewn into the uniform
[2:45:56.640 --> 2:46:00.400]  and uh... he had to bail out of his plane
[2:46:00.400 --> 2:46:03.320]  and uh... when he hit the ground
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:04.640]  and uh...
[2:46:04.640 --> 2:46:06.240]  pulled in his parachute
[2:46:06.240 --> 2:46:08.800]  low and behold it was some locals there
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:12.160]  and he took out a sovereign and handed to them
[2:46:12.160 --> 2:46:15.240]  and they took him to some camel herders
[2:46:15.240 --> 2:46:19.640]  uh... who when he met them he gave them a sovereign and they all smiled and
[2:46:19.640 --> 2:46:21.280]  took him to a village
[2:46:21.280 --> 2:46:25.480]  and in the village he gave him a sovereign and they took him to his unit
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:27.840]  and so the moral of the story is
[2:46:27.840 --> 2:46:31.320]  he who has the gold makes the rules
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:35.840]  now absolutely and that is again a currency that transcends uh... you know
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:37.320]  destinations places
[2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:39.760]  actual regions i mean gold and silver
[2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:43.880]  or silver are read are not regional currencies they are universal currencies
[2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:46.640]  they have been used since the beginning of time
[2:46:46.640 --> 2:46:48.360]  well civilized time anyway
[2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:51.640]  and they've retained their value how can people get gold and silver right now

[2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:41.320]  uh... my point is basically about the face book thing
[2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:43.360]  uh... in the u k in the u k
[2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:46.960]  uh... obviously if you have seen that then in the day of my life all that
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:50.480]  uh... now my my my question is basically uh...
[2:47:50.480 --> 2:47:52.440]  if it's face book safe anymore
[2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:54.960]  because obviously that they obviously found out that was a great in this
[2:47:54.960 --> 2:47:55.720]  party
[2:47:55.720 --> 2:47:56.800]  well let me tell you that
[2:47:56.800 --> 2:47:59.960]  two years ago i captured something uh... that i'm going to be using an
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:03.240]  invisible empire and want to do this new world order picture for quite some
[2:48:03.240 --> 2:48:06.040]  time really working on it working on a hard finalize the first third of my
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:07.440]  script but two years ago
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:10.920]  i was watching uh... g four tv which is like kind of like this
[2:48:10.920 --> 2:48:14.400]  uh... techie kind of station for people that are in the video games and pop
[2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:16.520]  culture and whatever it's big with the younger kids
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:21.040]  and all of a sudden i see how the f b i is now going to be patrolling my space
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:24.840]  and this was right before rupert murdoch bought on and all this other stuff
[2:48:24.840 --> 2:48:26.040]  they're like they're gonna start
[2:48:26.040 --> 2:48:28.680]  creating fake profiles and suckering people in
[2:48:28.680 --> 2:48:30.120]  then recently
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:32.480]  i saw them announced the same thing with face book
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:36.040]  and then like i said two months ago i saw that they busted a new jersey uh...
[2:48:36.040 --> 2:48:40.040]  post prom party where kids were going to be drinking the evil alcohol
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:43.560]  after graduating from high school how dare they have a right of passage
[2:48:43.560 --> 2:48:48.640]  and their post prom party was actually rated by the police so is it safe nothing
[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:52.120]  you do is safe on the internet just like i told you before all the major
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:56.760]  telecommunication companies by federal law are forced to have a separate room
[2:48:56.760 --> 2:49:00.200]  where everything you do on your cell phone and everything you do on the
[2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:04.360]  internet is then track traced and database put into another hard drive
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:07.840]  system it then runs through software this again doesn't mean people are
[2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:11.560]  actually looking at you yet but then you are profiled and through these profiles
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:15.760]  they set up actual human units and they start to serve value that's why you see
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:19.320]  these fusion dissenter documents in the united states where they say oh yeah we
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:21.880]  are targeting people anti-illegal immigration
[2:49:21.880 --> 2:49:25.640]  oh yeah we are targeting people who are anti-technology we are targeting
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:26.520]  people that are
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:28.840]  one uh... what is it up
[2:49:28.840 --> 2:49:32.840]  uh... one agenda now it's it's it's it's one it's ridiculous basically if you
[2:49:32.840 --> 2:49:35.240]  protest anything anytime anywhere
[2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:37.840]  yeah you are an extremist and possibly
[2:49:37.840 --> 2:49:39.000]  a al-qaeda
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:43.440]  insurgent so is it safe it's safe if you know how to use it if you know how much
[2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:44.880]  information about you
[2:49:44.880 --> 2:49:46.120]  you want to give out there
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:49.480]  i mean just by going to my myspace page you can figure out who my
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:52.640]  brother is my sister you can see a picture of my knees
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:56.000]  contract my family you can see what friends i have you can check their
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.760]  comments page and see what we've relayed back and forth
[2:49:58.760 --> 2:50:01.760]  i mean you are really are setting yourself for an open source
[2:50:01.760 --> 2:50:03.400]  information bonanza
[2:50:03.400 --> 2:50:06.920]  but it's up to you to decide how much big brother gets to know
[2:50:06.920 --> 2:50:09.600]  i mean you don't get that decision when you're just searching the internet and
[2:50:09.600 --> 2:50:11.880]  they have your ip address i hope that helps matt

[2:54:26.320 --> 2:54:29.760]  and a lot of people miss this i hadn't seen any articles on it and i haven't
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:33.520]  seen the video on youtube kind of hard to find we have a take it off c span but
[2:54:33.520 --> 2:54:36.920]  in uh... nancy polosi's weekly address
[2:54:36.920 --> 2:54:37.800]  she was asked
[2:54:37.800 --> 2:54:39.680]  about hr twelve oh seven
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:43.160]  and auditing the federal reserve now how does she respond well she responds by
[2:54:43.160 --> 2:54:43.840]  saying
[2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:45.560]  well it sounds to me
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:49.200]  alike the people want to know more secrets to the temple and then she kind of
[2:54:49.200 --> 2:54:53.120]  chuckles to herself and says how secrets to the temple it was required reading in
[2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:57.400]  my day and she babbles on for about two minutes avoiding the question she tries
[2:54:57.400 --> 2:54:58.920]  to go to another person
[2:54:58.920 --> 2:55:01.880]  she then gets asked well what's your position on the bill
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:04.360]  and then she claims uh... mister chappan
[2:55:04.360 --> 2:55:09.360]  that she doesn't know the specifics and she can't give a response
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:12.280]  as a head of the house of representatives
[2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:17.080]  she's either a bull face liar or she's a moron
[2:55:17.080 --> 2:55:20.400]  and maybe a little bit of both yeah i don't know what she's not a moron she's
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:22.200]  very cunning she's very smart
[2:55:22.200 --> 2:55:25.320]  she's actually sixty nine years old which i didn't realize she looks pretty
[2:55:25.320 --> 2:55:28.840]  good for a sixty nine-year-old it's the multiple facelifts it must be the
[2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:30.480]  multiple facelifts
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:34.160]  my contention is is this is a woman who is very politically savvy
[2:55:34.160 --> 2:55:38.560]  uh... almost preditorial she's somebody who was the lead uh... democrat in the
[2:55:38.560 --> 2:55:42.520]  initial congressional investigation into nine eleven she's the person that
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:45.880]  brought us know we're not going to bring the bush administration up on war
[2:55:45.880 --> 2:55:46.920]  crimes and no
[2:55:46.920 --> 2:55:48.600]  impeachment is off
[2:55:48.600 --> 2:55:52.520]  the table so to me this is this woman is a political player who wants to get as
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:56.520]  high in the ranks as she possibly can on behalf of her masters in the elite
[2:55:56.520 --> 2:55:58.680]  ruling class
[2:55:58.680 --> 2:55:59.960]  exactly
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:03.680]  i mean i i don't think you're going to end you know she's keeping it captive in
[2:56:03.680 --> 2:56:06.000]  there for as long as i can
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:10.160]  because she doesn't want to get out uh... out out out into the full devotee
[2:56:10.160 --> 2:56:12.480]  to the past
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:15.000]  her masters are telling it to do that
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:18.680]  and you have that uh... retro bit barney frank who is the head of the
[2:56:18.680 --> 2:56:20.920]  committee who's holding it in there
[2:56:20.920 --> 2:56:23.520]  and uh... he's a disgusting creature
[2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:26.200]  he is a disgusting creature and he will be exposed
[2:56:26.200 --> 2:56:30.080]  in invisible empire in ways people have no idea to see the clips i have their
[2:56:30.080 --> 2:56:32.560]  own man i can't wait
[2:56:32.560 --> 2:56:35.640]  if i didn't have to run to the bank after the show you gotta see these things i
[2:56:35.640 --> 2:56:38.440]  mean i've got them back over i don't know about the year out in the nineties
[2:56:38.440 --> 2:56:39.800]  where he's openly
[2:56:39.800 --> 2:56:43.000]  tell another congressman to shut their mouths about the uh... underage
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:46.600]  prostitution ring he's running in his dc home apartment yeah and then all of a
[2:56:46.600 --> 2:56:50.600]  sudden it's just slap on the wrist on not a democrat anymore republican or no
[2:56:50.600 --> 2:56:53.800]  not a republican anymore i'm a democrat i don't want to i don't want to be like
[2:56:53.800 --> 2:56:57.400]  you know debbie downer here but if they did if they did pass this this bill the
[2:56:57.400 --> 2:57:00.520]  audits federal reserve i mean wouldn't the powers that be just assigned a whole
[2:57:00.520 --> 2:57:04.080]  bunch of cfr members to look into it like they do all the time anyway what's
[2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:06.080]  your take on that mr chad
[2:57:06.080 --> 2:57:09.480]  that's possible but i think you're gonna get a human cry
[2:57:09.480 --> 2:57:12.280]  uh... you know people want action
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:17.560]  and uh... and they're not getting it and uh... it's time to start hauling
[2:57:17.560 --> 2:57:21.320]  uh... about that fact that they're not uh... being recognized or any of the
[2:57:21.320 --> 2:57:23.720]  things that they want to be looked into
[2:57:23.720 --> 2:57:26.840]  well at the very least i think that we want this hearing on the floor
[2:57:26.840 --> 2:57:30.760]  so you know people like us in the alternative media can at least tape that
[2:57:30.760 --> 2:57:33.720]  and then put it into a film and let millions and millions and millions of
[2:57:33.720 --> 2:57:37.640]  people see what actually happened and was kept away from them by both the
[2:57:37.640 --> 2:57:42.240]  government and the mainstream media and having a pet impact that way
[2:57:42.240 --> 2:57:44.600]  that's true and they're well aware of that
[2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:49.000]  and uh... you know uh... we've we've got half the people in america now looking
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:50.880]  at the alternative media
[2:57:50.880 --> 2:57:53.840]  and as you've seen from the drop in advertising
[2:57:53.840 --> 2:57:56.840]  and the terrible problems the media is having both
[2:57:56.840 --> 2:58:00.040]  uh... print as well as the radio and tv
[2:58:00.040 --> 2:58:05.080]  uh... we're gaining ground every single day on them
[2:58:05.080 --> 2:58:09.000]  and because we're spewing out the truth and really that's what the people want
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:12.760]  there are people who don't want the truth because they just don't want to face it
[2:58:12.760 --> 2:58:15.880]  and that's probably happy population but if we can get half the people i
[2:58:15.880 --> 2:58:17.320]  understand what's going on
[2:58:17.320 --> 2:58:19.640]  we can be bring some fierce heat on them
[2:58:19.640 --> 2:58:23.240]  if we can get a quarter of the people to understand what's going on and then take
[2:58:23.240 --> 2:58:28.120]  action after that we've got a real shot at winning alex jones coming up
[2:58:28.120 --> 2:58:31.800]  in the next segment i'm jason bermas sitting in thank you bob daisy thank you

[2:58:59.120 --> 2:59:03.680]  major environmental auditor they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants
[2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:07.280]  are present in municipal drinking water many of these chemicals are directly
[2:59:07.280 --> 2:59:11.200]  linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental system diseases
[2:59:11.200 --> 2:59:14.960]  now what are you going to do about it the acola blue atmospheric water

[3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:57.040]  breakdown some basics on eugenics and vampiric robots
[3:00:57.040 --> 3:01:02.880]  yes you heard me right vampiric robots vampire robots
[3:01:02.880 --> 3:01:07.600]  look truth stranger than fiction it's ap it's roiders it's fox news
[3:01:07.600 --> 3:01:11.120]  they got to fund themselves on your dead bodies that's how they that's how they
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:16.000]  feed zombie robots i can't handle it god
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:19.440]  these people were fighting are so psychopathic so evil
[3:01:19.440 --> 3:01:22.640]  they invent new evils every day i mean i would never have thought of that
[3:01:22.640 --> 3:01:26.880]  they fund themselves on our dead bodies but actually that is the matrix
[3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:31.680]  and the army report from 68 declassified in january of 2000
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:34.880]  which they then admitted that the wachowski brothers had seen parts of
[3:01:34.880 --> 3:01:39.680]  before it was declassified they i guess the army did say we would be batteries
[3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:43.440]  in hive tanks and since perception is reality
[3:01:43.440 --> 3:01:46.400]  we would all be hooked into these group hive tanks
[3:01:46.400 --> 3:01:49.360]  and then our own body heat would run the computers
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:54.720]  that would give us rapture like happiness philip k dick
[3:01:54.720 --> 3:01:57.680]  you know got raided and had a safe blown open by the feds
[3:01:57.680 --> 3:02:01.280]  because when he wrote about all that the feds flipped out in the 70s
[3:02:01.280 --> 3:02:05.280]  and thought he'd been given classified info i've talked to
[3:02:05.280 --> 3:02:08.160]  folks very close to the dick estate i'll just leave it at that i have a video
[3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:12.320]  clip tommy pilotta was telling me about that a few years ago about talking to
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:17.120]  dick's daughters and about some of the feds and things
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:20.480]  and why they raided him but but but now we know why because so much of what dick's
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:24.560]  books were about he had just envisioned i'm almost
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:28.160]  psychically many believe and then that's actually what their program was
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:31.760]  but regardless the government plans to put us all in tanks
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:35.760]  that's full spectrum dominance you see those tanks and matrix that's a pentagon
[3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:39.120]  full spectrum dominance plan because no one can resist them worldwide if we're
[3:02:39.120 --> 3:02:42.560]  all in tanks including the military hey i know
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:45.680]  you feel like you just fell into the twilight zone i'm only covering what
[3:02:45.680 --> 3:02:48.400]  they're saying they're gonna do i mean i'm not even saying they'll get away
[3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:51.520]  with it these people are nuts i mean when i read fox news headline
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:55.280]  robots to feed off human flesh attack killer robots
[3:02:55.280 --> 3:02:58.480]  uh i guess i hadn't seen that government documents before
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:01.520]  i was thinking that's something entirely new i guess it's not it's just
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:06.000]  instead of keeping you in a tank and your body heat feeding them uh they're
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:09.600]  just gonna kill you and then feed on your flesh
[3:03:09.600 --> 3:03:14.160]  and it's got a little bio converter that does that
[3:03:14.160 --> 3:03:18.960]  you gotta admit that's a very liberal thing that's uh
[3:03:18.960 --> 3:03:23.680]  it's like david rosschild has a boat he sails around the world on
[3:03:23.680 --> 3:03:30.000]  that that's powered by human waste and he's very proud on on tv as he uh
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:33.520]  gets up on the toilet and rags how he's doing it see it's all about how we're
[3:03:33.520 --> 3:03:36.160]  going to eat ourselves soylent green is made out of people
[3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:39.200]  but they're going to artificially shut off the resources to where we're
[3:03:39.200 --> 3:03:43.920]  basically forced into that type situation shutting
[3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:49.360]  down the resources
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:54.720]  so we will uh take your calls on these subjects
[3:03:54.720 --> 3:03:59.520]  and a lot more coming up in fact you know i just had this idea to get back into
[3:03:59.520 --> 3:04:02.640]  eugenics and there's so many facets you guys print me the
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:07.040]  story that paul wrote about obama's uh science are
[3:04:07.040 --> 3:04:09.920]  wants to plan to sterilize people with the water
[3:04:09.920 --> 3:04:14.400]  already happening i think that's kind of an important article
[3:04:14.400 --> 3:04:17.280]  you know major universities are finding that there's higher levels of
[3:04:17.280 --> 3:04:21.680]  hormones in the water than even should be from runoff
[3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:25.360]  water coming out of aquifers in major cities that isn't involved in runoff
[3:04:25.360 --> 3:04:33.440]  as it added it's for your own good to save the earth
[3:04:33.440 --> 3:04:38.320]  you like living in a petri dish you like the egghead chicken necks running

[3:04:51.280 --> 3:04:56.080]  you and your family die they've got the power now

[3:09:25.040 --> 3:09:29.680]  scientific thought of the western world a hundred years ago or 70 years ago or
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:36.560]  even 50 years ago it is hyper dominant

[3:09:52.320 --> 3:09:56.640]  detailed out there since we began covering this over the weekend world
[3:09:56.640 --> 3:09:59.840]  net daily and even some mainstream newspapers
[3:09:59.840 --> 3:10:02.240]  have picked up on the story fox news has covered it
[3:10:02.240 --> 3:10:08.240]  so have some other national cable tv news networks
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:13.360]  obama's science advisor called for planetary regime
[3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:18.480]  to enforce the planetary and population control measures
[3:10:18.480 --> 3:10:22.320]  and this is john holdren the science czar
[3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:26.240]  over roughly 90 percent of technological and scientific development
[3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:30.240]  in the united states and that's really an old number with the feds taking over
[3:10:30.240 --> 3:10:35.680]  chrysler and gm it's even more but right at 90 percent of technological
[3:10:35.680 --> 3:10:38.640]  research at universities and private institutions
[3:10:38.640 --> 3:10:45.760]  is federally funded taxpayer money and he wrote a policy book he's also been
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:49.440]  the head of technology for harvard and other institutions he also was a high
[3:10:49.440 --> 3:10:52.640]  level at mit at the time of writing the book
[3:10:52.640 --> 3:10:56.080]  and he wrote it with one of george bush's top science
[3:10:56.080 --> 3:11:02.720]  advisors and the book is up on prison planet dot com we have much of it scanned
[3:11:02.720 --> 3:11:08.080]  in and the book is eco science population resources
[3:11:08.080 --> 3:11:14.400]  and environment paul r ehrlich one of george bush's top advisors
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:22.240]  co-wrote it with his wife and h ehrlich and with obama's chief
[3:11:22.240 --> 3:11:29.200]  science advisor john p holdren now
[3:11:29.200 --> 3:11:33.520]  every claim we make in this detailed 18 page article
[3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:40.720]  is documented by scans of the pages that are up on the site
[3:11:40.720 --> 3:11:46.320]  and every claim we make every quote we read we have his actual book
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:50.800]  now that said i'm all about shattering a left-right paradigm
[3:11:50.800 --> 3:11:54.400]  i'm all about getting past the fact that big
[3:11:54.400 --> 3:11:58.240]  offshore banks control both parties
[3:11:58.880 --> 3:12:02.240]  so getting past liberal and conservative debates and realizing that
[3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:07.360]  both parties are bought and paid for by offshore interest now
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:10.720]  and perhaps you should link to this story paul watson's got it up on prison
[3:12:10.720 --> 3:12:14.560]  planet dot com he wrote a story about supposed left-wing website
[3:12:14.560 --> 3:12:20.800]  newshounds attacked us that it was all a right-wing made up figment of our imagination
[3:12:20.800 --> 3:12:25.520]  that we have no proof and then linked to prison planet dot com and called us black helicopter cooks
[3:12:28.720 --> 3:12:33.200]  now this is an example of mind control do the folks over at these
[3:12:33.200 --> 3:12:37.360]  liberal sites not just newshounds that are attacking us do they really believe
[3:12:37.360 --> 3:12:43.840]  what they're saying i mean we scan the book we have the book
[3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:47.200]  we're nonpartisan we're known for being nonpartisan i
[3:12:47.200 --> 3:12:50.800]  cut my teeth going after clinton as a globalist and for george w bush and
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:56.000]  after barack h obama these guys are just puppets we spend
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:59.760]  all day every day explaining they're just frontmen who read off teleprompters
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:05.760]  and we explain how you've always got to make it left-wing or right-wing the
[3:13:05.760 --> 3:13:08.800]  right-wing when they're out of power gets to blame the whole system on the left
[3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:11.520]  and when the left side of power they blame it on the right wing when
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:15.200]  both parties are two wings on the same bird of prey known as the globalist the
[3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:21.600]  scientific dictatorship so there's this issue of denial
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:25.360]  now
[3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:39.520]  john p holdren is obama's appointee but congress and george w bush in the last
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:45.920]  eight years had his co-author as one of their chief advisors and we
[3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:49.280]  said that in the article we've said that in our other articles
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:52.800]  we wrote another article yesterday with his own quotes and this is
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:58.880]  a policy report to academia and government a textbook a plan a program
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:02.800]  that we see mirrored in united nations biological diversity assessment
[3:14:02.800 --> 3:14:09.440]  passes unlaw 1996 state apartment random 200 cia memorandum 200
[3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:18.480]  declassified 92 made us official policy of the executive in 1973 i just sourced
[3:14:18.480 --> 3:14:24.720]  it for you saying they use war famine sterilization all of this to reduce
[3:14:24.720 --> 3:14:28.720]  world's population i mean whether you're for this or against it you should know
[3:14:28.720 --> 3:14:29.760]  this is going on
[3:14:29.760 --> 3:14:34.160]  i mean i keep going back to this article
[3:14:35.440 --> 3:14:38.640]  their scores of these and i played you the abc news clip a few days ago
[3:14:38.640 --> 3:14:42.320]  where they said oh the world's elite warren buffett and ted turner
[3:14:42.960 --> 3:14:47.600]  and bill gates and they've given over 130 something billion they all met in a secret
[3:14:49.920 --> 3:14:53.520]  and they discussed how they want to help the poor and then the group actually
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:14:58.480]  rockefeller university that ran the meeting actually gave an interview to the
[3:14:58.480 --> 3:15:01.600]  times of london said oh no it was about how to reduce population there's the
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:05.520]  headline billionaire club in bid to curb over population so us media just said
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:08.960]  oh it's the good group that's the name they call it the good group not the
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:12.320]  bilgerberg group not the cfr not a bilgerberg group steering meeting which
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:19.200]  it really was it's the good group so billionaire club in bid to curb over
[3:15:19.200 --> 3:15:20.000]  population
[3:15:22.960 --> 3:15:26.560]  and they go over the world government how world governments needed to carry this
[3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:30.000]  out i mean this is one of the biggest newspapers in the world the times of
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:32.880]  london is in the top three biggest newspapers in the world
[3:15:34.400 --> 3:15:38.080]  you can debate whether it's new york times times of london and london guardian
[3:15:38.080 --> 3:15:43.920]  who is the biggest but it's one of those three i mean this newspaper exists i want
[3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:51.280]  new sounds and others attacking me to to to know i mean i'm giving you holdren's book
[3:15:51.280 --> 3:15:56.160]  i've given you the scans i've given you the quotes and what page they're on and posted
[3:15:56.160 --> 3:15:59.280]  the page for you and you just say i'm lying and making it up
[3:16:01.920 --> 3:16:06.720]  do you really believe the lies you're telling or are are you delusional
[3:16:08.640 --> 3:16:12.080]  i mean is it fun to call me a tinfoil hat wearing black helicopter pilot
[3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:22.320]  i mean i remember making in game two years ago interviewing the the heir of the ross
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:27.120]  shalt fortune and i said your carbon taxes attacks you're planning to do home inspections
[3:16:27.120 --> 3:16:31.520]  tax everything we do that's in the un documents and he said no it's not it's not a tax you're a liar
[3:16:33.120 --> 3:16:37.280]  but i said sir you all know it's a tax now
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:44.240]  i mean we can't live in this denial saying this doesn't exist
[3:16:46.560 --> 3:16:51.760]  doesn't stop it from being real perception is not reality you can be wearing a virtual
[3:16:51.760 --> 3:16:57.440]  reality helmet that shows that you're walking on clouds and that there's bluebirds flying past you
[3:16:57.440 --> 3:17:03.200]  and and angels playing hearts but if you walk off a 500 foot cliff and fall onto spikes below
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:08.720]  you're gonna die you can be wearing the virtual reality headset and that's what this mainstream
[3:17:08.720 --> 3:17:15.520]  media and all this culture is is a false projection of what reality is that sedan has
[3:17:15.520 --> 3:17:22.800]  wmd's and that 19 hijackers from a cave made norad stand down and carried out 9 11 and magic
[3:17:22.800 --> 3:17:29.920]  passports in shanksville pennsylvania and in new york fell from the sky unburned and were found
[3:17:32.560 --> 3:17:42.480]  that's false reality that mercury is good for you is false reality i have cbs news i have msnbc
[3:17:42.480 --> 3:17:49.040]  saying mercury and lead are now vitamins for your children i mean that's money python humor it sounds
[3:17:49.040 --> 3:17:56.320]  like of some nightmare crazy future but it's not i have these newscast scores of them we've played
[3:17:56.320 --> 3:18:01.840]  them many times in fact i might even get to them later i want to i do want to play a short clip
[3:18:01.840 --> 3:18:08.720]  though of msnbc with bayer pharmaceutical knowingly shipping out over a million injections of factor
[3:18:08.720 --> 3:18:13.200]  eight blood drug knowing all of the shots at hiv and hepatitis in them and would kill everybody
[3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:17.840]  that took it and their own documents came out in court cases that they knew it and did it not
[3:18:17.840 --> 3:18:23.600]  because they wanted money it was because they wanted to kill hemophiliacs bayer is a nazi company
[3:18:27.040 --> 3:18:33.200]  so is ig pharbon i assure you world war two existed i assure you hitler existed i assure
[3:18:33.200 --> 3:18:37.360]  newshounds that this isn't a joke you know people always make fun of the germans who didn't believe
[3:18:37.360 --> 3:18:43.280]  that hitler had death camps and that's why the generals made the germans pilot the dead bodies
[3:18:43.280 --> 3:18:48.720]  themselves and burn them the local towns folks who were in denial i i i believe that they didn't
[3:18:48.720 --> 3:18:55.760]  think it was going on i mean cps here in austin kidnaps hundreds of children every week and take
[3:18:55.760 --> 3:19:00.160]  some facilities where they admittedly rape them and they're five or seven times more likely to be
[3:19:00.160 --> 3:19:04.320]  abused and it comes out in the news all over the country pedophiles run these facilities and no one
[3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:10.320]  gets in trouble and then the general public's in denial about that i mean you've got rape camps
[3:19:11.360 --> 3:19:15.600]  i mean half the prisons around austin have been shut down and new companies have gotten the contracts
[3:19:15.600 --> 3:19:19.600]  because they they they film porno movies raping the kids and women at them
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:26.720]  there'll be a blurb in the newspaper about it i mean we're living in the middle of a nightmare
[3:19:26.720 --> 3:19:32.880]  but it's been incrementally kind of a background noise of tyranny and death and genocide and soft
[3:19:32.880 --> 3:19:41.280]  kill weapons slowly being turned up to now it's at a just a huge bellowing cacophony of sound
[3:19:43.600 --> 3:19:51.280]  and corruption and murder and tyranny and people can't even hear the tyranny it's so loud

[3:24:30.320 --> 3:24:35.360]  rugging your food your water putting poisons and toxins in the air by design as holgren's
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:41.040]  now in the apn roiders by the way we finally found a video of him at that science conference
[3:24:41.920 --> 3:24:47.040]  no one had it i was up until one in the morning and the guys were breathing later so they're
[3:24:47.040 --> 3:24:51.120]  not here the minute that watson and erin come in are they in yet

[3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:24.160]  cause all these degenerative brain diseases like all timers i now have the video of him at the press
[3:25:24.160 --> 3:25:34.000]  conference it's just totally insane all of it is just totally insane it's all off the charts um
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:42.000]  okay let me just go over the basic facts here the mindsets of these people some of the documents
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:47.120]  you want to read are state department random 200 united nations biological diversity assessment
[3:25:47.120 --> 3:25:56.880]  90 1996 uh books written by people like holgren ecoscience population resources and environment
[3:25:57.440 --> 3:26:05.120]  if i was an animal written by his royal highness the duke of edinburgh uh books written by jaquist
[3:26:05.120 --> 3:26:09.280]  stowe books written by ted turner statements by ted turner saying kill 80 percent of the
[3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:16.320]  usals feeders uh statements by hitler i also put into the record mine comp or my struggle
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:22.720]  by adolf a lowest hitler he talks about it all there and thanks american eugenicist
[3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:29.440]  and listen by name saying that their books are his bible and that he hails the united
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:37.680]  states his true source of uh encouragement we get all the credit and i just want to tell news
[3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:42.960]  hounds and others attacking me hitler existed even if you say he didn't what hitler did existed
[3:26:43.840 --> 3:26:51.040]  and giggling yuppie smirking about this doesn't change it okay there's just a few of the sources
[3:26:51.760 --> 3:26:58.000]  paul watson's 18 page report also the other report obama science are planned to sterilize
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:03.440]  population through water supply already happening we'll put that up on screen for you as well
[3:27:03.440 --> 3:27:11.040]  uh here at present planet dot tv here are some of the notes i wrote before i went on air just
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:18.160]  just areas i want to discuss dealing with this history the flu the force flu shots how that
[3:27:18.160 --> 3:27:24.080]  ties into that how we're under a microscope how we're basically lab rats in this controlled
[3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:28.080]  engineered society under the globalist control how it's a scientific dictatorship
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:35.120]  yupp some of the top global planners that have been openly talking about killing the majority
[3:27:35.120 --> 3:27:40.240]  of us that have gotten attention how this is so horrible people have trouble facing it and dealing
[3:27:40.240 --> 3:27:47.760]  with it and the mindset of the elites and how in their own internal documents this is nothing
[3:27:47.760 --> 3:27:52.240]  to do with the environment the earth they want a manageable group of people to deal with and it's
[3:27:52.240 --> 3:27:57.200]  all part of being the priest of power deciding who lives and who dies and exterminating the majority
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:01.600]  of the world population including the most intelligent unless you're part of the elite
[3:28:01.600 --> 3:28:08.400]  families you are dead you were to be hunted down and killed so we will go through all this in the
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:19.680]  long segment coming up but i do want to direct everybody to the quotes of john p holdren in
[3:28:19.680 --> 3:28:26.640]  his government textbook forcibly and unknowingly sterilizing the entire population batting infertility
[3:28:26.640 --> 3:28:33.280]  drugs legalizing compulsory abortions i e forced abortions carried out against the will of the
[3:28:33.280 --> 3:28:38.560]  pregnant women as is commonplace in communist china which is funded by the u s to do this
[3:28:38.560 --> 3:28:45.040]  where women who have already had one child and refused to abort the second or kidnapped
[3:28:45.040 --> 3:28:49.440]  off the street by the authorities before a procedure is carried out to forcibly abort the
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:54.720]  baby the babies are then many times actually kept alive and sold for medical experiments then killed
[3:28:54.720 --> 3:28:58.320]  people worry about them killing monkeys and apes hell they're they got babies baby
[3:28:59.680 --> 3:29:04.480]  remember hitler also thanks in his speeches and books in mind comp the united states for the
[3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:09.360]  concentration camp plan adopted from the british of putting people in camps and starving them to
[3:29:09.360 --> 3:29:14.800]  death and using bio weapon attacks holdren's also part of the pug wash society set up by
[3:29:14.800 --> 3:29:22.160]  nobel prize-winning eugenicist barter and russell where he says we we can't nuke countries when they
[3:29:22.160 --> 3:29:26.640]  hit us with bio weapons because the bio attacks will actually be good to reduce our numbers
[3:29:26.640 --> 3:29:30.880]  because they're planning to release bio weapons claim a third world country did it and they don't
[3:29:30.880 --> 3:29:35.040]  want to have a nuclear war that might actually hurt the elite so they're getting you ready for
[3:29:35.040 --> 3:29:39.920]  your death and dr peonka i have him here in the quotes when he got questioned about wanting to kill

[3:33:00.240 --> 3:33:12.720]  today monday through friday from 11 a.m to 3 p.m central standard time we're here live
[3:33:13.840 --> 3:33:16.160]  all right let me continue getting to the news
[3:33:18.320 --> 3:33:22.000]  eugenics and i'm gonna get into more of the scientific angles of it and their larger plans
[3:33:22.000 --> 3:33:29.280]  are in a moment but eugenics is also about propagandizing the public to hate themselves
[3:33:29.280 --> 3:33:34.400]  to think that the development is bad private property is bad under eugenics the family is
[3:33:34.400 --> 3:33:39.760]  bad because you owe allegiance to your family you'll stand up for your family not to the state
[3:33:40.480 --> 3:33:45.600]  and we posted scores of textbook links and articles where they say the family's a disease the
[3:33:45.600 --> 3:33:50.800]  family's got to be eradicated all families are mentally ill and you look at the communist chinese
[3:33:50.800 --> 3:33:55.200]  model where they're basically eradicating the family here's just the last few days
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:34:00.240]  without even looking where they're demonizing the family does having children make you unhappy
[3:34:01.760 --> 3:34:09.760]  this is out of the new york times and it says children are basically bad when you read the
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:15.760]  article it quotes the journal of british psychological association saying the family is
[3:34:15.760 --> 3:34:22.320]  basically not good and is terrible now i randomly just picked up an Atlantic monthly last weekend
[3:34:22.880 --> 3:34:27.600]  half the magazine is global warming tax propaganda and world government tax propaganda we covered
[3:34:27.600 --> 3:34:35.600]  that a few days ago but on page 116 let's call the whole thing off this author is ending her
[3:34:35.600 --> 3:34:43.520]  marriage it isn't isn't it time you did the same and it says marriage is bad and sucks and family's
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:51.360]  bad i mean these people are sick so they always wanted to tear down family they want to get you
[3:34:51.360 --> 3:34:57.280]  cornered by yourself so when they euthanize your butt nobody's there to stand up for you
[3:34:58.160 --> 3:35:04.080]  okay and then look half the pages here's an oil company supporting global greenhouse taxes
[3:35:04.080 --> 3:35:10.480]  dutch royal shell and i mean it's literally half the magazine it is just unspeakable propaganda
[3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:16.000]  and then they've got an article in here about how they want to chem trail the public and who is
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:29.280]  proposing that obama's climate czar is taking his orders from mr. holdren john p. holdren the guy
[3:35:29.280 --> 3:35:34.000]  calling for the eugenics and by the way people say oh well he wrote that textbook a long time ago
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:38.080]  calling for exterminating the majority of the population sterilizing everybody he wrote that
[3:35:38.080 --> 3:35:44.320]  a long time ago here he is in a mainstream news interview with displaying the book in his office
[3:35:44.320 --> 3:35:56.640]  proudly eco science on the wall right there there's the book it's just so sick and again here's the
[3:35:56.640 --> 3:36:02.720]  wall street journal saying terraform things and who's the guy that says this him holdren holdren
[3:36:02.720 --> 3:36:10.960]  is now saying oh we're going to spray aluminum dioxide on you to manipulate the weather to
[3:36:10.960 --> 3:36:14.800]  save the earth and then all these scientists go wait a minute that causes brain damage and then
[3:36:14.800 --> 3:36:22.480]  by the way they're already been doing this program for decades and then same article in here it's
[3:36:22.480 --> 3:36:28.160]  just everywhere we are swimming in it don't have kids don't have a family family's bad go out and
[3:36:28.160 --> 3:36:40.480]  party take drugs have a good time now look at this article this is out of fox news what does this
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:46.240]  have to do with eugenics i'm going to explain it all to you in a moment it is the key upcoming
[3:36:46.240 --> 3:36:54.480]  military robot could feed on dead bodies shouldn't the headline be vampire robot to to power itself
[3:36:54.480 --> 3:37:06.560]  on human flesh enter genetically autonomous tactical robot or the eater what a nice name the
[3:37:06.560 --> 3:37:12.640]  eater can make a nice harm movie called eaters with the robots that you'll feed off human flesh
[3:37:13.280 --> 3:37:20.640]  that's fox news it's also in the associated press what does that have to do with this little
[3:37:20.640 --> 3:37:29.520]  article out of the bbc foot and mouth vile went missing oh that's a photo of thousands of dead
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:39.120]  cows burning in apocalyptic fashion with their legs sticking up in the flames smoking what does
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:48.480]  that have to do with the headlines today about how they're preparing for forced inoculations
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:52.160]  of the american people and the british people and this doesn't mean they'll get away with it but
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:58.560]  they're on a bc news fox singing and we've played the clubs saying forced compulsory injections are
[3:37:58.560 --> 3:38:08.000]  coming it's all this tie together with eugenics well i was reading to you holdren obama science
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:12.560]  advisor called for planetary regime to enforce the totalitarian population control measures
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:17.360]  babies who were born out of wedlock or teenage mothers to be forcibly taken away from their
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:22.480]  mother of the government put it up for adoption another purport purported measure would force
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:26.080]  single mothers to demonstrate to the government that they can care for their child effectively
[3:38:26.080 --> 3:38:30.880]  introducing licensing to have children a calls for licensing of children actually in here and
[3:38:30.880 --> 3:38:35.120]  they talk about hunting down of course they're already hunting down christian families and

[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:50.080]  permanently sterilizing people who the authorities deemed who have been to have too many children
[3:38:50.720 --> 3:38:55.840]  formerly passing a law that criminalizes having more than two children similar to the one child
[3:38:55.840 --> 3:38:59.840]  policy in communist china they already demonize on the news families that have more than one kid
[3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:06.400]  in fact i have the newscast on fox news saying having one more than one kid's bad for the earth

[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:36.000]  to the environment they're not putting taxes on toxic waste being dumped in the ocean
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:41.920]  they're not putting no no no this is a tax on what you exhale brother and their own government

[3:41:41.920 --> 3:41:53.760]  half the indigenous britains have a 1.1 population replacement rate england overall has a 1.4 for
[3:41:54.480 --> 3:42:00.560]  every mommy and daddy they have 1.4 kids and that's counting the hundreds of thousands of legal and
[3:42:00.560 --> 3:42:07.520]  illegal aliens brought in yearly that are now counted as domestic births england is now approaching
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:12.400]  total collapse you know what happens when you only start having one child for every parent
[3:42:12.400 --> 3:42:16.640]  within a generation your population is cut in half and then it's almost impossible to start
[3:42:16.640 --> 3:42:24.400]  breeding back to the last levels the eugenicists nazis are actually targeting anglo saxons and
[3:42:24.400 --> 3:42:31.360]  germanic tribes and also jews they always pay to kill jews for some reason the us paid israel to
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:37.920]  radiate 110 000 sephardic jews the brown jews so you have to understand this eugenic society
[3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:44.400]  is jews involved nazis involved the chinese publicly signed treaties to carry out the

[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:33.040]  and as people will sell their own soul oh but again we shouldn't be talking about all this here
[3:43:34.160 --> 3:43:41.040]  we should be talking about michael jackson how that's important see folks
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:48.960]  their propaganda is everywhere their eugenics propaganda they're now selling us and they're
[3:43:48.960 --> 3:43:52.960]  already putting in your water and your food and your vaccines and for all of you out there

[3:44:38.800 --> 3:44:44.080]  sterilization of women in the united states it's still going on by the way they drug these women
[3:44:44.080 --> 3:44:48.480]  up out of their minds they do thousands of them a month still and then they say oh sign a form
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:52.720]  we can sterilize you then we'll let you go then they tire tubes and throw her back out on the
[3:44:52.720 --> 3:44:57.600]  street and again they've got their excuses oh this is white trash or you know this is a poor
[3:44:57.600 --> 3:45:02.640]  black lady they deserve it it's the precedent it sets folks and they're doing it to you so
[3:45:02.640 --> 3:45:07.440]  get yourself a big glass of tap water and just i love being self-medicated and all the other
[3:45:07.440 --> 3:45:12.160]  health problems it gives you and this is the stuff we know they're doing
[3:45:12.160 --> 3:45:21.200]  so the history of this is 150 years ago sir galton and others in england developed this
[3:45:21.200 --> 3:45:27.280]  plan of eugenics the turn of the last century 109 years ago it was adopted the rockefeller family
[3:45:27.280 --> 3:45:32.000]  the Rothschild family and the sax coberg gothers the elites had always believed in breeding and
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:36.240]  genetics and that and that their bloodlines were best even before they had the term genetics
[3:45:36.240 --> 3:45:40.080]  you know kings and queens intermarrying interbreeding believing they had the royal bloodline
[3:45:40.080 --> 3:45:47.040]  i sure you kings and queens exist now that's the history of it they then love the scientists
[3:45:47.040 --> 3:45:51.120]  that told them you're the elites you're the god race you're the best these are all inferior
[3:45:51.120 --> 3:45:55.920]  we've got a column many other societies had done that the israelites had called their enemies when
[3:45:55.920 --> 3:46:00.960]  they came into israel the babelonians would call their enemies uh when they finally beat
[3:46:00.960 --> 3:46:06.320]  hanibal the romans they called and killed whole cities uh julius cesar in the battle for gall
[3:46:06.320 --> 3:46:13.040]  talks about wiping out old groups very old ancient human instinct total war to kill all your enemies
[3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:19.120]  and so they cold bloodedly decided we will create an environmental movement 110 years
[3:46:19.120 --> 3:46:23.280]  ago set up by john d rockefeller he coined the term environmental movement and conservation
[3:46:23.280 --> 3:46:27.600]  nothing to do with it was all about stealing land and property they then set up eugenics
[3:46:28.160 --> 3:46:32.480]  by 1910 they were already killing babies out of the womb the daughter would come and kill the
[3:46:32.480 --> 3:46:37.680]  baby the poor persons baby by the 1920s you made less than a b plus uh you were taken
[3:46:37.680 --> 3:46:42.720]  and sterilized hundreds of thousands a year that's all mainstream news i have the news reels
[3:46:42.720 --> 3:46:48.000]  announcing how good it is the government paid for news reels are in my film saying how great it is
[3:46:48.000 --> 3:46:53.200]  in game that this is u.s government before the movies and before they had tv they would show
[3:46:53.200 --> 3:46:59.680]  newscast before the movies it's in here how they're killing you and then hitler went a little too
[3:46:59.680 --> 3:47:04.640]  quick and it kind of freaked people out when they saw the piles of dead bodies and so julian
[3:47:04.640 --> 3:47:11.600]  huxley and uh bertrand russell and the and the king of england and others all met and said
[3:47:12.400 --> 3:47:16.560]  we've got to figure out a way to sell people on doing this where they like it and they said well
[3:47:16.560 --> 3:47:21.520]  mr rockefeller has the plan of environmentalism we'll teach them humans are bad teach them we're
[3:47:21.520 --> 3:47:27.440]  overpopulated teach them we're all going to die if we don't do this now they have all the dramas
[3:47:27.440 --> 3:47:33.760]  and tv shows and dystopic science fiction movies where they tell you this and so they take your
[3:47:33.760 --> 3:47:39.040]  survival instinct and turn it against itself and say we've got to get rid of humans or we're all
[3:47:39.040 --> 3:47:45.920]  going to die and they have these situational ethics games uh like survivor on tv but that's a bigger
[3:47:45.920 --> 3:47:52.960]  model of lifeboat or spaceship it's a game that public schools nationwide teach in the uh fifth
[3:47:52.960 --> 3:47:57.520]  sixth and seventh grade i was indoctrinated in government programming myself and they say there's
[3:47:57.520 --> 3:48:02.560]  a lifeboat it's a federal grant and there's only enough food for five people but there's 10 and so
[3:48:02.560 --> 3:48:07.360]  we're going to have to vote on who dies so they don't teach you to get outside the box figure out
[3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:15.040]  how to survive put up a plastic sail to collect rainwater uh or you know things like that they
[3:48:15.040 --> 3:48:20.560]  just teach you somebody's going to have to die so it teaches you to think through solutions
[3:48:20.560 --> 3:48:25.520]  by killing fellow humans and then in the game they go we need a social worker we need a doctor
[3:48:25.520 --> 3:48:32.240]  we need a bureaucrat but uh they're taught that the artist dies and the antisocial person dies
[3:48:32.880 --> 3:48:39.520]  and uh and and then sometime in the class they teach us in university as well someone resists
[3:48:39.520 --> 3:48:43.920]  being killed and then they have someone who plays the part of a policeman who kills you
[3:48:43.920 --> 3:48:48.160]  so your children are being simulated to murder you and we're being simulated to take our old
[3:48:48.160 --> 3:48:53.520]  people and get rid of them it's all murder death kill basic programming hope you enjoy it
[3:48:54.640 --> 3:48:58.480]  they now have more hardcore soviet reeducation camp where every major public school in the
[3:48:58.480 --> 3:49:03.040]  country i've seen in elementary school normally fourth grade third to fourth grade they run in
[3:49:03.040 --> 3:49:08.000]  with police and in camo saying i'm home schoolers for the second amendment here to kill you that's
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:12.960]  ap don't believe me and they scream we're home schoolers when we're going to murder you and then
[3:49:12.960 --> 3:49:17.040]  the parents always freak out because they're not told the kids aren't told it's real they defecate
[3:49:17.040 --> 3:49:21.680]  on themselves going to catatonic states are brain damage and mentally ill for decades afterwards
[3:49:21.680 --> 3:49:27.520]  in many cases and the federal grant is to create a psychotic break and to basically make a creative
[3:49:27.520 --> 3:49:32.560]  psychosis and and make the children mentally ill so that's a hardcore soviet reeducation camp
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:39.760]  similar to uh type programming that the uh that the uh north koreans would engage in again it's all
[3:49:39.760 --> 3:49:45.600]  just incredibly hardcore and remember times of london billionaire club embed to curb over population
[3:49:45.600 --> 3:49:53.600]  now here's rockefeller the one independent yesterday rockefeller foundation climate
[3:49:53.600 --> 3:50:03.440]  change will cause civilization to collapse well they are artificially uh collapsing civilization
[3:50:04.160 --> 3:50:12.000]  is what is going on see the globalist brag about this an mpr even brags yeah the you know
[3:50:12.000 --> 3:50:17.280]  the global slowdown is good for the environment because it shuts down our carbon footprint teaches
[3:50:17.280 --> 3:50:21.840]  us to live within our means and al gore prince philip and prince charles all say that and you
[3:50:21.840 --> 3:50:28.240]  can google the headline uh global slowdown or global depression good for environment good for
[3:50:28.240 --> 3:50:33.600]  carbon footprint fact let's put that on screen for folks and i'm showing you the guys are finding
[3:50:33.600 --> 3:50:38.160]  these in like 20 30 seconds you can do the same thing you don't have to believe any of what i'm
[3:50:38.160 --> 3:50:43.280]  saying so they want to make you totally bankrupt totally dependent on them so they can carry out
[3:50:43.280 --> 3:50:49.200]  their blackoff extermination of you and your family so i'll finish up with kind of the overview of
[3:50:49.200 --> 3:50:56.400]  this plan when we get back then we've got a guest coming up as well i'm alec jones you're under eugenics

[3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:07.440]  the people strike back most americans know the significance of july 4th 1776 however few know
[3:53:07.440 --> 3:53:13.680]  the importance of september 17th 1787 the day the constitution was written and adopted by our
[3:53:13.680 --> 3:53:20.000]  founders unfortunately over 200 years later this sacred document is under attack along with our
[3:53:20.000 --> 3:53:24.800]  beloved republic throughout the span of history brave men and women have rallied behind banners
[3:53:24.800 --> 3:53:30.480]  which have served as symbols of liberty against the forces of tyranny today we have the constitution
[3:53:30.480 --> 3:53:37.280]  pride flag to show our support for the constitution the bill of rights freedom liberty and justice for

[3:54:01.040 --> 3:54:24.640]  life has always been cheap there's lots of human beings there's lots of slaves
[3:54:24.640 --> 3:54:32.080]  but now life isn't just cheap it's seen as a negative the elite don't want us there's too many
[3:54:32.080 --> 3:54:38.640]  of us we're gobbling up environment and things they want because their control freaks they want
[3:54:38.640 --> 3:54:49.360]  us to get out of the way they want us to die and i say to the elite how about if you think things
[3:54:49.360 --> 3:54:52.880]  are overpopulated how about you get rid of yourselves first how about you go first how
[3:54:52.880 --> 3:54:58.800]  about you lead by example but most of them say oh no we have to be guardians of this we have to
[3:54:58.800 --> 3:55:03.600]  help get rid of the humans that are parasites many of them say we're just parasites period and all
[3:55:03.600 --> 3:55:08.480]  of us do need to be killed and dr. eric pionka you too said kill 90 percent of us and get standing
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:14.000]  ovations showing the majority of scientists at these events that the news is covered supporting
[3:55:14.560 --> 3:55:19.440]  he was in the news saying yeah i know my family's gonna have to die and gonna have to go as well
[3:55:19.440 --> 3:55:23.600]  and i'm sad about it but it's for the earth when the time comes
[3:55:25.920 --> 3:55:31.520]  and then he's on the official university of texas website dressed up in a druid outfit talking
[3:55:31.520 --> 3:55:39.200]  about lucifer you cannot make this stuff up google dr. eric pionka lucifer and you'll be on
[3:55:39.200 --> 3:55:43.360]  the ut website with him in a druid outfit when he's not talking about he wants to kill everybody
[3:55:43.360 --> 3:55:50.400]  he's talking about lucifer now here's fox news upcoming military robot could feed on human dead
[3:55:50.400 --> 3:55:57.040]  bodies now this is what bill joy owner of sun microsystems billionaire said in 1999
[3:55:59.120 --> 3:56:05.040]  or was it the 2000 april issue of wired magazine why the future doesn't need us was the article
[3:56:05.840 --> 3:56:10.000]  and he said the elite said there's too many of us they don't need us anymore for factories
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:16.160]  or agriculture they have robotics soon robotic lines will be repairing robotic manufacturing
[3:56:16.160 --> 3:56:21.920]  lines the military will convert this to stealth aircraft that are remote controlled and that are
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:27.440]  ai controlled and there'll be factories that service the aircraft that are going to be robotic
[3:56:27.440 --> 3:56:31.280]  and there'll be very limited groups of humans that are needed and the military is going to
[3:56:31.280 --> 3:56:36.080]  convert to robots and i've talked to troops 10 years ago they have super advanced robots
[3:56:36.080 --> 3:56:41.040]  not just the swords they've already used to kill people in iraq well here's fox news
[3:56:41.040 --> 3:56:47.120]  upcoming military robot could feed on dead bodies see the eugenicists are very macabre very very sick
[3:56:47.120 --> 3:56:54.880]  people and army reports in 68 said they would use humans to fuel their robotic system i'm not the
[3:56:54.880 --> 3:56:59.040]  one saying this i know it's crazy i'm not the crazy one i'm just reporting fox news here
[3:56:59.920 --> 3:57:04.640]  and it says robotic technology inks i want this i want that group on tell the producer
[3:57:04.640 --> 3:57:12.880]  energetically autonomous tactical robot called the eater can fight ingest and extract energy
[3:57:12.880 --> 3:57:17.120]  from biomass in the environment and other organically based energy sources as well as use
[3:57:17.120 --> 3:57:23.920]  conventional and alternative fuels such as gasoline heavy fuel kerosene diesel propane coal
[3:57:23.920 --> 3:57:29.760]  cooking oil solar when sustainable reads the company's website see they the elite want
[3:57:29.760 --> 3:57:35.520]  hunter killers and they've said this they're just going to turn loose and so when you see a movie
[3:57:35.520 --> 3:57:42.160]  like terminator i read government documents from the 50s calling their robot drone system
[3:57:42.160 --> 3:57:46.960]  skynet i was in a private meeting with dr bob bowman lieutenant colonel bob bowman who was
[3:57:46.960 --> 3:57:52.000]  the former head of star wars and he talked about the robotic fleet with me but said i can only
[3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:56.960]  talk about what had been declassified and what nsa and others and other people involved with
[3:57:56.960 --> 3:58:02.320]  star wars had accidentally in speeches on c span let's slip up but that there you there's an entire
[3:58:02.320 --> 3:58:12.960]  robotic drone fleet in orbit that's got a d u meteor guns basically a meteor well weapons to
[3:58:12.960 --> 3:58:20.400]  decapitate the leadership the point is everything's going to a robotic fleet that that's then
[3:58:20.400 --> 3:58:26.240]  robotically controlled not human piloted and that is robotically serviced and folks they're
[3:58:26.240 --> 3:58:30.400]  about 10 years away from this and that way they can launch terror attacks blaming on others
[3:58:30.400 --> 3:58:35.920]  if the military refuses to have the drone aircraft takeoff with the nerve gas to kill every major
[3:58:35.920 --> 3:58:44.640]  city the elite can just order this and sit back and watch it happen you are listening to gcn
