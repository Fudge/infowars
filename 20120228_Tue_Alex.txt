[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:44.080]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well here we are my friend
[00:44.080 --> 00:54.640]  it is Tuesday it is the 28th day of February 2012 and we are going to be live here for the
[00:54.640 --> 01:01.280]  next three hours Aaron Dykes will be sitting in with Cindy Sheehan who's being persecuted
[01:01.280 --> 01:05.320]  for not paying money to the private Federal Reserve that occupies the United States we're
[01:05.320 --> 01:12.680]  doing a test here doing the show as we roll down the road in the bus while it's on because
[01:12.680 --> 01:16.800]  if we pull over and they go to backup power for some reason the power supplies beat the
[01:16.800 --> 01:20.320]  entire time so if you hear a rumble there in the background this is just the way it
[01:20.320 --> 01:25.680]  is we'll probably get Aaron Dykes to come in here and do the whole show now continuing
[01:25.680 --> 01:30.320]  ladies and gentlemen I had a particularly powerful and important broadcast lined up
[01:30.320 --> 01:36.360]  for you today of the greatest import and there is a great culture of denial out there with
[01:36.360 --> 01:45.800]  people not aware of what's going on or just how serious this society's peril is and I
[01:45.800 --> 01:57.440]  look at the stories and info down I look at the guests we have on and you guys are feeding
[01:57.440 --> 02:10.560]  me back my audio all right well we are beta testing the road trip situation and it's
[02:10.560 --> 02:14.800]  good it's kind of like NASA like testing rockets the first time they go to the moon it's like
[02:14.800 --> 02:18.240]  this is the first time we've done this we're not even testing this rocket we're going
[02:18.240 --> 02:24.000]  to put the guys in the capsule blast off have it blow up on the tarmac that's how we do it
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.440]  that's part of the secret gladiatorial enjoyment of the emperors back there at the office torturing
[02:29.440 --> 02:38.280]  the daylight side of me daily but I don't know back to what I was saying I'll compose
[02:38.280 --> 02:42.720]  myself and go to break here and Richard I think we should just go with the generator
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.800]  off and let the incessant beeping happen in the background better than this here on air
[02:47.800 --> 02:51.120]  and since I won't have time to discuss during the break there won't even be discussion during
[02:51.120 --> 02:55.040]  the break let's talk to the hand I might as well just go ahead and have a discussion
[02:55.040 --> 03:04.120]  here on air because that way we know everybody actually gets to hear me talk but again because
[03:04.120 --> 03:09.560]  the TSA tries to grab my genitals which I'm supposed to accept as a sacrament of being
[03:09.560 --> 03:14.640]  a land of the coward homeless slave I did the road trip and it was a spectacular success
[03:14.640 --> 03:21.760]  in Dallas and in Orlando both were capacity crowds unfortunately they told they turned
[03:21.760 --> 03:27.440]  people away at both events and so next time we do venues we've got to get venues that
[03:27.440 --> 03:33.000]  hold more than a thousand people and I could have done more venues as well we're just testing
[03:33.000 --> 03:40.840]  it hitting two locations and it's always booing to get to meet like minded people put and kill
[03:40.840 --> 03:50.480]  it thanks to meet like minded people and it's always great to be able to know we can just
[03:50.480 --> 03:53.240]  mess with it while I'm on air because we do this during the break trying to fix it will
[03:53.240 --> 03:57.620]  never happen we'll just do this all out in the open on air that way I'll actually get
[03:57.620 --> 04:04.920]  fixed anyways back to what I was saying it is booing to get to meet people it is amazing
[04:04.920 --> 04:09.160]  to go out and actually see info warriors of every race color creed and religion out there
[04:09.160 --> 04:16.600]  who all bleed red and who have the love of freedom and dignity in their hearts see problem
[04:16.600 --> 04:25.760]  solved it's like magic and I want to say the cruise on a great job again this is our exploratory
[04:25.760 --> 04:32.800]  operation here as we travel out in the info wars command vehicle across the United States

[09:29.320 --> 09:34.640]  me speak as well as jim mars visiting with us and i want to thank the folks out in or
[09:34.640 --> 09:40.640]  lando as well at the big eight ten or number one against russia lembaugh for doing a great
[09:40.640 --> 09:49.040]  job it was amazing seeing a thousand plus like-minded people out at that event and have countless
[09:49.040 --> 09:55.640]  current serving military personnel coming forward talking about how the military is
[09:55.640 --> 10:02.960]  waking up in mass to what the new world order is up to so the awakening is certainly happening
[10:02.960 --> 10:08.240]  and people kept using the term info wars saves lives i mean i wasn't there talking
[10:08.240 --> 10:14.600]  about vitamin and mineral replacement from natural sources like i do maybe once a month
[10:14.600 --> 10:21.840]  on the radio show or something and in dalis and in or lando i had person after person
[10:21.840 --> 10:27.120]  after person come up to me in person or up to the microphone during the question and
[10:27.120 --> 10:33.640]  answer and say hey i had a lupus and they said i was going to die but a year ago i started
[10:33.640 --> 10:39.320]  taking vitamins and minerals and getting off aspartame and getting off gmo and i'm better
[10:39.320 --> 10:44.600]  i'm well this was not like some holy roller convention where they ask people at the back
[10:44.600 --> 10:49.800]  of the entrance when they come in hey what's wrong with you and then the preacher says
[10:49.800 --> 10:54.280]  i know there's somebody out there in the crowd who just had their gallbladder removed woman
[10:54.280 --> 10:58.400]  is like that's me that's me how did they know because you filled out a questionnaire entering
[10:58.400 --> 11:02.760]  the place this was not a health conference this was not about any of that and it was
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.200]  just so many of the listeners were coming out saying my wife was gonna have to have surgery
[11:07.200 --> 11:12.440]  but she heard your guest and got off aspartame or i was going blind and i got off aspartame
[11:12.440 --> 11:18.720]  my vision has come back or i had cancer and juiced and lost a hundred pounds and it's
[11:18.720 --> 11:23.040]  in total remission and gone and they said the surgery wasn't even gonna help me in radiation
[11:23.040 --> 11:27.520]  wouldn't save me i mean it was just blowing me away and i was not even there i was there
[11:27.520 --> 11:31.360]  to talk about the threat of the new world order and a blueprint to defeat them and it was i'd
[11:31.360 --> 11:38.360]  say a third of the people coming up to me in person
[12:01.360 --> 12:23.520]  just one look at mainstream news will make any rational thinker conclude that americans
[12:23.520 --> 12:30.080]  are in a hyper state of denial public opinion is in a stranglehold when it comes to real
[12:30.080 --> 12:36.000]  open honest debate whether it's the looming war in iran based on fear mongering and little
[12:36.000 --> 12:42.520]  fact or the blind eye given to ron paul's agenda to get the country back to its constitutional
[12:42.520 --> 12:47.760]  values the new suffocate university poll shows him with a commanding lead in new hampshire
[12:47.760 --> 12:53.240]  at almost 30 points above his rivals at the same time newt gingrich and john huntsman
[12:53.240 --> 12:59.440]  have faltered rick santorum who polls in single digits here is looking to give romney
[12:59.440 --> 13:05.280]  a run in the granite state after his near victory in iowa are people aware that they
[13:05.280 --> 13:10.160]  could be kidnapped detained without trial and sent away to a torture facility for an
[13:10.160 --> 13:17.040]  untimely death simply based on the description of domestic terrorism denial comes in three
[13:17.040 --> 13:24.000]  forms according to sigmond freud simple denial deny the reality of the unpleasant fact altogether
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.080]  you feel like you get all the information you need for mainstream media no i don't i
[13:28.080 --> 13:32.840]  hardly watch the news anyway and i'm in a lying in deception class right now and we talked
[13:32.840 --> 13:39.040]  about media and like news and how most of it is just they take like the smallest thing
[13:39.040 --> 13:43.680]  possible it's not a big deal and blow it out of proportion so you at least feel like something
[13:43.680 --> 13:48.440]  importance going on when in fact like there are other things that could be covered that
[13:48.440 --> 13:54.560]  i mean they don't want to cover they don't minimization admit the fact but deny its
[13:54.560 --> 14:01.280]  seriousness just wanted to ask you if you've heard about the ndaa legislation the bill
[14:01.280 --> 14:07.200]  that allows the president to detain american citizens whisk them away off to a torture
[14:07.200 --> 14:13.240]  facility and never be seen again that that's been legalized as of this year are you aware
[14:13.240 --> 14:18.120]  of this i actually have part of that that's like how they weren't going to close guantanamo
[14:18.120 --> 14:22.480]  that was like the legislation that like decided that i believe if you're labeled a domestic
[14:22.480 --> 14:26.880]  terrorist which could include the fact that you're missing fingers that you bought beer
[14:26.880 --> 14:32.480]  at a store with cash that you bought baby formula do you take that seriously or would
[14:32.480 --> 14:38.640]  you feel like yes that may be happening but it's probably for a good reason um because
[14:38.640 --> 14:42.480]  i don't know the details like i want to say that it could possibly be for a good a good
[14:42.480 --> 14:50.800]  reason projection admit both the fact and the seriousness but deny responsibility once
[14:50.800 --> 14:55.920]  the war against it on begins we expect every american to support our military and if they
[14:55.920 --> 15:02.360]  can't do that to shut up would you be more prone to say yeah that's happening but there's
[15:02.360 --> 15:08.160]  nothing you can do about it um i i don't think that there's nothing that can be done i think
[15:08.160 --> 15:12.040]  enough people are informed about it and the more people that are informed the more people
[15:12.040 --> 15:16.920]  can you know have an input and say and one voice you know adds to that change so i mean
[15:16.920 --> 15:22.360]  what's the entire point of this bill domestic terrorism they want to they want to quiet their
[15:22.360 --> 15:27.040]  critics where we represent the alternative media mainstream media didn't even cover
[15:27.040 --> 15:32.480]  ndaa i have an idea that you know the media is like you know sponsored by certain you
[15:32.480 --> 15:37.040]  know political parties and also certain people with power within this country and they don't
[15:37.040 --> 15:43.840]  allow certain information to be you know transmitted to the masses out of you know it just wouldn't
[15:43.840 --> 15:51.000]  be right for the for the normal person psyche american citizens are distracted by a number
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.640]  of worthless time consuming outlets we are all addicted to our own self importance the
[15:57.640 --> 16:04.320]  only way to begin to treat addiction whether it is alcohol or drugs for example is to break
[16:04.320 --> 16:11.520]  the cycle of denial the mainstream media delivers a skewed reality manipulating the american
[16:11.520 --> 16:18.640]  landscape with their theater of denial isn't it amazing that we're denying our own slavery
[16:18.640 --> 16:29.760]  to a system fueled by that very denial john bound info wars nightly news okay folks i
[16:29.760 --> 16:34.480]  was planning to do a whole talk today on air about denial and then get to john bound's
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.040]  piece that was excellent on denial elixir i'm coming to give you a cell phone here on
[16:39.040 --> 16:44.280]  the info wars command us while we're trying to get our system connected back up to the
[16:44.280 --> 16:49.920]  network era dykes is waiting in the wings as well speaking of denial i wanted to go
[16:49.920 --> 16:55.120]  over a few articles dealing with that look at this article you talk lawmakers urge congress
[16:55.120 --> 17:02.320]  to repeal indefinite detention law latest state to revolt against kidnapping provisions
[17:02.320 --> 17:07.560]  of ndaa but i thought it was a conspiracy theory that the ndaa allowed the secret arrest
[17:07.560 --> 17:13.560]  of citizens and the secret disappearance of black torture sites of course they first said
[17:13.560 --> 17:18.080]  it was a conspiracy theory when i wanted to get it passed once it did pass obama signed
[17:18.080 --> 17:22.560]  it which he promised to not do and they told the world that yes we will secretly arrest
[17:22.560 --> 17:31.040]  you and kill you all three senators that wrote it and sponsored it laborman of course mcgain
[17:31.040 --> 17:38.520]  and graham albright yes we won't just arrest you with no charges we will kill you oh alex
[17:38.520 --> 17:42.480]  down zero fear monger saying the government wants to use the military against this will
[17:42.480 --> 17:46.760]  secretly arrest us and kill us ladies and gentlemen they've got black sites all over
[17:46.760 --> 17:50.720]  the country the washington post two weeks ago three weeks ago had a big article about
[17:50.720 --> 17:56.920]  oh some people in the town there's controversy over the rendition camp where they take people
[17:56.920 --> 18:04.040]  and pull them out of the jets there's a torture center and there's an area some hangers and
[18:04.040 --> 18:10.120]  they hold them and there's some activists who don't think it's very good i mean it's
[18:10.120 --> 18:15.200]  camps hidden in your face and still i have people to come up to me at my event and say
[18:15.200 --> 18:19.400]  look how like your show but are you serious there's really camps i don't know they have
[18:19.400 --> 18:25.000]  the emergency centers establishment act i don't know they have rec 84 i don't know they

[18:29.960 --> 18:34.760]  act they had rec 84 congressional hearings on plans to arrest political dissidents in
[18:34.760 --> 18:40.600]  the program already in place in congress in 1986 i have all the video clips about my
[18:40.600 --> 18:45.440]  films and people say well i want to see a copy of that i'm standing there in a hallway
[18:45.440 --> 18:49.520]  and i go but i just gave you the name of it go look it up they're like i don't know
[18:49.520 --> 18:55.880]  i believe you because there's this childlike denial that the government can't and won't
[18:55.880 --> 19:00.680]  and wouldn't do something bad to them oh the government's not shipping guys in Mexico
[19:00.680 --> 19:05.440]  okay they are but they're not going to play the second amendment yeah they are the documents
[19:05.440 --> 19:13.240]  come out of this so there's one big giant humongous uh piece of uh denial here's another
[19:13.240 --> 19:20.240]  one you uh ethicists that's the bioethicists they don't have the uh hippocratic oath anymore
[19:20.240 --> 19:25.200]  ethicists aren't you killing newborn babies should be allowed including healthy babies
[19:25.200 --> 19:33.320]  in america kill them this is american medical association sponsored paper says kill babies

[19:39.240 --> 19:48.520]  us it's not eugenics though i'm a conspiracy theorist folks have you lost your power and
[19:48.520 --> 19:52.880]  wanted to simply flip a switch to the lights back on if so this is going to be the most

[25:00.440 --> 25:07.480]  or five of the stories I have here today and then separately I talked to Dave Mustaine
[25:07.480 --> 25:12.600]  this morning about his Santorum comment and quite frankly when it happened a few weeks
[25:12.600 --> 25:18.720]  ago I had not been checking my phone a lot and just get so busy that I didn't know that
[25:18.720 --> 25:22.040]  they've been calling me and texting me I've got to where I don't really read my email
[25:22.040 --> 25:26.200]  answer my phone or check anything anymore because I'm so busy just covering news all
[25:26.200 --> 25:32.000]  the time and turns out I could have had Dave on right after that happened instead of him
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.400]  basically putting a press release out to explain he didn't endorse Santorum but that's a side
[25:38.400 --> 25:44.640]  issue Dave is coming to town next week to Austin and I'll just leave it at that we'll
[25:44.640 --> 25:54.320]  have some surprises for you with that with Dave Mustaine but I talked to him this morning
[25:54.320 --> 25:57.920]  luckily I was going through old voicemails and text messages I'm like all these messages
[25:57.920 --> 26:04.560]  from Dave I got to get a new cell phone I've had this cell phone for for 12 years with
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.640]  this and this phone number so I know I had it when I stuck in the Bohemian Grove this
[26:08.640 --> 26:13.520]  current number and it's out there everywhere and people just pounded everyone's giving
[26:13.520 --> 26:18.320]  it out to everybody and they just pounded and just rings and rings and text messages
[26:18.320 --> 26:24.640]  just boom boom boom boom boom come into it towards basically worthless people always
[26:24.640 --> 26:30.640]  ask me why do you not have email what why can't I send you an email and it's because
[26:30.640 --> 26:36.280]  I get 10,000 emails a day on the addresses I had or more and I'm not complaining it's
[26:36.280 --> 26:42.720]  just you know I'll hear from Discovery Channel or History Channel or a famous musician or
[26:42.720 --> 26:46.640]  whatever it is or or or Congress person with breaking news and they're like I've tried
[26:46.640 --> 26:51.960]  to get a hold of you for three months so I've got to just get crew dedicated to just going
[26:51.960 --> 26:56.240]  over the email I don't know how Drudge does it you can send Drudge an email you can put
[26:56.240 --> 27:01.480]  it in that little box and a lot of times he'll post it in an hour of his interesting news
[27:01.480 --> 27:08.080]  I mean he's actually I guess on it and better at it than I am because I am just overwhelmed
[27:08.080 --> 27:15.800]  and and that's what the globalists are trying to do to every realm everyone with so much
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.800]  happening in your daily life so much work so many little odds and so much red tape so
[27:20.800 --> 27:25.600]  much information that you just tune it all out you kind of roll over to it and I far
[27:25.600 --> 27:30.160]  from do that instead of rolling over to the information and just giving up I kind of dive
[27:30.160 --> 27:35.120]  into it but then whatever I run into first or whatever I think is the most threatening
[27:35.120 --> 27:40.920]  thing I kind of tunnel vision into that and then weeks go by months go by and it seems
[27:40.920 --> 27:48.720]  like hours now and everybody's talking about this speeding up of time to where I look down
[27:48.720 --> 27:51.760]  and my children are growing it looks like an inch a day or something but really it's
[27:51.760 --> 27:57.160]  an inch every six months they're growing up and I'm busy here fighting the new world
[27:57.160 --> 28:02.320]  order but you know what they have no future if we don't do this so it's it's all worth
[28:02.320 --> 28:10.120]  it and then some and the same thing happens this whole speeding up of time this whole
[28:10.120 --> 28:14.960]  speeding up of life running to and fro all these little whack-a-mole things we've got
[28:14.960 --> 28:22.160]  to do that feeds in to the denial as well because people are so busy they just go whatever
[28:22.160 --> 28:26.000]  I can't deal with it you know more and more people say look you're not making this stuff
[28:26.000 --> 28:31.400]  up about tyranny okay you're right you were right about all this which is no consolation
[28:31.400 --> 28:34.840]  because people don't take actions so what if I'm right this isn't about being right
[28:34.840 --> 28:39.480]  before other people were this isn't about going and studying history and globalist activities
[28:39.480 --> 28:44.960]  and being and right it's about being right and waking people up and stopping this and
[28:44.960 --> 28:49.760]  but more and more people don't say oh you're a conspiracy theorist making stuff up or haha
[28:49.760 --> 28:52.760]  you're a kooky they go yeah you're right okay you're right about it all what are we gonna
[28:52.760 --> 28:58.160]  do there's nothing you can do well there is stuff we can do when we do take action and
[28:58.160 --> 29:04.200]  in my speech blueprint to defeat the new world order I talked a lot about that and that's
[29:04.200 --> 29:11.720]  what I'm doing now here today but I'm gonna reset and I am going to come back and give
[29:11.720 --> 29:18.600]  you the big news ethicist are you killing newborn babies good feet whole study at FEMA

[34:57.360 --> 35:10.160]  it already is and against political dissidents now continuing here i remember 1415 years
[35:10.160 --> 35:16.520]  ago reading one of the top professors was the head of the biology department at princeton
[35:16.520 --> 35:22.880]  dr peter singer and countless others studying the globalist studying the enemy and what
[35:22.880 --> 35:30.760]  they're into and i would say the vast majority more than 70% of the heads of psychology departments
[35:30.760 --> 35:39.160]  anthropology sociology biology and ethics sections in medical schools if you just go
[35:39.160 --> 35:44.040]  randomly check the head of your medical school the head of the biology department at a major
[35:44.040 --> 35:50.760]  university or medical school and type in their name under population control eugenics things
[35:50.760 --> 35:57.520]  like that you're going to find out that about 70 plus percent on average are public eugenicists
[35:57.520 --> 36:01.920]  you don't get the phd's you don't get into the club unless you are that's how they run
[36:01.920 --> 36:08.120]  things and i've quoted peter singer saying you should be able to kill your children
[36:08.120 --> 36:14.920]  up to age three and he says of course then after that they get that legal i'm not joking
[36:14.920 --> 36:23.600]  this is not satire okay um this is not a job okay i'm i'm being serious you can look this
[36:23.600 --> 36:33.080]  up kind of like when i say uh schools all across the us arrest 56789 10 year olds for
[36:33.080 --> 36:39.080]  running at recess you type that into a search engine you'll get ap you'll get roiders with
[36:39.080 --> 36:45.280]  straight faces saying this is good it's absurd because in an authoritarian system the truth
[36:45.280 --> 36:52.560]  and common sense is the enemy as rod sirling was saying introducing the twilight zone back
[36:52.560 --> 36:58.240]  in the 60s it's here truth and common sense two plus two equals four is a menace is a
[36:58.240 --> 37:03.040]  crime freedom is the ability to say two plus two equals four and i thought eric blair writing
[37:03.040 --> 37:07.800]  under the pen name george arwell when he wrote that was being sarcastic or absurdist when
[37:07.800 --> 37:12.040]  i was a teenager and even when i was in college and re-read it i didn't fully grasp it it's
[37:12.040 --> 37:17.280]  only until now i realize that whole book is what he witnessed working for the imperial
[37:17.280 --> 37:22.640]  british and india for the stalling and the soviets in spain and then for the bbc and
[37:22.640 --> 37:26.840]  the top globalist and of course blair wrote right before he died of tuberculosis they
[37:26.840 --> 37:31.040]  claim about a year after it was published that actually his whole book can only be published
[37:31.040 --> 37:36.720]  by off of what he thought was really going to happen as fiction because he was not a
[37:36.720 --> 37:41.280]  fiction writer he wrote a whole bunch of great books very powerful that were nonfiction about
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.160]  what he witnessed he was more of a socialist but he figured out it was controlled but i'm
[37:46.160 --> 37:53.720]  digressing freedom is the ability to say two plus two equals four it is because i'm the
[37:53.720 --> 38:01.680]  extremist because i happen to be informed and i and i question known confirmed liars
[38:01.680 --> 38:08.160]  that have been caught engaged in every form of evil you can imagine i am the bad guy i
[38:08.160 --> 38:14.240]  am the bad man i am the person who's evil i need to live in denial i need to just be
[38:14.240 --> 38:19.120]  passive i need to just go quietly into the night i need to just shut up well no the
[38:19.120 --> 38:24.480]  answer is i'm normal i'm got my head screwed on straight i'm an aggressive intelligent
[38:24.480 --> 38:28.840]  male who wants to protect my family and to do that i've got to be informed and i've got
[38:28.840 --> 38:33.640]  to mobilize people so we can collectively defeat these globalist collectivist through
[38:33.640 --> 38:38.640]  our individual actions but through a collective love of liberty and freedom and common sense
[38:38.640 --> 38:46.320]  the globalist and authoritarians wage war on common sense on due process and on reality
[38:46.320 --> 38:52.560]  they don't arrest the father of a four year old in head start programs because she draws
[38:52.560 --> 38:58.920]  a gun because they're crazy or fearful or dumb they're exercising power as the thought
[38:58.920 --> 39:05.720]  police they don't taser an old woman until she's brain dead because she didn't answer
[39:05.720 --> 39:11.560]  police questions at a checkpoint because they're out of control and stupid they do it because
[39:11.560 --> 39:17.000]  it's about a total exercise of raw power the tsa doesn't go in your pants and actually
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.920]  squeeze your body parts or go into miss america's pants miss usa's pants to be technical always
[39:22.920 --> 39:28.240]  mix those two up miss usa in dallas till she cries they don't pull women's shirts off and
[39:28.240 --> 39:33.080]  ask them out on dates in amarillo because they're they're crazy or out of control they're
[39:33.080 --> 39:42.040]  crazy thugs but they're crazy like a fox it's about breaking your will now paul watson
[39:42.040 --> 39:49.640]  has a link to the university of melbourne paper on applied philosophy and public ethics
[39:49.640 --> 39:55.280]  at the university of melbourne this is out of australia but you can go pull up the american
[39:55.280 --> 40:03.680]  medical association sponsored type groups you can go look at these what they've done
[40:03.680 --> 40:06.920]  is they've gotten rid of the hypocritical that they've had for thousands of years of
[40:06.920 --> 40:12.960]  a doctor does no harm a doctor must help the poor at least a third of their practice it
[40:12.960 --> 40:18.520]  is an honor to be part of the doctor priesthood that's what it is that was the ancient priesthood
[40:18.520 --> 40:27.080]  of what is it apocrates gone for at least what is it 20 years now in the u.s. longer
[40:27.080 --> 40:33.680]  in england they do not give the hypocritical now they are part of a bioethicis guild and
[40:33.680 --> 40:39.020]  they say well bioethicis is just the ethics of medical stuff no it's been set up to replace
[40:39.020 --> 40:46.040]  the hypocritical and it is set up and directed by eugenicists and they and and they get
[40:46.040 --> 40:49.880]  off on the power trip of they'll decide what's going to happen they'll decide if your kid's
[40:49.880 --> 40:53.880]  going to have an abortion they'll decide who's inoculated they'll decide that well the vaccine
[40:53.880 --> 40:58.880]  kills one out of a thousand but we claim it has a greater good so we say you have no freedom
[40:58.880 --> 41:05.160]  they're the doctors that report you there are the doctors that have you arrested if you
[41:05.160 --> 41:08.720]  don't do what they say and the police come and arrest you even though there's no law
[41:08.720 --> 41:16.920]  doesn't matter happens all the time now they are the bioethicis and you can pull up everywhere
[41:16.920 --> 41:23.320]  where they say babies are mackerel that's a peter singer quote and they have big events
[41:23.320 --> 41:27.080]  where all the bioethicis come you know the top ones thousands you ought to read the
[41:27.080 --> 41:30.720]  minutes of these it's all public go look it up yourself it's an endless ocean I could
[41:30.720 --> 41:35.640]  never even scratch the surface and all they talk about is how they're going to kill granny
[41:35.640 --> 41:39.640]  to hire ten teachers that's the standard line to the bureaucrats you'll get raises you'll
[41:39.640 --> 41:43.560]  get more jobs if we kill all people remember bill gates you think I'm joking just type
[41:43.560 --> 41:49.880]  in bill gates endorses death panels and he says well we've got teachers here this is
[41:49.880 --> 41:55.240]  an education conference this little nitty nitty non-threatening fake voice his real
[41:55.240 --> 42:00.800]  voice is like Bill Gates and their dominate but he has that MP you know if you could hear
[42:00.800 --> 42:06.560]  his inner voice just absolute slayer of pure death but he has the oh I'm trendy non-threatening
[42:06.560 --> 42:12.680]  eye globalists are totally into that and of course that's an ancient thing going back
[42:12.680 --> 42:16.240]  to the gentleman that wore fancy clothes and acted real friendly but would take you outside
[42:16.240 --> 42:20.440]  in a sword fight if you talk wrong to him and stab you to death so that's about controlled
[42:20.440 --> 42:28.160]  viciousness and that's what Bill Gates does and he's like teachers let me tell you let
[42:28.160 --> 42:32.720]  me tell you how you we probably pull the clip we play the clip like 20 times you can pull
[42:32.720 --> 42:39.640]  it up bill Gates is like we don't give the grandma that end of life care for that year
[42:39.640 --> 42:44.880]  keep her alive we can you're not supposed to say this is death panels but true you don't
[42:44.880 --> 42:51.000]  give her end of life care you hard 10 teachers and the teachers are like I mean they start
[42:51.000 --> 42:57.240]  clapping they're ooh ooh ooh they're gonna get some free goodies so this is the culture
[42:57.240 --> 43:04.200]  first they collectivize things and then once things have been collectivized once this has
[43:04.200 --> 43:09.560]  happened once this has been set up once this has been developed once this has been put
[43:09.560 --> 43:15.680]  in place they say well we're gonna decide what you can eat how you can live how much
[43:15.680 --> 43:19.720]  energy you can use how much you can travel because it's a collective and you're taking
[43:19.720 --> 43:23.760]  other people's resources and you're taking their health care that we've been collectivized
[43:23.760 --> 43:28.680]  into I mean it's a nightmare it's like having every control freak in your city living in
[43:28.680 --> 43:33.560]  a big dormitory with you can you imagine all the control freaks and chicken necks and neurotic
[43:33.560 --> 43:38.200]  cowardly weirdos that are waging war against reality and manhood and womanhood and family
[43:38.200 --> 43:46.520]  and they just henpeck it and attack it from every angle the safety sally nazi soviet jackboots
[43:46.520 --> 43:53.600]  for everyone to call them can you imagine every nattering ninny pushy ninny male and
[43:53.600 --> 43:58.640]  ninny female given the black uniform given the power of the state and given control of
[43:58.640 --> 44:05.280]  your life that's what big government is that's what collectivism is and everyone who excels
[44:05.280 --> 44:11.640]  being denigrated and attacked and and sucked off of by the big mega bankers that control
[44:11.640 --> 44:18.600]  the giant corpulent servant class beneath them vampires on top sucking our blood and
[44:18.600 --> 44:25.040]  cockroach vampire maggots from below burrowing into our intestines from beneath through
[44:25.040 --> 44:30.280]  the first entry they find and and just chewing our guts out and telling us we should thank
[44:30.280 --> 44:37.560]  them for it being stampeded over by a bunch of just greedy hateful folks who who I've
[44:37.560 --> 44:42.960]  learned a lot of the public hates handsome people and good looking people and happy people
[44:42.960 --> 44:47.600]  and hate people that build things and hate people that have nice things and hate people
[44:47.600 --> 44:51.520]  that have good lives and hate it when they see your family doing good and looking good
[44:51.520 --> 44:55.840]  and being cheerful they want to wreck your life that's what the new world order is they
[44:55.840 --> 45:00.720]  want to stick their hands down your pants and they want to kill your baby and that's
[45:00.720 --> 45:04.640]  why until three and a half years ago every insert on every vaccine said never give a
[45:04.640 --> 45:10.480]  pregnant woman a vaccine it causes autoimmune response and the rejection of the baby standard
[45:10.480 --> 45:15.840]  101 for all nurses all doctors listening know it suddenly they just went you know what we
[45:15.840 --> 45:21.280]  recommend extra shots for pregnant women to just test give them the shots watch the women's
[45:21.280 --> 45:26.320]  babies die and they die and mash hear about it everywhere and it's just like that's trendy
[45:26.320 --> 45:31.720]  they're like shut up conspiracy theorist all right continuing ethicists argue killing
[45:31.720 --> 45:39.080]  newborn babies should be allowed info wars dot com we've got so much news this is already
[45:39.080 --> 45:43.400]  rolled off the front page that's it's an incredible article I think everybody should
[45:43.400 --> 45:49.440]  read this shocking reminder that eugenicist beliefs underpin medical establishment a
[45:49.440 --> 45:54.560]  paper published in the journal of medical ethics that's the biggest one funded by the
[45:54.560 --> 45:59.400]  american medical association and others that abortion should be extended to make the killing
[45:59.400 --> 46:04.280]  of newborn babies permissible even the baby is perfectly healthy you heard me right and
[46:04.280 --> 46:09.440]  see we're the bad people now you're like you don't want to kill a baby you're an extremist
[46:09.440 --> 46:14.880]  and I'm like no I'm not like yes you are the big TV agrees with me it's trendy the TV
[46:14.880 --> 46:20.720]  says run off a cliff trendy everything's about trendiness in a shocking example of how the
[46:20.720 --> 46:26.880]  medical establishment is still dominated by eugenicist mindset the paper is authored by
[46:26.880 --> 46:36.760]  alberto gibolini of monash university in melbourne and francesca minerva on the center for applied
[46:36.760 --> 46:41.040]  philosophy at the public ethics at the university of melbourne and they sit up there as the high
[46:41.040 --> 46:45.760]  priest in hospitals now all over the world including the u.s. the wall street journal
[46:45.760 --> 46:49.920]  we need to get wesley smith back on that best-selling author that chronicles in each book hundreds
[46:49.920 --> 46:55.000]  of cases where people don't have family or whatever and they're paralyzed neck down in
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.680]  some cases chest down and they're don't know what they're doing and end up signing their
[46:59.680 --> 47:04.480]  estate over to the government and the government murders them for their money and I mean there's
[47:04.480 --> 47:09.200]  videos of them going please I haven't had water or food in eight days I'm getting dizzy
[47:09.200 --> 47:14.800]  I want to live and then usually it's some court order that even gets you know a distant cousin
[47:14.800 --> 47:19.120]  in to see him and there's video I've covered these cases looking up nurses every time I talk
[47:19.120 --> 47:24.080]  about it calling oh it's true they're murdering somebody on floor five right now and we're not
[47:24.080 --> 47:29.040]  talking about just terry shy though where she's alive but can't move and has brain activity
[47:29.040 --> 47:36.400]  we're talking about people talking please don't kill me please and they murdered them by dehydration
[47:36.400 --> 47:43.200]  they just turn the lights down it's bed sore time oh yeah the bed sores oh it's fun in the uh
[47:43.200 --> 47:46.960]  every time I say this people don't believe me but you can search it all over the US I've seen
[47:46.960 --> 47:55.920]  case after case last decade of flies going up the nose of veterans at VA hospitals and laying
[47:55.920 --> 48:02.320]  eggs in the sinus and then having a brain meal people are like but I thought screwworms were
[48:02.320 --> 48:07.760]  eradicated no no no regular bottle flies will go up the nose of nobody's there and though they're
[48:07.760 --> 48:13.280]  not supposed to be able to lay eggs in live flesh they can lay them in the sinus then they'll necrose
[48:13.280 --> 48:18.720]  eat it and they get a brain meal so yes regular flies will have a brain meal and I'm an extremist
[48:18.720 --> 48:23.200]  because I don't want veterans having their brains eaten in brain meals I should just stick a sticker
[48:23.200 --> 48:28.720]  on my car and go I care about the troops launch more wars have them breathe do you kill all the
[48:28.720 --> 48:33.280]  Arabs will kill all the Arabs our own stinking governments radicalizing the muslims and putting
[48:33.280 --> 48:40.720]  an al-qaeda in charge everywhere all right continuing here the authors agree that both
[48:40.720 --> 48:45.600]  fetuses and newborns do not have the same moral status as actual persons really in good cultures
[48:45.600 --> 48:50.320]  they have even more protection because they're defenseless from wolves like you but you know
[48:50.320 --> 48:55.520]  that's how it is common sense just trample it two plus two doesn't equal four now i'm trendy
[48:55.520 --> 49:01.600]  the paper goes on they argue that both fetuses and newborns do not have the same moral status
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.240]  as actual persons and that because abortion is allowed even when there is no problem with
[49:06.240 --> 49:11.440]  the fetus health killing a newborn should be permissible in all the cases where abortion
[49:11.440 --> 49:17.440]  is including cases where the newborn is not disabled that's quote now you heard me right
[49:17.440 --> 49:24.720]  these are the heads of their departments last time I checked singer was the head of the philosophy
[49:24.720 --> 49:29.520]  and he was also in the biology department I forget go look up Peter singer I mean they're
[49:29.520 --> 49:34.720]  everywhere and and and they don't care because they've got the establishment but behind them
[49:36.720 --> 49:42.800]  continuing the fact that both the potential persons is morally irrelevant oh their potential
[49:42.800 --> 49:48.320]  person see it's this idea of we're liberal and trendy we say you're old and don't have a life
[49:48.320 --> 49:53.760]  worth living and we say you're not a person we're the high priest board that decides if you're
[49:53.760 --> 50:00.480]  obsolete or not in fact we played one of the intro clips for the obsolete man from the 1960s but
[50:00.480 --> 50:04.720]  maybe when we come into the next time we can play the big one where he's like you are obsolete
[50:04.720 --> 50:12.160]  words worth and he's like no I'm a human being and he goes words words worth the state has decided
[50:12.160 --> 50:19.520]  there's no use for you how did they know that in a 60s episode well because Rod Serling and what
[50:19.520 --> 50:24.320]  been a paratrooper in world war two an anti-communist he knew about authoritarianism he studied the
[50:24.320 --> 50:30.480]  communist was anti-comy this is what the commies did they sent psychologists to arrest you by the
[50:30.480 --> 50:35.120]  way we do now have listeners that talk about FEMA camps confirmed by name are being arrested

[54:21.760 --> 54:25.760]  shut up and the rest of what we played a shorter version of it but i want to play that where they're
[54:25.760 --> 54:31.760]  saying the state is god and we decide that you're obsolete because you read that these these bioethics
[54:31.760 --> 54:36.640]  papers they're putting out that's what they're saying and they are killing thousands and thousands
[54:36.640 --> 54:43.040]  of americans who end up being wards of the state so they're already euthanizing people
[54:43.040 --> 54:47.040]  and they and they introduce it to the public like you should have the right to say you want to be
[54:47.040 --> 54:53.120]  killed what you don't understand is they are going to decide that because of the collective
[54:53.120 --> 54:56.480]  you're not going to be taken care of i mean already in england they don't give you a knee
[54:56.480 --> 55:02.800]  surgery they don't give you eye surgery they give you a cane you wait 18 months for a brain

[55:22.160 --> 55:29.520]  this isn't a game government wants control of your life in a collective hell where the globalists
[55:29.520 --> 55:40.800]  are offshore and above the collective that they create now continuing with this news

[55:49.600 --> 55:57.760]  camps to be ready for occupation within 72 hours and it goes on to say that it's for displaced

[56:03.520 --> 56:07.200]  we're setting up these emergency camps for political dissidents in even though i've been to urban
[56:07.200 --> 56:12.000]  warfare drills and watched them training for that had congressional hearings the rex 84 hearings

[56:15.760 --> 56:20.000]  brooks that brought it up hey that's classified don't bring that up the miami herald reported it
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.480]  people always ask me what's my proof of this i've made whole police state films four of them
[56:24.480 --> 56:29.200]  documenting it the latest has all the info police state for it's free online for heaven's sakes
[56:30.800 --> 56:37.360]  we've got the emergency centers act that said oh the government already has old bases designated
[56:37.360 --> 56:44.160]  for collapse and housing people and political uprising civil unrest is the term and we want
[56:44.160 --> 56:49.360]  to expand this so there it is it's the old basis and then we have the biggest prison
[56:49.360 --> 56:53.760]  population in the world now six million not even per capita biggest in the world period
[56:53.760 --> 56:59.040]  bigger than communist china with 1.1 billion people we have a bigger prison population with
[56:59.040 --> 57:04.720]  310 million people living here uh six million behind bars another 10 million or so on probation
[57:04.720 --> 57:08.880]  of one type or another and people are like good we have law and order no we have one of the highest
[57:08.880 --> 57:14.560]  crime rates too because more prisons creates more crime because they're colleges of crime
[57:14.560 --> 57:20.400]  then you can't get a job once you get out of there because you've got the criminal record
[57:21.680 --> 57:27.040]  so you stay in crime it's all been actuaryed out it's all been engineered out they know exactly
[57:27.040 --> 57:31.280]  what they're doing is why they ship the drugs in and then nonviolent people use them they put
[57:31.280 --> 57:37.520]  them in the prisons then they become more hardcore criminals but here it is this is now in the uh

[1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:29.840]  humanness and i do not feel worthy to be bringing you this information i do not feel worthy to
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:36.080]  be reaching as many people as i am and i am humbled and i am thankful but i am dedicated
[1:01:36.080 --> 1:01:40.560]  i am aggressive and i am in your corner because you are in mind we're all in this together
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:45.120]  the elite are going to destroy themselves if they're successful we're even trying to save them
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:50.880]  i'm i'm way past even hating these murdering vicious control freaks uh some of their darker
[1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:58.560]  servants uh are just totally turned over to destruction and it's it's it's it's uh i i don't
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:05.040]  hate them i want to destroy them i want to shut them down i want to break them so they can't go
[1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:13.840]  on hurting people uh but it's more uh discussed see i'm beyond fear i'm beyond horror i'm beyond
[1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:20.160]  any of it i understand how things work i know the basics and if we can just get the general
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:26.880]  public to wake up to the basics which will mind blow you the basics will blow your mind the basics
[1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:34.240]  of this universe the basic laws of human activity and the secrets of human activity are so mind
[1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:41.840]  blowing like i know more about women now than i ever knew in my entire just i can't even imagine
[1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:45.920]  how much i understand women now and then i don't even care to try to even use the information
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:53.440]  that's another problem with the knowledge it is one thing to know how men operate to know how
[1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:58.400]  women operate and when you when you're conscious when you're illuminated as the illuminati calls
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:02.320]  it but they're not really illuminated they create a counter counterfeit people are probably like
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:09.440]  illuminated that's illuminati no no no no no no that's their term they call it illuminated
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:13.440]  well christ said i bring the light or you're the light of the world does that mean you're
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:19.440]  illuminati no the devil's system creates a counterfeit and i'm not even bible thumping
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:25.120]  here at you i'm talking about just general ideas of being awake and i love it when somebody walks
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:29.680]  up to me on the street and they say i'm awake or i woke up that says it all that doesn't mean
[1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:33.840]  you're believing what i believe that doesn't mean you're seeing what i see it means you yourself
[1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:39.920]  are going wow there's more than meets the eye there's a lot going on here i better start not
[1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:45.440]  just going along to get along i better start really trying to figure things out that's what
[1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:49.680]  waking up means when you're asleep you don't know where you are you're in the dark you're dreaming
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:54.960]  you're in a fantasy land when you're awake you're at least open and staring and trying to figure
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:04:04.160]  things out and being awake knowing how people work knowing what motivates people knowing knowing
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:09.520]  these secrets it's just incredible and i just want to try to teach them to people it doesn't
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:15.280]  mean i implement them doesn't mean i carry it all out does i'm not even conscious when it comes to
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:20.240]  fighting tyrant when i'm just up here i fight so hard i don't have time to craft what i say or
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:25.920]  do it it's pretty much just does what i'm telling you who i am what i'm thinking what's
[1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:34.320]  i don't i'm seeing it i am seeing it i am understanding it and i am resonating out there

[1:08:46.240 --> 1:09:04.720]  to god it's alex jones all right we are back live thank you so much for joining us here today
[1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:14.400]  it of course is tuesday the 28th day of february 2012 and i am on the road uh here today we got
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:19.200]  into our destination about midnight from driving out of orlando florida where we talked to a
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:28.320]  over capacity crowd of over uh 1100 people they never sold out that auditorium facility we were at
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:33.920]  and i really appreciate all of you coming out and helping us get out to orlando and
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:41.600]  to dallas texas i do plan uh in may or june to now do a bigger trip out west to affiliates
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:48.640]  in new mexico arizona california and then maybe utah washington state and then cut
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:55.280]  down through uh colorado back to texas i mean i might do something where i talk to six uh
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:10:01.440]  different radio affiliate audiences that also have big events the issue is i'm traveling
[1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:07.120]  this time with my family and we don't like to keep the kids up uh past uh you know midnight or so
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:13.680]  uh here on the rv so we pulled into a hotel to stay last night uh and there's too many of us
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:21.360]  really stay on the the bus or rv most nights we stayed on it some evenings and then by the time we
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:26.560]  get up in the morning and everything the kids wake up about six a.m poor richard is in there
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:31.200]  looking up the equipment we hadn't tested doing it from the bus yet and the hotel wi-fi wasn't
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:35.760]  making it through the wall uh out here in the middle of nowhere and the florida panhandle
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:40.560]  so we're out in the bus and drove to a spot to find where we had good stuff and as soon as we
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:44.960]  turned the generator off there wasn't enough power even though it says there was to run things but
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:49.920]  that's the kind of unforeseen things great job with the crew though getting us on air they set up
[1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:54.000]  a great system that has three backups but that itself is using too much power so we're just coming
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.800]  to you via the miracle of skype right now and we're beta testing this and this is the beta trip
[1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:04.560]  i think the beta trip did about a 95 i would i would have been happy if we got a b plus still we
[1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:11.440]  got right at about a a plus so just exemplary job uh to the entire info wars crew and again you the
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:16.640]  listeners and affiliates out there uh while we're testing this out and doing this but it's amazing
[1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:20.800]  to be reaching probably more than three million people over this three hour show today conservatively
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:29.440]  from a rv in the florida panhandle over skype just just incredible and it'll be even better next time
[1:11:29.440 --> 1:11:34.000]  of course if i broadcast from an affiliate almost every time out of town i could just broadcast
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:39.920]  directly from their own systems via is the inline once we do that but again this was a beta test
[1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:46.400]  from the road itself and i'll be on the road again tomorrow and then back in studio hallelujah
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:53.360]  this has been fun but i'm ready to get back to the hacienda okay uh some of the news and we're
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:59.200]  going to our guest but i'm going to cover this news after our guest has gone it probably about
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:06.880]  40 after so rights group petitions f a a on use of drones in us skies watchdogs warns that uavs
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:13.440]  increase first amendment risk for would be political dissenters ethicist argue killing newborn babies

[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:28.480]  three years old even though they're healthy the state will assess if you're going to be a good
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:34.320]  citizen and if you have value uh that goes back to a bunch of you genesis burton rustle and others
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:40.560]  bernard shaw george bernard shaw we've got video clips of that old film we played it and then
[1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:45.440]  six months later glenn beck played the exact same clips on the show which i think is great it's my my
[1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:50.720]  son glenn beck who copies everything i do which is good is getting better and better in fact he
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:55.440]  got good enough to get kicked out of fox i know the inside baseball on that so even if they kill

[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:08.000]  more of a patriot and i'm proud of my son glenn beck okay i'm serious i am a little bit of a
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.840]  joke there but he is my son and my son has done some dirty tricks to me in the past so he doesn't
[1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:18.240]  want folks to know who his father is and that's okay uh continuing people like ron paul and g
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:24.320]  edward griffin and countless others are my father in political awakening my physical father helped

[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:06.320]  you know it to be true okay continuing here i was talking to one fox news guy and they said
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:12.720]  that glenn got so mad whenever i put out that public letter open letter to glenn beck uh
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:16.880]  and said look glenn i know you're copying all my info quit twisting it he reportedly went
[1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:23.280]  into a conniption fit and through fits at fox news and said i will you know do this and that
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:29.440]  if you ever have alex jones on i was told this directly by a fox news host i'm just gonna leave
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:36.800]  it that what you don't want to know now i'm digressing i apologize we've got the uh big news
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:42.080]  coming up uh as utah moves to block the secret arrest secret imprisonment of us citizens
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:46.800]  off to the fema camps i thought there were no fema camps but they say they'll secretly arrest
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:51.280]  us and kill us if they want to but there's no camps they're not going to hold us we have the
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:56.000]  biggest present population in the world oh and of course the biggest news i talk about it so much
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:01.680]  it's kind of passe but they are going to release new york times port last friday i put a video out
[1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:05.520]  on this and people are saying it's not true okay it's not true then it's just the government admits
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:12.080]  they're going to release the weaponized airborne transmittable to human super bird flu that the
[1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:19.440]  old version if when humans could catch it it's like 65 70 or so it varies in the study percent die
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:24.640]  but the good news is humans usually can't get it you got to get it directly into your body
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:31.280]  it's not airborne but if you get it six and a half times out of 10 you're deader than a fat hammer
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:38.080]  well now they souped it up and made it airborne and they're going to release the RNA sequence
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:44.800]  and tell you how to make it but i'm an extremist for being upset about that you know if it gets out
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:50.400]  i don't know my kids will probably die get buried and the globalist all said they want to kill us
[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:55.280]  they're building bunkers and seed vaults and poisoning the water and food
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:01.200]  and talk all the time about releasing a bio weapon to kill most of us and take over what's left
[1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:05.280]  of the earth better than a neutron bomb to reduce population but i'm supposed to not be concerned
[1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:11.920]  about that i'm fair mongering you know what i'm real sorry i'm real sorry i'm real sorry i'm warning
[1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:16.560]  you even the fbi and others are freaking out over it saying do not release that do not release it
[1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:22.000]  i told the government go visit peonka who heads up the biology department at ut talking about how
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:27.520]  he wants to kill 90 of people with airborne Ebola and going it will be released soon i'm sad for my
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:33.200]  family that has to die but we need to and i'm like red alert folks he's in the biology department
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:39.840]  saying that the soon the weaponized Ebola will be released but i'm not supposed to be concerned about
[1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:47.680]  that you know what i hope that's that cooler heads prevail this stuff doesn't get released but
[1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:52.560]  they're setting up plausible deniability for all these different weaponized things to get released
[1:16:52.560 --> 1:16:57.680]  bird flu just want to the mouse pox kills over 90 of the mammals that comes in contact with some
[1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:03.360]  studies 98 99 percent now if that isn't the top story for people that really want to be concerned
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:08.400]  i love my wife i love my children i love my family and i don't want the globalists to win
[1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:16.160]  they're publishing it next week there are thousands of labs that within a month they
[1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:21.680]  estimate will be able to develop it how long until the crazy eugenesis that works at one of these
[1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:26.800]  releases it how long until it accidentally gets out all right i'm going to shut up and get our
[1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:32.880]  guest till 40 after and then i'm going to get into the fema camp news but uh i just man i tell you
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:38.160]  you idiots that laugh at me out there i know why you laugh because you're scared you see everything
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:42.560]  i talk about coming true and i'm telling you what's coming next what's the real probability i'm
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:46.800]  talking about you dying and they'll probably have some vaccine that sterilizes you or something as
[1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:50.560]  a side effect that they'll give you to save you from this then the question is are you going to
[1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:55.120]  take that and i'll have to watch the very perpetrators grandstanding as a bunch of saviors
[1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:59.200]  now let's shift gears to the so-called sodium fluoride which is a cover for a type of acid
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:03.040]  with hundreds of heavy metals and other garbage in it hundreds of bad things including multiple
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:08.720]  heavy metals be technical jeff green national director of citizens for safe drinking water
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:14.560]  in san diego where they've almost gotten it out but haven't been able to like temple florida and
[1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:18.480]  cal and areas of canada we're going to break here in about a minute and a half but tell us
[1:18:18.480 --> 1:18:22.800]  what's coming up jeff and and the success you've been able to have and where this fight is okay
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:28.960]  buddy well the thank you very much for having me on the program one of the city of san diego
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:32.800]  that you're mentioning you actually had a lot of the prohibited fluoridation since the early 1950s
[1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:38.240]  and it took a lot for them to finally try to shove it down san diego's throat and they may
[1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:43.200]  have done so for as long as two years but there's nothing yet to suggest to be able to continue
[1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:49.120]  beyond that point um so i should have added they're fighting to fluoridate there that's right
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:52.400]  it was months ago i wanted to get you on and i'd forgotten what it was about and my producer
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:56.400]  told me you were on uh so absolutely i just knew you were fighting it out there and it was a big
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:01.280]  battle well it is and the difference being is that for the longest time we were able to block it and
[1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:05.520]  for a two-year period of time now they've actually had they will have it in the water through the
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:10.800]  city of san diego but we don't believe that they'll be able to continue beyond that uh in the state
[1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:16.320]  of california more than 110 cities turned down fluoridation and so they quit trying to work with
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:21.120]  it on an individual city level and they went to the state and rushed it through and bragged about
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:26.960]  rushing it through so the people didn't have any opportunity to respond and so i'd stay there yes
[1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:33.120]  because we come back that's right that's the new attack plan new jersey california uh arkansas
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:39.920]  everywhere they're coming in and trying to have the states make you take it by law which is incredibly
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:45.200]  criminal we'll be right back with our guests straight ahead on how we can beat these eugenicist
[1:19:45.200 --> 1:19:49.440]  murderers products work for many others and so i bought a bunch of them started using them had a
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:55.360]  little bit of results but i wasn't following the regimen every day but erin dykes in my office did
[1:19:55.360 --> 1:20:01.040]  and lost more than 60 pounds when i saw those results i said i'd better follow my own advice

[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:04.800]  before the city council he's also an effective national figure educating people i've seen him
[1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:15.040]  on dr marcola's show and his reports and the issue here is that all over the united states
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:20.800]  we've educated people the fda's own scientists have come out and said it gives you bone cancer
[1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:26.160]  dental phorosis doesn't help you it's very toxic it's more than just fluoride in there it's a cover
[1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:32.320]  name for toxic waste let's get it out and their response is oh yeah we'll just pass a law making
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:37.920]  you have it because it's a giant industry that it would have to pay to store this and a eugenesis
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:42.880]  like it because it's another nasty thing to do i mean this is you're being assaulted folks and this
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:46.720]  hoax is starting to come down just like with the vaccines people aren't vaccinating now
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:50.400]  they're trying to make it to law they shoot your kids up in california without telling you
[1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:55.440]  with the garter cell and other stuff so go ahead jeff green break down the fight you've
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:25:01.760]  gotten san diego what the state's trying to do and the next level of the fight sir well actually it's
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:05.680]  all over the united states and i guess if i could just mention that there's a couple of things that
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:10.160]  should have already resolved all this when the journal american dental association the journal
[1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:15.920]  that almost all the dentists who belong to the ada you know usually get received when it came out
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:21.600]  in the in year 2000 as a cover story and told people it doesn't work when you swallow it you
[1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:26.240]  would have thought it would have gone away when the cdc and the centers for disease control most
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:30.400]  of your audience probably knows that but the centers for disease control came out with a
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:36.000]  a report that called it one of the most important things that happened the last century and uh
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:40.160]  what if you look at page four it says it doesn't there's no correlation between the amount of
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:44.000]  fluoride that's in the enamel of the tooth and whether you have tooth decay or not and that
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:48.400]  if there's not enough fluoride in the saliva they have impact so what most people think are
[1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:53.280]  are the the accurate way of going about that are the best way to go about this is to educate them
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:58.240]  or provide them the information most of the time what you get is somebody saying thanks for sharing
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:04.240]  and so what we've had to find is that there are but when someone actually uh hears about this for
[1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:09.280]  the very first time is they're almost incredulous as to how all this could be true and one of the
[1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:13.760]  questions that comes up is how could this happen if that's true how do they get by with it and the
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:19.600]  truth is they break the law they actually break the law the differences those laws or regulations
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:25.280]  that are also part of those laws are kind of wound up in a bureaucratic maze that means the average
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:32.320]  citizen can't just go running in and and shoot at it and and and have it stop and i'm glad you just
[1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:37.680]  hit the nail on the head it's criminal to forcibly medicate even with a good drug because of the
[1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:44.640]  nuremberg code common sense common law and federal law state law but to put a deadly toxic waste in
[1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:49.600]  the water mislabel it call it fluoride when it's not even that as you know right and know that
[1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:54.800]  it's doing this because because the politicians are paid off it is criminal and it's time to
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:27:00.640]  start going after them with civil lawsuits bare minimum well we actually do have a lawsuit that
[1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:06.160]  we that was filed uh this last year uh it was filed here in the federal district court down in
[1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:11.600]  san diego federal district court in southern california and it was a individuals who live in
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:17.120]  the san diego county region of california uh actually it's uh southern california and it was
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:22.000]  filed against mech upon water district of southern california that delivers something like water
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:27.840]  to something like something 17 million uh million people and what the claim was is not the fluoride
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:32.880]  spat despite that's what most people wanted to talk about instead it was that they knowingly
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:37.520]  added a substance that has never been approved for the claims that they've been making and that they
[1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:43.680]  did it uh you know without anybody's consent and then they've taken this hydrofluosalic acid which
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:48.320]  is hard for most people to say but in fact they took this particular substance they weren't compelled
[1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:52.160]  by the state to do it they did it on their own and they basically have been shoving it on down
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:56.800]  everybody's throat so this particular lawsuit has gone through the complaint cycle it's gone
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:02.720]  through what is normal would be the mitzvah water district basically having a motion to dismiss
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:08.800]  we oppose that then they reply and we were supposed to actually hear to hear oral arguments on it as
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:15.200]  of january 26th the judge has the option to not do that and to hold off for a while we haven't
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:19.680]  had an answer back for it but you know we've anticipated in many cases that if you're in
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:22.560]  the lower court that you're still going to have to go to the appellate court and we're
[1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:26.800]  prepared to go all the way with this but it's very narrowly focused it's focused on the fact that
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:31.920]  they have uh you know practiced the deceptive business practices by not telling everybody
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:36.960]  that none of this stuff has ever been approved for anybody and that in secondarily that that
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:42.080]  they're adding an unapproved drug to the water without without our consent and so that's the
[1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:47.760]  primary aspect of the case to go directly to what you're talking about no and i think it's also good
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:53.040]  to launch more torpedoes i mean others can do it you've done your job and to sue city council people
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:57.600]  who are getting campaign money you can go get their filings find out where they got it when
[1:28:57.600 --> 1:29:03.200]  they've gotten money from the phosphate and industry you can also go after them for deception
[1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:08.960]  you can also go after them basically for bribes you can go after them for the fact that they're
[1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:15.040]  uh engaged in fraud putting a toxic chemical in your water for political campaign contributions
[1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:19.680]  and even if they survive the lawsuit it'll force it into the news i mean it's i mean look
[1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:24.880]  they're assaulting us with chemical weapons we will assault them with lawsuits and it
[1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:29.120]  we'll be right back mr green you're doing an incredible job we're gonna learn more how we

[1:33:21.440 --> 1:33:26.160]  hardcore scientific killers that think we're so stupid we'll just pay attention to football and
[1:33:26.160 --> 1:33:30.960]  baseball and fashion and not care about the gmo designed to sterilize us or the deadly
[1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:37.200]  sodium fluoride we're being assaulted the cancer rates are up over 2 000 on average i got a lot
[1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:45.200]  of friends and family that have dead or dying and i'm mad about it i don't like it you understand
[1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:52.640]  that i take it personal they didn't screw me up they didn't screw me up you know i've no neighbors
[1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:58.720]  and stuff that have caught you know years ago kids in their garage stealing beer or whatever
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:05.440]  like i i've got one quasi acquaintance i've known him off and on for years who caught a teenager
[1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:10.560]  and they're stealing didn't have a gun on him and beat the guy to a pulp and police came and he
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:15.040]  didn't get in trouble for it it's his right to do it but i mean i'll be honest if i catch somebody
[1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:18.880]  stealing a lawnmower or something running off with it i'm probably not going to stomp them
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:23.840]  i'm gonna say hey that's you know you know that's mine and then if they bow up or something you
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:28.960]  know the point is it's not worth the danger i don't get mad at him now you come to my house
[1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:33.200]  i'm gonna kill you because that's your home invading now my point is i'm not gonna get mad
[1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:37.760]  over neighbors dog going to the bathroom or something like i've seen neighbors years ago
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:42.720]  that's why i moved to the country getting arguments with each other over their dog going in their
[1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:47.200]  you know yard or people parking in their parking space and apartments i actually
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:52.000]  heard about a fight between a guy i knew and some other guy back when i lived in an apartment
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:57.120]  like 12 years ago uh and the cops came and everything i was told there was blood everywhere
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:35:00.960]  i just knew that i saw you know blood and stuff on the ground and heard about it from the neighbors
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:06.160]  the point is you all know the those stories oh if you parked in my parking space stop doing it
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:12.240]  hey man don't bow up to me you got a problem let's go i mean what are you so what if somebody
[1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:16.560]  parks in your parking space i mean go over and say something to them they bow up to you okay
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:22.240]  whatever i'll just start parking in yours okay you want to be a punk you know i mean that's
[1:35:22.240 --> 1:35:26.880]  that's the way i am and then i guess if somebody got in my face and hits me i'll get in a fight with
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:34.240]  them but somebody's trying to poison my kids and me man i mean i'm mad i mean i'm i'm angry i mean
[1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:39.760]  i'm i'm in the mode to pull somebody's head off but i'm gonna physically fight them because
[1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:45.120]  that's how we do it the 21st century but i'm gonna savagely call them out and i'm going to try to
[1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:50.720]  activate the same survival instincts that i know you've got that i've got let me tell you something
[1:35:50.720 --> 1:35:55.280]  there's unlimited energy in survival there's unlimited energy and taking stuff personal
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:36:01.440]  there's unlimited energy in getting focused and getting angry and taking action like
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:05.520]  jeff grange doing i want him to give out any websites so people can duplicate what he's done
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:11.680]  they've successfully for years blocked fluoride being added to 16 million people uh because that's
[1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:15.600]  san diego pumps out to everybody in that whole area they're in orange county and the rest of it
[1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:21.440]  the most popular area of the country after Manhattan and uh they're close to getting it out now for
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:26.160]  two years the feds came in with the state spent millions i'm going for memory he can correct me
[1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:32.640]  but getting it in there and now in other places in in canada uh in in states like new jersey
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:36.960]  in arkansas they've they've passed laws last year saying we're gonna floridae now they're
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:40.880]  coming in and saying parents you need to give your kids fluoride tablets if you're on a well
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:47.120]  there's fluoride baby water everywhere they know we're waking up so their answer to hide this criminal
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:52.240]  hoax is to just get more in our face just like the vaccine makers a do you agree with that statement
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:56.800]  jeff uh that there is i would like to change some of the facts that you have a part of it
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:02.400]  probably more importantly uh we have ways to stop this and part of it is to take that anger and
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:06.320]  injustice which you experience and i experience and we both know it's not just the fluoride it's
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:13.360]  that all of these intrusions that place you in peril and to basically shift that uh in this
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:18.160]  particular issue instead of because what they want us to do is to fight about it because what that
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:22.480]  does is allow them to just call people's name and try to characterize it and so forth and so if
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:27.040]  you're small enough community you can overwhelm that you can do through your own personal presence
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:31.920]  and you can spend the time and energy but when you've got the media working against you unfortunately
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:36.400]  the people's minds you have to change unfortunately aren't listening to you most of the time so we've
[1:37:36.400 --> 1:37:42.160]  actually found ways to be able to guide people through so that you can we can actually focus
[1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:49.120]  on accountability on full disclosure you know transparency compliance with all the laws and
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:52.960]  you know in conformance with already established standards and what we find out is we already
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:58.560]  have things in our favor that will allow us to stop this let me stop you again let me stop you
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:06.320]  then give me the floor they tried to pass a law uh last year to not let the tsa grope people sexually
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:10.720]  in the airport and then finally some state reps went wait a minute it's already against the law
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:15.360]  that's why the state police and fbi can't do this how are you doing this well they created a new
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:20.480]  agency and just gave them executive authority that doesn't stand up to do it so we don't need
[1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:25.840]  another law just enforce the regular laws that are there go ahead well you're exactly right and
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:30.320]  like i said before what happens is we have this bureaucratic maze that exists all across the country
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:34.880]  which basically prevents the average citizen from being able to get through it so what we actually
[1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:39.680]  do is show people here's how you can do that here's how you peel back the layers if you try to do it
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:43.840]  all at one time it's it's kind of like you know the guy with the rifle charging up the hill and
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:49.440]  you wonder why you got shot you know you have to we have them surrounded they actually we know
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:53.840]  that they're not on the right we have too many people who know what's going on but as long as we
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:58.880]  we run in to get them instead of realizing well how do we pull this apart and so i'm happy for
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:04.080]  people to call me and uh and talk to me we can actually look at you know formalizing basically
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:09.680]  uh you know very unique situation for their particular community so that you can you can
[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:14.000]  peel these things back and force it so that you no longer have this interference with you getting
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:18.880]  the best drinking water available and you and you know alex as well as anything this is you know the
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:22.640]  the forwardation angle is just the tip of the spear it's somebody that knows that it was wrong
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:26.880]  from the very beginning and as long as they keep on calling it the greatest thing in the world
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:30.560]  you're supposed to continue forward with it it's just the tip of the spear of all these things
[1:39:30.560 --> 1:39:37.200]  you're right because if you can prove that they know that say the h1n1 vaccine didn't protect you
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:41.840]  and doubles your chances of getting the regular flu major government studies of canada and the us
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:46.320]  and then and then the companies know it's a hoax if you could show them that
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:49.520]  it was the end of world war two the people really trusted the government for the first
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:53.200]  time in us history we were the good guys and they said hey we're going to put this in your water
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:59.280]  to help your teeth and folks are like yeah but some people said no it's you know it's going to
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:03.920]  dump the public down it was used in the camps they're like oh shut up conspiracy theorist
[1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:09.040]  and now here we are all these years later and we've seen the health effects of it the awakening is
[1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:14.720]  here and i've studied the different cities depending on what company they buy it from
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:20.880]  i was i looked up like two years ago from insiders uh what was in missouri sent me the
[1:40:20.880 --> 1:40:27.920]  data sheet on it the the so-called fluoride they were buying from china had over 300 chemicals in
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:32.720]  them and it was just pure toxic waste and they called it fluoride and as you pointed out even
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:38.160]  the so-called pure fluoride isn't even fluoride uh talk a little bit about what we know they're
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:42.880]  putting in under the name fluoride and some of the health effects that we know about i mean i know
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:46.560]  you're going at the basics that it's illegal to do this and then i want you to speak to the fact
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:51.840]  because i know you've seen it fox news you know is saying oh maybe lithium needs to be in the water
[1:40:51.840 --> 1:40:56.880]  the japanese government's saying another toxic heavy metal because your battle cut down on suicide
[1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:01.680]  and oh we want to put statins in the water you know even kids need them which they admit basically
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:06.640]  we're that's part of that's been been out now and of course if we had applied any what we call
[1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:11.280]  criteria or standards you know that basically we'd have to do with any we put in the water
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:14.880]  none of these things would survive because you'd ask for them to take the burden of
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:21.600]  accountability on it so what this is actually part of how we've been able to affect in an area
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:27.360]  that i'd say has been florida for 40 or 50 years and realize that that place doesn't the public policy
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:31.920]  has been supported by the courts the courts are basically even though i don't agree with it they
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:37.520]  basically said that the public policy is a legitimate government interest to reduce harm to people the
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:42.160]  difference being is is that you now get down to what shows up in the truck and what you're exactly
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:48.880]  what you're talking about the actual substance is typically hydrofluosalic acid and this hydrofluosalic
[1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:56.480]  acid is not present in nature by itself it's it's created by pouring sulfuric acid over the ore
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:03.040]  that in the phosphate mines it creates a gas and this gas they spray water down on top of it and
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:08.880]  capture it and they now have this slurry of chemicals they have arsenic and lead and cadmium
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:15.760]  and mercury and and to a certain extent radio nuclides they they actually have a whole series of
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:19.920]  not because they were added but because they were part of the ore in the first place now the amazing
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:25.520]  part is the reason why they had to had to actually pour the sulfuric acid over the ore and separate
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:31.600]  it out is because normal plants would not be able to use the phosphate as fertilizer if it had fluoride
[1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:36.880]  with it because most plants will not take it up through the root system and so because of that
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:42.640]  they're actually they're actually taking this substance that plants won't take and and and and
[1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:48.720]  now separating it and then shipping it out to everybody and the amazing part is in 1988 the
[1:42:48.720 --> 1:42:54.960]  US EPA gave up all oversight of direct water additives and most people think EPAs you know it
[1:42:54.960 --> 1:43:01.760]  would be controlling that they gave it all up yeah let's be clear the the the EPA last year without
[1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:08.800]  law started putting 1,000 to 5,000 dollar fines per infraction and after the third infraction
[1:43:08.800 --> 1:43:15.600]  they could adjudicate 1 million dollar fines look it up on hay dust and began sending agents out
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:21.040]  without warrants with meters just like when a cop pulled me over and did a meter on light on my
[1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:27.440]  window tent and said oh i guess it isn't too dark you can go uh they have meters with a little light
[1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:34.000]  they shoot from point to point this is on record i've seen it on the news and boom if there's hay
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:41.920]  dust in your barn bam osha finds oh hay dust hay dust grass dust right now of course there's dust
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:46.880]  in a barn i've i believe me i've loaded a lot of hay up into the loft the point is it's to shut down
[1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:53.200]  small business meanwhile there's no regulation over water additives and so it's the biggest joke
[1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:57.520]  i want to explain this again i've done reports i've done videos you can go to info wars.com
[1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:02.720]  and just type in fluoride from china we did a whole report song i was told about it by insiders and
[1:44:02.720 --> 1:44:08.160]  did a search found articles on it i was told by family actually in east texas that runs a water
[1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:13.040]  department in a small town and they uh well i'm not going to get them in trouble let's just say a
[1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:18.160]  lot of water departments go the city may be paying for this we're we're just going to get rid of it
[1:44:18.160 --> 1:44:22.000]  the problem is they put it in a field it'll kill the whole field they can't dump it in a creek it'll
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:26.880]  kill everything but i'm gonna just shut up i'm gonna stop right there the point is there's a
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:30.800]  bunch of water department people that are quietly just getting rid of the floor out on the side
[1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:35.280]  because they know and have read it and on there most of it now is a lot of it's from china a lot
[1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:39.760]  of it's from florida but the stuff from china you think they're just putting melamine in the milk
[1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:44.640]  you think they're just putting lead in the toys folks their worst toxic waste mercury lead arsenic
[1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:49.520]  and radioactive isotopes and see i've been talking about this now for years and people get their
[1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:53.760]  local news to cover it you put a geiger counter on the city pipes it's radioactive and they go we
[1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:58.160]  don't know where it's coming from must be the lake terrorists must have put radiation in there and
[1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:05.680]  i'm like no your city got caught it's the additive it's the residue radiation is not good for your
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:10.640]  teeth i'm sorry sir go ahead i'm ranting it's just this is so incredible this is so off the
[1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:16.480]  charts we've got to warn people but in fact what happens is the promoters of florida would say that
[1:45:16.480 --> 1:45:20.640]  it's all certified but what they forget to mention to anybody is that it's never batch tested meaning
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:25.520]  that they may have a certification even one time a year and most of us aren't too happy about thinking
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:30.000]  what kind of certification took place over in china but in any case they're not certified for
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:35.680]  what shows up in the truck they just basically say yeah we've been certified one time a year so
[1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:41.200]  you know a large part of the way that we've been able to basically address this is to make
[1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:44.480]  sure we get down to exactly what you're talking about and we're dealing specifically with a
[1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:49.200]  product and making certain that someone becomes accountable for it well guess what nobody wants
[1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:53.680]  to raise their hand and i'd be happy if i i know you have a short time today if uh if you want to
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:45:57.200]  give out my email or something like that or telephone number i'm happy to take call absolutely
[1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:00.720]  we're just going to get you on for one or two segments but i wanted to have basically banner
[1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:05.360]  for the whole hour now if you've got time yeah give me the best websites you think to look at
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:09.600]  your email for folks that want to link up with you i think one of the most articulate focused
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:14.640]  professional guys on this subject but i mean you know if you were in soviet russia where on record
[1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:18.560]  they put flora in the water that was even in the nuremberg trials where the nazis learned about it
[1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:24.080]  to to to make people's today if you were there if you worked in an orphanage and they told you to
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:29.600]  put poison in the kids milk how about you just dump the milk in the in the trash can and say
[1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:34.400]  you're poisoning the kids you know if you don't have the courage to speak out it's time for water
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:38.560]  department people i know a lot of them are waking up and going to the city and saying take it out
[1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:42.560]  but the lobbyists come because and give them a little bit of money because the city's paying
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:48.160]  millions on average for the poison but i mean how about at least you just throw it in the landfill
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:52.800]  how about i mean i'm telling folks that work at water districts it's poison you know it's poison
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:58.160]  you know the insert on it says if you if you ate a gram of this it would kill you then why are you
[1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:03.280]  putting it in the water sending it to your family downstream and everybody else it's time for people
[1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:08.160]  to not just sue i think it's good to sue good to be focused good to be calm but i think it's also
[1:47:08.160 --> 1:47:14.160]  good to run around like a chicken with your head cut off that's very effective uh mr green to wake
[1:47:14.160 --> 1:47:19.520]  people up out of their trance all of us are attacking on different fronts in different ways
[1:47:19.520 --> 1:47:24.240]  because this is run around like a chicken with your head cut off issue uh when they're putting
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:32.400]  lead mercury radon uranium plutonium uh radioactive particles in there as well and and after a water
[1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:37.760]  district's been doing it for 10 years local news checked into what i said and put geiger counters
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:43.760]  on the water department pipes and it's you know 50 times in one newscast over what it's supposed to
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:48.720]  be the geiger counters pegging but then the news isn't allowed to say it's the fluoride they run
[1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:54.640]  around bumbling saying we don't know why i mean this do you see the level of the hoax i'm talking
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:58.960]  about here sir well i certainly do and in fact that's one of the reasons why we have to pierce
[1:47:58.960 --> 1:48:03.680]  through it because uh you know you have to we have to recognize that the media played a large role
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:08.960]  they would rather describe that he said she said and and i'm in one thing that you'll see and you'll
[1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:12.640]  see this with other issues that i'm certain that you've covered because i've watched your or listened
[1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:17.600]  to your program as before that what'll happen is is that they you know in a piece that supposedly is
[1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:22.560]  a report or that is news they will state that you know the fluoride is put in the water because
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:26.720]  it reduces tooth decay it's been proven to do that but these people claim that it's harmful
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:32.560]  i mean that's not news that's their opinion you know going out there and selling this themselves
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:39.840]  that's what we're all up against basically so i have a telephone number 800 728 3833
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:44.400]  that people are welcome to call me on and i can help guide them through certain issues
[1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:48.560]  i have an email that they can do where i can send them specific documents depending upon
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:52.800]  what state that they're in that may be helpful and uh that's an easy one it's just my name
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:49:03.920]  it would reverse but green jeff g-r-e-n-j-e-f-f at cox at cox.net and i would be happy to talk
[1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:07.600]  with people because there are ways for us to do it you have to be a little bit more disciplined
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:12.960]  but it really is something if we don't stand up for this i'm sorry it's just like you said before
[1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:16.880]  alex said before you're looking at statin drugs or lithium or other things can be placed in the
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:23.520]  water too and of course they always make jokes in in national publications southern probably
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:30.320]  law center and others alex jones thinks fluoride's bad and he thinks they want to put drugs to
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:39.920]  control our minds meanwhile ap fox cnn japanese tv they're going oh we should put lithium in
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:46.080]  oh we should put statins in oh we should uh certify embryos beforehand to make sure there's
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:52.640]  not aggressive genes in them i mean they're just total nanny state of total control coming down
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:59.120]  on us uh jeff in closing where is the fight going right now what can we do around the country to
[1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:03.600]  fight back against states that are trying to pass laws now saying you know before they just
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:08.160]  snuck it in now they're like it's the law you will do this well here's the part to remember is by the
[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:13.280]  time it gets to a city council meeting and i i'm sorry what this sounds like but whether it's a
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:19.600]  city council meeting or it's a state legislature by the time the decisions have already been made
[1:50:20.480 --> 1:50:24.080]  you know they've already made those decisions that you know these are dog and pony shows when
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:29.920]  you get there so that the opportunity is contact with people who are in the community that are
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:34.320]  likeminded you get in contact with people like myself or other people that are involved in
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.720]  you prepare for it because the truth is you can block this so you can stop them from putting
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:42.960]  it in the water i want to hear how you do that let's do one more segment we'll be right back
[1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:49.200]  info wars dot com a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why even

[1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:31.840]  i was rediscovering some of that music on this road trip uh we listened to it on the ipad so
[1:54:31.840 --> 1:54:36.880]  so politically aware from like the 80s with deep understanding there's folks out there that know
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:41.440]  exactly what's going on it's just they've got to speak out they've got to be involved by the way
[1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:49.520]  i talked to david mustain this morning he's been trying to get ahold of me for um weeks and i just
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:56.000]  i'm i'm out of control i don't even call charlie sheen back when he calls me stuff i just am so
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:00.960]  obsessed with news and information uh but i really like david mustain and he said he did not endorse
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:06.080]  santorum he was just offhandedly saying i like this guy i like that guy i like ron paul but then he
[1:55:06.080 --> 1:55:12.000]  says stuff that doesn't make sense i like santorum on the christian issues side issue david mustain
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:15.840]  said well i already put a press release out you know he would have basically said all this on my
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:20.880]  show first but i never got the message and he said no i did not endorse santorum but he's invited
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:25.200]  me over to the concert and stuff when he's in austin next week and and more i'll just leave it at
[1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:30.560]  that so look for some surprises he was going to get out to town a few months ago and then i had some
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:36.960]  stuff that came up and so i couldn't couldn't host him but he is coming to town coming to stay
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:41.760]  over at my house that should be interesting you can't make up that level of the uh wildness the
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:48.560]  combo of alex jones david mustain um not name dropping it's just that that is that is interesting
[1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:53.680]  i haven't plugged books videos dvds nothing in over two hours i'm losing money on this trip
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:56.720]  by the way because i'm giving half the profits radio stations i won't be able to do that next
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:02.240]  time it just i can't lose money and keep operating but be sure and buy the books the dvds the materials
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:06.960]  the present planet of tv memberships if you believe in this info and it's platform for activists
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:13.680]  and fighters that we you know use it as a jump point for others to build them up and uh inform
[1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:23.600]  others okay uh let's uh go ahead and um go back to our guest uh jeff green uh really an articulate
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:28.400]  gentleman really valiantly fighting the forced poisoning of the public not even forced medicating
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:32.160]  uh national director of citizens for safe drinking water we got a minute or two three
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:36.240]  minutes left here i wanted to let you take us out of this hour erin dice is coming up a city
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:41.840]  shean and i'll also be popping in um i've got to go get packed we keep getting our destinations
[1:56:41.840 --> 1:56:46.720]  at like midnight so i've got to go get packed to get back on the bus just so i can get to where
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:50.480]  the next place we're going by like midnight so i can get home early tomorrow earlier tomorrow
[1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:55.760]  uh and so i probably will call in on my own show once any shean comes on so i got a few
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:57:00.400]  questions for her as well but erin dice coming up uh just take us out how how can you block it
[1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:05.120]  before they put the poison in because now they're coming in trying to actually make it the law well
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:09.440]  in in fact is whether they've already put it in or they're where they're going to put it in we
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:13.360]  have to recognize the one that this is not an educational game and that's the hardest part
[1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:17.920]  for most of us almost every one of us started out thinking that if we could if we could educate
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:22.160]  if we could tell if they knew what we knew they wouldn't be doing this and then you find out
[1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:27.600]  that's not true at all that this is a power game it's about control it's about power and in fact
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:33.520]  you have to understand what power you have to affect this and as long as we're begging them or
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:37.760]  you know somehow or other trying to cajole them into thinking that they're doing the right thing
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:42.000]  you know anytime you're in a water system where someone's decided they're going to put something
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:46.480]  in there and doesn't realize you can't control dosage unless you control how much water somebody
[1:57:46.480 --> 1:57:51.760]  drinks you know you don't have somebody that is that is smart enough to be your representative
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:55.680]  so the real question then is do you throw them all out well I mean gosh it's all
[1:57:55.680 --> 1:58:01.120]  happening all across the united states or do you find ways to be able to to force them to engage
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:06.080]  right now anybody who is basically what we call a legislative person a person who's been elected
[1:58:06.080 --> 1:58:11.680]  they have certain protections it says they get to rely on experts and what we found is that

[2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:56.080]  the irs is now coming after her and she's publicly said she's protesting not paying the income tax
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:03:01.120]  we didn't have the income tax till 1913 it's paid the private fellow reserve the average public

[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:39.040]  sidle up get in control the system and do that as we go out to break again i barely spent any time
[2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:43.280]  the last two hours and i got to put gas in the tank literally and figuratively we're trying to grow
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:47.840]  the crew we're trying to put out more news packages more information we're trying to respond
[2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:53.920]  in fact i even tried earlier i had darren mcbrain in here in studio with me i was asking
[2:03:53.920 --> 2:03:57.680]  about some of the great news packages he did last week that i know i never played here on air
[2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:05.040]  i'm proud to have some synergy where i air the nightly news pieces on the radio show but i've
[2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:09.920]  learned in a culture when it's not called a corporate it's always hard to get something new
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:14.560]  done and then once you're able to do it because there's there's packages every night there are two
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:19.120]  three minutes long that subscribers see but the general public never hears or sees here on the
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:24.880]  radio and i will take the great work of our reporters and i will air it but there is a
[2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:30.960]  a factor the globalist know and human training that once they get you set in your ways it's
[2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:35.200]  almost impossible to get you out of it we will start airing all these packages here it will
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:38.560]  happen in fact here in the break i'm gonna find out what some of the packages were that i tried
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:43.440]  to find out earlier and i'm going to air them nothing's going to stop me unless god wants to
[2:04:44.400 --> 2:04:49.760]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:55.200]  size meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the
[2:04:55.200 --> 2:04:59.840]  soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized world are
[2:04:59.840 --> 2:05:05.840]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies
[2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:12.240]  need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best vitamin

[2:08:03.840 --> 2:08:12.400]  by the way rosalyn peters a geoengineering expert who's gotten so many documents it
[2:08:12.400 --> 2:08:17.920]  blows my mind that we interviewed her on the news uh what's friday and i'm gonna air that tomorrow
[2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:23.520]  here on the radio because it's a 10 minute piece and she breaks down evidence she's gotten evidence
[2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:28.720]  of them trying to artificially melt the Arctic so they can then blame humans for global warming
[2:08:28.720 --> 2:08:35.680]  and have it as a pretext to take our rights but also as an added little goody that will
[2:08:35.680 --> 2:08:40.480]  allow the oil companies to go in and exploit it to melt down uh you know many of those coastal
[2:08:40.480 --> 2:08:45.200]  areas at least and we know there's geoengineering going on it's just the details are classified
[2:08:45.200 --> 2:08:49.680]  so that's big in fact i want to get her maybe later in the week or next week on uh the show to
[2:08:49.680 --> 2:08:54.480]  break that down that is big news when we carry uh the film what in the world are they spraying by

[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:17.040]  up maybe early mid-summer i'm not sure yet but a big fat juicy um a rotting trip because
[2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:22.400]  because things are getting so bad things are falling apart so quickly uh that who knows in
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:25.840]  the future of all you'll be able to drive around the country and they're already federalizing
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:31.280]  everything checkpoints uh hands down the pants at the airports tsa on the highways i mean this is
[2:10:31.280 --> 2:10:35.200]  one of the last times they'll see the info warriors as america goes dark and shuts down
[2:10:35.200 --> 2:10:38.960]  we're trying to stop that and everything we're seeing is coming true they're like okay they're
[2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:42.800]  going to secretly arrest and kill people in our building camps you're still a cook and they are
[2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:48.240]  going to release a super flu blueprint so anybody can create it and kill billions but so that's not
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:54.320]  a big deal so uh fear monger uh erin uh you now take over the transmission sydney sheen's coming
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:58.560]  up but you've got the floor my friend what briefly though what do you think of orlando and dallas
[2:10:58.560 --> 2:11:03.040]  i mean am i hyping that this was amazing the energy was so incredible oh it's very energetic and
[2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:07.120]  that's the very point i was going to make uh i get way too much credit alex i don't know why you
[2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:11.840]  always throw it to me but uh yeah people come out and i hope those are the same people out there
[2:11:11.840 --> 2:11:17.520]  being activists and so many more at other spots across the country but the enthusiasm was literally
[2:11:17.520 --> 2:11:22.720]  palpable it was tangible and uh that's a great thing and of course we've done so much that it's
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:28.720]  obvious now uh what the problems are and people just have to respond to them to have like an elvis
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:33.760]  deal women especially trying to jump over the thing at me i mean it's really getting crazy
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:40.320]  coax this is about the info war and i'll tell you erin why i build you and mcbrain and john and the
[2:11:40.320 --> 2:11:46.320]  whole crew up because you guys are doing the research you're seeing the same info you've got

[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:59.040]  videos about the great alex jones okay it is about other leaders in this fight sure i'm obnoxious
[2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:03.440]  sure i'm so chomping at the bit to fight globalist i'm you know jumping in and running and raving
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:08.240]  because i'm here to build up ron paul i'm here to build up erin dykes i'm here to build up gebra
[2:12:08.240 --> 2:12:13.280]  griffin i'm here to build up erin russo i'm i'm bringing a lot of times old timers to bigger
[2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:18.320]  audiences than they've ever seen i'm bringing people that are new to audiences that they would
[2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:22.800]  have never seen i'm bringing activists on the stage that are having victories to audiences they would
[2:12:22.800 --> 2:12:27.840]  have never even imagined being able to reach because this is a blessing that we've got and i'm
[2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:32.800]  thankful for it and i realize every day we're on air is an incredible blessing now i'm kind of like
[2:12:32.800 --> 2:12:38.800]  senna great movie by the way it's now on netflix true story you know the uh formula one racer
[2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:44.160]  uh who would overdo it sometimes it'd be so far ahead that he'd blow an engine or wouldn't pull in
[2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:49.360]  to get his tires replaced and would wreck i've got to learn and mature how to back off but i told
[2:12:49.360 --> 2:12:57.280]  people on the speech it's not arrogance it's not bravada it's not uh it's not ego that i'm so aggressive
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:13:04.880]  and loud it is anger it is frustration it is rage it is focus it is it is and and so i'm i'm i'm
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:10.000]  trying to cool off here i bet the point is that's why i'm trying to build up other people erin who
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:15.200]  are doing great jobs in their own way and and the entire crew up there is absolutely kicking
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:20.720]  butt and i want the crew to realize that this is a mission we're on this is a big deal i want the
[2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:26.320]  listeners to understand this we know we may not be here in the future we may get shut down things
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:31.040]  are going dark erin this new world order is real this global government's real what's happening
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:36.320]  is real and we better use the internet and talk radio while we've still got it and fight to keep
[2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:43.200]  it free but both we better understand that this is important it's all happening it's real our worst
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:48.480]  analysis has been confirmed in spades in triplicate erin i'm going to get out of here i'll keep ranting
[2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:52.880]  i gotta go get packed or i'll never get down the road in time we're learning a lot on this trip
[2:13:52.880 --> 2:13:57.280]  again great job to the entire crew and the whole audience but erin i'm going to let you take it

[2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:15.840]  kinds of things coming up including the secret media war of 2012 and what you're talking about
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:22.000]  is true especially in the sense that it's not about anyone focal point ron paul alex jones whatever
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:27.040]  it's the fact that once you begin to see in that they live metaphor kind of way there's no turning
[2:14:27.040 --> 2:14:31.280]  back alex and that's why they're in so much trouble that's why you've got the president i'm letting
[2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:37.040]  you go good job folks i'll be listening uh on my iphone free iphone app and i might call in during
[2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:42.880]  the sheen stuff god bless you god bless alex travel safe uh but you've got the reporters talking
[2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:48.800]  about how their whole phony establishment is coming down and ron paul's a direct threat to that uh this
[2:14:48.800 --> 2:14:53.600]  article beginning with the quote see this room two-thirds of us will be laid off when ron paul's
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:59.120]  president a hot microphone picked up a reporter attacking ron paul recently before a pentagon
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:04.160]  briefing began and it's just illustrative of the fact that you can't put hoppy dumpy back together
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:10.160]  again all the king's horses all the king's men all the liars for this empire all the deceivers all
[2:15:10.160 --> 2:15:16.800]  the people setting up the false paradigms all this entire system of hopsons choices of false
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:23.040]  choices uh people uh it's you can't go back to seeing it any other way and that's why there's
[2:15:23.040 --> 2:15:28.080]  so many enthusiastic people out there and if they will just activate and turn to their friends their
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:33.280]  family people who don't believe those are uh one foot in and one foot out those are who are on the
[2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:39.920]  fence we're going to win this thing because we do have truth on the side and you just can't see it
[2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:45.600]  any other way once you realize what a grand deception all of this is politics just being one
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:50.000]  slice one sector of it and you've seen them throwing out all the stops that wasn't enough
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:54.800]  just to black out ron paul uh or cheat him in the election they've got to try to sabotage
[2:15:55.440 --> 2:16:00.480]  everything he stands for because they know it's so much more than the electability of ron paul
[2:16:00.480 --> 2:16:05.520]  whatever ends up happening with the actual election cycle there is a revolution underway
[2:16:05.520 --> 2:16:11.360]  of ideas and that is what the system is most afraid of in my view uh of course you've got other
[2:16:11.360 --> 2:16:18.400]  stuff here warren buffett uh who's begged quote unquote the system to tax billionaires and millionaires
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:24.400]  more than they have uh another hobson's choice is out today in bloomberg talking about how the banks
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:31.520]  were the ones victimized by excesses of ousted homeowners and how uh many people who foreclose
[2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:37.680]  actually picked up a lot of cash uh implying that they did something uh deceptive and exploitative
[2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:44.240]  uh that's ridiculous because we know how much the system has set this entire thing up uh goldman
[2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:50.080]  sacks who warren buffett has backed publicly uh just one of the companies who bet against the
[2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:55.520]  own the systems in place uh who are trying to backstop all this betting against aig
[2:16:56.080 --> 2:17:00.640]  and uh manipulating so many other markets and i'm going to tell you i'm not going to forget
[2:17:00.640 --> 2:17:05.520]  about the fact i was there in 2006 the first time i was at a builder berg meeting didn't
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:09.360]  even know totally what to make out of it but i began studying the list and listening to what
[2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:14.640]  all the experts there said and uh what came out of the meeting didn't know if it was going to be true
[2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:18.880]  but it came out of that meeting in 2006 that they were going to pop the housing bubble
[2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:25.360]  and begin the economic crash nobody knew for another two years uh till well a year and a half
[2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:32.400]  till 2007 leading into 2008 that that crash was indeed upon us uh but look that information proved
[2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:37.280]  to be accurate so has a lot of other insider information that experts like jim tucker the
[2:17:37.280 --> 2:17:42.240]  veteran bill de berg sleuth uh daniel usher and others have gotten out of those meetings and now
[2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:48.160]  you see it here people like warren buffett uh again backing goldman sacks backing bank of america
[2:17:48.160 --> 2:17:53.040]  and backing the banking system in general and telling us again that the victims uh the people
[2:17:53.040 --> 2:17:58.560]  out of homes in this nation are the ones to blame when the system knowingly fraudulently
[2:17:58.560 --> 2:18:03.920]  raided their loans is triple a uh got them into loans they knew they couldn't pay back just to
[2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:08.960]  build up the system and make money on both sides of it as it goes up and down just disgusting
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:16.320]  and i know alex has already covered the ethicist arguing to kill newborn babies and how it should
[2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:21.360]  be allowed to have infanticide up to the second or even third year but it's just too shocking
[2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:27.120]  not to comment on and this whole crew of bioethicists what another false choice what another grand
[2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:33.760]  deception of people who uh you've got julian salvescu who's argued that we should put lithium in the
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:38.000]  water i know alex talked about this too other bioethicists saying we should put lithium in the
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:44.320]  water it's just another name they spun for these eugenicists who want to sell us on the idea of
[2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:52.000]  killing humanity and it's it's strange now i want to ask cindy shehan coming up not only about her
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:58.800]  own situation with the irs coming after her for not paying taxes she says she has openly
[2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:04.720]  declared she won't support the empire and that's why she's not paying taxes but i want to ask her
[2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:11.920]  about people like michael moore who's built his entire image on being anti-war about trying to
[2:19:11.920 --> 2:19:17.840]  reign in the same empire that we're all against and yet he continues to just back obama won't say
[2:19:17.840 --> 2:19:23.920]  a word about ron paul the only true anti-war candidate anywhere near the race uh now doing
[2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:30.640]  shenanigans along with other top democrats to prop up rick santorum and prolong the gop vote
[2:19:30.640 --> 2:19:36.240]  thinking it will benefit obama we'll get into that and more cindy shehan joining us on the other side
[2:19:36.240 --> 2:19:43.680]  and we'll be back by maren dyke sitting in alex jones uh maybe calling back in as well stay tuned

[2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:30.800]  she really became emblematic as far back as 2004 and 2005 after her son kasey was killed in action
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:37.120]  in iraq and uh really has spoken out ever since against the war and it's very interesting to
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:43.440]  also track how as obama came into office so many other uh anti-war activists fell off were not to
[2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:49.360]  be heard from as they quietly allowed obama to continue these wars but not cindy shehan so we're
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:55.760]  going to talk to her about that and so many other issues as the irs now comes after her for not paying
[2:24:55.760 --> 2:25:01.920]  back taxes uh headline new american anti-war activist cindy shehan refuses to pay taxes
[2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:08.400]  kurt nimo's headline fed sick irs attack dog on anti-war activist cindy shehan cindy shehan
[2:25:08.400 --> 2:25:15.280]  thanks for joining us on the broadcast um thank you erin that's nice to be on again it's great to
[2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:22.880]  talk to you uh it's nice to talk to you too thank you uh so give us uh your your version of events
[2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:28.560]  in terms of uh the latest with the irs coming after you uh and why you haven't paid taxes because
[2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:33.120]  i know you've been upfront about that and and what you continue to fight for and what you've
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:41.520]  always been fighting for well when my son was killed in iraq in 2004 uh i uh decided that
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:50.400]  uh my tax money has you know been part of the problem that contributed to the murder of my own son
[2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:59.360]  and so i uh decided at that point that i was going to be uh tax uh conscientious tax abjector
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:07.040]  and like you said i've been very upfront about it i've spoken about it very loudly and very clearly
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:15.600]  and my reasons um for doing so and i've been doing this now for almost eight years and last
[2:26:15.600 --> 2:26:22.800]  monday i was eating dinner at a restaurant in my town with another activist from um
[2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:31.360]  berkeley and uh this man walked in or he walked up to our table and at first i thought he was the
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:36.080]  manager because he had a tie on it because you know a lot of times people recognize me and they
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:42.160]  just want to come up and say hi and this and the guy goes hi Cindy my name is cornell and i was like
[2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:47.440]  oh hello and he said i'm from channel 10 news and i said what are you doing here in bachaville
[2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:53.280]  are you just passing through and he said no action i'm here to see you and then my mind kind of jumps
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:58.160]  like what did i do now you know i'm i'm just i'm just first of all i'm just sitting here eating
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:04.160]  dinner and secondly i've been working on my uh radio show and my book that i just published i
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:11.360]  haven't really been out uh publicly uh you know doing protests or anything lately it's been kind
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:18.080]  of a quiet year and he said that he was there to talk to me about the lawsuit filed by uh obama
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:24.960]  department of justice against me and i had no idea what he was talking about until he showed me the
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:32.400]  lawsuit and it was filed by the u.s attorney on behalf of the irs and i have had a couple meetings
[2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:39.760]  lately with the irs and i told them that i'm not cooperating with them and this lawsuit apparently
[2:27:40.320 --> 2:27:47.760]  because i still haven't been um served the paperwork it's amazing to me that channel 10 news
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:56.400]  and Sacramento got this lawsuit before i even knew about it let alone had a copy of my own and um so
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:28:04.880]  they're they're going to compel me to go into court and they're going to try to force me to provide
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:12.000]  my uh records it's amazing and uh what kind of response are you getting from the left as you
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:17.920]  continue to preach against the wars and demonstrate as obama continues these wars and many people
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:26.720]  support him in spite of that fact well it's been um you know last year maybe the year before
[2:28:27.760 --> 2:28:36.080]  we saw uh an increase of people on the so-called left uh speaking out against obama and maybe
[2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:41.520]  organizing some protests and things like that but now that it's an election year they're starting
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:51.360]  to circle the wagons again and um i've had almost 100 support about this uh with tax issue doesn't
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:58.240]  matter um you know what political identification the person is but you know there are some people
[2:28:58.240 --> 2:29:06.560]  calling me you know saying that i'm like a a tea bagger or i'm a republican because i'm refusing
[2:29:06.560 --> 2:29:14.000]  to pay my taxes i don't know republicans in general are opposed to the wars anyway so
[2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:18.720]  well we'll get more into that on the other side we've got the break coming up ahead but that's
[2:29:18.720 --> 2:29:23.200]  what i'm wondering if this has to do with the obama reelection cycle i'm sure the answer is

[2:31:44.160 --> 2:31:49.840]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good size
[2:31:49.840 --> 2:31:54.960]  meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the
[2:31:54.960 --> 2:31:59.600]  soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized world are
[2:31:59.600 --> 2:32:05.600]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies
[2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:12.000]  need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy i've then searched out the best vitamin

[2:33:15.200 --> 2:33:21.440]  now so i'm sitting in to finish off the broadcast our guest right now is cindy sheehan and i would have
[2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:28.160]  to say what she practices is civil disobedience it's an old thing basically coined by henry
[2:33:28.160 --> 2:33:34.320]  david throw who said among other things if a thousand men were not to pay their tax bills this year
[2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:39.760]  that would not be a violent and bloody measure as it would be to pay them and enable the state to
[2:33:39.760 --> 2:33:45.840]  commit violence and shed innocent blood this in fact is the definition of a peaceful revolution if any
[2:33:45.840 --> 2:33:52.320]  such is possible he also said that under a government which imprisons unjustly the true place for a just
[2:33:52.320 --> 2:33:58.560]  man is also in prison he's one of the original tax protesters and i guess it's people like cindy sheehan
[2:33:58.560 --> 2:34:06.960]  continuing in his tradition cindy uh henry david throw of course is one of my inspirations and i
[2:34:06.960 --> 2:34:12.640]  studied him when i was in college and i wish i would have paid closer attention to him back then
[2:34:12.640 --> 2:34:18.480]  and then my son might still be alive today but you know what is is and we have to go forward and
[2:34:18.480 --> 2:34:24.480]  i was just out of protest uh saturday morning early saturday morning starting well actually
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:32.160]  started friday night at five minutes to midnight they launched an icbm test missile from bandon's
[2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:39.600]  berg air force base and that cost 28 million dollars and some of us uh i think there was about
[2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:48.160]  17 of us including daniel elberg and i who uh we were you know accused of trespassing onto the base
[2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:56.320]  we wanted to stop the launch and we were met with uh you know uh what do you want to call it a squadron
[2:34:56.320 --> 2:35:08.480]  of mks who arrested us who uh treated me very uh horribly i was um you know bent over uh my back
[2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:14.320]  i was bent backwards over the front of a female mp and you know molested worse than i've ever
[2:35:14.320 --> 2:35:20.800]  been in any arrest and then we were detained in handcuffs and they ran for a couple hours afterwards
[2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:27.680]  so my hope anytime something like this happens anytime i witness the fact that you know children
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:34.720]  were killed by drone um bombs by health fire missiles in pakistan or afghanistan or anything
[2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:41.360]  like that i on my first thought i think is thank god i'm not paying for it and then i asked people
[2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:47.760]  questions about this uh if you were given a choice to drop a health fire to pay to drop a health fire
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:57.440]  missiles on you know 36 school children in northern russia stand or between going to prison which
[2:35:57.440 --> 2:36:03.440]  wants to take i would hope most people would take uh going to prison but what we do when we pay our
[2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:09.360]  taxes is we funnel it through a middleman we funnel it through the irs and most of the money
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:15.680]  uh for income taxes goes towards paying for these current wars paying for the military industrial
[2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:22.720]  complex paying debt to the banks for prior wars and debt to the banks for these wars so basically
[2:36:22.720 --> 2:36:29.760]  it's mostly going towards the military industrial complex and i for one um you know know as a tax
[2:36:29.760 --> 2:36:37.280]  resistor that eventually i could end up in prison but i would like henry davis or i'd rather be there
[2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:45.680]  than knowing that i was uh like a co-defendant with my um government in killing innocent people
[2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:50.000]  and they may bring me to court they want to bring me to court in the middle of april
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:54.880]  and i want to go to court i don't know what date april 15th is on but i want to go to court that
[2:36:54.880 --> 2:37:00.400]  day and i want to make this a movement and this is why they're coming after me erin and this is
[2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:06.400]  why they come after people with prominence because i don't think the empire thinks they can intimidate
[2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:12.080]  me anymore but what they want to do is they want to show other people what could happen to you if
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:17.680]  you decide to go the route that cindy sheen goes or that the national war tax resisting
[2:37:17.680 --> 2:37:23.600]  coordinating committee has done all the prominent people who you know are not afraid of them who are
[2:37:23.600 --> 2:37:30.480]  not afraid to um take downs like this are the ones that they go after and i could have they could
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:36.720]  have gone after me during the bush administration i feel it is very significant that um that obama's
[2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:42.240]  administration is uh persecuting me well that's the point i don't think uh there was anything good
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:47.120]  about the bush administration but i think they realized that taking you down then through your
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:52.240]  protesting the taxes uh taxes would only lend credence to your movement would only build you up
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:57.040]  at a time when that national spotlight was on you you were very iconic of the entire anti-war
[2:37:57.040 --> 2:38:02.240]  movement but all that has somehow become silent under obama you've continued to protest but so
[2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:07.280]  many others have stopped protesting against the war haven't shown up to these rallies haven't had
[2:38:07.280 --> 2:38:11.840]  their voices heard uh i mean what do you make of that it's got to be a political retribution
[2:38:11.840 --> 2:38:18.400]  as obama launches into his reelection cycle well i think um you're absolutely right i think that
[2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:24.880]  obama was you know put in place by what i call the robber class but you know the occupy movement
[2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:31.840]  calls the one percent to further the agenda of uh the one percent or the robber class and to do it
[2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:38.880]  in a way where there's very little opposition not only is there no opposition but many of these
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:45.360]  people who would have been screaming the loudest if bush or mccain had done these things are not
[2:38:45.360 --> 2:38:53.600]  not just not screaming they're supporting what he's doing so you know to me it's scandalous
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:39:00.160]  and it's pitiful and pathetic that people care more about partisan politics than they do about uh
[2:39:00.160 --> 2:39:05.600]  you know actual human beings i wrote an article not too long ago saying it would probably be better
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:13.280]  for a republican to be elected in 2012 because then at least these these progressive would care
[2:39:13.280 --> 2:39:19.920]  about innocent people again are they able to pretend to care about innocent people for political
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:24.560]  gain yeah and i want to bring up the point of michael more because he was very forward on being
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:29.840]  anti-war for years in the bush administration then obama came in we saw all the signs that he was
[2:39:29.840 --> 2:39:33.680]  going to have the same advisors that he was going to continue these wars that he was going to keep
[2:39:33.680 --> 2:39:39.360]  contractors change the names of uh what active duty troops were as he kept them in iraq and
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:44.960]  afghanistan expanding to all these other countries uh i believe it's still nine war fronts we're on
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:50.960]  and here he is today again making a splash in the news uh with his political shenanigans saying he
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:57.440]  wants to make mischief under operation hilarity and back Santorum thinking it's going to discredit
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:40:02.880]  the gop race so obama can get reelected well you don't have to agree with ron paul if you're on the
[2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:08.480]  left on economic issues or a lot of things but there's no doubting he's the only real anti-war
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:13.280]  candidate in the race and i don't understand how michael more can publicly say this and keep his
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:22.080]  supporters well because i think that it's all this paradigm you know that that these people were
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:29.200]  actually anti-bush they weren't anti-war and so of course um you know michael more has done a lot
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:38.400]  of good things and um he you know he's not the only person on in in that side of the of the fans
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:44.320]  that is doing things like this and like i said i think it's pathetic and i think it's pitiful and
[2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:51.840]  and i think it shows a lack of integrity to base their principles on a political party
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:57.520]  and you know we do on the left we have anti-war choices too and you know i think they have as
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:02.240]  much as a chance of being elected as ron paul but you know if you're if you're on the right
[2:41:02.240 --> 2:41:06.640]  and you're anti-war then you should support ron paul if you're on the left and you're anti-war you
[2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:12.400]  can support the green party or or rucky anderson of the justice party or you know who knows if
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:18.240]  some anti-war other anti-war person on the left is going to rise up but we know for a fact that
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:23.840]  somebody like you know let's talk about denis kusinich how come denis kusinich runs as an anti-war
[2:41:23.840 --> 2:41:29.760]  democrat you know for the last two times but you know he won't uh primary obama now even though
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:37.520]  like you say obama is prosecuting at least nine different um fronts of of war right now the u.s
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:44.000]  war of terror how come somebody like denis kusinich isn't standing up um and saying that you know the
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:49.520]  democrat the democratic party needs an anti-war voice yeah and his uh silence has definitely
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:53.440]  been notable i would assume there's probably been pressure behind the scenes i know he did
[2:41:53.440 --> 2:41:58.160]  speak out on the libyan front of the war and received a lot of flak from it i know from
[2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:03.200]  inside the bill de berg circle they were saying that damn kusinich is making the star force i
[2:42:03.200 --> 2:42:10.880]  interviewed him for my show cindy she has a box and he said that um it that what obama did in libya
[2:42:10.880 --> 2:42:18.080]  was an impeachable offense and i said well okay um denis if you know why aren't she's running for
[2:42:18.080 --> 2:42:23.920]  president he said well i think someone should but i'm not going to so i don't know it seems like
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:31.280]  somebody who's already run for president two times in a row and has a base could um be more of a
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:37.280]  challenger than you know somebody just coming from um nowhere to challenge obama as a democrat
[2:42:38.560 --> 2:42:42.720]  okay we've got some callers waiting even before i gave out the number but if you want to join us
[2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:50.960]  it is 1-800-259-9231 uh let's see what matthew and tennessee brings to the table are you there matthew
[2:42:51.600 --> 2:42:57.600]  i'm here this is shehan i would like you to do a small piece of investigation for me i want you
[2:42:57.600 --> 2:43:04.320]  to look at pictures of carl marx he will put his right hand in his jacket to conceal it this is a
[2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:10.480]  sign of masonic allegiance i want you to consider mrs shehan that perhaps the most effective thing
[2:43:10.480 --> 2:43:17.120]  to do is not to avoid taxes but to ask the marine corps of the united states of america to not turn
[2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:22.640]  their weapons on american citizens but rather turn their weapons on the people who give them the
[2:43:22.640 --> 2:43:31.680]  order to do so thank you very much uh send me if you want to respond to that well you know i think
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:41.600]  that um i don't like to talk about weapons being turned on anybody but i think that
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:50.080]  certainly um the military who follows orders uh even illegal and immoral orders are part of the
[2:43:50.080 --> 2:43:57.760]  problem and you know talk about obama persecuting me obama's persecuting uh bradley manning who
[2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:05.360]  uh took that serious but you know who he took that seriously that um you know soldiers are not
[2:44:05.360 --> 2:44:13.600]  required to follow uh illegal orders and look where he is you know he was in um quantico for a year
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:20.240]  and a half being tortured and now he's on trial literally for his life you know so of course i
[2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:25.280]  think that the troops that that follow these illegal immoral orders are part of the problem
[2:44:25.280 --> 2:44:31.600]  well it's uh kind of an escalation of evil as well first there's a justification that it's okay to
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:36.080]  kill civilians but it's not just in the military component we've seen our rights stripped away
[2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:41.600]  under the tsa but now everyone's re-earning the mission to somehow the homeland people are the
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:46.480]  threat and it's just scary what they're doing and they are uh talking about coming after americans
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:50.640]  are trying to convince the military people that's somehow acceptable i know a lot of them aren't
[2:44:50.640 --> 2:44:54.960]  going to go along with it i hope that proves to be the case let's see what john and north carolina
[2:44:54.960 --> 2:44:59.680]  brings to the table john are you there yeah hello cindy shean thank you very much for everything you
[2:44:59.680 --> 2:45:04.880]  do and i'm so sorry for your loss but you are a true american patriot and i'm glad that that you
[2:45:04.880 --> 2:45:10.640]  pointed out that most of the people that were backing you weren't really backing the anti-war
[2:45:10.640 --> 2:45:17.120]  effort but they were just um against bush and when i say that i thoroughly agree in the grassroots
[2:45:17.120 --> 2:45:21.760]  movements that you've made and there's a grass movement grassroots movement around right now
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:27.360]  it might help to bring out the truth about things so one of those uh affronts to freedom that happened
[2:45:27.360 --> 2:45:32.880]  recently was all the voter fraud that went in on the main gop in the caucuses and if i may
[2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:41.040]  i'd like to read a very quick um opening to this uh anyway i'll just do it the blatant voter fraud
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:46.720]  committed by the main gop in the 2012 caucus is in the front of the freedom of the american people
[2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:51.360]  their manipulation of the two were true results in disingenuous response of correcting their
[2:45:51.360 --> 2:45:57.840]  mistakes on march 10 four days after super tuesday represents obvious censorship and will not be
[2:45:57.840 --> 2:46:03.760]  tolerated therefore we are calling for a boycott of all things main unless the main gop reports
[2:46:03.760 --> 2:46:10.160]  the true and full results of the caucus before march 6 2012 this correction must be reported
[2:46:10.160 --> 2:46:14.720]  with the same fanfare and national exposure as the original fraudulent caucus results were
[2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:20.000]  presented to the nation as main businesses profit from their association with the state of main
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:25.120]  their products and services will be boycotted until this travesty of justice is rectified
[2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:29.920]  due to the time constraints the boycott will begin with the following main associated businesses
[2:46:29.920 --> 2:46:35.360]  however will not be limited to l l being incorporated poland springs water division of
[2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:41.280]  nestle waters north america mccain foods usa kinnabunt technologies americans who are against
[2:46:41.280 --> 2:46:46.320]  voter fraud and censorship could should contact these companies along with governor le page gop
[2:46:46.320 --> 2:46:51.520]  leader charlie webster main tourism bureau frank McGinty in the main chamber of commerce
[2:46:51.520 --> 2:46:57.120]  content information specifics of the fraud can be found by searching for boycott main for
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:02.720]  voter fraud and censorship on youtube that's boycott main for voter fraud and censorship
[2:47:02.720 --> 2:47:11.040]  on youtube i think we can really make a dent with this well there's been undeniable voter fraud in
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:16.400]  main as well as in nevada iowa they threw out the official results as well but it's also a
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:22.320]  delegates race uh cindy sheen isn't it time to tear down the false veil of left and right
[2:47:22.320 --> 2:47:27.760]  and really look at people who are trying to fix the system itself well you know that's one of
[2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:36.240]  the reasons that i think that um a tax remote would be uh far more effective than getting uh
[2:47:36.240 --> 2:47:42.320]  you know sucked into the cesspool of federal electoral politics because you know voter fraud
[2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:48.720]  is not the exception it's not a surprise it's the rule you know it's been happening ever since
[2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:55.760]  voting has started but now it's more sophisticated not it's not only voter fraud there's manipulation
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:48:03.040]  there's propaganda you know there's uh madison avenue selling us uh the candidate so you know
[2:48:03.040 --> 2:48:10.080]  i really think that um instead of the support candidate vote for the candidate but i think
[2:48:10.080 --> 2:48:17.440]  we should really be concentrating on um you know solutions outside of the establishment not inside
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:23.120]  of the establishment because guess what the establishment um they they own the voting
[2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:30.320]  machines they count the votes they're they're the ones that control the um you know the
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:37.280]  uh the whole process so why are we allowing ourselves to get sucked into it what we need
[2:48:37.280 --> 2:48:43.920]  to do is think of creative ways to oppose the establishment not want to be um part of the
[2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:48.320]  establishment well we can have the conversation as long as it's not about throwing out the
[2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:51.360]  constitution and bill of rights because i don't know if i'm going to agree with all of your
[2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:55.520]  solutions let's get one more call here i never said to throw out the constitution or bill of
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:49:02.560]  rights but you know what has happened is that it essentially um is meaningless to the rubber
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:11.920]  class they have already thrown those things out so um so they only apply to us then there's two
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:18.800]  systems of justice justice one for the rich and one for the poor so uh you know that the the
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:26.160]  constitution and the bill of rights has essentially been rendered meaningless by the establishment so
[2:49:26.160 --> 2:49:31.760]  we need to reclaim our rights we don't have to have our rights written on a piece of paper to
[2:49:31.760 --> 2:49:38.560]  know that we have our rights you know but but people um maybe excuse me they allow themselves
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:46.320]  to be sucked into um all this propaganda and all this establishment uh hua when you know we have
[2:49:46.320 --> 2:49:53.040]  solutions that are based right right in our own um communities well you've got a point there
[2:49:53.040 --> 2:49:57.520]  certainly our rights are god-given and uh we need some decentralized answers let's hear from

[2:54:10.320 --> 2:54:14.080]  is our guest but right now we're going to go back to linden in texas you were making a point about
[2:54:14.080 --> 2:54:21.360]  the ndaa sorry yeah the ndaa to me is really unnecessary right there it shows obama's turning
[2:54:21.360 --> 2:54:26.720]  his back on america american people should be outraged and they should get with uh all the
[2:54:26.720 --> 2:54:31.520]  people that's going against ndaa because these soldiers are dying losing their lives they didn't
[2:54:31.520 --> 2:54:37.360]  join the army say okay take all our freedoms they joined for our freedom so it's a double edged sword
[2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:42.480]  and i disagree that one guy said don't stop paying taxes send the sheen right everybody should stop
[2:54:42.480 --> 2:54:47.440]  paying taxes tell everyone in your family do not join the military until we get a legitimate
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:52.000]  government to support then you support them but if you're supporting this government you're not
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:57.200]  supporting america you're supporting an illegitimate group of people that's trying to put nuclear war
[2:54:57.200 --> 2:55:01.920]  on us right now they're hanging around our ran trying to kill us what's the sense of nuclear war
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:06.560]  and all our children gonna die you might as well be an adult and fight the system in everywhere you
[2:55:06.560 --> 2:55:11.520]  can and they beat us over the head with supporting the troops and all the ribbons but look how they
[2:55:11.520 --> 2:55:16.000]  really support the troops uh when they have mental problems or anything else or just stressed out
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:21.360]  about fighting illegal wars they come and swat team them or take their guns or or try to lock
[2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:26.960]  them up sendy she had your comments on what the caller was talking about well i agree with him
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:36.960]  about everything he just said and um chris hedges a war correspondent a journalist now
[2:55:36.960 --> 2:55:44.000]  has actually fought trying trying to file a lawsuit against barack obama and who's
[2:55:44.560 --> 2:55:52.160]  panetta leon panetta the secretary of defense about the mv a to um you know declare it illegal
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:59.040]  and unconstitutional so there are people um you know who who do have still have integrity who
[2:55:59.040 --> 2:56:06.320]  are still working against the um government no matter who's in charge it's still just amazing
[2:56:06.320 --> 2:56:11.120]  to me that people in general are not out in the streets against the india a bringing that war home
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:18.800]  to us after all these illegal wars let's hear from john in ohio we agree uh the uh this this
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:27.200]  character i think was put in uh obama obama this uh cia operative uh by the uh uh largest
[2:56:27.200 --> 2:56:31.360]  elements of the wall street in the military industrial complex yeah because they because
[2:56:31.360 --> 2:56:38.720]  they knew that uh if they had a a a an uncle tom uh president in the white house he could
[2:56:38.720 --> 2:56:45.120]  shut up the few anti-war democrats and most people are sheep if they don't have somebody
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:50.160]  who tells them it's permissible to take in a position against these wars that uh obama is
[2:56:50.160 --> 2:56:54.720]  doubling his police state measures that he's doubling as the previous college said leaders
[2:56:54.720 --> 2:57:00.320]  in the wars they become sheep and they say well who am i with my little mind my little weak mind
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:04.640]  if all of these big people and i think that people are going to have to begin to uh uh
[2:57:05.840 --> 2:57:11.200]  not to take this position that if uh we attack him the republicans will win if you attack him
[2:57:11.200 --> 2:57:16.800]  from the left for his warmongering his fascist police state his suging for wall street in the
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:22.800]  military industrial complex you automatically discredit the republicans and i think if you if
[2:57:22.800 --> 2:57:28.800]  we begin to realize that the republicans are giving him actually fake uh progressive cover
[2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:34.640]  by attacking him falsely as a social he's the exact opposite everything's done has been to uh
[2:57:34.640 --> 2:57:41.680]  enhance the power of the anti-socialist biggest monopolies bankers warmongers in the world
[2:57:41.680 --> 2:57:47.600]  in world history and and i think that the republicans are actually giving him cover and and it's a
[2:57:47.600 --> 2:57:53.600]  kind of a kabuki fake fight theater that he loves because it gives him an opportunity to get on pro
[2:57:53.600 --> 2:57:59.200]  on on television and pretend to be a populist sendy we got 30 seconds if you want to respond to
[2:57:59.200 --> 2:58:04.880]  that in closing and thank you for joining us well i agree with um everything the caller just said
[2:58:04.880 --> 2:58:11.360]  and um you know your listeners can get more information about me and my process at cindy's
