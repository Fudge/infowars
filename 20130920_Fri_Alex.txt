[00:00.000 --> 00:09.740]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.740 --> 00:11.240]  You want answers?
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.880]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.880 --> 00:17.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.080 --> 00:33.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.960 --> 00:37.480]  The House of Representatives has repealed Obamacare.
[00:37.480 --> 00:41.720]  As Congressman Walter Jones said they were scheduled to do when he joined us a couple
[00:41.720 --> 00:52.760]  days ago, and now they've done it 230 to 189 House votes to fund government, but to
[00:52.760 --> 00:55.120]  defund Obamacare.
[00:55.120 --> 01:03.000]  We're going to be breaking that down today, and we have just masses of important guests
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.720]  coming on today.
[01:04.720 --> 01:17.120]  Deborah Tavares, who is extremely well researched on the fog of magnetic frequency pollution,
[01:17.120 --> 01:20.240]  probably one of the most eloquent people out there on her website, is just full of all
[01:20.240 --> 01:22.680]  the Pentagon public documents and declassifications.
[01:22.680 --> 01:29.560]  Now, she's going to be joining us to break down some of the latest developments and how
[01:29.560 --> 01:34.080]  the system is openly admitting that they're going to use these systems to manipulate the
[01:34.080 --> 01:35.840]  human mind.
[01:35.840 --> 01:40.680]  And then Rocky Anderson, the former Salt Lake City mayor, it's now come out that the
[01:40.680 --> 01:45.640]  entire population of the city was being surveilled illegally during the Olympics.
[01:45.640 --> 01:47.320]  He's going to pop in for about 15 minutes.
[01:47.320 --> 01:55.640]  And then we've got Mike Adams in studio in the third hour to go over SSRI drugs and their
[01:55.640 --> 02:00.840]  links to mass murder in Mayhem, not even links, it's just confirmed, even members of Congress
[02:00.840 --> 02:03.280]  now, rightfully coming out.
[02:03.280 --> 02:06.160]  One Republican out of Florida and saying, we need to look at these drugs that all these
[02:06.160 --> 02:07.660]  shooters are on.
[02:07.660 --> 02:10.640]  It's basically all of them.
[02:10.640 --> 02:13.840]  The few cases where you can't find out, they just seal the medical records.
[02:13.840 --> 02:17.080]  But, well, they're under psychiatric care, but we're not going to tell you what drugs
[02:17.080 --> 02:18.080]  they were on.
[02:18.080 --> 02:19.080]  They're privacy.
[02:19.080 --> 02:20.080]  They're medical privacy.
[02:20.080 --> 02:23.840]  You don't have medical privacy after you kill a bunch of people.
[02:23.840 --> 02:27.280]  Now it needs to be public knowledge to understand what caused it.
[02:27.280 --> 02:31.440]  And we continue to see the military killing each other, committing suicide, engaging in
[02:31.440 --> 02:37.800]  massacres, and every time they are, every time they are putting them back into combat
[02:37.800 --> 02:38.800]  on psychotropics.
[02:38.800 --> 02:45.600]  Folks, if I drink too much coffee, and I'm not Mr. Tough Guy, but I'm certainly not
[02:45.600 --> 02:49.880]  a pushover, if I drink three or four cups of coffee, and then I'm out in the street
[02:49.880 --> 02:54.040]  and somebody gets in my face, I'm ready to stomp their head in.
[02:54.040 --> 02:59.520]  I can't imagine being on all these drugs they put them on, and then actually being on combat
[02:59.520 --> 03:00.520]  all the time.
[03:00.520 --> 03:07.680]  It's just, it's a wonder, it's a wonder that there isn't more people blowing gaskets.
[03:07.680 --> 03:14.360]  But sevenfold, the feds admit, the Pentagon admit, sevenfold the number of suicides now
[03:14.360 --> 03:17.720]  that they've ever had in the U.S. armed services.
[03:17.720 --> 03:24.640]  It's the pills, it's the too many tours, it's the not feeling good about the mission.
[03:24.640 --> 03:27.520]  All of that is in the equation.
[03:27.520 --> 03:34.320]  Now, obviously there's been another mass shooting and the police say gang related.
[03:34.320 --> 03:41.600]  One group playing basketball, that was either the police were saying in a gang in Chicago,
[03:41.600 --> 03:47.760]  or people thought was a gang, and folks drove by and shot them in a gun-free zone.
[03:47.760 --> 03:55.480]  Remember, there's no guns allowed there, so Chicago has now officially eclipsed New York
[03:55.480 --> 03:59.520]  as the murder capital, not just of the United States, but worldwide.
[03:59.520 --> 04:04.680]  We're on the radio there in Chicago, and most areas of Chicago, by the way, are not crime
[04:04.680 --> 04:05.680]  ridden.
[04:05.680 --> 04:12.920]  It's certain sectors where there is a gang culture that MTV and groups push.
[04:12.920 --> 04:14.400]  That's just a fact.
[04:14.400 --> 04:16.560]  Just a fact, and no one wants to say that.
[04:16.560 --> 04:22.320]  In fact, it's racist to say if you have kind of a black gangbanger culture in an area,
[04:22.320 --> 04:23.600]  and people are killing each other.
[04:23.600 --> 04:28.240]  You know, KRS-1 has been exposing it for 20 years valiantly, and we talked to him in
[04:28.240 --> 04:32.680]  the Obama deception, but other rappers and hip-hop folks, they just go ahead and just
[04:32.680 --> 04:34.720]  push the whole deal.
[04:34.720 --> 04:46.320]  That's why there's the joke out there, the comedians have put out about black bars.
[04:46.320 --> 04:50.600]  One day is opening, and next week is closing, because people are shooting each other.
[04:50.600 --> 04:54.320]  It's a real tragedy, and it didn't used to happen 30, 40 years ago.
[04:54.320 --> 05:00.640]  It is the hip-hop gangster culture.
[05:00.640 --> 05:05.880]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most
[05:05.880 --> 05:12.760]  reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens
[05:12.760 --> 05:14.320]  and parasites.
[05:14.320 --> 05:19.280]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy to use full production system for
[05:19.280 --> 05:24.320]  creating endless pure nano-silver solutions, right from the convenience and comfort of your
[05:24.320 --> 05:25.320]  home.
[05:25.320 --> 05:29.960]  Your self-produced nano-silver solutions can be applied topically to the skin.
[05:29.960 --> 05:34.440]  For many who are new to silver, that wish to try silver for the first time, we offer
[05:34.440 --> 05:40.320]  a full line of consumables and cosmetics, such as our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal sprays,
[05:40.320 --> 05:47.040]  our nano-silver soap, and our most popular product, the all-natural nano-silver gel.
[05:47.040 --> 05:53.380]  Visit www.silverlungs.com to learn more about the industry-leading technology of the Silver
[05:53.380 --> 05:54.880]  Lungs system.
[05:54.880 --> 06:00.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:03.880]  Are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been pre-selected for us?
[06:03.880 --> 06:08.000]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential
[06:08.000 --> 06:09.400]  of information.
[06:09.400 --> 06:16.320]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly, looking at how to tap into your
[06:16.320 --> 06:17.320]  psyche.
[06:17.320 --> 06:22.880]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[06:22.880 --> 06:26.480]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[06:26.480 --> 06:31.200]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying
[06:31.200 --> 06:33.200]  it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[06:33.200 --> 06:36.640]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[06:36.640 --> 06:41.560]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse
[06:41.560 --> 06:43.560]  but demand a war.
[06:43.560 --> 07:05.760]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[07:05.760 --> 07:09.560]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[07:09.560 --> 07:13.000]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.040]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[07:17.040 --> 07:23.120]  Supernatural silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[07:23.120 --> 07:27.480]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[07:27.480 --> 07:32.920]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural
[07:32.920 --> 07:39.160]  silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[07:39.160 --> 07:44.040]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[07:44.040 --> 07:48.800]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly
[07:48.800 --> 07:54.920]  pathogens, go to supernaturalsilver.com, that's supernaturalsilver.com.

[08:09.080 --> 08:12.880]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must
[08:12.880 --> 08:15.320]  mean that we're running up our debt.
[08:15.320 --> 08:20.160]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over 100 times, does not increase our
[08:20.160 --> 08:21.160]  debt.
[08:21.160 --> 08:24.320]  It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[08:24.320 --> 08:31.320]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[08:31.320 --> 08:44.000]  Yeah, folks, so run up a bunch of credit cards to the Alex Jones show.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.800]  That's right, folks.
[08:46.800 --> 08:49.680]  Run up your credit cards.
[08:49.680 --> 08:51.280]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[08:51.280 --> 08:57.080]  It is Friday, the 20th day of September, 2013.
[08:57.080 --> 09:01.960]  Run up your credit cards, just increase your debts four or five times what you can pay
[09:01.960 --> 09:06.240]  back and say, hey, my debt hasn't gone up.
[09:06.240 --> 09:13.400]  Take out 50 credit cards, max them completely out, and then get up on a podium in front
[09:13.400 --> 09:23.400]  of the entire world and say that raising the debt of the nation, the ceiling, allowing
[09:23.400 --> 09:27.000]  the debt to go above that, does not increase the debt.
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.040]  That's like saying, if I fill a glass full of water, it's not full of water.
[09:32.040 --> 09:36.200]  And if I keep pouring and it's overflowing, I go, that glass isn't overflowing.
[09:36.200 --> 09:45.980]  I mean, this is reaching biblical proportions of bull.
[09:45.980 --> 09:49.680]  And they do this on every front.
[09:49.680 --> 09:51.800]  Let me just stop right there and tell you who's coming up today.
[09:51.800 --> 09:57.520]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is going to pop in on QE Unlimited and why all these top economists
[09:57.520 --> 10:02.480]  are saying it will make the economy accelerate its collapse by the middle of next year.
[10:02.480 --> 10:03.480]  Is that accurate?
[10:03.480 --> 10:06.920]  Do you think Mark Fauber and many others are accurate?
[10:06.920 --> 10:09.120]  Ron Paul and others, are they accurate?
[10:09.120 --> 10:11.320]  Unfortunately, I think they are probably accurate.
[10:11.320 --> 10:14.280]  I'm hoping that there's some ray of sunshine.
[10:14.280 --> 10:16.520]  He's going to be joining us the bottom of the next hour.
[10:16.520 --> 10:20.840]  Former Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson is going to be joining us.
[10:20.840 --> 10:27.520]  It came out that the entire city of Salt Lake is under NSA surveillance without warrants.
[10:27.520 --> 10:28.960]  And he's been exposing it.
[10:28.960 --> 10:35.880]  So Debra Tavares is going to be coming on in the next segment to break down the government
[10:35.880 --> 10:41.400]  documents dealing with frequency pollution and the fact that they're fully aware of the
[10:41.400 --> 10:46.000]  smart meters and other systems to be used to manipulate the human mind.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.520]  This is, by the way, declassified.
[10:48.520 --> 10:52.080]  We're living in the 21st century, ladies and gentlemen, and then Mike Adams in studio
[10:52.080 --> 10:57.640]  to cover a host of breaking health issues, the SSRIs, what's happening and more.
[10:57.640 --> 10:58.640]  Here's the deal.
[10:58.640 --> 11:05.600]  I will not go to a biker bar, not a big bar person anyways, but here in Austin, every
[11:05.600 --> 11:10.360]  restaurant you can think of is pretty, most of them are bars as well, and I like to hear
[11:10.360 --> 11:11.360]  live music.
[11:11.360 --> 11:16.480]  I like old fashioned rock and roll, I like country music, classical country music, I
[11:16.480 --> 11:20.640]  like blues, I like basically anything good.
[11:20.640 --> 11:24.440]  I like country and I like western, like they say in the Blues Brothers, what type of music
[11:24.440 --> 11:25.440]  do you have?
[11:25.440 --> 11:27.640]  We have all kinds, country and western.
[11:27.640 --> 11:34.360]  But I will go out maybe once a month when I have time and listen to music.
[11:34.360 --> 11:38.800]  The problem is, where you can really go hear good old fashioned rockabilly, rock and roll
[11:38.800 --> 11:43.800]  and blues and things like that, is you will have bikers in there, and I don't mean your
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.560]  Sunday bikers that just like to wear leather jackets and ride cool motorcycles.
[11:47.560 --> 11:56.640]  I mean real organized crime bikers, you know, Hell's Angel type bikers, and I don't like
[11:56.640 --> 12:02.040]  going places where guys shove you up against the bar and are looking for a fight, looking
[12:02.040 --> 12:03.120]  to die.
[12:03.120 --> 12:08.480]  I'm not looking to die, and I'm not looking for trouble either, and it's the exact same
[12:08.480 --> 12:09.480]  thing.
[12:09.480 --> 12:16.360]  Now, so many bars become unpopular when groups like the Banditos, basically the Hell's Angels
[12:16.360 --> 12:22.240]  of this area of the country, both they're worldwide, come into the facility.
[12:22.240 --> 12:23.240]  And they're serious.
[12:23.240 --> 12:27.000]  People try to set up Hell's Angels groups, you know, they get whacked.
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.760]  The fact is you're there trying to hear music, not with some guy's trip that he's a tough
[12:30.760 --> 12:33.640]  guy, okay?
[12:33.640 --> 12:38.080]  I say that because it's a thug culture and I think it's disgusting.
[12:38.080 --> 12:43.920]  And whereas the Banditos or groups like that were set up by, you know, former U.S. military
[12:43.920 --> 12:51.000]  people, and it accepts all groups, you've got then other racial gangs like the Crips
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.840]  and the Bloods, and that's about 95% they estimate, and I've got the news articles out
[12:56.840 --> 13:01.000]  of the Chicago Tribune on this and the Chicago Sun-Times and others, and the police have
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.800]  said this, over 90% of the crime is gang related and it's black on black.
[13:07.800 --> 13:12.200]  In Chicago, it's in the black areas of town, the poor black areas of town, they're just
[13:12.200 --> 13:15.760]  killing each other, and the police have been telling the truth about it, but the media
[13:15.760 --> 13:20.040]  does not want to touch it, and they say, oh, it's racist if you point out that it's this
[13:20.040 --> 13:21.760]  whole gangbanger culture.
[13:21.760 --> 13:26.800]  Same deal, I don't want to go to some gangbanger bar where people are probably going to shoot
[13:26.800 --> 13:27.800]  each other.
[13:27.800 --> 13:33.200]  In fact, I mean, Chris Rock's a funny guy, he says stuff like Obama's our God, and we've
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.600]  got to, you know, follow him like he's our father, and no, excuse me, Jamie Fox says
[13:37.600 --> 13:40.640]  he's our Lord and Savior Barack Obama.
[13:40.640 --> 13:45.280]  Chris Rock says he's our father, and Michelle's our mother, and we've got to do what they
[13:45.280 --> 13:46.280]  say.
[13:46.280 --> 13:51.880]  But the reason I raise that is, it's not racist to say I don't want to go be around, they've
[13:51.880 --> 13:57.520]  got white supremacist bikers that are also very horrible, and it's a thug culture.
[13:57.520 --> 14:00.960]  You've got other groups, like I mentioned the Banditos, don't want to be around it.
[14:00.960 --> 14:04.760]  I just want to go here and music and hang out and laugh and joke with my friends and
[14:04.760 --> 14:05.760]  play pool.
[14:05.760 --> 14:08.920]  I don't have anything to prove is my point.
[14:08.920 --> 14:13.240]  And then it's the same thing for these urban areas, but in Chicago, it's black on black,
[14:13.240 --> 14:17.320]  and it's a scourge, and Jesse Jackson won't talk about it, Al Sharpton won't talk about
[14:17.320 --> 14:18.320]  it.
[14:18.320 --> 14:22.520]  Instead, they get up and say, the NRA, you can pull up articles where they say this
[14:22.520 --> 14:29.960]  at nauseam, the NRA is responsible because there's guns in America, and that's why black
[14:29.960 --> 14:31.520]  people are killing each other.
[14:31.520 --> 14:36.960]  No, they're killing each other because sometime in the last 30 years, it became cool to be
[14:36.960 --> 14:40.280]  a gangsta.
[14:40.280 --> 14:44.480]  Who sings that song, damn, it feels good to be a gangsta.
[14:44.480 --> 14:45.480]  That's the ghetto boys.
[14:45.480 --> 14:52.200]  I actually ran into him, Bushwack Bill, at one of the bars, had the Banditos at it.
[14:52.200 --> 14:58.680]  We're walking in there and Mike Judge goes, oh no, Banditos, let's go to another bar.
[14:58.680 --> 15:02.360]  Yeah, the one percenters.
[15:02.360 --> 15:06.320]  Anyways, ladies and gentlemen, see now I'm getting into this is what we're talking about
[15:06.320 --> 15:07.320]  here.
[15:07.320 --> 15:15.120]  By the way, he got thrown out of the bar that night, Bushwack Bill or whatever his name
[15:15.120 --> 15:16.120]  is.
[15:16.120 --> 15:18.200]  We're running into that guy, small world.
[15:18.200 --> 15:27.480]  The point is, it's really a bummer that wherever you want to go to hear good music, this type
[15:27.480 --> 15:28.480]  of stuff is going on.
[15:28.480 --> 15:33.560]  So anyways, you got folks out there who they thought were a rival gang, and very sad, out
[15:33.560 --> 15:37.400]  there at the basketball court, and this is where it's always happening at basketball
[15:37.400 --> 15:41.320]  courts because gangs will say, this basketball court belongs to us.
[15:41.320 --> 15:45.680]  When I was a kid growing up in Dallas, I had friends, you know, I was on the football team
[15:45.680 --> 15:46.680]  with her.
[15:46.680 --> 15:50.680]  I knew who got shot because they wanted to go to the basketball court in the neighborhood
[15:50.680 --> 15:54.560]  even in nicer areas because a group said, no, that's our court.
[15:54.560 --> 15:59.600]  We're going to deal drugs there and you don't come out there or somebody gets beat at basketball
[15:59.600 --> 16:02.080]  and so somebody goes and gets their gun and shoots people.
[16:02.080 --> 16:05.520]  This culture needs to be decried, okay?
[16:05.520 --> 16:12.480]  The gangster thug culture is an absolute joke and the police get to where they're afraid
[16:12.480 --> 16:15.520]  of the gang culture because they're basically in their own gang in many respects, especially
[16:15.520 --> 16:16.600]  in big cities.
[16:16.600 --> 16:21.640]  And so I get back to gang culture, government gangs, corporate gangs, everything forms into
[16:21.640 --> 16:22.640]  gangs.
[16:22.640 --> 16:29.280]  How about we form into a constitutional republic where the family, the Bill of Rights do process
[16:29.280 --> 16:34.240]  being honorable, that's our colors.
[16:34.240 --> 16:40.320]  Respecting human dignity, respecting the right of self-defense, respecting women.
[16:40.320 --> 16:41.720]  That's what builds civilizations.
[16:41.720 --> 16:42.880]  That's what's honorable.
[16:42.880 --> 16:47.560]  Not acting like thugs who are more than happy to go to prison and who think it's really
[16:47.560 --> 16:52.200]  cool that they're low down and, you know, really tough.
[16:52.200 --> 16:58.600]  I mean, I got up with that when I was about 16, but a lot of people never get over that
[16:58.600 --> 17:03.680]  and that's the type of people that end up running our society that are in government.
[17:03.680 --> 17:04.760]  And that's the problem.
[17:04.760 --> 17:07.040]  And that's why Fox News is reporting.
[17:07.040 --> 17:13.480]  Remember three weeks ago, we published a report from Judicial Watch that the army said that
[17:13.480 --> 17:17.800]  George Washington would not be welcome, this is a quote, and the founding fathers would
[17:17.800 --> 17:19.880]  not be welcome in today's army.
[17:19.880 --> 17:23.560]  You swear an oath to that Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the greatest document in
[17:23.560 --> 17:24.760]  government ever.
[17:24.760 --> 17:25.760]  Believe me, it's amazing.
[17:25.760 --> 17:26.760]  I've read it.
[17:26.760 --> 17:27.760]  I studied it.
[17:27.760 --> 17:28.760]  Please.
[17:28.760 --> 17:29.760]  There it is.
[17:29.760 --> 17:32.760]  DoD, training manual, extremist founding fathers would not be welcome in today's military.
[17:32.760 --> 17:38.240]  So in California, and I want to get these folks on from the newscast I saw, it looks
[17:38.240 --> 17:40.200]  like it's the pocket constitutions we put out.
[17:40.200 --> 17:43.960]  In fact, I bet when we get these guys on, and we have some of the footage we can roll
[17:43.960 --> 17:49.720]  in the background for TV viewers, when we get these folks on, I bet they're listeners.
[17:49.720 --> 17:52.200]  I mean, this happens all the time with activists.
[17:52.200 --> 17:56.320]  We have great salt of the earth activists, and they told them you were not to hand out
[17:56.320 --> 18:02.200]  that document on the school campus.
[18:02.200 --> 18:03.200]  Imagine this.
[18:03.200 --> 18:04.880]  You don't hand anything out, slaves.
[18:04.880 --> 18:11.120]  You're not allowed in the commons area to communicate, because we're calling that solicitation.
[18:11.120 --> 18:12.120]  It's not solicitation.
[18:12.120 --> 18:14.280]  You're giving them something about freedom.
[18:14.280 --> 18:17.880]  You're not there trying to tell them to come to your hamburger stand.
[18:17.880 --> 18:22.080]  But it's always selectively enforced, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:22.080 --> 18:25.480]  And so the Constitution guarantees the right of free speech, but don't try to pass out
[18:25.480 --> 18:30.920]  copies in Modesto Junior College in California, a student of the school who tried to pass
[18:30.920 --> 18:36.280]  out pocket-sized pamphlets, the very document that memorializes our rights, got shut down
[18:36.280 --> 18:40.800]  on September 17th, a date also known as Constitution Day.
[18:40.800 --> 18:43.200]  And the whole thing was caught on videotape.
[18:43.200 --> 18:47.200]  Meanwhile, somebody took a photo of Hillary Clinton, and she didn't like it.
[18:47.200 --> 18:51.760]  So she had her security guards, this is in the Miami Herald, grab the person and delete
[18:51.760 --> 18:53.360]  their photos.
[18:53.360 --> 18:54.360]  So there you go.
[18:54.360 --> 19:00.160]  That's Hillary Clinton's image control, security swipes, man's phone, a racist picker of speech.
[19:00.160 --> 19:03.680]  And you can't wear a Duck Dynasty shirt and go to school or you get kicked out.
[19:03.680 --> 19:05.320]  That's CBS News.
[19:05.320 --> 19:06.320]  So there you go.
[19:06.320 --> 19:07.960]  Man, that's really a free country.
[19:07.960 --> 19:11.880]  And by the way, in Seattle, don't use the word brown bag or you can get fired.
[19:11.880 --> 19:14.320]  That's racist, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:14.320 --> 19:24.040]  That is absolutely, totally evil and racist, my friends, to in this country, say the word
[19:24.040 --> 19:25.040]  brown bag.
[19:25.040 --> 19:26.040]  Of course, I looked it up.
[19:26.040 --> 19:27.040]  Brown bag never had any connotation.
[19:27.040 --> 19:34.880]  It just means, you know, the cheap and expensive paper that we all use for 150 years.
[19:34.880 --> 19:38.200]  But this is how they program everybody, because see, they know you're not really racist.
[19:38.200 --> 19:41.640]  So they've got a program where you feel bad and you're just watching yourself for a minute.
[19:41.640 --> 19:43.480]  I better not.
[19:43.480 --> 19:46.000]  People think you've been saying, let's go eat Mexican food is racist.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.840]  I mean, it's just everything's racist, but putting cancer viruses and vaccines and injecting
[19:50.840 --> 19:56.160]  everyone and having smart meters blasting you with ELF radiation in your house, that's
[19:56.160 --> 19:57.560]  all okay.
[19:57.560 --> 20:00.400]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.

[21:00.120 --> 21:04.320]  I'm sick of how the big drug companies are keeping men from fixing their ED without
[21:04.320 --> 21:05.320]  pills.
[21:05.320 --> 21:09.600]  Matt Cook here from getedsolutions.com and I've helped thousands of men fully recover
[21:09.600 --> 21:11.800]  from ED without pills, pumps or supplements.
[21:11.800 --> 21:16.080]  But the big drug companies collect $5 billion in revenue from sales of ED medications.
[21:16.080 --> 21:17.560]  They don't want my message to get out.
[21:17.560 --> 21:19.400]  Thanks for so much better now.
[21:19.400 --> 21:21.440]  Everything kind of came back overnight.

[21:59.840 --> 22:04.600]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[22:04.600 --> 22:07.640]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[22:07.640 --> 22:13.200]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism and every other major disease.
[22:13.200 --> 22:15.160]  It all comes down to one thing.
[22:15.160 --> 22:16.800]  We are what we eat.
[22:16.800 --> 22:21.440]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[22:21.440 --> 22:25.680]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[22:25.680 --> 22:28.240]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[22:28.240 --> 22:33.160]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[22:33.160 --> 22:34.480]  desperately needs.

[23:05.400 --> 23:06.800]  What are bitcoins?
[23:06.800 --> 23:11.480]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person
[23:11.480 --> 23:13.400]  to person over the internet.
[23:13.400 --> 23:15.280]  No bank needed.

[24:08.080 --> 24:10.200]  We are on the march.
[24:10.200 --> 24:14.040]  The empire is on the run.
[24:14.040 --> 24:15.280]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[24:15.280 --> 24:16.280]  Thank you for joining us.
[24:16.280 --> 24:25.200]  So again, 13 shot including a three-year-old boy playing basketball at a public park in
[24:25.200 --> 24:29.920]  Chicago and I thought that the city has a gun band that would keep us all safe.
[24:29.920 --> 24:36.320]  Well, the Reverend Jackson and everybody else says that if we all lost our guns, but they're
[24:36.320 --> 24:40.760]  still going to have armed bodyguards, they're going to have guns, Dian Feinstein's going
[24:40.760 --> 24:44.960]  to have guns, Chuck E. Schumer's going to have guns, Michael Moore's going to have guns,
[24:44.960 --> 24:52.120]  Michael Moore has up to six bodyguards at any one time who carry guns on record, but
[24:52.120 --> 24:53.560]  you're not going to have them.
[24:53.560 --> 24:55.960]  Do you understand?
[24:55.960 --> 25:04.520]  This is all about elitism and they know it's all about elitism and so instead of people
[25:04.520 --> 25:11.000]  coming together and saying we're not going to have this thug culture, wherever you find
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.760]  it, instead of that happening, it is being promoted as the coolest thing.
[25:16.760 --> 25:21.280]  In fact, it's been over 20 years, there's nothing cooler than thug life.
[25:21.280 --> 25:27.040]  I mean, you're out in Hollywood and all these Hollywood stars have got gangster tattoos
[25:27.040 --> 25:29.320]  and try to act like thugs.
[25:29.320 --> 25:36.480]  It is simply amazing and simply ridiculous and it's all about arrested development and
[25:36.480 --> 25:43.080]  it's all about the self and all about just mindless idiocy and all about cheating and
[25:43.080 --> 25:49.560]  being cheated and it's truly disgusting to see this type of thing happening.
[25:49.560 --> 25:56.920]  Now, shifting gears into the really serious news, speaking of thug life, Senator Lindsey
[25:56.920 --> 26:04.280]  Graham to seek authorization for US attack on Iran and I saw him say this on Huckabee
[26:04.280 --> 26:05.280]  last weekend.
[26:05.280 --> 26:09.640]  I was watching clips of it again yesterday as he laughed talking about attacking Iran.
[26:09.640 --> 26:13.400]  It's watching Lindsey Graham with a sound off too is really creepy when we're grabbing
[26:13.400 --> 26:19.240]  the video and he has now come out and said the president doesn't need authorization
[26:19.240 --> 26:23.080]  to hit Iran, but he wants to just give it to him anyways and put it on the table and
[26:23.080 --> 26:27.640]  he's coming up with a resolution to attack Iran.
[26:27.640 --> 26:30.160]  This is when Iran comes out and says we want to meet with Obama.
[26:30.160 --> 26:31.760]  We never want nuclear weapons.
[26:31.760 --> 26:39.240]  They have elected, set a hard line, people like Ahmadinejid, a lot softer folks.
[26:39.240 --> 26:44.280]  When they say they want to eradicate Israel, the actual quote is eradicate the Zionist
[26:44.280 --> 26:49.920]  regime and have everybody live in peace in Jerusalem, Jewish, Muslim and other.
[26:49.920 --> 26:52.360]  I'm sorry, that's just the full quotes.
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.880]  And again, folks, I've never been to Iran, don't have a dog in the fight here, but our
[26:56.880 --> 27:00.400]  government overthrew their country in 53.
[27:00.400 --> 27:05.920]  In 1988, they launched Operation Prank Manus blowing up all their ships for no reason.
[27:05.920 --> 27:11.720]  They funded the Iraqis for seven years, killing over a million of them and our government
[27:11.720 --> 27:12.720]  gave them nerve gas.
[27:12.720 --> 27:19.360]  I mean, our government has been attacking Iran over and over because our government
[27:19.360 --> 27:23.920]  in 1979, this has been declassified, that's why they had Iran contra a few years later
[27:23.920 --> 27:26.880]  continued, but it started with Jimmy Carter.
[27:26.880 --> 27:32.360]  Our government helped put the Ayatollahs in power.
[27:32.360 --> 27:36.920]  Oh, you didn't, you didn't know that.
[27:36.920 --> 27:38.920]  You didn't know that.
[27:38.920 --> 27:43.680]  Oh yeah, and then they, then they double crossed and grabbed the hostages, but it turned out
[27:43.680 --> 27:48.200]  that was a deal with the CIA to then discredit another faction, just like we're seeing with
[27:48.200 --> 27:50.200]  Benghazi.
[27:50.200 --> 27:56.240]  So that they could then blame the hostage situation on Jimmy Carter.
[27:56.240 --> 28:01.600]  And then the day Reagan gets elected, boom, they release everybody went, wow, Reagan's
[28:01.600 --> 28:02.600]  really tough.
[28:02.600 --> 28:03.600]  They're scared of Reagan.
[28:03.600 --> 28:07.840]  And again, I'm no fan of Jimmy Carter either or as big and Brzezinski, it's just different
[28:07.840 --> 28:11.560]  power arms fighting with each other within the system.
[28:11.560 --> 28:15.200]  Imagine what the Iranian people who, by the way, on average are very pro America.
[28:15.200 --> 28:16.200]  They don't like the mulus.
[28:16.200 --> 28:25.200]  Most of the polls you see are upwards of 75 to 80% of the people under 30 are anti government.
[28:25.200 --> 28:31.120]  But the West is trying to overthrow it again, just to put something else in over there.
[28:31.120 --> 28:35.360]  And was teamed up with an even more hardline group a few years ago, what four years ago
[28:35.360 --> 28:40.120]  with the green revolution, as they called it, to put something in even nastier.
[28:40.120 --> 28:41.120]  Because here's the bottom line.
[28:41.120 --> 28:45.960]  Just like Israel was public on Monday, Benjamin yet in Yahoo, they said, yes, we don't like
[28:45.960 --> 28:53.280]  Al-Qaeda or Assad, but we think Al-Qaeda and the rebels are better for us than Assad because
[28:53.280 --> 28:56.280]  of his relationship with Iran.
[28:56.280 --> 29:00.160]  That was in Reuters, okay?
[29:00.160 --> 29:04.800]  The LeCoudnics that run Israel came out and said, we want to topple Assad.
[29:04.800 --> 29:08.400]  We tried to stay off in the sideline publicly.
[29:08.400 --> 29:11.760]  They were on the sideline, but in reality, they were funding it, just like all the other
[29:11.760 --> 29:13.760]  people in the region, ganging up.
[29:13.760 --> 29:18.800]  That's a bunch of gangs, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, NATO, they're all in there.
[29:18.800 --> 29:25.640]  They're all in there wanting to carve up Syria and it's totally immoral.
[29:25.640 --> 29:30.400]  And now Iran is like, hey, let's make friends, okay?
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.320]  And they're like, nope, there it is, White House Obama willing to meet with Iran's leader
[29:35.320 --> 29:36.760]  at the UN.
[29:36.760 --> 29:45.600]  But Reuters, Israel calls Iranian President's nuclear comments deceptive and Israel continues
[29:45.600 --> 29:49.720]  to basically push for a strike.
[29:49.720 --> 29:53.440]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:53.440 --> 30:00.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[32:56.880 --> 33:24.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:24.880 --> 33:35.160]  Well, the House has voted 230 to 189 to fund the government, but to defund Obamacare.
[33:35.160 --> 33:41.200]  And good job to House Republicans, because as bad as they are, they are angels compared
[33:41.200 --> 33:42.560]  to Obama.
[33:42.560 --> 33:47.200]  And I always am the person who coined the term left-right paradigm, they try to keep
[33:47.200 --> 33:51.640]  you in a left-right paradigm to make us fight with each other when it's we the people against
[33:51.640 --> 33:55.120]  the globalist, we the people who are under attack.
[33:55.120 --> 34:00.080]  But there is reality within the left and right at the grassroots.
[34:00.080 --> 34:05.280]  There are different policies, different groups, different lobbying arms within that controlled
[34:05.280 --> 34:06.280]  paradigm.
[34:06.280 --> 34:12.280]  And I would like to see more people like Rand Paul, who's pro-gun, pro-national sovereignty,
[34:12.280 --> 34:14.920]  low taxes, the things that made this country great.
[34:14.920 --> 34:17.040]  I would like to see him president.
[34:17.040 --> 34:20.360]  I would like to see Democrats and Republicans.
[34:20.360 --> 34:25.520]  I would vote for Democrats right now if they acted anything like Ron Paul or Rand Paul.
[34:25.520 --> 34:29.520]  I don't care what they were called.
[34:29.520 --> 34:34.000]  As long as they promote the basic context of freedom.
[34:34.000 --> 34:35.240]  And that's what it comes down to.
[34:35.240 --> 34:39.800]  So when I say left-right paradigm, we need to get outside just my party right or wrong
[34:39.800 --> 34:42.080]  or I'm a Republican or I'm a Democrat.
[34:42.080 --> 34:47.000]  Well, I'm a Democrat, so I'm going to back Obama striking Syria out of loyalty.
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.000]  You're supposed to be loyal to common sense, loyal to what's right, plus life's so much
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.760]  easier if you just do what's right.
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.920]  Sometimes in business or life, I want to do something that seems like it's wrong because
[35:02.920 --> 35:07.720]  it would help me get things done and I always just do the right thing and it always turns
[35:07.720 --> 35:10.640]  out better.
[35:10.640 --> 35:15.280]  But people think cheating and stealing or cutting corners or lying is the way to get
[35:15.280 --> 35:16.280]  ahead.
[35:16.280 --> 35:18.840]  Long term, it's not.
[35:18.840 --> 35:23.840]  Even for the elite themselves that have gotten into full control through fraud, long term,
[35:23.840 --> 35:29.760]  we're now here, long term, 100 years of the fellow deserve this year, it will be 100 years
[35:29.760 --> 35:34.840]  starting next year, December 23rd, 1913.
[35:34.840 --> 35:41.520]  So December 23rd, we're going to be live on air for 100 years of the bankers in control
[35:41.520 --> 35:42.520]  of America.
[35:42.520 --> 35:48.160]  We got a beachhead in 1913, but since then they have pretty much taken everything over
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.240]  except for a little bit of state's rights and individuals waking up.
[35:52.240 --> 35:57.120]  And the minute we realize their takeover is fraudulent, the minute we realize that they
[35:57.120 --> 36:04.000]  took over by fraud, it's all null and void, ladies and gentlemen, and we can begin to
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  turn the tide and we are on the verge of turning the tide right now.
[36:09.000 --> 36:16.200]  So we're going to open the phones up for callers who want to call in on any subject as long
[36:16.200 --> 36:21.880]  as you're a first time caller, the situation in Syria, the Republican leadership, again,
[36:21.880 --> 36:28.160]  the Republican leadership in the House has been to a great extent anti-war except for
[36:28.160 --> 36:30.880]  Boehner, the speaker.
[36:30.880 --> 36:36.760]  The Republican leadership in the Senate has been diabolically warmongering, but you've
[36:36.760 --> 36:42.240]  got the Republican leadership in the House not letting them pass gun bans, not letting
[36:42.240 --> 36:47.600]  them pass restrictions on free speech, trying to repeal Obamacare and so many other things.
[36:47.600 --> 36:55.960]  There is a core of good people in there, and it is so important to get libertarian constitutionalist
[36:55.960 --> 37:01.800]  types elected coming up, and I know there's election fraud as well, but when there's overwhelming
[37:01.800 --> 37:06.800]  landslides according to all the election fraud experts that we've interviewed, when there's
[37:06.800 --> 37:12.040]  a landslide it's very hard for them to spin that because they know how obvious it is,
[37:12.040 --> 37:15.200]  and they tend to back off when it's a landslide.
[37:15.200 --> 37:21.880]  So we need to absolutely push now America is waking up to tyranny, they have heard the
[37:21.880 --> 37:29.240]  lies of socialism, they believed in them, it didn't deliver, now they are turning towards
[37:29.240 --> 37:31.560]  the Constitution again.
[37:31.560 --> 37:37.400]  And we have to explain to people that the globalists are in control, and it's not capitalism
[37:37.400 --> 37:43.160]  that didn't deliver, it was allowing combines, monopoly men, to get control of the system
[37:43.160 --> 37:49.720]  that brought us to this point, and it's so essential during this time of great change
[37:49.720 --> 37:55.800]  that we explain it's the globalists that engineered the current civilization we're
[37:55.800 --> 38:06.560]  in that's so predatory, and that it's now time for all of us to get the word out about
[38:06.560 --> 38:12.520]  what made this country great versus what the establishment is trying to push more tyranny,
[38:12.520 --> 38:15.720]  more centralization that got us into this position.
[38:15.720 --> 38:23.920]  But going back to the Iran situation, here's the toll free number, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231
[38:23.920 --> 38:26.200]  on this Friday edition.
[38:26.200 --> 38:31.960]  Senator Lindsey Graham to seek authorization for U.S. attack on Iran, he's one of the strongest
[38:31.960 --> 38:36.440]  advocates of an American military strike, you mean a globalist military strike, against
[38:36.440 --> 38:38.360]  the Assad regime in Syria.
[38:38.360 --> 38:42.960]  He was unhappy when President Obama decided to seek congressional authorization for an
[38:42.960 --> 38:46.880]  attack, because that's constitutional and that's anathema to him.
[38:46.880 --> 38:51.280]  And then unhappy when his fellow lawmakers voiced his approval of the president's plan.
[38:51.280 --> 38:57.040]  Graham believes the diplomatic path chosen by the administration will lead to a debacle.
[38:57.040 --> 39:03.160]  Now the debacle is that you guys tried to push a totally illegal war, and our own joint
[39:03.160 --> 39:10.480]  chiefs of staff and the chairman and the military in one voice said, we're not war criminals.
[39:10.480 --> 39:15.880]  Enough of this fraud, we're not buying the Cyop, the Russians have put 11 ships there,
[39:15.880 --> 39:20.240]  they say they're going to defend, this could lead to World War III, we don't like siding
[39:20.240 --> 39:25.680]  with al-Qaeda, we're sick of your lies, we know you stood down in Benghazi.
[39:25.680 --> 39:30.920]  By the way, there's a video on our YouTube channel that is my rant yesterday, and the
[39:30.920 --> 39:34.960]  headline is, was the SWAT team ordered to stand down?
[39:34.960 --> 39:40.000]  And this is an example of my whole crew, you guys called David, haven't changed that, thanks,
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.520]  I forgot to do that this morning.
[39:43.520 --> 39:47.680]  It's admitted the SWAT team was ordered to stand down, they've gone public, it's in
[39:47.680 --> 39:52.920]  the BBC at the Navy Yard, they got there five minutes after, turned out one team was at
[39:52.920 --> 39:59.080]  the Capitol, the other team was in armored trucks coming from a training ground, fully
[39:59.080 --> 40:02.600]  suited and loaded back to barracks.
[40:02.600 --> 40:06.320]  That's how they were there five minutes before, because I have inside contacts, not just what's
[40:06.320 --> 40:12.840]  in BBC, I have inside contacts, and I'm just going to leave it at that, and we know exactly,
[40:12.840 --> 40:18.760]  they were there five minutes at the gate, and then they were, because the police were
[40:18.760 --> 40:23.840]  calling them there, and then they were told, oh sorry, order from the Justice Department,
[40:23.840 --> 40:31.520]  stand down for 45 more minutes, unbelievable, very suspicious folks, but shifting gears.
[40:31.520 --> 40:41.360]  Senator Lindsey Graham to seek authorization for US attack on Iran, White House Obama willing
[40:41.360 --> 40:49.000]  to meet with Iran's new leader, Rohani, who has not seen his hard line compared to Ahmed
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.160]  Energy, well isn't that just terrible, that the Iranians want peace, well that's just
[40:55.160 --> 41:00.800]  evil, and Obama's being forced to act like he's being diplomatic is a little embarrassing,
[41:00.800 --> 41:05.800]  but guaranteed their plan is to attack, because the planets are aligned politically, they
[41:05.800 --> 41:11.760]  want to divert away from all the scandals that Obama has, Saudi Arabia is a big player,
[41:11.760 --> 41:18.880]  they want to go after their Shiite enemy, Turkey wants to grab part of the area and
[41:18.880 --> 41:24.920]  go after their Shiite enemy, Israel wants to do it and go after an old enemy, breaking
[41:24.920 --> 41:28.360]  the country up and turning it over to al-Qaeda, yeah who cares about all those Christians
[41:28.360 --> 41:34.720]  Israel, that have already 2 million have fled, I mean listen, I want the Christian churches
[41:34.720 --> 41:41.760]  in this country, who send so much money to Israel and are so supportive of Israel, it's
[41:41.760 --> 41:46.600]  really time for you to ask yourselves, you know, if you're going to spend the time looking
[41:46.600 --> 41:50.360]  at what's being done to the Christians of Syria, we've seen hardly anything out of the
[41:50.360 --> 41:57.160]  pope, if you're Catholic, about the Christians being slaughtered there, he said a war attacking
[41:57.160 --> 42:01.840]  them is not good, that's a good thing, but I mean where's the pope, I mean the pope came
[42:01.840 --> 42:06.320]  out and said this is wrong and you shouldn't kill Catholics especially, but because they're
[42:06.320 --> 42:10.360]  Catholic but Orthodox are being killed as well, you would think you'd hear that, but
[42:10.360 --> 42:15.520]  instead the pope is saying hey, what worrying about abortion so much, you know, reach out
[42:15.520 --> 42:20.320]  to people on other things, that's what will make us more popular, that's what goes on
[42:20.320 --> 42:23.680]  at the Protestant churches now, it's like oh, we don't want to talk about issues that
[42:23.680 --> 42:27.400]  are serious, we just want to be like a country club or something and then that will make
[42:27.400 --> 42:31.760]  us all popular, well I mean I can go to the country club if I want to and nobody's me talking
[42:31.760 --> 42:36.840]  about abortion there, they'll be talking about their golf score, their racquetball score,
[42:36.840 --> 42:44.920]  their squash score, you know, what their mistresses up to, I mean you know, it's unbelievable
[42:44.920 --> 42:51.280]  folks how the whole world is getting behind this globalist agenda and everybody knows
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.080]  I've been widely criticized for not getting into the Palestinian-Israeli thing, it's
[42:55.080 --> 42:59.680]  a tar ball that's never going to get fixed, tribal warfare, thousands of years since
[42:59.680 --> 43:05.000]  David was fighting Goliath, it just never ends and they want you to be on either side,
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.840]  instead I'm pointing out the globalist are manipulating both sides against the middle,
[43:08.840 --> 43:15.600]  but this is immoral, any way you slice it, for Israel to say oh, we want to destabilize
[43:15.600 --> 43:22.320]  Syria and so we want al-Qaeda to have half the country, I mean that was in Reuters Monday
[43:22.320 --> 43:26.000]  and then the great part is I get to lose my liberty because of the al-Qaeda threat that
[43:26.000 --> 43:32.360]  the West, NATO, the French, disgusting French socialist leader needs diversions as well
[43:32.360 --> 43:37.840]  from all his scandals, so he's all pushing it, and then Lindsey Graham up there acting
[43:37.840 --> 43:42.480]  like a tough guy on Fox News saying, listen the president doesn't need to come to us,
[43:42.480 --> 43:48.000]  I want him to strike right now, but we're going to put her on the table just so you
[43:48.000 --> 43:54.480]  know you can, what a disgusting thing and then here it is, here it is, no time left
[43:54.480 --> 44:02.720]  for negotiations with Iran, Israeli minister says no time left, it's time to attack them,
[44:02.720 --> 44:07.840]  Israel reportedly has between 400 and 800 weapons, there's different numbers, nuclear
[44:07.840 --> 44:16.720]  weapons, dolphin submarines, long range missiles, medium range cruise missiles, I mean you know,
[44:16.720 --> 44:23.960]  it's incredible and let me tell you as all nuclear technicians, soldiers will tell you
[44:23.960 --> 44:29.960]  we've heard them on the show, we've had guests, if one nuke ever goes off in a combat zone,
[44:29.960 --> 44:35.560]  nuclear war is about a 90% chance, in fact what I've been told is it's going to happen,
[44:35.560 --> 44:39.880]  everybody's going to release and then that's it, it's all over, so Lindsey Graham's can
[44:39.880 --> 44:45.880]  go to sidearm right outside DC and it's got enough food and water for a decade under there
[44:45.880 --> 44:50.840]  and they reportedly got swimming pools and jacuzzi's in there and just like Dr. Strangelub
[44:50.840 --> 44:56.120]  they're planning on bringing you know large contingents of whatever the senators are into
[44:56.120 --> 45:00.400]  down in there, so they'll you know they'll take a bunch of your young pages in there
[45:00.400 --> 45:06.360]  with them, male pages or whatever and female pages and it'll be a big party down there
[45:06.360 --> 45:11.320]  while we all dive radiation poisoning and you know I don't think that's a very good
[45:11.320 --> 45:16.360]  idea and I don't want to be part of that okay, because I don't have a bunker, I don't even
[45:16.360 --> 45:19.560]  have the time, the money, the energy to build one plus everybody laughs at me if I do so
[45:19.560 --> 45:27.040]  I guess we'll all just take nation eye down and try to survive here, but it's just amazing
[45:27.040 --> 45:31.080]  I said I'd go to your phone call, so no time left for negotiations, Iran is on course with
[45:31.080 --> 45:35.360]  a nuclear bomb within six months and time has run out for further negotiations senior
[45:35.360 --> 45:43.760]  Israeli officials said and that's strategic affairs minister Yuval Steinitz said Iran
[45:43.760 --> 45:48.840]  will still believe it had room for the mover in dealing with world powers and that unless
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.120]  it faces a credible threat from the US military actions it would not stop its nuclear activities
[45:53.120 --> 45:57.480]  folks you can't build nuclear weapons with the systems they've got, the word I've got
[45:57.480 --> 46:02.160]  for my military sources is Iran already has nuclear weapons, they got them from Russian
[46:02.160 --> 46:09.600]  sources over a decade ago, Pakistan's got about 90 weapons, that's on record I mean
[46:09.600 --> 46:19.960]  you just come on, Iran's already got atomic bombs ladies and gentlemen, okay, let's just
[46:19.960 --> 46:25.280]  get that out of the way here, they've already got weapons and Israel and the United States
[46:25.280 --> 46:32.280]  want to take those weapons out, that's what's really going on, Iran has had its refineries
[46:32.280 --> 46:36.920]  and equipment blocked for decades and they've had the refineries blown up and bombed by
[46:36.920 --> 46:40.960]  western saboteur teams that have been publicly operating for eight years inside the country,
[46:40.960 --> 46:47.960]  Iran's suing the US over that right now, they need nuclear power to run their electricity,
[46:47.960 --> 46:52.800]  they want real reactors, they already have nuclear weapons from my sources and my sources
[46:52.800 --> 46:59.680]  have not been wrong yet, that's why the Joint Chiefs do not want a war with Iran because
[46:59.680 --> 47:05.240]  the word is they're going to use those nuclear weapons and Israel knows that and that iron
[47:05.240 --> 47:10.720]  dome folks may not stop a nuke or it may just detonate or be the equivalent of a dirty bomb,
[47:10.720 --> 47:15.400]  see you could war game this all day, let me just say this to everybody, the chairman
[47:15.400 --> 47:20.080]  of the Joint Chiefs who was hired because the last three wouldn't start World War III,
[47:20.080 --> 47:25.600]  Dempsey was put in position because he's known as a not too smart guy that will follow orders,
[47:25.600 --> 47:30.840]  he showed up weeks ago at midnight on record to tell Obama you got to call this a strike
[47:30.840 --> 47:39.200]  off that's starting in six hours, you understand?
[47:39.200 --> 47:44.520]  He showed up and said you've got to stop the strike and that's even in the Washington
[47:44.520 --> 47:49.960]  Post yesterday, now why did the entire Joint Chiefs tell him don't do this because there's
[47:49.960 --> 47:56.840]  a good chance World War III is going to happen, okay and look no one challenges that Israel
[47:56.840 --> 48:02.000]  has got a lot of nerve okay and that the West has a lot of nerve, everybody else okay, we
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.840]  don't need to show off and have World War III, we don't need to show the Iranians how
[48:06.840 --> 48:11.320]  tough you are that you're willing to go in your bunkers while we all die and the Iranians
[48:11.320 --> 48:20.200]  you know them they're going to go ahead and do, I mean it's just a bad situation and Israel
[48:20.200 --> 48:25.440]  comes out and calls Iranian presidents nuclear commiss deceptive when they said we are not
[48:25.440 --> 48:30.160]  seeking nuclear weapons, well yeah the reason it's deceptive is because it's a peaceful
[48:30.160 --> 48:35.880]  program they're developing they've already got them, Israel said on Thursday and I have
[48:35.880 --> 48:44.480]  that from, well I think I could say where I have that from high level special forces
[48:44.480 --> 48:52.400]  command and I've known that for a decade and I've confirmed it, they've got satellites
[48:52.400 --> 48:57.080]  and systems that pick it up folks, there's Russian nukes inside Iran, Iran already has
[48:57.080 --> 49:01.280]  nukes folks, that's why they're talking about using tactical nukes to take out those mountain
[49:01.280 --> 49:06.920]  fortresses entering the news going nukes aren't that bad, nukes aren't that big of a deal,
[49:06.920 --> 49:11.440]  they're looking at World War II suicide type missions for US special forces if they're
[49:11.440 --> 49:15.920]  unable to take it out to try to send commando groups in that's been looked at, that's one
[49:15.920 --> 49:20.520]  reason that the Joint Chiefs are so freaked out, I mean how did it work for Delta Force
[49:20.520 --> 49:27.360]  and the hostages rescue in Iran, I mean this is madness ladies and gentlemen and yeah there
[49:27.360 --> 49:31.840]  were cases where they had parachuted special forces, British and USN in World War II and
[49:31.840 --> 49:36.520]  they would ski 50 miles over land and go in and blow up Hitler missile silos and stuff
[49:36.520 --> 49:41.400]  where they were working on nukes, blow up their heavy water facilities, blow up ships
[49:41.400 --> 49:47.160]  carrying heavy water, but I mean you know the whole point is I'm going to go to Britain
[49:47.160 --> 49:53.400]  and come back and take your calls and then we've got the mayor, for some reason Debra
[49:53.400 --> 49:58.640]  Tavares, she just called, we got some type of time zone mix up, we'll get her on next
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.440]  week, I'm going to get her on for a full hour, so we'll get that scheduled, we just had
[50:02.440 --> 50:05.800]  some time zone thing, she just called in but it's too late now and then the former mayor
[50:05.800 --> 50:09.560]  of Salt Lake on NSA spying, they caught the whole city being surveilled, he's coming on
[50:09.560 --> 50:13.560]  Dr. Paul McCrack Roberts on the QE Unlimited, will it really cause the implosion next year
[50:13.560 --> 50:18.000]  like Mark Fauber and I had that stack yesterday of economists saying that, we pull that for
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.480]  me thanks and Ron Paul and then we're going to get Mike Adams in studio, our good neighbor
[50:23.480 --> 50:28.800]  who goes right outside Austin, such an asset to have Mike Adams, the health ranger of natural
[50:28.800 --> 50:36.480]  news.com so close to Austin, so he's going to be here in studio with us and we are going
[50:36.480 --> 50:42.440]  to be breaking down so much more, you know I haven't wanted to add to pro-war propaganda,
[50:42.440 --> 50:48.560]  that's why I never told you that my sources say that Iran has nukes and delivery systems,
[50:48.560 --> 50:56.240]  but Israel knows that, our Pentagon knows that and that's why this is such a serious
[50:56.240 --> 51:00.920]  situation, we're trying to start World War 3, we'll be right back.

[53:09.320 --> 53:16.360]  autism and every other major disease, it all comes down to one thing, we are what we eat,
[53:16.360 --> 53:22.040]  our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives, our water is filled

[54:33.040 --> 54:38.000]  we're going to get him on at two o'clock today and to overdrive, if he can do it.
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.920]  I want to go to your calls in this segment and the next and continuing throughout the
[54:42.920 --> 54:48.680]  broadcast, there's some good news too, even AP Reuters are all reporting that basically
[54:48.680 --> 54:53.280]  entire climate change fraud has collapsed, all the computer models are confirmed to
[54:53.280 --> 54:59.720]  be fraudulent, we already knew that, there's been a decline over 15 years in temperature
[54:59.720 --> 55:03.320]  and we're actually going to go into a cooling period and they admit that the sun was taken
[55:03.320 --> 55:09.160]  out of the equation, that it's all a fraud, so that is all collapsing, I know it collapsed
[55:09.160 --> 55:16.000]  for us a long time ago, okay, but I mean this is a route, ladies and gentlemen, but the
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.200]  problem is they don't care, they're still just shutting down the power plants, but
[55:20.200 --> 55:25.920]  at least we now know it's all based on fraud, now get the word out, it's a power grab.
[55:25.920 --> 55:30.800]  We've got that news, but let's go to your phone calls right now, let's talk to Tron
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.440]  in Florida, you're on the air Tron, I'll see you on the game grid.
[55:35.440 --> 55:41.600]  Hey, how you doing Alex, I'm calling for region four, Miami, Florida, I'm in the slums
[55:41.600 --> 55:46.080]  in the ghetto down here, you know, I grew up in the drug and sex area, as we speak right
[55:46.080 --> 55:51.720]  now, I'm outside and I see like undercover detectives and unmarked cars are hiding around
[55:51.720 --> 55:56.240]  the neighborhood, they do this every, almost like three times a week, they ride around,
[55:56.240 --> 56:00.680]  they randomly stop cars, they stop people that's on bikes, they stop people that's on
[56:00.680 --> 56:04.920]  foot, searching for drugs, they search you no more, there's no, nothing, you know.
[56:04.920 --> 56:09.960]  Well, they want to find the drugs, they need to go to the C-130's landing there at the
[56:09.960 --> 56:16.200]  special forces command in Tampa and they can get all the drugs right there.
[56:16.200 --> 56:20.440]  You know, it's just crazy because they don't want the drugs off the streets, because if
[56:20.440 --> 56:23.280]  the drugs off the street, they wouldn't have this talk, but they're riding around in their
[56:23.280 --> 56:25.360]  unmarked cars, jumping out on people.
[56:25.360 --> 56:30.720]  Well, no, no, I mean, they're all, they're skimming the top of it, I mean that said 100%
[56:30.720 --> 56:36.480]  of the other drug agents, Cerberus said in New York in the 60s, were the drug dealers,
[56:36.480 --> 56:41.720]  they're there just to make sure that the right people are slinging the goods.
[56:41.720 --> 56:45.880]  And it's crazy too, because about a month and a half ago, I got arrested for, I had
[56:45.880 --> 56:51.920]  a clean record, no, no, no warrants out for my arrest, I was on my way home one night
[56:51.920 --> 56:58.280]  from a friend's house, his car pulls me over, I pulled over, he's in the big F-150 truck,
[56:58.280 --> 57:02.880]  he hops out all mad, asking me why it took so long to pull over, I'm telling him, there's
[57:02.880 --> 57:06.640]  a one way to get in my neighborhood, it's a one-way street, I'm not going to block
[57:06.640 --> 57:10.720]  this traffic, so I pull it up a little bit, so he gets all mad and say, oh, where's the
[57:10.720 --> 57:13.480]  drugs, where's the drugs, do you have any weed in here, I'm like, there's no drugs,
[57:13.480 --> 57:17.000]  they don't have any drugs, so he looks at me, gives me this look like I'm lying, so
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.840]  I'm telling him, I don't have anything, Cerberus nothing in here, so he said, oh, do you want
[57:20.840 --> 57:24.560]  to go to jail tonight, or do you want to PTA, and I say, for what, he said, you know what,
[57:24.560 --> 57:27.360]  just get out of the car, so I get out of the car, and...
[57:27.360 --> 57:30.720]  No, no, that's the new thing, as you get pulled over and they go, you're going to
[57:30.720 --> 57:34.900]  breathalyze, you're going to give blood, and then if you don't get down and start sucking
[57:34.900 --> 57:39.440]  on their boots, you go to jail, but now in Texas, that's not even enough, they binge
[57:39.440 --> 57:44.800]  over the car and start ramming their hand inside your body, and I'm sorry, I am evil,
[57:44.800 --> 57:49.840]  I'm not letting the state police stick their finger up my rear end, I mean, I'm sorry.
[57:49.840 --> 57:53.000]  And you're not evil because you're not letting them put your hands in the air.
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.880]  No, no, no, no, that's going to be the new salute though, instead of shaking hands, what
[57:56.880 --> 58:00.480]  you, the new thing just to show you're not dangerous, when you see a cop is, you just
[58:00.480 --> 58:02.520]  bend over, I'm serious.
[58:02.520 --> 58:06.080]  I'm not joking, I mean, in America now, that's what you do, in fact, I'm going to start,
[58:06.080 --> 58:09.360]  maybe we should do a comedy video where we walk up to cops and like, actually they'll
[58:09.360 --> 58:14.520]  arrest you for flatulence, have you seen that, where they arrest people all the time now,
[58:14.520 --> 58:20.720]  they, but you can't even spin 100 yards away, that we should all just kill ourselves so
[58:20.720 --> 58:24.960]  the cops can have the earth, everybody should just chop their heads off, I'm joking folks,
[58:24.960 --> 58:28.440]  don't kill yourselves, and most cops actually aren't bad, but it is the government culture
[58:28.440 --> 58:29.440]  of arrogance.
[58:29.440 --> 58:35.120]  Sir, you're just lucky that you got taken to jail, Nick, come to Texas, they'll give

[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.040]  need to have a proctology exam, state police are now expert proctologists.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:20.640]  Well that's funny you say that, but I got a few things to say, if what you're saying
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.760]  is true, no one warned American people, right, and they want to fall dead under agenda 21,
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.840]  what's the problem with fighting fire with fire, we know where these cowards are at,
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.600]  every year, same time of the year, they go down to Bohemian Grove, they put on their
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.600]  little cremation of care, you know, what are the cowardly American people waiting for,
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.280]  a fuck, an imitation.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.400]  So what are you suggesting we do?
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.400]  Well 17 states.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:53.400]  I suggest they have the state police out there, the chips that protect them, we don't know
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.600]  if they're not terrorists, they all need proctology exams.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.720]  We know who the real terrorists are, the ones who are studying agenda 21.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.240]  How do we know Henry Kissinger doesn't have a hanger-nade up his rear end?
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.560]  I ain't scared of these people.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:10.880]  I mean, they say we're all suspected terrorists, I know he's a real terrorist, he's been convicted
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.880]  or criminal.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:17.440]  I'm just sick of standing by watching cowards pay their taxes, go to work, feeding into the
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.680]  greed of America, it's disgusting, people are hungry, people are dying, but yet people
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.000]  want Mercedes-Benz and Ferraris.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.120]  Well that is why America's put up with so much, is that Liberty created so much wealth,
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.680]  now we're actually debtor nation, but for a while it was Liberty produced the wealth,
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.680]  now we got into debt thinking that was the new wealth, but I'm telling you the ship's
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.720]  all about to go under, and so we better be getting the word out about an alternative
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.280]  system to this tyranny, I hear you brother, but the globalist stage violence to make themselves
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:53.520]  look like the victim, so we shouldn't be violent offensively, it's not just a right, it's a
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:58.080]  duty defensively to defend yourself.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:03.880]  So we need to be working as hard as we can today, because folks are always saying, what
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.800]  are people waiting for, we need to go physically after people, but it's always those folks
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.600]  that are saying that that aren't physically doing it, they're telling us we need to physically
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.080]  do it, and I understand you're frustrated, you might actually have it in you to go do
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:19.720]  something physical, look don't do that, okay, don't do that.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.720]  We already had one listener going to Bohemian Grove and set things on fire and that didn't
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:29.120]  go too well, I guess please don't do anything folks, and that looked like a sigh up though,
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.680]  he went in the middle of the winter when nobody was there, dressed up in a superhero outfit,
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:40.400]  he was a marine, and I'll tell you, I don't know, it looked pretty set up to me, but Richard
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.640]  McCaslin was his name, we got to get him on the show sometime, I'll openly ask him, what
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.920]  were you thinking, let's talk to Kevin in New York, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:57.480]  Hey Alex, I've been listening since August, when I saw you on conspiracy theory with Jesse
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:03.680]  Minthera, saw you, got very interested right away, started listening, and when I heard
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:10.280]  you talk about the mercury in the burp shops, I got very, very scared, because I just had
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:17.640]  a baby girl on Sunday, and I was like, yeah that's a shot, it's for the earth, oh, yeah,
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.720]  so I got really scared right away when they just took her, after 10 minutes of being born,
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:28.360]  and they gave her a vitamin K, and so I was very skeptical about that, so I saw it, made
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.520]  sure it was what they said it was.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.400]  Yeah, there's still a lot of studies that that didn't do good, but it's nothing compared
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:39.200]  to the other, let me ask you this question real quick, did they give her the hep B shot?
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.960]  Yeah, they gave that later at night, I was skeptical about that too, what they said eventually
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.040]  she was going to need that for school, well number one that's not true, and it's for
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:52.880]  sexually transmitted diseases, and it's a very dangerous vaccine, you know you had
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.880]  a right to say no, right?
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.800]  Yeah, I just, I tried calling you earlier, I didn't know what to do, so I'm going to
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.040]  come back to you later, just why does the United States spend the largest percentage
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:08.320]  of GDP in the world on healthcare, why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet,
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:14.680]  the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease, it all comes down
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:20.440]  to one thing, we are what we eat, our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:26.360]  poisons and additives, our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff,
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:31.520]  all of this has been engineered by design, we can turn the tide against the eugenicist

[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.480]  for us?
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:10.160]  As we move through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:16.760]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.760]  psyche.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:23.320]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.920]  perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.120]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:39.180]  verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness, how to engineer the opinion
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:47.720]  of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war, state of mind
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:54.440]  because there's a war on for your mind, get your copy of state of mind the movie at infowars.com

[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.400]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.840]  mean that we're running up our debt.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:20.680]  Raising the debt ceiling which has been done over a hundred times does not increase our
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.680]  debt.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.800]  It does not somehow promote profligacy.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:35.160]  All it does is it says you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up Congress.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:44.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.760]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:57.960]  If you believe that raising the debt limit does not raise the debt, you believe water
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:03.840]  isn't wet and that the sun didn't come up this morning or that you believe Bill Clinton
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.760]  is a truthful person or you believe George W. Bush really thought there were WMDs in
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.680]  Iraq and I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.680]  It's called the Golden Gate Bridge.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:13.680]  I'll sell it to you for $100.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.960]  Just give me $100, you can have it.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:17.960]  Unbelievable.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:23.120]  We're going to talk about former Salt Lake City mayor, NSA's 2002 Olympic spying scandal
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120]  of the century.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.720]  We're getting former mayor on in here in just a few minutes, Rocky Anderson.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:32.960]  First off, the big news is Senator Lindsey Graham is running around trying to get a resolution
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:39.040]  pass to give Obama carte blanche power to start World War III with Iran and that's what
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.080]  the Joint Chiefs of Staff have said don't do it.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:47.720]  It's a very bad idea and Israel has come out and at least the Israeli leadership and
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.680]  said that they want a strike on Iran, that they want pressure put on there, the pressure
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.560]  of a threat of a strike.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:59.040]  Meanwhile, the precious al-Qaeda rebels are killing the other rebels, the Wall Street Journal
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.120]  reports rebel on rebel violence in Syria.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:08.440]  What a terrible crisis that is and Syria may miss first deadline in U.S. Russia chemical
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:13.120]  arms deal to not strike because the rebels are in and around the areas where the chemical
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.920]  weapons are and it's hard to transport them and I actually believe that.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:22.760]  This is a serious, serious situation and later we have this report, hateful professor says
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:29.680]  NRA members children should be next to die in mass shooting.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:34.360]  Sounds like the talking points we've heard out of Michael Moore saying, you know, and
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.600]  we need people's kids to die so they understand this is really creepy.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.600]  It's not our fault.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.760]  There's all this gang related stuff going on in Chicago where you have victim disarmament
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:49.280]  and we're going to have former head of policy and the Treasury for Ronald Reagan on to talk
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.440]  about QE's unlimited by the Fed will lead to total collapse.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.160]  That's what a lot of experts are saying.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.840]  We're going to have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on at the bottom of the hour briefly for
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.280]  like 10 minutes and then continue with your calls.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.640]  But I wanted to get him on because we appreciate his courage and standing up for the Fourth
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.520]  Amendment and basic due process.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:14.680]  Rocky Anderson, the elected mayor of Salt Lake City for two four-year terms from 2000
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:21.480]  to 2008 and ran the city during obviously the Olympics has told the public that the
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:27.840]  NSA was surveilling the entire city during that and of course the excuse as well as to
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.280]  protect you from terrorists.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:35.280]  But the point is, is it just sets the precedent for there to be absolutely no Fourth Amendment
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.640]  like we're living in North Korea.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:43.320]  And so he joins us, he now teaches at the University of Utah about the radical transformation
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.920]  of the constitutional republic in the US during the Bush Obama years and about the media and
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.240]  mass deception.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:54.280]  He continues his vigorous advocacy on behalf of climate protection and cleaning up corrupt
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.760]  electoral system and reform of our criminal justice system, including elimination of mandatory
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.440]  minimum sentences and the decriminalization of drugs.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.880]  I like that part because the government runs in the drugs.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.120]  Mayor, former mayor, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:13.320]  Alex, I appreciate the opportunity because if we don't have this dialogue, if people
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:21.360]  aren't aware of what is happening to our constitutional republic, how radically it is being transformed,
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.880]  we're just going to all be sitting by passively when these people have their way.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:31.720]  And we're going to people finally wake up one day and see that this is no longer anything
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:35.000]  close to the United States of America.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.040]  And I want to make one thing clear, you described the surveillance in Salt Lake City by the NSA
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.040]  prior to the Olympics.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:50.960]  This was in 2001 and 2002 for a period of up to six months before and during the Olympics.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:56.960]  And this wasn't just metadata, which is just getting the names and who called whom or who
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.840]  wrote to whom.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:12.720]  This was the most massive compilation spying on the contents of the largest number of Americans
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:18.200]  ever without any cops, without a warrant, without any notice.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:26.680]  They captured the contents of every single text message and every single email of everyone
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.840]  within the Salt Lake City area.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:35.880]  It was absolutely a not only clear violation of the Constitution, of course, but every
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:42.080]  instance of this was a federal felony under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.600]  And there's a videotape that I've got and it's available online.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.480]  You can just go to YouTube and find it.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:59.360]  Bush saying in 2004, oh, by the way, the Fourth Amendment still applies and in every instance
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:06.080]  in our fight against terror, we get a warrant in every single instance because it's required
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.320]  by the Constitution and we value the Constitution.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:16.440]  That's what he said in 2004 and yet for years he had ordered the NSA just disregard the
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:21.720]  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that was passed by Congress to prevent this very
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:28.520]  kind of thing after all the disclosures by the church committee in the Senate.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:33.080]  They found that the intelligence community had been engaged in this kind of misconduct
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.680]  during the Cold War and they said, we're going to put a stop to it.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:44.720]  So fundamentally, this not only goes to our privacy rights and the baloney is conduct
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:50.840]  by governmental agents, it really goes to the question of whether we have the rule of
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:57.080]  law in the United States because if there is no accountability, if there's no prosecution
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:04.160]  for people for violating these laws, if as President Obama indicated, as soon as he came
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:08.040]  in as president, that oh, we're just going to look forward and not look backwards as
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:15.240]  people who torture in violation not only of international law but in violation of our
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:22.160]  own domestic statutes, the War Crimes Act of 1996 and the federal anti-torture statute
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:28.320]  and as to those who engaged in the illegal surveillance during the Bush administration,
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:35.200]  let's just forget about them, those are the words of a tyrant when one person can determine
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.640]  when, under what circumstances and to whom, our laws are going to be applied.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.640]  You're absolutely right.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:46.280]  This is saying that there are people that really are above the law in the United States.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:51.960]  Nixon was right when he talked to David Frost and said, well, when the president does it,
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.880]  that means it's not illegal.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.280]  That is the essence of tyranny.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.280]  Why not have a Fuhrer?
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.000]  Why not have a Kaiser, a King, a Tsar?
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.160]  And again, if you just joined us, it's rockyandersonjustice.com.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.520]  I want to get you on for a full hour in the near future if you can, Mayor, because you
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.720]  can hear the fire of liberty in your voice.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:16.560]  You can tell it's in your heart, your gut, your mind, and people need to know we're
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560]  threatened by this.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:21.800]  We're told, give up all your liberties or let us do all this illegal stuff to keep you
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:22.800]  safe.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:28.880]  But the great threat historically is when governments do this, it always becomes a tyranny.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.480]  They always abuse it.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.160]  They always target their enemies.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.240]  And now it's bipartisan.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:40.600]  And now we learn they use the NSA on the press, on the Tea Party, the IRS on people just like
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.680]  Nixon did his enemies.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:45.560]  And except this time, nobody's getting in trouble.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.120]  So if they don't get in trouble, the precedent is set.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.600]  And I know now you tirelessly fight to warn people.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.440]  Historically, sir, what do we know is going to happen if no one is held accountable for
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.440]  this?
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:03.400]  Well, without accountability, it's Katie bar the door.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.520]  It's like with the war power.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.320]  Alex, the war power is exclusively Congress's.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.520]  It's not for the president.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.520]  Madison, Jefferson, Hamilton, they all made it clear.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:23.480]  Hamilton made it clear in federalist 69 that the president is merely the first general
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.560]  or admiral.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:31.280]  Hamilton said the greatest wisdom in the Constitution was found in that clause that
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:37.960]  leaves it for Congress and not the president to decide whether we will engage our military.
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:38.960]  And what does it become?
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:46.200]  And you see, people talk about precedent while Truman did it, and acting illegally, acting
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.640]  unconstitutionally is not valid precedent.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:55.240]  Well, that's what's saying that he has the power to do this.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.240]  That is a tyranny.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.240]  The founder said, we're going to get away from that.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.240]  King George makes those decisions.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:03.840]  Well, in the United States, it's going to be Congress.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.480]  It's going to be the people's representatives.
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.560]  And we're losing all of that.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:15.520]  We've got a president who adds U.S. citizens to assassination lists now, no due process,
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:20.400]  and then he asks for the power, and Congress gives it to him for the federal government
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.120]  to go out and kidnap, disappear.
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:27.360]  And we use the sterile term and definitely detain.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.040]  What that means is imprisoning people for up to the rest of their lives with no legal
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.200]  representation, no charges, no trial.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:41.760]  It is the most subversive act, no more un-American act ever in the history of this country.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.760]  You're right.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:46.760]  And I see America is starting to wake up, and I know you're leading a national campaign
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:53.320]  and founding a new national party, the Justice Party, to try to educate people on this.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.400]  But I do see some silver lining.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.960]  I'm seeing a mass awakening across the political spectrum.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.880]  Are you starting to see that as well, Mayor?
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:08.520]  I'm really not, because if there were a mass awakening, we would have masses out in the
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.520]  streets.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.840]  We would have the equivalent of the civil rights movement, the women's suffrage movement,
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:21.720]  the labor movement, we would have people rising up and letting every one of our representatives
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:28.280]  know, including the two duopolis parties, Republican Democratic parties who have brought
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:34.520]  us to this state, because they're such total prostitutes, all they care about is the corporate
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.360]  interest by their way into Congress.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360]  That's right.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.360]  Hold on.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.360]  Stay there, Mayor.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.360]  We'll come back with one more segment with you.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.080]  I don't want to get you on for full hours, and if you can do it, very eloquent words.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:48.840]  There is a mass awakening, and then out of the awakening leads the mass action.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:54.840]  But I am seeing people really get up, look, 91% in Reuters polls against the Syria strike,
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:58.560]  the Joint Chiefs telling Obama, no, I mean, we're seeing some unprecedented stuff.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:01.480]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.400]  Great news, pure water lovers.

[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:10.080]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.960]  Burglars call it smash and grab, police call it robbery, we call it avoidable.

[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:08.480]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.480]  to serve as debt.
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:13.000]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.240]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:20.040]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:46.600]  We have six minutes left in this short segment and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us on the
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.880]  Q and a limited and what it really means for the economy because even mainline media says
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.440]  it's horrible news in the next year.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:59.120]  I hope that's not the case, but going back to you, sir, front and center, I'm not arguing
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.840]  with you, but yeah, it's not like a civil rights movement or it's not like, but I mean
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.680]  I am seeing people now listen to what I say.
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.360]  I'm seeing most people agree with us.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.040]  I'm seeing people against the wars.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.320]  I mean, I am seeing some positive signs.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:19.160]  I agree with that if people are asked to give their opinions or they'll do their mouse click
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:23.920]  activism and put their names on petitions, but it's going to take a lot more than that
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:29.800]  because Congress can just write us all off as long as they know they've got their financial
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:35.400]  supporters, their sponsors, their people who have their way with Congress and the White
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.960]  House simply by writing out the checks.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.680]  We've got to all stand up against this corrupting influence of money against military industrial
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:51.440]  complex against the control of healthcare policy by the insurance companies by the pharmaceutical
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:26:00.080]  industry and the fossil fuel industry control over our energy and climate policies.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:06.440]  It just goes to the heart of what's so wrong about this country and in the meantime, we're
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:11.320]  losing what is at the root of our Constitution.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:17.640]  Whoever thought, Alex, in our lifetime, it's just the Soviet Union invaded us and put in
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:26.800]  place the KGB except we have far more dangerous and effective technology that the NSA is using.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:33.400]  And I think the really dangerous part of this is we still have the pretense of being a Constitution.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:40.240]  Really everybody knows historically it's the archetype of tyranny that be spied on illegally
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.240]  and now it's just complete and now Apple has suicide nets in its factories, but it's liberal
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:53.880]  and the neocons want World War III, it's madness, madness in the power structure.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:57.720]  This NSA stuff is getting used on them as well, they're being blackmailed.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:00.880]  How do we get out of this?
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:07.640]  What it's going to take is for us all to get beyond our other differences, the wedge issues,
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:12.960]  the Fox News folks and a lot of the rest in the mainstream media, walks to stir up to
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:18.320]  make it look like we've really got two main political parties because these two political
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:25.080]  parties are a duopoly that's taking control of our entire political system.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:30.120]  They're profiting from the corruption in our government and yeah, they may argue back
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:37.480]  day rights and abortion or whatever, but they're national security, so-called policy, they're
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:46.040]  for an empire, desire for empire, wanting to dominate militarily and economically around
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.560]  the world, they're totally in line on that.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:55.080]  Exactly, and they will use us up, they will use us up to build their empire, so I think
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:00.840]  we tell that narrative the truth of why we're being sucked dry and why it's so immoral and
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:01.960]  I think we can turn it around.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:06.680]  The problem is they want to use homeland security against political speech to shut down their
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:11.880]  opposition and so then I see that leading into something even more serious.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:15.560]  And we have seen that in our nation's history and we're embarrassed by it.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:24.120]  We look back at the Sedition Acts in this country, the Espionage Act, prosecutions and
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.240]  we say, oh, how could that have ever happened in the United States?
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.720]  Isn't it great that we've become so much freer?
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.720]  We're not.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.220]  Obama's using it on the press.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:41.040]  Back to that point now, the alien and Sedition Acts, the more prosecutions for the disclosure
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:47.960]  of documents that are more confidential, more prosecutions under this administration
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.960]  than under every other prior administration combined.
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:58.240]  So these folks that have put it all on the line, like Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:04.520]  and others who aren't as well known but who have gone to prison because of whistleblowing
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:11.400]  on the NSA and on the CIA, true heroes who did this knowing what they were personally
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:16.040]  putting on the line, like Daniel Ellsberg did so many years ago with disclosure of the
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:22.960]  Pentagon Papers so that we, the people, would know what our government is up to.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.240]  We ought to be praising them.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:29.240]  We ought to be all standing up and saying, you know, you are on our side, our government
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:33.240]  should start fearing us rather than us fearing our government.
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.960]  Rocky Anderson, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.840]  I hope everybody visits your site.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:42.960]  We have it linked up on infowars.com and we'll talk to you again in a few weeks to do a full
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.960]  hour.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:44.960]  Thank you.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.960]  Great.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:49.000]  I want to break down what's really happening with the economy, what QE Unlimited means
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  to you.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.720]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:30:01.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:06.480]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, pure silver continues to be one of nature's most
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:13.360]  reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.920]  and parasites.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:19.840]  With Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy to use full production system for
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:24.720]  creating endless pure nano-silver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.720]  your home.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:30.520]  Your self-produced nano-silver solutions can be applied topically to the skin.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:35.080]  For many who are new to silver that wish to try silver for the first time, we offer a
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:40.880]  full line of consumables and cosmetics, such as our two-ounce nano-silver nasal sprays,
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:47.400]  our nano-silver soap, and our most popular product, the all-natural nano-silver gel.

[01:30:53.920 --> 01:31:01.000]  Lungs system, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.560]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:11.680]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged. You can even make your own colloidal
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:13.820]  silver at home in your garage.
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:17.820]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:23.920]  Supernatural silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:28.280]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:33.720]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:39.960]  silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:44.840]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:49.600]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly

[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:36.960]  Come into you from the Infowars.com studios, deep in the heart of Texas, Austin. I'm your
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:40.160]  host. We're going to talk for about 10, 15 minutes to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, and go
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:46.240]  back to all of you that are patiently holding. Kevin wants to ask about just having a baby
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:50.560]  and has a question about vaccines. I'll tell you what I do with my family. Once we go to
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:57.520]  you, we have a lot of other NSA news breaking today and some very important news dealing
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.840]  with the U.N. and others having to admit they were using fraudulent models on purpose
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:07.760]  to push global carbon taxes. I know that's old news for us here, but this is now just
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:13.200]  breaking everywhere, all part of the age of awakening that we're seeing here. The question
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:17.200]  is, will the age of awakening be able to push us through the age of tyranny? Because the
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:21.320]  two are happening together towards the singularity. Things are happening faster and faster. We're
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:25.360]  one of those spasmodic points in history. We're going to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on two big
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:32.160]  issues, the latest on Syria, Russia, and then of course what's happening with QE Unlimited.
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.840]  Are they going to taper? Will they taper? Why are all the people I respect like Ron Paul
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:42.840]  and Mark Fawber and others saying curtains by the middle of next year? I hope that's
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:47.560]  not the case. We have a top economist, Dr. Roberts, coming up in a moment. First off,
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:52.120]  I want to thank all of you out there, the listeners and viewers. We have done something
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:57.400]  that no one else has been able to do and they've had everything from New York Magazine to Rolling
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:06.080]  Stone to the New York Times to Nightline to Talkers Magazine to other big trade publications.
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:11.000]  On record say, we've built something here without Fox News help or without Claire Channel
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.920]  like Glenn Beck did. Great for Glenn Beck. I want people to be successful. I'm not in
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:20.200]  competition with him. I don't want to have World War III. We have built something literally
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:26.600]  from my cell phone access TV 18 years ago and I've looked at the math over 18 years.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:32.760]  I've put $37 million the profits back into this. It costs about $6 million to run this
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:37.480]  a year now. That sounds like a lot of money for the bang for the buck. It's not. Other
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:42.760]  media groups that reach 15 million people a week on average are spending 10, 20, 30 million
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:47.200]  a year. Some of these news divisions, hundreds of millions a year. So by the grace of God
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:52.120]  on a shoestring budget, we now reach 15 million people a week, one way or the other globally.
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:57.160]  We don't have some target audience. We have an audience that's the whole world. That's
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:00.920]  our mission and that's why we've been successful and we have a big nut to crack every year.
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:05.440]  I'm spending more money right now than I even bring in, but we had some emergency reserves
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:08.120]  and we've got a bunch of stuff that's about to happen that will push us through to the
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.120]  next level.
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:13.720]  But thank you all for your support. When you buy the great t-shirts, the Liberty-based
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:17.680]  t-shirts, when you get the films, the books, you don't just get a great film or a great
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.080]  book or a great water filter at a discounted price. We carry the best products, the lowest
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:28.200]  prices, non-GMO, a huge selection of high quality seeds, the biggest out there, again
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:34.560]  the lowest prices. You are funding a true grassroots operation that is beholden to no
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:39.400]  one but common sense and survival. I got two daughters and a son. I want them to have
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:46.320]  a future. That's what pushes my buttons. I instinctively don't like tyrants and bullies
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:52.400]  never had and never will and thank God for all of you. I am so thankful that you have
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:56.640]  PrisonPlanet.tv memberships to see the nightly news, that you buy the books, the videos, that
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:03.000]  you support our sponsors, that all the different ways we're able to pay for this operation
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.720]  by also putting out educational materials that help spread the word. So buy your war
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:14.040]  bonds. We're not like MSNBC, they get stimulus money or NPR or News Corps that through their
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:17.360]  media divisions gets government propaganda money for their films, then goes into their
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:22.720]  news division. It's all one way or another taxpayer money. We are truly funded by viewers
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:27.720]  and radio listeners like you. So please, please shop with the good guys, the best vitamins,

[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:11.800]  Yeah, the forefathers had their fight for liberty and others had their battles. We're
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:17.400]  now living. We're just like them. We have just as much potential if we take action.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:22.720]  America was exceptional. Now we're exceptionally evil. I want to be exceptionally good and
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:29.280]  be the renaissance, the light of the world again, not the darkness. And we're also a
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:36.520]  platform for all these amazing people to be able to come on with us. Folks like Dr. Paul
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:41.240]  Craig Roberts who joins us and I appreciate him spending time with us, syndicated columnist,
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:46.880]  former head of policy department of the Treasury, father to Reaganomics, a top economist. You
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:55.040]  can also go to his website. We'll put that URL up on screen for everyone as well where
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:59.680]  you can read his articles. He also allows us to re-syndicate them at infowars.com.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:06.120]  I wanted to get him on to really break this down because Mark Fauber and Ron Paul and
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:10.920]  all these other experts, here's the headlines. Experts, Fed's QE Unlimited will lead to total
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:16.960]  collapse. That's a quote. Ron Paul came out on Fox and said Bernanke admits economies
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:24.160]  quote in bad shape. That's a quote. Fed announcement may mean beginning of end of QE 3. Then they
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:30.160]  said, well, no, it's not. This is very technical stuff, but most of the experts that have been
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:36.800]  right in the past say this spell is a major correction middle of next year. I try to study
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:40.200]  this and don't understand it all. So that's why we're bringing people like Dr. Paul Craig
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.840]  Roberts. We'll look at this briefly. Then we'll look at the geopolitical and get an
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:48.720]  update on what he thinks is happening there. But Doc, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.720]  Please do, Alex.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:54.480]  Well, you just heard my question there. What's happening? Why is there all this concern over
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.480]  the QE Unlimited?
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:02.040]  That's a good question. It shouldn't be. The Fed has made it clear it's not going to stop
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:11.320]  earning money to buy the bonds until its benchmarks are met. And those are specified in terms of
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:19.080]  the unemployment rate and the real GDP growth rate. And the economy is nowhere in year either.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:26.440]  So and it's not going to be. So the QE will continue. I have no idea why the big banks
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:34.200]  like Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, why they put out all this propaganda about tapering.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:40.880]  Bernanke has made it very clear he's not going to do anything like that until he has a firm
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:49.720]  recovery. But he can't stop because the entire financial system now is rigged based on the
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:56.640]  bond purchases by the Fed. So if they stop purchasing the bonds, the prices will fall,
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:01.280]  the interest rates will go up, the bond market will collapse, the stock market will collapse,
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:07.880]  the balance sheets of the big banks too big to fail will turn insolvent again, and the
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:13.160]  whole system will come down. So he can't stop because in the short run, the immediate
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:21.400]  effect would be disaster. The long run effect, of course, will also be disaster because eventually
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:27.440]  printing all of these new dollars will scare the rest of the world away from the dollar.
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:32.680]  And as they leave the dollar, the exchange value and the dollar will collapse and then
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:39.080]  the Fed will lose control. So they're going to lose control. If they stop QE, they'll
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:48.960]  lose control in the short run. If they continue QE, they will lose control later on.
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:55.680]  I don't remember in recent memory having the Obama administration and the media saying
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:00.680]  we're going to begin tapering, and then you have the Fed coming out and saying we're not
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:09.160]  going to in the same day, and we see Obama conflicting with Kerry on serious statements.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:14.120]  This looks like a bunch of different special interests fighting with each other. Is that
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.120]  accurate?
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:22.760]  I don't really know. It's not up to Obama what the Fed does. And the Fed's made it
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:32.320]  clear that it's going to save the big banks. So I think what the outcome will be, the Fed
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:38.640]  puts off the collapse of the big banks for a while, but the cost of that is everyone's
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:45.360]  collapse. The banks and everyone else's. Only it comes later.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:53.040]  Now about Syria, I don't really think that the Israel lobby has given up on the war.
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:43:00.480]  I don't think the neoconservatives have given up. They have a strategic agent inside the
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:08.880]  Obama regime. Susan Rice, the National Security Advisor. I don't think the neocon agent at
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:15.880]  the UN, Samantha Powers or whatever her name is, they haven't given up on their war. They
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:24.320]  don't quite know what to do because everything was going in order until Putin and the British
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:30.840]  Parliament blocked him on Syria. I don't know how they'll get around it, but they certainly
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:40.160]  don't want Iran left there. They don't want Hezbollah there in Lebanon. And so they're
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:45.600]  probably trying to figure out how can we get this going again? I don't know if they can
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:53.960]  risk another false flag operation because there's so much skepticism of them now. Clearly, their
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:44:00.680]  lies don't go down as well or as easily with the rest of the world. But I don't think
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:07.520]  they've given up. So I see this as a temporary defeat for the neoconservatives and for the
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:13.400]  Israel lobby, but they'll find some way or they'll certainly attempt to find some way
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:19.000]  to continue the wars and turmoil in the Middle East.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:26.200]  Now, sir, I want to get specifically into what we're seeing happen here with Putin and
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:32.600]  then back into what you were just discussing with Syria and Iran. But I don't romanticize
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:38.160]  Vladimir Putin, but I do look at his policies trying to get their economy going, trying
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:43.560]  to cut taxes on poor people, trying to pay people to get married and have kids. He put
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:51.600]  out an op-ed in the Interfax News Agency that is being criticized where he said, we need
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:58.760]  family values. We need basic religion like Christianity. We need to not attack families.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:04.000]  And our country's so evil now that our media is criticizing him for saying we don't need
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.200]  to be degenerate. And I'm really wondering, because you have a lot of contacts internationally,
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:13.760]  I know. Who Vladimir Putin really is and how you think they'll respond to an attack on
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:18.600]  Iran? Because, as you know, Lindsey Graham has got a resolution to just give Obama strike
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:24.560]  power. He said, you don't need it, but here I want to give it to you. And Israel is saying,
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:33.080]  no time left for negotiations, says their minister, just really a push to start war.
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:41.080]  And then I'm wondering, well, first the Putin question, and then, I mean, is Israel and
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:51.920]  NATO and Saudi Arabia and Turkey, why they're so reckless? Well, Israel has its own interests
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:46:02.240]  and uses Washington, and then Washington uses its puppets like Turkey and NATO. Look, the
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:12.360]  Russians went through many decades of tyranny in the police state and sort of a very hard
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:19.160]  attitude of government for the people. And they've learned a lesson. They're, they've
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:25.800]  redeemed themselves. And when the Soviet Union collapsed, because of the various chaos and
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:33.440]  the advice they were given by Americans, a lot of outside money managed to grab most
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:39.000]  of the resources. And they were bleeding Russia dry, just like they bleed Americans
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:45.520]  dry. And Putin got in and more or less stopped that and reduced it.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:52.440]  So is he a good dictator? I mean, I know he's been elected three times and he's saying
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.560]  a fourth may run, but then they argue those elections are fixed. But I mean, is he the
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:06.280]  good, strong man then? He's an elected official with massive support. And whatever the Western
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:10.480]  media says is just a lie. What do they tell the truth about nothing? So why would you
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:13.080]  believe what they said about Putin? Sure, sure, sure. I was being devil's advocate.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.480]  I know he's not a dictator. So, so what, what do you, I mean, you've got international
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:21.920]  awards. You travel over the world. What is your intel on Putin then? I mean, is he really
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:28.360]  in control and what is his goal? Because he does try to do a lot of good things for Russians.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:34.400]  Precisely. That's what his job is. And he's trying to put a country back together that
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:44.480]  was destroyed. And he's he's succeeding. His main problem is the hundreds of non governmental
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.920]  organizations inside Russia that pretend to be human rights groups and they're American
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:57.480]  agents. They're funded by Washington and and Washington funds the so-called political opposition
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:05.360]  to Putin. So his main problem is the American interference, Washington interference in internal
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:12.480]  Soviet politics. And his other problem is the radicalization of the Muslims in the Middle
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:18.920]  East by the United States and Israel. And the reason Washington does this is they hope
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:25.040]  to spread the radicalization and the strife into Russia and into China. That's what I
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:30.840]  was about to say. The Russian media reported that Bandar Bush, the Saudi prince nickname
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:37.080]  Bandar Bush, Prince Bandar Sultan threatened to use al-Qaeda against Russia if they don't
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:44.040]  back off. I mean, this is amazing. Yeah. Well, we've already done that to them, you know,
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:49.600]  the Chechens. And we support the Chechens. I don't mean you and I, but I mean, Washington
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:57.640]  that's true. Yeah. And so if you are determined to have world hegemony, remember now, this
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:03.720]  is the driving force of American foreign policy in the 21st century is the neoconservative
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:13.360]  ideology of US world hegemony. You can't invade China or Russia. So you have to destabilize
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:18.400]  them. And so we have a two prong attack. One is we have all of these Washington funded
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:26.760]  NGOs pretending to be human rights organizations. And then we hope to spread more and more Muslim
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:33.920]  strife into the Muslim populations of China and India. And then we use the Washington
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:39.680]  funded NGOs in those countries to denounce the governments for opposing the freedom
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.920]  fighters. And then the government arrest them as foreign agents and our media says they're
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:50.280]  arresting them for protesting. That's exactly right. And so that's the that's the American
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:57.640]  plan. And Putin is, I think, aware of that. And he's beginning to act to it and to stand
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:06.240]  up to it. I think the Chinese have been very careless in their relations with Washington.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:12.160]  Maybe they were more centered on American markets and putting up with other things to
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:20.800]  sure. But they they too will learn. And then what if this policy from the United States
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:25.360]  continues to be aggressive, it'll lead to a nuclear war.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:30.920]  Paul Craig Roberts.org is where people can read your daily and weekly columns. Simply
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:34.920]  amazing. The site looks great as well. Very easy to use. We're going to do one more segment

[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:42.640]  I want to ask you specifically back on the economy, what you think is going to happen
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:49.800]  to it then in a timeframe with QE unlimited. And and and then here if you're saying economists
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:54.760]  are wrong then, because I hope they're wrong, that they see something really bad to happen
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:58.400]  next year. So I want to find out in the final segment with them, then your phone calls and

[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  Use it only in emergency. All right, final segment with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. Paul
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.280]  Craig Roberts and more. That's real Alex Jones on Twitter. Also our Facebook, you can find that
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:35.800]  at prismplanet.com. Links over to that. And then of course there's the nightly news, seven
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:40.840]  o'clock weeknights, a big show tonight, in fall wars, nightly news, seven o'clock central.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:45.480]  Dr. Roberts, I was talking to you during the break, quantifying this. You were telling me
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:51.120]  you agree with Faber, Ron Paul and others that next year looks bad, but that it doesn't matter
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:56.200]  either way with QE. So I know you don't like to put dates on it, but I remember about three,
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:00.680]  four years ago, you were on the show saying, I would guess three or four years till it really
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:05.480]  collapses. It takes longer for these things, but three or four years. That's, that was always
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:11.960]  your answer. And then you said two years. Yeah, go ahead. Go. No, no, go ahead. Tell us
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.120]  what you think is going to happen. Oh, his Skype froze. All right. I'm really, Skype is
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:22.240]  a great technology, but I tell you, it'll drive us crazy when we got a really important question.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:31.520]  So, so he's accurately been predicting a lot of stuff. And I just want to find out if I
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:35.000]  really need to be that worried. And if you need to be that word, because we know the economy
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.480]  slowly rotting and things are deindustrializing. It's terrible and they're shutting down our
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:43.320]  power plants and all the rest of it. But I want to know from Roberts, he said during
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:49.320]  the break, he said, no, I think next year is going to be bad. I want to find out specifically
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:53.000]  what he has to say. Okay, it's connecting right now. And we'll get him to answer that
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:56:00.760]  question. He'd like elevator music, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:05.320]  da, da, da, da. Soon as we get him, we'll tell you what's going on with that. But I've
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:10.080]  just never heard Ron Paul and Mark Fauber and Jim Rogers and all these really smart
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:16.120]  guys that have been proven to be very accurate, getting more and more on the same page about
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:24.880]  what's happening and about what's going on. Yeah, we're lucky we've even got power here
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:27.320]  with the thunderstorms we've got going on in Austin. I don't even know if you can hear
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:36.440]  that lightning and thunder. I guess you don't hear lightning, you see lightning. Or feel
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:40.840]  it, feel the lightning if you get struck by it. I guess you see and feel lightning, you
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:49.000]  listen to thunder. Well, it looks like his sky's down. It is not connecting to him. Oh,
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.440]  he's having power outages too. What does he have storms there too? Well, we'll have to
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:57:00.760]  find out next week. But, but, but what he said during the break was he said no. He said
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:05.240]  it's bad next year. And he said we're getting to that point. I'm sure he'll write an article
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:09.600]  about that. We can email him and ask him to write us an article about that specifically
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:15.880]  on that subject because there's a lot of speculation. What a cliffhanger that we just had. He goes,
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:24.880]  Alex, you're gone. So we're no longer in contact with him. Okay, folks, speaking of
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:31.120]  Vladimir Putin, everybody's got their Vladimir Putin plush doll they sleep with at night
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:35.920]  or your little snuggle dog. If you're a dog or whatever, you can have like little cutesy
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:42.240]  bobbleheads of Vladimir Putin. Girls can get him tattooed on their on their posteriors
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:48.800]  or whatever. He's our new savior. Russia has gone through such hellish corruption for 80
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:56.760]  years, 90 years that the only thing that stays the same is change. And again, I don't romanticize
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:01.400]  or glorify Vladimir Putin. But when he writes op-eds about how we need Christianity and
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:07.560]  how we need God and how we need family and how we need to have children and how the West
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:15.400]  is dying. I mean, this is just absolute truth. It's up on info wars.com and their fact story.
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:22.080]  So compared to what we have running things here, that's why people are like jumping on
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:26.480]  Vladimir Putin like he's a piece of driftwood in the ocean when your ship is sunk. I think
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:31.800]  that's it. He's not a perfect vessel by any means. And there are a lot of corrupt forces
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:36.480]  in Russia that would use any leverage they can get for their own advantage. But I think
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:59:02.480]  we should try to be friends with the Russians. We'll be right back.
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:28.480]  See you in the next video.

[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:12.480]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:21.480]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:27.920]  All right, let's go back to Kevin in New York. Kevin, I had to put him on hold earlier. He
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:33.880]  went to the hospital. They pressured him and gave the baby the hepatitis shot. What really
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:38.200]  hurts them is then getting the second round, third round. If they think you're ignorant
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:41.280]  of the facts, they'll lie to you and say it's the law. This is all part of the criminal
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:46.080]  operation. It's not that vaccines couldn't be good. There's some evidence that the technology
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:53.080]  is there and works. It's been around for 500 years. It's that these companies are eugenicist-based
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:57.240]  and we know there's covert programs. They've been caught over and over again involved in
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:06.880]  through vaccines. So none of my three children have ever had a needle in them. And they are
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:11.920]  bigger and smarter and happier than almost all the children there around, unless they're
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.760]  other children that are eating organic food and not taking all this stuff. Because I mess
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:20.360]  up and eat crap sometimes. Didn't for a long time. For a long time I didn't think I'd be
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:24.920]  around very long. So I just thought I'd eat chicken fried steaks and drink beer if I wanted
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:32.840]  to. I've been a lot healthier the last five, six years. But the point is that my children
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:40.120]  have done great. So there's my bottom line on vaccines. I'm not going to tell you to
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:44.240]  do stuff with your family. Actually print it. That's why I wanted to get Mike Adams
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:50.920]  on last week. Ken admitted but shocking facts about vaccines. I want to cover that when
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:55.440]  he comes in in the next segment. But does that answer your question, Kevin?
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:00.920]  Yeah. I was just really skeptical about what they're giving my kid. And I heard they put
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:06.360]  mercury in the shots. I didn't know if that was true or not. And I just wanted to see
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:14.040]  your perspective on it basically. I mean, are you asking if there's mercury in the
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:25.200]  hep B shot? There's mercury in all of them and 98% of the time they have mercury in them.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:29.920]  They did a hoax in the last seven, eight years where they said there's no longer mercury
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:34.880]  in the shots. First they said it wasn't in there. Then they said, okay, now it's not
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:44.480]  in there. But the government's regulatory said we would like you to make available non-mercury
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:51.120]  based the Marisol vaccines. And so yes, if you know where to look and work hard, you
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:56.480]  can find it without mercury. They also have cleaner vaccines that it turns out world leaders
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:01.880]  take. This has come out in China, in Germany, and in England. The Royal Family takes specially
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:06.520]  developed vaccines that have been checked with electron microscopes and everything. They
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:10.880]  don't take what the public takes. See, that's a whole nother reason here. I mean, I'm not
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:15.320]  just saying this, folks, you can look that up if you're a new listener. You just want
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:21.040]  to find is German government takes clean vaccines and it'll pull up like BBC. So, but listen,
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:24.960]  your daughter's probably going to be okay just getting the hep B, even though it's
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:31.240]  one of the worst. It's the piling on that really starts to get to them. So is your
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:39.760]  wife breastfeeding her? Breastfeeding. The baby's healthy and everything. Did you say
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:45.080]  you were breastfeeding? Yeah, my wife's breastfeeding, yeah. Okay, okay. Well, that's because your
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:52.040]  wife's designed to produce the proper fat and but also colostrum vaccine, natural vaccine.
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:04:00.240]  Every immunity that women in your entire female line had is is is every immunity is transmitted
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:06.680]  into the baby. Okay, so breastfeeding is absolutely king. The brain mass will be much bigger.
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:12.520]  Higher IQ, breastfeed that child as long as you can. Don't ever give her, you know, GMO
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:17.640]  garbage. And your daughter's going to turn out all right in my humble opinion, but you
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:21.480]  definitely need to make sure she's getting purified water. Don't give them the nursery
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:24.960]  water that has the chemical weapons in it. This is all meant to target your daughter
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:33.480]  to make sure she's a zombie. Thank you very much, Alex. I appreciate it. Thank you, sir.
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:37.640]  God bless you. Just listen, there is no law. They'll lie to you and say there is no side
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:42.840]  effects. They are dirty, rotten liars. Now I wanted to get him in here a week ago, but
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:48.400]  he was busy. Please hear now. Mike Adams, I wanted to get him in here to talk about
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:55.720]  10 incredibly shocking facts about vaccines that are admitted, but nobody knows. We'll
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:01.240]  talk about that. But first SSRIs because of the shootings.
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:06.800]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life threatening pathogens.
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:11.880]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged. You can even make your own colloidal
[02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:16.280]  silver at home in your garage. How do you know which solution is the safest and most
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:22.520]  effective? Supernatural silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:28.480]  of AC current. This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory. Colloidal
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:34.560]  and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:40.960]  hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria and fungus. Supernatural silver liquid
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:46.380]  can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically. To find out more information

[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:11.040]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes,
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:17.880]  autism and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:23.560]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled

[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:24.840]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:32.120]  We are now into hour number three. We will be back this Sunday live at 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:37.080]  Standard Time. We have some big special reports and other things that David Knight is going
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:42.320]  to be premiering and airing here coming up this Sunday. I will be calling in on the show
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:48.160]  with a report but I am going to be here in Austin at a wedding. So I will not be here
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:54.200]  Sunday going to my friend's wedding but again I will be back on Monday Lord willing. Let
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:58.520]  me give you a few of the headlines at infowars.com that are breaking and that I have not gotten
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:04.400]  to as well. Governments hire web trolls to sway public opinion and that is an important
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:10.080]  video report Watson did on all the new admissions not just here but all over the world but the
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:15.160]  headlines probably be governments accelerate hiring armies of trolls because this has been
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:21.040]  going on for a long time. Now it is going great guns. We can even watch the IP addresses
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.960]  coming in and what they are doing on the site from the Department of Defense from PR firms
[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:30.960]  you know in there just they will say racist stuff and fight with each other and I mean
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:37.320]  just anything to divert people that are in there on infowars.com. So it is kind of interesting
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:42.200]  to watch government in action there on the site. Less than half of Americans want stricter
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:46.640]  gun laws that is even in a white wash pole. It is more like 70% don't want it but Obama
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:51.400]  says 80 to 90%. He also says polar bears can't swim and raising the debt limit did not raise
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:56.400]  the debt. I can't get any more Orwellian than that. Do I need to even describe what a lie
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:01.600]  that is to people. Then we have got Ron Paul with Charlie Rose the meaning of non-interventionism
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:06.500]  great video. You are much more likely to be killed by lightning than by a terrorist Washington
[02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:11.000]  blog story. I know you know that folks but get that out to friends and family. Top climate
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.360]  scientists told to cover up the fact that earth temperature hasn't risen for 15 years
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:20.920]  and the German government has been caught begging people to cover this up. I have the
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:26.400]  decline continuing journalism professor hopes for death of NRA members children at their
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:31.360]  Navy Yard shooting and Russia will defend national identity based on religious values
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:37.320]  an op-ed of the world praising Christianity by Vladimir Putin. He is even against abortion.
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:44.120]  I guess the pope won't do it so we will make Vladimir Putin the pope. This is getting crazy
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:48.360]  ladies and gentlemen. I don't know what Vladimir Putin is up to. This is something I had to
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:52.960]  get to today because it is so weird. This ought to be on the nightly news. I am going
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:59.880]  to shoot something on the nightly news about this. Alien bugs discovered in earth's atmosphere
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:05.560]  and this did not come to us from the planet Pop-Tart website. This came to us from Sky
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:12.920]  News or the Fox News of the UK. British scientists believe they found small bugs from outer space
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:22.440]  in earth's atmosphere. They felt like in mine shafts and stuff too. Tiny organisms were
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:29.920]  discovered by the University of Sheffield experts on a research balloon. They sent 27 kilometers
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:34.560]  into the atmosphere. I remember when the guy jumped from several miles or whatever the
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:41.960]  highest jump in a space suit from a balloon. It is so amazing. The microscopic bugs were
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:46.520]  detected when the balloon landed back on the ground in Wakefield, West Yorkshire but the
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:50.280]  scientists insist the samples could not have been carried from earth's surface into the
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:57.360]  stratosphere. The second layer of the atmosphere stretches 50 kilometers or 31 miles from
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:01.560]  the ground up into the atmosphere and folks this has never been found before or whatever
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:05.960]  these things are. So this is a big deal. We can punch it up on screen. Yeah, there you
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:14.240]  go. Really, really amazing science fiction stuff. Look at this little creature. The fragment
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:20.760]  of an organism was also found, scientists say. Just amazing. We are certainly in the
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:26.080]  middle of an amazing creation. But the system wants to shackle us and kind of keep us in
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:31.000]  their own little artificial paradigm. Their full spectrum dominance, their silent weapons
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:38.480]  for quiet wars, soft kill system and fighting that valiantly is the health ranger joining
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:44.360]  us here in studio Mike Adams of naturalnews.com because I wanted to get him on last week.
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:49.240]  So he's here for that at the bottom of the hour. This story from naturalnews.com, ten
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.080]  outrageous and I'm going to tweet it in a minute at real elections, ten outrageous but
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:59.120]  true facts about vaccines. The CDC and the vaccine vaccine industry don't want you to
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:04.040]  know about this is so useful because just like I get callers that are asking me vaccines
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:08.520]  are bad. There are a lot of people don't know what's going on. Just because you know that
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:12.880]  the inserts say it can kill you. Just because you know it's causing an epidemic of neurological
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:17.560]  disorders, you know, mainline Harvard studies. Just because you're informed, your neighbors
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:24.120]  aren't informed. You need to inform them right now with tools like this. I'm going to tweet
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:29.520]  it while Mike's talking and I want you to retweet it from real Alex Jones in just a
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:35.120]  moment when I do this. But Mike, before we get into that, the shooting at the Navy Yard,
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:41.000]  the gangland shooting in Chicago, all these are done in gun free zones. As usual, psychotropic
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.840]  drugs are involved. Break down from all your research exactly what we're facing.
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:51.160]  Well, Alex, thanks for having me back on the show buddy. It's honored to be here again.
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:54.840]  I've been kind of out of the loop for a little while working in the lab. You know, I'm doing
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:58.160]  this forensic food lab. There's a lot of news coming out later this year. Very exciting
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:04.520]  with you. I brought this table of elements in here today to show you obviously your radio
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:09.080]  listeners can't see it, but we'll describe what we're seeing. This helps to explain why
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:16.280]  psychiatric drugs are so toxic to the human brain. Brain chemistry is directly interfered
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:23.240]  with by SSRIs. That's what SSR stands for is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:28.360]  And serotonin obviously is one of the very important brain chemicals that gives you normal
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:34.240]  balance. And that's why in almost every case these shooters are saying, I felt like I was
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:38.800]  in a video game and this shooter in the Navy Yard, he was a video game addict, right?
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:44.920]  And they say I felt a sense of detachment and the Columbine shootings in Colorado, those
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:48.840]  two shooters had the same kind of description. They feel like they're in a video game. They're
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:54.880]  not in their own real mind. This element, fluorine on the table of elements that I brought
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:15:03.040]  here, it helps explain why this is the case. Fluorine is in the seventh column of the table
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:06.760]  of elements if you break it down to just the eight column model without the transition
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:12.360]  metals here. Why that's important, and I'm not going to get too technical, but from
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:18.560]  a chemistry perspective, fluorine has seven electron clouds in its outer orbital. So
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:24.360]  it's lacking one electron. It wants to steal electrons from other elements. So if it gets
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:28.560]  near anything else, including chemicals in your brain, normal healthy brain chemicals
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:35.240]  like serotonin, if it is unbound from the molecule that it's attached to in the pharmaceutical,
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:39.920]  such as the psychiatric drugs, it will start to ravage other chemicals in your brain and
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:46.640]  in your body. This is why fluoride kills insects and it's such an effective insecticide. This
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:54.080]  is why fluoride causes bone cancer when it's added to water as fluosilic acid. Fluorine
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:16:00.880]  is represented in psychiatric drugs at the level of about 14% according to atomic mass.
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:06.960]  So if you break out all the elements and weigh them, fluorine is about 14%. And yet it is
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:13.800]  one of the most wide-ranging reactive industrial chemicals in human civilization.
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:17.640]  And they've known this for hundreds of years. That's what Dr. Blalock talks about. It also
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:24.880]  supercharges everything else they're putting in us. It's the master chemical weapon supercharger.
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:33.120]  Exactly. And your term supercharging segues us into vaccines because the CDC openly admits
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:38.480]  that at least five chemicals or elements are still being used in vaccines. And today we're
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:44.320]  going to talk about the aluminum that's still used in them, mercury is still used in them,
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:49.120]  MSG, yes, monosodium glutamate, a neurotoxin that you've had Dr. Blalock.
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:54.800]  Because it's an excitotoxin. It's an excitotoxin. It is used in vaccines to quote supercharge
[02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:58.800]  the vaccine as an adjuvant. Now let's stop one place because I mean you talk a lot about
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:02.640]  iodine and every medical doctor I talk to, more and more are saying this is the key to
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:08.520]  everything. Notice in the same area of the table here you've got iodine that your body
[02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:13.840]  needs so they take that out of the food, out of the salt what you actually need to replace
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:19.440]  it with something that goes into the thyroid instead. I mean they know exactly what they're
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:24.680]  doing and when they try to make babies drink fluoride they are literally trying to savage
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:29.100]  their brain. You're very observant. You're exactly right on. If you move down a column
[02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:33.840]  of the table of elements and this is considered the seventh orbital column, you have fluoride,
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:40.040]  chlorine, bromine and iodine. These tend to interfere with each other or compete for
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:44.480]  absorption or attachment throughout human physiology. So when you're drinking fluoride
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:48.240]  your body's not able to get the iodine that it needs in the right places such as breast
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:52.880]  tissue, prostate tissue. This is one of the reasons why so many women have breast cancer
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:58.640]  today because fluoride or even chlorine that they're getting from tap water, both of those
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:04.280]  are in tap water, are interfering with iodine absorption. So if you move down a column of
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:08.000]  the table of elements you can actually discern a lot of interesting information.
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:12.160]  I finally started listening to everybody about six months ago and started making myself take
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:18.800]  the nascent iodine and the southern hemisphere brown seaweed and it is like a drug. I'm even
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:20.120]  more crazed now.
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:21.120]  Oh no.
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:22.120]  Oh no.
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:24.120]  What's that world?
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:28.240]  Well you need to get, I think, I would recommend Dr. Brownstein, David Brownstein.
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:30.760]  We're getting him on next week. It's funny you said that.
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:36.720]  Good. He is the best expert that I know of iodine and he has studied it extensively and
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:41.680]  he recommends that the level of iodine people should take is literally, if memory serves
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:47.680]  me correctly, 100 times to a thousand times higher than what the government recommends,
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:51.560]  which is not surprising because the government wants everybody nutritionally depleted. But
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:56.920]  iodine, nascent iodine in my opinion, I don't, you know, I don't manufacture the product.
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:18:58.520]  This is a third-party opinion.
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:03.920]  Nascent iodine is one of the most miraculous life-saving supplements that our society needs,
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:07.840]  especially landlocked Americans because we're not getting the seafood.
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:10.160]  Well that's why the Japanese live so much longer.
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:14.640]  They tend to have much lower rates of breast cancer until they move to America and there
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:18.680]  have been really good clinical studies on this. Once they move to America and start eating
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:23.760]  the American diet, they get the same rates of breast cancer as American women. So what's
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:28.720]  changed? They're foods. They're diets. But at the same time, you got to be really careful
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:32.400]  about the sources of seaweed you're getting. Make sure you're getting good quality sources.
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:37.080]  So a standalone iodine supplement is ideal to give you the iodine just when you need
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:38.080]  it.
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:39.680]  Now you recommended the Modify Loan We Sell. That's good, right?
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:40.680]  That's good, yes.
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:45.240]  That's from Southern Hemisphere and you've tested it because that's what my wife really
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:49.040]  loves. She says this, I guess the other co-factors in the seaweed are helping.
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:52.760]  Yeah, there's a lot in that seaweed. It's a brown seaweed extract.
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:58.240]  Yeah. All right, we'll be right back to get into the vaccines with Mike Adams. Stay with
[02:19:58.240 --> 02:19:59.240]  us.
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:06.200]  Hi there. My name is Frank Bates. What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could
[02:20:06.200 --> 02:20:12.880]  get me in a lot of trouble. I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com
[02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:17.240]  that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:21.800]  Incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:27.320]  bills criminally high. Some have called this a conspiracy. Others have called it a cover-up
[02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:34.240]  and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes. My video at 123coverup.com
[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:38.760]  exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:39.760]  too.
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:43.720]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:39.920]  monitoring your every move. Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:45.200]  nature of this government is on display undeniably every day. What's taking place right now is
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:49.640]  a coup and the destruction of the Constitution. Fortunately, there is something you can do

[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:19.760]  Mike, this is a short segment, long segment coming up to get to a ton of news. Stuff
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:23.560]  you've broken on the TED conference. You've got a video here we're going to play a clip
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:28.320]  of that's up on naturalnews.com. We're just posted at infowars.com with your organic
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:35.320]  spy series inside Whole Foods. But you were just mentioning, man, we're starting to win
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:41.800]  on so many fronts. I'm seeing a giant awakening. 91% against the cereal war. The mainstream
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:47.520]  media dying, the alternative media becoming the dominant media. But this is a big responsibility
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:51.200]  though. So I mean, talk about the awakening. You were just talking about it.
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:57.960]  Well, I was saying to you during the break, we're winning on so many levels. It is astonishing.
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:03.920]  Right now on the scientific front, we are getting the real scientific principles out
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:08.480]  there that are going to save humanity. The precautionary principle when we talk about
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:13.440]  GMOs, for example, we are exposing the fact that mercury, one of the most toxic elements
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:18.680]  in the table of elements, is still injected into babies and children intentionally by
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:22.920]  doctors and that should be a crime against humanity. Every doctor that injects a child
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:26.680]  with mercury should have their license revoked and they should be arrested and charged with
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:32.520]  a crime. In my opinion, obviously, and probably in yours as well, we are winning on so many
[02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:37.840]  fronts. We wait until October 1 comes around, Alex, because the Obamacare exchanges are
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:43.520]  a disaster, a disaster waiting to happen. I think today Congress actually voted to defund
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:49.440]  Obamacare, which is a partial victory in the House. It may not survive the Senate, of course.
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:55.280]  But once it's rolled out and people realize that that IT system doesn't work, there's
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:26:01.840]  going to be even more calls for Obamacare to be defunded or radically reformed or even
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:07.320]  revoked. People all across the country are losing their jobs, losing hours, losing their
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:12.080]  jobs. They're having full-time jobs, switched to part-time jobs. They're being kicked off
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:16.360]  healthcare plans from companies like Trader Joe's, a SeaWorld even did the same thing.
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:22.320]  It's happening all across the country. The fact is that the truth is coming out and it's
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:27.360]  due to organizations like yours, InfoWars, and I'm contributing to it, many others.
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:32.600]  You have some new people here who are contributing to it in very substantial ways. We are winning
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:38.520]  because the truth cannot be hidden forever. We're winning because the people desire the
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:42.200]  knowledge that can transform them and give them the kind of freedom that America was
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:43.440]  founded on.
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:47.960]  So all of these corporations that are committing these terrible evils, that are harming our
[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:53.120]  children with vaccines, that are poisoning our population with drugs, all of these tyrants
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:58.840]  like in my opinion, Feinstein, who is an anti-constitutional traitor to the United States, traitor to the
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:05.400]  people, all of these people are being exposed. The truth is coming out and it cannot be stopped.
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:10.360]  Even if they manage to stop you or me personally, there are many other people who are ready
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:16.040]  to continue to carry that torch forward, tell the truth, have websites, conduct activism.
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:20.800]  This whole movement, Alex, is decentralized. So there's not even really one place that
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:25.520]  they can go and stop the truth from coming out. The Internet is by nature decentralized.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:30.000]  And that's always been my goal, is to get as many people awake and active. That's why
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.720]  I've never been in competition with all the other media people and alternative media.
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:39.720]  So many of them think it's about shutting down their competition, not understanding
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:44.520]  it's about empowering and getting more people involved. This is a life and death situation.
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:49.520]  That's what's been so great about your work, Mike, is working with everybody together positively
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:54.560]  to really try to give the globalists to run for their money. And we're doing it now and
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:57.960]  look at Cass Sunstein at the Winehouse. He said their number one goal is to get us to
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:02.200]  end fight. That's why they're launching the armies of trolls right now. But it's not working.
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:03.200]  It's not working.
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:08.640]  It's not working. But we also have very strong evidence, lots of evidence. The trolls specifically
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:12.920]  target us. They spread disinformation. You know this is old news. But what we're seeing
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:19.600]  now are more advanced linguistic patterns. So we now believe that these systems that,
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:26.280]  for example, drug companies hire anti PR firms that run thousands of bots that are initiated
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:29.880]  through zombie controlled computers using a multitude of IP addresses all across the
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:30.880]  sky.
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:32.640]  You're a top programmer. I mean, this is all admitted though.
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:33.640]  I'm a software developer.
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:35.040]  This is all admitted though, too.
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:41.720]  No, I develop word algorithms as part of the science natural news whole system. I wrote
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:46.960]  those algorithms. So I understand parsing language. So what we're seeing is that there's
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:51.520]  new language appearing by the trolls that appears to be automatically generated. It's
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:55.640]  algorithmically generated. So for those out there listening right now, if you see negative
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:29:00.600]  comments about Alex Jones or about Mike Adams or the health ranger, you should in your mind
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:05.600]  a red flag should go up where you say at least 50% of those negative comments are not real
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:06.600]  people.
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:10.280]  They're algorithms and then it creates a snowball effect where weaker people then regurgitate
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:11.280]  it.
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:17.560]  Because there's all these psychological forces in place, the sheeple mentality, the herd
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:22.080]  mentality, and it's very real. People want to follow the crowd. So what they do is they
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:27.640]  use these algorithms to try to create a fake crowd that then susceptible people with weak
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:28.640]  minds.
[02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:31.720]  It's internet. It's internet astroturf. Stay there. We're going to come back and get into
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:36.400]  the 10 outrageous but true facts about vaccines, the CDC and the vaccine industry doesn't want
[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:37.400]  you to know about.
[02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:42.360]  I just shot out the link at real Alex Jones on Twitter. Mike Adams, our guest, and your
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:50.320]  phone calls are coming up. Stay with us.

[02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:29.920]  We're going to get into those with Mike and then into vaccines here in just a moment as
[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:35.200]  a real public service emergency announcement of facts. But look at this article in a Wired
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:40.760]  Magazine since Mike mentioned that. They've had bots for about five years. I know of writing
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:45.760]  fake news. Okay, that way you put out talking points, but to make it look like there's diversity,
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:51.720]  a computer then basically scrambles it, but you can't tell the computer wrote it in in
[02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:55.680]  most cases. We've then talked to people in the industry that write and they say they've
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:34:00.120]  been replaced. They like these link farm folks that just write these, you know, these jumbled
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:08.040]  articles on top web searches. Well, now computers are replacing that, but the CIA invest in
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:13.960]  narrative science and its automated writers. Again, to just create gnome de plumes, fake
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:18.840]  people, because humans might have a conscience and want to tell you the truth. So now they
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:24.360]  actually have articles coming out where basically people are told by an editor, a talking point,
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:28.480]  here's what you write about and then a human reconstructs it, but still some truth might
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:34.960]  get out. And so they want it to be done by robots. So that's the future we face is why
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:41.200]  they want the military to go to drones and combat robots and things because they won't
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:45.680]  refuse the illegal criminal order. This is what the technocracies about. Now you were
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:49.040]  just telling me about and we're pulling it up to show viewers. I remember seeing this
[02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:52.360]  yesterday as well and meant to get to it, kind of like they just discovered new life
[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:58.320]  forms 37 miles up in the atmosphere. It's just stuff's getting crazy, crazy. I mean,
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:03.720]  it's just going to speed up towards the singularity. Break down what you just got into dealing
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:09.280]  with DNA. Well, I didn't bring all the documents on this, but this is so huge and this has
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:15.160]  huge implications for forensic in police work. Many people who've been accused of crimes
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:19.560]  may be innocent because of what I'm about to tell you. Throughout the history of science
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:23.520]  and genetics, it has been assumed that your genetic code is identical across all of your
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:27.520]  cells. So if they take a sample of your hair or a sample of your skin or a sample of your
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:33.000]  saliva or even a sample of your liver for that matter, that your cells are going to
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:40.280]  have the same exact genetic code. It turns out this is false, that you have genomic divergence
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:45.960]  across your physiology, across your phenotype. In other words, your expression of genes is
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:49.560]  different because your genes are actually different in your own body. So yeah, you might
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:55.040]  have small hands and big feet. And they may be because of different genes on one side
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:59.480]  versus the other. This happens very early in fetal fetus development that you can have
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:05.080]  genetic divergence basically at a very early stage. And then that gets multiplied and multiplied.
[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:11.720]  So your heart organ may have a different genotype, different genetic code than your hand. And
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:15.560]  this has just been scientifically proven. It is shocking. Most scientists hearing this
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:21.680]  will say, I'm making it up. It can't be true. This is completely false. But no, science
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:25.960]  has to be rewritten. And this is the message here, Alex, that so much of what's coming
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:32.840]  out today means that science has to be rewritten. We have to move forward and understand new
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:37.000]  ideas and not get stuck in the old ideas. I just did an article about the TED conferences
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:42.280]  and TEDx, where they had posted a story that said anybody talking about GMOs has to be
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:48.400]  red flagged. And they banned a talk by Dr. Rupert Sheldrake on consciousness. And they
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:53.880]  banned a talk by Graham Hancock. Oh yeah, I mean, they're total new world order. Absolutely,
[02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:58.360]  absolutely. But they said that if you talk about foods as medicine, then you are a quote
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:03.120]  health hoaxer. So they're stuck in this flat earth line as Pauling won the Nobel Prize
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:07.920]  for that. Of course. Yeah, orange fields. Vitamin C is very, very therapeutic. I want
[02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:10.640]  you to get back into that because you mentioned this genetic thing. I want to go back before
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:16.160]  I forget to get into this carried off. They said no, no, no, they said that 96% of the
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:21.080]  DNA was junk. Now they've gone in. That's all these top geneticists that have these
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:25.040]  super high power electron microscopes are becoming religious now and saying somebody
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:30.120]  made this, right? Because there's like all these other genomes of other animals in there.
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:34.240]  And there's all these other people in there. And it's got like little antennas to receive
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:40.680]  in. I mean, it is the people like one, whoa, whoa, it's all being used. It's all going
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:47.120]  on. And it's amazing. The human genetic code. It's interesting. Scientists, they say they
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:51.880]  think they understand the cosmos, but they don't understand the 96%, which is dark matter
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:55.480]  and dark energy. They have no clue about that. All of this, this table of elements that I
[02:37:55.480 --> 02:38:00.560]  have here of which all matter in our world and our cosmos is made of, according to the
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:06.280]  scientists, this is only 4% Alex of the material universe. The other 96% is unknown just like
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:11.780]  in our devices, not just our senses. We can't even detect it. Right. And we've only just
[02:38:11.780 --> 02:38:15.880]  invented devices that can detect it. And you have scientists that are out there saying,
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:20.520]  well, the universe, there was this big bang followed by inflation and it became a whole
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:26.520]  universe of cosmos from nothing without cause. Therefore, there's no God. Huh? What? Wait
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:32.040]  a minute. Who started the big bang? Who seeded the cosmos? And then you've got whole issues
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:36.640]  about the multiverse, right? That we are one universe of many multiverses, all with the
[02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:41.680]  creator and engineer, you can say from a technical perspective, who created this. There has to
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:47.160]  be a cause to create an entire universe. It doesn't happen from nothing. It's obvious.
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:52.680]  Well, exactly. It's like staying in the middle of a Sahara desert, a fine Swiss wristwatch
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:56.440]  would over time would be blown together. Everyone knows that's impossible. And then
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:02.080]  a cell is literally billions of times more complex. And then we've got all these different
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:08.280]  cell groups almost like a jellyfish is really a composite organism, a colony. We're really
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:14.880]  a colony. But then we're energized by an energy force that the science is now showing
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:20.040]  in all the studies. That's what you'd call a spirit. Right. Exactly. A space time continuum,
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:25.480]  presence, consciousness, and so on. Also realizing the history of science, they said up until
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:30.400]  I don't know the exact date, but until the era of microbiology, they said, there is no
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:35.360]  such thing as bacteria disease can't be spread by bacteria. And those scientists were crazy
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:40.200]  who said so. Exactly. But today we have more cells in our bodies, Alex, that are bacteria
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:45.480]  than human cells. We are a hybrid organism. And in fact, there's new science being done
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:50.800]  right now on the genetic expression of the bacteria in your gut being more important
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:54.240]  for your health. And of course, Bill Gates already knew that and they've been targeting
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:40:00.680]  us with the GMO all along and the antibiotics hacking the brain through the stomach and genetically
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:05.480]  hacking your, your intestinal flora through GMOs, which are believed to be transgenic.
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:10.800]  Well, it's now been admitted. It came out this year. It's now leaking into the DNA.
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:15.160]  Right. Altering the DNA of your gut bacteria. There was a story that just came out today.
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:20.760]  A man had his gut infected with a yeast infection and he was brewing beer in his own gut and
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:25.720]  getting drunk without drinking. It because. And that's what's happening with the autistic
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:30.200]  kids in many of the spectrums is that they are actually have toxic garbage growing up.
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:34.760]  Yes. Yes. And it's all made worse by this, this corporate driven or corporate hijacked
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:39.040]  quote science, which is not real science. It's just a way to exploit the human body
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:44.560]  like in the matrix for control and for profit and to doom humanity. That's what's the big
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:45.560]  picture here.
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:49.720]  If we're going to save humanity, we have to move forward. We have to get past this hijacking
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:54.840]  of like you're on fire. Sorry. I know you're always on fire. But would you go up on top
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:41:00.160]  the mountain or something? No, I just had a normal day and normal chocolate avocado smoothie
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:04.080]  like I always have. And I'm just, I'm, I'm passionate about this. You're cheating with
[02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:08.800]  power, Lord Vader. Humanity is in danger, Alex. You know, this is well as anybody.
[02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:12.080]  We have to get past this, but let me get back to the vaccines because I know. You can feel
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:17.800]  the awakening. Can you? Absolutely. We are right now, we are, we as a society are poisoning
[02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:22.080]  our children with what's in vaccine. We're going to cover the vaccines. But look, Chris
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:26.360]  Jordan's wife brought this up there. Rockhounds. It looks just like it does in your periodic
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:32.120]  table here of elements. Yep. There is the loving flooring, the little cube Borg. That's
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:35.760]  what it is. Microscopic cubes that, that the globalists are injecting into us. This is
[02:41:35.760 --> 02:41:39.480]  a calcium fluoride rock. And the only reason it's safe and the only reason we're not dead
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:44.240]  right now being in the room with this element is because you notice I said before that it
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:48.800]  is bound to the calcium, which is over here on the other side. Calcium has two has two
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:54.400]  electron clouds in its outer orbital shell. It binds with the fluoride calcium things
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:57.440]  on that side of the table, bind with things on this side of the table. Essentially that
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:01.600]  that's, it's a general choice. So it is good to take calcium to bind up that. Well, it
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:05.440]  can, but it's better to take iodine to compete with it. So the nascent iodine is really the
[02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:10.360]  best way, but you should avoid fluoride period. Avoidance is a lot of the strategy here of
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:13.440]  everything we talk about, but also notice right here in the middle of the table, you
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:19.400]  have zinc, cadmium and mercury. Mercury, these are all in the same row of column. Mercury
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:24.520]  is highly toxic, highly neurotoxic. Cadmium is a highly toxic element, a heavy metal that's
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:28.280]  now being found in many foods, including some of the tests we're doing are showing it in
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:33.400]  brown rice, including organic brown rice is having a variety of levels of cadmium, but
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:39.220]  zinc is a nutritive element. So sometimes in these tables, you see something you need
[02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:44.640]  like zinc on top of something you don't need like cadmium. So if you take more zinc, guess
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:49.240]  what? You're blocking, you're helping to block the absorption of cadmium and absorb.
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:53.240]  So it's not just important to take this stuff because you need it. You need to block the
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:54.240]  other stuff.
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:58.880]  So defensive eating, this is something that I'm really hot on right now, defensive eating.
[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:03.440]  If you go out and you eat shrimp in a restaurant, most shrimp will have some level of mercury
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:08.560]  in it, but you can eat, you can take activated charcoal capsules that will absorb the mercury
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:12.520]  from the shrimp. So you can actually go out and you can have a meal that you enjoy. I
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:17.800]  enjoy eating seafood too, you know? But I take chlorella and I take activated charcoal and
[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:22.560]  I know that I'm not absorbing the mercury in the shrimp. It's defensive eating just
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:24.280]  like defensive driving.
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:25.280]  It works.
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:26.280]  Sounds pretty extremist.
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:27.280]  I know, I know.
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:31.840]  To be informed and involved, that sounds extreme.
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:32.840]  Pretty crazy.
[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:38.440]  I bet you even know how to read. I bet you think women should breastfeed.
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:43.000]  It's one of my tenets of nutrition, yes.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  That's Al-Qaeda.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  Seriously.
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:46.320]  Oh no, Al-Qaeda's the good guys now.
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:52.000]  So I can't say, hey, what do you make of the whole war in ploding and everything?
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  For now.
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:57.520]  Well, I haven't covered it that much because I've been focused on these areas. But I'll
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:02.360]  say, in my opinion, when Obama said that raising the debt ceiling doesn't increase the debt,
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:08.040]  that right there, that was the final quote of the final chapter of the American Empire
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:09.960]  going down in flames financially.
[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:13.360]  I think they are the ones going crazy, believe me, Maro.
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:17.280]  And we're looking at the reason. Again, let's go back to the table of elements. We have
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:22.080]  lead here. We have cadmium. We have mercury. We have aluminum, which at very high levels
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:26.680]  can also alter brain physiology. This is the reason. One of my main theories right now
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:28.960]  of what's causing the insanity in our world.
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:29.960]  No, it's like the Romans.
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:30.960]  The Romans.
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:31.960]  The Romans, yes.
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:35.400]  The Romans, of course, lined their clay pots with lead.
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:36.400]  And the aqueducts.
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:40.480]  And that was towards the middle and the end. Their decline began when that happened.
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:41.480]  Absolutely.
[02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:43.880]  They were stark, raving mad, and lead makes you violent.
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:48.520]  That makes you crazy. It makes you violent. Cadmium destroys kidney function. It gives
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:53.400]  you heart disease. You look at all of these. Mercury makes you crazy. Mercury gives you
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:54.400]  a lobotomy.
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:57.120]  But CBS said it proves their brain, children.
[02:44:57.120 --> 02:45:00.140]  And they're victims of mercury, too. See, that's the other thing. And you've said this
[02:45:00.140 --> 02:45:05.200]  before, the reframing of all of this. The people that we are trying to save in the matrix
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:07.520]  are also victims of the matrix.
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:12.320]  So we have to be careful, too. And I realize this, too. Sometimes I might go too far and
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:17.880]  attack victims of the system. Sometimes I call people morons if they're scientists who
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:20.080]  don't get all this.
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:23.280]  And sometimes I have to step back from that and realize they're victims, too. They've
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:24.280]  been brain damaged.
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:27.640]  Well, remember before you were awake? You didn't have any of the pieces, so none of
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:30.920]  it made sense. Once you start getting a few pieces, then it accelerates.
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:31.920]  Yeah.
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:33.840]  But we were once as dumb as dirt.
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:39.080]  Absolutely. I was raised on a standard American diet. I took antibiotics. I ate all these
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:43.480]  heavy metals at one time. And by the way, this takes a very concerted effort to get
[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:45.000]  these out of your system.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:49.920]  Cadmium has a 27-year half-life in the body. Lead stays in your bones. You've got a lot
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:55.920]  of elderly women who are now recycling bone mass or losing bone mass. Their bone mass
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:45:57.520]  is being depleted and going into the bone.
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:45:58.520]  That's why they're going crazy.
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:01.520]  They're going crazy because the lead is coming out of their bones now for the first time
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:06.120]  in their lives. The lead is going from the bones into the blood. Now the lead in the
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:11.480]  blood gets into the brain, makes them crazy. This is where you get the syndrome of mean
[02:46:11.480 --> 02:46:12.480]  old women.
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:16.160]  This is exactly where it comes from. And also, pregnant women out there need to understand
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:20.920]  that your first child becomes really the dumping ground for a lot of the toxicity that your
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:26.120]  body has stored up. So if you're not cleaning your body and getting rid of all these elements
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:30.600]  and heavy metals and toxic chemicals, your first child is usually the most messed up
[02:46:30.600 --> 02:46:31.760]  because of this.
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:32.760]  That's right.
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:33.760]  And then the second child comes out.
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:38.040]  It's just like people exposed to Agent Orange, the first kid was always absolutely just devastated
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:40.080]  and then they got better as you went.
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:45.960]  Because the wisdom of the body, Alex, is amazing. Mother nature is amazing. The woman, the mother,
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:50.480]  her body is trying to get rid of this stuff for any way possible through the skin, through
[02:46:50.480 --> 02:46:56.320]  respiration, through feces, through urination, but also by dumping it into the fetus. And
[02:46:56.320 --> 02:46:59.840]  this is something that modern scientists and modern doctors just completely deny. They're
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:04.200]  living in total delusion world. They deny all of this. And as a result, our children
[02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:05.200]  are being poisoned.
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:08.120]  That's right, because in a genetic evolutionary way, and we don't mean the establishment
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:11.200]  evolution, but the clear development, it's more important for the woman to survive to
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:13.560]  make a bunch of kids than even the first one.
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:18.120]  Exactly. The male can be a lot more toxic because the sperm doesn't carry the load of
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:22.960]  heavy metals into the fetus, not at all. The sperm is really just digital information.
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:27.840]  It's the woman's body that provides the nourishment, the blood supply, the actual blood.
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:30.080]  And her eggs have to last 40 years.
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:35.600]  And if she has a female developing inside of her, she is also creating the eggs that
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:39.840]  that female would use to create the next generation. So it's daughter and grandma.
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:42.200]  And the mitochondrial transmission as well.
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:45.240]  The epigenetics, all of that, right on.
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:50.080]  So right now, isn't it really true from science that a woman is actually the human and that
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:52.360]  men are just a competitive manifestation?
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:57.600]  I've heard that description before, and I think some men do exist only for the sake
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:58.600]  of their sperm.
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:02.080]  No, but men are meant to be competitive, go out, do everything as the strength of the
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:03.080]  species.
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:04.080]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:05.920]  But that's the entire competitiveness.
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:10.240]  Yeah. Well, the male-female interaction is interesting from a physiological perspective.
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:15.640]  Males are the protectors, are the ones to provide the safety so the female can create
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:20.360]  future life. And the male is there to create genetic diversity as well, just from a pure
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:21.720]  genetics point of view.
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:25.920]  But again, we are living in a system right now, Alex, where it's already too late for
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:28.160]  grandchildren of today's pregnant women.
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:29.560]  It's already too late.
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:30.560]  They're already damaged.
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:31.560]  That's right.
[02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:32.560]  That's right.
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:37.040]  By third generation in just the GMO studies of the rats, they're dying.
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:40.880]  So basically, that's why they have to get world tyranny in, because in another 20 years,
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:42.640]  you're going to have 80% of people dying.
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:46.600]  If you cleaned up vaccines today and took all the mercury out and all the formaldehyde
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:50.800]  out, which is another neurotoxin I didn't even mention, if you took all that out today,
[02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:54.920]  you would still have children damaged from vaccines for two or three more generations
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:56.560]  from now.
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:00.240]  This is a sobering thought, and it's absolutely true.
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:04.160]  We are past the point of saving humanity from this devastation.
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:07.800]  The Holocaust is here, and we're going to feel it for three more generations.
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:10.280]  And that's why the globalists actually even talk about that.
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:11.760]  They did it on purpose.
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:14.880]  And so they just say, we're going to wipe you out, and they think science will rebuild
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:15.880]  some new human.
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:16.880]  Yeah.
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:17.880]  Right.
[02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:18.880]  Kurzweil style.
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:22.280]  They kill your physical body, copy your brain into a machine, and say you're still alive.
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:23.400]  You're not still alive.
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:25.320]  Your soul is long gone, man.
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:27.920]  Even if they could copy your brain, your soul is gone.
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:29.480]  The spirit is what makes you alive.
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:31.160]  Well, it's been shown that in clones.
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:36.640]  You give me the exact genetics with no mistakes, and it just fails to operate and is not animated.
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:37.640]  It's like nobody's home.
[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:41.280]  It's just without the spirit, you're not human.
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:45.520]  And this idea of consciousness is so dangerous to the establishment.
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:50.160]  This idea is the key to freeing humanity, in my opinion, consciousness.
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:57.440]  The idea that we are created from a greater consciousness, a greater power, that we have
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:49:59.760]  free will, that we have intelligence, that we have...
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:00.760]  Well, sure.
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:04.480]  Just from a scientific perspective of the studies that are coming out, it's almost like
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:09.800]  the intergalactic space wind that all this spectrum is energizing and resonating with
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:10.800]  us.
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:11.800]  Yes.
[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:12.800]  I would agree.
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:13.800]  We are not...
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:18.640]  Even quantum physics proves that we are not separate from everything else in the universe.
[02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:23.760]  This is built on the idea of scientific experimentation, which says the observer is independent and separate
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:25.440]  from the experiment.
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:27.240]  Quantum physics proves that that's not true.
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:30.360]  They don't even know why that when they watch something with a telescope now, they've done
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:33.360]  the math, it's affecting it a trillion miles away.
[02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:38.320]  Yes, because they now have teleportation of information faster than the speed of light,
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:39.680]  which was thought to be impossible.
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:43.400]  Alex, all these things we're talking about here, science has to be rewritten.
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:45.640]  There is more mystery to the universe.
[02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:48.240]  Well, the scientists, the top ones know this.
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:52.400]  They're there to give us a false science and keep people down because they've got us in
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:53.400]  a prison.
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:55.600]  Let's get into vaccines straight ahead.
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:51:01.200]  Powerful info with the health ranger Mike Adams.
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:02.200]  My name is Bruno.
[02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:03.200]  I'm 52 years old.
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:06.960]  I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:09.440]  I tried one world way and found it to be delicious.
[02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:13.760]  After 10 weeks on one world way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and your leaner than
[02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:15.240]  when you were 20 years old.
[02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:17.280]  My body has changed dramatically.
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:18.520]  I'm a cyclist.
[02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:21.440]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:26.200]  After being on one world way, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat.
[02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:29.800]  And then I take another two servings of one world way and then work out at the gym for
[02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:31.280]  another hour and a half.
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:33.640]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:37.920]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:39.320]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:42.960]  One world way comes in single servings, just give it a try.

[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:25.360]  All right folks, we've got calls from Germany, you name it, I'm going to have to go into
[02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:27.960]  overdrive and be able to take these but I'll try.
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:33.440]  Thanks for holding everybody that's on there, Tim, Chris, Marty, I'll try to get to all
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:36.600]  of you.
[02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:41.680]  Mike Adams, getting back to you, let's go into why we originally got you here, 10 outrageous
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:46.880]  but true facts about vaccines, the CDC, the vaccine industry doesn't want you to know about.
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:51.080]  So yeah, this is an article that I did that really ruffled a lot of feathers in the vaccine,
[02:54:51.080 --> 02:55:00.080]  the pro-vaccine movement, not a movement but corporate science scores, the eugenics movement.
[02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:05.320]  But people need to know the real facts about vaccines and they are, the CDC on their website,
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:11.320]  they still openly admit that vaccines contain these elements and can kill you.
[02:55:11.320 --> 02:55:17.440]  There was a big story that just came out recently about one of these big pharmacies that has
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:23.680]  a vaccine, it's called a high dose flu shot for senior citizens and the high dose flu
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:27.200]  shot on their website, I'm not going to mention their name, but on their website they say
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:32.560]  it has little to no side effects but if you actually look at the insert that's posted
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:38.600]  by the FDA, it says, wait a minute, this could kill you, this could cause neurological
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:49.600]  disease and epilepsy, it's all mentioned there, yes and 23 senior citizens died within a couple of months after taking the vaccine but they said, well this isn't related to it.
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:51.600]  Why not just euthanize them?
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:56.600]  I think this is a soft euthanization strategy, clearly, but it's also a lobotomization strategy.
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:56:06.600]  Now, getting back to the list though, vaccines are an important part of population control in the sense of making sure people don't get too intelligent.
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:14.600]  If you lobotomize or deactivate a portion of their brain, and I know you've covered this, through vaccines then you can prevent people from asking questions.
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:16.600]  Now asking questions is the basis of liberty.
[02:56:16.600 --> 02:56:19.600]  If you stop people from asking questions, you stop liberty.
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:21.600]  It's the essence of evil.
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:32.600]  Right, so these metals that are in vaccines that are added to vaccines on purpose, nutrients, right, to make the vaccines have a stronger reaction.
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:42.600]  These are so toxic that they were of course researched by Nazi scientists, and by the way, just as a side note, the sodium fluoride, because we talk about fluorine,
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:52.600]  sodium fluoride is the agent that the British press was reporting when they said the UK government authorized the sale of nerve gas chemicals to Syria.
[02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:57.600]  If you look at the reports, those nerve gas chemicals were sodium fluoride.
[02:56:57.600 --> 02:57:03.600]  So, sodium fluoride is the basis of nerve gas, and you mean vitamin gas.
[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:04.600]  Yeah, right.
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:11.600]  So, if you take sodium fluoride and through chemistry you can break apart the elements, you can get fluorine, and then you can use fluorine to make deadly nerve gas.
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:26.600]  So, in essence, the British press was admitting that the same chemical that's put into the Austin water supply is called a chemical weapons ingredient that was sold to Syria
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:27.600]  with great alarms.
[02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:31.600]  So, just so that everybody knows, this is the same thing we're talking about here.
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:36.600]  You're drinking raw materials for chemical weapons, and these were developed by Nazi scientists.
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:38.600]  That's where it all came from.
[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:42.600]  The IG Farben, Under Hitler, these were developed by Nazi scientists.
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:43.600]  Why are you being racist now?
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:49.600]  That's who eventually went on to be convicted of war crimes, the chairperson of Bayer, the pharmaceutical company.
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:52.600]  Shame folks that put HIV and the vaccine on purpose.
[02:57:52.600 --> 02:57:53.600]  Yes, very loving.
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:58.600]  So, we're going to make children's aspirin, so just so you know, and I couldn't say this if it weren't true.
[02:57:58.600 --> 02:58:04.600]  Oh no, we've got NBC reports where they got convicted in France knowingly putting it in the factor eight.
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:05.600]  But what's wrong with that?
[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:07.600]  You're racist if you don't kill him, affiliate.
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:19.600]  But not only is this poisoning our children, our parents are being denied due process in courts because the so-called secret vaccine court is higher than the Supreme Court in the United States according to the Supreme Court's own decision.
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:20.600]  It's the eugenics court.
[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:21.600]  The eugenics court.
[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:23.600]  But there's no due process.
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:27.600]  Just like family courts were set up 100 years ago for eugenics.
[02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:29.600]  That's how they sterilize people.
[02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:32.600]  This is a whole eugenics world.
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:33.600]  Stay there.
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:36.600]  We're going to come back and get into the breaking news at naturalnews.com.
[02:58:36.600 --> 02:58:39.600]  It's also on infowars.com, Inside Whole Foods.
