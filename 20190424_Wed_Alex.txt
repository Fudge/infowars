[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:11.000 --> 00:19.000]  President Trump, you must defend the First Amendment. You must stand up against big tech censorship.
[00:19.000 --> 00:25.000]  President Trump, you must stand up against big tech censorship. You must stand up for free speech.
[00:25.000 --> 00:36.000]  Now is the time. President Trump, you must release Julian Assange. Julian Assange, you're doing anything wrong, but it's a whistleblower, exposed criminal activity.
[00:36.000 --> 00:48.000]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:48.000 --> 01:07.000]  So there's Alex Jones in front of the White House yesterday while President Donald Trump was meeting with Jack Dorsey, the CEO-President founder of Twitter.
[01:07.000 --> 01:22.000]  So we're going to have more clips from Alex Jones yesterday bullhorning the White House and we will most likely be hearing from Alex Jones before the end of the broadcast today as well.
[01:22.000 --> 01:37.000]  But here's the deal, because I've got this stack of news, all kinds of stuff to get to. Something that really angered me yesterday and I lost my temper on air, it seems that the President has now responded, so that's great news.
[01:37.000 --> 02:01.000]  The President is listening to us, but we are growing weary of the lack of action, so will Twitter stop shadow banning conservatives? I doubt it, but will the President and Jack Dorsey hear that Alex Jones was outside and maybe even heard him with the bullhorn?
[02:01.000 --> 02:22.000]  Absolutely. Look, I'm not the one to judge somebody's fashion, but seriously, what is the deal with Jack Dorsey? Does this guy have no taste? Does this guy intentionally always want to look like a bum?
[02:22.000 --> 02:37.000]  He looks like he just got done panhandling on the side of the road. What is this guy's deal? He's in the White House. Come on, dude, comb your hair or something. What an embarrassment.
[02:37.000 --> 02:54.000]  Oh, and then the hilarity at CNN is just, I can't even. So I think we may actually be joined by Brian Stelter today. So I think that that's going to happen. Leo Zagami will be joining me.
[02:54.000 --> 03:11.000]  And then Patrick Casey from the American Identity Movement, whose video we featured yesterday of the gentleman dressed up as clowns in a clown world going to the drag queen story hour.
[03:11.000 --> 03:24.000]  And of course, they got kicked out. You're only allowed to be at drag queen story hour dressed like a clown if you're there to play with the kids. But if you're there to live in a clown world, you have to go.
[03:24.000 --> 03:39.000]  Look at that guy. Hold on, go back to the guy in the green shirt who's kicking them out and he puffs his belly out at them. It's really odd. And he's wearing sandals with socks too. Oh my gosh.
[03:39.000 --> 03:52.000]  Is he not wearing sandals with socks? I mean, am I am I wrong about this or those sandals with socks? And what are those track pants? This is an interesting fellow here. He may even have a whistle around his neck.
[03:52.000 --> 03:59.000]  All right, so so that's going to be happening too. But you know, before I do all that, I'm going to have to do four hours of broadcasting today.
[03:59.000 --> 04:10.000]  So I'm going to need my turbo force from infowarsstore.com. I already took my brain force and a couple of krill oil pills to really get my brain blasted. But I'm going to need a little extra energy today.
[04:10.000 --> 04:21.000]  So I'm going to take my turbo force right here. And I'm doing the hot water mix today. So we're going to be sipping on turbo force during the Alex Jones show today.
[04:21.000 --> 04:37.000]  So if you're wondering how I got all this energy, just saunter on over to infowarsstore.com and get yourself a box or 10 of turbo force from infowarsstore.com.
[04:37.000 --> 04:47.000]  All right, so I'm about to go into full chi mode. You know about this. It's a living meme. Just accept it. Just accept that turbo force has now become a living meme.
[04:47.000 --> 04:59.000]  And just go to infowarsstore.com and get your turbo force and be memorized as we go to break here on the Alex Jones show.
[04:59.000 --> 05:13.000]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us. And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need. You don't want the air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[05:13.000 --> 05:18.000]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities. How can I solve that problem?
[05:18.000 --> 05:32.000]  So we have air filters at infowarsstore.com, the Alexa pure breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa pure breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[05:32.000 --> 05:39.000]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now. We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[05:39.000 --> 05:51.000]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself. I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen with the Alexa pure breeze in your house.
[05:51.000 --> 06:11.000]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home. Have clean air. Go to infowarsstore.com.
[06:11.000 --> 06:22.000]  The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[06:22.000 --> 06:42.000]  You must stand up against that censorship. You must stand up against that censorship. You must stand up for free speech. Now is the time.
[06:42.000 --> 07:07.000]  That was the scene outside the White House yesterday when Alex Jones was visiting DC on a secret mission from an alternate dimension.
[07:07.000 --> 07:17.000]  While President Trump was talking to Jack Dorsey inside the White House, we're still trying to find a comb for Mr Dorsey.
[07:17.000 --> 07:36.000]  So we're going to have the full highlight video from yesterday of Alex Jones in Washington DC bullhorning the White House, walking around meeting people and doing his usual thing, which you will only find at infowars.com.
[07:36.000 --> 07:51.000]  But there is the president meeting with Jack Dorsey right there and it looks like he's got a team of lawyers with him, perhaps. And the president has all their attention.
[07:51.000 --> 08:08.000]  Daniels has the story at infowars.com. Trump holds closed door meeting with Twitter's Jack Dorsey. And of course, Trump tweeted this out, but you go back last year and you know what Trump has said during his rallies.
[08:08.000 --> 08:23.000]  And this is what he tweeted out last July. Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once. Many complaints.
[08:23.000 --> 08:46.000]  So you wonder if the president brought that up. But you can see in the picture that he shared on Twitter that we have it at infowars.com. He has a stack of news on his desk that he appears to be going over with Mr No Com, Jack Dorsey.
[08:46.000 --> 09:00.000]  And so, Alex Jones was in DC while this was all going on, bullhorning outside the White House doing his normal thing that you will only get here at infowars.
[09:00.000 --> 09:22.000]  You know, there is no other news organization where the face of the organization is actually the ones running everything and out in the front lines. You just don't get this anywhere else.
[09:22.000 --> 09:44.000]  So we're going to have the full highlight video of that coming up on the other side. And then there's all kinds of other news. It seems that the president is just as upset as we are about what happened at the southern border where Mexican soldiers disarmed American soldiers.
[09:44.000 --> 09:58.000]  The president is saying he believes it was a distraction. He believes it was a distraction for the drug smuggling that's going on, which I think I said that yesterday. I'm not sure. I'd have to go back and listen.
[09:58.000 --> 10:11.000]  But we talked about this yesterday. I lost my temper. And so we're going to be talking about that and some other news coming from the border, including a video we have of this is just breaking right now.
[10:11.000 --> 10:21.000]  A bunch of armed men escorting a caravan across the southern border.
[10:21.000 --> 10:37.000]  So you know, you've got videos of kids being drugged through barbed wire fence. You've got videos of kids at the top of fences. You've got videos of just armed men with rucksacks coming across.
[10:37.000 --> 10:48.000]  You've got drug smuggling coming across on video coyotes coming. It's all on video. Here's another one armed men escorting people. I mean, we're rolling this b-roll right now. It's incredible.
[10:48.000 --> 10:58.000]  So this is all going on at the southern border. But hey, it's liberal. It's progressive.
[10:58.000 --> 11:10.000]  No, you really have to wonder. You really have to wonder why our leaders are not doing anything about this. You've really got to wonder.
[11:10.000 --> 11:19.000]  Any sane person would accept the fact there is an emergency at the southern border.
[11:19.000 --> 11:37.000]  So you just ask yourself, what is driving these people insane? What is it? I mean, what do you have to see at the southern border to accept the reality?
[11:37.000 --> 11:54.000]  Again, kids being drugged through muddy water, drug across barbed wire on top of large walls, tens of thousands of people breaking through fences, breaking through police lines, throwing weapons,
[11:54.000 --> 12:12.000]  undercover video of them talking about how they're getting paid, people coming across with bags of drugs and guns, and you say, hey, we need to do something at the southern border.
[12:12.000 --> 12:26.000]  There's an emergency. It's kind of out of control. How dare you, racist? It's just like, what? And then, oh, who saw this coming?
[12:26.000 --> 12:37.000]  Infowars is tomorrow's news today. So what's the new narrative around Russian collusion? What is the new narrative? What is the big headline? What is everybody talking about?
[12:37.000 --> 12:47.000]  Don McGahn. So just get ready. Don McGahn will be on all the bottom lines for the next two days. Don McGahn. Don McGahn subpoenaed.
[12:47.000 --> 12:56.000]  Did Trump lie to Don McGahn? Was Don McGahn covering up for Trump? Who's Trump covering up for? Who is Don McGahn? Where is Don McGahn?
[12:56.000 --> 13:10.000]  So this is all coming. Don McGahn now obstructing justice with President Trump. Don McGahn now carrying Trump's water. It's all happening. Don McGahn is the president. It's not even Trump. It's Don McGahn.
[13:10.000 --> 13:23.000]  Just like it was, who else was there? I mean, should we go down the list of all the people that they've acted like this was the one, this was the be all, the end all, we finally got Trump? It's Don McGahn now.
[13:23.000 --> 13:44.000]  So the crew is just rolling through all the stories. It's the same old story. The criminal Democrats are engaged in a coup against the president, committing open treason. You can ask yourself why.
[13:44.000 --> 13:56.000]  But that's the same story, but it's now Don McGahn. So we're going to have all of that and more. I got a bunch of culture news, a stack of that as well.
[13:56.000 --> 14:18.000]  And let's not forget Leo Zagami is joining me at 11.30. And then Patrick Casey from the American Identity Movement, whose video we featured yesterday protesting the drag queen story hour. He will be joining me at 106 Central in the third hour.
[14:18.000 --> 14:40.000]  So before we go to this break, let me give you the good news. We still have 50% off all info wars apparel at infowarstore.com. This special has yet to be shut down. It's now 48 hours past its expiration date.

[15:15.000 --> 15:33.000]  What's going to happen in 2020 when people are rushing to info wars and looking for Alex Jones and everything on social media and YouTube because we were basically number one on the internet for political and presidential campaign coverage for 2016.
[15:33.000 --> 15:44.000]  What are they going to do when they see we're banned? What are they going to do? It's going to be an interesting next couple of years, isn't it?
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  It's only going to get stranger.
[15:48.000 --> 15:59.000]  So when we come back, we'll have the highlight reel of Alex Jones bullhorring the White House. But in this short four minute break, go to infowarstore.com and take advantage of 50% off all info wars apparel.

[18:17.000 --> 18:26.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.000 --> 18:37.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.000 --> 18:52.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.

[20:22.000 --> 20:31.000]  Looking live there at the White House lawn, Alex Jones, the controversial host, Trump's supporter, out there with a bullhorn,
[20:31.000 --> 20:38.000]  and that's what you heard earlier, some people out there as well, saying they support President Trump, but they don't support Twitter.
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000]  President Trump meeting with the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, here at the White House today.
[20:43.000 --> 20:53.000]  You kind of hear the bullhorn in the background, thought we'd show you.
[20:53.000 --> 21:08.000]  That was Brett Baer on Fox News yesterday. While the president was meeting with Jack Dorsey, he gives a shout out to Alex Jones, the controversial Alex Jones.
[21:08.000 --> 21:19.000]  Yes, make sure you add that caveat. But there you go. Hey, I actually give Brett credit to even save Voldemort's name on live television.
[21:19.000 --> 21:31.000]  So it's the small victories. But yes, you know, DC is buzzing right now, folks, and Alex Jones is still out there.
[21:31.000 --> 21:41.000]  And so I've got another story happening in DC right now that you're just not going to believe. In fact, I hope Alex runs into these people, quite frankly.
[21:41.000 --> 22:09.000]  And it would really be something. But before we get into what Alex may be doing today, here is a look at what Alex Jones was doing yesterday.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  It's Alex Jones in DC, shaking hands, carrying a bullhorn.
[22:39.000 --> 22:49.000]  President Trump must enforce the First Amendment in section 230 of the Telecommunications Act and stop Big Tech from making censors.
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.000]  The American people demand that their First Amendment be defended.
[22:55.000 --> 23:10.000]  President Trump has signed an executive order to stop colleges from banning free speech. That is the right move by the president. But the president must take action against Big Tech censorship now.
[23:10.000 --> 23:15.000]  All the evidence shows the Democrats already stole the last midterm election.
[23:15.000 --> 23:25.000]  They're openly bragging about the censorship that they're engaged in. And we, the people, must stand against this censorship.
[23:25.000 --> 23:41.000]  President Trump, you must defend free speech. President Trump, you must take action for the First Amendment for racketeering of Democrats and Big Tech are colluding together.
[23:41.000 --> 23:51.000]  And because the federal government has left a large vacuum open with no regulation against these censors, it is allowing the communists Chinese.
[23:51.000 --> 24:01.000]  It is allowing the authoritarian EU. And it's allowing the Hollywood leftist to by fiat create a world government censorship system.
[24:01.000 --> 24:11.000]  President Trump, your only area you're failing right now is because Congress won't let you defend the border and wouldn't give you the funding. We understand.
[24:11.000 --> 24:17.000]  But the place you can't take action is as a champion of the First Amendment.
[24:17.000 --> 24:31.000]  President Trump, you are allowing the EU and the communists Chinese and Big Tech to work together to censor. The argument that the government can't regulate these companies is bogus.
[24:31.000 --> 24:39.000]  Don't let the American people that elected you be silenced stand for the First Amendment.
[24:39.000 --> 24:58.000]  You know about the censorship. You know what's happened. Stand against the fake news. It is critical for you, President Trump, to take action against the globalist and the Chinese cops working with traitors in our country to censor the American people.
[24:58.000 --> 25:13.000]  President Trump, you must take action against the censors. You must take action against Big Tech. You must take action against the globalist. You must take action against the NWO.
[25:13.000 --> 25:31.000]  We have the internal documents and videos of Google, Facebook and Twitter admitting their incredible censorship of the American people. We have the evidence of their collusion. We have the head of Google saying we're doing this to stop Trump winning again.
[25:31.000 --> 25:43.000]  And then they lie to Congress, President Trump. They lie to Congress, President Trump. And they say they never censor anybody. They never censor the conservative. They never fix the search for an adult.
[25:43.000 --> 26:02.000]  Big Tech is loyal. Ipohors.com has been standing for the republic. So has News Wars.com. And we have honorably been fighting for this republic in its remote. And the independent press that got you elected needs the cavalry to come, President Trump.
[26:02.000 --> 26:14.000]  Big Tech must be broken up. Big Tech is working with Congress, China. It's working with the EU. It's working with others to openly censor not just their people, but us.
[26:14.000 --> 26:33.000]  This is the foreign election meddling, President Trump. This is the globalism. But America's fighting back. And thanks to your leadership, we're away. But we need you to stand against Big Tech censorship, President Trump. President Trump, America, listen to you.
[26:33.000 --> 26:51.000]  We stood up. We got you elected. You defeated the fake Russian gate hopes. But now you must defeat the attempt to destroy the First Amendment. President Trump, please save the First Amendment. Please do the right thing and stand up against Big Tech.
[26:51.000 --> 27:05.000]  You will not win the 2020 election unless you stop the censorship because they'll steal the election as they already planned to do. And you won't have the people's voice there when the whole corporate media turns against you.
[27:05.000 --> 27:25.000]  The Fox News is already starting to turn against you. Now is the time, ladies and gentlemen. Now is the time to stand for the First Amendment. Now is the time to stand up against the Chai cops and the EU working with Big Tech to restrict free speech.
[27:25.000 --> 27:37.000]  Now is the time to stand against these censors and take action. This is the right thing to do. It's the right thing for the country. It's the right thing for America.
[27:37.000 --> 27:55.000]  And the censorship is incredible. And the censorship is un-America. And the censorship is illegal. President Trump, stand up for the First Amendment.
[27:55.000 --> 28:23.000]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. Alex Jones.
[28:23.000 --> 28:45.000]  Bullhorning outside the White House. Now, I've got a bullhorn right here. This bullhorn is legendary. And I'm actually sending this bullhorn out today to an info warrior.
[28:45.000 --> 28:59.000]  And who knows, if you play your cards right, you may get the Info Wars legendary bullhorn next. This is the Alex Jones show. We'll be right back.
[28:59.000 --> 29:17.000]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:17.000 --> 29:23.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[30:00.000 --> 30:06.000]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, know that they can food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.

[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long. Go ahead.
[31:03.000 --> 31:10.000]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bracking. It just gets old now.
[31:10.000 --> 31:15.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay? We're taking calls about your nomination.
[31:15.000 --> 31:22.000]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down? Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[31:22.000 --> 31:29.000]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down? Is that what you want, Frank?
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.000]  You know what, Alex?
[31:30.000 --> 31:38.000]  Hey, put him on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[31:38.000 --> 31:45.000]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this. I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank. I need your help, Frank.
[31:49.000 --> 31:55.000]  Go to M4store.com right now and help fund the M4.
[31:55.000 --> 32:00.000]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank. Free Press needs your help, Frank.
[32:00.000 --> 32:13.000]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[32:13.000 --> 32:25.000]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the young turds and others, get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[32:25.000 --> 32:31.000]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[32:31.000 --> 32:36.000]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary and others, are trying to shut M4's down.
[32:36.000 --> 32:44.000]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war.
[32:44.000 --> 32:53.000]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us,
[32:53.000 --> 33:00.000]  in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water. I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, infowarstore.com. Thank you.
[33:23.000 --> 33:30.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[33:30.000 --> 33:39.000]  Well, I'm about to be joined by one of the most legendary Jedi's in all of the galaxy.
[33:39.000 --> 33:53.000]  Leo Zagami from LeoZagami.com is about to be joining me. We sell his books at infowars.com, and I brought Leo on today to really get the audience woke.
[33:53.000 --> 34:04.000]  And there's so much in the news today. I was wondering how I was even going to segue into this conversation I want to have with Leo today, but it turns out he's written the perfect story to do just that.
[34:04.000 --> 34:12.000]  It's at LeoZagami.com. Joe Biden, the Vatican candidate choice for 2020. Now, there's some interesting things in this story.
[34:12.000 --> 34:27.000]  One is this Cura Foundation and how it's linked to the Vatican and then kind of the dystopian biotech tyranny that it seems to be aligned with.
[34:27.000 --> 34:35.000]  But then two, I realized something going over the story before Leo joined us.
[34:35.000 --> 34:48.000]  Leo, it does appear to me that Joe Biden is the globalist candidate, and should we even dare say the secret societies, the Illuminati candidate.
[34:48.000 --> 35:00.000]  And I realize this now, they're in big trouble because even though he's pulling high right now, I'm not sure how realistic those polls are.
[35:00.000 --> 35:08.000]  And they're going to have a tough time getting Joe Biden into the White House. He's very old. Trump is having a lot of success right now.
[35:08.000 --> 35:18.000]  And I mean, let's not forget all the Biden groping videos that just went viral. I mean, those aren't going to go to rest. So it appears to me, Leo, correct me if I'm wrong,
[35:18.000 --> 35:30.000]  Biden, as you have it here in your headline, the Vatican candidate, but really that means the New World Order candidate, which to me means the New World Order is in quite a pinch.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  Leo Zagami.
[35:32.000 --> 35:42.000]  Yeah, it is definitely losing some points. This New World Order with this candidate who is not very credible to, at least to our eyes, our conservative eyes.
[35:42.000 --> 35:49.000]  But I'm sure that he has a very large audience of Libtards all over the world ready to endorse him.
[35:49.000 --> 36:04.000]  And of course, I pointed out just with this photo that I put in this article is next to Lady Gaga, for example, who is a known Luciferian during the documentary on Lady Gaga by Netflix.
[36:04.000 --> 36:19.000]  They actually played the music Lucifer Rising by Bobby Bessolero, which is one of the assassins of the Charles Manson massacres. And we are talking here about a candidate who is definitely endorsed because one year ago, exactly one year ago,
[36:19.000 --> 36:28.000]  there was this gathering in the Vatican called Unite to Cure, how science technology in the 21st century will impact culture and society.
[36:28.000 --> 36:39.000]  Now, everybody that is anybody in the Libtard movement was there. And there were, of course, Dr. Sanya Gupta from CNN.
[36:39.000 --> 36:47.000]  And then we had Defak Chopra. We had Jack Nicolaus. We had Katy Perry. We had many people.
[36:47.000 --> 36:56.000]  Oh, Katy Perry, the one that was trying to steal that house in California from the nuns? The one that was petitioning the Pope?
[36:56.000 --> 37:08.000]  Well, of course, you have to be a Satanist or an Illuminati. Peter Gabriel, for example, was there. And we know that in the 80s, he already pioneered the symbolism of the Illuminati in one of his videos.
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.000]  So we are talking here about people that at the core of the New World War, including David Lynch.
[37:14.000 --> 37:23.000]  So these people met one year ago in the Vatican. And they said in one year from now, we're going to announce this candidacy to the world.
[37:23.000 --> 37:32.000]  And I tell you, I mean, we might underestimate it, but I say let's be careful about this candidate because he could reserve some surprises.
[37:32.000 --> 37:39.000]  It's very powerful. And of course, they can play some dirty tricks in 2020s around the corner.
[37:39.000 --> 37:46.000]  So let's see what happens. But the candidacy of Joe Biden would be announced in the next 24 to 48 hours.
[37:46.000 --> 37:53.000]  So exactly one year after this Vatican meeting where he spoke. So do you think this is a coincidence?
[37:53.000 --> 38:02.000]  I don't believe in coincidences in this setup because these are people who know exactly what they're going to be doing in two years from now.
[38:02.000 --> 38:09.000]  They're not people like me and you and they have an agenda schedule. Everything is really calculated to the detail.
[38:09.000 --> 38:17.000]  So they knew exactly what they were doing. That's why I pointed out that he is the candidate of choice for the Vatican.
[38:17.000 --> 38:28.000]  And of course, the Jesuits are the ones who are the moment on both sides of the ocean are trying to push for this open borders immigrant policy.
[38:28.000 --> 38:37.000]  And they are on one side here in Europe with the John Claude Ulrich, which is another John Claude and he's actually friend and fellow Luxembourg,
[38:37.000 --> 38:50.000]  a bogus John Claude Junker. So these two people, John Claude Ulrich is the head Jesuit who controls is the president of the European conferences of the Catholic Church.
[38:50.000 --> 38:59.000]  So we're talking here about this power of the Jesuits that is openly endorsing migration. They're doing the same thing as I reported also a week ago.
[38:59.000 --> 39:07.000]  And John Claude Junker is literally a Nazi fortune heir. But the guy's like stumbling around drunk all the time now.
[39:07.000 --> 39:16.000]  I mean, I don't know what his deal is. But Leo, I want to bring this back to the candidacy of Joe Biden because the force is strong day.
[39:16.000 --> 39:23.000]  I was wondering how I was going to get into this with you, but it kind of parallels what I wanted to talk with you today about how much power.
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.000]  So folks can go get Leo's books at infowars.com. They're just amazing stuff.
[39:29.000 --> 39:39.000]  And in fact, you even, we had you on the war room to discuss this, you even accurately predicted the New Zealand shooting in your most recent book.
[39:39.000 --> 39:49.000]  So you've been studying, you've been a part of, you've been writing about the Illuminati, the secret societies that they've been around for hundreds of years,
[39:49.000 --> 39:55.000]  some aspects of these even longer. But the ones that were really in power, I would say probably came out of Germany.
[39:55.000 --> 40:01.000]  You would agree a few hundred years ago, and they've been the ones kind of bringing in all of this technology and everything.
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.000]  But this is my question. How much power over the world should we say?
[40:08.000 --> 40:15.000]  Do these secret societies still have? Do they still have the same amount of power that they had 30 years ago leading up to this point
[40:15.000 --> 40:23.000]  and have new secret societies kind of informing in Silicon Valley with upstarts and the technology boom and all the access?
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  Has that kind of mitigated the secret societies power? Do they still have the power they once wielded?
[40:28.000 --> 40:34.000]  And to me, I think it all kind of can parallel the story you wrote.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  Here's Joe Biden, the New World Order Illuminati candidate.
[40:38.000 --> 40:47.000]  And I mean, I don't think his chances are good. And if this is what they're banking on to try to take back power and control in the West,
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  I mean, that's like you said, I mean, that dodge aren't good for them.
[40:50.000 --> 40:57.000]  So do you think that parallels where these secret societies and the power that they've had over the world for so long?
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Do you think this parallels where they're at right now?
[40:59.000 --> 41:05.000]  Or do you think they still have the same ability to basically do and pull whatever strings they want?
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  Or simply have still all the cash in the world and more.
[41:10.000 --> 41:19.000]  So until you control the finances of this planet, you actually control who is printing the money, you are controlling the whole show.
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  So I don't think that we're getting rid of this kind of people.
[41:23.000 --> 41:34.000]  I mean, they can have their internal wars, but in the end, they are the most rich and powerful people on the planet and institutions like the church are also very rich.
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  So how are we going to overcome this materialistic power?
[41:40.000 --> 41:50.000]  It's very difficult to overcome this materialistic power if not with a spiritual and cultural revolution that has to be started in a nation that is truly free.
[41:50.000 --> 42:02.000]  Nowadays, there is only the United States of America that we can call really free because the rest of the world is falling under socialist rule and
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  techno-technocratic dictatorship.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  So all over the place.
[42:06.000 --> 42:12.000]  So basically, we are now with Donald J. Trump, the only place the United States of America.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  But how long this is going to last?
[42:14.000 --> 42:20.000]  I mean, they have immense power, unfortunately, and not at the spiritual level.
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  And that's why they're destroying places of cult.
[42:24.000 --> 42:43.000]  Because you see places of cult since ancient times are places where you gather an aggregate, you gather a spiritual force through the power of prayer, through the rosaries that in the Catholic Church, the old ladies, they are praying on one holy Mary after the other.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  It's the same concept that is also repeated in Islam.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  They do the same thing.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  All right, let's talk about this.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  We're going to break Leo.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  Let's get into more of this on the other side.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  Leo Zagami is going to be with us for an hour today.
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  Don't go anywhere.
[42:54.000 --> 43:23.000]  We'll be right back.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  We'll be right back.
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  We'll be right back.
[43:56.000 --> 44:24.000]  We'll be right back.
[44:24.000 --> 44:29.000]  Again, we've got four or five places we want to fill and a lot of news secret projects going on.
[44:29.000 --> 44:37.000]  The point is if you want to build freedom in this country and promote free speech and you want to help Info Wars go to the next level, we want to hire you.

[47:11.000 --> 47:24.000]  Music
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  Oh, and Troyer here filling in for Alex Jones today.
[47:27.000 --> 47:33.000]  He is still on a special mission in D.C.
[47:33.000 --> 47:41.000]  And I am joined by Leo Zagami and we are talking about his story.
[47:41.000 --> 47:49.000]  Joe Biden, the Vatican candidate of choice for 2020 and who's really behind that and what that really means.
[47:49.000 --> 48:00.000]  And so, I mean, the things that stuck out to me, Leo, and you can get back into going into the spiritual war that you were getting into in the last segment before we had to go to break.
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  And that's really what this comes down to.
[48:03.000 --> 48:18.000]  And so that's why they bring people out like Katy Perry to push their symbolism and stuff and then go to these conferences where they push biotech and biomedical tyranny and they roll it out like it's cool and trendy.
[48:18.000 --> 48:24.000]  And don't worry about what's behind it, you know, don't worry about what we really want to use it for.
[48:24.000 --> 48:30.000]  And so, but they've run into kind of a an obstacle here with with Joe Biden not being so popular.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  And so if they do force him in, I mean, America is going to be like, well, what the heck just happened here?
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  I think I don't know if America is that dead yet.
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  But you were getting into the spiritual aspects of this.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  I mean, you'd see Joe Biden's creepy smile the way he touches and gropes children and women.
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.000]  I think we understand what side of the spiritual battle he is on.
[48:49.000 --> 48:57.000]  But, you know, Leo, this is in, I mean, this is a battle as ancient as time itself between good and evil.
[48:57.000 --> 49:03.000]  And I think people are finally starting to become akin to it again.
[49:03.000 --> 49:14.000]  They're kind of starting to get, of course, aware of it because thanks to us and other mediums that maybe before were not obtainable,
[49:14.000 --> 49:24.000]  we can put through our theories, our hypothesis, but also the truth on many things that unfortunately is censored by mainstream media.
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  But mainstream media is controlled by them.
[49:27.000 --> 49:34.000]  So they will have an immense power if Trump doesn't really unblock the situation.
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  That's why what Alex is doing in Washington DC is very important, of course.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  And what's happening with Dorsey and the whole show with Twitter, these people control Silicon Valley.
[49:44.000 --> 49:52.000]  Of course, they have invested a lot of money in it and they also ideologically control it because that's the way it is.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  I mean, recently I was contacted by somebody in San Francisco.
[49:56.000 --> 50:05.000]  They had difficulty in organizing an event for me there because, of course, the way things are down there in California.
[50:05.000 --> 50:11.000]  But regarding Joe Biden, we have a person who is endorsed directly by the Pope.
[50:11.000 --> 50:19.000]  I mean, we're talking about a conference which was arranged with the imprimatur of the Vatican.
[50:19.000 --> 50:25.000]  Let me ask you this question though. When did we see this public flip from the Vatican?
[50:25.000 --> 50:28.000]  I was raised Catholic. I went to Catholic school.
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  I saw the Pope when he came to St. Louis.
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  I mean, I went to pro-life marches.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  When did the Catholic Church all of a sudden become pro-choice?
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  I mean, this is really strange. When did this happen?
[50:38.000 --> 50:46.000]  Because even not too long ago, the Catholic Church and the Pope has always been publicly pro-choice, very adamant.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  Now we have a pro-life. Excuse me.
[50:49.000 --> 50:54.000]  Now we have a pro-choice, supporting pro-choice in America.
[50:54.000 --> 50:59.000]  When did this flip happen? I guess they're just taking the mask off now.
[50:59.000 --> 51:04.000]  They're taking the mask off, but they have been gradually taking it off since the end of the 60s,
[51:04.000 --> 51:09.000]  when the Second Vatican Council started to come into fruition.
[51:09.000 --> 51:13.000]  And people like Ratzinger, of course, but also Jesuits.
[51:13.000 --> 51:20.000]  The Jesuits were very important in this Second Vatican Council, and they came out with all these liberal policies soon after.
[51:20.000 --> 51:27.000]  So jump on the second briefly. At the beginning of the day, they started to oppose it, but then they took over the show.
[51:27.000 --> 51:34.000]  So this is really the making of the Jesuits, this order that really doesn't care about Christianity.
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  It actually wants to destroy Christianity in favor of this one world religion.
[51:38.000 --> 51:49.000]  So they have already secretly converted to Islam, a lot of them, because it's the religion they're going to use in the coming years.
[51:49.000 --> 51:56.000]  And they know this very well. The Vatican calculates also how many people are arriving from these countries,
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.000]  how many newborns. We know that in the West we don't have as many children as the Muslims,
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  so it's very easy for them to take over the show.
[52:04.000 --> 52:11.000]  But when this show will be taken over, that's the moment in which you will receive the mark of the beast.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  That's when we will embrace...
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  Is this just basic mathematics?
[52:15.000 --> 52:22.000]  I mean, are we talking about basic logistics with these secret societies determining that they're going to bring in Islam as the one world religion?
[52:22.000 --> 52:28.000]  Is that because there's billions and billions of Muslims out there and they can move them about the planet?
[52:28.000 --> 52:35.000]  No, I think it's because of the manipulative way they can use Islam.
[52:35.000 --> 52:43.000]  It's easier to use because here in the West they have gradually destroyed Christianity after the Age of Enlightenment.
[52:43.000 --> 52:51.000]  They have created a situation, the Illuminati here in the West, whereby we don't really care much about the Bible.
[52:51.000 --> 52:58.000]  At least the average person in Europe, especially, they are very secularized and very lichesized.
[52:58.000 --> 53:04.000]  So, I mean, we are in front of a situation where you don't have Christian values like before,
[53:04.000 --> 53:11.000]  so Islam is still very strong, it's a combative force they can use as a Trojan horse to then install this one.
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  Well, I actually want to bear down on this point, Leo, and I've explained this before,
[53:15.000 --> 53:22.000]  and this is how people like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaab and these other people are getting in office because, you know,
[53:22.000 --> 53:30.000]  Christians in the West and just in general, voters in the West, they take these practices for granted now.
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.000]  Christians aren't going to church. That was mainstream news just last week, how church attendance is way down.
[53:36.000 --> 53:41.000]  People don't identify as even religious anymore, and this is all part of the propaganda.
[53:41.000 --> 53:46.000]  I experienced this when I went to college. There's a graph that the crew found right there,
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.000]  the great decline, 60 years of religion in America, it's declining.
[53:50.000 --> 53:56.000]  And so, you've kind of got that happening, and I feel that...
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  But it's not a coincidence. It's been planned with the Second Vatican Council.
[54:01.000 --> 54:08.000]  You have to understand this was a key moment in which, for the first time, the church came together in modern times
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  after the Second World War to plan this new world order.
[54:12.000 --> 54:17.000]  But what I'm saying is, Christians and voters in the West, they take it all for granted.
[54:17.000 --> 54:25.000]  When Muslims come here, they all vote. They all go to their religious service. They don't miss it, ever.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  They're always doing it. And so, that's why, I forget, I did a breakdown of this,
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.000]  but you can go look at the numbers specifically using a case study at Ilhan Omar's district.
[54:34.000 --> 54:42.000]  Muslim voter turnout for that district was, like, 98% compared to the rest, which was down at, like, 60%.
[54:42.000 --> 54:48.000]  So, yeah, Muslims come here and they engage because they can practice their religion freely,
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  and they engage because they have these rights to vote.
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.000]  And so, they realize... So, it's kind of like, oh, we can use that and manipulate that.
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.000]  Christians and Westerners aren't voting. They aren't praying. They aren't procreating.
[55:02.000 --> 55:08.000]  But these people we're bringing from the Middle East, they are. So, we kind of use that as the new power wing.
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  I saw it myself when I used to live in Scandinavia with my own eyes.
[55:12.000 --> 55:19.000]  Muslims were very active politically in places like Oslo, for example, in Norway.
[55:19.000 --> 55:27.000]  And, I mean, they were taking over already seats in the local seats here in the commune, basically.
[55:27.000 --> 55:34.000]  And that was many years ago. So, I mean, this getting involved with politics for the Muslims means getting involved with power.
[55:34.000 --> 55:42.000]  We're going to see more and more Islamic political parties in the next few years coming up all over the place.
[55:42.000 --> 55:48.000]  So, they're going to be like a plague. And the fact that they can expand...
[55:48.000 --> 55:54.000]  It doesn't mean necessarily that they are promoting terrorism, but they are covering up for...
[55:54.000 --> 56:00.000]  And we're kind of digressing from the main topic, but I kind of want to actually continue down this road for a second.
[56:00.000 --> 56:06.000]  I mean, if they're going to... Because they all vote Democrat. I mean, they just had the story.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  It was like, I think, 80 or 75 percent or something vote Democrat, Muslim voters.
[56:10.000 --> 56:18.000]  So, what do we do? I mean, I see here and I'm like, well, it's Muslims in the UK that are fighting against the queer education
[56:18.000 --> 56:25.000]  kids how to be trans and gay. It's the Muslims in the West that I feel like will fight against that same thing.
[56:25.000 --> 56:32.000]  Have Democrats and Muslims that vote Democrat, have they just not had this clash of ideologies realized yet?
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  Or do you think that they just don't care?
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.000]  They don't care. The interests that are moved from on top of all this, they don't really care.
[56:40.000 --> 56:49.000]  I mean, you have to understand that the Luminati of Adam Beishap, when they were born in 1776, they were really inspired
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.000]  by some elements of the Muslim tradition and they filter it through the secret societies that took their place.
[56:55.000 --> 57:06.000]  So, basically, Islam has always had a secret footstep here in the West, in these secret societies that secretly have dealt
[57:06.000 --> 57:17.000]  with unspeakable deals with the Muslim world. And so, we are in front of a conspiracy to destroy Christianity,
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  but also in the end, they will destroy Islam when they don't need it any longer.
[57:22.000 --> 57:28.000]  I mean, the thing is that the ordinary Muslims, they lose themselves.
[57:28.000 --> 57:33.000]  And we're going to break here, but yeah, I mean, if they can get a one-world religion, it's really going to be Satanism.
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  I mean, they'll claim it's atheism or whatever, but it's really Satanism.
[57:37.000 --> 57:42.000]  So, we'll get into that. Leo, we got to take a break. Leo Zagami with us, leozagami.com.

[59:13.000 --> 59:39.000]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[59:39.000 --> 59:44.000]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what, I'm just obsessed,
[59:44.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  Well, I think at some point in your life, you looked around at humanity, you analyzed where it was going,
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  went back into the past, saw where it came from, and just kind of shook your head in disbelief,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  thought this can't be what our destiny is. This can't be what we were meant for.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  Got corrupted somewhere along the way. Some of us made a deal with the devil.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  So, Leo Zagami is expert, all things expert when it comes to secret societies, and the Vatican, and he's got his latest story,
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Joe Biden, the Vatican candidate of choice for 2020. But isn't that what it all really is, Leo?
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Isn't that what it all really boils down to? These people have made deals with entities that they believe are the devil.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  Of course. And we have to understand that Islam is important for them because these entities are very present in this religion.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  They call them gene. They have also mysterious figure known as al-Qaeda, which is the degree.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  A lot of paganism.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  A lot of elements of magic that are then present also in a minor way, sometimes in Christianity.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  But I was just reading a moment ago, something written in the context of Crawleyianity, Alistair Crawley, who was a big admirer of Islam.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  He actually identified Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, with a saint of his own church.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  Now, how comes one of the biggest Satanists, Alistair Crawley, is identifying the prophet of Islam as a saint?
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  This should give you an idea. Also, the fact that it condones pedophilia Islam, it gives, of course, for the future, the Vatican, they all love it.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  Islam, of course. Let's open a caliphate in the Vatican. Let's open a sultanate in the Vatican. This is what is going to happen soon because they have already changed behind closed doors their religion.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Do you think we could actually see a physical representation of this in Paris at the Notre Dame Cathedral because they said they're going to have a competition to decide what they're going to do with the new spire in the top?
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  I mean, to me, this gives them an opening, at least, to put a crowning jewel on France with some globalist or Illuminati symbolism up there, and that'll be their physical marking like we captured you.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  Well, they want to build a minaret. That's what one of the proposals is saying, and I think that it's not far-fetched to say that this is definitely not going to be a traditional Christian church.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  It's going to be open to all religions, and they have already done this experiment a few years ago in a secret in Rome, in a church, one of the most ancient churches of Christianity was desecrated by this experiment.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  The church of Santa Croce in Jerusalem, they used it for a period of time about, I think it was around six months of time, they started using one of the chapels for all the religions as a one-word religion chapel.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  And this was done in Rome, and it was done almost covertly for a number of months until, of course, they started to be a little bit of media exposure around this thing.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  And so in the church, which actually is Santa Croce in Jerusalem, is the church where they keep the nails of the cross of Christ, is also regarded as the most ancient church in Christianity, because it was the villa of the mother of the Emperor Constantine.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  They actually started to open up to the one-word religion 10 years ago, and they're doing this one day after the other.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  Well, to me, we're going to break here, short break. To me, you just made a bold prediction, and I mean, if I was a betting man, your predictions are about as solid as they get.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  So you think that they're going to not just have some symbolism with a new spire or top, they're going to just go and just remove it as a Catholic or Christian monument in general.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  More from Leo Zagami on the other side of this short break.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  So Leo, I want to just get right back into this because you made to me a pretty bold prediction.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  I think people should stick that in their back pocket and wait for it to come true.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  You're predicting they're going to kind of transfer the meaning or the practice inside of the Notre Dame Cathedral away from being Christian and Catholic church services to being a one world religion center.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  And then I'm expecting them to have a physical manifestation of this when they replace the spire with some new different symbolism which by the way and maybe we get to this in the next segment is all over the United States.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  But we won't get into that now.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  So Leo, I mean here's it's like this.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  This is actually perfect for you to comment on.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  Did you see the picture and the rumors are out there about what it is but a picture of Michelle Obama toasting you know with the with the champagne glass and it appears in the reflection I mean she was on a boat going on a river cruise right by the cathedral that that we know is true.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  But it appears in the reflection of the picture that they put out.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  It appears that she's she's toasting champagne while the cathedral is burning.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  And I mean it seems so out there it seems so far fetched but when you really know what's going on you know the dark Satanism that's going on.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  And then you even understand the psychology and I don't even want to get into the psychology of a potentially who a Michael Obama really is.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  But but I mean Leo, was this an Illuminati sacrifice.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  I mean was this a big date like 9 11 changed the way of the West.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  Was this a big monumental moment for the Illuminati in Europe.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  Absolutely because like I was trying to explain you before it's a very complex thing to explain but very synthetically inside every church you give energy by praying a specific prayer of course of your religion.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  If you want to change this force you want to detonate you want to basically eliminate it you have to bend out that place because that place is full of these energies that have been kept there for centuries.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  So the moment in which you use fire fire is a specific element in Islam.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  The genies of fire is the demonic ones who really have power over the dark forces and this is actually I just want to put this into layman's terms.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  Basically so so you have all of this powerful energy worshipping God empowering God bringing humans together from all around the world to this cathedral.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  Praising Jesus using that positive energy which is still in Europe that they're trying to destroy right now.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  And so you burn it down with fire and if you look into these occult practices that they do they always have to use fire to connect to communicate with these demons.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  They're attracted to fire and death so fires in the easy one that they kick up a fire and they can communicate with these demons.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  So I just wanted to kind of put that into layman's terms but you're getting next level so it's like an unbelievable transfer of energy in one fell swoop.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Yes the energy is liberated and you're never going to recover those prayers because they're going to just go up to the heavens where they belong to.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  But that power was for many centuries in this place like many others of worship.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  So when you want to change the tune the only way is to destroy the place and then rebuild it with a different kind of worship.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  This was done many times in the past even before Christianity we had pagan cults that then Christianity took over.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  I mean some places have a specific also connotation because they are placed there where there is electromagnetic forces that are specific to that longitude and latitude.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  So Notre Dame is that place and it's a key place together with the pyramid that you know in Paris was built relatively new pyramid that we find in Paris.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Now we have Notre Dame going down and of course then we have to have another form of worship that embraces all the religions and of course there is also another point that they're going to make in the coming years.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  Christianity will be deemed offensive and so the symbols of Christianity will be deemed offensive in the West.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  When you're seeing that they won't even say Christianity they say Easter worshipers now.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  Yeah you have to understand also the beliefs of the Muslims.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  When you go in a mosque there is no symbols of any kind really apart from many geometrical patterns but there is forbidden to have anything that resembles an image.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  And that's the other thing too because there is a lot of paganism when it comes to Islam.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  They give their energy each day all together millions of individual worldwide certain amount of times a day with a certain amount of prayers that is their power and is pointed towards Mecca.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  But yeah so Mecca you know whatever but whatever it is again I just viewed as paganism.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  But what I'm saying is I feel like though I feel like a certain there was something else happening to humanity all at once because we're all connected.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  I mean we were all connected divinely and I think people were watching the Notre Dame Cathedral burn and at the end of the day I mean what really happened we don't know but at the end of the day nobody died or got hurt.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  It was just a structure that burned but there was everybody knew there was something else happening.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Everybody was so enamored by it and they didn't even know why but that's it.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  I mean it's an unbelievable transfer of energy.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  And there was the al-Aqsa mosque burning at the same time in Jerusalem.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  That is something also which fits this whole show because in the end of the day yes Notre Dame is going down.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  But let me show you that the next ones to go down after this Christianity goes down then it's going to be Islam.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  So this is a diabolical plan.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  This is a satanic plan that even the Muslims know themselves about but unfortunately they're falling trap.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  They're in a trap themselves.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  So I am saying today to your viewers that here there is powers and that are not of this earth only.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  When I talked before about Mecca there is a mystery regarding Mecca that go well beyond Islam.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  Because it's something that goes into antiquity.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  Something that is to do with probably a meteorite that is not of this planet that is worshipped and creates energy
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  and that when you go around it you create a certain amount of energy.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  So these are things that of course will have to be studied and understood.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  But if in a simple way we can say that there are mantras in Arabic that they will start to recite daily next to Notre Dame
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  until they get into Notre Dame and then they can worship their God and take over the place.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  So we're going to be following this Leo because I have a feeling that this will probably come down in just kind of like it'll go uncovered.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Like the one other church you mentioned in Italy where they just kind of bring in like oh it's a one religion.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  You know everybody's welcome here and then they'll eventually say oh no but Christianity is offensive.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  They're already symboling that that's what they're going to do.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  They won't say Christians.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  They say Easter worshippers and I would imagine that this is probably going to happen pretty soon
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  because they're already pushing to rebuild the cathedral.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  I want to give a scoop today to your viewers just something that maybe you should think about.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  The Muslims hate the cross but there is a reason that was also embraced by the Nice Templars.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  They believe that Jesus didn't die on the cross.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  It says it on the Quran.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  At the last minute they sent somebody else.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  Now the Nice Templar embraced this and they made it into the 30th degree initiation of the ancient and accepted Scottish right.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  In which the Nice Templars are basically spitting on the cross not because of this respect necessarily to Jesus but to the fact that he was put on the cross.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  So then there is people who say that Jesus lived long.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  I went into the Middle East, I went to Egypt, I studied in the Coptic churches to understand if there was some basis to these theories that Jesus lived.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  And from my experience I found that he lived and this is historic but of course it will change the face of Christianity to know that he didn't die or that his dying was symbolic.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  I can't even believe that you went down this road.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  I didn't plan on doing this in the final segment with you but now I feel like we have to talk about this in the final segment here or maybe even hold you longer.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  But yeah that's kind of a big thing and I've always wondered because I see the false flags and stuff happening.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  Now that's not new. The Romans used to do that stuff too.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  I mean so it's like who knows what happens.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  Hey guys it's Scott Bauer here CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.

[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  After my divorce I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  After my second DWI and arrest my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  I thought I could quit on my own but I couldn't. It hit me when I was arrested.

[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Oh and Troy are filling in for Alex today.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  Should be back with us tomorrow. Leo Zagami is my guest.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Now Leo just dropped a bombshell on us here. I guess you could say in the last segment and I just want to reiterate it.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  Make sure I understood it correctly. There is a certain sect of the Scottish right,
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  which is linked to the Freemasons in the West, which is linked to the founding of this country that teaches at the highest levels,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  essentially that the crucifixion of Jesus was a false flag and that it was not actually Jesus that was crucified that day.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  So Leo, I can't let you say that and then not get more into it.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  Leo Zagami from LeoZagami.com. His books are at infowars.com, infowarstore.com. Leo, did I hear you right?
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  Yeah, no, you heard me totally right. Of course, this will come as an heresy for many Christians and God forbid I'm taking into that direction.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  No, absolutely. I always believe that Jesus, for me, is the Lord in the sense that he incarnated God in his essence.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  But the fact that he died on the cross, that's another matter because as I, for many years, was part of the Knights Templars myself.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  I was part of this New World Order. I saw certain things and I learned certain things that in the end demonstrated that Jesus didn't die on the cross
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  and that the Quran, which actually says that somebody else was sent there at the last minute, dying for him, might actually be correct.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  This doesn't mean I'm not condoning anything in regards to Islam against Christianity.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  That is completely wrong because Jesus made certain teachings very clear. And of course, these animals, like the Cardinal in Sri Lanka calls them animals because they are animals, are Muslims.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  And the religion is very combative, is a warrior caste religion.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  And of course, it has nothing to do with Jesus, who is bringing a message of peace into the world, not only of conquering the world, to then give it into the hands of God and of Jesus because even the Quran is stating that.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  In the Quran, actually, in the end times, is Jesus that comes back because Muhammad is nowhere to be seen.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  So it's Jesus who is coming back to then unify this whole show. And that's where the Muslims are hoping we are going to get the tool.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  In the meantime, I remember in the 80s, when there was this important Sufi Sheikh Nazim, he was asked what these entities were, these UFOs.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  He said very clearly that UFOs were driven by these genes, the operators of these craft, were entities, extradimensional entities called gene.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  So this inspired me also in the making of a book which I wrote and I published this year called The Invisible Master, Secret Chiefs, Unknown Superiors and the Puppet Masters, who literally pulled the strings of occult power from the alien world.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  In Mecca, there is even a mosque which is dedicated to these invisible beings, the gene.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  And if you go inside there, it seems completely empty. But if you stay there for more than 10 minutes, you will be kicked out by an invisible force.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  So hold on a second here, because this is like the next level stuff I really wanted to talk with you about today, but I almost feel like I have to ask you. I mean, if it wasn't Jesus on the cross, not who was it, but then what do they teach happen to Jesus?
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  Well, there is many writings about what happened to Jesus. Some of them were destroyed during the Council of Niceaia, which was this foundation moment for Christianity, but also a moment in which some truths around Jesus were hidden away.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  It is said that he went to spend some time in Egypt. At least I found some evidence that he spent some time in Egypt before going towards the Far East.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  So what are the stories then from the Bible that talk about Jesus coming back to the apostles with his the holes in his hand?
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  Well, of course, but what happens here is that we are believing in a version of events. I'm not saying that my version or the versions that have discovered during my studies are correct.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  I'm just simply saying that you're literally getting into what they teach in these higher secret societies, which by the way, you know, here's the amazing thing too, Leo.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  Well, you have people, Owen, that you can put the nails through there and they can survive because they have reached such holiness that these things don't really touch their body.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  So Jesus himself will have not been necessarily touched, but he had decided to ask that.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  That is important, but he went into the down into the land of the dead. That is also said by who believes he lived on.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  But then he went on to live and there is actually a tomb that you can find. Just Google it, Kashmir, tomb of Jesus.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  And that tomb, the specific tomb is regarded also by the Muslims as being the tomb of Jesus in the far land of Kashmir, which in this moment is also a very delicate situation.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  They're geopolitically because as we know, there is an open confrontation going on between Pakistan and India regarding Kashmir.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  And I mean, here's the thing too, you learn this for whatever reason, it's like the people that are in these occult societies that worship Satan, they really are afraid of Jesus.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  It's like the real Voldemort to them, like, oh my gosh, they shudder at the name and this has always been through history.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  But Leo, here's how I want to leave this interview because it's been so powerful. You know, it's like you talked about the invisible forces inside the Muslim mosque where you don't think there's anything there.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  But I mean, how should I say this, Leo? I mean, what is this world? This world is not what we think it is.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  I mean, you talked about the, I mean, and the other thing too is like, it leads throughout time, have always been into this.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  They've always been into the spirituality and the different realms and everything.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  But now in the 21st century, it's like that's taboo or like low IQ somehow to be into God and alternate dimensions and all this stuff when it's like the most advanced level of IQ.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  Like people that meditate their whole lives want to reach this level of enlightenment.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  And so Leo, I mean, what do you think this is? Because, I mean, when you're sitting in a room and these invisible forces are around you, they are literally occupying the same space as you just in a different dimension.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  Yes, they are. And actually I spoke with somebody who went to this mosque and was kicked out of this mosque after five minutes with the voice, basically the talk to his ear. And then he started to feel a knock here.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  He said, you're not meant to be here. You're not meant to be here. And then they completely drag him out of the place.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  I mean, the guy was not a bullshit. He was really, you know, very devout Muslim and I knew him personally so I can say that he was not alive.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  But Leo, so that's the amazing thing, though. I mean, this is the most, to me, this is the most enlightened, illuminating conversations that you can have, questioning existence, questioning our reality, asking what are these mysteries of life.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  But it's like this weird thing now where it's not even taboo. It's like low, it's like low-balling people. It's like, oh, like, that's old hat.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  Like, you're a caveman talking about creation and God. It's like, what planet do you live on?
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  Well, what planet? Regarding planets and actually stars, Sirius is mentioned two times, I think, at least in the Koran. And Sirius is also something...
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  All right, Leo, this has been an amazing hour. I'm going to get you back on the war room soon. We're going to do this again. Great stuff.

[01:33:47.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  But before I even get to that, I need to take care of business here and put some gas in the tank because we're running low right now and I don't even think I've plugged yet.

[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  I should have kept it, but I think it's on Drudge. See if you guys can pull it up how air pollutant levels are about to go through a real bad time.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  I don't, you know, with all the toxins in the air and then all the pollen and everything. You don't want to be breathing this stuff in.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  And so we don't want to breathe this stuff in. So we're like, hmm, okay, let's go out and find an air filter that we can put in our home.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  And so let's get the best one at the best price and let's private label it and let's sell it at InfowarsStore.com and then we can share the gift of fresh air in the home that we give to ourselves.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  There's the story from USA Today. Bad air is on the rise and then they have a list of, I guess, all the most polluted cities.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  And of course now the studies have come out that your home is as polluted with toxins in the air as the average metropolitan city.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  So don't live like that. Go to InfowarsStore.com, get the Alexa Pure Breeze, the best air filters.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  Money can buy at InfowarsStore.com. I've got two in my home. I absolutely enjoy them. I would not, I would not occupy any other domicile without an Alexa Pure Breeze. Absolutely.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  It's a must have. So are the water filters at InfowarsStore.com. And again, your support at InfowarsStore.com makes everything possible.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  All right, now let me just dive in to the stacks of news that I have here. No rhyme or reason particularly.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  I'm just going to start picking up stories and getting into it. Now this is actually incredible as Alex's NDC, the ACLU.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  You know, I was reading this and covering this and I have another story about this right here.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  You know, how do you even, how do I even properly cover this? I mean, it's the same thing like we have a wide open border.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  Now I've got news on that I'll get to here too. Wide open border guns coming across, drugs coming across, human trafficking.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  I mean, it's all going on. Hey, nothing to see here. Don't build that wall. No national emergency. And it's Trump's fault actually.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  Somehow it's Trump's fault too. You know what I mean? So that's as insane as it gets.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  I mean, you just look at that. It's basic common sense. You have a border. You have a country. You have a border. We have no border.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  And then we also pay for everyone to come here. And then we pay them when they get here. It's madness that this is happening.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  It's maddening. And Americans are fed up with it. But I'm not even sure what's worse. Is it that you have, to me, by the actual US code, these are treasonous politicians.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  These Democrats are committing treason by the US code, allowing these non-citizens to come into this country.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  They're killing people. They're spreading disease. They're committing crimes. It's all in the US code. And the Democrats are committing treason.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  Now, I don't know how many times I have to highlight this, and I'm not going to make the crew go grab the actual document from my desk.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  I covered it in Osium. But it's like, okay, so there's one level of just total insanity that we're enduring, but I'm not sure what's worse.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  So you have the 2020 census coming up. President Trump says, I just want to have a question on the census that says, are you a US citizen?
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  And the average response would be, that's not on there already. And of course it was. It was on the census for 200 years until those Democrats got ahold of it.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  And they took it off. And so the Supreme Court is about to hear this. And justices seem ready to, okay, asking citizenship on census.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  Well, of course. And here's the thing. They've already run through all the loops and all the hoops and all the red tape with these damn treasonous Democrats who want to bring in the third world population to vote them into power.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  They already wrote all the laws. No other government bureaucracy, not the IRS, not the CIA, not the border patrol, not ICE, nothing.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  No one can use the US census. It cannot be used. It's already written into law. It's all confidential and it can only be used by the Census Bureau.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  If anyone else uses that data, they're criminally charged. So they've already written all of this into law.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  And what are the Democrats saying now? Even though they've already written the laws, these people are insane. They write the laws.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  They already have all the laws on the books and then they keep bitching about the problem they already wrote the laws about.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  They say, oh, ACLU, the ACLU, we can't have a citizenship question on the test. Then ICE is going to use it to arrest noncitizens.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  Well, okay, first you say, uh, so wait a second, you're now openly supporting criminals.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  I mean, you're now openly supporting lawlessness and they are, but that's not even the problem.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  So sure, it's one level of insanity that you now openly support crime.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  But let's just leapfrog the fact that you now openly support criminals in this country.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  And let's now go to the point that you don't even want a question, you're so brain dead, you're so committed to your treason and your political correct insanity.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  You don't even want a question on the census that asks, are you a citizen?
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  So we have no idea how many people are in this country illegally. And you know, I don't know how much I want to get into this.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  In fact, screw it. I'm just going to do it here on air. This is what I'm going to do. Here's what you need to do, folks.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  And I already know census workers, so I'm just going to do that. I'm blasting this out to everyone, so it's about to go around.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  Everyone's going to hear this now. You need to sign up to be a census worker and go work the census.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  And I've talked to census workers. You know what they tell me? They are stunned how many noncitizens they find that are living in their neighborhood.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  Stunned. Stunned. And I've already put the idea in some people's heads. I'm just putting it out there now.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  Sign up, work for the Census Bureau. And I think you know where I'm going with this. Don't do anything illegal.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  But you want to see how bad it really is? Work for the Census in 2020. You'll be stunned.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  But they don't want to know. They don't want this problem to be solved. They want illegal immigration.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  They want them to stay here. They want more welfare. They want to break this country's back.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  Why? Your guess is as good as mine. These people are Satanists. They're treasonists. They hate people. They're blackmailed.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  I don't know what their problem is. They're just programmed this way. By the intelligent design. This is just the battle we have to fight.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  But here's the ACLU to fight against the citizenship question on the 2020 Census. And they've got a line of people.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  Someone needs to go to D.C. and bullhorn these people. I mean, what do you do? What do you do with the Democrat Party that doesn't want to have a border
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  and doesn't want to have a citizenship question on the 2020 Census? You want to save the country? You'd lock them all up.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  They're committing open treason. This is an open and shut case. Any legal team or prosecuting attorney or president of the United States
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  that has the Cajones to do it, could do it tomorrow. They're committing open treason against this country. But guess what?
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  They're about to show you their true colors. When the Supreme Court says, yeah, you can ask citizenship on the Census,
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  they're going to go into complete tirades for non-citizens.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  Stacey, in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force. I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  I appreciate that.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force? Tell us about it.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good. It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste. And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are, they're known to turbo-charge women, and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things in ultimate female force, so I'm glad you plugged it.

[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.

[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  You know, the Bible talks about your body being a temple of God, and it is.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  This is basically just a meat suit with our soul, our spirit, our interdimensional next level
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  touched by God's divinity.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  Existence is trapped in this body, but it's a temple.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  It's how we were designed.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  And that's how God is here on this planet through us, through our existence, through the temple.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  And so, when you realize that, you understand why the devil is constantly attacking your temple.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  You understand why the devil is constantly trying to infiltrate your temple.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  Tries to infiltrate your mind, literally tries to infiltrate your physical body.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  And so, that's what the mark of the beast represents, and it's manifested when they force you to take a vaccine,
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  when they force you to put a chip into your body, and that will come next.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  But that's the mark of the beast.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  I mean, you just look at what's going on right now where they celebrate unhealthiness,
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  and they say, hey, look, if you point out that someone's out of shape and overweight and how that's bad for their health,
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  you're body shaming them.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  No, God gave you one temple to take care of and to experience this existence for yourself through.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  And as soon as the devil corrupts your temple, as soon as the devil can destroy your temple,
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  you can no longer experience this consciousness as you were intended.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  And that's why there's a constant attack, a constant assault on your mind, on your body, and on your spirit.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  That is the devil trying to infiltrate your temple.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  Now, I don't know why I went off on that tangent, but I do have some other news to get to before my next guest joins me.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  Let's get into what President Trump tweeted out this morning.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  Yesterday, I got a little upset and started yelling at the audience. I apologize because, well, not at the audience, but through the microphone because of what happened to the troops at the southern border.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  I mean, just unheard of for US troops to be disarmed by Mexican soldiers on US soil.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  And I was sitting here just, I mean, really upset by it.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  I think the president caught on and he tweeted this out, Mexico's soldiers recently pulled guns on our national guard soldiers probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the border.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  Better not happen again. We are now sending armed soldiers to the border. Mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending and returning.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  Soky.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  It's time, it's just refreshing to have a president that stands up.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  But, you know, honestly, I would have liked to see an Oval Office address on this issue.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  And quite frankly, we still need it. The drugs are still pouring across the border. The human trafficking is still going on rampantly.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  Guns are pouring across, drugs are pouring across. I mean, it's a joke. The president and the first lady you're talking right now at a drug convention or whatever, anti-drug addiction convention.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  We can go to b-roll of Trump. He's live right now.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  And yeah, it probably is the the Mexican army smuggling drugs getting paid off under the table.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  The president is absolutely correct. The cartels run the Mexican government folks. Anybody that tries to get into Mexican politics that's not run by the cartels ends up pushing daisies over 200 times last year alone.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  So that's what's really going on here. Maybe that's what the Democrats are aligned with, but it's just getting worse.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  We've been rolling the b-roll all day.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  Heavily armed men escort migrants across U.S. border surveillance video shows.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  Well, why are heavily armed men escorting migrants across the border? Why would you have heavily armed men?
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  Oh, it's a business. You see, it's a business. Someone's making money. They're either pushing drugs or they're trafficking humans, folks.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  They're protecting their property. See how that works? No emergency though, no big deal.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  Border Patrol finds abandoned toddler with name and phone number on shoes.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  You know how we end up with an abandoned toddler at the border because we have a wide open border and people in Central America and Mexico know it.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  Shut down the border.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  Trump suggests Mexican soldiers disarmed U.S. troops as a cover for drug smuggling.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  Yeah, and he's probably right.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  And you know, you've got these Democrats that are not Democrats. You've got these anti-American scum. We really need to find a name for them.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  They're like the Red Coast. They're like the original Benedict Arnold's. They're like the new Benedict Arnold's though.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  So you've got the Benedict Arnold party aligned with drug cartels, aligned with human traffickers.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  That's what you have here. And why is it? You seriously, I mean, this is so beyond frustrating for me.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  It's like, and just how, how, why am I having to debate people about having a border?
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  Like why is this even a political football right now? How is this, how is this even real?
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  Why can't we come together to stop human trafficking?
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  I can, I went out, I went out to Democrat offices in Austin and said, can we come together to stop human trafficking at the border?
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  They wouldn't even say yes. They won't even say yes to that.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  Oh my gosh.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  So we're just going to have a wide open border and we're just going to let drugs pour across the border and guns pour across the border.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  Oh, we're anti-gun. We don't want guns. Make gun laws. Well, if you have a wide open frickin' southern border, they'll just start pouring over from the southern border.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  You jack, you idiots. Excuse me. I'm getting frustrated. I need to just put this story down.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  I can't believe we have millions of Benedict Arnold's in this country now. Millions of them.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  One of them is Brian Stelter. You know, this guy, this is so rich. Steve Watson has the story at Infowars.com. I mean, look at this guy.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  CNN Stelter. Trump avoiding correspondence dinner is an attack against the media. Oh my gosh, Brian, you are pathetic.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  You are just pathetic. Can you imagine how pathetic Brian Stelter is in real life?
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  Brian, why would the president waste his time with you? You have no audience. By the way, the latest CNN ratings just came out. They literally have no audience.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  I mean, nothing. Their Cume is like peaking at 300,000. And that's 60%, 70%, 80% of it's just TVs on at hotels and gyms and bars and crap.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  Nobody's watching CNN. Nobody.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  I mean, CNN is getting beaten by reruns of television shows like Family Guy and anything else. CNN is a joke.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  And so, but it's like as they're spiraling into complete irrelevance, they're just begging the president for a bone.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  Throw us a bone, says Brian Stelter. Stelter, here's an idea. Why don't you try reporting something real?
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  I mean, unless you're not allowed to do that at CNN. Maybe contractually, you're obligated to be fake news if you report at CNN.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  But again, so maybe Brian Stelter feels this way. He's such a pathetic loser. He actually says it, though. So he actually goes.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  So, you know, he can be all bitter and tied up inside how he's a total failure, a total loser. Nobody watches his show.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  And fine, I understand how you would feel that way. But to come out and say it, he's coming out begging for attention.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  Like, look at me. I'm a pathetic loser. Please, president. Please give me attention. I'm Brian Stelter. If I, if I polish my chrome dome a little shinier, would you see me then?
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  If I put on face paint to look like Pennywise, would you, would you follow me then, Mr. President?
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  Brian, you guys have no audience at CNN.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  You're a joke. You're an absolute joke, Brian. Wait, what's this? Oh, my gosh. The crew is telling me Brian Stelter is actually called in.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  This is unbelievable. So Brian Stelter is going to join us in the next segment. Apparently, he doesn't like what I've said about him.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  Brain Force Plus is a top-tier, neutropon, focus, clarity, energy. But instead of having a seven times markup, we have a hundred and a fifty percent markup.

[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price. But it's amazing that, of course, he's knocked out the ultimate sleep aid.

[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:17.000]  Well, we just pulled every human being on Earth in the break. I just pulled almost 7 billion people.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  And the results are in. The people of the world agree. Brian Stelter is the biggest loser in the history of television.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  But I'm actually honored to be joined by the biggest loser in the history of television. It's quite a milestone to accomplish for Brian Stelter here today to be the biggest loser in the history of television.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  But he's called in. He has a beef with the president because he won't be going to the Correspondence Dinner, which they didn't want him at anyway.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  So Brian, what seems to be your problem here? Why are you so upset that Trump isn't going to the Correspondence Dinner?
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  You know, the bit doesn't really work until you switch it. So let's just start it back again. Okay.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  Brian, Pennywise Stelter from CNN has just been pulled as the biggest loser in the history of TV. He joins me now because he's upset and he has something to say to the president.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  He realized the president is listening to M4Wars and not CNN. So Brian, you finally have an audience here on the Alex Jones show.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  So what would you like to say to the president?
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  I think that the president is a little man. He's a small man who doesn't have the courage to face a real man like me.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  You know, just because I don't even tie my own necktie or tie my own shoes, my mother is still kind enough to help me with that every morning.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  She just let me brush my own teeth. But just because my own mother has to tuck me in at night doesn't mean I'm a small man.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  And just because my ratings are almost at zero doesn't mean I'm a small man. I'm actually a very large man, as you can see here.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  But I'm mad right now because the president is refusing to go to the Correspondence Dinner.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  Obviously, the president is not aware that the Constitution says he must attend the Correspondence Dinner.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  Obviously, the president has not read the Declaration of Independence, which clearly states the Correspondence Dinner must be attended by the president and his family.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  The president must endure the abuse by the media. Now, I had something very special planned for the president this year, and I know that I'm not the only one.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  But he's avoiding us now, and he won't go to the Correspondence Dinner.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  Well, since the president isn't going to the Correspondence Dinner, Brian, would you care to enlighten us what it is you were going to do?
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  Well, I'll give Infowars the exclusive right now. But all of us in the media, we're going to superglue ourselves together and build a human wall around President Trump so that he cannot leave.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  And we will basically build a human dome to trap President Trump and save the world.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  But he must have found this out because now he's avoiding us. And so I have a new plan. I'm going to sneak on to the White House grounds.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  I'm going to sneak through the fence.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  Through the fence, Brian, you might have to die it for like 10 years before you can sneak through a fence.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  Don't you worry about that, Owen. I'll suck it in.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  Actually, if you look at me from the side, I'm very wide when you look at me from the front, but from the side, I'm actually very thin, like paper, because I'm really just a thin man.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  So from the side, you can see how physically large I am, but from the side, you see how thin my intellect really is.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  So here's the deal, Mr. President. You can try to avoid us, but we will find you.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  We've got hounds like Jim Acosta right now searching the White House for you. Oh, by the way, Mr. President, I came in to the egg roll.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  You didn't see me. I was disguised. I was actually in an Easter Bunny outfit, but I came into the egg roll.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  I know what you did to those eggs, Mr. President, because I tested them on myself.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  And so I know what you did, Mr. President. It's sick.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  Brian, what are you talking about?
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  Well, let's just say I was experimenting with those eggs, but actually now I'm realizing that I didn't have it right.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  And I think I'm going to have to call you back now. I'm having a bit of a problem.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  Okay, Brian. I'm not sure what Brian did with those Easter eggs, but hopefully he gets well before his big broadcast this Sunday.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  Reliable sources that nobody has watched forever.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  InfowarsStore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities. How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  So we have air filters at InfowarsStore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now. We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home. Have clean air. Go to InfowarsStore.com.
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones. And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:35.000]  Folks, your support at InfowarsStore.com is so important because we give a platform to people like American Identity Movement where they would normally just be totally probably ignored by media.
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:50.000]  But luckily, and they hate this, but Infowars has become so big now, the power of this audience is so real that we can give a platform to people like Patrick Casey from American Identity Movement and really help put their work on the map.
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:55.000]  But it's your support at InfowarsStore.com that makes this possible.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  And so we don't want the censorship to then create this other chilling effect that Infowars has had, which is using the power of this audience and this platform to give life to other outlets, other voices, other commentators where other media outlets wouldn't give them that opportunity.
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:28.000]  So I really appreciate the fact here at Infowars that we lift the ships around us up, that we try to build up, you know, the fleet here.
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  And so that's why they want to censor us. So it's not only the information that's powerful.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  And Rob Dew just put out a picture on Twitter of Alex in DC today with just a large contingent of young kids. They hate how powerful our information is. They hate the impact we're having on the youth, but they also hate the fact that this is a platform that reaches millions and millions of people every day.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  And we can lift the other ships around us and then build a fleet of free speech media that the censors are trying to drown right now and sink.
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:15.000]  So your support at InfowarsStore.com makes it all possible. And we've got 50% off all apparel right now. So all the t-shirts, the ball caps, everything, 50% off at InfowarsStore.com right now.
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  So my next guest is Patrick Casey from AmericanIdentityMovement.com. We featured his video yesterday here on the Alex Jones show where he and his partner over American Identity Movement dressed up as clowns and they went to drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  And so of course they got kicked out because they didn't want to play with the kids. But we're going to talk about that now with Patrick Casey.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  So first, Patrick, thanks for joining us. What made you think of this idea to go to the drag Queen Story time dressed as a clown?
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  So first off, minor correction, I actually wasn't able to attend this. These were two activists who attended in Louisiana, you know, locals who live in New Orleans.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  But they did give me the rundown of what exactly they did, what it was like from their perspective. And I did have somewhat of a role in planning, you know, helping to plan this out.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  Okay, I apologize for that misinformation. So basically, these were locals in New Orleans that just worked with you guys at American Identity Movement, which you had.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  Yeah, they're members of the organization. They're activists. They've done quite a bit in the past as well.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  Okay, so tell me about this then. So did they contact you with this idea previously or did they just kind of tell you they were doing it or how did it happen?
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  Yeah, so basically within the organization, if one of our activists wants to do activism for American Identity Movement, there's a whole process they have to go through, they have to fill out a proposal.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  It has to get approved by our activism department. We have things very structured and centralized so that people don't go off and do something totally outlandish and then expect us to promote it for American Identity Movement.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  So it's something that was kind of in the works for a little while. The organization helped provide funds for, you know, for the materials and the costumes and so forth.
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  But yet, credit to the three guys, can't forget the cameraman who went out there and helped make this basically our biggest action to date.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  Yeah, and it was powerful and this is the kind of stuff, and I don't know if you heard the segment from yesterday, but this is the kind of stuff that we have to do now.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  And I understand there's some conservatives that don't like this tact and I get it, but this is what we have to do.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  I mean, it's the old cliche, fighting fire with fire. It's absolute insanity that drag queen story hour even exists.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  I'm not against drag queens. I'm not against transsexuals. I just don't understand the purpose of having them read the kids.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  Like, what is this all about? And they say, oh, we're grooming them. So they admit what they're doing.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  I mean, they are sexualizing these kids. And then to me, it just gives a bad name to people that just want to be a drag queen or a cross-dress or whatever who have no intention of fondling kids at a library.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:54.000]  But so I think that that was the brilliance of this is dressing up like the drag queens, essentially, in a clown outfit and saying, yeah, here we are for the clown show.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  Absolutely. Yeah. You know, drag queen story hours just so absurd that we thought that going in there and trying to outdo them in terms of absurdity was a good way to draw attention to just how ridiculous it was.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  And I think for most, most people right of center kind of understand that a man who wants to dress up as a woman kind of in an over sexualized way might not be totally right in the head.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  But, you know, there are always going to be people who are a little, you know, eccentric and off center, I guess you could say.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  But in the past, we, you know, people like that understand they need to keep that stuff to themselves, right?
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  They, you know, you want to dress your men, you want to dress up as a woman, well, maybe you should just do it in your house if you're going to do it at all.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  But now what's happened is that deviancy has been weaponized by the left and it's being shoved in our faces.
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  And now there used to be people who did this in the past understood, yeah, this isn't something right.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  So I should do it, you know, I guess, you know, away from the public light.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  But now what they did, what they've done is they've shoved it in our faces and they've said, no, you're the sick one if you don't accept it.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  So it's not kids that are asking for drag queen story hour, right?
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  It's left wing liberal parents who are subjecting their kids to left wing indoctrination, you know, telling them that drag queens are good, you know, right wing conservatives, nationalists, they're bad.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  And it's really just a sick state of affairs.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  And I think that most normal, well adjusted people are capable of looking at the kind of clips that you're showing right now and seeing that this isn't right.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  This isn't the kind of thing that you show to kids.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  It's pretty shocking and I don't think it's a coincidence or an isolated incident and we in fact know it's not now that you have pedophiles infiltrating these groups.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  I mean, it's really easy, you know, to put on a wig or a mask or what have you paint your face and all this stuff, change your identity.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  And all of a sudden people can't go back and look at who you are in the past when you have child sex offenses and other such stuff.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  So this has already happened just twice too in the Houston drag queen story time alone. And by the way, just to kind of highlight the absurdity of all this, not to go down this path.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  But I'm following a story right here in Texas where a father is going through a tough divorce deal with his wife and he's not even like he's being basically told he's the bad person because he doesn't want his four year old boy to be a girl.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  And his four year old boy doesn't want anything to do with this. It's the ex-wife, but it's like what you're saying. It's even reaching the court system now too where the court's like, oh, you're bad, you want your boy to be a boy.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  And so, but that's my point is that, look, to the average consumer of politics and current news, they don't see the craziness. They don't see the drag queen story times.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  They don't see the Trump protesters screaming at the sky. So we have to bring this to their attention somehow.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  So yeah, I feel that it makes sense to fight the absurd with the absurd. I mean, I do the same here with some of the stunts I do it in force.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  But yeah, it's like you said, the video and the work that these guys did may have not even picked up or noticed by anyone if they didn't put on the clown outfits.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  Absolutely. Absolutely. And we've noticed that the theatrical, the more theatrical in action that we do, we're going to get more positive reception, but also more negative reception, right?
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  Oh my gosh. This is just, you've got these hairy men dressed up as clowns. I mean, they're dressed up as clowns. They're not trying to be women. See, that's ridiculous too.
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  Some of them look like demons.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  This is not a drag queen. I mean, this is not a man trying to be a woman. I don't know what this is.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  Yeah, it's something and it's something kids shouldn't be around. But something that I wanted to point out at some point during this interview is that there is a degree of centralization to drag queen story hour.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  I think to some extent it is something that's kind of happening, maybe at the grassroots level, but there is a drag queen story hour DQSH nonprofit that was started in San Francisco by Michelle T and radar productions.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  I haven't looked into radar productions, but who knows what would come up if he did. But basically they have, on their website bragging about how they have drag queen story hour chapters all over the world.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  So there is a nonprofit that is organizing these things globally. And I think, you know, for maybe some of your journalists or other journalists on the dissident, right?
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  It would be worthwhile to look into who is funding them.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  Yeah, go ahead. Name those organizations again that are starting this drag queen story hour.
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  Yes, drag queen story hour is the nonprofit on its website. It was founded by Michelle T and radar productions.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  Well, I know that not only will our team of writers, I'm sure be looking into that and filing a report. I'm sure that the audience will be looking into that as well.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  But again, I mean, I can't even believe that they use that picture for their front page. I mean, look at this. It's clearly a dude.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  I mean, masculine features. It doesn't even appear they're trying to be a woman. They just do the cross dressing thing.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  And then you see the kid with the with clearly the leftist indoctrinated parent forcing it on and the kid just is like, what am I looking at?
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  Is this like a demon? I mean, the kid actually has instincts.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  And you have to escape it before it's too late. Haven't you ever wanted to wake up from this nightmare?

[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War One.

[02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:25.000]  Alex Jones figured something out a while back that has really been a key to Infowars success,
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:33.000]  and it's something that I've kind of discovered myself, and it's what Patrick Casey was alluding to in the last segment,
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:41.000]  how a certain level of absurdity or a certain level of theatrics, as Patrick said,
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:47.000]  is necessary to garner attention to some of the things that you're doing.
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000]  Otherwise, they just kind of fall flat.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:53.000]  And again, I understand why conservatives look at this stuff and they say,
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  oh, this gives a bad name to us or this, that, or the other thing, but this is an infowar.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000]  I mean, this is a spiritual battle.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:06.000]  I mean, look at what the left is doing. Look at the desperate measures the left is taking to try to win for their agenda,
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000]  which is anti-human, anti-American.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  So I mean, we've got to fight fire with fire.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:13.000]  So a certain level of us has to realize you have to fight absurdity with absurdity.
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:18.000]  How do you show and highlight and mirror the absurdity of Drag Queen Story Hour?
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:21.000]  Well, you dress like a clown and you go to Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  But you know, don't you think it really highlights Patrick the intentions here
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:29.000]  or that even they kind of understand that what they're doing is a little sordid,
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000]  that they kicked the clowns out?
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000]  I mean, why can't the clowns stay?
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  Right. Well, I guess they thought that the clowns were being bad right-wingers for drawing attention,
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  bad right-wing clowns for drawing attention to, again, the ridiculousness and the absurdity of Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:55.000]  I do think that there is somewhat of an implicit concession or understanding on their behalf
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:00.000]  that the Drag Queen stuff is sordid, that it is something that is controversial and taboo.
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:03.000]  And that's the whole reason why they're doing it, right?
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.000]  I think there's a sense of, oh, this is taboo, this is wrong, but they're doing it anyways.
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000]  No, that's a good point.
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:16.000]  The very conception of it is the acceptance of the reality that it's taboo and sordid.
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.000]  And it's like, this is what we have to do to kids, we have to get them used to this.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:28.000]  So this is part of the broader attempt by the left and by globalists on the right as well
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:33.000]  to poison our traditional values and basically our culture.
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  What has traditionally been seen as normal and healthy in America and more broadly the West has been inverted.
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  Now what was once virtue has been made vice and what was once vice is now they're trying to make it virtue.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:50.000]  Well, I'm going to make a prediction right now because I understand how these things work.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:54.000]  And sometimes it takes some time for people to understand this.
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  But when you've been in the infowar long enough, you realize how real it is.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000]  This is like a slow rollout.
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.000]  It's like, what can we get away with? How far can we take it?
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.000]  The same principle applies for these people in abortion.
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000]  How far can we take abortion? How much I mean, can we kill a live baby?
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000]  Can we abort a one year old? I mean, they'll keep pushing it as far as we'll let them.
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  So here's my prediction.
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:22.000]  They're going to eventually bring drag queen story time to public schools and they're going to bring it to kindergarten first grade classrooms.
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:28.000]  That's where this is going unless there's a massive pushback and that's the key.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:33.000]  If they can continue to push this and there's not a big pushback and they can continue to do drag queen story hour.
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:41.000]  And let's say, I would say if they have a success rate, let's give it a number of, I would say either six out of 10 or seven out of 10.
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:48.000]  If they have 10 drag queen story times events and seven of them are successful and only three of them have a pushback, they'll move it next level.
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:59.000]  If they have 10 drag queen story time events and five or six of them have a protest or get disrupted, they'll realize, okay, this isn't going to go any farther than this and they'll start to ratchet it back.
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:09.000]  And so I think that's where we're at right now. And I would even say maybe it's time to go next level and you actually pretend to be a drag queen and see what kind of stuff that you can find out.
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  Or even when it's your turn to be like, you know, kids, this is actually wrong. What we're doing here. You shouldn't be forced to be sexualized.
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  But that's what I'm saying. That's the battle front that we're on right now.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  Absolutely. And I like the idea of posing as a drag queen. I don't know if that's something I will ever do.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000]  Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know.
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  I'll dress up as a cow.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  Yeah, that's a Crowder thing. That's a Crowder thing. I agree.
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:43.000]  But you're absolutely right is activism works. The left understands that and it's time that the right begins to understand that as well.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  And you know, just regular people, you don't need to have a lot of experiences. You activism like this.
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  If you, if you, if in your city or your town, you're aware of drag queen story hour happening or being about to happen, then you should get together with like minded people.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  Like minded conservatives, nationalists, libertarians, whatever, and just go in there.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  And, you know, you don't even have to dress up as clowns. If you outnumber them, obviously this is peaceful and non-violent.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  But if you outnumber them, you're going to be able to, you know, you know, maybe chant like some kind of slogan or you're just going to be able to, you know, say something else.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  And these people are self-conscious. These people are, you know, they don't want this to happen. They want to be, you know, as perverse as it sounds.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  Absolutely. In fact, the crew is rolling this b-roll right now. I went to a Planned Parenthood rally here and I got assaulted by a drag queen or a cross dresser or a transsexual.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  And I realized something because I've reached a point now, Patrick, where I'm just pressing charges and trying to get anybody arrested who assaults me.
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  I dealt with it long enough now. I'm just, I'm just doing it. And I hate to do that to the police, but it's just, it has to be done.
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  And so I realized, though, I can't even ID my assaulter because they're wearing all this makeup. I don't know who they are.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  They got a wig on and all this crap. You can't even ID them. And of course, that's why these pedophiles are taking advantage of this drag queen story time because they can go in undercover.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  But, you know, here's the thing too. If you don't want to dress up like a clown and do it, you know, that's fine. It's not for everybody.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  Go print a big poster, pull up that psycho freeze frame that we have. You just print a big poster of an image from drag queen story time and just stand outside the library and be like, yeah, you just print that image right there and just hold it outside the library and say,
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  drag queen story time is here and people's eyes will be like, what is that? What is going on here?
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:36.000]  So, I mean, there's other ways that you can fight this and they just pulled up another story about how one was canceled.
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  But I just feel like if they continue to roll this out with success, it's going to eventually be in the schools and then it's going to be on cable television.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  Yeah, we have to push back and that applies to any front on the culture where any issue with the left is trying to assert its hegemony over us.
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  We need to push back. We don't want to give them an inch because obviously they will take a mile. But one thing that's worth pointing out here is, and I know you touched on this yesterday, is that this isn't just conservative fear mongering, right?
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  Drag queen story has been going on for that long, I think, just like a few years. But guess what? Multiple drag queens have been revealed to be sex offenders, right? And I'm sure this is just the tip of the iceberg. I'm sure that if you were to look into the background of all of these drag queens, you would find quite a bit.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  So that's another thing for the Internet sleuths and journalists to look into. So the one most egregious example of this is a 32-year-old Alberto Garza, who sexually assaulted an eight-year-old boy years ago.
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  So a registered sex offender. Guess what? He gets invited into the Houston Public Library to be around kids. And it turned into this big media outrage, as it rightfully should have. And it turns out that the library didn't do a background check.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  They didn't do any...
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  Or it could be a situation, too, where the libraries relying on the drag queen story time to do a background check. Oh, go figure. They let a pedophile slip in.
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  Right, right. I would not trust the drag queen story hour national nonprofit to assert any kind of standard...
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  So let me just ask you this final question, Patrick, as the segment comes to a close. And this is why the activism is so important. My guess is, and this is probably your most viewed video ever,
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  my guess is when your activist dressed up as clowns to do this, they did not expect it would get this attention and would end up on Infowars. They did it because they wanted to be activists. And that's why this is so key.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  Absolutely. They did a phenomenal job and they deserve unending praise for this fantastic action.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  So there it is, folks. The video can be found on American Identity Movement's Twitter, the original, right there. And hey, if you feel like taking action and engaging in activism to stop drag queen story hour from reaching kids in schools,
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  that's where it's going next. Take action today. Thank you so much for joining us, Patrick Casey, of American Identity Movement.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  Thank you for having me on.

[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control. After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth. I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't. It hit me when I was arrested.

[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:39.000]  So much to get to in the hour and a half that I have left here on the Alex Jones show. It's going to be a powerful archive four hours when it's all said and done.
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  Be sure to share this broadcast with your friends and family folks.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  This is the type of broadcast they don't want people hearing because most of the stuff we discuss here, the average American is thinking about or has it in their subconscious.
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:59.000]  They're just distracted by their own lives or a football game or whatever and so they don't talk about it.
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  It never rises to the surface until they see it and they hear it and they see other people think it and they see other people talking about it.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  They see other people are caring about it and then all of a sudden they start to voice their opinion.
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  They start to feel not so alone out there in the universe but they want you to feel alone.
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  They want those instincts that you've buried down deep to stay there because as soon as they come up to the surface, you're not going to accept this satanic one world government and they know that.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:44.000]  So they have to keep you distracted and they have to keep your instincts beaten out of you and then they really have to bully you out of your divine curiosity for the universe and for your existence.
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:54.000]  But they can't stop us at infowars.com and it absolutely drives them crazy and your support at infowars.com is so imperative right now folks.
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  I got to tell you, when I start talking to Alex about expansion here and he starts making announcements about expansion here, you start to get your spidey senses tingling because it's almost a miracle.
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  In fact, it's practically a miracle that we can expand in the middle of all this censorship.
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  First of all, you can just look at TV and if you go and look, the average television show maybe lasts a season or two and never gets re-signed because it fails.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:36.000]  It's so hard to successfully launch a new show. It's almost impossible.
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  I mean, how many shows have they launched on Comedy Central making fun of Alex Jones and infowars that fall flat on their face after a couple months, almost all of them.
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  And then they keep bringing the same guy back. Jordan Klepper has a new thing he's doing now.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  So we've launched shows, David Knight, every morning with the David Knight show and then myself with the War Room in the afternoon drive.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:06.000]  We've been on air now for over a year, almost two years and we've had massive success.
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:18.000]  I mean, that's a miracle in and of itself that we're able to launch new shows and then have sustained success and viewership despite the fact we're basically banned from being broadcast.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  It's a miracle and it's all possible with your support at infowarsstore.com. I cannot thank you guys enough.
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:30.000]  And so take advantage of the t-shirt sale we have going right now. 50% off all apparel.

[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  You're not going to want to miss that. But go to infowarsstore.com. Get yourself an infowars t-shirt.

[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  Don't be bullied out of your free speech and help us expand because that's Alex's plan right now is to begin the next expansion.
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  But it's tough considering the censorship that we endure.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  But with your support at infowarsstore.com, it's all possible.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  Now, I've got this stack of news here that I want to get to about how the Democrats are basically just trying to measure the rope that they want to use to hang themselves with here in the 2020 presidential campaign process.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  But first, here is Tucker Carlson breaking it down last night.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  Democrats say they despise Donald Trump. They seem to mean it. They tell us they'll do anything to prevent him from continuing as president.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  But if that's really true, why are they working so hard to sabotage their own chances of replacing him?
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  Why are Democrats suddenly saying things that all would guarantee Trump's reelection as president?
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  In just the past few months, Democrats have said things that are so out of the mainstream that it's very hard to imagine voters will back them.
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  Just last night on CNN, Watch Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner, endorse voting for felons who are currently behind bars. Watch this.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  Yes, even for terrible people.
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:42.000]  Terrible people? So how terrible is Sanders talking about? Cannibals? Convicted spies? How about terrorists who kill children?
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  Oh yes, said Bernie Sanders. They get the vote too. Unlike the first or second...
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  And honestly, I think that this is one of the less extreme things that the Democrats are pushing right now, to be honest.
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  Who are convicted in prison, like the Boston Marathon bomber, on death row. People who are convicted of sexual assault. They should be able to vote.
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  I think we should have that conversation.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:14.000]  Okay, let's have that conversation. Best to do it right now, actually, because whenever the left tells you they want a conversation about something,
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:18.000]  you can be certain that any dissent on that subject will be banned a year from now.
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  By 2020, questioning whether imprisoned terrorists should vote will earn you a trip to the HR department and a lifetime ban from PayPal and Twitter.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  So, while we still can, consider the story of Zhokar Zarnaev.
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  Zarnaev first came to the United States, you will remember, on a tourist visa with the rest of his family from Kyrgyzstan.
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  All of them promptly claimed asylum here. They were given it.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  Over time, Zarnaev's collected more than $100,000 in taxpayer finance government benefits. In 2012, Zarnaev received U.S. citizenship.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  And then, less than a year later, he murdered three people and maimed hundreds with a pressure cooker bomb at the Boston Marathon.
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  Now, he's on death row. So, Democrats hear that story and they feel outraged. It's not that immigrants repaid.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  What does dead brother vote, too? The terror attack that may bother you, doesn't bother them. The injustice they're enraged by is that a convicted terrorist might not be allowed to help pick our next president.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  That's outrageous. No, I think it should go farther. I think his brother, his dead brother, Tamerlan Zarnaev, should vote, too.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  Sure, Estani refugees like the Zarnaevs have faced historically in this country. Maybe they need reparations.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  Give them two votes. They definitely need a voice, sort of the convicts of West Feliciana.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  But so here's the thing. I mean, honestly, that's like the least radical thing that the Democrats are doing right now.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  I mean, at least felons in this country, which we did the number, it's probably about six million.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  So, yeah, the Democrats need six million votes. That's really what this is. There's about six million felons that can't vote in this country.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  And so, the Democrats are pun not intended dying for votes right now.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  And so, yeah, they want to try to tap into that six million felon voters is what they want to do.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  Or they'll use that to steal six million votes.
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:06.000]  I mean, that's really what they'll do though. Oh, yeah, we're giving you the right to vote.
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  And then they'll just say you'll have six million Democrat votes magically, like every felon will vote Democrat, you know.
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:16.000]  And so, that's what they'll do. But that's like the least radical thing the Democrats are going.
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  The Democrats have dead people voting. The Democrats have people voting twice in districts that they don't even live in and haven't lived in for decades.
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  That's all been exposed. The Democrats, they bust in balance in the midnight twilight hour of election night.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  They want noncitizens to vote. They literally want people to come from any country vote.
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  Oh, but by the way, did you hear about Russian influence and meddling?
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  These people are, you know, that's what I'm saying. It's just like, I don't know.
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  Here's the deal. Here's the deal. It's like at this point, we either just take the black pill and just let these people destroy us
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  and destroy our country and destroy the West or you're literally going to have to start locking these people up.
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  You don't have to jail them. Put them in insane asylums.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:13.000]  These people are in a total uproar over Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  Their own people admit. Rosenstein, all of them admit. Zero votes were impacted. Zero. No votes changed. But yet they're sitting here pissing and moaning over Russian collusion and Russian meddling.
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  Meanwhile, they've wide open southern border and they want anyone to cross it and vote.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:32.000]  Folks, that's mental illness. That's insanity. They belong in an insane asylum.
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  So we can either decide to wake up as humans to reach down in our pants and grab our nuts and say, we're not going to be destroyed by you psychos or go ahead and take the black pill and enjoy the show as they destroy this country and destroy freedom in the West.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  That's your choice. Not up and take these people to the insane asylum where they belong or enjoy the destruction of America.
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  You can either enhance your day to day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance, perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male pack.
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny. Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:44:09.000]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Leilani estates. But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:22.000]  The ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:28.000]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:50.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:56.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:04.000]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:13.000]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates. But I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under. You're our only sponsors.
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  And when you don't buy the products, they're absolutely the best out there. We aren't able to continue on.
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:30.000]  So remember, you are the info war. I'm not the leader. You are the leader. When you take action, nothing stops you. We've got giant specials running right now at infowarstore.com that are unprecedented.
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:38.000]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  So I want to thank you for your support. I want to encourage you again. Go to infowarstore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible. Thank you for making it for us possible. God bless you.
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:21.000]  We've got the adults. We've got the krill oil. If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:28.000]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. It might be. I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:39.000]  I eat five cants of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:49.000]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is. So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  But you know what? I'm just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:10.000]  I went to everybody's head about the best.
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  Well, you know, we got another special guest. He's been on before, but he's coming back on in the fourth hour.
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  Oh my gosh, man. You've got Humpty Dumpty on CNN, cheering on destruction of America.
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  And you've got the Democrats engaging in... Democrats are literally engaging in terrorism and treason.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  I mean, you know, I'm not going to... I'm not going to water down my words. Let's call it what it is.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  The Democrat Party is engaged in terrorism and treason. Period. That's it. The Democrats are terrorists.
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  Oh, Owen, you can't say that.
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  Really? They said it. Project Veritas got undercover video. They had a guy named Aaron Black, who's literally job it was to engage in domestic terror.
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:24.000]  They got caught. They shut down a Trump event in Chicago with their domestic terror.
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  What do you think Justy Smallette is? What do you think having open borders is?
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  It's all treason. The Democrats are open terrorists and treason. I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  Look, again, it really comes down to this, folks. Americans can either get real or just enjoy the show.
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  Because the Democrats are going to destroy this country. They already are.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:09.000]  The good news is, though, you know, the left is really confused right now about what bathroom to use.
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  You know, there's this big bathroom debate. So the good news is the Democrats have actually solved this issue.
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  This is big. The Democrats have actually solved the bathroom issue. Just poop in the streets.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:29.000]  So the Democrats have solved the bathroom issue. Just go in the streets. Just do it in the road.
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:36.000]  That's what they do in San Francisco. So I credit the Democrats for creating all of these crap jobs.
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  You really have to give them credit. I just can't even believe it, man.
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  I just can't even believe we're going to have to sit here and watch the destruction of America.
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  And, you know, so many people look at the president as the last hope to stop this, and he really almost is a man alone.
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  But, I mean, he needs to know we have his back. I mean, there needs to be more activism.
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  These people have to be exposed. But it's sad. You know, millions of Americans have no idea what's even going on.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  They're following their favorite sports team or their favorite TV show or obsessed with the Game of Thrones.
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  And they'll just wake up one day and walk outside, and America will be dead, and they'll say, what the hell happened?
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:26.000]  Well, while you were zombified, while you were in a trance, Democrats destroyed this country.
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  They opened the borders. We got floods of illegals. They didn't let them vote.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:34.000]  So then they voted for whoever would give them free stuff that then destroyed our economy.
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  And now we have nothing. Thanks, though. Hope you enjoyed the ball game.
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:44.000]  So, I'm just going to sit here and watch it, folks.
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  And, you know, I've only been here at InfoWars for three years, and I've only been doing politics and news for, I guess, about five or six now.
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:02.000]  And I just, so many times, I just understand Alex's frustration because it's just like, you're just sitting here.
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:07.000]  It's like watching your kid drown.
[02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:13.000]  Let me get back into this news, though.
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:21.000]  Now, we've got the new talking point coming out, and I, we all said this would happen.
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:29.000]  The new talking point coming out against Trump or the Russian collusion narrative to try to breathe new life into it is Don McGahn.
[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:30.000]  Here's a series of headlines.
[02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:37.000]  White House plans to fight House subpoena of former counsel Don McGahn for testimony on Mueller report.
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:43.000]  It's all a bunch of BS. It's just keeping the story going. It's just keeping the obstruction going.
[02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:46.000]  It's just trying to keep the boot on America's neck.
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:55.000]  They can't let President Trump do his job. They have to keep him battling this fake collusion narrative all day with lawyers and everything.
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:52:01.000]  Democrats ask Trump, and Trump says no, signaling a bitter fight ahead.
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:05.000]  So they're not going to cooperate with this investigation.
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  And then the Democrats are going to say, oh, see, Trump is obstructing justice.
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:12.000]  Trump says, no, no, no, they're actively engaged in treason.
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:17.000]  It's like, if you try to stop treason, you're somehow, you're somehow the bad guy.
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:21.000]  Like if you fight back against, oh, it's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:26.000]  It's like, you should just be raped. You should just let the murderer murder you.
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000]  Just bend over and take the rape. Don't fight back.
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  Oh my gosh. Did you see that victim of rape? That victim of rape tried to fight back.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000]  That's a rapist. It's like what they do.
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:42.000]  Oh my gosh, that, that person just got murdered, tried to stop, tried to save his own life.
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  That murderer.
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:48.000]  So here's Trump. These people are openly engaged in treason.
[02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:51.000]  And so he's trying to stop the treason, and they say, look at Trump.
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:54.000]  He's committing treason.
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  Dems clash with Trump officials on subpoenas. Tax returns.
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000]  Oh yeah, get ready. That'll be the next one.
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:02.000]  The taxes, the taxes. Oh, Rachel Maddow found the taxes.
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:06.000]  Rachel Maddow can't even do two plus two.
[02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:10.000]  Politico, politico, you people.
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:14.000]  This is risky. Trump's thirst for Mueller revenge could land him in trouble.
[02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:18.000]  Again, here's the Democrats and everybody just openly engaging in treason.
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:24.000]  Trump trying to stop it, and they say, oh, Trump is trying to stop treason against America.
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  How dare he?
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:31.000]  Oh, that individual tried to stop the assailant from raping her.
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:34.000]  She's a rapist.
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:39.000]  Did you see that victim that just got stabbed in the throat to death?
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000]  That victim tried to stop the stabbing.
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:44.000]  They tried to take down their assailant.
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:47.000]  That's a murderer. I'm glad they got killed.
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000]  That's their mindset.
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:52.000]  But no, that's what they're trying to impart on you.
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:55.000]  They want you to be that fooled. They want you to be that dumb.
[02:53:55.000 --> 02:54:01.000]  And sadly, many Americans are.
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:10.000]  When you got Brian Stelter on TV, do you know he was only 33 years old?
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:15.000]  Stay away from doughnuts, kids.
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  Biden said to announce presidential run on Thursday in a video that shows you how pathetic his presidential campaign is about to be.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:25.000]  He can't even do it live in person.
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:30.000]  Oh, crazy Uncle Joe Serial Groper Biden.
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  That's going to be fun.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  It's either going to be the presidential race we deserve is Bernie Sanders versus Trump.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.000]  The presidential race that we're probably going to get though is going to be Biden versus Trump.
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  And it's going to be beautiful.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  So we're not even going to have real, it's not even going to be real crap.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  It's going to be here's Joe Biden and all his crimes and all his Ukrainian collusion.
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:52.000]  And by the way, he can't keep his hands off of 12 year old girls chests.
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  It's disgusting.
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  Maryland Governor Hogan says he's seriously mauling a presidential run criticizes Trump's very disturbing behavior.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:06.000]  So you've got all these no name Democrats now popping into the picture.
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000]  There's like 25 that are going to be running now.
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  They've already set a record.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:10.000]  Who told you that was going to happen?
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:11.000]  Info wars.
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  And then you've got these other weak chicken neck Republicans like Bill Weld trying to run against Trump.
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  Oh, Bill, stay home.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  Save yourself the embarrassment.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  Bernie or bust the Sanders supporters who will back Trump if their man isn't the Democrat nominee.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000]  Well, that already happened.
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:40.000]  Folks, if they don't, if we have a, if we have a real presidential election and the votes aren't rigged,
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  President Trump will win in a record landslide.
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:46.000]  Won't even be close.
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  Won't even be close.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  There's no candidate on the Democrat side right now that could even hold a candle to Trump.
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:57.000]  The most popular is by far Bernie.
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  But you got to remember Bernie already ran a failed presidential campaign where half of his voters sued him.
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  They know he's a total cock.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  They know he's a total fraud.
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  So, I mean, Trump could honestly get 70 million votes.
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  I think that'd be a record.
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:30.000]  Because you got to understand, folks, a lot of conservatives and Republicans, they didn't vote for Trump.
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000]  They were still deceived by the media.
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:35.000]  They were still deceived by the Republican neocon establishment.
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  They didn't vote Trump.
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  They're now voting Trump.
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  You're talking tens of millions of voters.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  And don't forget about all those Democrats in the walkway movement too.
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  I mean, in a fair election, folks, Trump will win in a record landslide.
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  But we're not going to get a fair election.
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  The Democrats are already bringing in non-citizens to vote.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  The Democrats have already been caught busing in ballots at the midnight hour during election nights.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  The Democrats have already been caught registering dead voters, registering people who have moved to vote.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  The Democrats are already cheating six ways to Sunday.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:14.000]  And they still couldn't beat Trump.
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  But imagine if there was a fair election.
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  And you know, I think that that's almost what this country needs more than anything else.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  If we could just have one real election that isn't rigged by the electronic voting machines, just one fair election,
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:34.000]  just so Americans could see that it would really, I mean, really it would be like 100 Republican votes
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:38.000]  or 100 conservative votes to like 40, 50 million Democrat votes.
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000]  And that would be the picture that people need to see.
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  It's like, yeah, America loves America.
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:14.000]  But it's amazing that, of course, he's knocked out the ultimate sleep aid.

[02:59:50.000 --> 03:00:12.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:35.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:42.000]  New York City was well on its way to boasting a proposed 47 total skyscrapers,
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  which would loom over Manhattan in the coming decade.
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:51.000]  The spires of steel and glass representing the success of a free market industrial society
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  are too much for New York's mayor and potential 2020 presidential candidate, Bill de Blasio,
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  a self-evalued socialist who aims to take the baton from Alexandria Ocasio Cortez
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  and plunge the failed Green New Deal into the heart of America's financial hub.
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:12.000]  And I happen to have one here.
[03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  The one NYC 2050 plan.
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  This is just the introductory book.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  There's nine books total.
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  It talks about what this city needs to look like in 2050.
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:30.000]  But it begins with the assumption that we have to make sure we're still here in 2050.
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  The New York City Green New Deal is a $14 billion effort to change things while we still can.
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:44.000]  For the first time on Earth, a major city says no more.
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:49.000]  It's now law that our buildings must do the right thing for the people of this city.
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:54.000]  And I want to be very clear, the landlords who play by the rules are not going to have a problem.
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:02:02.000]  If any landlord does not achieve these goals, be subject to fines of up to $1 million per year.
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  You made quite a bit of news last week when you announced that New York City will now guarantee
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:14.000]  healthcare to anyone who needs it, including 300,000 undocumented immigrants
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  at the cost of $100 million.
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:22.000]  But what do you say to people who say they don't want to pay for the undocumented?
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  I'll answer that.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000]  Everyone should have a right to healthcare.
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  Here's the idea. Everyone should have a right to healthcare.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  To help close a $14 billion hole in its capital budget,
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  the mayor would consider supporting a range of initiatives, including the East River tolls,
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:41.000]  or raising some or all of the taxes that now help fund the mass transit agency.
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  No tolls, absolutely not.
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:44.000]  Combs down.
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:48.000]  Mayor de Blasio's comrade, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo,
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  has enacted policies creating a $2.3 billion black hole in New York State's budget,
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  which Cuomo has continually blamed on President Trump's tax cuts.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  Let us address our issues, our very real issues with a progressive agenda, not a regressive agenda,
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:16.000]  an agenda that moves us up, forward, and united, not down, backwards, and divided.
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  It may surprise you, but I don't fault our federal government
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  for causing the underlying fear and frustration.
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  But I fault them for something worse.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  I fault them for a failure of leadership and government malfeasance.
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  But it's actually the policies of Cuomo and mayors like de Blasio
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  accelerating New York towards a financial crisis.
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:48.000]  As The Hill reported, New Yorkers pay an average of 12.7% of their income in state and local taxes,
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  and face some of the highest property taxes in the nation.
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  New York City, where more than 40% of the state population lives, is the most expensive city in America,
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  with affordable neighborhoods riddled with crime and homelessness.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  It's no wonder why people are fleeing in droves, with 1.2 million New Yorkers leaving since 2010.
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  Last year, New York had the largest overall population loss in the nation,
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  adding insult to injury, a measles outbreak, the magnitude of which has not been seen in 25 years,
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:28.000]  has gripped the five boroughs, especially in Brooklyn, where de Blasio is forcing mandatory vaccinations.
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:35.000]  New York City, much like San Francisco, has become yet another mad scientist's laboratory for socialism,
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  a dangerous, creeping disease that could take the U.S. financial system down with it.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000]  John Bown reported.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:59.000]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship,
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:07.000]  and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most varied, the most suppressed.
[03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:15.000]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant, leftist authoritarians,
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:20.000]  like the young turds and others, get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:26.000]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:30.000]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary, and others are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:37.000]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000]  This country is in a war.
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:43.000]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you,
[03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:47.000]  if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us,
[03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:50.000]  and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands.
[03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:57.000]  InfowarsStore.com, thank you.
[03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:26.000]  Infowars.com, we're all Alex Jones.
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:31.000]  Go to Infowars.com for written information.
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:34.000]  Infowars.com.
[03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:39.000]  I just, guys, I just don't think, I just don't think I have the energy today to do fourth hour.
[03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000]  I just don't think I can do it, guys.
[03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:44.000]  Owen, Owen, I'm getting sick and tired of your BS during the break today.
[03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000]  Been bitching all day off air.
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000]  I'm tired of being a damn cuck.
[03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:52.000]  Take some of the cuck package that we got here and just fix yourself, man.
[03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:53.000]  Fix it.
[03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:56.000]  I'm sick of it.
[03:06:56.000 --> 03:07:01.000]  Okay, I guess I'll try this.
[03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:05.000]  Super, super male vitality.
[03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:10.000]  All right, I'll give it a try.
[03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:13.000]  It says two scoops or two droppers.
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:17.000]  Okay.
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:24.000]  Super male vitality, huh?
[03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:30.000]  I guess I kind of feel something.
[03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:38.000]  Super male vitality from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:39.000]  I don't know.
[03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:43.000]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000]  I'm not totally feeling it yet.
[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:49.000]  Let me try this Alpha Power.
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:53.000]  Alpha Power from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:56.000]  I guess I'll just try this, too.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:01.000]  Two Alpha Power tab supplement pills here.
[03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000]  I guess I'll just try this Alpha Power, too.
[03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000]  Maybe this will help.
[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:14.000]  Alpha Power, huh?
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:23.000]  I think I'm starting to feel something.
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:26.000]  I'm not sure exactly what's happening right now,
[03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:34.000]  but this super male vitality, Alpha Power combo,
[03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:37.000]  I think it's starting to kick in.
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:44.000]  Yes! Yes, I feel the power now.
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:48.000]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000]  For better information, yes,
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000]  if you need more information,
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:55.000]  you're right again.
[03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  That's right.
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:00.000]  I have been uncocked.
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000]  It's the Total Cuck Cleanse
[03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:04.000]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:06.000]  Quit being a cock and take the Total Cuck Cleanse
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:08.000]  from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:10.000]  First, the super male vitality,
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.000]  then the Alpha Power,
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:15.000]  and then the Cuck Cleanse begins.
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  Take back your male vitality
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  with the Total Cuck Cleanse
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:24.000]  That's right.
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:32.000]  Toxic masculinity at its finest.
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  Good job to the crew.
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000]  We did it. We did it live.
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000]  Eff it. We're just going to do it live.
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000]  And I'm just going to wear the small t-shirt
[03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  the rest of the day.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  How about that?
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:44.000]  Or maybe I'll get one that actually fits.
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.000]  Alright, let me put my earpiece in.
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:48.000]  Let's get a crew cam.
[03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  Okay. Let's get a crew cam.
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  Give me a crew cam.
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:56.000]  Great job by the crew.
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:58.000]  Great job by the crew.
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.000]  We tried to do this live on the war room
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  a couple days ago.
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:02.000]  Great job by Connor.
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  Give Connor a round of applause.
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  He really sold it.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.000]  Yeah, take a bow.
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  Great job by the crew right there.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:10.000]  We tried to do this on the war room.
[03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:12.000]  We were sabotaged by Marcos Morales.
[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:14.000]  He hulked my soundboard down
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:16.000]  and it caused a mic outage.
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:17.000]  But you know what?
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:20.000]  We did it live again and we knocked it out.
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  Great job to the crew.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:23.000]  We did it.
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:27.000]  And so that's going to be the Total Cuck Cleanse ad
[03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:30.000]  that we're going to run now during breaks.
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:34.000]  So make sure we get that to A-list ASAP guys.
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000]  And let's start running that in breaks.
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  But here's the deal, folks.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  I actually thought about doing this ad.
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:44.000]  The gimmick is for the radio audience,
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:47.000]  I started in an extra large t-shirt
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  and now I'm in a small t-shirt.
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:55.000]  And so the gimmick is also I had a tiny little cuck megaphone here.
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  It even has C, look, it even is the cuck version.
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  The CMR-15.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  It's the cuck version here.
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000]  And so I even started with the little megaphone
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  and then we advanced to the big Info Wars megaphone,
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:13.000]  which if you play your cards right,
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  this megaphone may end up with you in your hands
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  to fight the Info War.
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  But yeah, this is the cuck mobile ranger megaphone right here
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  that's been uncucked
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:34.000]  and is now the Info Wars welcome to the Thunderdome bitch megaphone,
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  which I have right here, which I'm about to send out to a fierce patriot today.
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:42.000]  This is about to be sent out to a fierce patriot.
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  And here's the deal.
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:46.000]  Don't come in here and try to sabotage this ad now.
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:49.000]  Don't you come in here and try to sabotage this ad.
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:52.000]  This is the one that sabotaged it during the war room, Marcos Morales.
[03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:54.000]  Did you just want to flex your muscles?
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  I just wanted to redo my flex.
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:58.000]  This guy called me out.
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  It was your weak cuck microphone that got cut, cut itself.
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:06.000]  You know, only a real cuck would blame the equipment.
[03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  This is why he has to break his bass guitar after every live show.
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:18.000]  Marcos Morales, ladies and gentlemen, he's been here forever, really.
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  He puts out a lot of the great graphics that you see here.
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000]  The 3D graphics, that's Marcos Morales' work.
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  He does a great job.
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:26.000]  But I'll just go ahead and do this now.
[03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  So first of all, the Total Cut Cleanse.
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  This is a real special at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  And I planned on doing this bit with the t-shirts to promote Super Mail.
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  And it's just the symbiosis that happens here.
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:38.000]  It's really unbelievable.
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:40.000]  And then we came out with the Total Cut Cleanse.
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  I didn't even know this was going on.
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:48.000]  And then it ended up just kind of being the perfect little bit to cut and add for it.
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:50.000]  But take advantage of the Total Cut Cleanse.
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:56.000]  You get Super Mail Vitality and Alpha Power, 50% off in the Combo Pack.
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  And it's got nothing but five-star reviews.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:02.000]  So get the Total Cut Cleanse today at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:05.000]  Maybe we should send some to Brian Stelter.
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:10.000]  Maybe we should send some to Brian Stelter, who I've heard is he may be joining us again.
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:12.000]  Oh my gosh.
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:13.000]  Wow.
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:16.000]  I'm not sure where they found that picture of Brian.
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:22.000]  But kids, you see like drug awareness ad campaigns.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:26.000]  Brian Stelter is the doughnut awareness ad campaign.
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:28.000]  There's the soy face right there.
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:32.000]  Yeah, just take the Total Cut Cleanse from InfowarsStore.com and it'll work.
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  But here's the deal.
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  I've decided to turn this megaphone right here into a story.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  And so I'm just going to do this right now.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000]  And then here's the deal.
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  This megaphone was actually created for a radio audience.
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  It's unbelievable.
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:54.000]  It's got all Infowars bumper stickers and everything totally decked out.
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  You can't even find any original color from the megaphone
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  because it's totally decked out in Infowars stickers and a bunch of customization.
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000]  Just really awesome.
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  So it was the Infowars Army Kansas that was originally using this for the protest that they did.
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  I believe they brought it to Houston for a Trump rally.
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:18.000]  They brought it to a Planned Parenthood protest here in Austin,
[03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:22.000]  which is when they handed it over to Alex Jones in Infowars.
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:28.000]  And actually the individual who was responsible for making this,
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:32.000]  I believe he's joining the Marines now, so we salute him.
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  But he handed this to us.
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:40.000]  Now, we've got some other megaphone that we use and other bull horns that we use.
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:43.000]  And quite frankly, this one doesn't get utilized enough by us.
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  So what I figured is we're going to turn this into kind of like an Olympic torch,
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  if you will, of Infowars.
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  So what I'm going to do is I'm about to send this bullhorn out to a patriot near you,
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  to an Infowarier near you.
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:05.000]  And so this individual who will identify once he receives it
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  will bring him on the war room that I host three to six weekdays here at Infowars.com.
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:13.000]  We'll bring him on the air and we'll show you who gets this.
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000]  And then here's what's going to happen.
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:22.000]  He's going to use it for all of his political activism and all the stuff that he's engaged in.
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:30.000]  And then when he's ready to bestow the legendary Infowars bullhorn to someone else,
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:36.000]  he will then pass the torch and then it will become legend and you will continue to pass it and pass it and pass it.
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  So who knows? Who will be? Who will raise the Infowars legendary bullhorn next?
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:46.000]  It's coming to a patriot near you.
[03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:52.000]  If you engage in political activism, you could be the recipient of the Infowars bullhorn.
[03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:54.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:58.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:00.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:03.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:08.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:10.000]  I can help you too.
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:32.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:38.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:42.000]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:44.000]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:47.000]  The deep state began with World War I.
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:52.000]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:29.000]  So good.
[03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:30.000]  So good.
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:32.000]  I got to heal.
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:34.000]  I do feel pretty good.
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:40.000]  I just took the total cuck cleanse from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:41.000]  I feel nice.
[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:43.000]  Sugar in spines.
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:45.000]  Sugar in spines.
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.000]  No, that's not Maxine Waters.
[03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:50.000]  That's James Brown.
[03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:52.000]  I got to heal.
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:53.000]  Hmm.
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:55.000]  Soul.
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:21:01.000]  See, Maxine Waters stole James Brown's wig because she wanted to get some of that soul.
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:03.000]  She has no soul.
[03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:05.000]  Maxine Waters has no soul.
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.000]  So she stole James Brown's wig.
[03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:17.000]  James Brown's wig, hopefully, she was hoping when she put the James Brown wig on her chrome dome, she was hoping that she would get some of that soul.
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:20.000]  Sorry, Maxine Waters, that's not how it works.
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:24.000]  You have no soul.
[03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:27.000]  You do have a chrome dome, though.
[03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:34.000]  Boy, I'll tell you, you know, please do not do this.
[03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:37.000]  And I'm not saying that I'm encouraging this.
[03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:45.000]  All I'm saying is wouldn't it be funny if someone just did like a, because this has been done before with other like popular YouTubers.
[03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:55.000]  I won't name names or give any context, but it's basically like they say they do a competition where if you can go take the hat off of this person, they get an award.
[03:21:55.000 --> 03:22:02.000]  It's like, what if someone said if you could pull Maxine Waters wig off of her head, you'd get a million bucks.
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:04.000]  Oh my gosh.
[03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:09.000]  No, do not, do not approach Maxine Waters to pull the James Brown wig off of her head.
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:11.000]  Do not, do not do that.
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:14.000]  We don't want to see that chrome dome exposed.
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  All right, we're into the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:21.000]  And I'm going to, here's what I'm going to do.
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:24.000]  I'm going to open up the phone lines right now.
[03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:26.000]  And then I'm just going to knock out the rest of this news.
[03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  Guys, let's go ahead and let's go ahead and open the phone lines here.
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:42.000]  877-789-ALAX 877-789-2539.
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:53.000]  And we'll take your calls on any of the subjects that we've discussed so far today or any of the subjects that I'm about to discuss here.
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:56.000]  We're opening up the phone lines right now.
[03:22:56.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  And in the last couple of segments, I'll squeeze in some phone calls today.
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:07.000]  And then Will Johnson is hosting the war room for me today.
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:12.000]  Let me just go right into this stack here of cultural news.
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:17.000]  Americans getting more inactive computers partly to blame.
[03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:20.000]  And I think it's just in general screen time and smartphones and everything.
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:22.000]  This was also in the news today.
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:26.000]  The lure of computers means Americans are sitting more than before.
[03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:29.000]  Now, here's the thing about this trend.
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:31.000]  And Alex talks about this a lot.
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:36.000]  And I think even humans just kind of know this, but you wonder, is this our destiny?
[03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:37.000]  Is this where Satan is taking us?
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:38.000]  What is this all about?
[03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:41.000]  But it all leads to the same thing.
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:43.000]  Humans merging with machines.
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:50.000]  And eventually our environment and our atmosphere will be so toxic unless you merge with the machine, you won't be able to survive.
[03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:54.000]  See the 5G technology that they're about to roll out.
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:24:02.000]  And so I just sit here and I question, is this really humans destiny?
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:03.000]  Can we stop this?
[03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:05.000]  Do we want to go down this road?
[03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:06.000]  What do we do to combat this?
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:10.000]  Because it just gets worse and worse with the youth.
[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:20.000]  I mean, the average toddler now is engaging in regular screen time.
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:32.000]  And they're putting 5G antennas on top of schools and stuff now, even though they just had to get rid of a cell antenna from a school because it was causing kids to have cancer.
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:33.000]  So just get ready.
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:36.000]  And who knows what they're putting in the chemtrails?
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:39.000]  Who knows what's in the food or any of these adjuvants in the vaccines?
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:41.000]  They could jack something.
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:44.000]  You could have something in your body right now and you would know it.
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:58.000]  You could have something in your body right now that you've either breathed in or ingested that can be targeted and triggered by radio waves, by cell waves.
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:01.000]  Oh, you didn't think about that, did you?
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  You might want to wake up. Vegan feminist café that imposed 18% gender surcharge on men closes down.
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.000]  Paul Joseph Watson has the story at Infowars.com.
[03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  Well, I'm shocked.
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:18.000]  A vegan feminist café, first of all.
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:20.000]  Okay, good luck with that, I guess.
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  That's a fake photo of Michelle Obama they even have on their wall.
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:27.000]  They took a picture of Michelle Obama and actually put it on a woman's body.
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:28.000]  That's hilarious.
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:31.000]  But yeah, wow.
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:36.000]  And then there was sexist against men and you didn't make it in business.
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:38.000]  Wow, I'm so stunned.
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:42.000]  I'm sure you went and got an education in business, didn't you?
[03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  Dumbasses.
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  U.S. Navy drafting new guidelines for reporting UFOs.
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:50.000]  Boy, you know, here's the thing about this.
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:55.000]  I do like to follow the UFO stuff and it's intriguing to me.
[03:25:55.000 --> 03:26:01.000]  There's definitely stuff going on out there. Now, I'm not saying it's aliens or that even I know what it is.
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:04.000]  It could be just secret government stuff.
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:07.000]  It could just be secret stuff, you know, flying machines, what have you,
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  or just stuff that we've never really been able to explore before until now.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  But this to me says they just don't want this stuff going out for whatever reason.
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:22.000]  They don't want people to be looking into UFOs and stuff.
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:26.000]  You know, this one really intrigues me here.
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  I really don't understand this one because I'm a big movie fanatic.
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:36.000]  In fact, I used to be a, I used to review movies, even professionally.
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:38.000]  So I just don't understand.
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:40.000]  Box office preview.
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:46.000]  Avengers Endgame preps for record $900 million global vow.
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:50.000]  Avengers Endgame prompts theaters to plan 24 hour screenings double the popcorn.
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:55.000]  So first of all, as a moviegoer and a fan of movies, I don't understand this whole Avengers.
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  It's like an obsession.
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:04.000]  But you notice how it's all this, what you're seeing with all these big movie pushes.
[03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:09.000]  There's all this propaganda, not just like the leftist propaganda, but it's always Endgame,
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:13.000]  Final Battle, End of Humanity, Geostorm.
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:20.000]  It's this, they're programming your consciousness to get ready for the end of the world.
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:25.000]  Which again, they'll say they have the solution, plug yourself into this machine,
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  and you can live forever and be free.
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:31.000]  No, you just died and became a slave as soon as you did that.
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:36.000]  This headline is almost the epitome of everything that's going on right now.
[03:27:36.000 --> 03:27:41.000]  As Coachella Raged, the LA tech world made plans to live on Mars.
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:44.000]  So this is just one story from LA Times.
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:47.000]  But let me tell you how this actually perfectly encapsulates the world right now.
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:50.000]  So Coachella is a big music festival.
[03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:55.000]  So basically here you have humans on Earth distracted by all the screens and the cell phones
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  and the vats and the TVs and the Kardashians and the football and everything.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:04.000]  And it's fun and they party and they drink and they do drugs and they're living the time of their life.
[03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:12.000]  Meanwhile, as they're dancing, the elite are planning an off-world life.
[03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:16.000]  The elite are literally getting ready for a separatist society
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:18.000]  and you're gonna be left in the dust.
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:21.000]  But they'll have the whole thing rolled out and ready to go
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:24.000]  so that when you finally realize that you're about to get killed,
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:28.000]  you'll be ready to jump on to whatever ship it is they promise
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  or whatever life technology extensions that they promise.
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:33.000]  But this is what's going on.
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:37.000]  As the world is dancing and drinking and getting drunk and high,
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:44.000]  the elites are planning a separate society and you're not invited.
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:47.000]  You get nothing. Enjoy your football.
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:50.000]  Enjoy your sports. Enjoy all of your partying.
[03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  You're about to be done.
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:57.000]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:29:00.000]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay heating pads.
[03:29:00.000 --> 03:29:03.000]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:32:45.000 --> 03:32:48.000]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:32:48.000 --> 03:32:50.000]  This is X2 Original.
[03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:53.000]  Now back at M4WarsStore.com.
[03:32:57.000 --> 03:33:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.000 --> 03:33:13.000]  M4Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:33:13.000 --> 03:33:16.000]  Keep it from you.
[03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:18.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.000 --> 03:33:21.000]  Just to put an end cap in this stack of news here.
[03:33:21.000 --> 03:33:26.000]  Elon Musk says machine to connect human brain to computer is coming soon.
[03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:28.000]  Don't worry, folks.
[03:33:28.000 --> 03:33:32.000]  M4Wars tomorrow's, well, M4Wars, next decade's news today.
[03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:34.000]  I mean, it's not going to be trendy.
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:35.000]  It's not going to be fun.
[03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:36.000]  It'll roll it out that way.
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:38.000]  Oh, but it won't last.
[03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:39.000]  Here's a funny one.
[03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:44.000]  No makers invest heavily in electronic vehicles despite still low demand.
[03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:50.000]  And that on the heels of a new study coming out, electronic cars emit more CO2 than diesel vehicles.
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:54.000]  But it's just the left in a nutshell.
[03:33:54.000 --> 03:33:59.000]  Give you something that you don't want for a price that you can't afford.
[03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:01.000]  That's just what they do.
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:05.000]  All right, we've got open phone lines now and the callers are ready to go.
[03:34:05.000 --> 03:34:07.000]  Let's start with Margaret calling in from Oklahoma.
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:09.000]  Thanks for calling today, Margaret.
[03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:10.000]  Go ahead.
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:14.000]  I've actually called in before about Schaefer Cox.
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:15.000]  Okay.
[03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:20.000]  And I think you said one time that you really, really wanted to help Schaefer Cox.
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:21.000]  Well, I just think it's sad.
[03:34:21.000 --> 03:34:27.000]  I mean, Schaefer Cox is an American patriot who was jailed illegally, in my opinion.
[03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:30.000]  And yeah, he just kind of rots in a jail cell.
[03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:35.000]  And I haven't really seen or heard much from or about him lately.
[03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:41.000]  Jordan Page, he's a singer-songwriter and he has a fantastic voice.
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:43.000]  He wrote a song for Schaefer Cox.
[03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:45.000]  It's right there on YouTube.
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:52.000]  Just look up the persecution of Schaefer Cox, Jordan Page, and it's a really beautiful song.
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:53.000]  Okay.
[03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:54.000]  We will look into that.
[03:34:54.000 --> 03:34:55.000]  Anything else, Margaret?
[03:34:55.000 --> 03:35:01.000]  Yeah, you should get Jordan Page and Anthony Clemens on to talk about Schaefer.
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:04.000]  They would love to do that.
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:05.000]  Okay.
[03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:06.000]  Well, we will look into that, Margaret.
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:08.000]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:09.000]  Let's go to...
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:10.000]  All right.
[03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:11.000]  Let's just do this right now.
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:15.000]  Let's go to Jay calling in from Texas.
[03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:16.000]  Go ahead, Jay.
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:19.000]  Yo, old dog, what up?
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:21.000]  Yo, what's up, Jay?
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:22.000]  Not much.
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:24.000]  I'm a second-time caller.
[03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:27.000]  I called before I talked to David.
[03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  Really articulate.
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:29.000]  I love him.
[03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:33.000]  I just wanted to give you props real quick for your veteran show.
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:35.000]  It really helps me.
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:37.000]  It really touches me.
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:42.000]  You had me rolling earlier, bro, when you was talking about Brian Seltzer and that fence, man.
[03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  Brian Seltzer is actually going to be joining us again in the next segment.
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:50.000]  But, Jay, let me just say, the fact that that veteran's call-in show is important to you means everything.
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:53.000]  That's why I do it, and we actually have it this Friday.
[03:35:53.000 --> 03:35:58.000]  The veteran show, we do it the last Friday of every month on the War Room, in case any of the audience is not aware.
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:05.000]  The last Friday of the month on the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m. Central here, hosted by me, we do a veteran's call-in show.
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:07.000]  And I've got multiple veterans lined up for this Friday.
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:11.000]  We always get great veterans' guests on to co-host, and then we get great calls.
[03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:14.000]  So it's something that I'm always excited about.
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:19.000]  And when I hear the veterans call me and say, hey, I love that you do that.
[03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:21.000]  That's what it's all about.
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:23.000]  Oh, yeah, no doubt.
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:28.000]  So, yeah, I'd be praying for you, the whole Info Wars crew, a lot that.
[03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:32.000]  Dude, you'd be out there all in the midst of it, with a red cap on.
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:37.000]  I mean, I haven't been stateside in a long time. I've been overseas working.
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:40.000]  So I don't know the state, what's going on. I'm your age.
[03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  But for you to be out there, you're so brave.
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:44.000]  I saw you last year at South by Southwest.
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:47.000]  I think you interviewed Michael 5000 Watch from Swisher House.
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:50.000]  And I'm like, oh, my God, because it's south of Houston area.
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:53.000]  And I'm like, he's just walking up there with a camera crew.
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:55.000]  Do you have like 10 bodyguards? You're not worried.
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:36:57.000]  You're like a colonel for the Info Wars team.
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:36:59.000]  Then you got like Mike Adams, the health guy.
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:01.000]  He's like the general, David, their general.
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:05.000]  I'm not trying to down your rank, but I mean, we're all trying to fight this war.
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:09.000]  But you're not scared out there? Do you have a vest on?
[03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:14.000]  No. In fact, most of the time now, I go out totally solo.
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:19.000]  I'm protected by God, so I have no fear.
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:21.000]  All right. All right.
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:23.000]  I mean, Jay, you know what I'm saying?
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:29.000]  Your prayers, we have people that they do like weird devil satanic rituals.
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:31.000]  And they try to send demons on us, man.
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:33.000]  Your prayers counter that.
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:37.000]  Your prayers keep us in God's watchful eye.
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:41.000]  Yeah, no doubt. Every day.
[03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:44.000]  Yeah, so next was Savannah Hernandez.
[03:37:44.000 --> 03:37:47.000]  The first time I saw you and her on air,
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:50.000]  I was like, OK, what's going on right here?
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:54.000]  And then she was talking about she played this Cardi B song or something.
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:58.000]  And then you said I digress because, you know, this hip hop music,
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:02.000]  this influence that's over these kids, it's in the movie.
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:03.000]  It's everywhere.
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:06.000]  And it's like a magic spell to have you thinking dancing,
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:08.000]  twerking, turkey, money, money, dollars, material.
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:10.000]  No, but see, but that's what it is, Jay.
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:14.000]  And they use people like Cardi B and they force feed her to the population.
[03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:16.000]  And so kids think it's cool.
[03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:18.000]  You know, she's rich and famous and everything.
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  And she's adult. She's a moron.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:22.000]  She has a low IQ.
[03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:23.000]  And so but it doesn't matter.
[03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:25.000]  I mean, she can be good at music or whatever.
[03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:28.000]  The point is they force feed people like her for public consumption
[03:38:28.000 --> 03:38:33.000]  because that's what they want young people to be looking up to.
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:38.000]  Young people to idolize is someone who's totally fake and has a low IQ.
[03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:41.000]  It's sad. We're doomed.
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:46.000]  And yeah, so I haven't listened to rap music in a while just like Bob Marley
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  or some like classical stuff.
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:53.000]  But the next thing what I really call for is I always hear you beating up vegans.
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:55.000]  Now, hold on a second.
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  I saw the thing you said you wanted to defend vegans.
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:38:58.000]  I don't beat up vegans.
[03:38:58.000 --> 03:39:00.000]  What are you talking about?
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:03.000]  A hardcore info war dude, bro.
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:06.000]  You make jokes about us at the supermarket.
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:08.000]  You joke about the Cal Fards.
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  You joke, you joke all the time.
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:14.000]  You guys are too much joking about it.
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:17.000]  And the thing is, it's serious sustainability wise.
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:22.000]  I mean, we don't have enough land on earth to feed the animals and feed the humans.
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:26.000]  Sooner or later, unless you're a millionaire, you're not going to be able to eat no filet mignon.
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:28.000]  Hey, hey, look, Jay, Jay, I don't know.
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:30.000]  I don't know what you're talking about me attacking vegans.
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:31.000]  I mean, I've covered it before.
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:32.000]  I've made jokes about it.
[03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:33.000]  I understand where you're coming from.
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:34.000]  I'm not anti vegans.
[03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:41.000]  I mean, I've covered events with news stories that have vegans inside of them.
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:42.000]  I totally understand where you're coming from.
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:49.000]  In fact, I do believe if you're a Christian Orthodox, the Christian Orthodox diet,
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:52.000]  I do believe actually says you can't eat any meat.
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:54.000]  Oh, no.
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:56.000]  So I just want to be on the record.
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:39:58.000]  I have nothing against vegans.
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:02.000]  I don't think I could personally do it, but I understand where you're coming from.
[03:40:02.000 --> 03:40:04.000]  Yeah, you're good then.
[03:40:04.000 --> 03:40:05.000]  You're clear.
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:10.000]  My last thing, and I want Alex to hear this, is you guys are killing me with this news.
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:12.000]  It's news, news, news all day.
[03:40:12.000 --> 03:40:16.000]  I know that's what you are, your news channel, but I support Infowars.
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:18.000]  I can't buy Infowars stock.
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:20.000]  I see where you guys are going with the company.
[03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  I like it, but there should be like music videos.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:24.000]  There should be like a cooking channel.
[03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:26.000]  There should be like the Infowars team channel.
[03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:28.000]  There should be all that should be like a full TV show.
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:30.000]  You know, Jay, I hear you.
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:32.000]  I actually hear you and we're on the same page.
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:36.000]  And obviously the challenge is, you know, it takes a lot of money to do that.
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  It takes a lot of money to expand and to hire the crew.
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:40.000]  And Alex doesn't like half assing things.
[03:40:40.000 --> 03:40:44.000]  He wants to make sure that we have a full rollout before we do these things.
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:48.000]  But like when I saw, when I started seeing like flat earthers getting banned from YouTube,
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  I was like, let's have a flat earth channel of Infowars.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:52.000]  Just bring them all on Infowars.
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:54.000]  I don't care if you're flat earth or not.
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:56.000]  It doesn't matter to me. I'm for free speech.
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:40:58.000]  So I see where you're going and I agree with you.
[03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:00.000]  But Alex has a big vision for Infowars.
[03:41:00.000 --> 03:41:05.000]  And so if we continue to get the support, Jay, I appreciate your support and your prayers.
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:09.000]  I mean, if we continue to do that, eventually that's where Infowars will go.
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:11.000]  It just takes time and funding.
[03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:14.000]  And so that's, you know, that's kind of the process we're engaging right now.
[03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:16.000]  And they know that.
[03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:19.000]  And that's why they're doing this whole big censorship thing before the 2020 election.
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:23.000]  Because it's during the election cycles where we get the most support,
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  we get the most funding, we get the biggest audience,
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:28.000]  and people are going to be looking for us again on YouTube and everything,
[03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:29.000]  and they're not going to find us.
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  And so it'll be interesting to see what happens when that phenomenon plays out.
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:35.000]  But Jay, absolutely, you have the vision.
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:37.000]  I mean, that's what we want to do with Infowars.
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:41.000]  And we just go as far as the audience allows us.
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:43.000]  And it's your prayers and your support that makes it all possible.
[03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:46.000]  I was going to take another call here, but Jay, we got 60 seconds left.
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:48.000]  Anything else you want to say?
[03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:50.000]  No, that's it, man.
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:53.000]  I appreciate talking to you until I can cross you over on the court.
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:55.000]  But y'all be easy, man.
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  Like I said, I'm praying for y'all.
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:41:57.000]  And just be safe, man.
[03:41:57.000 --> 03:41:58.000]  Get you another bodyguard.
[03:41:58.000 --> 03:42:00.000]  At least get a 10 test, man, bro.
[03:42:00.000 --> 03:42:03.000]  Are you from Houston?
[03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:05.000]  I'm from South of Houston.
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:06.000]  South of Houston?
[03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:07.000]  I'm playing Houston, though.
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:08.000]  All right.
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:09.000]  Yeah.
[03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:10.000]  Maybe one day.
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:12.000]  Maybe one day we can ball together.
[03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:14.000]  I'm going to beat you at one of these rallies, one of these days.
[03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:15.000]  I'm just over here trying to...
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:16.000]  Come on out.
[03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:17.000]  Hey, come on out.
[03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:21.000]  We've got the Planned Parenthood protest on May 26th coming up.
[03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:22.000]  Thank you so much for the call, Jay.
[03:42:22.000 --> 03:42:24.000]  It's great to hear from you.
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:26.000]  On May 26th, we have the Planned Parenthood protest.
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:28.000]  Stop government funding a Planned Parenthood.
[03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  May 26th, in Austin, Texas, the Planned Parenthood Center on 7th Street.
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  We're migrating from the one on Ben White to the one on 7th Street,
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:40.000]  which is more downtown.
[03:42:40.000 --> 03:42:42.000]  They get free rent from our government.
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:43.000]  So join me out there, Jay.
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:44.000]  I'd love to meet you.
[03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:49.000]  I always love meeting fellow Info Warriors when I host these events and these protests.
[03:42:49.000 --> 03:42:50.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  Final segment on the other side.
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:55.000]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us.
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:58.000]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:06.000]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:09.000]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:11.000]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:15.000]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze,
[03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:25.000]  which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:28.000]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:32.000]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:36.000]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:38.000]  I've got two in my home.
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:44.000]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:43:44.000 --> 03:43:49.000]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:44:18.000]  Clean Air, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:22.000]  And I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.
[03:44:22.000 --> 03:44:26.000]  We have those incredible sell prices back at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:28.000]  On Infowars, select storeable foods.
[03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:30.000]  They've got special diet foods.
[03:44:30.000 --> 03:44:34.000]  They've got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak emergency supplies.
[03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:36.000]  They've got so many great products there.
[03:44:36.000 --> 03:44:37.000]  And you've got a three-year supply.
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:39.000]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:42.000]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:44.000]  If you're buying war bonds, bring you great products.
[03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:47.000]  And together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:54.000]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowars, select high-quality storeable foods powered by my Patriot supply.
[03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:56.000]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:44:57.000]  Go ahead.
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:59.000]  I just have to say something, man.
[03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:03.000]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:04.000]  It just gets old, man.
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:06.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[03:45:06.000 --> 03:45:09.000]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:13.000]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:16.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:19.000]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:21.000]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:23.000]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:24.000]  You know what?
[03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:25.000]  I'll put it on pause again.
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:30.000]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear.
[03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  We're under attack.
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:32.000]  We need your help.
[03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:36.000]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:39.000]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:40.000]  You understand?
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:41.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:43.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info World.
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:50.000]  Do you understand?
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:45:51.000]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:53.000]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:10.000]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:12.000]  and energy supplements.
[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:18.000]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that
[03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:22.000]  sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:46:22.000 --> 03:46:29.000]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:31.000]  and beyond system in the world.
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:33.000]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:34.000]  You must experience it.
[03:46:34.000 --> 03:46:36.000]  It is a total game changer.
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:41.000]  It comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:42.000]  Warning, though.
[03:46:42.000 --> 03:46:43.000]  It's very, very strong.
[03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:44.000]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:48.000]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force
[03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:51.000]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:52.000]  Turbo Force.
[03:46:52.000 --> 03:47:21.000]  Live.com.
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:30.000]  I'm kind of sick of having no audience on CNN.
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:35.000]  So I decided to actually have an audience and fill in for Alex here in the last segment.
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  And I just have to raise a big, a big fuss about something here.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:47.000]  You see, Trump avoiding the Correspondence Dinner is an attack on the media.
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:48.000]  I'm attacked.
[03:47:48.000 --> 03:47:52.000]  I'm being attacked daily by President Trump when he refuses to give me an interview.
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:57.000]  I'm being attacked daily by President Trump when he says we need to have a border.
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  These are the kind of racist, bigoted statements from President Trump that we fight every day here at CNN.
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:05.000]  But we have no audience left.
[03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:06.000]  We've failed.
[03:48:06.000 --> 03:48:08.000]  We've lost all our audience.
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:12.000]  And so I now have to come on Infowars because we have no audience.
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:18.000]  And for the President to avoid us at the Correspondence Dinner where we want to tar and feather him publicly,
[03:48:18.000 --> 03:48:23.000]  we want to lie about him to the American people when we want to destroy and attack him.
[03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:24.000]  That's all right.
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:26.000]  It's in the Constitution.
[03:48:26.000 --> 03:48:28.000]  Read the Constitution, Mr. President.
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:41.000]  It says in the Bill of Rights written in 1692 by Malcolm X that the President has to go to the Correspondence Dinner.
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:43.000]  If he doesn't, he's guilty of treason.
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:44.000]  It's in the Bill of Rights.
[03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:55.000]  And so now the President is openly committing treason against this Republic by refusing to let us ridicule him and lie about him during the Correspondence Dinner.
[03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  So it's an attack against the media.
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:03.000]  It's an attack against me that the President will avoid us at the Correspondence Dinner.
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:06.000]  And it really just goes to show you who the President really is.
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:09.000]  He's too busy fixing the economy.
[03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:12.000]  We just had another record-breaking day in the stock market.
[03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:14.000]  This is what the President chooses to do.
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:16.000]  Record low unemployment numbers.
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:21.000]  This is what the President is doing with his time instead of going to the Correspondence Dinner.
[03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:25.000]  I think that really shows you who this President is.
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:27.000]  Anti-American.
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:33.000]  He wants to support the American people instead of the fake news media that hates him and attacks him every day.
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:35.000]  It's an assault against me.
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:42.000]  So I sign off. I'm going to go have to put some ice on my wounds from all the attacks I've had to endure from the President.
[03:49:42.000 --> 03:49:45.000]  And I'm going to get a fresh box of Kleenexes as well.
[03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:52.000]  So for Infowars.com, this has been Brian Pennywise-Stelter, the biggest audience I've ever had.
[03:49:52.000 --> 03:49:54.000]  Thank you for filling in there, Brian.
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:58.000]  Very nice of you to do so.
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:01.000]  You know, CNN is such a joke.
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:04.000]  They tweeted this out.
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:10.000]  Shima Ishmael was attending a conference of the Islamic Circle of North America in D.C.
[03:50:10.000 --> 03:50:17.000]  when she saw a group of protesters holding signs against the Muslim faith.
[03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:21.000]  She asked her friend to take a photo of her in front of them, so she's trolling them.
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:24.000]  But I looked at the signs.
[03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:28.000]  And all the signs say is that they love Jesus.
[03:50:28.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  But I guess if you love Jesus, that's somehow an attack on the Muslim faith.
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:37.000]  Why doesn't CNN, you know what, we need to do a new CNN logo.
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  And let's just like put a hijab on the CNN logo.
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:46.000]  I mean, we did the CNN is ISIS thing.
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:51.000]  So CNN is ISIS, but CNN is now just openly Muslim.
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:53.000]  And there's nothing wrong with that.
[03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:57.000]  So we should just put the hijab over the CNN logo.
[03:50:57.000 --> 03:50:59.000]  All right, final segment here.
[03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:03.000]  Let's take a couple more phone calls. Let's go to Brad Chadford calling in here.
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:07.000]  Chard Brotwurst in Boston. Go ahead.
[03:51:07.000 --> 03:51:11.000]  Hey, man, I got to say your your stelter impression is not quite high enough.
[03:51:11.000 --> 03:51:13.000]  I think impression. What are you talking about?
[03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:15.000]  I don't stelter impression.
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:20.000]  Morales go in there and grab you by the chode while you do that because I think that would get it up a little.
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:25.000]  Another octave. I think you're a disgusting person. You know that I really am.
[03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:30.000]  But you know what? That's not what I really wanted to talk about. What I wanted to get into is I actually have breaking news.
[03:51:30.000 --> 03:51:35.000]  I called her handsome cafe in Australia.
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:37.000]  What you called them on the phone?
[03:51:37.000 --> 03:51:43.000]  Gender surcharge. Yeah, I did it to discuss their 18% gender surcharge on men.
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:48.000]  And they actually told me that they were rethinking it.
[03:51:48.000 --> 03:51:56.000]  And they were going to allow you and Marcos Morales to get an 18% discount.
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:52:01.000]  They were actually calling it the whole discharge, not the gender surcharge.
[03:52:01.000 --> 03:52:08.000]  So I guess their thing is it's buy women for women, but they said this one is buy women for women.
[03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:10.000]  Well, here's their problem, though.
[03:52:10.000 --> 03:52:14.000]  But here's their problem. I've already outflanked them.
[03:52:14.000 --> 03:52:18.000]  I was planning on going to get coffee there as a woman.
[03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:23.000]  So you see, I was going to identify as a woman and then they couldn't give me the surcharge.
[03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:25.000]  Otherwise, that would be sexist. You see?
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:28.000]  Do differently to appear as a woman.
[03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:31.000]  Well, I mean, I showed the video of Drag Queen Story.
[03:52:31.000 --> 03:52:34.000]  I mean, these guys have big hairy chest and big burly beards.
[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:36.000]  I mean, they don't even really try to be women.
[03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:41.000]  So I'm just going to claim to be a woman and I'm going to go get a cup of coffee and avoid that surcharge.
[03:52:41.000 --> 03:52:44.000]  And if they say that I'm a man, then they're sexist.
[03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:47.000]  Yeah, but you and Marcos get the whole discharge now.
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:50.000]  It's 18% off. So I think it's a good deal.
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:56.000]  So here's the deal. I mean, you can make your jokes here on the Alex Jones show.
[03:52:56.000 --> 03:53:01.000]  But, you know, the liberals aren't going to go to your channel, Brad.
[03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:04.000]  Well, they don't anyway. So what does it matter? I've got nothing to lose.
[03:53:04.000 --> 03:53:09.000]  You're actually smarter than the rest because you're actually taking advantage of the Trump economy.
[03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:15.000]  Because there's nothing. The liberals, they won't, they won't, they don't know what to do.
[03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:20.000]  Yeah, I guess not. I guess not. Hey, I'm going to let you go because I know you got, you want to get a couple more calls in.
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:23.000]  But Tulsi 2020, see you later.
[03:53:23.000 --> 03:53:30.000]  Yeah, you know, Tulsi is going hard against Saudi Arabia and our funding of their crimes against humanity.
[03:53:30.000 --> 03:53:33.000]  I support Tulsi in that challenge.
[03:53:33.000 --> 03:53:36.000]  I just don't think she's going to get any support from the Democrats.
[03:53:36.000 --> 03:53:40.000]  I think they want Biden and so they're going to get Biden.
[03:53:40.000 --> 03:53:44.000]  So unfortunately, Tulsi Gabbard, by far the best candidate that the Democrats have to offer.
[03:53:44.000 --> 03:53:46.000]  I don't think she's going to get a fair shot.
[03:53:46.000 --> 03:53:51.000]  All right, let's take another call here. Let's go to let's do Emerson.
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:58.000]  Let's take another call from Massachusetts today. Go ahead, Emerson.
[03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:01.000]  Five seconds. Emerson, are you with us? Go ahead. Yes.
[03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:02.000]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:54:02.000 --> 03:54:03.000]  Good. Thanks for calling.
[03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:09.000]  Oh, you're welcome. Greetings to AJ. I haven't heard from you in a while.
[03:54:09.000 --> 03:54:11.000]  I'm sorry. What was that?
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:17.000]  Greetings to AJ. Alex Jones, because I haven't heard from you in a while.
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:19.000]  Okay.
[03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:25.000]  So I'm calling today just so I'm going to be briefed because I'm actually working.
[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:37.000]  So I just wanted to say that the felons who committed crimes and they're in jail, they should have no right.
[03:54:37.000 --> 03:54:41.000]  They should have right to have no right. That's what I'm saying.
[03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:48.000]  Well, I look at this issue and I just see it as the Democrats trying to scrape up as many votes as they can.
[03:54:48.000 --> 03:54:51.000]  They know that their party is dying and so they see six million felons.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:57.000]  There's a six million votes that they think they can get, but this is like the least radical thing the Democrats are pushing right now.
[03:54:57.000 --> 03:55:03.000]  I mean, open borders, free education, tear down every skyscraper, illegals voting.
[03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:08.000]  I mean, having felons vote, that's like lukewarm for a Democrat.
[03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  They're not a law-abiding citizen, so they should have no right because they broke the law.
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  That's why they're in jail.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:21.000]  There was not a vacation. They cannot live with the community.
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:24.000]  Oh, you know what? No, no, Emerson, it's actually making sense to me now.
[03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  I see what's happening. Now I see what's happening.
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:30.000]  Now I see the picture.
[03:55:30.000 --> 03:55:38.000]  The Democrats are pushing for felons to vote because they want to be able to vote from jail when Trump arrests them in a few years.
[03:55:38.000 --> 03:55:40.000]  That's what this is.
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:47.000]  Obama wants to be able to vote when he's arrested for treason. Hillary wants to be able to vote from her jail cell when she's a felon.
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:53.000]  That's what this is, Emerson. Thank you for... Emerson, I'm so glad you put that thought bug in my head today.
[03:55:53.000 --> 03:55:55.000]  Thank you for the call. That's what it is.
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:56:04.000]  The Democrats realize that they're all about to end up in jail as felons and so they're trying to be able to vote from prison once they get locked up for all their treason.
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:09.000]  All right, final call. Let's go to Jim in Alabama. Go ahead, Jim.
[03:56:09.000 --> 03:56:11.000]  Hey.
[03:56:11.000 --> 03:56:14.000]  I've been listening to your show today and I'm...
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:19.000]  Wait a second. Hold on. Has Brian Stelter commented, Jim?
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:26.000]  Yes. I'm trying to infiltrate the show and try to stop this madness. You're being applied.
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:33.000]  Brian, will you leave the Infowars audience alone, please? We've given you enough airtime for one day.
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:43.000]  No. No. I'm going to report you to Twitter. I'm going to report all your Twitter channels and you're just making CNN look bad.
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:44.000]  Brian...
[03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:45.000]  I don't appreciate it.
[03:56:45.000 --> 03:56:50.000]  Brian, you make CNN look bad. You're a humpty-dumpty of a man with no ratings.
[03:56:50.000 --> 03:56:58.000]  No. You're just trying to write on my compiles for your own thing. Infowars is trying to use me for their own thing.
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:04.000]  What are you doing here?
[03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:08.000]  All right, Brian. I'll tell you what. Brian Stelter.
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:16.000]  Brian Stelter, you did a great job providing his content. Here's the deal. Folks, I'm going to let you in on a secret. Thanks for calling, Brian.
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:24.000]  The real reason why Brian was so upset is because we don't have a t-shirt size in his size. He's a quadruple XL.
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:34.000]  We're going to do it. In fact, it's not a quadruple XL. We're going to now launch all Infowars t-shirts, or 50% off, and we're now announcing the brand new Brian Stelter size.
[03:57:34.000 --> 03:57:43.000]  It's the quadruple XL Brian Stelter size. So, Brian, we're going to get you that t-shirt, infowarsdoor.com.

[03:58:34.000 --> 03:58:44.000]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible. Thank you for making Infowars possible. God bless you.
